Sorry for my incompetence, but I don’t understand what that means
Edit- just researched it, let me try to find this info

Is there any way to have all of your wallets on the ledger accessible in one place? I love this thing, but it’s starting to get a little confusing with all of the different apps. Btc and ltc are one on the chrome apps, eth is one, my stellar has one on its own that I have to keep a website bookmarked, and ripple, being an actual program downloaded to my desktop.

I had figured that... is there any way to even contact said person?

I bought around .4  and after it rose to 19k, and fell I bought another .101 or so @ 15.3k. In it only for the long term, so not really following the prices too hard. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:59:52
Yeah I bought at 15.3, “dip” oh well, only in it for long term wealth.

I’m not getting a reply option for you comments, it only says it’s a single comment thread, so my apologies. I appreciate the info, you sir are a gentleman. Going to recover my nano in about an hour and see if I wrote my words down correctly thank you!

I’ve been working on raising my limits through coinbase. Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:55:28
Hodled all day, what a crazy day!

I bought .4 at 9.8k, and .3 @ 13.5... so wish I would have not procrastinated earlier.... just don’t want to regret not investing now, 5 years from now
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:56:08
That would be correct. I have a drop down box of options, which none of them are reply. I can only add a comment to the main topic for some reason. I had just been under the assumption that when I create posts, I have some weird option check marked....
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:44:23
Ahhh okay I get it... appreciate the info. Is there any benefit to restoring my 1st nano, onto my second nano, and Keeping them both up to date with my btc and altcoins??
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:14:53
I’m fairly new to crypto, but has coinbase ever worked at a pivotal moment?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:03:55
Wish I listened to my gut, more times than not, when dealing with cryptos. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:19:14
Okay, dunno why I keep setting up my posts as single thread, so sorry for that in advanced. I’m going to do everything you just mentioned... is there any way I can wipe my first nano, by trying to restore the first nano on my second one? I’m kind of hesitant because I’m not too familiar with the lingo, I could see myself doing something unexplainable stupid. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:47:54
Going to do that now, thank you.

Sorry you guys, kinda new to reddit as well tried to delete the thread cause it’s been resolved. Apparently what happened was he accidentally remade the qr code to send to his wallet, thinking he sent it to a random person, and it didn’t show up in his wallet til this morning... feels dumb, but I guess we are learning and now we know. Appreciate all your guys time in replying.

They paired nicely with a wallet that had a big long chain that clipped to your belt loop. I had a couple pairs.

I send around 3k of stellar to my poloniex wallet incorrectly and it took them about 2 months to resolve my issue. This was around the time that all of the exchanges were receiving insane amounts of traffic though. They eventually resolved my issue.
