It doesn't deliberately say Bitcoin ATMs but does it exclude them?

A lot are asking about the bitcoin atms in philly. While there is no exact location for bitcoin atms there are 2 Temple students in our bitcoin meet up group who have atm machines that they bring with them around the city. Furthermore With the current ruling that "government" views bitcoins as personal property, bitcoin is included in a machine that allows you to purchase personal property.

Welcome to public, or "prison" schooling. Definitely alert your parents, alert the press, make the school as uncomfortable as possible and they will budge.

And your first mistake was giving the piece of paper to the principle. Never willingly forfeit anything to the warden of your prison school. Let them show what authoritarians they are and make them take it from you by force. (this is where a cell phone camera comes in handy)
