a willingness to average all the way down regardless of price. setup auto buys at set time intervals. be willing to wait at least 1 year before considering to sell. 5 years or more is better.

Brilliantly simple explanation.

Not sure if anyone read the terms of service, but i notice well before signing up for such a service that they have words that say things. They just literally post [this]( on their website for all to see. I'm not sure about anyone else, but Blockfi clearly laying out their [business model]( and the risks associated, helps me trust them. This is what social engineering looks like because now i'm spending my precious time defending a company I have no affiliation with. Also, i did get a notice that their rates were changing. 6.2% is damn good but you don't send all your bits, spread out the risk. Anyway, I was thinking maybe if the community makes a big enough stink about these bullshit concern troll posts,   people will read words and say things.

If this is real, welcome to the [position of fuck you](
Pay your debts, maybe buy some time off. Stay healthy.
Never sell them all and you will have an "everlasting gobstopper" if the stock to flow model plays out.
Also, hold em for at least a year and pay long term capital gains tax, but I'm not sure how that works for inheritance.
Also only **fiduciary advisors** are legally and ethically required to put your best interest before their own.

No where else so far. Blockfi is it. These lending and interest products are too new to put everything in, even if spread out between different platforms. For example Ledn.io came out with a "B2X" thing that looks suspicious, but that might just be my lack of understanding.

I like to imagine too, that i can someday acquire some real wealth, with bitcoin to spare.

Augmented reality zap wallet, thrown down some qr codes, instant bitcoin atm and payment kiosk.
Who going to build the self driving cars that earn crypto as a taxi to pay for its own fuel and repairs and buys you hamburgers?

I have run nodes on Pi's, old laptops with ubuntu, old desktops with windows. Now my nodes run on a windows VM hosted on my own server.
Yes, windows sucks, but I am most familiar with it.

looks pretty straight forward, then you just port forward 8333 to your static ip'd vm and you are set.
you are on your own with lightning.
I run a bitcoin and litecoin, lottery mining, bisq, maybe lightning windows node.

When i can buy enough time, meaning when i can pay myself equal or more than my day job's rate to do whatever I want with my time. Time i can then reallocate to learning new skills, investing in myself and my family.
I think 3 years plus extra coin left to then re evaluate the progress of the time investment and go from there.
