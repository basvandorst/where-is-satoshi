Hello Prince
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:30:31
Eventually there will be so many of them that the payout will get smaller and smaller. So in the long run it pays more to sell thousands of them as the price of bitcoin continues to rise so there will be more buyers.

I'd imagine you get it next year and the price will be super high so it will still be worth it.

Only thing that worries me is there are bitcoin millionaires looking to take out all their money and get it all without paying taxes and not end up in jail. Once a few figure out how to do it more will follow till they are not bitcoin millionaires due to the price drop and then we're all fucked.

Here is the bitcoinstore address for the period ending March 31. They still have almost all the money in bitcoins still. So someone is paying in cash and keeping the bitcoins. 
Does anyone have the address for the current period?

The bitcoins will show up and you can send them from coinbase to your blockchain wallet. It'll take around 10 minutes or less. They are great. I've bought like 90 bitcoins from them and sold 90 bitcoins through them. I gotta stop selling on these corrections. I'm out thousands of dollars now. But coinbase has been great. No problems and I'll continue to use them. I just hope they fix their out of bitcoin problem. I'll probably be buying $5,000 worth of bitcoins through them again and get the exchange rate price next week.
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:05:47
The only way it will fail is if people disregard the point of bitcoins (which is to use them to purchase things, not cash out for USD to purchase things). Many people have $1,000,000+ in bitcoins just sitting there when it was only thousands just a couple months ago. Maybe they are trying to figure out a way to cash out without being caught and the market crashes.

I dropped $4,000 and almost doubled it. At this rate I almost want to use my credit card to buy another 50. Wait for the price to go up over 1-2 months and then sell enough bitcoins to pay off credit card and end up with 20-30 more coins.

I don't get my coins from coinbase till Wednesday and I need the price to be around $125 to break even. Odds are against me. I should have never panic bought back in.

I don't want to cancel but I can't find the cancel button (and I looked). Where is it hiding?

People are working on ways for us to trade bitcoins where a DDoS isn't possible. Coding, testing, going live takes time. 
@_date: 2013-03-14 07:25:54
40 bitcoins. Bought some at $30 and some at $40. What I should have done was used the bitcoins to buy litecoins when they were 7 cents and then sell the litecoins at 70 cents and buy bitcoins. I would have 380 bitcoins right now if I did that. Missed the chance though :( 380 times $100 (if bitcoin price goes that high in a few months) = $38,000. That would have been a nice Christmas gift. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:37:45
In 3 days someone jacked the price straight up. Then used a bunch of accounts to spam small sales that lagged the exchange. Then DDos a bunch of bitcoin web sites. People that could get on started selling. When it reached $105 the people behind it started buying or someone did all the way to $180. Then it started again and then everything just went down. They DDoS finally let up long enough for things to start and it dropped to $55. The DDoS is ongoing and someone or people just bought the price up almost $80 to $130 and now some people are cashing out and brought the price to $100. Now there is another DDoS and we are waiting for that before people start trading again. I'm guessing a price drop this weekend and hopefully a recovery next week.

I have 89% of my money in bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 05:49:17
I honestly may have missed a chance at basically never working ever again. I have a bunch of bitcoins. I should have bought litecoins at 7 cents. Slowly sold them back into bitcoins. Then I would have over 1,000 bitcoins. If that was all USD I would have been able to live without working for at least 5 years. Now I keep all that money in bitcoins and hope the price goes up for the rest of my life. I would try to spend $25,000 a year only. I would rent out a room in someones house. Pay cash for rent. Cash for food. Have a cheap car. Just live off bitcoins for the rest of my long life. Since I missed the litecoin boat I need to figure out another way to acquire a ton of bitcoins with no money. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:32:00
Damn DDoS. I want the price to go up and stay up. That way we can buy stuff we couldn't afford yesterday.
@_date: 2013-03-20 13:11:28

Yeah coinbase now takes your money and in 5 days tells you how many bitcoins you get. I put in an order for 4 bitcoins and got 2.6. Lulz should have went somewhere else and I would have $200+ and another bitcoin.

Yeah, expect the typical bubble where it'll go up and stay up for a bit before some fools take the market down the rest of the way. Short term like till the middle of next week might be OK. Highly risky though. There will be new money coming in and I'm sure this person / group wants everyone to get one last chance to buy in before they cash out for good and take a year long vacation with their winnings.
@_date: 2013-03-14 19:51:37
You could do that. It's only $100-$140 if litecoin crashes. I would try to buy in around 50 cents as it looks to be bouncing around 50 cents to 60 cents last couple days. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 04:51:36
Let me tell you a story. 
A young man, 18 years old, gets picked up in a convertible. We speed past a cop and take the next exit and don't get caught. We end up at the casino. My first time and I had a blast. 
That man worked a lot and had $10,000+ saved up. He saved up a little bit more and needed a new car. His parents went half in on the car and this man had a new car and $8,000. In college, new car, friends to impress and a lot of money with little expenses this man drinks and gambles. 
He lost all his savings. He was buying $100 of alcohol at a time. Spent every pay check at the casino. Maxed out his credit card at the casino (thousands of dollars). There were times he would go to a fast food joint and the credit card wouldn't work and I had no money in my checking account.
This man moved out with no savings, in debt and his parents had to pay for a truck to move all his stuff.
That man worked hard and got out of debt and has put all his money into bitcoins. So far it has worked out but it is another gamble. At first it didn't seem like much but now every dollar it goes up he makes about as much as he does at work in a shift. 
If I never gambled I could have over $100,000 in bitcoins right now and almost retired (assuming bitcoin price keeps going up). 
Everyone tells you to save. That's because you never know when an investment of a lifetime will come. 
If someone has $15,000 right now they should buy around 100 bitcoins. Every dollar increase you are up another $100. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:04:27
I did some googling and it looks like people don't trust the site 
Is this trustworthy? How do I know the private keys aren't secretly stored on the server?
You can't.  I wouldn't have assumed it was meant to secure your 25000 BTC long-term, it's not even using HTTPS.  Looks more like proof of concept to me.
That was from 2011 too. Probably some scammer still catching people today using it and jacking their coins.
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:51:02
No one knows. We are waiting for a blog post.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:15:55

@_date: 2013-04-13 03:34:36
No one really knows what they do. Their bitcoins from the first 3 months are still in their bitcoin address. They went from over a million to under $500,000. Looks like they moved some now. 
So someone is probably paying in USD and then keeping the bitcoins but they never cashed out with a high price. So who knows.
@_date: 2013-06-20 01:18:38
I wish I did. The price was $30 and I bought 48 bitcoins. I could have bought 250 bitcoins but that would have been all of my money. 
If I did buy 250 bitcoins I could have cashed out at $40,000
I could have used that $40,000 to buy back in after it crashed down to $50
I could have then waited for the price to go back up and sold for over $100,000.
$7500 to $100,000 in only a few weeks. 
I wish I did that.

@_date: 2013-04-08 18:37:50
The price is around $30. I put all my savings into bitcoins. Don't have many bitcoins. I have a credit card I have paid off. I could buy 200 bitcoins with it. Never pulled the trigger. $75 comes and I could buy 100 bitcoins. Never do. Now I'm kicking myself because I could have around $40,000 right now.
@_date: 2013-04-06 18:51:57
I blame the anti-bitcoin people.
@_date: 2013-05-06 08:34:06
It is hard pulling the trigger when the price goes $150 to $79. I guess you just have to know the price has to go back up eventually. I was watching the chart when it hit $90 and I was thinking about buying but then thought what if it goes down. Instead it goes up $32 and I never bought in so I missed out on $600 or so. Arg!!
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:08:59
All it takes is 2 people to put a million dollars into bitcoin and the price goes up $30. Over the last 3 days I would say 6 different people put in a million. There could be more and the price will be over $300, $400 if rich people keep putting money into bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-07 11:05:23
$150 is a large buy wall. Meaning someone with a lot of money or a group of people will need to buy thousands of coins that are being offered in order to get over the $150 mark and onto $151. 
If someone just wants to cash out thousands of bitcoins then the other line shows how many bitcoins they would need to cash out in order to get to a certain price.

Classic pump. Get ready for more of the same this week. Buy now for a better tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:53:55
Litecoin is basically trying to piggyback on bitcoin by asking people that accept bitcoin to accept litecoin. Basically people are trying to pump litecoin up so the early adopters can sell their litecoins for bitcoins and profit even more and then retire before they even move out of their parents house. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:15:30
Bunch of coinbase haters here but that's all I've been using and right now if I had the money I could buy $6600 worth of bitcoins depending on the price of bitcoins next week when my transfer goes through. It is a 1% fee. If you wanted bitcoins same day check out bitcopia.com or bitfloor.com and deposit money into an account at Wells Fargo or Bank of America. With coinbase you will only be able to buy 10 I think at first unless they changed it. I would sign up ASAP and deposit some money in a bank to get some bitcoins right away.
I was around when the post about the $30k. That person probably has over 1,000 bitcoins. Honestly in 2 years he'll have around a million if bitcoins go mainstream. As the years go by I'm guessing millions and millions. I'm kicking myself for not doing all I could to acquire the most bitcoins I could. If I have 1,000 and the price keeps going up I could get by not working for the rest of my life. I would have to live cheap at first but once the price is close to $1,000 I could spend more. 
Good luck and lets hope bitcoins keep going up.
@_date: 2013-04-07 05:47:53

@_date: 2013-04-08 03:22:53
Nice dude. I was never told to invest in bitcoin so instead I bought hundreds and just spent them till it was $30 and it hit me to start saving. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 22:42:39
Buy 14 coins and let them sit. Once the price hits $100,000 a bitcoin (probably year 2020) you will have $140,000 off that $1,000 you invested. If the price crashes then you are out $1,000. 
Note: It could end up anywhere from under $1,000 to over $1,000. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 07:30:06
I wouldn't be caught holding litecoin till there is ways to spend it. I don't want people telling me these half assed dead sites that accept litecoins either. There is no market just hype from people trying to sell their litecoins to buy more bitcoins.

I bought 50 bitcoins at $123 and the price tanked to $50. They didn't cancel me due to high risk :( but the price recovered so I'm not out any money.
I'm guessing coinbase ran out of bitcoins or wanted to give the bitcoins to people who paid more.
In the end it's business as usual at coinbase.
@_date: 2013-03-21 00:43:42
I was addicted to the casino and blew my life savings. Then I recently found out about bitcoins and put all my money I had in there and now have 40 coins. I have a couple dollars in my bank account till payday and I'll buy some more coins. Probably 5. I'm hoping bitcoins goes way up and I can actually do stuff other then work my low paying job (I'm not smart). If bitcoins fail I'll be living pay check to pay check.
@_date: 2013-05-06 08:54:36
If you have 2 million in mtgox you can put in a request to buy x amount of bitcoins at a certain price. So this person wanted 15,000 bitcoins at $110. No one sold that many bitcoins though and eventually the person canceled their order and the buy wall went away. 
The same thing happens with people who have 15,000 bitcoins they want to sell. They put 15,000 bitcoins up at $125 so usually people sell knowing that it would be pretty hard to buy all 15,000 bitcoins to get over $125 so then the price goes down. 
It is all mind games to move the price up and down with large walls.

Someone created a site that lets you play it with play money. I doubt I'll be able to find it but in the end you always lose your money. A run of bad luck (like 9 loses in a row) will empty your pockets if betting 50%. Better any other way will just take a really long time to empty your account. I've tried the casino many times. I'm down $30,000+ and I'm going to be down over a thousand gambling on bitcoins. I make $14 / hour and live on my own too. It'd be nice to have almost $40,000 right now if not more if I never gambled.

At times it will allow you to deposit an amount of money you choose and after it clears in a few days they will take the amount you sent divided by the current market price. So in 4-6 days the price may go up but at least you know you will get some bitcoins and this is the easiest way.

I'm trying to buy 50 bitcoins with a locked in price. Proving impossible. If I go the other way I will probably get less bitcoins as the price will rise. I guess I'll just have to take that chance. Maybe it'll go down in price on the day I get my bitcoins priced. Today would have been perfect.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:08:10
High risk because they didn't have enough bitcoins. You'll get your money back in 2-3 bank days. Monday maybe, maybe not. I would say Tuesday for sure if they got the refund in early today. Otherwise Wednesday. Just gotta wait for that.
Highly unlikely they will cancel your order. Are you locked in at a price or not? Go to buy / sell part of the site and click on history. Is there a cancel button? If not you just gotta wait.

Litecoins were 7 cents 2 weeks ago. Today 65 cents. If one bought $1,000 worth of litecoins 2 weeks ago they would have $9,100 today. The question is whether the price stays the same / goes up / goes down.
