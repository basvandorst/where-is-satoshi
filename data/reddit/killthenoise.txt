Wow, like clockwork this happened.

Same, mine went thru.

I’m here and I assure you it does not feel empty. It feels full. And hot.
@_date: 2018-05-15 19:01:05
Oh, yeah. It’s pretty shit.

Dude. At this point you need marriage advice. The money isn’t coming back. Accept it. I did the same shit earlier this summer except I lost $70k. It’ll pass. $25k can be made up in six months with some tight budgets and overtime. You’ll be fine. Tell your wife you’ll take a job on the side to make it up quicker if you have to. 
Accept it. Make a plan. And move on. 
And do not start trading again.

Don't think so. There's plenty of places to easily buy BTC in Australia. They can barely answer support tickets let alone scale to a different country. 
cointree.com.au is a good one.

You should reconsider, there's quite a bit of floor left to lose.

Depends on the timeline. Hong Kong will still be online, although not sure the hashing power there.
If it becomes an emergency there may have to be a hardfork to adjust. There'll definitely be bloodshed but it'll be short lived.

Yeah the problem with that theory is that, hypothetically, if we zoom out in ten years, that big jump could look like a fucking bump in the road compared to possible growth. Blockchain has seen almost zero actual consumer use, and I'd be willing to bet that only about 1 in 5 people you ask on the street know what cryptocurrency is and about 1 in 20 actually knows how it works, and 1 in 100 actually own some. Assuming this chart can even apply to a phenomenon like a new currency system...
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:10:13
I agree.

Fundamentals are already priced into the value of bitcoin.

READ THE OTHER 25 THREADS THAT COVER THIS?!

Sounds good.

They don't have to understand all of those things, just like any Joe Schmoe smartphone user doesn't have to understand computer engineering, circuitry, and the like. 
This isn't some sort of replacement currency. The stability is a direct product of the amount of people that use it and the amount of vendors that accept it.
