Thanks for your help so far. I appreciate people giving me info.
I have since removed my back-ups from Dropbox. I have created new back-ups and will encrypt them before uploading them again.
Nobody else has access to my Dropbox, or indeed the computer or folders. Dropbox is secured with Two-Step Verification.
I also don't store passwords in emails (I actually get quite annoyed when websites email me and confirm I have changed my password, and then display it clearly in the email!).
I've checked my Security in Dropbox, and it displays the all the Sessions and Devices used to connect to Dropbox. There is nothing in these lists that is out of the ordinary. It shows the last time I logged in on my computer and what browser I used. There isn't anything obvious in there that shows someone else logged in to Dropbox.

My back-ups are created and stored in a folder on my computer. Dropbox copies the contents of this folder and stores it in the Cloud. Therefore, the contents of that folder are not encrypted.

Yes, it is encrypted and backed up regularly. I also withdraw the funds daily so that there isn't a lot in there. It was only about $20 worth, but I'm still surprised they're gone.

Thanks for the info. I've done as you suggested, but there are no addresses in that list.
When I type listunspent and press return, it simply replies with:
So I'm guessing from this it isn't a Change Address.

No, I don't use TrueCrypt on back-ups as it's an automatic folder. I dump the back-up on the computer, and Dropbox duplicates it into the Cloud.
Is there a suggestion that Dropbox is insecure?

12 characters, numbers letters, symbols

I've never heard of Change Addresses, and that post has completely baffled me as to, if it is a Change Address function, how I therefore recover the amount.

Yea, I've stopped using Dropbox. I use sync.com now which gives 5GB free encrypted storage. Same as Dropbox, just encrypted. I also don't store backups or sensitive info in the cloud anymore. It's backed up on-site via HDD and USB sticks.
I've also made new accounts with the sites, using new username and passwords, as well as using new bitcoin addresses for everything. Unfortunately I "locked" my payment address within Slushs Pool, so I can't even change the address payout, but with a new account and new address I can set it up. Just means I have just under the minimum 0.01 threshold payment that's lost. On top of the 0.0451 that was taken in the first place.

The funds were transferred to:
I'm using Mac OSX 10.9.2 (13C64).
I back-up my wallet every time I made a transaction. It is stored in the Cloud via a backup folder to Dropbox.
I've never shared the same wallet between two instances of Bitcoin-Qt.
I've never used a paper wallet.

The address to which my funds were transferred to was this:
I allocated a name to any address I send to, so it's easier to keep track of what's going where. This is an unknown and unlabelled address on my system.
