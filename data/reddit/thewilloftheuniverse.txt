It CANNOT change the law. 
if you want to transfer your money from existing on the ledger of a bank to existing on the ledger of bitcoin, that number on the ledger of the bank has to go somewhere, staying on that ledger system. 
In order for Coinbase to accept an exchange from my ledger entry at Bank A in order to then give me some bitcoin, they have to comply with all the rules about shuffling and trading bank ledger entries. 
That's where most of the money in the world exists, on the Bank's collection of private ledgers. If you want to use your money in that private ledger to get some entry on a separate ledger system, no matter how innovative and amazing that separate ledger system is, you've got to follow the rules with the first ledger system while using it.

Bitcoin is fiat, except the one declaring "it is" is a decentralized computer program, not a state. 
Which is, of course what makes it so amazing and laudable.

I remember my first 1kb hard drive. It was the size of a department store.

I don't think it would have lowered his integrity to accept money to choose the topic he'd make a video about. It would lower his integrity if he accepted money to influence what he said about the topic in the video.

Banks would argue that that is precisely why bankruptcy in general is immoral and shouldn't be allowed. 
I'm asking about what's legal. The government does not get to tell me what's moral, and i hope you don't find this offensive, but neither do you. I don't get to tell you either. Let's pretend I get my morality on debt from the Bible, which never gave anything except advice to borrowers, and gave copious commandments to lenders, requiring them to forgive debt to their own loss.

40k. I have no intention of paying them off. They are unfairly abusive, and I refuse to submit to such abuse, no matter how legal it is. 
I do not care about how the bankruptcy will hurt my credit score. I'm not looking for advice on how to pay my loans. i'm looking for advice on how to declare bankruptcy on a type of debt that has been immorally made immune to bankruptcy.

I'm not going to lie about how much money I have in bitcoins. I own't have any at all when I do it. This is simply "laundering" because someone told me that they won't let you just pay off the student loan debt with credit card debt and declare bankruptcy on the credit card debt. 
@_date: 2013-07-20 07:15:15
Nah, that's not right.

i guess i don't understand what I'm trying to do.
@_date: 2013-07-20 07:27:25
I guess so. I probably need to ask this sort of question to @_date: 2013-07-20 07:40:09
They will go pretty far for this, as far as requiring employers to dock your pay.

I'm not planning on earning money. I'm planning on losing money and declaring bankruptcy on my debt. can't declare bankruptcy on student debt, and I've been told that you can't just pay it off with credit cards and then declare bakruptcy on that. So I'm adding a (... laundering?) layer. 
@_date: 2013-07-20 07:39:34
yeah, totally theoretical. 
@_date: 2013-07-20 07:27:00
Yes, I know.
