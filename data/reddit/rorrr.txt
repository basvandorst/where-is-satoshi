So if you want your coins to be really really safe, use bank's services. Print out a paper wallet, store it in a safe deposit box. It's like $15-25/year.
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:03:33
Ok, how do you "attack" one of these coins, specifically? I'm not saying you're wrong, it's just I hear this for the first time, it sounds really strange.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:17:51
Well yes. But that's one thing banks are actually good at - physical security. Vaults, storage boxes.

Miners have no reason to fuck with the coin they are mining.  A pool of miners is not some monolith that decides "oh, let's include this weird transaction from one of the original Satoshi's addresses to my own".
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:28:37
This article is a misconception, because it forgot to account that most miners own both BTC and BCH. So attacking the smaller coin is pointless. Not only it will get discovered, hard-forked, and reverted, it will waste 15% of their own holdings. There's literally no upside in an attack.
But more importantly, it will destroy the mining pool that does the attack, and all the miners who unwillingly participated will move to other pools, or form their own.

Only 10% of gold is currently used industrially now. The rest is just vanity crap and hoarding by the governments and the banks.
Industrial use of diamonds is even less than that 
1) 80% of mined diamonds are not gemstone quality and are used industrially
2) Most tools use diamond dust (grit), which is useless for jewelry. 
3) The larger industrial diamonds are generally synthetic, because they are much more pure and are cheaper too. 90% of grinding grit is made of synthetic diamonds.
@_date: 2014-07-04 12:11:13

You're confused. This only calculates the overall average inflation. 
Particular products can have much higher (or much lower inflation).
Gasoline, for instance, is 3.17 times more expensive than in the base years (1982-84). Which is [about right](
@_date: 2014-06-06 16:43:48

The purpose of a turing complete language is to perform arbitrary code that theoretically allows unlimited complexity.
You don't get Ethereum, it's not a currency, it's a platform that would allow the development of contracts, distributed exchanges, colored coins, and much more. 
And since you have to pay for every cycle of execution, it's impossible to bring it into and infinite loop.
For somebody with 34 years of experience you are surprisingly dumb. Your mind got old and stuck in the old paradigms.

I hope at least one of them succeeds.

Mining is self-correcting. If almost nobody mines, it becomes too easy and profitable, more people move in and start mining.

OK, let's try the multisig escrow then (unless you trust me, then I will send you the money after the package arrives).
Based on this:
    1) Create a multisig address which requires signatures from both 
       the buyer and seller.
    2) The buyer sends funds to this address.
    3) Seller ships the product.
    4a) When the product arrives, the buyer and the seller sign a  
        transaction sending the funds from the multisig address to the seller.
    4b) If the order is cancelled amicably, the buyer and seller sign a 
        transaction sending the funds from the multisig address to the buyer.
I guess we can use Armory

First of all, it's you who is making the claim it's "for consumer protection" because it's "risky", and you can't even answer why they didn't ban other super-risky investments that have been around for decades.
There are many possible reasons they are banning bitcoin derivatives - the most obvious is that it gives an easy access to bitcoin to all kinds of regular people who are used to the traditional securities. Like buying a bitcoin fund for your IRA/401k (or whatever equivalent they have in Belgium).
That, in turn, promotes and propagates the adoption of Bitcoin.
And that's the thing the governments are afraid the most - they can't control Bitcoin, which is (probably) going to displace all kinds of national currencies and put them out of business of conning people through controlled inflation ([QE]( is the euphemism they chose haha).
Make no mistake, all this crap under the guise of "consumer protection" is complete nonsense - there are all kinds of high-risk investments that are completely legal. Lotteries, casinos, penny stocks, startups, MLM schemes, etc.

So? Now that particular store knows bitcoin address XYZ ordered something to address ABC.
If I'm paranoid, I can generate a hundred addresses and randomly move money between them, and then spend them randomly from that random pool, and never use the used addresses again.
All you will see on the blockchain is money moving around between addresses. You won't even know at which point I actually bought something. 
Even if you somehow get that store's data (good luck with that), you will get an association between one of my random wallets and a physical address. And if I'm paranoid, I will order to a PO Box. Good luck figuring anything from that.
And if I'm extra paranoid, I can ship to an anonymizing proxy company, and they will forward it to me. There are tons of them.


No, thousands of people order shit with bitcoin every day. How many of them can you identify? I'd confidently say - zero, because you can't even tell that somebody bought something, instead of sending money to their friend, for instance.

No. Mining is self-correcting. If the difficulty grows too much, mining becomes too expensive, people stop mining, difficulty drops, mining becomes affordable.
You actually don't know if any of these cloudhashing companies do any mining and have any hardware at all. Their contracts are so bad, they can simply buy coins with your money and then feed a portion of these coins back to you, pretending they are mining.

Even if it's down to a billion combinations, there's still a problem of verifying what the private key opens. Even a simple key-&gt;address generation is computationally intensive. 
But then you need to check the balance also, and that means you have to have the whole blockchain parsed and in a database of some sort, since no API would let you hit it a billion times.

Or if you want to make an app for a specific platform, you have to deal with their requirements, like ObjectiveC/Swift for iOS or Java for Android.

How the hell do you convince all your miners to collude and do a doublespend, risking the price of bitcoin? It makes zero sense.
And even if they can do a doublespend, can you come up with a realistic doublespend scenario in which they actually make more money than it would cost them, and would allow to get away with it? May I remind you, fraud is still a crime.

What choice would they have? If the wages fall everywhere (in Bitcoins), they won't just quit their job just because.
Many people experience deflationary nature of certain markets constantly - pretty much all electronics, computers, smartphones - they all lose value very quickly over time, and yet they are some of the best selling things out there. Think of it from the perspective of a seller - they buy, let's say, 10,000 smartphones for their inventory. Now they got themselves in the deflationary hole, and they must sell these phones, or start losing money in half a year. Do they quit their jobs in half a year? No. They buy 10,000 next gen phones.

In order to beat them you really have to monitor thousands of nodes and basically front-run them. It's not cheap if you're paying for the servers, since you have to poll thousands of nodes a few times per second (and/or have thousands of custom nodes, geographically separated).

You don't generate addresses. All addresses exist simultaneously, just like numbers (addresses are just very large numbers). When you create a wallet, you generate a private key that gives you access to an address.

Your biggest error is in not understanding how bitcoin price forms.
You don't need a billion dollars to increase bitcoin's market cap (which is the measure of the price) by a billion dollars. Not even close, you need much less.
Look at Bitstamp's market depth, for instance:
$8.5M USD buy order would shift the price to $1000/BTC. Thus increasing the market cap by 5 billion dollars!
That's why even relatively small investments or selloffs cause wild price changes.
The liquidity is low.
And that's why the market cap (or the price) is a stupid metric.

Your QR scanner can't generate a private key/address pair where the address is just a couple characters off, that's computationally impossible. So it can't steal your money.
The worst it can do is generate an incorrect valid address, but then it has to deliberately calculate the correct checksum for it instead of getting it from the QR code.

	&lt;MagicalTux&gt; well, two actually
	&lt;MagicalTux&gt; one will get the 424k, the other one will get the change
	&lt;go1dfish&gt; ok, yeah all transactions get split that way as I understand it
	&lt;MagicalTux&gt; ready guys? Don't come after me claiming we have no coins after that
	&lt;MagicalTux&gt; hopefully I'll be able to work without getting too much disturbed after that~
	&lt;go1dfish&gt; yeah, ready
	&lt;nanotube&gt; MagicalTux: wasn't your last tx 432K btc? lost 8k?
	&lt;geist_&gt; no
	&lt;geist_&gt; thats just the amount someone suggested
	&lt;geist_&gt; (the 424242)
	&lt;nanotube&gt; ah

	&lt;go1dfish&gt; shit I just ruined the economy
	&lt;mabus&gt; what does this help
	&lt;geist_&gt; theres a lot of people crying wolf saying gox doesnt have their btc anymore
	&lt;wumpus&gt; don't send them to the bitcoin eater please :)
	&lt;go1dfish&gt; mabus: tux is shuffling large numbers of bitcoins to show they are still under his control

Why do you need a mixer service? It's trivial to generate thousands of new private keys. Send the money to some of them randomly. Then randomly shuffle the money between them and the fresh ones. 
From the outsider's perspective you spent your money and it went to other wallets and and then some other ones, and so on.
Which is also true if you simply spend your money. They have no idea who you're sending the money to.

First of all, your assumptions are all messed up. You start with USD in both cases, and you apply exchange a specific fees to EVERY purchase with BTC.  Other exchanges have lower fees. I got most of my BTC for a 0.24% fee on bitstamp.
Also many merchants give discounts for buying in BTC.
If you want to see a huge difference, try transferring a large sum of money to a different country, different currency.

Yes, banks are safer than the bitcoin exchanges. How is that an argument against bitcoin? Exchanges serve a different purpose. Cold storage wallets are safer than any bank in the world.
Why would somebody rational invest in bitcoin? Many reasons. For instance if their country's currency is consistently losing value, year after year. That's pretty much every fiat currency in the world in the last 100 years. Some lose more, like the Zimbabwean dollar, some lose less, like the US dollar.
Another reason is if you don't want to be under the control of the government or the banking system. Look at Argentina or China with their insane reactionary monetary policies. 
Another reason - low transaction fees.
There are many others if you are interested in learning, though I doubt that's the case.

You can monitor the network for a doublespend attempt. They don't have much time to submit a competing transaction, and most nodes will not accept a doublespend anyway.

If bitcoin were cheap/easy to crush, it would've have happened many times already, considering there are whole governments that dislike it.
There's not a single realistic scenario that completely breaks bitcoin.

Bitstamp and other exchanges books combined do almost fully represent the actual fiat-BTC market. There are off the books deals of course too.
I agree that the shift in price would probably be short lived, but it doesn't mean it didn't happen or it's meaningless. And you prove it right in the next paragraph by saying that the price is an important metric.


And that's all there's to it. It's a pretty meaningless metric. It doesn't give you the total valuation, even if you call it so. 
You can't sell your Y coins at price $X, that's a fact. You can't even sell 1% of them without driving the price to zero.

Your example is completely made up, you even added some "forex fees", which have nothing to do with this discussion. And Bitstamp doesn't have a 0.1% deposit fee (the last time I checked).
Bitstamp actually has THE BEST EUR&lt;--&gt;USD conversion rate that you can find. When my bank wanted to charge me $30 + 3% on the conversion rate, I simply wired my USD to Bitstamp and withdrew it as EUR.
Bitstamp's currency spread is 0.82% (which means you're paying just 0.41% more than the spot price):
Compare it to my bank's spread of 6% or PayPal's 2.5% conversion fee plus whatever their shitty rate is (couldn't find it).

3) NSA has backdoors in almost everything - hardware, software, security products, etc. A rogue employee can steal your coins.
4) Somebody targeting certain OS'es with a previously unknown remote exploit, and simply infecting everything through a scanner.

The monetary inflation is baked in, everyone knows exactly how much it is and how much it will fall in the future. If you don't count the lost coins, it's under 11%.
So if Bitcoin adoption is slower than 11% per year, we might see some price inflation. Looking at the graphs, the adoption surpasses 11% by a lot. So I don't see that as a problem.

If you compare an idle CPU + idle GPU (which is what your PC is with normal use) with them under full load (which is what mining does), you will get around 200-400 watts. That's 144-288 Kwh per month. So it will cost you cost you around $17-34/month in the US, or $59-118/month in Denmark.

The problem is you only list every negative bit, and no positive, which clearly shows you're a troll.
Let's dismantle your dumb arguments.
1) Buying anything anonymously over the internet, like a VPN or hosting, is only available via bitcoin. It's extremely important for people living in totalitarian countries.
2) Is not an argument, but is a question followed by a logical fallacy called [argument from incredulity](
3) Two problems.
   A) I myself have transferred a large sum of money USD -&gt; EUR using Bitcoin as an intermediary. It was way cheaper than a wire + conversion transfer. It was way way way cheaper than WesternUnion. I'm not familiar with the Australian situation, maybe there's indeed some fee issue. If you are willing to deal with LocalBitcoins, you can actually make money in the process.
   B) The comparison isn't fair, since it assumes a very specific currency transfer. If you get paid in Bitcoin and wan to transfer Bitcoin, Bitcoin wins by a factor of hundred+.
4) Is completely nonsensical. Historically Bitcoin beats every stock, ETF, bond, gold bar, real estate as a store of value, every single year. It actually increases in value, because it's deflationary by design. Bitcoins get lost. New people are born. Global population grows.

You can't. There are always new viruses that antiviruses aren't aware of.
However you can try and run multiple antiviruses and rootkit scanners.
If you're on Windows, I'd try AVG, MSE, GMER, Prevx Free - anything free you can find.
But more importantly, I'd not do anything with bitcoins on that OS ever. I'd have a clean Linux setup, never go to any random websites on it, have all the bitcoin wallet stuff under root, etc.

Bitcoin is nearly anonymous. Exchanges do know who bought what, and can trace the money to a certain degree. But if somebody moved coins to a brand new wallet, nobody can be sure who controls that wallet.

Because that's how many bitcoins are for sale. I gave you the link.
You're assuming that ALL bitcoins are for sale, when in reality only 13.6K bitcoins are (on Bitstamp). That's 0.1% of all available coins, and that 0.1% greatly affects the price of the rest 99.9%, which are elsewhere and generally don't participate in the trading market. Ok, maybe there's another 0.1% on Bitfinex and 0.05% on BTC-E, it's still a tiny fraction.


You don't understand how it works. I'm not trying to insult you, but you really don't. Here's a simple explanation:
"Current price" doesn't mean you can buy as many coins/stocks as you want at that price. "Current price" is just the price of the last trade. Look at the market depth, I gave you the link. It tells you how many of bitcoins you can buy and at what price. 
Same with stocks, except most big stocks have a lot of liquidity, and it's much harder to move the price even with large orders.


Nope. Every time you accept the lowest seller's price, you move the price up (or remain constant if you didn't buy enough and they still have more coins for sale at that price).

They will. They have no reason to bid over the market rate. They can slowly get 3000 btc from various exchanges and not cause much slippage.
3000 BTC is just $1.683 million, which is tiny. Bitstamp's volume alone is in the $15 million/day range. Bitfinex - a bit more.
Looking at the market depth of Bitstamp, a 3000 BTC buy order would move the price to $607. If you spread these buys over a bunch of exchanges, noone will even notice.

Hard fork assumes that you now have two separate codebases, one of them is not backwards-compatible.
So the users (or the miners) will have to pick one.
If you have a situation where neither of the branches has an overwhelming support, you now have two "bitcoins" which aren't the same, and they start going different paths, different sets of transactions, but they both call themselves "bitcoin".

The way I do it
1) Install brand new Linux. Never use it for anything but Bitcoin operations.
2) Get Keepass. Create a new encrypted storage with at least a million rounds of hashing. That will prevent any bruteforce attacks. Pick a password you can remember. It should be at least 12 characters long. 
3) Get wallet software of your preference.
4) Disconnect from the internet
5) Create a wallet (if extra-paranoid, create your own private key by throwing dice/coins).
6) Put your private key into KeePass. 
7) Save the keepass database in multiple places (disk, USB drives,  floppy), you can even email it to yourself and the people you trust. Make sure it's spread geographically, you don't want a random house fire to wipe all your backups.
8) Secure-wipe all the the private keys you've created. It can be as simple as overwriting a text file with some random garbage.
9) TEST PHASE - Send some small amount to your new address. Make sure you can recover that money.
10) Send the rest of your money 
11) You might want to store your Keepass password in a sealed envelope in a safety deposit box in case something happens to you, so your family can get 500 BTC.

Most of them are non-issues

2) Third-party storage security is pretty much a solved problem with multi-sig.
4) Scalability - most limits are artificial at the moment and/or are being worked on. The adoption curve is pretty smooth, we're not hitting any major bottlenecks yet.
  
5) Privacy. That one is completely made up. If you want to anonymize your coins, it's trivial. Create a hundred, a thousand addresses or more and send your money randomly between them. Or use mixing services.
   Unless exchanges are selling their customer data, there's no real way to identify who owns what in the first place.

Everything the russian government touches is corrupt to the core. This is just yet another scheme to move taxpayer's money into the pockets of the participants of the scheme. 
I think it's going to work like this: they order a bunch of outdated mining equipment that China doesn't want anymore (and Russia doesn't make any), they use taxpayer's money for that under a label of a big government IT development project. They will hook it up to some power plant where the owners of the plant get nothing, because they can't go against the government. They will mine what they can, inefficiently, until their equipment is so old, it doesn't mine anything. Then they transfer the mined coins into their own pockets and say "oops, we got hacked by the evil americans/ukrainians/etc".

A cell phone on a 4G connection could technically run a node, even if the blocks are 2MB. The total blockchain size is 127GB. We have smartphones with [256GB of storage space]( Next year there will be at least one phone with 512GB. 
Getting a server with such specs is trivial and affordable. 512GB lets you store 256,000 blocks, 2MB each. At 10 minute per block that's almost 5 years of completely full blocks.

First of all, you didn't answer the question.
To address your long rant, big blocks have been tested, and work even on current gen hardware, confirmation times won't be affected that much. If you think 1GB per 10 minutes is a lot in any way, you have zero clue about modern computing. We won't need 1GB blocks for a long time, and by then the advances in technology will make them cheap enough. 
BCH doesn't have RBF, so confirmation times for most transactions don't matter anyway, you can safely accept unconfirmed transactions for small-ish payments.
Fungibility hasn't been a problem, you just made it up.
Anything else?

Because they are thinking ahead, not just at their current profits. High fees mean your money can't be used as currency except for really large money transfers. Low fees means you can use it everywhere - game micropayments, tip bots, small donations, online shopping, online gambling. 
The miners understand this, the more people use your currency, the more valuable it is (demand/supply), so the potential growth is tremendous. But high fees make it impossible.

OMG, seriously, that's your answer after I pointed out that you use *n* inconsistently.

Hint: that n means different things in different algorithms. In sorting, its the number of elements being sorted. In graphs it could be the number of nodes, or the number of edges, etc.

No. That's not clear at all.


Yet BCH works just fine with its 8MB blocks. Looks like bitfury was wrong.
Most of what you wrote is wrong because you don't understand what "n" is in O(n) or O(n^2). You switch its meaning frivolously from one sentence to another. In one sentence it's the number of transactions in a block, in another it's the number of hashes you need for multisig transactions, and then you switch back to a linear example (*"let's take a basic one input, 2 output transaction"*), and you claim it it's O(n^2). You thought I wouldn't notice that deceit, but I did.
And then you make basic math errors, telling me to multiply by 4. Hint: that's not how you square a number.
And then nowhere you actually demonstrate that it's impossible to process 254.88MB of information in 10 minutes. It's a trivial amount of data for a modern CPU. Here, a previous-generation Xeon can do 225 MiB of SHA-256 checks *PER SECOND*.
So your assumptions are wrong by orders of magnitude.


Not with Bitcoin Cash. After the first transaction got broadcasted and got to most nodes, most (if not all) nodes will reject a double spend attempt.
So you have to send your second transaction seconds after the first, making it obvious that you're trying to doublespend.

What specifically? 
Basically any big software has bugs of various degrees of shittiness. When hackers find particularly bad ones, they can inject their own software (called virus / malware) into the website, which can affect the website users.


They know the username, that's all they need for a target, they don't have to know your real name/address/anything. If they have a zero-day exploit for the browser, then could theoretically target the user (or all the users, for instance), infect their PC, and then steal their coins, if the user's opsec is shitty.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:45:44

There's no direct correlation. Market cap is just the price of the last trade multiplied by the number of coins in circulation. Nobody really knows how much fiat money went into buying bitcoin.

I just explained it, it's no longer a currency, the fees are too high. Who wants to pay $1, $5, $15 in fees to pay for a $2 coffee? That's why so many projects dropped it, and started using BCH, Ethereum, Litecoin.
Remember the bitcoin tipbot? Why do you think people stopped using it?


That's what bitcoin core / blockstream decided, but they didn't plan well, and even refused to increase the block to 2MB to alleviate the pain while other solutions are being developed. Why? They never rationally explained, 2MB blocks are not a problem in any way.
It will take them a long time to develop working scalable solutions, they have to solve some real hard computer science problems, like distributed routing.
But even if they do develop their LN, how do you imagine it's going to work? Like I walk on a street, I want to buy a bagel for $1. Do I have to open a channel with the bagel shop, then fund it, then send the money? That's insane.

Same thing as if 1% of USD is dumped onto the Forex, or 1% of gold onto gold exchanges - the price goes to near zero. 
1% is a lot.
There are 16.5M bitcoins in circulation, valued at $65.5B. 1% of that is $655M. If you dump that amount of BTC onto all bitcoin exchanges, there's only one outcome - cheap bitcoins for a while.
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:43:25
That's not how mining works. If they collected their own fees back, it means they didn't collect the regular transaction fees during that time. Opportunity cost.

At 100-140 sat/byte that's some very expensive spam.

Ok, then it's much worse. The demand right now is roughly equalized with the amount mined, 1800BTC per day. When you dump millions of BTC on the market, you satisfy the demand for months. Granted, they will be cheaper, but still, it will take a while for the market to equalize again.

@_date: 2017-07-15 14:12:36
Way to blame the people who have no control over anything.
Bitcoin core did all this by refusing to increase the block size. Blocks got full, that's a fact. Transaction fees skyrocketed, that's a fact. Tons of transactions ended up in limbo for weeks, sometimes months, that's a fact. Bitcoin's primary function (a currency) got damaged, and so its reputation, so people are fleeing, the number of new transactions is dropping.
@_date: 2017-07-15 20:45:49


That is not true. The block size is the same.
You clearly don't understand the difference.

@_date: 2017-07-21 22:55:40
Except I, personally, don't care. It's not bitcoin. I want to send the money to person / service X. I don't want it to hang in the limbo of some third party network until it decides to clear.
Bitcoin is already complex enough that I, as a programmer, took a while to understand it. Segwit and Lightning Network seem like much more complex layers, which means they will be prone to non-obvious bugs, like the one that just hit one the big Ethereum contracts, resulting in $35M loss. I can't honestly trust my money to something I don't trust.

@_date: 2017-07-21 17:49:57
That was a very rough estimate, because it depends on the Segwit adoption (which I assume will be close to zero at the beginning).
With Segwit alone (without 2X) we will have full blocks right away, for a while, and if it has any actual real world use, we might see a bit of space to free up, but not much. I don't see 100% Segwit adoption happening any time soon.
@_date: 2017-07-15 20:06:55

@_date: 2017-07-21 20:39:38
That's not what we're talking about though. But let's assume that scenario, everyone gives each other non-broadcasted signed transactions. What does that solve? The overall network is still bandwidth-limited by the block size.
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:04:50
Drama has not subsided. Notice how the talk quickly shifted from Segwit2x (BIP 91) to Segwit alone (BIP 148). Classic bait and switch. Segwit buys the network a bit of time, until the blocks are full again. Within a year we will find ourselves in the same exact situation. Next time, if we let it happen, Ethereum will overtake us.
@_date: 2017-07-15 20:09:11
That's some weird straw man argument. BU solution is ideal. If you like SegWit, I don't think anybody would really mind, as long as the blocks are large to handle all the transactions in reasonable time.

A.k.a. not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:06:41
The blocks got full and stayed full (apart from a few exceptions) around Jan 30th. [Proof](
Bitcoin price: Jan 31 = $950, now = $2590.
Ethereum price: Jan 31 = $10.6, now = $372.
So Bitcoin grew by the factor of 2.72, while Ethereum grew by the factor of 35.

Don't be obtuse. Block increase is a separate proposal, and you know exactly what I meant. Yes, SegWit results in a mild block space increase, but it doesn't solve the problem of the increased number of on-the-chain transactions long term. Lightning Network is not bitcoin, it's just some off-the-chain layer that I personally don't want to use, and it is vaporware anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:55:36

They have tons of coins because they started early when difficulty was low. Most of them quit mining since then.
