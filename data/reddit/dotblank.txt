If buses and taxis took bitcoin, that would make 10% of the western unions' transactions obsolete.

I actually work as a western union agent. That fee is for the money in minutes services. There is a cheaper next day service. Generally people who send sub $50 immediately do not actually care about the cost. I've had customers on the phone with the receiver sending around 20 dollars so the person could get a taxi home.
This is normally used in emergency situations. I had a customer regularly send a remittance that I told about bitcoin, He seriously stayed for 30 mins asking questions on how it works.

depends on the bank, mine are free but my fathers' account cost's him $3/transfer

I seriously doubt anyone would complain, if anything I would get a commendation for customer service.

That was an incredibly positive article

It wasn't a security auditor, it was a financial auditor.

That can actually be fixed, you can encrypt the wallet.

Thanks man! I have been a long time viewer of your show but I mostly just lurk.
There is so much stuff to cover I wouldn't know where to start. The currency moves so quickly and events can occur in an instant.

Wow, you just might make me participate more on this reddit. I worry tips like these will attract a new level of karma farming.

I work as a cashier in my city and every once in awhile I'll get to mention bitcoin. Something is really changing recently. I have tons of friends asking me about mining and random customers idly talk about it.
Also our point of sale system could be super easily modified to accept bitcoin, its programmed in linux, has nfc support, and a huge screen that would be easy to scan. I wonder how much longer I'll have to wait before I'll see a pay in bitcoin option.

Well I think you still can. Just not likely.

Chris would make an excellent bitcoin podcast, the quality of their production is very high. They have been podcasting for some time.

Man, you eviscerated that article.
A pop could still occur, but when I look at the volume of buy orders and the recent mini pop, I think too many people will jump on it and buy. The twitchy people will loose their money. The demand for the coins is simply too high.

Huh, I guess not, but if you ever find yourself in Richmond VA, send me a message and I'll gladly buy you a beer.

They operate entirely in the virtual currency. Satoshi Dice will not be impacted.

Hmm I wish I had a tiny amount of bitcoins to test this site out. I already sold mine when they were just 40$
