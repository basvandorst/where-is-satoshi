I had no luck with the white BIP-39 words in the picture. I am not quiet sure what I defined as being white since some are questionable. I will share the data, I only tried mnemonic phrases based off the order they appeared in the whitepaper. 
If it came to any use feel free to send me a piece of that sweet internet money.. or if you have any other suggestions worth trying, lmk!

I know it's a little late, but you could have downloaded it on a stationary pc, which only takes 2-3 days iirc, and then copied it over. Also, are you using any extra power supply to your hdd? Probably not needed but just curious  
On another note, I spent some time yesterday trying to spin up a testnet node with the testnet on a usb stick. I did not realize how fucking slow the write speed was. An external HDD processes more blocks in a minute than a USB can do in an hour lol.   
For those who are interested in running a node, I recommend Stadicus Raspibolt guide:

I have two setups, one rpi 3 with a 3.5", which runs on external power. The other setup is rpi3 with a 2.5", but running only with a UASB cable. Both of them are running os on sd cards. But the 2.5" is glitchy and disconnects, so only using it for testnet when needed. Interesting comment about msata, thanks for sharing!

I use a normal one, with usb 3.0. What type of hdd were you using with that cable?

"Here's what it is doing instead", great bait. What are they doing instead? cba to read just because of the title
