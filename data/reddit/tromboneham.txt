* SKT1 - 5
* Liquid - 4
* **Axiom - 3**
* IM - 3
* Mousesports - 2
* MYInsanity - 2
* Acer - 2
* Millenium - 2
* CJ Entus - 2
* JinAir - 2
* StarTale - 2
* Teamless - 1

* Invictus - 1
* Yoe Flash Wolves - 1

Sorry, I should have said "non-korean team" I suppose.

He also specifically said *"view numbers for each* ***regional finals*** *easily reaches 100k"*
IEM Cologne != WCS Regional Finals.

It has been hyped pretty heavily, hopefully it gets to that mark. I'm not fully confident if it will though.

I was actually curious. I know 3 out of 48 doesn't seem like much, but in the grand scheme it's actually a pretty decent amount for any team.
But yes, the blind upvoting just because SC2 is probably opposite of the OP's desires, but I'm inclinded to believe it'd happen anyway for each game. You want to see your scene grow, so you're going to upvote the ideas that would help your scene.
