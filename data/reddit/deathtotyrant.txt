Everybody hoards in one way or another, not just in bitcoin but also in precious metals, ammos, food, etc. 
Your point is a moot.

If you're going introduce voting, then your system is broken. 
Voting is where 51 percent rules over 49 percent.

There will always be high and lows in markets. Free markets actually perform much better in these condition. Most of those depression are short lived. Often long depression such as 1930s were caused by central authority and the banking system. It prolong the depression by printing money into existence. By doing so, the value of the currency falls. It hinders people's wealth into whole new levels of lows. Any city-state or countries, that uses monopoly of IPO and trust the monopoly of banking power will face boom and bust cycles due to inherent nature of printing will. It incentives banking to print more and only hand to selective few who needs it. That's not free market at all. 
In fact, it mention that deflation was to blame. That is a lie. The commons were force to use monopoly of IPO within a region of imaginary borders. The central authority requires the commons to use IPO to order to incentive wars. It derives from free markets. It takes wealth away from the commons into the hands of the few. Wars breed depression. 
The entire world are affected right now. The economy hasn't improved for better since 2008. Russia just recently dropped the petrodollar, and several other countries already dropped it as well. The reason is that the central authority is just printing like madness, and all it's doing is pushing shareholder to lose wealth day by day. Nobody wants to hold a commodity that is losing wealth overtime. Which you rather hold, petrodollar, or bitcoin? 
TL;DR - It is better to live through depression period in free market than it is under central authority.
