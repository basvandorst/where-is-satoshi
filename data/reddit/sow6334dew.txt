The statistics on its electricity consumption are mind boggling. There is a case in international law  to suspend its trading based on the fact that Bitcoin is making a fool of many countries solutions to reduce pollution, greenhouse,etc.

I know I have touched a touchy subject and I a agree with you!

Fluidledger uses original thought on a level unseen so it might not be easy for you to understand but it is beyond unreasonable doubt that Bitcoin is not eco friendly and there are many legal actions that could be made to halt it trading and the fact that many countries signed the Kyoto Protocol and allow their citizens to trade this coin is extremely questionable.  High court judge would agree with what I have said.

The countries that signed the Kyoto Protocol are contradicting what they signed by allowing their citizens to trade in Bitcoin because of the damage it is causing in regards to global warming.
