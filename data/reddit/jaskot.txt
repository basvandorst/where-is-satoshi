And honestly, block chain is the most exciting part of the movement anyway. BTC is just one benefit.

Unless the person in question is actually shilling.

Climate change denier, anti abortion, anti civil rights, and more or less a standard GOP senator except for the fact that his dad was a genuine libertarian.

I'm not a troll, I just don't share your optimism about Rand. We were all falling all over ourselves saying that Barry O would be the populist leader that we desperately needed. I was there. And that's what this smacks of. "*Candidate X* of course has to say he agrees with this status quo line of idiotic reasoning in order to get elected, but once he's in, he'll be our man on the inside, and will subvert the military industrial complex's stranglehold on our foreign policy." Only this never happens. It's like Lucy holding the football for Charlie Brown every election. I don't mind Rand Paul as much as some of his GOP compatriots. But his foreign policy in the mid east does not look any less invasive than your average GOP senator. He felt that "we must" do something about ISIS. That's interventionism, and it perpetuates the situation. Just one example.

His foreign policy looks like Sarah Palin's or McCain's. Let's go get entrenched in another destructive war to enrich Lockheed's CEO's and destroy countless lives and make us all less safe.

Well, climate change is a political issue. Water. Clean air. Levees. Public Parklands. Fossil fuel companies receiving disproportionately ginormous corporate welfare. You don't even have to believe in global warming to understand the existential threat of allowing our resources to be wasted and polluted. Is he gonna stand up to Big Oil and King Coal? Is he gonna let Big Ag skate on sucking up all the water that's left in CA? If he can show me that he actually gives a fuck about these things, and is not just another neocon/ neolib, then I might get behind him. He needs to show me where he stands on the power that has been concentrated in Wall Street. Homelessness? Lots of issues on which he needs to show his position.

Is this kind of like how Obama was a socialist until he got elected and started getting cozy with Wall Street? Not buying it anymore.

Fuck your castle and moat, I declare myself leader of the free tree people and will poop all over you if you chop down any of our trees.

Don't say SHILL! Shills do not exist and to suggest otherwise will result in a ban.

Convince yourself however you need to convince yourself. Being the privileged son of a lifelong libertarian is not the same as coming to those same conclusion on your own. His foreign policy statements have been terrible.
