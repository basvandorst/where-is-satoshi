Careful! They just terminated my account cos my node was sucking too much bandwidth. They deleted it without prior notice. Account and server both gone suddenly. Not worth the risk

I made a visual explanation for this 
@_date: 2014-10-22 17:22:39
**Today Each person holds in average 1844.57 bits**, right? At the moment there are about [13,408,500]( bitcoins available and the world population is around [7,269,187,300](

I think it does more good than bad. Helps spread the usage of Bitcoin in some communities and keeps the blockchain free of micro transfers. The 1% is only to withdraw while it allows tipping below the standard bitcoin fees.
And the key point is to make it extremely user friendly.
Of course any day they could disappear with all the tips out there. Just be aware of that and don't use the service if you fear that risk.

It was [proposed here]( (not decided) on 27 Nov 2013. It's just another name for μBTC, uBTC, microBitcoin, Mikeys...

No. Nevermind the clock. The picture (or any form of digital information) can be condensed into a hash, then added to the blockchain. The blockchain "burns" that hash into a block proving that the file was created before (not after) the timestamp of that block. This is a known use of the blockchain as a [Trusted digital timestamp](

'cos criminal activity is the only use for bitcoins and cryptography...
@_date: 2014-10-23 01:38:01
True. My point was that 2 decimal places might be acceptable for average people, but more makes things too complex. IMHO

And you may not... until it is too late. [Then...]( 
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:21:06
You can still find a cheap VPS for 20$/year with more than enough power/memory to support a bitcoind node for around a year, so not there yet... But you are right! looks like [the blockchain grows exponentially]( 
@_date: 2014-11-04 23:45:18
The first scenario crossed my mind but then, they blamed specifically that bitcoind process sucking all the resources. So I really believe that the program went crazy for some reason and became a pain in their ass.
I bet it was easy for them to relate bitcoind with mining (out of ignorance or convenience) and just pull the plug.
That being said, I didn't really have the chance to do some forensics and study the cause of the issue. And that's what bothered me so much. That, together with the arrogance from their responses. 
My lesson learned is: keep a closer look and monitor your VPS performance, and be always prepared to loose all the data. Specially with cheap services one must lower the expectations on the relations with the support service

Careful! They just terminated my account because my node was using too much bandwidth. They deleted it without prior notice. Account and server both gone suddenly. This VPS host it's not worth the risk. Too cheap to be good

I made a visual explanation for the units 
@_date: 2014-10-22 17:10:59
I would say base ten is a well-established convention nowadays. I like the proposal to use 'bits' as base unit and let satoshis become cents, as it is common in many currencies in the world.

There is an [android app for that]( from the creators of [cryptostamp]( But it's for any document, not just photos.
@_date: 2014-10-23 14:54:06
I'm not sure I understand. You want proof that the picture was taken before a specific time. The blockchain is needed to act as that third-party time server you need for your proof. That's the whole point right? 
@_date: 2014-10-23 09:26:30
beware, this app uses a system that not only one document but several (from other people) together in a single hash. That's good to avoid destroying bitcoins forever and to keep the process cheap (less fees), but has a couple of drawbacks: you will need other people's hashes to prove yours is in there and worst, it uses a centralised server.
**tl;dr** this is cheap, but has a single point of failure
@_date: 2014-10-22 23:24:46
I like that. The challenge then is to explain how 
    1 Bitcoin = 1,000,000 Bitcoins
IMHO I don't think the word "Legacy" will do the trick, we need a different word there. Otherwise there will be chaos and confusion. 
A: *Again, how many Bitcoins will be there in total?*
B: *21 trillion*
A: *trillion? last time it was 21 million*
B: *yeah no... [explanation here]*
A: **Chaos and confusion**
@_date: 2014-10-22 16:45:04
it's not so crazy right? 
@_date: 2014-10-23 00:46:50
we are talking about decentralised timestamping here. Of course you could use any other [centralised trusted authority](
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:50:58
wait for it
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:13:45
I had the same offer. Double up to 60Gb. I thought everything was fine as well. I'd recommend you to do a backup and limit your bandwidth and CPU somehow before they do it for you. 
edit: just in case.

The volumes are not the same. I doubt they will get super rich with the kind of amounts they are moving around. It's just for toy amounts. If anyone needs to make a living out of tips might want to use normal transactions
