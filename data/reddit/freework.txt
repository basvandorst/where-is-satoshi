The whitepaper describes the written code. I highly doubt he wrote the whitepaper before writing the code. I say this because 2 months is a very short time to write all the code. If satoshi did write bitcoin in 2 months, then mumblewumble should take about just as long to build, right?...

There is nothing wrong with sharing a proposal so that other people can give feedback, but you have to understand there is a fundamental difference between a proposal with no implementation, and a proposal *with* an implementation.


Satoshi did not iterate on Szazbo's bitgold. The systems have similarities, but Szazbo's proposal is so barebones the similarities are only consequential.
Leonardo Da Vinci made drawings of helicopters in the 16th century. An actual helicopter that you can ride in didn't exist until the 20th century. Did the inventor of the modern helicopter "iterate" on Da Vinci's designs? If Da Vinci had not made those drawings, would the modern helicopter have never existed?
And I think satishi *did* get bitcoin right when he first released it. Take a look at the whitepaper. Even after all these years, the whitepaper unmodified still pretty much describes bitcoin as works today. All the stuff these "hundreds of programmers" have contributed has so very little effect on the system overall that they could have probably never happened and it would be OK. I feel a lot of bitcoin modifications are because programmers want to "stick their finger in the icing" so to speak.


I disagree. Bitcoin is already fungable, and it's already private. The only thing that needs to change is the blocksize limit, to make it scalable. Once we figure out how to handle raising the blocksize limit, bitcoin doesn't ever needs to be changed again (at least probably not for another 20 years or so which is how often other protocols gets updated)

I don't see it that way. You can make *any* movie out of a book, even if the book sucks and the movie sucks. Software is a bit different. Software that sucks is completely worthless. Software that "sucks" is defined as "not working". A movie may suck, but it still is a movie. A cryptocurrency that can't maintain scarcity or can't be used by regular people, then it pretty much has no reason to exist. A shitty movie can still be watched for cringe-laugh value. There is a certain "all or nothing" aspect to cryptocurrency. Either it works, and it;s brilliant, or it doesn't work and nobody cares.
Why does being published anonymously matter any? If anything, it makes this mumblewumble thing more of a joke. Its like someone is trying to cargo cult the Satoshi myth by repeating al the superficial aspects, but bit replicating the thing that made Satoshi an actual brilliant genius: the implementation.
Imagine if Satoshi had just released the whitepaper without an implementation. No one would have cared. Just like no one cared when Szazbo dropped his bitgold paper (which had no implementation).


Satoshi got Bitcoin right on his first try.

You're right, thats exactly how I work. Comparing it to a builder tearing down something that they built wrong is not a fair analogy. Tearing down buildings costs money, if you build the wrong software, all you have to do to fix it is to press the backspace key a bunch of times and type in something else.

The difference between a Da Vinci sketch and a Da Vinci masterpiece is a matter of subjectivity. The difference between a working cryptocurrency and a non-working cryptocurrency is a matter of objectivity. Such objectivity can only be measured by testing/using/observing the implementation. If no implementation exists, that objective distinction can not be determined. Can you determine if a painting is a masterpiece by reading a written description of the painting? Probably not, and for the same reason it's impossible to determine if a cryptocurrency is working by reading a whitepaper with no implementation.


If bitcoin wasn't private and fungible, the darknet markets wouldn't be using it. Despite there being other currencies that have better privacy than bitcoin (monero, dash, etc), they still use bitcoin. That leads me to believe bitcoin is fungible and private.

I really wish people would just stop talking about SPV all together. If I could steal the satoshi identity and use it to make one change to the whitepaper, it would be to remove the SPV section all together. No actual wallets on the network today actually use SPV as satoshi wrote about in the whitepaper. All lightweight wallets now-a-days use an "blockchain API" method that is nowhere near what satoshi wrote about in the SPV section.
Most of the whitepaper, satoshi is describing a system he already wrote. In the SPV section he is writing about something that has not been built yet. Never are things the same when you first come up with the idea compared to the final finished product. I feel like if satoshi had stuck around development until after lightweight wallets became in actual use, he would have issued a amendment to his whitepaper re-writing the entire SPV section.

Its not going to solve all problems immediately, but it's a start.
The terms 'hard fork' and 'soft fork' were coined by the blockstream developers. Its biased terminology that serves their warped view of how bitcoin functions. The terms 'hard upgrade' and 'soft upgrade' are much better in my opinion. Of maybe 'hard change' and 'soft change'. The "hard" and "soft" parts are OK, since they convey something that's actually factual. Its more difficult to perform a hard upgrade than a soft upgrade., hence the core developers affinity for them.

If you really want to shave off bytes on transactions, then take a look at BIP131. That proposal could potentially shave off 99.9% of a transaction size for a TX with 10,000 inputs. The core developers (at least the 'celebrity' ones) have all rejected that proposal and are opting for Schnorr instead (even though they both can be implemented in tandem), when Schnorr only is a ~30% reduction best case scenario. Why have they rejected BIP131? Because it was written by a non-Blockstream developer. Those guys only implement things that they come up with. (see also: Xtreme thin blocks) Even if something is a good idea, if it wasn't their idea, they won't implement it.
 


CoinJoin is the only use that gets a real benefit by Schnorr signatures. CoinJoin is not very popular, so not many people benefit from it.

This is not true. Nodes have every incentive to *not* lie to you. Imagine if blockchain.info tried to lie to users by showing fraudulent transactions in their block explorer. This would be trivial to detect and it would destroy blockchain.info's reputation.


That will never happen. Bitcoin is open source, anyone can run a node if they want. It may require more resources if the blocksize limit is raised, but that won't prevent the enthusiasts from running nodes.

Weren't you arguing earlier that lightning is a simple concept? Now its a complex algorithm? One could argue that BIP38 is complex, it depends on your point of view. To a highschool student with no programming experience, BIP38 is complex. To a college educated programmer with no crypto experience, BIP38 is probably pretty complex. To someone who is a seasoned blockchain developer who has lots of experience writing cryptographic code (such as yourself) BIP38 may be pretty simple.
If someone who has enough knowledge to have the opinion that BIP38 is simple, *and also* thinks lightning is complex, then that says to be an implementation is a **long** way off.


What? Its the *only* meaningful distinction. What is a blockchain, if other than a collection of every single bitcoin transaction ever made? The entire purpose of lightning is that it works in such a way that every single LN transaction **does not** need to persist. Thats the entire reason for lightning's existence. If not, then why are we even talking abut lightning? What *is* it's purpose?


Yes, it is. You are saying lightning is de-centralized because the software is open source and anyone can run their own lightning node. I'm saying multi-blockexplorer API wallets are de-centralized also because there are multiple blockexplorer software implementations in existence (unlike non-existent LN software) that anyone can install and use. Just like with LN, you always have a choice to use whichever blockexplorer API you trust.
@_date: 2016-04-13 22:13:26


Except the developers are planning on keeping the blocksize limit constrained, forcing everyone to transact through lightning. This means TX fees will rise, which means to move funds from "savings" to "checking" you will have to pay a large fee. This will mean unless you're a millionaire (or at least can afford very high TX fees), you'll be forced to only use the "checking" aspect of your wallet.

If the theory is sound, an implementation would already exist. An example of a sound theory is BIP38. I wrote a BIP38 implementation a few months ago, and it only took me one weekend to complete. If I had known more about cryptography, I could have done it in less time. BIP38 is such a sound theory, the body of the BIP reads almost like a tutorial. The Lightning network whitepaper on the other hand is not tutorial-like in any way. After reading the lightning network whitepaper, you are left with more questions than answers.


I'll believe it when I see it.


When I meant to say is that Lightning does not *produce* a blockchain. Lightning nodes are not required to propagate LN transactions to every LN node. The bitcoin blockchain is analogous to nuclear waste, or perhaps exhaust from a gas burning engine. The purpose of bitcoin is not to produce the blockchain. The purpose is to be a currency, the blockchain is a byproduct of the way the system is built. Sort of like how the point of nuclear energy is not to produce nuclear waste, it is to generate energy. If someone were to come up with a way to get nuclear energy without also generating nuclear waste, it would be a truly earth changing breakthrough. Same goes for if someone were to come up with a way to build an internal combustion engine that has zero emissions. A cryptocurrency system that does not produce a blockchain is a similar breakthrough.


This is the same security model as the multi-blockexplorer API method of making a lightweight wallet. A multi-blockexplorer API wallet is not centralized because anyone can run a blockexplorer. Why do we need to create a new system when one with the same security model already exists and is usable *today*?

Part of the problem also is terminology. For some reason, the term "fork" is used when "upgrade" is a more accurate term. A fork is hat happens when the upgrade goes wrong. If the upgrade goes as planed, there is no fork. Its like calling a space shuttle launch a "space shuttle crash". I feel like this biased terminology is part of the problem.
@_date: 2016-04-13 11:20:03


The solution to this problem is to use multiple servers to get the truth about your payments. One server may lie to you, but if your wallet checks a dozen independent servers and they all agree, then that should give you a pretty good assurance that your payment happened. Just as much as a full node would. The odds that a dozen different independent blockchain sources all lie to you *in the same way* is very slim.
@_date: 2016-04-14 16:51:31
The low level protocol does not work by relying on reputation. Reputation is not needed, you can run the math to determine if a block or transaction is valid. If you want to run a light weight wallet, you can't "run the numbers" to determine of any blockchain data is valid because you don't have the numbers to run.
@_date: 2016-04-01 04:31:49


I'm not so optimistic. Lightning is basically a cyptocurrency that works by not needing a blockchain. It does this by basing itself off bitcoin's scripting abilities. 
The only reason why lightning is even needed is because satoshi's bitcoin design required the blockchain to remain in memory. The ever expanding nature of the blockchain is what makes people say "bitcoin can't scale". If Satoshi's design was such that it didn't require the blockchain to stick around no one would be saying bitcoin can't scale, and there would be no need for lightning at all.
It will take another satoshi to come up with a way to do the routing part of lightning, which would basically make it the world's first "decentralized blockchainless cryptocurrency". It would then probably go on to completely replace on-chain bitcoin.
Figuring out the routing part of lightning is not like building an e-commerce site where you can hire a huge team of developers to get it done. Its more akin to solving the unified field theory or something. This kind of breakthrough will take a long time to achieve.
@_date: 2016-04-23 21:12:43
It doesn't work that way. A signature only makes up about 35% of the entire transaction. Anyways, that only represents the complete upper bounds best-case scenario where every single transaction is of that new segwit/schnorr type. These kinds of optimizations only get you so far, at some point the blocksize limit needs to increase.
@_date: 2016-04-01 20:28:11
By raising the blocksize limit. If the blocksize limit is kept at 1MB, then fees will rise and on-chain microtransactions will be the first to become extinct. If you raise the blocksize limit to accommodate growth, fee's stay small, and sending $0.05 worth of coin remains economical.
Brave seems to be using a quasi-centralized system, sort of like how changetip works. They also take a 10% cut. Autotip does not take any cut at all. All the money moves directly from tipper to tipee. In order for autotip to achieve this, it has to work on-chain.
Brave is the middleman, so it's possible brave could get hacked and/or brave decides to not pay you, etc. But since they are off chain, they make a very small footprint on the blockchain, so high fees don't really have much effect.

Um... yeah I'm going to have to take issue with this statement. People often forget that bitcoin was fully working from pretty much day one. There were some major bugs that still had yet to be discovered and handled, but the basic idea had been completely figured out.
Lightning is still not even close to fully working. I've yet to read a description of how payment routing will work other than "the kevin bacon effect". Nick Szasbo's Bitgold is more analogous to LN at this point, not satoshi's Bitcoin.
Maybe "next summer" when the LN devs say they'll be ready for final release, your statement will be correct, but its not correct now.

Only under very specific circumstances. Multisig transactions (which make up a very small portion f the network usage today) will benefit the most. Normal single signature transactions will benefit very little. Schnorr signature's effect on scalability is similar to segwit in the if few wallets implement that feature, its effect is very little. Not every single wallet is going to implement schnorr signatures. If the devs actually cared about making changes to the protocol that will immediately effect users, they'd raise the blocksize limit, or at least stop spreading lies about how it will hurt the network if a hard fork happens.

A "fork" in the sense that the consensus rules change, is not bad. A "fork" in the sense that half the network follows one branch while another portion follow another branch, **IS** bad. The problem is that the same word is used to describe both conditions. This creates confusion among people because they think the two ideas are the same thing, because they use the same word.
Its kind of similar to the work "impeachment". A lot of people think being impeached means you get kicked out of office, but the word really means an investigation is started which *might* lead to getting kicked out.
A "fork" that you describe, is not the same thing as an *actual fork* that leads to a split in the network. Some other word needs to be used in it's place. "Hard upgrade", "Coordinated upgrade", "Change that required coordinated upgrade", etc. These are all better terms than "hard fork".

Miners are all the only ones who stand to lose anything by not upgrading in time. If you're running a node, and you miss the deadline, its no big deal. You just have to make sure you upgrade before you can actually use the node.
Its just like when you try to log in to your macbook, and it tells you you have to restart your computer because of a security update. Its not he end of the world, you just wait 10 minutes then you're back to normal. It takes 10 minutes to download the latest node software and install it. I guess if you're an exchange and you can't afford to lose 10 minutes you might be affected.

Its not the exact same thing. Schnorr and segwit only removes the signature from the transaction. There is more to an input than it's signature. In fact, the signature only makes up about half of the data that goes into an input. The reference to the previous transaction is 32 bytes alone. Schnorr doesn't get rid of the reference to the funding txid, wildcard inputs does.
With Schnorr signatures, if you have 10,000 inputs, you still have to add the rest of the input to your transaction. With wildcard inputs, the entire input can be omitted, which makes it's best case scenario much higher than any other proposal.
By the way, there are just as many people that use on-chain micro-transactions with the same address as there are people who have a use for CoinJoin.
Also, there is nothing wrong with re-using addresses *as a receiver*.

So? Computers are really good at doing this sort of thing. An index on the UTXO data allows scanning to be done fast.


Says who? Why can't the system do this for me? If I "do it myself", it means I have to list each and every input into my transaction, which I have to pay a lot for. This design flaw creates a minimum value at which an utxo can be spent. Any utxo below this value (last time I checked it was something like 80 satoshis) is bound to stay in the utxo pool indefinitely. With wildcard inputs, this minimum goes away. UTXOs of any size can be spent economically, grated its to a non-unique scriptPubKey.


This is not true at all. If you're re-using addresses as a sender, then there is a slight security flaw that allows your private key to get leaked over time. As a receiver, there is no privacy penalty at all by re-using addresses.
The notion that re-using addresses is bad for your privacy is absurd. I have yet to see somebody explain how this is so. Its just a taking point that is repeated over and over again.

This system sounds similar to the system I created with autotip. Companies would donate money to the autotip donation address, then every week, art of that balance would be sent out to the X number of users who tipped the most. It knows who tips the most because it can look at user's blockchain history. The users then tip this money to websites that conform to the autotip API. The problem was that no one uses autotip, so I had to abandon the project. The hard part here is convincing people to give away their bitcoin for free, and also convincing content creators to implement the API.

It is wrong o assume that mining has to be profitable in order for anyone to do it. There are a lot of people who mine because they like bitcoin and want it to succeed. All during 2014 mining was not profitable, yet the hashrate continuously increased.
Take for example tomatoes. It is more ecnomical to buy tomatoes at the store than it is to grow your own after you consider how much time and energy goes into maintaining the plants. Despite this fact, there are millions of people all around the world who grow their own tomatoes. Ho can you explain this?
If the government were to subsidize growing tomatoes, then there would probably be an explosion of tomatoe growers. If some day those subsidies were to stop, many growers would stop growing, the the kicker is *not **every** grower would stop growing*. When the bitcoin block reward halves, *some* miners will drop out, but *not every singe miner* will drop out.
Also why the heck would users want to increase the 21m cap? Raising the cap makes every holder's coins worth less. The only people who want the cap raised is the miners, and only if the increased cap comes in the form of raising the block reward.

And nodes can lie by telling you you don't have any unspent transactions. Read BIP37, and search for the phrase "lie by omission", they mention it like 10 times. At some point somebody is going to do a Sybil Attack on the network that lies to all SPV clients by telling them they have no balance. This kind of attack does not work on full nodes because they don't rely on other nodes to "tell" them their balance, they derive it themselves.
@_date: 2015-12-31 10:34:39


No. Not fewer nodes overall. If blocksize is increasing that means more people are using bitcoin. The node count may very well rise.
Here is another thought experiment: More people using bitcoin means bitcoin companies are more profitable, and more able to afford more higher powered hardware to maintain the blockchain.
Not every person has to run a node in order for bitcoin to survive. Just enough nodes. Sort of like not every single person has to seed a torrent in order for the torrent to survive. Some people can drop off the torrent, and the torrent still operates. Bitcoin depends on altruism, just like bittorrent. That altruism is currently present, and hopefully will remain, as long as the developers allow for increases in capacity.

Only if you are relying on the results of one block explorer. If you cross check multiple sources, you know you're being lied to when the results don't match up.
A block explorer lying to you has the same consequences of a SPV node lying to you. You won't lose any money, but you can be lead to believe you don't have money you actually do have.


No, proof of work still exists and is verified by the block explorer nodes. End users don't verify anything because they don't need to, the same way SPV users don't verify anything today because they don't need to.


If it works for me, it'll work for other people. This is how people will use bitcoin in the future.

My point is that "trickle down" is completely wrong, just like the idea of nodes decreasing due to bigger blocks. In the real world, wealth always trickles *up*. Just like in the real world, node count is a function of number of users, not the size of blocks. People who argue bigger blocks have a centralizing effect are just simply wrong.
@_date: 2015-12-31 09:16:33
Yes. You can have multiple CPUs doing multiple hashes at once. I imagine big mining farms have Map+Reduce set up with hundreds of nodes to hash new blocks. I did the math once, it costs $1500 a day to run a 1000 node Map+Reduce on Amazon EC2. If you run your own hardware, the cost goes down considerably. If you can afford a huge mining operation, you can afford to set up a validating farm too.

You're skipping some steps there. If there are 10GBs worth of transactions being made by the network, then some pretty big things have happened. Generally, transactions made by the network goes up slowly and steadily. It took 7 years to fill up 1MB, another year to fill up 2MB, maybe another year to get 3MB. 10Gb is a long way off. By then, who knows. The cap should raise *at least* as much as network transaction rate.
I don't think any nodes can handle 10GB today. If a miner were to be so bold as make a 10GB block, the darn thing wouldn't even fully download in 10 minutes, so that block would inevitably get orphaned.
@_date: 2015-12-07 18:52:54


This doesn't make sense to me. How does SW increase the max size to 4MB? Removing the signature from a transaction results in like 20% reduction in size, not a 4x reduction in size. How is this change supposed to increase the volume of blocks by orders of magnitude. Also how can SW be used to increase the blocksize further in the future. Once you remove the signatures from the tx you have to remove *something else* in order to make it smaller.

I like the idea of incentivising torrent seeders with bitcoin,but I think this is better implemented differently. With Joystream, you can only pay or get paid if you are running that client. In order for a system like this to become mainstream, everyone has to upgrade to a torrent client that supports this protocol. This means adoption has to start with the torrent client developers, then and only then can you start to get users into the game. Maybe if most torrent clients had a plugin architecture (which would allow you to do it yourself), but most clients don't have that.
I think a better system would be one where you implement Autotip on the torrent download page. Each seeder (or the top X seeder) gets their bitcoin address added to the page. When a new downloader downloads a torrent, they send a small tip to all current seeders. When a seeder drops off the torrent, their address falls off the page, and they won't get any more tips.
In order to implement this, you need to modify the webserver that makes the torrent download page so that it gets the current seeder list from the tracker. This would be an easy change for most trackers, although I don't know how this compares to the process that goes into implementing Joystream....

Anyways, the 0.8 fork was accidental. Forks in the future will be deliberate and controlled, so conditions will be completely different.

This is true only when forks happen out of the blue. When forks are planned and announced in advances, people have the opportunity to prepare. Forks don't last too long anyways. The 0.8 fork only lasted for like an hour or something (I'm too lazy to look it up).
Yes, someone once was able to take advantage of a fork and perform a double spend. Your assertion is that double spends are easy. They are not easy. One person doing it once is not easy.

That was performed as a proof of concept.

Only full nodes can verify a block. You need the block contents to do this verification. SPV wallets are completely at the mercy of the nodes they connect to. There is nothing they can verify for themselves because they would require having the entire block and the entire blockchain.


If you want to argue that using a blockchain API to make a wallet is forgoing proof of work, then you must also say using SPV is forgoing proof of work.


Imagine which wallet your mother or Aunt would use. Can you imagine your Aunt deciding to use a certain wallet because of the theoretical chance of a block explorer API lying to her? Thats absurd.

VISA may be able to handle 60,000 per second, but you can't spend any of the money coming from those transactions until the end of the month. A "full confirmation" bitcoin transaction, on the other hand can be spend again immediately. The 7tps figure that is often cited as bitcoin's limit is actually for full confirmation transactions.

That one guy has to pay a fee for each transaction. If it's indeed one guy, he'll run out of money at some point. If you see a spike in tx volume, it could be one person spamming the network, if you see transaction volume going up steadily, it's probably not just one guy.


I mean they are storing it. Nodes pay to store the blokchain and make the data available for other people to use (Via SPV or other methods like block explorers)


Its hard to answer this. How many seeds does a bit torent need? If you have one seed, thats usually enough to get the file. The more seeds, the better chance of getting the file quickly. If there was only one bitcoin node, that would probably be very risky, but the system would still work. How many nodes does Litecoin have? Probably much less than bitcoin, and they seem to be doing all right. Theres gotta be some altcoins out there with very small node counts.


I'm always amazed at how well seeded some torrents are. I like to download obscure music.

I think you may be over thinking it. When a Leecher starts leaching, he gives 25 cents to all the current seeders. He is saying "Thanks for seeding this torrent, if it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't be able to download this data". Once that leecher himself downloads the whole torrent, he becomes part of the seeder group that gets tips when a new leecher comes online.
If you're the last downloader, you don't get any tips, but you don't upload any data either. If you're the original uploader and you seed the entire time, you'll get the most tips. If you are the only seeder, you'l get the most tips because there is no one to share the tips with. I think the incentives align exactly the same with bittorrent itself.

The "coalescing UTXO problem" (for lack of a better term) is a real problem with bitcoin, and I feel the next big debate after the blocksize one is resolved will be this one.
Not only will solving the coalescing utxo problem help in terms of technical scaling, but it will also have an economical benefit as well. For instance, if 1 million different people send 10 satoshis to one address, it may add up to a lot of bitcoin, but will be very expensive when it comes time to spend that bitcoin.
Because of the way bitcoin transactions work, you have to list every single input individually which results in greater transaction sizes, which means you have to pay more in fees. If there was some way to magically coalesce a million 10 satoshi inputs into one single 0.1 BTC input, you would solve this problem. This can't be achieved without a hard form, and no hard fork can happen without a huge political debate.

You still have to "trust" BitPay when you use them.
You have to "trust" 7-11 now when you hand them a $50 bill to pay for $10 worth of stuff.
You also have to 'trust' a Bitcoin ATM when it prints off a paper wallet for you. No matter what, you have to trust somebody...
You also have to trust that the 'change' paper wallet 7-11 printed for you is secure. The specification I want to write will hopefully sell out measures that make it so these wallets are printed in the most secure manner possible.

People need to understand the difference between a problem and a fear.
A fear is something that might happen in the future, and a problem is something that is causing harm right now.
I'm a software developer, and what I've learned over my career is that it is better to only spend your time fixing problems, and ignoring all fears.
The 1MB limit 'problem' is not really a problem. At this point in time it is only a fear. My suggestion is we wait until the limit has been reached, observe what the effects are, then address the problem based on data observed. Remember, bitcoin is an experiment.
Who knows, maybe the effects of reaching the limit will manifest itself completely different than what anyone expects at this point in time.

I support this effort, but only if you take a more informative approach, rather than tying to 'promote' bitcoin.
People are going to buy into BTC when they understand how the system works, not before. The limiting factor is their ability to learn all the concepts required (wallet/private key/qrcode/etc).
Taking a more 'promotional' stance will only drive people away, by making them think you're try to pump the price.

Because that would mean you would need a hot wallet. Some people will want to do it that way, maybe other people would rather just deal with paper bitcoin. Sometimes you don't want to takeyour phone with you. Maybe you're an old person and technology confuses you. A pice of paper with two QR codes and "0.03 BTC" printed on it is a simple thing that even grandmas know how to reason with.
As far as trusting 7-11, its not an issue as long as you're giving paper wallets thats nott a huge amount of money You obviously aren't going to pay with a paper wallet worth 500BTC. Ideally you'd walk around with $50 worth of BTC or so. You trust 7-11 to not mess up your change when you habd them $20 bill. Why not trust them to make change with BTC?

I don't like this for two reasons:
First, it falls victim to the problem that Diaspora and the like suffer from: You can't replace an existing established network by simply copying it. Don't build a "decentralized twitter" build a "decentralized service that makes twitter obsolete". Diaspora is a ghost town because its a "decentralized social network". In other words a direct clone of facebook minus the centralization. That may be a technical advantage, but regular users don't care enough about that to switch over. Diaspora has no features that people actually care about enough to switch, and neither does this Twister thing.
Secondly, a blockchain is not meant for this purpose. A block chain is great for monetary transactions where a complete days worth is measured in megabytes. A system like this where arbitrary data is being stored will cause the blockchain to grow so fast, it won't be too long before normal users will not be able to fit it onto a consumer grade harddrive.

Increasing the block size is not a workaround. In my opinion, it is the most elegant solution. It is the solution that lets Moore's law take care of everything.

The lightning network only helps to decrease transaction amount when there are two parties transacting between each other. If there are lots of people wanting to transact between many people, the lightning network will not make no difference.
Lets say you have a room full of 100 people. 50 of those people want to give 0.05 in bitcoin to 50 other people. Even with payment channels, you have to make 50 channels. Those 50 channels will all settle to 50 transactions (one tx per channel)
Where the lightning network shines is when you have a room full of 2 people, and those two people need to constantly transact amoungst one another. In that case they can open a channel between them, and transact all day, while only one transaction settles onto the blockchain per day. In this case you can turn a very large number of small transactions into one large transaction, which will help the blockchain grow slower.

Once a transaction gets confirmed, it can't be malleated any more. You seem to be under the impression that a transaction can be malleated at any time during the duration of the channel's life.


How does malleating a transaction make it not possible for the 3rd party to send you funds? Malleability doesn't affect the validity of a tx, just the resulting TXID...


Monitoring has to be continuously, not once every day or so. What if the attacker attempts to steal your funds the minute after you download the last "day or so" to check through? You won't find out about it until another "day or so", and by then it'll be too late.

I say we completely get rid of the block limit all together.
Back in 2010 it made sense to have a block size limit, as it was essential in those days that bitcoin could be installed on a typical desktop or laptop. Now a days that is not a concern, as there are plenty of lightweight wallets out there for people to use.
Keeping the blockchain size small is not a priority anymore.
Anyways, if someone tried to broadcast a huge block, by the time their gigantic block gets completely propagated, someone would have already broadcasted a smaller block, preventing that gigantic block from making it into the blockchain.

They can set AD/EB, but since they don't make blocks, the setting they use won't be communicated to the rest of the miners. On the other hand, miners write their EB/AD settings to the block, so other miners can know what each other's settings are.
Lets say I'm a miner. I find a block. How big do I make this block? I look at the past 100 blocks, and determine 95% of the hashpower has an EB setting above 2MB. That means I can make a block 2MB and 95% of the miners will accept that block immediately. The other 5% will reject that block and wait for one that is smaller. Since there is only 5% who think 2MB is excessive, it will take a long time for one of those miners to find a block. If each of those miners have a reasonable AD set (say 6 or so), they'll eventually accept the bigger block once no smaller block is found after AD blocks.
Lets say I look at the last 100 blocks and see that 50% of miners have an EB set to 20MB, and the other 50% have it set to a lower limit. This means if I make my block 20MB, 50% will accept the block, and 50% will wait for a smaller one. Depending on luck, the 50% that rejected my block may find another one before enough blocks are found on top of my block to satisfy the rejector's AD. Therefore I am incentivized to not make my block that big.

I think they help demonstrate (or 'prove' depending on how you look at it) one of bitcoin's biggest strengths: it's open source code. Most people have no idea what open source even means. If you explain to them what an altcoin is, they'll understand what open source means.
You can't make your own dollar, but you can make your own crypto. Crypto's existing with different names helps demonstrate this fact.
Also, there is this concept you don't see talked about much, called "crypto numismatics". You know how people collect coins? This is called numismatics. If bitcoin is the currency of the future, then is makes sense to assume future generations are going to collect cryptocurrencies in the same way current generations collect coins from the 18th century. For this reason I have been buying small amounts of each and every altcoin I can purchase. I'm not putting my life savings into one single coin, I'm buying roughly $5 worth of each one. I have a binder full of paper wallets which is where I store all of them. Maybe some day that binder will be worth millions. Even if most of those coins gets hacked, even if one of them survives, it could be worth a lot.

Yes this is very much possible. Highly unlikely to happen, but possible, none the less. The process would be as follows:
1. The community decides on a precise block when the deadline will be.
2. Devs add code to the official miner client that adds a bunch of transactions to the "deadline block", along with the normal transactions.
3. 51% of the miner community would have to upgrade to the version of the client that has this code. If they failed to reach 51%, the blockchain will fork, but it will lose out to the other version without the gox bailout code.
If they got 51%, it would be the first bitcoin bailout. If enough people really want this to happen, it can happen. When it will pass or not, it a completely other matter. If it did pass, we can no longer say bitcoin is limited to 21 million units. It would be technically 21,750,000.
As it is now, most miners are not upgrading their clients as new versions come out. People are kinda setting it and forgetting it.

Bitcoin scaled from 1KB blocks to 1MB blocks without quadratic hashing fixed. Nobody knows how big blocks can get before quadratic hashing becomes an actual problem.

I just want to say that limiting the mempool size is absolutely *not* the way to go. That is effectively why we got into this mess to begin with.
First off, the mempool isn't just one thing, in the way a block is. If one person has a full node running on their laptop, along with firefox and a bunch of other apps, then their mempool is probably something like 1 GB (assuming their laptop has 8GB of RAM)
Another full node, running on EC2 is only running that full node (no other processes), has 32GB of memory, and it's mempool is 32 GB.
A mempool limit will mean the EC2 node won't be able to use all of it's resources, but it will also mean anyone can run a node on their laptop. It will also mean that once network traffic picks up, instead of transactions taking a long time to confirm, they'll just straight up drop out.
There are a lot of use cases for payments that don't have to confirm immediately. Think of Adsense payments. When somebody clicks an ad on your site, you get like $0.05 per click. Google sends you a check once per month. In this case the payment can take up to a month to confirm. Obviously, if you're standing in line at the Walmart checkout, you want *that* transaction to confirm quickly, but that doesn't mean that *all* transaction need to confirm immediately.
What all transactions *do need to do* is not be dropped from the mempool, which is effectively like a payment processor performing a random chargeback.

Technically you are right, but it is not likely to ever happen. What would happen is every single person on earth lost their gold? That is not likely to happen because gold is valuable and people generally are good at keeping things that are valuable. Some gold gets lost, but the large majority is safe and sound. Bitcoin is the same way.
It *is* easier to lose a bitcoin than gold, but over time humans will learn how to handle bitcoin without losing it. I think when humans first started using paper money and coins (like in 500 BC or whenever), there were people who kept losing their coins because they weren't used to handling them.

I don't follow. Two chains can only exist if two miners make conflicting blocks. For instance, one miner makes a block  and another miner makes their own block  and part of the network follows one block, while the other follows the other one.
Nodes have nothing to do with it. AD and EB setting don't apply to nodes, miners only. As a node you get whatever blocks the miners decide to create. Miners are incentivized to not make blocks a portion of the network will orphan.


Except for the investment of electricity generating multiple "too big" blocks...


There is no such thing as "small miners" and "large miners" any more. 75% of mining happens by about 10 pools. If those pools can afford to get so much hashpower, they can afford to acquire a fast enough connection to have a high AD and EB settings.

Multiple honest mining farms coming together to form a dishonest cartel is very unlikely. What is more unlikely is a government agency assembling a gigantic *dishonest* mining farm. For all we know, this may already be underway.
At some point in the future when everyone's hot water heater is driven by a mining chip, and big office buildings are heated by mining equipment, the difficulty will be so high, it will be physically impossible to compile enough hashpower to come even close to 51%.

I don't believe it. I can see them fixing some obscure corner case that was slow under Finney's code, but I don't believe overall they were able to achieve anywhere near 600% speedup. Show me the evidence. Validating EC signatures is a mathematical process that can't really be sped up much with software optimizations.


Validating signatures does not need to be constant time nor constant memory. Its the algorithm that generates the signature that has to be constant time/memory, as it could cause the private key to leak via timing attack. There is nothing to leak when validating a signature, because the private key is not known by the validating node. This is another example of superfluous commits from the core developers used to inflate their importance to the development of bitcoin.


I suspect most rocket scientists don't perform superfluous work for political reasons.

You're technically right about the hashpower. It all depends on how you define 51%. The point I was trying to make is that it takes a lot of resources to build a 24 hour long chain. If you add up all miner costs across every single mining pool over a 24 hour period, thats how much it'll cost to run a 51% attack for 24 hours. We're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars in just electricity alone. Maybe back in 2009 not checking signatures after 24 hours would be a very bad idea. But now in 2016 it is very unlikely anybody will be able to pull off a 51% attack for a few hours, let alone 24 hours straight.

The update required for a hard fork is not alagus to the upgrade required for segwit.
Segwit changes the transaction format. Every wallet software has to be updated.
Increasing the blocksize has no effect on the transaction format, so no wallets need to be updated, only the software that runs full nodes.
Back in 2010, full nodes *were* wallets, but in 2015, full nodes have become decoupled with wallets. There are 10x the number of wallets as there are nodes. There is no way to verify these numbers, they are my best guess.
The upgrade required to achieve a blocksize limit increase is much easier than the upgrade to get segwit going.

Thats not how it works. First off, you can't publish a humongous block unless you have a lot of hashpower. Because the difficulty is so high, it takes hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of electricity and hundreds of thousands of dollars of computer hardware in order to make a block in the first place. Secondly, a huge block that takes a long time to propagate will simply be orphaned by another miner who publishes a smaller block that finishes propagating faster.
By the way, the purpose of an attack is to stop people from using bitcoin to move coins from one person to another. The point of an attack is not to simply use resources. I can see why somebody would spend a lot of money to bring the system down, but its not clear why somebody spend so much money to simply waste people's hard drive space...

If its finite, then what is that amount? How many GB should we limit it to?


I think it should. If the network accepts your transaction, its a valid transaction, and at that point there should be a 100% guarantee it will eventually make it to the blockchain. As of right now, this is already the case. It only really starts to become a problem when 1MB blocks start to fill up and the possibility of mempools overflowing becomes a reality.
Not all mempools will overflow at the same time. Not all mempools have the same maximum size. The mempool exist insode the computer of each miner. Some miners have more memory than other miners. When "the mempool" starts to "fill up", they won't all fill up at the same time. Some mempools will overflow, while others will be safely filling up and emptying as normal.

Not True. This is an example of the overloading of the term "fork".

If the coordinated upgrade goes as planned, there is no fork at all. Your statement that increasing the limit "induces a fork" is wrong. If people subvert the coordination process (75% + 28 days) then a fork will happen...
The term "fork" should only be used to describe the condition where some nodes on the network follow one chain, while a portion of the network follows another chain.

If the channel operator acts dishonestly, and you catch them, you can get your money back. If you're internet cuts out, and the channel operator acts dishonestly but you miss it, you can lose money. If you just simply send a transaction through the bitcoin network and the TX makes it into everyone's mempool, you don't need to monitor anything. As long as you included a sufficient fee, your TX will get confirmed, and you will never lose any money. Payment channels *simulate* the raw transaction process, but it's different enough for LN to be considered not bitcoin.

There is no evidence that raising the max block size limit will have any effect on de-centralization. There is actually evidence of the contrary. Go to the pirate bay and click on any section. Now sort torrents by seeds. You'll see that the torrents with the most seeds are not necessarily the torrents of the smallest files. And torrents with the least amount of seeds are not necessarily the smallest files. The correlation is more aligned with popularity. The torrents of Game of Thrones and Broad City have the most seeds, even the 20GB blue ray entire season torrents. As bitcoin's popularity grows number of nodes will increase as well, regardless of how large the bockchain becomes.

A double spend attack is not something you can perform against the network. There has to be a single address that is the victim of a double spend attack. Each time a miner wants to double spend a tx, they need to find a tx worth double spending. It is very far fetched to assume a miner will be doing this any more than once in a blue moon. Even if a mining pool *were* to be so bold as to do this, their reputation would be ruined, and they would have no hashpower anymore.

At an increased risk of having your block (and block reward) orphaned. Everyone who matters on the network is behind a fully validating node. If a miner publishes an invalid block, everyone who matters will reject it immediately.
During times of protocol stability (no hard forks or soft forks being deployed) validationless mining gives a slight advantage over fully validating mining if you're a *small* miner, not a large miner. The advantage you get from validationless mining is a function of how long it would take to validation in the first place. If you're mining on a rasberrypi, it may take 5 minutes to validate a block, so in that case validationless mining will give you an advantage. If you're a large miner with a datacenter full of hardware, you are probably able to validate a block in maybe 2 or 3 seconds. If that is the case then SPV mining will not save you much time, and is not worth the improved risk of orphaning.
By the way, taking advantage of a forked network is harder than it sounds. It i true that SPV mining amplifies forks and multi-block re-orders, but its not true to say that SPV mining increases fraud on the network. It is only theoretically possible to take advantage of a fork by double spending, and it is very rare in the real world.

It actually *has* already risen to an extent, just not enough to really have an effect. In the early days you could make a transaction with 0 fees, and it would *always* confirm immediately. Now zero confirm transactions *never* confirm immediately.

Not true. The 75% miner vote along with 28 day grace period is sufficient to prevent a significant fork. At worst the winning chain will be 75% hashpower, which is enough to keep the system going until the stragglers catch up. Many believe a 51% minority is enough, but 75% was chosen to be extra safe.

When a fork happens, the only difference between the two forks is the coinbase transactions going to different miners. The actual transactions are the same in both chains. Most likely the fork will be over very quickly, but if it doesn't, then you just have to make sure that when you move coins, you make sure both chains see your transaction.

This doesn't surprise me. Exchanges want there to be two currencies. They make money off people trading between the two. It's too bad for them that the miners don't want there to be two currencies. None of the major "big block" people have come out in favor of backing their big block fork if it turns out to be a minority. If the hard fork happens with a super majority of hashpower, then there can't be two currencies, which is the approach BU supporters are taking. There won't be a fork until activation, which won't happen until at least 75%, even more, which may not yet happen for months or even years.
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:40:12
The last thing you'd want to do during a fork is have both chains show different owners for the coins your hold. If I were a merchant, and you tried to pay me coin during a fork, I'd only accept the coins if they show me being the owner on both chains. If one of the chains showed the coins belonging to someone else, those coins are in my book "compromised". If the coins you paid me are only valid on the small block chain, and the big block chain wins, my money goes away. If both chains show me as the owner, it doesn't matter which chain wins, either way I still have my coins.
By the way, it is very difficult to move your coins one way on one chain, and another way on the other chain. From the node's perspective, it has no idea if another node is using a different fork from itself. All the node cares about is if a transaction is valid or not. If it's valid it sends it off to other nodes. If it's not valid, it doesn't pass it along. Theres no way to tell a node to only pass a transaction along to nodes on any particular fork.
You'd essentially have to use one of peter todd's double spend scripts to sneak one version of the tx to the smallblock nodes, and another version to the bigblock nodes. Even then, it would take many tries to do it right.

The bocksize has very little effect on bandwidth usage. The size of the block only represents the amount of data that has to be re-propagated every 10 minutes.

Segwit doesn't solve the quadratic sigops problem, at least not completely. In order to fix that problem completely, one of two things need to happen:
1. Old style transactions (non-segwit) need to become completely extinct on the network. Even after segwit activates, as long as somebody can still make a non-segwit transaction, a miner can generate a block full of a single old-style transaction that is the size of the entire block that chockfull of sigops, attacking all nodes with excessive sigops.
2. A maximum transaction size is instituted. If this occurs, segwit doesn't even need to be activated, and the excessive sigops problem is completely solved. BU have plans to institute a maximum single transaction limit, core on the other hand has as far as I can tell been silent on the issue of maximum single transaction size.

The soft fork version of segwit doesn't actually solve transaction malleability. Precisely because the old way to transact is still valid, all transactions those old wallets create are still vulnerable to transaction malleability.
If I'm using the old version, and you're one the new version, all transactions I make are valid, and also vulnerable to malleability. Even if you are using the newest version, I'm not, and the sender is the one who makes the transaction.
The only way for sigwit to actually fix malleability is to force *all wallets* to abandon the old way and switch to the new way. That way nobody is making transactions that are malleable, and exchanges can other wallets can stop worrying about malleability.
Because segwit as a soft-fork this will never happen. Malleability will continue to exists.

This is completely wrong. Custodial wallets are effected by a fork in the same way any other wallet is effected by a fork.
After a fork there will be three kinds of bitcoin: prefork coins (spendable on both chains), post-fork small block coins (only spendable on the small blockchain), and post-fork big block coins (only spendable on the big block fork).
If the fork lingers, those three types of coins will probably have different values. Some merchants may not want coins that can't be spent on the big block, and vice versa. Coins that have the same owner on both chains will be universally accepted by everyone.
Pre-fork coins will probably be worth the most, post fork coins will be worth less. If the market thinks the big block is more likely to survive, post-fork big block coins will be worth more than small block post-fork coins.
I don't think the fork will linger for too long, as the big block chain is more usable since it can confirm your transaction quicker and with less fees. If a fork actually does happen, it'll be like y2k; there will be a lot of hype, but when it actually happens, it'll be the biggest non-event.
The only people who lose anything during a fork are the miners who waste electricity mining the fork that eventually gets abandoned.

This is how I think it should be done:
xchanges set up two markets, **prefork BTC -&gt; post-fork core**, and the other is **prefork BTC -&gt; post-fork BU**
Since "post fork BU" and "post fork core" coins do not yet exist (as the fork has not yet happened), these markets will be frozen. You judge the demand by looking at the orderbook. If post-fork BU is more popular, you'll see more buy orders on that exchange compared to buy orders on the other exchange.
Once the fork happens, miners will be holding either post-fork BU or post-fork core depending on which side they mine. Without such markets the miners are holders, but with these markets existing, the miners can trade their post-fork coins for pre-fork coins, which are less risky (since they work on both chains)
The reason why exchanges don't want to do this is because they only make money when trades are executed. If no orders get executed, then exchanges make no money. Such a scheme I have described will make absolutely no profit for the exchange until the day of the fork (if there even is one).

Thats exactly intended behavior. We want many whales to put their money down. A whale with the opposite opinion on the issue can do the same to the "post-fork core" future market.


I don't buy it. If everyone pulls their orders before the fork happens, the miners will not let the fork happen. If it does end up happening, the fork will probably become abandoned (orphaned) because of the lack of orders in the future markets means those miners have nowhere to dump their coins.


As soon as a block greater than 1MB block is found on the network, (with other miners are building on top of it), the market freezes. If that block gets orphaned before the 100 block grace period (which is built into the protocol), the market unfreezes.


The bitfines "fork tokens" becomes extinct if the fork doesn't happen by the end of the year.

In the case of a contentious hardfork (where less than 100% is on board), the winning fork gets weakened slightly, while the losing side is weakened greatly. Getting weakened slightly has little effect on security. In this case getting weakened greatly has a very large effect on security. Losing 75% of your hashpower suddenly will cause that fork to be testnet levels of useless.

This will only happen with a wallet that uses the strict "SPV" method described in the whitepaper. Very few actual wallets today use that method, Breadwallet is the only one I think. Most lightweight wallets use the Blockchain.info/Electrum method of getting UTXO data from a "centralized" node.
If it were up to me, SPV should be put to final rest. SPV may have been a good idea in 2009, but now-a-days we have better ways to build lightweight wallets.

Because the actual blocksize is still limited by 1e6 bytes. The extra 700KB of space segwit gives us can only be filled by witnesses data.
Its like saying we made the bus 30% bigger, but the only stuff that can fit into that extra space is luggage. We want the actual bus to be bigger, not the luggage area. Technically making the luggage area is making the bus bigger, just like how segwit technically makes blocks bigger.
An actual blocksize limit would allow all transaction data capacity to increase.

Honestly, SPV needs to be abandoned. It's basically a method for building lightweight wallets. Its not the only way to build a lightweight wallet. There are better more modern ways to do it. Blockchain.info for instance is a lightweight wallet that is *not SPV*. I've built two different wallets myself (one in python, one in js) and neither of them are SPV. I built them on top of blockexplorer APIs (and I build them to speak multiple APIs so its not 'centralized')
SPV has the benefit of being in the whitepaper and the originator of the concept is satoshi himself. Unfortunately for this reason people will always speak about it and and act like its a very important thing to have working. Until satoshi himself comes back and tells everyone to forget SPV, we're stuck with it.

Yes there is. It's called market depth. The deeper the market, the more enticing it is for miners to mine that fork. Holding post-fork coinbase is risky (on either side of the fork). Owning pre-fork coins is much less risky. The "prediction" market with larger depth will be the more attractive side to mine.


The punishment will come when the fork actually happens, if you choose the wrong side. If no fork occurs, no punishment is required. This is the problem with bitfinex's prediction market. If no fork happens, those who bought the BTU coins will lose all they have invested (be punished).
If the exchanges freeze the market before the fork actually happens, no one can "pull their orders"

There was no personally identifiable information stored there. The only thing the attacker could do is steal bitcoins, but you aren't supposed to keep BTC in your account.

You can't just perform a double spend on any transaction you want. A double spend attack is basically reversing a transaction. If a miner issues a block that double spends every output, they aren't going to be the ones that benefit from that attack. The people who spent those outputs will benefit.

That's not true. Not every person needs maximum security. For some, minimum privacy is all that's needed. For the majority of people on earth, the privacy behind lightweight wallets is good enough.

The mechanic goes on and on about how a nitrous system is the exact same thing as a supercharger because they both increase horsepower. That mechanic is the bitcoin core devs. And you are the dumbass too stupoid to realize you've had the wool pulled over your eyes.
Segwit is *not* a blocksize increase. It is an *effective* blocksize increase and thats a big difference. Segwit only allows for 1.7 MB effective blocksize. Raising the blocksize limit with a hard fork can be repeated over and over again to allow for unbounded capacity. For instance you can raise the blocksize to 4MB or 8MB or even 1000 MB. Segwit is only capable of 1.7 and thats if the *entire* wallet ecosystem upgrades. If only a fraction of the wallet ecosystem upgrades it will be even less.

First off, "driving independent autonomous enforcement of the rules by its users out of the system" doesn't even make sense. If all full node validation occurs on VPS instances ran by exchanges and large merchants, then those servers become part of the system, they are not "out of the system". Secondly, even if that does happen, it could hardly be called "centralization". Since there is not one single exchange that rules the market, "market consensus" occurs across many entities. Anyone (even those who are one shitty connections and slow systems) can calculate market consensus very easily by verifying that all full nodes owned by the major players agree that any coin is valid. These "major players" are decided on by the market. Coinbase and Bitpay are market leaders because the market choose them, not because they were chosen by a central committee. If Brian Armstrong gets caught up in a sex scandal or something and it leads to the downfall of Coinbase, then some other company will take it's place.
Thirdly, bitcoin's success has nothing to do with efficiency. Nobody chooses a financial system for its efficiency. The choice to use bitcoin does not depend on how efficient the system is. All people care about are the things like usability. The factor that most effects usability is transaction fees. 99.9% of bitcoin users don't give a shit how many nodes there are, and there is no reason why they should care.
@_date: 2016-06-26 17:30:37


What you've just described is "development centralization". That is the idea that a single development entity writes code, releases it, and pushes it to the miners who run the code without ever looking at what the new code does. This is indeed very dangerous. Back when satoshi was around, I don't think many miners thought too much about what was in each new release, they just ran the code because they liked/trusted satoshi. Now that bockstream controls development, the situation is a little different. There is a less than zero chance that seqwit is not adopted by the mining network and never goes live. Some miners have came out and said they will not run seqwit... That behavior was unheard of when Satoshi was around.
Also, I don't think profitability has anything to do with a miners decision to mine or leave mining. Does a gambler care about his profitability when deciding to leave the casino? The gambler and the bitcoin miners do what they do because they enjoy doing it. As long as miners enjoy running their equipment, miners will still continue to do so. I think a lot of miners mine bitcoin because its the  crypto. If bitcoin loses it's  spot, that will have a much bigger effect on the hashrate than a falling price.

Blocksize is indeed an issue. Transaction fees are getting higher and higher as the price rises. The higher the fees become, the less useful bitcoin becomes. Its not the end of the world for crypto, because you can always convert to an altcoin that *will* handle larger transaction loads by recognizing the importance of the blocksize limit.

It was arbitrary when bitcoin was first created. Now that bitcoin is 7 years old, that 21M limit is no longer arbitrary.
In the early days (pre-2010) If someone had discovered a show-stopping bug that would have compromised the entire system, and a fix to that problem was to raise the 21M limit to some other higher number, it would have been all right. At that point in time, very little money had been invested in bitcoin, so the tokens being worth less through inflation would have been less of a problem. Now that many people have poured in lots of money into the system, raising the cap has much more impactful effect.
The same thing is happening to the 1MB block limit. It was originally arbitrary, but now it has become something people feel is really important to bitcoin, and will likely never change, unfortunately.
@_date: 2016-06-26 22:25:50
"Development centralization" is a terrible term. I only used it because thats the term everyone else uses. Its not correct to describe the development situation in bitcoin right now as "decentralized". 90% of the network uses a client that is controlled by a small number of people who all work for or are closely related to Blockstream. Even though there are multiple implementations like Classic and Unlimited, it is not correct to describe this situation as "decentralized". Lets say Blockstream runs out of money, and those developers follow Mike Hearn's steps and leave the game forever. What will result is a "re-centralization" of development as Classic and Unlimited rejoin the core effort. Classic and Unlimited are is almost complete agreement with one another, there is no reason why they wouldn't join efforts. Both development teams agree that Classic is the short term solution, and Unlimited is the long term solution. I do not know of any disagreement between the two groups.

You don't know that. Visa scale is not possible today on todays hardware, but you don't know that future hardware. In 50 years, there may be fast hardware easily available to handle VISA scale. By the way, today we don't need VISA scale because bitcoin doesn't have that many users to justify the need.


You don't know what the word centralized means. Something dosen't just magically become centralized. If you take three wheels off a car it doesn't magically become a unicycle. Raising the blocksize limit doesn't make bitcoin centralized anymore than removing the 21M cap makes it centralized. If you want an example of a centralized currency, take a look at Liberty Reserve. That currency is centralized. There is only one node and only will ever be one node. Bitcoin will never have 1 node, no matter what.


If a miner publishes a block that is too big for the network to handle, that block will become orphaned. The miner who published that too large block will be the one who is hurt. If the block is accepted by the network, then it is not too big by definition.

It *is* the only thing that needs to be considered. When you're house is on fire, you don't worry about the fire extinguisher ruining your curtains, nor do you care about the fire truck making tire marks on your driveway. All of the concerns regarding the dangers of raising the blocksize limit are way overblown.
Adoption is the most important metric that bitcoin should worry about. Imagine how useless the dollar would be if only 0.1% of the population accepted it.
Malleability is not an urgent issue from the currency user's standpoint. Despite malleability I can use bitcoin without any problems. The only people who *need* maleability fixed are those who need it for an offchain commercial product they are building. (I can't mention the name of the company on this forum or my post will get auto-deleted). Capacity on the other hand, *is* urgent.

Thats like saying it's dangerous to change the oil in an car with a 8-cylinder engine, but it's safe to change the oil on a car with a 6-cylinder engine. The number of cylinders has nothing to do with changing the oil. Capacity has nothing to do with the process of hard forking.
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:18:30


The entire ecosystem has to adopt segwit too in order for the segwit capacity to be realized. A hard fork to raise the blocksize limit just has to be adopted by nodes, and all adoption entails is installing the latest version. Segwit requires software to be written which takes much more time.


There is no chance whatsoever. All transactions will be valid on both forks. Even if a chain split does happen, both halves of the split will contain mostly the same data.


Other currencies have done it without problems. Dogecoin, Reddcoin, and ETH are some that come to mind. If hard forks are so disruptive then why were these currencies able to do it and not split into two? Number of users and market cap have nothing to do with it. If you are so sure that bitcoin having a higher market cap makes it not able to hard fork safely, then please explain why because the reasoning is not clear at all.
@_date: 2016-06-26 17:00:54


Not everybody needs to run a full node. If you're just a regular person who makes one or two transactions per day, you do not need to run a full node. If you're an exchange or merchant that processes a high volume of payments, you might have a need to run a full node.Anyways, the bitcoin system is not going to see 8GB/10 minutes until at least a few decades from now. By then who knows, maybe 8GB will be possible from home.


What about in 2009 when Satoshi released the code for bitcoin? During that time mining was done by Satoshi himself and a handful of other people. Why didn't everybody just go "whaaaaaaat? only a handful of miners, thats centralized!". Back then people were smart enough to know that decentralization is not simply a function of the number of nodes on the network. It wasn't until the blockstream brigade developed that this idea that node count determines decentralization came about.
Anyways, name me something that you could *not* do back in the early "centralized" days that you *can* do now that the node count is in the thousands? What will you no longer be able to do in bitcoin when mining goes back to being "centralized" to a small number of nodes? As far as I know, the system works exactly the same no matter how may nodes there are. The only differences are purely ideological.

Bitcoin's decentralization will never be destroyed. Just like how Liberty Reserve's centralization could never be destroyed. The "centralness" attribute of a system like can not be changed.
If you remove three wheels from a car, that does not magically make the car a unicycle. Removing some nodes from the bitcoin network does not make the bitcoin system centralized.
The property of decentralization in bitcoin comes from the ability to freely start a full node. Being able to do this from a home connection or "easily" (whatever that means) has nothing to do with it.
The only way to destroy bitcoin's decentralization is to make it s that you have t register with a single entity in order to mine blocks. As long as that doesn't happen, bitcoin will always be 100% decentralized.

In my book, bitcoins are only genuine if they are present in Coinbase's node. Or maybe BitPay's node. Ultimately they are the ones who are in charge of determining whether a coin is genuine or not. Xapo, Coinbase, Bitpay and all these companies have a strong incentive to be on the same chain. Each of these companies have said a long time ago that they will follow the longest chain, regardless of how big the size of the block.


Bitcoin's decentralization is the only thing that makes it special.
I disagree. Litecoin, Peercoin, Dogecoin, Etherum, Dash etc. are decentralized in the exact same way. What makes bitcoin special is that it is the most popular blockchain of it's kind. CNN writes articles about BTC and hardly ever mentions the altcoins. If the 1MB limit stays in place for too long, another blockchain will become more popular and CNN will start writing articles about that one instead of BTC. Bitcoin will still work, but it won't be special at all.

With a 1MB blocksize, McD's will *never* accept bitcoin, so my dream will never come true. Why would a big company like that go through the work of implementing a currency that only 1000 people use?

I disagree. The core developers say over and over again that they "don't have any power", but I don't buy it. In 99% of software projects, the "core developers" pretty much dictate what goes into the software, and users upgrade to the newest version. Bitcoin is the only software project I've ever heard of where the "official" developers claim they have no power over their userbase.
Look at the "dao hardfork disaster". Despite the controversial nature of that change, the majority of the network upgraded to the version that took back the stolen funds.
If the core developers release a hard fork to raise the blocksize limit, it *will* get adopted by the majority of hashpower and full nodes.

I completely disagree. Have you ever used bitcoin before blocks were full? Confirmations always happened within 10 minutes, zero confirm was reliable and safe. Once blocks filled up was when it became a "less compelling payment solution". It hasn't caught on a massive scale because of marketing reasons.

You don't make money directly from running the node, you get money from being part of the company that is known for creating LN. Imagine if Satoshi was still around and known by his real name... He'd be getting million dollar offers from various enterprise organizations for consulting gigs. If LN takes over bitcoin, blockstream developers will also get million dollar consulting gigs for being part of the company whose brainchild is the LN.

If BU activates with supermajority, it doesn't need "reorg protection". It only needs that if it intents to ever activate at or near 50/50 hashrate. I'm almost 100% positive no BU supporters want to activate with anywhere near 50/50. They are all unanimously in favor of super majority hashpower split where no re-org is possible.

You can only prune away data that does not effect generation of the UTXO set. Th entire purpose of bitcoin is for users to modify the UTXO set. If the only data that segwit allows into blocks can immediately be pruned, then that data by definition is spam data.

@_date: 2017-01-22 02:20:06
If you really wanted to reduce the UTXO set, then a better way would be to change the blocksize limit from being denominated in bytes, to being denominated in outputs. That way spending lots of inputs costs less than making a bunch of inputs. This will incentivise transactions that reduce the UTXO set.
@_date: 2017-01-21 22:39:59


This is actually correct. The SPV section of the whitepaper was just satoshi thinking aloud. The idea of a client only mode was what he was trying to communicate. The actually technical mechanics of how it will work make no sense. It's the worse part of the whitepaper in my opinion.


Not all lightweight clients depend on the same 3rd party. There are even lightweight wallets that don't depend on any one 3rd party. Since Bitcoin is open source, you can create your own 3rd party, unlike a traditional bank where you have to pay millions of dollars to go through the regulatory process. The cost to run a bitcoin node will always be orders of magnitude less than what it costs to run your own traditional bank node. Even if bitcoin grows to gigabyte blocks.

One address was mutated in the past. All other addresses have not been mutated, and will never be mutated. I'm pretty sure the ETH devs regret that whole incident and will not attempt to mess with the ledger again. The word "mutable" is not correct to describe what the DAO hardfork did... You need to come up with another term. When you say "ETH is no longer immutable", you're giving off the wrong impression that ETH now has the ability for devs to arbitrarily change any addresses they want, which is completely false.

The 1MB limit is both artificial *and* meant to be temporary.
Imagine you go to a car dealership to purchase a brand new Ferarri... After driving off the lot, you then take it out to the highway and floor the gas pedal. The car will accelerate to about 80 or 90 MPH, and then it will stay there. Even though the 500 horsepower engine is capable of going faster, those supercars have speed limiters required by law that limit the engine to highway speeds. Without that speed limiter, the car can go much faster, maybe 180 or 190 MPH. Removing the speed limiter does not make the car capable of infinite speed. Neither does removing the 1MB limit make bitcoin capable of processing an unlimited number of transactions.
The 1MB limit was placed there in the early days to keep the blockchain small. In the early days there was no lightweight wallets, so everybody had to run a full node. Now that there are multiple lightweight wallet available to use, and the Blockchain is over 100GB, there is no reason to keep the chain limited.

I don't think it "proves" anything. That one hard fork is the only hardfork that resulted in two currencies. Every single other hard fork by every single currency that has performed one has gone fine.

I remember back in the day, this topic would come up every other day. Every time, the consensus was "lets all use bits, thats the best unit". I was never a fan of "bits" and I'm glad the reddit hivemind is against bits now.
My preferred solution to the unit problem is to always show 8 decimal places, even if the last few decimal place are zeros. For instance:
Could be read as "2 bitcoins, and one hundred thousand, three hundred satoshis". Without the trailing zeroes, it would be hard to tell how many satoshi's there are.
"Ninety six thousand one hundred fourty satoshis". At today's exchange rate, roughly 1000 satoshi's make up a penny, so 96K satoshi's are roughly 96 cents.

Big blockers want more than a single one time hard fork to raise the blocksize. They want the blocks to continually be raised until technical matters make it so the blocksize can't be lifted anymore. BIP101, Classic and Unlimited are about more than just a one time increase.
Small blockers have the vision that blocksize may be increased in the short term, but eventually will be limited by rules imposed by developers, even if the reality is that the network can handle more.
The difference between the two view points is in how the future is envisioned. So no, core are not "big blockers"

The fact of the matter is, that segwit doesn't allow more people to transact, it only allows the same number of people to transact, but with bigger transactions. When big blockers say they want bigger blocks, they say that because they want more people to be able to transact without the fee rising. Segwit simply doesn't allow for that. The only people who will have their fees decreased are those who use multisig.
Ironically, once Schnorr signatures land, that multi-sig discount goes away because Schnorr multi sigs are the same size as single sig witnesses.

You have it backwards, more users decreases centralization.


The quickest and safest way is to adopt another client which shall not be named.


You heard wrong. The only people that will get that kind of fee discount are multisig transactions which are a very tiny minority of transactions on the network. The non-witness part of the transaction (which is the majority of the space a transaction takes up) still has to be placed in the normal section of a block which is still limited to 1MB, and has to compete with other transactions made by non-segwit wallets. The typical wallet users will have probably less than 10% discount on fees once segwit activates. As more people adopt segwit, the discount may rise to 20%, but if non-segwit wallets also start increasing on the network, that eats into the segwit discount and it may actually decrease.

Because the increase in capacity is worth it. The dangers of a hard fork are completely overblown.
@_date: 2016-11-28 16:41:29


Not true. If a miner makes a block that is too big, that block will get orphaned by the network and the miner gets nothing.


Its only near zero because the maximum block size of 1MB is so tiny, there is little difference in propagation between 1MB and 100KB. When blocks get to be 100MB or more, then the marginal cost to include a single TX will *not* be near zero, because size will start to affect propagation speeds.

I consider it vaporware because it's been talked about so much for so long without ever being released. I'll change my mind when I see one of the implementations finished and ready to use. Just because there is a repository with code in it does mean people are working on it, but doesn't mean a finished product will necessarily come out of it.
If satoshi had made many blog posts and reddit posts in 2008 talking about how he's working on a revolutionary decentralized money system that will change the world I would have been just as sceptical. In 2009 when he released his work, my mind would have been changed.
I am a software developer myself, and I know it is possible to come up with an idea that you can't actually implement fully. Just because you can picture it in your head does not mean it can become reality. Tesla's "Wireless Energy Transmission" system reminds me of lightning network. Tesla spent the entire second half of his life trying to come up with a system to deliver power from the power station to the end user's house without using a wire. He died before ever finishing. I predict everybody working on LN implementations will either die or give up before finishing a working product. I consider a working product something that can be used in a commercial setting, not something that can be used on a testnet.

It depends on how it's implemented. If it's truly open source, then it should be easy for somebody to modify the code to make it appear that they are Joseph Miller, and the network would not know any better.
Decentralization comes from being designed as decentralized. Centralization comes from being designed as centralized. A system doesn't switch from being one to the other easily. It requires massive redesigns.
The very definition of closed source is that parts of a system are "centralized" to a single owner who does not share with anyone else.

@_date: 2016-11-11 04:09:27
There is no dire need. The problem is that you and the core devs refuse to raise the maximum blocksize limit. As long as the blocksize limit is stuck at 1MB, bitcoin has no future. Its not about capacity, it's about enforcing the right way of thinking, and that is always keeping the maximum blocksize limit above the actual amount of transactions on the network. Segwit is not an acceptable scaling solution because the "effective blocksize" is still lower than the amount of transactions being created by the network. The network should *never* be artificially constrained, and with segwit it still is.

Calling bittorrent "not decentralized" is playing word games. The mechanism that bittorrent survives on is the same principle that bitcoin survives on. The RIAA and MPAA have a higher incentive to make bittorrent extinct than any government has to make bitcoin extinct. The reason why the RIAA/MPAA have not been successful is because taking down bittorrent trackers is like a game of whack-a-mole. The same occurs in bitcoin. If governments try to shut down bitcoin nodes, the Streisand Effect will kick in and more nodes will pop up. New nodes can pop up for the same reason new bittorrent trackers can pop up: they are open source.

Wallets do not need to be upgraded when the maximum blocksize increase happens. I am 100% sure of this. Wallets have nothing to do with blocks. If some rule regarding blocks changes it is completely transparent to the wallets. All wallets care about is inputs and outputs. Blocks only pertain to nodes and miners.
By the way, you need to understand the difference between "adoption" that requires writing code, and adoption that requires upgrading to a new version. Segwit required writing code for everybody, including wallets and miners. A maximum blocksize limit doesn't require *anyone* to write *any* code, all anyone has to do is upgrade to the newest version of node software that accepts larger blocks.


The only way they will diverge is with coinbase transactions. Miners who mine on one chain will not be able to transact on the other chain. People who hold coins that were mined before the fork will have their transaction recorded on both sides of the split.


The only people who suffer are those who refuse to switch to the newer chain by mining the chain with the old rules, or those who buy coin from a miner who mines the chain with the old rules. Regular people won't even know a split has happened.

How do you know this? The way I see it, decentralization is quite good these days. Actually it always is good, no matter what because decentralization is not subject to day-to-day fluctuations. "Decentralization" comes from the design of the system along with the fact that it is completely open source. Node count has nothing to do with it. Nor does "cost to run a node".
Theoretically, lets say the node count quadrupoles tomorrow. According to you this would make bitcoin better, what I want to know is how? In what ways does it make bitcoin better?
My position is that this has absolutely no effect on bitcoin whatsoever. The system is exactly the same no matter how many nodes there are. I started using bitcoin when there were like 20,000 nodes, now there are about 5000. As far as I can tell, the system works exactly the same before as it does now.
Under attack conditions, node count matters, but there are no attacks being ran against bitcoin at this time. If a country starts attacking bitcoin (which I highly doubt will ever happen), *then* more nodes will make the system function better. During peacetime conditions, more nodes have zero effect. Its like having massive amount of soldiers in your army is a good thing during wartime, but during peacetime having too many soldiers isn't necessarily a good thing.

Security is subjective, so it's hard to say. Some will say SPV is never secure, others will say it is just as secure as full node wallets. The whitepaper doesn't really describe anything, like I said, the SPV section is pretty much jibberish. I have theorized that satoshi wrote the code for bitcoin before writing the whitepaper (hence most of the whitepaper being coherent), but wrote the SPV section of the whitepaper before any code was written to implement SPV. Any whitepaper what is written before the code is usually jibberish (other examples being LN/Mumblewumble/tumblebit, etc). Bip37 was an attempt to make the concept of SPV into working code. BIP37 is very developer unfriendly, because to use it you have to participate in the handshake process that nodes use to communicate with one another.


Because the actual idea of SPV as it's written in the whitepaper is vague and impossible to build anyways. For instance Satoshi talks about if a node see's an invalid block it'll send out a "fraud alert", but he doesn't explain how this fraud alert can be done in a way that's not an obvious DDOS vector.


The wallet I built is called MultiExplorer, and uses a method called moneywagon, which I also built. Moneywagon uses multiple blockexplorer API's in a roundrobin fashion. I also built one called Autotip, which uses the same moneywagon method.

Block size is dependant on how many users are using the network. It lots of people use the network, then blocks need to be bigger. If less people use bitcoin, then blocks can be smaller. Blocksize *limits* are central planning and have the result of making it impossible for more people to use the network.

The raising transaction fee does not rise smoothly. The optimal fee to get in the next block changes with volatility. You might publish a TX now with $0.15 fee, but 2 minutes later a bunch of TX's rush onto the network, increasing the mandatory fee to $0.25. Now your TX has too small of a fee and won't get into the next block. It may not get in for another 10 blocks or more. By the way, segwit will not increase capacity by much at all. Total impact on fee rates depends on all users switching to segwit, which won't happen for a long time.

In the cryptocurrency world, a system is either 100% working, or 0% working. There is no value in systems that are mostly working.

Bitcoin Classic's ultimate goal wasn't to just raise the blocksize to 2MB. The goal was to adopt the philosophy that the capacity the network can handle should *always* be greater than the amount of transactions made by users. The 2MB bump was just the beginning (the result of a compromise), the intent was for it to continually be bumped to 4MB, 8MB, etc. Segwit is just a single one time bump to slightly less than 2MB capacity. The "big blockers" want capacity to continually rise, segwit does not give that.

There is no such thing as a "small miner". There may have been back in the day, but in 2016 they don't exist. Everyone who mines does it through a pool. If the pool you are using has bad bandwidth, then simply use another pool. If you're a pool and your bandwidth is not enough to keep up, then you either get better bandwidth, or you perish. Why should the entire network be restricted because some tiny pools can't get their act together by getting fast enough internet?

It all depends on how it's implemented. I strongly suspect it is impossible to build a cryptocurrency that is *completely* open source *and* is written such that there can be one and only one miner. Just because the developers say that there can only be one miner, doesn't mean the code they actually wrote works that way. For instance, 42coin claims to only have 42 coins, but there are actually about 55. Its likely that your mechanism for achieving this has a flaw. So even though your JMcoin claims to be centralized, it may actually be decentralized.
You might say "I'll just make it so that a special key is required to mine, and only I have the key". But the code to generate that key is not open source, and therefore your JMcoin is not completely open source, but rather partially open source. Bitcoin is completely open source.
The concept of *completely* open source and *partially* open source is somewhat foreign to the cryptocurrency space, unfortunately. For instance the Jaxx wallet claims to be open source, but it's actually only partially open source. You can't make your own build of Jaxx, not without writing the missing code that Jaxx doesn't publish.

Some portion of the ethereum community did not agree on this issue, and so they made their own network. Its only a problem is you are part of the leadership of ethereum (hence it's political). From the perspective of the end user, the ethereum fork played out exactly as you could hope to expect.

What work is there to do? It's pretty much common sense that a larger amount of data takes longer to download than a smaller amount of data. It is also common knowledge that the longer it takes for a block to be downloaded and validated is directly related to orphan rate. If the blocksize limit were to be removed today, I guarantee you with 100% certainty that if I made a 1GB block, the network would orphan that block.


What exactly is a "small miner"? Either you own a multi-million dollar mining farm, and can also afford high speed internet, or you are a solo miner that uses a pool. If the pool doesn't have good bandwidth, then you should use one that has better internet.

Forget 1GB blocks, lets say I publish a 1TB block. I *am* certain that more that 50% of the network will not be able to download that block and fully validate even if they get a lucky streak and get a full 40 minutes to try. Even if the block was, say 10MB, and there *was* a chance it will get accepted, the chance is not 0, and therefore I would think long and hard before publishing a block that might be too large, since it's so expensive to mine a block in the first place.
By the way, why would I orphan my own block? If another block has a greater POW, I will orphan my own block. It's a common fallacy that one can't orphan their own block. This is a misconception, and there is nothing preventing anyone from orphaning their own block.

@_date: 2017-01-22 03:08:04
Changing the block size limit denominated in bytes to a blocksize limit denominated in outputs is compatible with all wallets in a way segwit isn't. Another way to fix the quadratic hashing problem without segwit is to add a rule that limits the amount of inputs to a single transaction. This problem only really is a problem when the entire block is a single transaction. The rule should have the effect that all inputs spent in the block has to be part of multiple distinct transactions. Another approach is to define a minimum transaction count rule. For instance, all blocks must contain at least 4 transactions.

Yes there is. If blocks were big enough to empty out the mempool every block, blocks would be slightly bigger than 1MB. Hard drives can easily fit that.
Satoshi never artificially constrained the network capacity. When the 1MB limit was put in place, blocks were like under 1KB.

It would still be wrong. "Network health" is determined by quality of operation, not number of nodes. The network right now is not the healthiest it's ever been because service quality has been degraded. This "fee market" nonsense is making payments delayed and its making them cost more than they need to be. It has nothing to do with node quantity.


I don't have to trust others, I can cross check with multiple block explorers. If 100% of known block explorers say my payment is valid, then I can know my payment is valid. I don't have to trust any one block explorer. Even if you run a full node you have to trust that all of the miners are not colluding together.
If your "centralization pressure" concept as correct, then you'd see it in other distributed systems like SMTP, HTTP, NTP, BitTorrent, etc, but you don't. No one ever whines that there aren't enough BitTorrent trackers and its making Bittorrent "centralized". No one ever says that NTP is becoming "centralized" because there are less nodes than there were the day before. Those systems base "network health" on quality of service.
In the Bitcoin system, all nodes do is add redundancy. The only accurate way to describe decreasing nodes in bitcoin is to say "redundancy reduction pressure"

In the case of Dogecoin's hard fork, it was to remove the issuance cap, essentially creating an infinitely inflating currency. It played out much like the ETH hard fork.

This is only possible for wllets that use the traditional "anonymous node SPV". If your wallet is using "trusted SPV" or "moneywagon SPV" then this is not a problem.
Basically, all "SPV wallets" these days are built using APIs like bitpay insight or blockr.io. If your wallet uses the bitpay insight, then your wallet is always seeing the same blockchain that bitpay uses. Do you trust bitpay to be on the right side of a fork? If they aren't on the right side, then who will be?
As long as your wallet communicates with it's blockchain service through HTTPS, nobody can send you junk data to mess up your wallet unless they hack bitpay's service. That is where the trust part comes in, but if you don't trust bitpay's security, there is also Toshi, blockcypher, smartbitau, blockstrap, coinprism, chain.so, etc.

 feel like the only way to get past this blocksize debate is to take some of the fear associated with hard forks. I feel like a huge source of disagreement is people misunderstanding of what a hard fork is. Thank you Mike Hearn for writing this article.
Let me get this straight. A "hard fork" is what occurs when a change to the protocol is deployed that is not backwards compatible with existing nodes. A change to the protocol that *does not* break backwards compatibility, is not a fork at all, but commonly referred to as a "soft fork".
Is it possible to make a bunch of changes to the bitcoin protocol to "tighten" up the rules such that soft forks are impossible? It seems to be the only reason why "soft forking changes" (that is to say changes that don't result in a fork) are even possible is because some of the bitcoin code is ambiguous enough to allow quite a lot of "wiggle room".

The real winner is "larger than 1MB blocks" which is leading with +80% of the vote.

Mining centralization is a non-problem. As long as the central mining powers don't abuse their power, the fact that most mining is done by a small number of people is moot. If the majority of users don't give a shit about mining centralization. Sort of like how the majority of people don't care about the dollar being centralized. If most people don't care, then it's effect on "network value" is zero.

I think 75% is good enough for a fork. At least there is a clear majority. The worst case scenario is a 50-50 split. Sort of like the 2000 election where Gore and Bush both had pretty much 50% of the vote each. In that case, 'the system' kicked in and they were able to do recounts until a winner was selected. Bitcoin has no such 'system' since it's decentralized, so a 50-50 divided community has no mechanism to pick a winner.
The losing 25% are strongly incentivized to upgrade their nodes or they risk losing money. It doesn't make sense that someone would continue keeping the old chain going.

You think bitpay is going to accept bitcoin-1MB? No way. Nor will anyone else. The only people who will use bitcoin-1MB are the extreme libertarian nutbag wing of the bitcoin community. None of these coins will be traded because none of the major exchanges will accept it. I can see maybe a few minor exchanges trading it, but the greater community will pay as much attention to it as they pay to any random altcoin.

You could lock down the protocol by changing the code so that is only accepts the most strictest variance in block data. For instance any part of the code that uses a regular expression like "\w{3,4}" should be rewritten so that is looks like "(one|two|three)" (or whatever). That way, *any* change to the way the software makes a block needs to go through hard fork. The only reason why non-forking changes are possible is because of shortcuts put into the code that allow variances (at least thats my impression). 
edit: I thnk it would be very hard to make bitcon locked so that soft forks are impossible simple because it's rules have changed quite a bit over time. You could make a new altcoin called ImmutableCoin that is a fork of bitcoin, and modified so that it only accepts the most strictest set of inputs possible.

Autotip works this way. All transactions are created with a $0.01 USD fee. If the price goes up the fee goes up, if the price goes down the fee goes down. It works pretty well, but obviously sometimes when a stress test is going on it can take a while for the transaction to confirm.

Only miners and full nodes need to stay on the bleeding edge, regular end user wallets don't need to know about protocol changes.
These kinds of protocol changes don't happen too often. When they do happen it is for good reason. Bip66 needed to happen, and so does the block size fork. 
No wallet security was compromised unless you're a darknet market or Bitpay. If you're a regular user transacting with other users in a trusted environment, then there was no failure of security.

The most secure way to store bitcoins long term is a paper wallet. Seriously, don't mes with all those gidgets and gizmos, the chance that they will fuck up is much less than trusty ol' paper wallets. If you're the kind of person who is not a computer power user then you probably should do the whole "unplug your computer, disconnect from the internet", but if you know what you're doing, you can just use bitaddress.org.
One way to do it is to use bip38 when you generate your paper wallet. Then you can email the private key and public key to your brother or uncle or whoever, then call them on the phone to tell them the password. That way if their email gets compromised, all they will see is the bip38 encoded private key, which they can't use unless they have the password, which you sent through another channel. Also, make sure you keep the public key so you can "watch" the balance via a "wallet watcher" utility.
Not to be an armchair psychologist, but I think your desire to constantly test your solution will go away after you have more experience handling bitcoin. When I first got into bitcoin I felt nervous moving around bitcoins, because I was afraid I might mess something up and lose everything. After handling around bitcoins for 2 years now, I no longer feel any anxiety over sweeping, making transactions and everything else bitcoin related.

First off, when these forking alerts are issued, a disclaimer needs to be included that if you are not transacting, you are not vulnerable.
In essence, the only danger to there being a temporary blockchain fork is that the window of opportunity to perform a double spend attack is increased. If you're holding bitcoin and are not sending transactions to the network, you have nothing to worry about.
The alerts issued by the subreddit moderators should do a better job of describing who is affected and who is not affected. Just saying "everybody needs to wait 30 confirmations" is overstating the situation and inadvertently causing people to panic.

Honestly, I don't see there being any more new big name developers moving forward. At least not for bitcoin core. Most likely we'll see new bitcoin implementations like XT which will have developers working on their own outside of core. If you're the kind of developer who just wants to build code, then you'll start your own project. If you're the kind of person who is better with people skills and networking skills and things like that, you're more likely to want to join an existing project. Its not enough to just write some code, make a pull request and expect that PR to get merged. The reality is that for a project like core, for every one hour spent programming, you need to spend another 4 hours on IRC/maling list trying to get other people to look over your code. Why bother with all that when you can just start your own project if all you wanted to do is build something?

The weakness of "SPV wallets blindly following the longest chain" Peter Todd talks about is only a problem with wallets using the old-fashioned SPV method. "Moneywagon style SPV" does not have this problem: 
Essentially, moneywagon lets you specify explicitly which "side" you want to be on when or if a hard fork were to occur. That way if a fork were to happen, and the real hashrate difference between the two forks is close to 50/50, your wallet will not have the problem of confusing the two forks.

Even better idea: allow for a new transaction type where you can define the inputs to a transaction with a simple "list comprehension" syntax.
So instead of writing a transaction with 100 inputs and the tx being really large (because you have to list each one indicidually), you could write that same tx by saying "all inputs like this one" and it would be considerably less size. This would incentivize adding all possible inputs to all transactions, hence lessening the overall amount of utxos, as well as making it more economical to spend smaller utxos.

The reason why these forks happen is because not 100% of full nodes upgrades to the newest change all at the same time. Even when 95% of the network has the newest code, that other 5% will cause these "mini forks" until the straggler miners get up to speed.
If only 50% of the network upgraded, the situation would be much much worse. The best case scenario is everybody upgrades at the exact same time. If that were to happen, there would be no disruption at all. Getting 100% of the network to upgrade at the same time is pretty much impossible. No matter what, any change in the consensus code will result in series of "mini forks" like what were seeing now. This is not a terrible thing in my opinion, since only a few people are affected by these mini forks.

The heart of the blocksize debate is one of personal philosophy. One one side you have the big-blockists, and on the other side there are small-blockists.
Small-blockists tend to be more libertarian, while the big blockists are less libertarian (maybe post-libertarian?).
In the early days of bitcoin, the community was heavily libertarian, so most *early* early adopters tend to be small-blockists. These people see "being your own bank", or rather running your own node as the most important aspect of bitcoin. Any change to bitcoin that makes it harder to run your own node is not something that should never happen. Most of these people don't use SPV out of philosophical reasons, not do they use anything other than bitcoin core. These people also don't care if bitcoin is a worldwide currency, as long as they can use it they are happy. They also feel that bitcoin's architecture is fundamentally flawed so that it will never be able to handle the scale of the world's population so why bother?
On the other hand the big-blockists don't see being your own bank as the most important aspect of bitcoin. These people are more likely to use a light weight wallet that relies on an external blockchain service to function. If you got into bitcoin in 2013 or later, you are more likely to be a big-blockist. These people want bitcoin to be a worldwide currency that a worldwide population everybody can use it. They also feel that bitcoin's architecture is *not* fundamentally flawed and that all thats needed for worldwide adoption is to increase the block limit.
Small blockists seem to be a small number of highly influential individuals in the bitcoin world. The mod of is a small-blockist, as well as some of the most outspoken developers. For the most part, the "unwashed masses" of bitcoin users tend to be big-blockists.

The SPV mining argument is pure bullshit. It takes 10 minutes to verify a block. It takes nowhere near that long to verify a block of transactions. Not unless you're mining on a raspberry pi.
If a miner is mining blocks without verifying the transactions first, that miner is only screwing themselves over. At some point a non-SPV mining node is going to see that the block is invalid, henceforth orphaning every block they make.

Address re-use is really not that much of an important thing. Its good practice to not reuse addresses, but its not like you're at any serious risk if you don't.
Basically if you don't reuse addresses, all your transactions are publicly "linked" to you through the blockchain. I put quotation marks around linked because the resulting link is very weak and can't really be used for much. What good is a link if there is a question mark at both ends. So what you know that 13Fsa2... transacted with 162cD3... You still don't know who the owner of those two addresses are.

You don't need to "validate transactions" if you're just a wallet. All you need to do is make transactions, sign them, and push them to the network. Full nodes and miners do the validating. Maybe back in 2010 when bitcoin was tiny your only option was to validate transactions yourself, but in 2015 the situation is much different. My personal opinion is that you can trust the "block explorer ecosystem" as much as you could trust blocks coming to you straight from the bitcoin network.

In my opinion, the "mining centralized" argument is just as much a fallacy as the "fee pressure" one is.
Increasing the blocksize will mean a more quickly growing blockchain, but the over all effect on miners and full nodes is very small. It is very trivial for a node operator to install another hard drive. Especially when you consider most miners these days are huge datacenter operations.
Its sort of like trickle-down economics. I'm sure if you spend enught time, you can find a small number of situations where wealthy people are trickling down their wealth to the lower class, but overall the effect is not there.
I'm sure if you look long enough you'll find a miner who will stop mining because the blockchain is too big, but the overwhelming majority of miners will adapt and it will have no overall effect.

At it heart, mining is a game. Sort of like Magic The Gathering or baseball. The result of this game being played is the creation of this thing called the blockchain. Sort of like how the result of a baseball being played results in a [score card]( A baseball score card is used to archive what happened in a baseball game. A blockchain is used to record economic activity that makes up the currency. Each baseball game is composed of 9 innings, but bitcoin mining is composed of one "mining round" that lasts every 10 minutes. Each mining round results in a winner, who gets a 25 BTC award, and the privilege of determining what gets written next to the blockchain.
It has to take 10 minutes of heavy computation in order for the game to work properly. Think of the game hide and go seek. One person closes their eyes and counts to 100 while everyone else goes and hides. If the person counting counts very fast, then by the time they go looking for the other players, they may not have finished hiding yet. The counter has to count slowly enough in order for the game to work. In bitcoin mining, each round has to last 10 minutes or else every block will get solved immediately. The "difficulty" mechanism ensures that it takes 10 minutes for each round. You can't just tell players to "wait to minutes between rounds" because there is no way to enforce that rule. Imagine a hide and seek game where instead of counting to 100, the person does 100 seconds of math problems.
As long as the game is being played, the blockchain will continue to exist, and the bitcoin currency can use it to be a currency. If the bitcoin game stops, that is to say everyone on the planet decided that mining is not something they want to do anymore, then bitcoin will end. As long as their are some people playing the game, the currency will continue.
All it takes to be a player in the mining game is to install the bitcoin mining software on a computer you own.

I use AWS every day at work, and I use a similar service for personal projects called Digital Ocean (which is slightly cheaper than AWS). Pretty much every major computing project now-a-days is ran from such cloud provider. Bitcoin can be ran through these cloud providers as well. The VPS server I run 4 personal projects from cost me $15 a month.

Only if you put multiple address in the same API call will BC.i be able to link those two addresses together. If you make a single call with a single address, *and* you do it through TOR, the service will not be able to link them together.
Have you ever looked at web server logs? Each line represents a single page view (or API call in this instance) and includes a timestamp, ip address, the url, and some other stuff like useragent string. Its possible to interact with BC.i's API in such a way that BC.i's server logs do not contain any information that links any of your addresses together. The referrer address will be an exit node.If you didn't use TOR the logs would show that two seperate calls came from the same address, therefore the owners of those two addresses are the same. If the ip address is an exit node, that conclusion can't be made.
If you used the API in such a way that you included multiple addresses in the same call, eg:
then those two addresses will be linked together since they came from the same caller. If you split them into multiple calls:
then the calls will appear in the log in two different lines and will appear to be from two different entities especially if the origin address is a tor exit node.

It *can* offer a doubling immediately. It only *will* offer a doubling if 100% of the network upgrades. Most likely less than 100% of wallets will make segwit transactions, so it won't wuite be a doubling. When LTC or some other altcoin activates segwit, we will see just how many segwit transactions get mined, to get an idea of how fast transaction creators upgrade.

Yes, and that advise wields a lot of power. There are a bunch of miners who want a hard fork to raise the blocksize limit, but only want it if it comes from Core. If core announces a date when a hard fork will be attempted, the debate is over.
Also, you must differentiate the difference between the idea behind a hard fork, and the implementation behind an idea. It is not true that an idea can be "unsafe, poorly designed and rushed", only that can be said of an implementation. If you think classic is "unsafe, poorly designed and rushed" then why not write your own implementation of a hard fork that isn't "unsafe, poorly designed and rushed"?

Not true. If you run any walle behind TOR, you have privacy. Even using blokchain.info wallet directly behind TOR is about as private as humanly possible in 2015.


Not true either. You don't need to push transactions through TOR at all to be private. You can push them through the clear net, because any node you give your transaction to has no way of knowing if that transaction was made by you, or if you are just relaying someone else's transaction.

I don't agree. Just because there are few nodes doesn't mean censorship is inevitable. In order to successfully censor bitcoi, you need to control 100% of the nodes. Its true its easier to control 5 than it is to control 5000, but controlling 5 nodes is still very hard. As soon as word got out that an entity is attempting to take over, the Streisand effect takes over, and more nodes appear.
Even though it may get to a point where it requires a data center to run a bitcoin node, it is getting easier and easier to do that thanks to technological advancements.

You spin up a server on AWS. Install bitcoind, which downloads the entire blockchain. You can also install electrum-server on this server, and run electrum client on your home machine. You are still trustless (not "SPV") because you are trusting a node ran on hardware you control (on the cloud). A full node wallet is the exact same thing, a wallet ran off a node you run on your own hardware.

Actually, if a fork persists, it'll be longer than 100 blocks before mixing occurs. When you buy BTC from a source like coinbase or circle, the coin you get is not usually recently mined. It'll take probably a few months before post-fork coin starts to get mixed into any large amount of circulating coins.
During a persisting fork, post-fork coin will be nearly worthless until the fork resolves. Pre-fork coins will work perfectly (as long as both ledgers get all transactions) and should not experience any price fluctuations.

ECC is what keeps bitcoin wallets secure. It doesn't matter if you're using a full node wallet or a lightweight wallet, the ECC is the same. "Nodiness" has nothing to do with it.
What you're saying is like saying "its more secure to have a hot tub in your living room". You can't steal a wallet's private key through the node aspect of a wallet, anymore than you can gain access to someone's house through the hot tub.
If running a full node is more secure than a lightweight wallet then you should be able to set up an experiment through the scientific method that confirms this result. How would you go about confirming the hypothesis that full node wallets are more secure through experimentation?


Not true. You can use blockexplorer's via TOR to get your balance, and achieve the same non-linking privacy effect. You check one address's balance using one API through TOR, and then check another address using another API through TOR. Now even is a government has access to both services's logs, there is no way to link the two addresses.

Multiexplorer works in a way similar to tor. If you believe tor to be "secure enough", then you should also believe multiexplorer to be similarly "secure enough" because they both work on the same high level premise.

Um, no. What happens after segwit get merged in, and we reach the 2MB capacity later on? Segwit's "capacity increase" stops at a 2MB. After you segregate the witness, theres nothing left to segregate. With the blocksize increase, when 2MB is not enough anymore, you can increase to 4, then 8, then 20, then 50, etc. Segwit stops at 2MB...

Any fork in the bitcoin blockchain effects the network in that it makes it easier to perform a "double spend attack". Not every transaction is even a candidate for a double spend, so the warning in bright orange telling everyone to wait for 30 confirmations is hyperbole.
If you're accepting money from untrusted senders, you are advised to wait until 30 confirmations. If you only accepting money from trusted sources (coinbase, your friend, anyone you trust) then you have nothing to worry about. If you are only holding a balance and not sending any transactions, you are also completely safe.

Hashpower support implies economical support. Miners know who they sell their newly minted coins to. For instance, if a miner uses coinbase to cash out *and* coinbase has indicated that it *will* support the 2MB chain (which they have), then that miner will probably vote for the 2MB "hard upgrade".
On the other hand, if a miner uses some other service to cash out, and that service has indicated that it will *not* follow the 2MB chain, then that miner will probably *not* vote for 2MB.

Its not a choice. If your wallet supports seqwit, the transactions you make with that wallet are segwit. If the developers of your wallet have not yet gotten around to supporting segwit, then your transactions are not segwit. If a significant portion of the network has not upgraded to support segwit either, then blocks will be filled with transactions in proportion to adoption.
At any rate, the reduction in fees for segwit transactions is very little. The signature is 72 bytes, and a typical transaction is 250 bytes. Thats a reduction of 28%. The current fee is what 10 cents? Saving 28% on fees amounts to a savings of 2.8 cents. Are you going to bother switching wallets to a segwit enabled wallet to save 2.8 cents per transaction?

Linking will only happen if you include multiple address into the same call.

If you're using TOR, from the service's perspective, all calls will be coming from the same TOR exit node.
Also, packet sniffing has nothing to do with TOR. If you're communicating across HTTPS, you are safe from packet sniffing, TOR or not. TOR gives you anonymity so that from the service's perspective, you can't be located. HTTPS gives you encryption so that anyone along the way between you and the service API, can't read your packets.

The AD parameter only comes into play if a miner makes a block bigger than some portion of the network can handle. If a miner makes a block that is rejected for any other reason, AD does not come into play.
During normal operating conditions, EB most likely will be set to much higher than blocks are being made anyways, so AD should hardly ever come into play anyways. For instance, today it takes 1.1 MB blocks (or thereabouts) to clear the mempool every block. If the 100% of the network signals EB8, then it is very unlikely AD will never come into play, as there is no need for a block to be the size anywhere near what everyone sets EB.

Not true. Al the stuff that "scales" bitcoin without touching the blocksize only amounts to a very small increase, less than 2X. The only way to get massive improvements to capacity is to raise the blocksize limit.
Imagine this thought experiment. You have an electric drill. You can open up the drill and with a screwdriver and solder iron, you can tweak around the insides to get the drill bit to spin more faster. You can't tweak the internals to get 10x improvement, but you can get 10 or 15%. The only way to get 5x or 10x is to increase the power going into the drill. Segwit, Schnorr, and MASTS are all tweaks that add a very tiny amount of capacity. The only ay to get massive improvements is to raise the blocksize limit.

Each time the price does a "dance move" for lack of a better term, then drops to a lower price point, where it does the next move, etc.

When a full node makes a transaction, its true that they don't need to ask anyone else for UTXO data, but they *do* have to send that transaction to the rest of the network. This effectively broadcasts the exact same information as your theoretical SPV wallet asking about UTXO data.

The word "tip" in this context refers to a slightly different thing than what you'd see someone do in a restaurant.
The Autotip/Protip concept of a tip is more like those newspaper vending machines that are sometimes still used:
You put in a coin, then take out the paper. You can also take out two papers and only pay for one. The product here is very cheap is it doesn't make sense to waste a lot of resources to enforce that each person pays.

You know, when you make a post to reddit, the back end server has to store that comment somewhere. A reddit comment is not too many bytes larger than a bitcoin transaction.

Some altcoins are legitimate, but Neucoin isn't one of them. I read their whitepaper, its basically 40 pages of technical jargon, that goes nowhere.

This can be somewhat easily done using Autotip as "the button". All you'd have to do is write a backend that handles sending the payout. Using Autotip solves the problem of knowing that the sending address is the correct payout address, as Autotip always reuses addresses.
You could also limit all submissions to inputs hat are older than a certain block age. That way you're limiting one press per bitcoin address effectively.

Its not anti-Bitcoin to "rely on a third party". It's anti-bitcoin to be forced to rely on a single 3rd party. When it comes to choosing a 3rd party for bitcoin transaction validation, you have blockr.io, smartbit.com.au, blockchain.info, blockchains.io, and on and on and on...
I think whether you should run your own node is dependent on your scale. If you're a betting site that needs to process a bllion payments a day, you probably are going to have a hard time finding an API that will handle that load. In that case you should run your own node and validate your own transactions.
On the other hand lets say you are a bakery and only expect to get a few people a day paying in bitcoin. In that case, you can probably get away with using blockchain.info for verifying payments.
@_date: 2015-09-05 17:27:57
The only reason anyone would ever run a full node is: 
1. If you're a bitcoin enthusiast who loves bitcoin and wants to run one 
2. You're a business that takes in bitcoin payments.
If you're a casual user, there is no reason for you to run a full node. By casual user I mean if you make &lt;100 transactions per day.
Bitcoin only needs enough nodes to serve the people who need nodes in the first place, which are exchanges and companies like bitpay. Home users get their blockchain data from the exchanges (via blockchain APIs that their lightweight wallets use).
If blocks are bigger, some home users may drop off, but bitcoin doesn't need these people in the first place.

I think you need to better define "hard"? To me its not hard at all to set up a full node, no matter what the size of the blockchain. I can afford a few hard drives and I know how to plug them in. Someone could set up a service where you get mailed to you a USB thumb drive with the blockchain already there so you don't even have to wait a long time for it to sync on first start.

This is the part I don't really get about ho lightning is supposed to work.
The way compression works is that it finds patterns in data and exploits those patterns to express the data in a way that uses less space. What kind of patterns are the lightning network looking for in the p2p transaction data to make it so much smaller? True p2p transaction is data that can't be compressed unless your compression is "lossy". My feeling is that *especially* since much of lightning network is not yet built, there are probably going to be tradeoffs that has not yet been discovered.
Sort of like how with jpegs you get your picture but with less space to store it, you have to deal with "jaggies" and degraded image quality as a tradeoff. What are the tradeoffs for lightning network's compression?

Casascius coins aren't used to "store" bitcoin. Thats not what they are.

I love casascius coins. I have two of them. One 2013 1BTC brass I bought in 2014 for about $500, and the other is a silver 2014 "Bitcoin Bowl". If the price of bitcoin goes up, then the casascius coins that have their holograms intact will go up as well. If you believe bitcoin is going to the moon, then why not try to pick one of these up as well?
One thing about hacked casascius coins: In my opinion, a hacked casascius coin is worth more than a non-hacked coin. Obviously if the balance that corresponds to the coin is empty, then the BTC balance is zero, but if the hologram is still intact, then the coin is still technically in mint condition. Since it takes a lot of skill to break one of these holograms without detection, there are likely to be very few in existence.
If anyone has a hacked casascius coin, I'd pay $1000 for one.

This is a big misconception. Have you ever heard of someone losing bitcoin because they were using an SPV wallet with reduced security? I never have. When you lose bitcoin, it is because someone screwed up (either the developers of your wallet, or you the wallet user)
The only security difference between SPV and full node is theoretical. An SPV wallet is more vulnerable to theoretical attacks. In real world terms they are exactly the same security wise.

Your definition of using bitcoin seems to be running a full node. My definition of using bitcoin is to be able to send a transaction. What good is running a full node if you can't make a transaction? In my opinion, the only reason why you'd ever need to run a full node is if you are an exchange or satoshidice or someone like that who takes in massive amounts of customer payments and withdraws. If you're a single user who makes one or two transactions a day, you don't need a full node wallet at all.
Mining is not important in my opinion either. I feel a lot of the incentives associated with mining were really only needed to get bitcoin off the ground. Even if there were a massive mining industry collapse, bitcoin will still survive because there are too many wealthy holders who are invested in the blockchain surviving to let it just die. If mining was removed entirely and replaced with Proof of Stake that would be even better.

But its more than just simply going up and going down. You can clearly see a "shape" form each time the price sees a new floor. Each "shape" (I realize calling it a 'dance move' is dumb) seems to have a character distinct from the previous, and *in progressively less aggresive manner*.

Do you really want me to answer this question? The theoretical throughput of the network 2 years ago was 3 TPS. the actual throughput of the network today is 3TPS. Let me ask you the same question, what *has* the devs been doing for the past 3 years? Certainly not providing results.


Bitcoin being decentralized is what makes it redundant. Satoshi is who made Bitcoin decentralized, not anyone involved in development today. The current core developers have done nothing but post reddit rants and write whitepapers.


It doesn't have to be exactly 100% uptime, but it has to be as close as possible. Imagine if 50% of the time you tried to use your VISA card it didn't work? You wouldn't use VISA any more. These days even if you use the optimal fee your bitcoin wallets recommends for you, you still may only get a confirm after 1 block 50% of the time (the rest of the time you experience long delays). If you are going to the store to buy things and you knew the chances of your card working was 50/50, you wouldn't bother using your card anymore.


Back before blocks were full this was correct. Go back to 2011 or 2012 and you won't find a single complaint of a stuck transaction. It was only after blocks became full that people started experiencing delayed confirmations. If it takes one hour for your payment to go through when you wanted it to go through immediately, that is effectively downtime.

The realistic LN which may get built, but won't be something that everyone uses in place of Layer 1 BTC. At best some small usecases will adopt payment channel routing networks like LN, but it won't be something the entire network migrates to.

Segwit is not a blocksize increase, its an "effective" blocksize increase. The actual capacity increase won't be felt until a majority of users mone their funds into segwit addresses.

Zero-confirm is not zero-security. "No door" is not correct, maybe door with just a simple lock, as opposed to a huge 50 lbs. bolt.
You make it sound like anyone can trivially double spend a zero-confirm transaction. This is false. It is very difficult to double spend a transaction once it's been propagated across most of the network, which happens in under 10 seconds. The only way to do it consistently is to have a large miner willing to be your accomplice. A normal person paying $15 for a sandwich is not going to be able to double spend that transaction. The only time waiting for a confirmation is needed is when you're transacting large amounts where the cost of a double spend is economical.

My reply was a response to the idea that mining will "end" once mining crosses some threshold of "not profitable anymore". Even if the price were to drop and drop and people mining now cease to run their hardware, there will always be new people willing to jump in and mine bitcoins.
People who have very large amounts of money view their money fundamentally differently than people like you and me with normal amounts of money in the bank. My boss for instance comes from an extremely wealthy family. His parents own like 20 mansions and are always flying around the world. This guy owns the place where I work. Its a luggage store, and I know for a fact that it doesn't make a profit. Does that lead him to shut down the business? No way. He keeps it running because he enjoys running the store. He likes the people that work there, he likes the area, and he will keep it going no matter what. If this guy wanted to open another 10 luggage stores he could if he wanted to (but he's not a complete idiot so he won't do that until the one is profitable).
I feel like miners are in the same boat. The "corporate interests" that you speak of are people who don't mind taking losses year over year. What drives these people is being "king of bitcoin mining". What drives people to be president? What drives people to be sports stars? The same desire is what drives people to spend money on bitcoin mining hardware.

It depends on how you go tthe bitcin in the first place. If you received your bitcoin from a centralized source (such as buying from coinbase or any other exchange), then you pay very little in transaction fees because all of your transactions will draw from a single UTXO.
On the other hand, if you received that bitcoin from a de-centralized source, such as via 1000 people sending you a small tip, then your bitcoin is through multiple UTXOS, which results in gigantic transactions that cost a lot in fees. BIP131 (aka Wildcard Inputs) fixes this problem, but the current core developers are strongly against that proposal.

Segwit is only a one time "increase" in the blocksize limit. Once the witness has been segregated, you can't segregate it anymore. 1.7MB is the maximum amount of capacity that can be gained from segwit.

Yes this can be done right now with Autotip.
Thereis a bunch of different ways to monetize bit torrent seeders. One such was is as follows:
The torrent site would put a meta tag on the site that you download the torrent. So for instance, this page:  would have a meta tag, one for each seeder, and one for the original uploader. When a downloader lands on the download page, their autotip browser extension will send a small amount of bitcoin to all the seeders currently seeding the torrent. When a seeder drops out, their meta tag is removed from the page, and they no longer get tips from new downloaders. This way incentivises people to seed for a long time, but not necessarily to give a lot of bandwidth. Maybe the torrent website can experiment with the "data-ratio" value to correspond with how much bandwidth the peer is giving...

I don't think its right to assume miners are purely profit-driven and will shut off when profits suddenly dry up. "out of the goodness of their hearts" is not a too inaccurate description, either. Maybe "out of the enjoyment of their hobby" would be better.
I see people who own and operate bitcoin miners in the same way people used to own and operate trading card shops in the late 80s when sports card collecting was popular. It is very hard to be profitable running a card shop, but many of the people who ran them were dentists, lawyers, and the like doing the card shop as a side project. Having fun running the store was more important than making a profit from running the store. Bitcoin miners have fun building the hardware and being part of the system. The profits are just something that makes it more fun.

What you just described is not address reuse. Anyways, is it really the end of the world if people know how much you've been tipped? A lot of coffee shops I know in my area have a big "tips" jar on the counter that you can see how much previous customers have tipped. Those places don't seem to mind.
Address reuse referrs to the way wallets make transactions by sending change to another address each time. The result of doing this is that it makes it difficult to follow someone's purchases. My point is that not everybody needs to hide their money all of the time. Maybe *some people* need to hide their money all of the time, but not everybody.

My point is that it is a finite gain. Whatever the value ends up being. Raising the blocksize can be done any number of times.


Blocksize is not a critical limited resource. It isn't now at 1MB, and it probably won't be until there are enough people making transactions in order to make blocks 10MB or greater. Any person today knows that 1MB every 10 minutes is a tiny bit of bandwidth that anyone who can afford a mining rig can afford at home. My cell phone connection can handle 1MB every 10 minutes easily. There is no logical reason nor evidence to suggest that raising the blocksize limit will be "centralizing" to miners.
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:31:04
"IS" isn't the right word. Segwit *can* be a blocksize increase, but only if it i adopted by the wallet community. Its a probability curve that determines how much of a capacity increase will occur.
There is a very good chance that segwit' activation will be a 1% capacity increase, as that would only require a very tiny portion of the wallet community to switch to segwit. There is a slightly smaller probability that segwit will result in a 20% capacity increase. The probability that segwit will double capacity is very small, but still non-zero. In order for segwit to double capacity, 100% of the wallet community has to switch to segwit, that is very unlikely.

It was developed at the cost of the network. The core developers have said many times that a real blocksize increase should not happen because segwit provides the same capacity increase.

SPV to me means using bloom filters and block headers to verify utxos before including them into your transaction. All of my wallets have used blockexplorer APIs to get UTXOs, and assumed they are valid by virtue of the fact that multiple APIs are in agreement (there are over 20 block explorer APIs, and they always agree). SPV is vulnerable to sybil attack, blockexplorer APIs are not.

Except if a 2MB hard fork happens, capacity will *actually* be increased and transaction fees will drop significantly, that has value to the network and is worth the "cost".

In the case of a security breach, it is more important to know *how* something was breached, rather than *what* has been breached. What if your attacker has access to *all* 2000 servers? The fact that server  keys were used to steal the funds will incorrectly lead you to assume that server  is the cause of the leak, when indeed the cause of the leak was a compromised VPS server image.

Wen I tip you, I pay the fee for that tip. When you spend the tip I gave you, *you* have to pay the fee. If all your bitcoin is in small inputs, it becomes very expensive to use your bitcoin. Lets say you want to buy something that is 1BTC, and you got that 1 BTC by 1000 people sending you 0.001 BTC. The transaction you make will have 1000 inputs and will cost a shitload. On the other hand, if you got that 1BTC from a single centralized source, then your BTC is all in one input, and when you spend that 1BTC you will do it with a tiny transaction which is very cheap.

It is wrong to see malleability as strictly a bug in the bitcoin protocol. Who knows, maybe in the future a new thing will be developed that relies on malleability to work. In that context, malleability is a Good Thing^tm .
I consider malleability as just a prickly issue that developers building stuff on top of bitcoin need to be made aware of. That includes wallet developers, exchange developers, and so on. Pointer arithmetic  is also a prickly issue for programmers, but no one wants to remove pointer arithmetic from a language (I hope).
The truth is you can't lose money from a "malleability attack", unless you couple your attack with some social engineering mixed in.

I don't believe it. If anything, the amount of time it takes to verify a block has increased due to the fact that blocks are bigger. Anyways, you can't quantify something like that without mentioning the underlying hardware. Faster computers will spend less time validating the same block as compared to a slower computer. A faster hard drive will speed up validation more than implementing secp256k1 would have... Yes secp256k1 was 75 percent faster, but the code only spends 1% of it's time doing stuff that secp256k1 covers. The same goes for many of the things you core developers are doing. This is my biggest gripe with core. You guys are not doing the things that bitcoin *needs* you only want to do things that fall into your wheelhouses. What bitcoin needs is a blocksize increase, but what we get instead is stuff that you guys will enjoy building, but add very little to the overall picture.


What do you mean by "stop converging"? Are you implying that there is a certain point at which block are too big and the entire system stops working? This is the incorrect view that Mike Hearn took, and he is just as wrong as you are here. When blocks get too big for lesser performing machines to keep up, they will drop out, but there will always be computers that do have the resources to keep the system going. Bitcoin doesn't just run on one computer. Many computers taken together make up the network. The node count decreasing is not "centralizing". Centralizing implies bitcoin will become like Liberty Reserve. This is absurd. Bitcoin gets it decentralized nature from being open source and runnable on consumer hardware. Consumer Hardware includes VPS servers, which bitcoin full nodes will run on no matter what the blocksize limit is.

I think a better solution to the monetization to torrents is to implement autotip on the tracker website. That way each new downloader tip the existing set of seeds (which can be done with a single transaction to minimize fees). This way you can use any trrent cient you want, rather than have to switch to a separate client. Also you can tip  people that are using a different client. As far as I can tell joystream can only tip seeders who are also using joystream.

Do you also do all web browsing behind TOR? When you visit web pages, your IP is logged into the webserver's logs. This is the same thing that happens when you use a lightweight wallet. Other sites can see what your public key is, but they have to go digging through logs. The architecture of the wallet has nothing to do with private key security. There is this myth that using SPV that you seem to believe, that it is possible to lose money by using non-full node wallets. No such attack has ever been carried out. SPV is vulnerable to Sybil attack, but that doesn't result in you losing money, all it does is make your wallet not able to spend or see balance (but the money is still there)
If you're really so concerned about you privacy, you can use just about any wallet (full node/spv/API) privately by running it behind TOR.

You talk like this is so easy to pull off. If it were that simple, everyone would be doing it. Transactions propagate across the entire network in just a few seconds. Your window is so tiny, it'll only work very seldom. If you have a special relationship with a big miner, the chances are much easier. In the future when the majority of the network is using bitcoinxt, this attack will be even harder to pull off, as bitcoinxt relays double spends. This way within a few seconds, the merchant will know that you're trying to double spend.

Normally i would ignore a post like this but its late at night and I can't sleep, you get a reply.


Only mining nodes have to upgrade for the 2MB hardfork capacity increase to take effect. Wallets do not need to upgrade, they can send the exact same data to the network as they did when 1MB was the limit and there will be empty mempools after each block.


No. Users of segwit can make transactions with huge witnesses and they'll pay lightly less that they would if they didn't use segwit, but so few users n the network these days make transactions that need huge witnesses so that point is moot.


I don't see why. The reduction in fees segwit brings is very minimal. The risk of miners rolling back the network and stealing all segwit funds on the network is very real. There is just as much incentive *not* to use segwit as there is to use it. Is the 10 cent reduction in fee worth potentially losing everything?


It doesn't work that way. Capacity is a shared attribute. Everybody has more capacity or no one has more capacity. There is no "people that want capacity can upgrade and have it for themselves". If you are speaking of extension blocks you'd be right, but its not true for segwit.


What? Just because 80% of hashpower is signaling for segwit doesn't mean 80% of the wallets will. We have no idea how many wallets will support segwit. I predict it will be much lower than the core supporters here expect. Nobody knows for sure. To assume it will result in 110% capacity upgrade is absurd.


It doesn't work that way. Capacity is not something an individual experiences different than other people. Its saying "this amusement park has a maximum capacity of 1000 people for everyone except me where the max capacity is 1500 people". It makes no sense.
What you probably mean to say is that if you use segwit when most of the network does not, you still get a slight fee reduction, which is kind of true, but only for transaction with huge witnesses. Your typical single/double input transaction will only have significant fee reduction is the majority of the network uses segwit also, and even then users not using segwit get the same benefit.

That would be a step backwards. Bitcoin is more secure when it's overall hashrate is high. If the overall hashrate lowers, that makes bitcoin less secure. It has nothing to do with "mining centralization". Being mined on GPUs is not going to make bitcoin better, it will make it worse because it will be easier to 51% attack with the lowered hashrate.


Nobody can seize all mining hardware at the same time, which is what is required to take bitcoin down by siezing hardware. You may be right if there one and only one mining farm, but in fact that are dozens spread out throughout the world (not just in china).


Bitcoin only has value if it *works*. The way to keep it working is for it to have the highest hashpower it can possibly have.


That would be disastrous. All those peple who have invested money into keeping the hashrate up will be kicked out. The hashrate will drop like a rock, and it will never grow back to where it was. This will make it easy for a bad person to run a 51% attack.

Yes, but as time goes on, the cost for these resources will go down. Right now it may cost $X to process a bitcoin transaction, but within a few years, it will be $X/2, then a few years later $X/4, etc. Maybe in this particular point in time microtransactions may be too expensive, but thats only because the devs are keeping the 1MB limit in place.

The difference between a microtip and a micropayment is the microtip is optional, and the micropayment is required. Micropayment makes much more sense when dealing with digital goods.

Even if a hard fork *does* invalidate some timelocks coins, couldn't the hard fork also include code that directly pays back any holders who lose coins in said hard fork? Maybe set up a registry where anyone who uses the timelock feature can come forward and announce to the list (anonymously if they wish) their usage of timelock. When devs make a hard fork, part of the code review process is to notify the timelock list of the potential breaking of timelock transactions. If any user is effected by the hard fork, they can come forward of proof that they will lose money in the hard fork, and then the devs can issue coins to them directly from the node client.

Nothing prevents them from doing so, but neither does anything exist to incentivise them to switch back. Segwit by itself is not going to have any significant impact of scaling.

There seems to be two different "decentralization" definitions. One is "technical decentralization", and the other is "political decentralization". Each kind brings it's own benefits to a system. Political decentralization brings about what crypto people call "immutability", and technical decentralization brings about 100% uptime.
Google is technically decentralized, but not politically decentralized. All open source software is politically decentralize, but not necessarily technically decentralized. I've always felt that satoshi designed bitcoin to be technically decentralized, but not necessarily politically decentralized.

Is it really?

There are probably more examples. The only thing keeping Bitcoin from hardforking at this point is a group of very loud "small blockers" who have kept miners away from Classic et al. When those people lose interest in BTC, I'm pretty sure a hard fork to raise the blocksize will happen. The 21 Million cap will never be raised.

No for two reasons:

Are you implying there *isn't* a 100% certainty that a TX with sufficient fee won't get included in a block, when blocks are big enough to clear out the mempool every block? Tell me which factors could cause a fully propagated TX to not make it into the next block when blocks are not full...

There's more to it than that. Every software developer knows you can't grow your userbase an order of magnitude without changing a single line of code. As your users grow, you need to make changes to the code to accommodate that growth. No programmer is good enough to write the code such a way that he gets it right from the beginning and nothing has to be changed ever. It is wrong to treat code like it is absolute law. Take a look at the DAO fiasco to see what happens when you treat code as absolute law.

What makes you so sure? In my opinion, even a 5 node network is still censorship resistant. What if some of those 5 nodes were behind tor? How is any government going to censor those nodes if they are hidden services?


Yes, the word "centralized" is way overloaded. In my opinion, "decentralization" is defined by more than just node count. For instance a car has 4 wheels and a motorcycle has 2 wheels. But the differences between the two are more than just number of wheels. If you remove two wheels from a car does that make your car turn into a motorcycle? Of course not, as the definition of a motorcycle covers more than just number of wheels. A decentralized network is decentralized because it was designed that way. Node count decreasing doesn't change the design.
I think a very important aspect of decentralization that is often overlooked is "open source-ness". As long as bitcoin is open source, new nodes can come online, offsetting nodes that go offline. Paypal is not open source, so if the main Paypal "node" goes offline, there can't be any others to take it's place.

This sounds like a "no true scotsman" fallacy. Your statement is only true if you want to use a completely custom definition of the word "decentralized".

What do you mean by this? Of course miners have a reason to have a full copy of the chain. When a miner publishes a new block, the miner needs to make sure the transaction inside that block are valid. You need the entire blockchain to determine if a transaction is valid. Even if that miner were to only publish empty blocks, they still need to know the previous block hash in order to make any proceeding block. Its pretty much impossible to mine without access to full, up-to-date copy of the blockchain.

Are you implying cloud hosting services don't exist? I'm not sure where you're going with this. A coin running on datacenters can still be decentralized.


You seem to be under the impression that BIP131 forces everybody to re-use addresses. This is not true at all. Its an optional system that some people can choose to use who want to receive massive amount of payments to a public address. You can still generate a new address for each change output to maximize your privacy. Not everybody cares about maximum privacy.

No, miners have to mine valid transactions. Preferably ones with a fee attached.


They don't *have* to, but they always do. If they want their mining efforts to result in a useful currency, then they *do* have to follow the mempool. If every miner didn't follow their mempool and only mined bunk transactions, then bitcoin would be completely worthless as a currency and their mining reward would also be worthless.

Yes it does. It has everything to do with scaling. If blocks were not full, and the mempool were cleared out every block, there is absolutely no need for their signing scheme.

Bitcoin is still p2p. It depends on how you define p2p. In my opinion, "p2p" is not derived from *how* the system functions, but rather p2p  occurs as a result of how the system functions.
If you're using a "layer 1" bitcoin wallet, and I'm using one as well, then we can transact together. It doesn't matter if you're using a core wallet, and I'm using a breadwallet. It doesn't matter which continent the wallet server is located on. A property of layer 1 bitcoin is that everyone can send to everyone else. The fact that the actual transactions themselves are not going from literally person to person is irrelevant.
Lightning Network using this same definition is not completely p2p. It is possible that the lightning node my wallet connects to, and the lightning node that your wallet connect to may not have connections amungst themselves, therefore we can't transact.

Yes they do. Firstly, everyone has access to that kind of computer resources via cloud server hosting companies such as Digital Ocean, Rackspace and Amazon Web Services, plus many local companies that provide similar services. Secondly, not everybody even needs to run a full node, only those who need to validate a high volume of payments. Everybody else can and should run a lightweight wallet. And thirdly, even *if* someone had to run a full node, it won't be for another few years, probably decades before it will use "TB's and gbits" of computer resources.


There is no logical basis for this statement. If your wallet generates new addresses each time, then your privacy is safe. If *my* wallet uses the same address over and over again, it has no effect on your privacy whatsoever.

Charlie Lee makes the mistake in that article by thinking the blocksize limit being raised means that miners are *forced* to make blocks that size. For instance the Classic hard fork to 2MB raises the *limit*, but the miner still has the option to make a block smaller if they want. If the "castle walls" are too big then miners can simply start making smaller walls. Also, blocks do not need to get sent to anyone else other than the miners and full nodes, which make up a tiny proportion of the network, since the majority of users use lightweight wallets. Hence, the cost associated with operating the network is highly overstated.

The more tricks you engage in to get away with mining ithout running a full node serves as an orphan risk. If you're were serious about mining, it would behoove you to run a full node. If you can afford the electricity to run the miner, you can afford the bandwidth to run the full node.

Thats not how bitcoin works. I think ETH may work that way with it's "account" model, but bitcoin is definitely not that way. Look up "UTXO" in the bitcoin wiki. There is no auto consolidation in the bitcoin protocol. The purpose of the Wildcard Inputs proposal was to add this ability to bitcoin.

Lets say you write a blog post that goes viral. At the bottom of that blog post you list your bitcoin address where people can send you tips. You receive 10,000 tips of $0.05 worth of bitcoin each. 10,000 nickels adds up to $2K, but unfortunately the way the protocol works today you have to list each one of those inputs separately which results in a gigantic transaction that will cost more than 2K in fees. Wildcard inputs allow you to spend all of those inputs by only adding one of those inputs and then flipping the "wildcard bit". You get to spend 10,000 inputs, but only pay the fee for one input. The problem is that as long as blockstream is in charge of what goes into the bitcoin protocol, wildcard inputs will never be implemented because every blockstream developer who has publically spoken on the proposal has said overtly negative things about it. The BU developers on the other hand (unless they have changed their minds) are in favor of the proposal.

I think on-chain bitcoin is a great microtransaction currency. The only problem is that the way bitcoin is set up today, you have to pay a fee per transaction byte. This means that bitcoin spent from many inputs is very expensive. If one million different people send you a penny's worth of BTC onchain, it will cost a lot of money in fees to spend that bitcoin again, so much so that is becomes infeasible to use. There are ways to solve this, but as long as the current group of people that control bitcoin's development are still in charge of the protocol, none of those changes will ever be merged.

That article is a non-sequitor. How does it apply to what we're talking about here? That article is so full of misinformation, it's embarrassing to read.


Which is extremely easy to detect.


When I say "fee" I mean sufficient fee. The miners have complete control to choose the minimum fee for a TX to be included in a block. If blocks are not completely full, and you propagate a TX with zero fee, there is a possibility that miners will leave it behind. If you include a 5000 satoshi fee, it will *certainly enough* not get left behind.


Bitcoin will never be centralized. If it still functions, it is decentralized. If it somehow becomes *actually* centralized it will be shut down just like how Liberty Reserve was shut down.


I want a bitcoin that works, and that everyone can use.

This is different than "segwit *is* a blocksize increase" that has been coming out of the core camp ever since segwit was announced. Why the change in narrative?

Script reuse (in a receiving context) has nothing to do with fungibility. Lots of people are using public donation addresses, do those people have decreased fungibility? If so, how?
If you're sending from the same address, then thats a different issue. Wildcard inputs do not in any way promote sending from the same script more than once.

I guess you could, but it would either cost a lot of money, or result in the majority of your money being unspendable for a very long time. Especially if you have a lot of UTXOs to coalesce.

Then why don't any of the 700+ altcoins in existence have full blocks?
@_date: 2016-05-14 02:21:00
Well, microtransactions do work on the network today. You just have to wait a few hours instead of a few minutes to get a confirmation. But they will confirm and be part of the blockchain after enough time has passed. Its only "isn't ready yet" if your project *has* to get a confirmation. The only kind of application that needs a confirmation is one that is misusing microtransactions. In my opinion, the only legitimate application of microtransactions is one in which they are used in a "tip jar" sense as opposed to a "cash register" sense.

The cheapest way to combine inputs to save on fee's is for BIP131 (Wildcard inputs) to be implemented in the protocol. Unfortunately, the core developers are vehemently against the proposal.

No, they want low fees.

Then use another blockchain, there are over 700 of them in existence, I'm sure one of them can fit your gamestates.

@_date: 2016-07-27 19:46:52


And your point?


That doesn't matter. If the mempool clears out every block, you can be sure than *any* transaction *with a fee* that has been propagated to the network will make it into the next block. There is absolutely no need to fancy RBF/greenaddress when blocks are not full.
The *only* benefit these things bring is when blocks are full and the optimal fee varies so wildly that you *can't* be sure that any transaction will make it into any block before it's evacuated from the mempool.

thats why you print out a whole stack of them, and spread them throughout your house. That way if one of them gets thrown out, you still have many copies. :)

Use the Autotip browser extension instead. Its available now on the chrome web store. It along with Adblock achieves the same effect as the Brave browser. Unfortunately too few sites support the protocol.

Open the terminal and type in the following commands:
* wget 
* sudo easy_install pyquery
* python mint_bitcoin_sync.py mintlogin mintpassword bitcoinaddress
and make sure you already added the Bitcoin account to your mint account. Then run this script every so often to keep the value updated in your mint account.

It is not at all impossible to detect. For a supposed "bitcoin expert" you seem to not know much about the bitcoin protocol.


Again, not true. If 100% of mining nodes have your TX in their mempool, then there is effectively a 100% chance that that TX will get included in the next block. I'm still waiting for you to prove this assertion wrong.

Have you ever noticed that all negative bitcoin articles always read the same. They use the same old arguments over and over again:
* claiming that BFL is a scam, therefore bitcoin is a scam
* OMG VOLITILITY
* this one site is ran by an ex-con, therefore bitcoin is a scam
* magic the gathering online exchange
* on and on and on...
whereas most positive bitcoin articles contain something new and unique and interesting. This is why I don't worry about these kinds of articles. People truly interested in bitcoin will eventually find the light.

Thats one solution, but how do I generate the keys on osx?
is there a wallet application that does this? (I use blockchain.info)

The "fine print" up until a year or so ago, was that the blocksize limit will eventually be raised. Satoshi himself even talked about raising the limit eventually.

Nobody cares about those people. People who matter, will spent their energy trying to fix the problem instead of blaming others. Bitcoin being open source allows this to occur.

This is hardly a "vulnerability". Full disclosure, I am a developer of a wallet that competes with Jaxx, so I have no incentive to defend jaxx. The only way you can use this "vulnerability" to steal a user's private key is to first gain access to the user's filesystem, which can only be done by the user explicitly granting the privilege. Once an application has access t a user filesystem, it can steal private keys from any program, including bitcoin core's wallet.dat.

I'm going to get downvotes for this, but i don't lik this change at all. The units should always accompany the number. For small values, use mBTC, for lrge values, use BTC. For instance, when showing  trade for 0.00002 BTC, it would bebetter to display this as 0.2 mBTC, yet 200 BTC should never be shown as 200,000 mBTC, thats just confising.
