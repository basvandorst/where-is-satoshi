nuts, I've used the Hasty Market BTM, shame this kind of shit is causing the owner to consider removing it and frankly I don't have any sympathy for the people scammed because all the BTMs I've seen so far, *including that one* have obvious warnings about falling prey to such scams.

Thanks! Love Electrum but sometimes it's hard to figure out the documentation for the small details

No offense but I tuned out half-way myself and I love Bitcoin. I prefer for the ideological implications to remain as subtext and so do most people. I don't know why you would take someone venting as an invitation to preach from a soapbox, but most of the time when people are venting they just want to be humoured, not educated.
Hell, even as a Bitcoin enthusiast, I don't want to hear any zealotry. Keep it under your hat, please. I just want to do business, and nobody really wants to do business with someone who they suspect might leave their stable life by the wayside to become a revolutionary (we all know how well that turned out for Che). When you talk about revolutions, you just leave the impression with people that Bitcoin is fringe and that pushes them further away from the concept.

Why would you to try and explain Bitcoin via blockchain and mining incentives *before* explaining how to even use it? That's like trying to explain how to use cash by first going over the organizational structure of the central bank.


First of all, there is a third party: the network. The Bitcoin whitepaper even sets up the rationale for the network by comparing it to a bank in functionality.
Secondly, wallets don't transmit keys. Wallets sign transactions, and the network acts as the witness in lieu of a bank or other centralized authority.

Your opinion on this topic is really bizarre given that localcoinatm is known for setting up machines that make it easier for people to convert their "slave money" to Bitcoin than any other methods.

I honestly don't think it's a stretch to suggest that a basket of major PoW cryptocurrencies could serve as the base currency for the entire global economy to be pegged to.
It would be like dollarization, only better.

Should you buy Bitcoin? Yes. Should you bet your entire life savings on Bitcoin? No.
Think like an investor, not like a gambler.

Buy at ATMs when the price dips, you don't need to jump through a single hoop just stuff cash into the box and receive XBT

Bitcoin is a currency, because **it has no intrinsic value**. The network provides Bitcoin with its value, and if there are only holders, that means no transactions, which means no fees, which means no incentive for sustaining the network. Fungibility is *everything* for Bitcoin. What else could it possibly be categorized as but a currency?

Neither can the blockchain, end of discussion.
