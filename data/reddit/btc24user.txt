Currently? Not easy i would guess. The market is too small, the price too low, they would need tons and tons of coins that are not available on the market. Technically they would just need to start buying slowly on any exchange. as the price rises they would end up at some point with coins worth millions, but only because they pumped the price in the buying process.
@_date: 2015-06-16 10:34:50
My opinion: a *hard* limit of 8MB is not a good solution. Like someone has written above, the limit does not cause blocks to be that size right from the start. And if bitcoin naturally grows to that size over time and china can't handle it, then the free market will have to sort it out again and another fork has to be done. Not the best outlook. The best solution I see so far is BIP100. The hard limit of 32MB is ok to me. 4.6GB/day - That is A LOT of data compared to today. Combined with the floating limit to prevent sudden huge block size changes. Not that we need 8MB blocks this or next year, but a hard limit this low is not good as we might have the same discussions again in a year or two. A low hard limit can be a huge problem, should a wave of adoption happen which increases usage in an exponential way for even a short amount of time.

Why do they rely on data from blockchain.info? Why can other exchanges do it without? No fixed date for withdrawals and another 4 workdays of uncertainty. To me the announcement is showing gox's incompetence at best and buying time for much worse announcements at worst.

While electrum *is* the best desktop wallet to me i would not store more than $100 worth of coins on there unless it is a dedicated machine which does not surf the web. If the machine is compromised the walled file can be stolen and the wallet passphrase keylogged. I suggest Mycelium/Breadwallet (Edit: for smaller amounts) and Trezor for higher amounts.
@_date: 2014-12-12 14:15:07
Correct. Only store smaller amounts on mobile wallets. That is why i said trezor for higher amounts. Or paper wallets.

Great article, originally submitted to by the author @_date: 2014-11-13 11:06:14
I never understood why people would think that? I mean they must have heard even remotely that someone somewhere might accept bitcoin as a payment. That is imho how many people hear about bitcoin the first time anyways. Dell, Overstock, etc... And if someone accepts it as a payment there is for sure a smaller unit otherwise it would be impossible to buy a pair of socks.

He said language because he keeps the seed(or brainwallet) in "plain English" in his head while he crosses the border. So essentially money hidden in normal words which cannot be stopped from crossing borders. Great example of the power of bitcoin.

 - The blockchain.info wallet is pretty good for an online wallet since encryption is done locally and private keys are not stored unencrypted on their servers. But it still leaves room for (user)errors like with email backups. I like to keep everything separate. Nothing related to my bitcoin storage ever touches anything of my day-to-day computing.

Alternatives? Because too expensive? What is the fair value of a bitcoin in your opinion?  
Bitcoin has no fixed value. And it is not expensive or cheap at any point. You can move a million dollars with bitcoin when it is valued at $1 or $1 000 000 per coin. It makes no difference. If you want to use bitcoin to buy a loaf of bread it does not matter if it costs $1 000 000 per coin. Bitcoin is not expensive in that case. You can buy the amount of bitcoin which is needed to get the loaf of bread. In the end its just decimals. Of course it feels expensive compared to the value a year ago. Bitcoin value changes with adoption. So if it will not increase another 100x then adoption cannot increase 100x. Where does adoption stop? nobody knows at this point. people have made valuations up if bitcoin would replace this or that. Bitcoin has many functions, such as transacting or to storing value. we just have to wait and see. Currently Bitcoin is way too small for Wall Street to be interested in. There are single asset and fund management compoanies that manage funds worth multiple times the whole current bitcoin market cap. So lets sit back and see where the journey goes.

true. but i dont think miners sell all their coins once mined. A coin that is mined and not sold is the same as if the coin was not mined in the first place. it doesnt get into circulation until sold. the more coins on the market the lesser their value.

I still wouldn't trust this solution with large amounts of BTC. [A dedicated machine with no internet browser and paper wallets for long term storage are better](
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:36:55
Maybe this helps:

The comments on that article are interesting. Grab some popcorn first though.
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:30:38
electrum decides the words. so if they appear anywhere there is nothing you can do.

That sucks :( Don't store more than pocket-change online. And never without 2-Factor-Auth. Keep your coins safe:

Also this: 
@_date: 2013-11-15 11:42:55
No problem. I send coins from my "dirty" wallet to my clean validated one. And i'm good. Oh this invalidates my clean wallet? cool... then i can send coins from my dirty wallet to all the folks i don't like. Either way this whole thing is a mess.

ProTip: Buy the gift with BTC, buy BTC directly thereafter. Result: Stimulated BTC economy, while still keeping same stash of BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:07:42
That is roughly my strategy since march. Apart from that i hardly sold any yet.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:25:01
I'm sorry for your loss. With bitcoin the money is literally on the computer and it is not safe to store it on your main computer that is used to surf all kinds of websites and installs all kinds of software. Like i wrote in another thread:  and this won't happen. Don't store bitcoins on your main machine you use to surf the internet. Either an extra machine or paper wallets.

he will see it if you post it here:   
He posted a statement there yesterday.

To keep it simple and avoid user errors i would create a paper wallet and just send all the coins to the new address of the paper wallet.

This! There is so much FUD around BTC24 right now...

ProTip: Shop with BTC, buy BTC directly thereafter. Result: Stimulated BTC economy &amp; made a great deal, while still keeping same stash of BTC.

Nope. Did you watch the video?
@_date: 2013-12-01 11:51:22
Bring it. The lower it falls the more coins I buy. Did this since the April crash. At the end of every crash i have more coins than before.
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:05:32
consolidation. or bulls and bears waiting for the other one to make a big move. bitcoin needs a rest.

Or the fact that they have to re-buy these coins at some point in life if bitcoin adoption continues spreading like it is. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:24:00
How can one be "too late" on something that is deflationary?  Unless you count on a huge correction to buy in soon™

beat me to it. don't understand = terrorist tool.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:34:39
Brilliant! That's like BitPay, just the other way around. Pay with coins but use fiat. Your amount of coins stays flat.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:56:45
How? If in 5 years bitcoin is a common way to pay for things they have to check every purchase if the bitcoins have been acquired a long time ago? And 90% of all purchases are from normal people that did not have huge gains. Every purchase has to be checked. millions of them. Good luck. Excited to see how this will play out.

The Chinese are getting nervous because of too much volatility.. price went from 3000 to 7000 and back to 3500 CNY .. so UP 500 net. Now they wish for regulation.. wtf:

You could ask Woo directly if there is an alternative or if they have anything planned for the future.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:31:11
$1k is a huge barrier like others said, **but** we are not far from it. So I'd say over 1k in 6 months which is a looong time in BTC land.
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:14:30
Sneaky. This works. Or just hide your password within other data around you, written down in notes or a binder where you keep documents. Many possibilities. Numbers can be hidden within a bunch of phone numbers in an address book for example.

Have you brought this up in the armory forum?  If it is a bug it should be fixed. The devs are usually pretty communicative there.

And still tons of people ask if they missed the train. Or if bitcoin reached its peak/saturation.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:55:52
Try some other exchanges. Depends on where you are located. Coinbase for USA, Bitstamp for Europe. Or this can help 
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:50:43
you have an address on coinbase? buy them on coinbase.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:10:39
You are a very early adopter if you buy today. Go out on the streets and try to find someone who has some BTC, not just having heard about bitcoin. I know many people who heard about it in the media. but none of them owns any.
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:47:45
Sure. I see your point. This came up before and the following was said: Bitcoin has the network effect on its side, and bitcoin can adapt and change. Not overnight but before another cryptocurrency with that "special" feature grows large enough to be of concern. So for now we can only enjoy the ride.
