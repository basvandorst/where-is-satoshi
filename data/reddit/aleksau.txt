Have you used the Ripio service and is there a huge price gap over the dollar blue rate?
@_date: 2014-09-03 08:45:12
Can you please confirm if you can buy at those rates? Go down the shops and test it out! buy $10 worth and report back here. The order book on the exchange says different and its very thin.

Denial — As the reality of loss is hard to face, one of the first reactions to follow the loss is Denial. What this means is that the person is trying to shut out the reality or magnitude of their situation, and begin to develop a false, preferable reality.

Looks legit.

Great now have a look at their order book
You can buy 0.01 BTC at that rate, anything more than that and welcome to buthurt
@_date: 2014-09-03 08:04:12
Sorry but its not going to happen, the spreads people are paying are incredibiley painful.  I just looked at  (the exchange that Ripio uses in Brazil) and their rate is currently R$1160 which is roughly $517USD and as I type the rates on are Bitstamp/Okcoin $475. No doubt the Ripio slug another few $$ on top of that. You really need some competition or encourage these smaller exchanges to create relationships with some of the bigger exchanges and use their order books
@_date: 2014-10-06 02:48:38
$85 to $1200.... pure manipulation
