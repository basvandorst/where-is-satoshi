Just stop selling and start buying - it‘s that easy :-)

Maybe some whale proves humor and buys a huge stake to make your post become meaningful.

To be clear: I won‘t sell, but hodling sure is a challenge.

I like living on the edge.

Just DCA - timing the market is near impossible.

Read a lot about miner capitulation lately, maybe it‘s indeed happening..

Hey, 
thanks for the reply. Yes i opened a ticket 3 days ago. They gave no reason neither did they reply to my ticket. My account is Tier-3-verified and it was my first deposit. I just don't get it and it really sucks that they simply freeze your money without notifying you..

They enable it via [Bison App]( which allows withdrawals of your crypto, so yes :-).

What will they reveal?

Every dollar counts.

The app is awesome, never bought and sold cryptos so easily before. Main advantage (some purists probably see differently), is that it‘s backed by Börse Stuttgart (one of germany‘s stock exchanges).

That is correct. The german tax office treats Bitcoin as a currency. If you hold them &gt;1year, the so called „Spekulationsfrist“ has then expired and potential gains are 100% tax free.
