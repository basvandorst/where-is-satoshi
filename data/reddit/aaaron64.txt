Dude, really? It's a joke, I don't get why you're calling BS on that just because it slightly goes against what you think Bitcoin is worth. 
Crypto in any form is not garanteed to succeed. It very well could, but if you can't entertain the possibility of BTC crashing to $0 then you should not be investing.

Risk VS reward I guess. With some bitcoin wallets, there’s millions and millions in there, so it’d only be one crime you’d have to get away with to set you up for life. Robbing a video store or doing male ware means you’d probably have to do a lot of that crime, and get away with them all, in order to reap the same reward.

Good thing you asked at least! I'd still advise buying your bitcoin on GDAX though as it really cuts down on fees. For the same amount of Bitcoin, Coinbase charged me £4 and GDAX charged me £0.30p! 
[Here]( is a good little how to. (Ignore the currency conversion part if you're American and can put in dollars. The rest still stands though.)

From a criminals perspective, robbing someone’s bank account is hard. You have to get around security, make the money untraceable to you and then launder it. 
Meanwhile, Bitcoin wallets can be brute forced into (the crowbar method,) and are easily transferable.

The best exchange for day trading is GDAX. It is owned by Coinbase, so you can login with your coinbase account and transfer any funds stored in your Coinbase instantly and for free. 
The benifit if using GDAX is that you can set limit orders so you don’t have to manually buy and sell all the time and (from my experience) there are way less fees when buying.
I would suggest that you seriously watch and get a feel for the market before starting. A couple weeks isn’t enough. I would put money in and keep it there for about 3-4 months before trying to day trade.
e; from reading your post through again, you talk as if you haven't had much experience with day trading before. If i'm wrong here then feel free to ignore this, but if you haven't - I would seriously not advise you to begin day trading on Bitcoin. Invest in it long-term and 'hodl', sure, but it is a very hard currency to have your first day trading experience on.

Didn’t Cersei ultimately end up winning against Ned Stark..? :/
Also would’ve been funny to see Hot Pie as dogecoin
