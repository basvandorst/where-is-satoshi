No way. I sold 16k at $395 (then panicked and bought back in at $406) and no cliff or bump occurred. This had to be like 50-100k stuff.

This is the best answer. Been using Coinbase from my start. I'm very happy with the services and never had a scare. The only reason it was removed is because they are in favor of BIP101, a solution to the block size debate. It really was a childish move to remove them. It's right up there with removing Reddit voting.

I too did LMAO. Feels good, and also bad.

I can just see Bob in his lazy boy now realizing Bitcoin is just a gold coin with a sticker on it.
@_date: 2015-12-12 05:00:26
Got it. Sorry. I sold $16k not 16k BTC

You've got to live a little and just take a mini chuckle and move on. It's what I did when I was cruising the map and I thought I would share a chuckle.
@_date: 2015-12-09 15:50:47
Fair point. I've always wondered the accuracy of that map. Vancouver BC looks like a great spot for Bitcoiners.

Better than Stripe, only in EU and US, but transfers to pay people is only in US. But their node.js api and testing environment is way rad.
@_date: 2014-03-29 17:20:06
Bought at 803 and 670 still holding

I watched all four hours of this video and it was actually a very open conversation about Bitcoin not just 'blockchain.' I came out bullish in the end.
@_date: 2016-03-03 16:55:07
Yes, through sharding by the end of the year they estimate 10,000 tps, Bitcoin is around 7 tps and Visa is around 2,000 tps.
@_date: 2016-01-16 23:17:09
Soooooo loooong, but so good. I spent last night and all day today watching this and the after panel (separate video). Sent this video to a friend who has been debating on putting money. He watched it all too and bought his first 3btc.
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:44:57
There is an app that you can buy lotto tickets with Bitcoin called jackpocket. Not sure what states they support but I could not buy one in Oregon.

Been doing this for a while and the more I read the more ethereum makes sense. Just picked up my first 2k ETH.
@_date: 2016-01-11 14:59:04
Cashing  out on Bitcoin? Which major players?
@_date: 2016-01-17 00:05:25
The regulation openness I think was more important than the definition of Bitcoin. It's a fair point to not call Bitcoin a currency, it's probably more. There was the point of how did they define the Internet in the 90's, a phone? A mailbox? A store? A clock?

A couple graphamates would help indudablemente.

I was about to post this, then I remembered I have google.
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:46:51
So far it's just speeding up the clock up for me. I keep putting in dollars and losing value.
@_date: 2015-07-28 04:30:22
Perfectly put.

I've learned more from reading this thread the last 40 min than I have lurking r/Bitcoin since 2013.
@_date: 2015-07-26 19:22:56
I just calculated it needs to go to $450 for me to break even. Not sure if I should just get more now to lower the number or just ride it out. I bought at 800, 650 and 220 totaling 18 coins or just cut my 3k loss. There's a BMW motorcycle I've been eyeing.
@_date: 2015-07-27 14:43:18
I just computed total spent and the price needed to be worth that which came to $450/coin.

There was a link earlier on this but it's the Hyperledger blockchain with the Linux foundation

Think of it with a sign outside that says only two people allowed when the club is large enough to fit much more. They just need to change the sign not the club.

After a little reading I think for a limited time there are no conversion fees. But yes this will be right sooner or later.

In layman's terms: Dave logs in to Coinbase which can hit endpoints a, b, and c to get x, y, and z.
@_date: 2016-05-17 05:10:54
No. Do more homework.
@_date: 2016-05-17 05:06:05
A lot of really quality points you made here. Do go on.

Same 13k in. Break even is $350.

So much for wisdom of the crowd. The weighted average was somewhere around $6,000
