[Looking at your transaction]( you paid 44 sats/byte.
Take a look at the [mempool]( (3rd graph). There are at least 150 MB of unconfirmed transactions that paid more than you. So you have to wait at least 150 blocks  (25 hours) for your transactions but this is only if no new transactions are made. So you look for 3 days+ if you are lucky.

If you feel it is unsafe to have you don't have to keep it.
But if your Ledger gets destroyed or lost your coins are lost forever. So better keep a copy.

Honest question: Why is the invoice for 8$ 0.71082964 mBTC but in the next picture it's 'value: 71082'? Did you actually pay 0.71082 mBTC?

Yes, JoHoe restarted that server.

How can I close a channel if it is emtpy? Who is going to pay the fee to close it?
Do I have to open a new channel every time I want money in the LN or can I send BTC to an open channel?

And everytime you reload it looks different.

The way I understand it now is that the coffee shop doesn't need to close the channel for every customer. If an exchange has an open channel the store can sell the BTC there. But with lees fees than today.

Coinbase it not an exchange, it's a merchant. Coinbase uses [GDAX]( as exchange.

Well, yes, of course. I need to think about a bit longer.
So this maybe another stupid question. If I open a channel with someone who has no other channels. Are we both part of the network or are we separated from the network? If the latter is the case it would be better to open a channel with someone who has a lot of peers, right? But if that channel gets closed you are again lost. Until someone open a channel with you, I guess.

What's the difference between green and blue channels?
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:06:08
I was just told the one closing the channel pays the fee. But I guess there is no need to close a channel really.

Wow, now I feel stupid. Thanks, was confused by the units!
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:47:02
But where are the 964 satoshis?

Can you do the same analysis for Block [
Or could you tell me how you have done it? I'm really interested.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:01:08
So if I have spent everything on a channel there is no need to close it, right?
And if exchanges start to use LN I can exchange BTC on my channel to USD?
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:15:23
But with 467 sat/B it should be in the next block.

Coinbase is close to being insolvent? How so?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:23:15
200k transactions with 110 BTC pending fee.

[This site]( says the difficulty is going to rise.

On bitcointalk they counted around 135,000 lost bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:29:45
What will happen? 
@_date: 2018-02-23 07:58:31
Binance is doing a lot of consolidation. Look at their wallet: [1NDyJtNTjmwk5xPNhjgAMu4HDHigtobu1s](
They are always paying 100 sat/B.
