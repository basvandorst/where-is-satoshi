I don't understand this.
Was it fraud?
Why didn't they process the transaction? If it was because the market was dropping or if their was a problem - well, isn't that on the onus of OP?
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:52:17
Nah man... it sounds like you had to pay taxes and your burnt by it.
I'm sure it will also go to Hospitals and schools and roads and all the rest.
I'm in Australia. i don't like giving money to my government either - but they provide man!
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:04:30
But we talk so much about other economies.... But bitcoin has tripled in 6 weeks I've been watching it.
Doesn't that show how unstable this is.
But because it's going up... People are getting rich and loving it.
But if this was weighted out for the rest of the world... It means someone would be paying/suffering for it.
Just sayin... 
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:09:12
Yeah it it is... But my money was insured, safe... Had ATM cards, numbers to call if things fucked up etc....
And in time... I expect it to become cheaper and cheaper. 
I don't get that from bitcoin? Or do I 
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:27:38
I mentioned "BitInnovate" here a few posts ago - hoping that they would scour this subreddit, see their name and then reply.
Man... I'd watch these guys.
I sent them multiple emails with NO reply.
Their site is constantly going down and they charge a commssion to buy and sell (so 7% in, 7% out).
I don't know man... the way BitCoin is going, I wouldnt hold my breath depositing it with these guys and good luck trying to explain thsi one to the police (No way anyone will understand BitCoin)

@_date: 2013-11-13 01:30:54
Translation: I'm looking to try and double my money
(No problem with that - but come on, let's be real. You're just wanting to make some money)
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:19:42
Not sure if real... or sarcastic
@_date: 2013-03-30 11:45:19
Yeah... Thanks for your honest reply.
To me... Half the posts here are frenzied "tell everyone about bitcoin" so that the price rises.
The other half are... "this company stole my bitcoin" or "don't trust this guy/wallet etc
So really, I can see some lucky people are going to get rich. But I just think that e banks will be forced to offer better services which will just make this all redundant.
So we still win- with better services from the banks.... But yeah, I'm just kind of seeing this as one giant get rich quick scheme
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:49:10
I like the bitcoin premise, but by gosh... The level of greed I've seen here over the past few days! Kind of sickening
@_date: 2013-04-16 23:46:28
NO BEGGING
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:25:27
The biggest problem I have... is actually getting paid out.
It seems to me, having $250k worth of BTC sounds great... but finding a vendor/commission/bank to actually give you your $250k in USD will be the problem
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:10:57
some dude doublespent or something..not entirely sure the terminology... But doubled his money.
People always are claiming about not trusting exchanges and so on.
Paper wallets are the equivalent of taking your cash out and keeping it in under your mattress
@_date: 2013-03-12 06:03:40
Thanks Man... appreciate it!
Helping me understand things better - I like to translate what you've said... so in short, my interpretation is:
It isn't complicated and just give it a shot. Our faith in Credit Cards and Teller Machines is way more complicated - and we accept that, so try Bitcoin.
Volatility is real and people will ALWAYS be opportunistic. No point crying over a Wall ST trader who will make 100k tomorrow because he bought low and sold high.... Volatility is the nature of currency and if we are to be optimistic, even at $50usd... it could be a good buy
Would you agree with this?
The thing is man... I signed up with ING bank (big Bank) and they say to me... "Here, sign this 100 page disclosure form... that if you actually took the time to read, it says we can massively screw you over in some shape or form... but if it Doesn't happen... and we're confident it won't... here is 5% interest per annum if you give us your money".
So to me - while its calculated, I thought i might just move some money over to Bitcoins and see if i can get better interest there?
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:24:27
TLDR: Give me money
@_date: 2013-04-07 07:56:09
This is an utter load of bullshit.
Sorry man - thanks for sharing. But its Bullshit!
Because dude... you're smart, probably smarter than most!
It's your downfall... because the 99% around you aren't ...and it separates you from them!
 And you know what, these people need people like you to sort their shit out for them. 
They need leaders and banks and politicians (as much as I don't like it) to order them and instruct them.
Because they don't find happiness in breaking down the walls like what you do... that simply isn't for everyone.
So Sure... BitCoin might shake things up. But fundamentally... its absolutely no difference to the currency and monetary system we have in place now.
The difference is... a whole bunch of people not happy being as "rich" as others came along and said... hey, let's make ourselves "rich".
And you're one of them.
I'm not pointing the finger at you man. You're done. 
Game. Set. Match.
If what you say is true... well, you're now part (or could be soon) part of an elite few that will have the financial power to really change people's lives.
So well done man... You got in early and got rich.
Just like what the other 99% of people on r/bitcoin are doing. Getting Rich.
I'm not clever enough to have done that. My bad.
But you know what pisses me off about BitCoin... is that no one, individually in that Subreddit or those pursuing it really seem to be doing anything else - but wanting to get rich of it.
The champagne gets popped every time the Bitcoin rises compared to the USD.
Its literally like watching the pigs in Animal Farm at the trophs filled with cash!
But these are the anonymous few. The trolls and the faceless accounts of Reddit getting rich...
These are the very men and women that, god forbid, could be the very people who hold bulk wealth.... with no union, no tax, no restraint, no rules....
Like my username... how ironic it serves its person... but its "energy4anarchy"
Edit: If you're so rich, you can depoist 200 bit coins here: 
@_date: 2013-03-12 05:39:20
Yeah - I've gone through a lot of the comments and I can see it went into a bit of a panic mode.
The thing is - for the average person (me) or even the common person - it just sounds really difficult to become a part of.
I know its a complex currency worth hundreds of millions of dollars and so it should be.... But i think what's stopping it going mainstream is that people will think "Oh, you have to be a computer wiz kid to know what you're doing".
One other aspect i don't like - i know this can happen to ANY stock or ANY currency - but it seems like its extremely opportunistic when it does crash.
The USD has its highss and lows for example - drops here and there - but doesn't crash as quickly as what Bit Coin does.
Or in other terms - the minute that this "Fork" problem happened, opportunistic people jumped on it, bought cheap and are now riding it out.
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:51:44
There are people who do this.
And they're going to suffer for it.... and we shouldn't be smug and go "Fucking serves you right".
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:48:17
I disagree. Most people, from their comments and reasoning to invest in bitcoin is for their own back pocket (wealth)
To me, I can't see the "greater good" in bitcoin. It still is just about making people rich... And this subreddit is kind f just a bandwagon of people trying to push it
@_date: 2013-04-16 11:03:13
Yeah man - great country!!!
@_date: 2013-03-13 00:38:18
And what did that mean to the guy who deposited $10k
@_date: 2013-03-12 07:08:15
I'd love to read this! Keep me posted
@_date: 2013-04-16 09:56:32
Nope, i went to school to pick up da slutz
@_date: 2013-03-30 11:51:09
I know. People always bring the wosrt out huh!!!
But yeah, I just don't really see the value... Except saving some fees/interest compared to the bigger banks... But why use bitcoin apart from anonymity. I don't need to keep my purchases private
@_date: 2013-03-19 11:49:39
And what about purchasing them. I'm in Australia and most places want between a 5% and 10% commission for doing so?
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:04:43
@_date: 2013-03-12 23:31:23
Explain like I'm 5 someone?
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:49:11
Hey man... you seem to reply to a few of my posts... so thanks!
You know what my opinion of it is.... is that BitCoin, at least in the last say 1 month... has brought the greed out of people.
Good luck to those getting rich. But man, something just didnt feel right about it.
I'm sure many will keep getting rich. But yeah - all the people that bought in when it was $4 per coin or even the ones who mined thousands for free... they're the ones that are like "Oh well, I'll still keep them and see what happens".
because to them - it doesn't mean shit. They didn't as much put their hard earned $$ into it.
But i read a thread before where some dude is scared to confront his wife of fear for losing shit loads.
And to me - that's just what is all about this BitCoin stuff. It just doesnt sit right
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:26:19
People will argue the same things about stocks. The old "I wish I had of bought it when it was x price".
This is happening to bitcoin.
I guess my argument I was saying is.... Lots of people bitching about corruption, rich vs poor, the 1%, banks being unfair and so on.
But bitcoin doesn't stop any of this, nor is it really different in principle to the current market. 
People are greedy and getting rich of bitcoin, as they are the USD and the Euro.
@_date: 2013-03-30 13:04:10
Freedom and justice.... Oh and selfishness.
Come on man. Money... Bitcoin or traditional currencies have nothing to do with freedoms or justice.
@_date: 2013-03-30 11:46:22
Then why invest??? Why hold any bitcoins if your not trying to profit?
@_date: 2013-03-19 10:10:27
Cool... thanks man!
And when you say keep your wallet safe... listing it as I've done is fine right?
That's open to everyone
Just keep the password safe so no one can access it and not necessarily stored on my computer?
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:16:20
Thanks man...
Hey... I'm in Australia and we struggle to buy BitCoin here.
We have to literally go to a commissioning agent who takes about 7% cut just to give them to you and yeah - its not worth it.
Another guy (Front Page) writes about being a 30 something and why, in his mind why BitCoin isn't worth it.
But let me just say.... seems to be filled with lots of people flogging it because they either got in really cheap ($2) or mined them for free.
They literally could have made hundreds of thousands and potentially some did.
But to me - this Bubble represents the greed like any currency exchange... be it Mt Gox or Wall St.
But further - I'm just not entirely convinced it isn't being massively manipulated by those in the know how... who'll again strike it rich once we have another peak.
@_date: 2013-03-13 06:08:04
See to me - this is one of the absolute fundamental and core reasons that will stop BitCoin going main stream and having a real impact???
Well, for the average punter who stumbles across this - they'll read it as some guy wired himself 10k, someone mucked up and gave him a further 10k on what he wired... so he kept it!
We need to treat BitCoin with respect... but when these things happen, no one respects it.
It reeks of almost gambling or going to "Vegas"... that at one key stroke, or one bet at the roulette table, you're life savings is either doubled or taken away in a heart beat.
Reddit will love this story because its the little man winning 10k. But really, someone will have to PAY for that 10k and this is the merchant who is doing so.
What had of happened if it was reversed. That he wired himself 10k and it dissapeared. With no trace, no evidence and no one to assist him.
This is absolutely a short term gain with no long term fundamental investment in why BitCoin should be respected.
Sure - we hate the banks. But they offer as some sort of safety. That these things won't happen - and if they do, someone will be responsible and that most likely, you'll get your money back!
I'm guessing reddit will disagree with this entirely.... but in my mind, for what its worth - this actually does Bitcoin much, much more harm than good... and all for the sake of some guy winning 10k
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:25:06
Sounds like my wife.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:27:02
Haha... nice call! I'll give you that!
@_date: 2013-03-30 13:05:05
And what happens when bitcoin does this to you?
You don't think it will happen.
@_date: 2013-03-13 03:27:00
But he doesn't keep it right??? I mean it's a mistak?
@_date: 2013-03-30 13:02:33
I just come to r/bitcoin and yeah, the posts are just "tell everyone about bitcoin" and they sound frenzied and manic.
But I just see through most if it as no doubt, a lot of these people have invested and are just spruiking it for their personal interest
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:43:28
I wouldn't going as far as saying Outrage man... they're your words not mine.
I know every countries currecny right now buys porn and drugs... I'm just saying, it seems like almost the only two things you can buy with bitcoin these days.
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:02:19
I can't send money via paypal in seconds????
Im Australian.
I travelled India last January and my bank charged me I think 7% to pull unlimited cash out in India.
Sure, I didn't like the 7% but it was so easy.
Most bitcoin commission is the same. Bitinnovate for example are close to 8%
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:15:54
Oh - that site looks like its been put together on a WP theme... I 100% take it as authorative compared to all other sites.
edit: sarcasm
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:52:32
Yep, win them over with porn and drugs
@_date: 2013-03-14 06:31:04
So you have about 500k of Bitcoins? all made in November 2012 sometime?
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:27:35
This is what will kill BitCoin.
Because douchebags like this are holding your money and the very merchants, the very guys meant to be the ones promoting it - are destroying it by dishonesty.
Don't be fooled. Just because they have a fancy website or some nice looking tag... they're just a dodgy operation by a couple of young punks.
(Not speaking specifically about BitStamp - just making a very general, over the top, hyperbole comment)
@_date: 2013-03-30 11:47:27
Either way, buy or sell, we always look at the guys on Wall St and accuse them of greed... But I just kind of see it happening here. People cheating, stealing... It's already going on
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:49:16
My payments in PayPal get paid instantly and give me insurance. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 11:53:33
What about people where the currency is stable.
What about the fact that because no one controls it... We have no real knowledge of just how corrupt it can go?
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:04:31
Perhaps... i jus think BitCoin will be labelled that black market currency to buy drugs and porn
@_date: 2013-03-12 05:40:41
Thanks for that.
I'm thnking of just havign some of cash - rather sit in a bank, sit with Bitcoins?
I know their more predominantly used to trade/buy stuff online - but I'm more interested in investing
Your thoguhts?
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:18:17
Yep. I'm this guy too!
Except - I've been around since BBS's and saw the internet grow up... but I'm not even technological minded to muck around with Linux, nor do i build PC's.
I'm just your average Joe Schmuck who has been surfing the net for years... and everything this guy (OP) has written is exactly why BitCoin is not that attractive to me
@_date: 2013-03-30 13:05:49
What's the TLDR
@_date: 2013-04-16 12:28:22
How have you gone with your BTC investments?
@_date: 2013-03-13 06:11:06
So hold on - i just gave off a big rant not fully understanding this - but did this guy just turn his 10k, into 20k... just because of this error?
If so - is he keeping it?
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:20:41
I liked what you had to say initially!
But don't just be smug... what do you forecast for the future of BitCoin.
Let's see how spot on you really get and if right, then we'll hold you up on our shoulders!
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:19:38
But that's what I'm saying. What is the difference. If the banks start lowering their rates to do this stuff... Give insurance, man phone lines for assistance, provide ATMs, net banking etc and all the infrastructure we need.... Wy bitcoin???
Why don't the banks just create an "anonymous" way to transact and bitcoin is history????
Plus.. As I said, bitinnovate in Australia for example charge 7% to buy bitcoin and then again to sell them...  For me in Australia, it's actually more expensive to use them
@_date: 2013-03-30 11:58:41
I don't know. I'm not clever or IT minded enough to know. But in the 6 weeks I've been watching it... I've seen it triple in price, have forks and double spends...l and yeah, I don't trust it
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:22:44
Yep! Same here in Australia.
Sure, there are a few vendors who charge in excess of 5% commissions to both buy... and then sell.
Worst thing about it... I have no confidence knowing if i dropped a substantial amount, say $10K... that I'd actually find one of these companies that would pay me out.
It seems like you buy bitcoins and then you might be stuck with them
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:16:49
My prediction... And I'll honestly say I don't know shit!!!
Seeing the level of greed bitcoin has spurred from people... Those who profited or have nothing really to lose will be back straight on board and buying them cheap... Even at $70
They'll then go back to the usual "bitcoin is awesome" post and drag everyone back up to hundreds, sell and repeat!!!
It's a sham. Unregulated, but hey, someone's getting rich from it
@_date: 2013-03-19 11:59:19
Ok! Are you in Australia (or Japan)
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:50:21
But what's to be excited about?
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:45:42
are you in Australia?
@_date: 2013-03-13 10:24:16
Sorry, It was my birthday yesterday and my wife and I have just gone for a boozy dinner... so this might sound askew
But not to the same ultimate degree... but that's like saying "One murder happened in Australia last year, but its ok because 10,000 happen in America each year".
Its kind of - two wrongs don't make a right!
What I'm really trying to articulate is - that being a "layman", but at least someone who surfs reddit, knows a little IT, has been on the net for 10 years... BitCoins sound great - but they WILL scare away the majority.
And for this to work, they need the "every man" to buy/invest into them.
When little stunts like this are caused... sure, its no biggie... but it really will detract it from being taken seriously.
The same as how we've appluaded this man for making 10k by sheer fluke... we'd not blink an eye if he had lost it all... nor would we care if someone made a fortune, then had it stolen by hackers.
Again, I'm a little tipsy, sorry about that. but I'm a businessman too - and I know people and markets - and things like this, as harmless as they sound, will throw people and their perceptions
@_date: 2013-03-30 11:57:03
Yeah. I'm the same more or less as you.
But while everyone is getting frenzied about this... To me, it doesn't address the real disparities of the rich and the poor.
It's not, in essence anything really that current money/currency isn't.. except with no laws our countries owning it. It's a global currency.... But still, one that will make people very rich and keep some people poor.
If this truly revolutionized the rich and the poor... Great. But I just think its no real different to what we've got now
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:58:52
TLDR: Pay me money
