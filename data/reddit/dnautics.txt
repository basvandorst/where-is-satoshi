I'll address some of these:
Research viability - it's a natural extension of something that is going well so far (except that the main boss up and quit research).  There are challenges, like being able to restart the work in a new environment.
Commercial viability of an open source drug - I think this is a huge concern, and there is no good data on this, so part of the point of the process is to find out.
Competitive concerns about derivative patenting - I'm fine with that.  If big pharma proves that, say, a patented admixture contaning 9DS is effective, then that provides motivation and R&amp;D for the unpatented 9DS alone to be pursued.
Trustworthiness - We have 501(c)(3) - which means very little, there are shitty 501(c)(3)s out there, so you really only have my word on that.
Competence - Check my publication record.
Bitcoins not recoverable - Our policy is on the page:  "Because of the non-refundability of bitcoin, if our fundraising fails to tilt, we will make a best effort to return the bitcoin, or otherwise donate the funds to a 501(c)(3) nonprofit research hospital."
Reference to Satoshi - A very embarassing typo, it's been fixed.  In first grade when I summered in Japan I had a terrible crush on this girl named Nakamura Miwako.

I wouldn't suggest crowdfunding the entire process.  Just this step.  Two reasons to do so.  One, it shows that there is broad support for developing pharmaceuticals without patents.  Two, it's tough to get the experiment funded otherwise (the NIH can't touch this because there is a conflict of interest).  The next step is to look for institutional nonprofit donors (which is helped if more people contribute), and ultimately to partner with a for-profit (probably generics) manufacturer to go the whole way.
In short, thanks for being a naysayer.

Yes, that page is related to the effort...  I would recommend reading this:   which is the free, open-access version.  This should be linked to from the main page.
Timescales:  6 months for this phase of the project.  If the results turn out well, then I'm going to seek institutional and large-scale donations for completing preclinical experiments.  I am unsure as to how to get funds for that stage, but once it's running, this will probably run in the 1-2 year range.  After that, it would move on to clinical trials which can run in the 5 year range.
I'll be honest though, making the gifts is quite fun!  So I don't mind doing it.

Thank you for your analysis.  I'd like to clear up a few things:  The fundraising is to do ONE in vivo experiment (xenograft), I've priced the experiment to pit 9DS against an anticancer agent positive control.  Obviously, this is going to be done by a CRO, because that is more cost-effective and ethical.  The synthesis is relatively easy (note that the major expense in the pie chart is the xenograft); some effort will be spent on making a better batch process.
Synthesis is not a big obstacle, with single digit nanomolar activities, the amount necessary to do a study should be an order of magnitude lower than the amount necessary to do the NCI-60 screen; although in practice I'm aiming to make about half as much as I did before, simply because it's too hard to weigh out less of the stuff.  I'd also like to repeat the experiment that we had to do a 'correction' about in the original paper (we had a result that we're not 100% sure was a publication typo or an experimental flaw) but it's a tertiary concern, only going to be done *after* 9DS is submitted to xenograft, I'm going to spend my own personal money on supplies, etc, to chase that down, except for stuff like lab equipment (which will have already been purchased for the xenograft).
@_date: 2014-09-26 04:50:45
there are shared biohacker spaces available, that decreases cost greatly.  The minimal equipment budget is outlined, obviously I'd like more, which is why our goal is 75k and we're tilting at 50k.  The timeline is six months.  It took about six months of admittedly lackluster postdoc work to scale up 5x as much material as we need for this experiment.  I'm willing to stake my personal income to see that this works out if my budget figures get messed up, but I don't think I could afford a xenograft study (I currently drive for rideshare companies full time and make about $45k equivalent, with about 20 hours a week of useable free time).

I'm quite frankly surprised it didn't cause it to go up instead of down, bitcoin becoming a black market asset in china, and a grey market asset everywhere else would be the best thing that could happen to the (short-term) price.
@_date: 2014-09-25 21:30:37
Thanks, there's not much really tilt or indysci can do about this, since bitcoin donations are kind of just grafted on using a coinbase button. (i personally coded the js for the bitcoin amount part).  I have been getting many coinbase donations.  Are people having problems using a JS blocker like noscript?

Hi!  I'm the person running this campaign.  AMA.
@_date: 2014-09-25 19:20:44
Wow I have no idea how I missed that! Fixing now.

To the folks saying bitcoin is a bubble.  It very likely at some point will exhibit bubble-like activity, but at the moment, it's not.  Bubbles have extremely well characterized price trends, which if you look at the logarithmic chart (the only relevant one), it doesn't fit.
note that the decline is usually ~2x as fast as the rise.
(in short, I totally agree with your analysis, and have been saying this for a while... Nothing I say should be construed as financial advice)
@_date: 2014-04-16 04:42:05
gotcha, thanks!  I'm just running an engine that tries to predict bitcoin movements (like medium-frequency trader)...  Which definitely could still get screwed, not in quite such a dire fashion.
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:39:24
Personally, I would put the odds on getting the xenograft experiment (what I'm fundraising) working at *higher* than 50/50.  It's true that the entire process has a low likelihood of success, but developing a drug is a steppy process, with compounding rates, and let's say each step has an 80% success rate, after 10 steps it's pretty dismal.

1) Isn't university research open and unpatented by default?  No.  It's usually the other way around.  Basically every university has a Tech Transfer office dedicated to protecting their IP and licensing to for-profits.  Postdocs, Grad students, and Professors all sign away the rights to any intellectual material they produce.  Indysci's bylaws, by contrast, require all product to be un-patented.
2) It's a loose analogy, in the most applicable sense relating to the unpatenting.  However, if you consider DNA to be 'biological source code', you can see how it applies.  For the experiment directly pitched, there will be very little DNA modifications, but in case 1) we don't get a full MTA from the university of maryland, or 2) we do more experiments because we can afford to, the DNA source code from Project Marilyn will be treated as if it's open-source software.
3) The results will be disclosed publically here, and I'll probably submit an ArXiV'd paper in QBio.  Depending on if we have enough money to submit to a peer-reviewed journal I'll try to do that too.
4) This is certainly a possibility.  If they do that, though, then it does make a fairly good argument for a generic to come around and submit the parent 9DS through clinicals as an alternative, no?
@_date: 2014-09-25 21:26:45
Because no IP is produced here there isn't really anything "sold" to a large organization.  The fundraising goes to pay for one experiment (I'm pretty clear about that), plus extra experiments if we clear the tilt goal.  I fully expect a for-profit to have to foot the bill for clinical trials (yes finding a willing partner could be excruciatingly difficult, let's cross that bridge when we get there), and don't really expect anything in return.  In fact, indysci.org can't be directly involved in clinical work because of our IRS filings, so that will definitely have to be handed off to someone else.
You have a certain level assurance that I'm not going to really mess this up too badly because I have to try to maintain 501(c)(3) status, so there are rules, and stuff.

It's even more embarassing since my last name is yone-MOTO.  It's been fixed.

Does bitstamp take its fee on orders that don't clear (and get cancelled)?  I don't see how you would lose money - unless by which you mean positions that were losing out didn't get resolved by your bot.

FAQ, item   
What types of cancer will 9DS be effective against?
9DS looks like it will be most effective against melanoma, renal cancer, and triple negative breast cancer. We'll pick one (or more, depending on how much we raise) of these to do the xenograft study. We believe that small changes to the molecule can alter which cancers 9DS analogs go after, so a stretch goal will be to make these alternative molecules and test to see what other types of cancer we might be able to treat.
@_date: 2016-01-26 08:06:22
wait till you see what I name the other molecules in the family (it turns out the other analogs seem to be working too)
@_date: 2016-06-16 01:30:41
Did you get to this part?


I'm not complaining about "having to comply". The issue is not being transparent about what I need to do to comply, or at least telling me it's impossible to comply (I doubt that is the case).  I'm happy to do what it takes to comply.  I suspect that Coinbase doesn't have a way to migrate my account to one that is in compliance, and they can't be bothered to make it happen.  That is a problem, and other nonprofits should know that this is a potential issue.
@_date: 2016-06-16 01:40:21
Of course, that was the first thing I did.
