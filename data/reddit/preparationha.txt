What is with all of these grown men having teddy bears as their profile pics. Is that not weird to anyone else?

It very clearly states withdrawals are done once a day. They most likely batch all outgoing transactions together.
You're overexcited because you made a ton of money. Keep the faith. If you don't see an update after the withdrawal window tomorrow, contact support and make an update here.

bitcoin miners secure the network and process transactions.
for doing that, they are rewarded with newly minted bitcoins + transaction fees. this is how the supply of bitcoin has grown from 0 to a hair over 18,000,000. 
every 210,000 blocks (approximately 3.5 - 4 years), the reward for miners is cut in half, reducing the inflation* of bitcoin by 50%. each bitcoin block currently rewards bitcoin miners with 12.5 newly minted bitcoins.
in under 200 days, that reward reduces to 6.25 newly minted bitcoins. the effects are typically dramatic as price discovery ensues.

Thanks for the clarification. I'm by no means an expert and relying on my poor memory.

It won't get to 10MB. Segwit has a max limit of approximately 3.6 MB blocks, and that's assuming there was 100% SW adoption.
The next "increase" will come from [Schnorr signatures]( which have the potential to reduce some transactions to 1/7 of their current size. Schnorr, coupled with LN will hopefully be a huge relief valve for the network.
I'm in the boat of supporting optimization before making hard fork block size increases. That being said, I drastically underestimated how quickly technical innovations are being implemented. SegWit has been available for a long time and we are only at ~60% adoption. Bad actors will eventually be purged but it will be slow going.
Bitcoin in its current state is woefully underprepared for another bubble and surge in transactions but in a year's time, I expect that won't be the case.

I've talked about this with a CPA friend of mine, in no official capacity, but it was indicated you would owe taxes on the gains accumulated during your time in the US.
Scenario with Rough Approximations:
* Buy 100 BTC for $1000 each on 1/1/2017
* Move to PR on 04/25/2019 when the price is $5,500
* Sell 100 BTC for $100,000 each on 1/1/2022
Taxable Gains = $10,000,000 - $100,000 = $9,900,000
Owed Taxes = (($5,500 - $1,000) * 100) * (20% (federal) + 5% (varies by state)) = $112,500
In this scenario, you owe taxes on approx. $450,000 from your time in the US. 
You don't owe taxes on the remaining $9,450,000, leaving you with a net savings of approx. $2,362,500.
ALSO, very important, there is a 3 year requirement. If you live in PR for a year and move back to the states, you are on the hook for the taxes you didn't pay.
This is not financial advice. Speak with a professional accountant/lawyer.

Mods, can we ban user:my2sats. 
The dude is spamming LN tips with 0 balance. It's a total waste of time for anyone trying to collect.

Downloaded BlueWallet this past week and have been pleasantly surprised. The UI/UX definitely has room for improvement but things are moving in the right direction at a rapid pace. I'll probably be waiting another 6 months to a year before I'll feel comfortable moving more money to the LN.

Good to know. Thanks for the info!

This has been pretty typical due to the nature of mining. 
I may be wrong but the sub-10 average block time will happen when there is sustained growth in the network hash rate. 
Difficulty adjustments also take roughly two weeks so there tend to be sustained periods of disproportional difficulty to hash rate (leading to faster blocks).
There will be hiccups along the way but I don't think oscillating around the 10 minute mark is a bad thing long term. Bitcoin is meant to naturally adjust based on the current environment.

Fair point, but I don't think it disqualifies the privacy concerns. 
 
If you attempt to convert criminal BTC into any fiat currency, you'll easily get flagged and claiming ignorance won't protect you. The argument could be made to just keep it in the BTC ecosystem but whitelists/blacklists are a thing and the value/utility of a tainted token goes down.

It still happens but it gets more and more risky everyday. If I'm doing anything illegal with Bitcoin, I'd want to know the statute of limitations because that transaction history isn't going anywhere.
Even the intent to obfuscate via mixing could lead to prosecution because the intent is there. I'm not saying that's fair or that's how it'll be, but the possibility definitely exists.

Bitcoin needs more standardized metrics. This is a cherry-picked stat that helps push a narrative to noobs.
Unfortunately, I only have the mental capacity to complain instead of providing an alternative.
@_date: 2018-12-10 14:16:41
This would be a disaster for fees.
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:50:41
I agree and see that as a huge benefit. It gives everyone the ability to fact check and separate truth from fiction.
The problem is, not everyone has the time or understanding necessary to look at the narratives being pushed. To me, this tweet kind of takes advantage of noobs that may not understand that 1 new wallet &lt;&gt; 1 person.
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:02:32
I agree it's difficult to come up with useful metrics but there can certainly be better methodologies than the one advocated in the tweet. 
My wallet probably has 30 of these "unique wallet addresses" created within the past year and has a total value of around $100 at the moment.
If Bitcoin was designed with privacy in mind, it is an utter embarrassment and a complete failure. Fortunately, we have core devs and other cryptos working on it. I have no doubt that Bitcoin in the future will have far more privacy features than it currently does.

This is the capitulation I've been waiting for.
@_date: 2019-05-07 01:36:42
Makes sense. If Bitcoin is successful, it will be an existential threat to the status quo. It can't be controlled so it must be regulated out of existence. I'm frankly surprised it hasn't happened yet.

Ignore vocal complainers. These are great videos and it's great to see them on this sub instead of price memes. Subscribed to your channel and looking forward to more content.
