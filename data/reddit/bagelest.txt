Let us not forget that it is a Friday. I always regret crypto purchases made on Fridays. Sundays, however...

Thank you for saving me from my ignorance ����

If the amount you’re getting is within the weekly limit, the fastest method IME is Coinbase debit card purchase with a big honkin’ fee. Be prepared for more fees from your bank, because many banks register Coinbase as a foreign ATM. The BTC shows up immediately. Transfer your BTC to GDAX (same account credentials as Coinbase, lower transfer fees) if you intend to do anything but keep it in your Coinbase wallet.
If you’re looking to get an amount higher than the weekly limit, you can make a purchase in Coinbase from a linked bank account; the price is locked in when you hit BUY, but the actual purchase can take several days, so the BTC won’t show up immediately (but will register as a pending transfer). This is helpful if you’re just trying to “buy the dip” or “catch the falling knife,” but don’t expect to be able to cancel the sale if the price continues dropping while your purchase is pending.

Hey I get this reference!

It's *always* a guess. Even if a prediction is backed up by strong evidence and eventually comes exactly to fruition, it is and always was dependent on things playing out exactly as they did. That space in time between the prediction and the playout is under no one's control. A butterfly flaps its wings somewhere and the universe goes haywire - the chain reaction forms a hurricane strong enough to suck the biggest whales right up out of the ocean and beach them on landfall. *You just never know*.
I acknowledge that there are people who work their asses off at crypto and border on omniscience about the market. I have mad respect for those folks. But I could never trust anyone who lacks the fundamental awareness that it could all just go to shit. Fear has always kept us alive.

Agree with this. I’ve got some fiat ready but am keeping my trigger finger on hold through at least the wee hours tonight/tomorrow morning.

Humor me, I'm new. Why?
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:54:25
Makes sense. Thanks!

I am wildly underqualified to help with the technical aspect of your query, so I will instead offer to “help” by offering condolences and a picture of my cat. He has extra toes and that tends to cheer people up.
My condolences.

I can’t speak from experience, but I believe it usually takes a couple of days.

*Assuming there is no such a thing as a full-on crash that kills BTC and that its long-term value will continue to climb* (and you just have to decide to be comfortable with assuming this), I think a fair market price of BTC at the moment is between $11K and $12K.
Disclaimer part 1: I have no idea what I’m doing
Disclaimer part 2: but I haven’t lost money yet
Disclaimer part 3: but I also really want to believe I’m right 
Disclaimer part 4: and literally no one has any idea what’s going on

I’ve noticed that slow days on the BTC daily often mean something big is brewing.

The only people on crypto threads I consider delusional are the ones who make confident predictions speaking in absolutes. If you're not smart enough to end basically everything you say about price with "But really who fucken knows?", you're probably not smart enough to have made an accurate prediction. 
Now if you're willing to call it what it is (a guess) and able to give me your reasons, I'm listening...
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:09:34
Oh my god with this fucken crap again

That's what I'm seeing, and I'm honestly 50-50 torn about buying in - not for any life-altering amount I couldn't afford to lose, obviously. Literally have the purchase page up and staring me in the face, haha. I'm no seasoned investor, but I have been trying my hand at a few things and lurking on this sub for a few months. My limited context and itchy trigger finger are telling me to go for it. I think.

I started with a couple thousand in “initial investment” when I thought BTC seemed low and have been DCAing since, and I haven’t been disappointed. Compromise on the “pure gamble versus smart strategy” aspect, put your initial investment down now or soon and DCA from there.

I assumed it was an acronym for Hold On for Dear Life...
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:53:20
I would think it would go the other way, since the majority of people I know get tax returns and spend them frivolously on things like crypto investments.
Not that I intend to do this or anything...

Not clear on what you mean by “access via selling.” Do you mean turn it back into USD in your bank account right away?
