People are buying them trough local sellers and services like bitinstant. Thanks to reddit I was aware of the risk I was taking with my purchases on bitinstant. I decided to try it with small amounts at first to minimize my losses. I suggest you look around the subreddit and you'll find plenty of good advise. A lot of helpful people here.

I already have 2 factor authentication on my email account, but I didn't know you can access the backup with the wallet identifier. Will keep that in mind. thank you

Has anyone even taken the time to look and see that the volatility is decreasing? The numbers seem to get bigger but it's an illusion. (If you start talking about percentage/logarithmic) The increase from $1 to $30 was a huge spike, but it's not as much as the increase from $10 to $260. Sure it was bigger in price but not in percentage of the overall market.

No, just add a barcode to the bills.. Just like paper wallets
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:31:51
wait, if i transfer strait to mt.gox it deposits usd's into my mt.gox account? then i can buy bitcoins there on my own time? i thought it deposited btc.
thanks again friend

That's what I was expecting. There could be fees I was completely unaware of, or just the volatile nature of the young market.  The money isn't as important as figuring out what's going on so that users like me can be a bit more confident in the service.

Your forgetting the hoops you had to jump through to even be able to have a card.
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:01:21
I didn't know that thanks
@_date: 2013-10-21 23:37:43
With QE3 they are "printing" the equivalent of ~40 bitcoin markets a month so there's that... :/
@_date: 2013-10-21 23:49:58
You don't need to do that unless you want bigger volume and instant delivery.
@_date: 2013-10-21 23:23:03
It's a private deal outside of the exchanges.. Bitcoin users not affected. Not until they decide to dump it at least.
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:59:17
Right, but what about my second purchase? I was given a rate of $95 when the market didn't hit those prices until after I had the bitcoins in my account. It's almost like they shorted the bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-08-31 18:01:34
You're right, it is better in the end. That doesn't change my opinion that MtGox is having some troubles that will get passed down to the users in a worst case scenario. Coinbase is my preferred exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:49:02
I didn't know this, but that's why I'm here, thanks for the tips. Going to go look up your post history and try to find out more.
@_date: 2013-10-04 17:37:04
The latest is hilarious. It's a message to the staff (FBI staff) that the address is compromised, that they should transfer it to an address provided in the note. The senders address I suppose. Faith in Social engineering lol
@_date: 2013-10-21 23:29:06
Is your device jailbroken? If so, the original blockchain.info wallet is pretty sweet. It has secondary passwords and email backups after every transaction.
@_date: 2013-10-07 03:06:27
Coinbase is not an exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:52:36
You don't need to be verified for a cash deposit, but what about a cash withdrawal? Better to withdraw BTC from mt.gox and get usd's from a third party?
@_date: 2013-05-14 12:44:00
Beat me to it mate :)
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:35:22
My fault.
1:05pm utc or 8 am central
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:55:22
Maybe the math checks out when you transfer to mt.gox? Is that what you did? I'm learning now that my mistake was transferring straight to wallet
@_date: 2013-10-21 17:18:55
And the pizza heavy portfolio pays off for the speculative trader! Woop woop woop!
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:43:02
Good question, I would like to know how their whole business model goes. What's the process? I would just love a way to lock in an exchange rate. What frustrated me more than losing a couple dollars, is not knowing why or where they went. Inconsistencies  drive me crazy. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 05:13:57
Tip, if its older than a few hours, it's been posted. Thanks anyway, I'm sure there's people who haven't seen it.
@_date: 2013-10-08 14:55:17
No you weren't.. OP wasnt trying to buy bitcoins, so coinbase canceling his purchase makes no sence. he was trying to withdraw bitcoin he already owns.
@_date: 2013-10-04 17:29:05
Over and over again? Real Bitcoin scam track record: 0. Yes people have been scammed before but that has little to do with bitcoin itself. Scammers use bitcoin as a tool just as they have been doing with dollars all along. So what scams are you referring to?
@_date: 2013-10-21 23:13:58
Oh no! Guys what have we done! We should turn back for the sake of comedy. I don't want to grow up in a world were I have to say "I'm laughing all the way to the blockchain" ... See that's not funny at all! What have we done! Think of the children.
@_date: 2013-10-19 19:44:12
Also, it's in the side bar.
@_date: 2013-09-06 15:51:15
I dont think you understand paper wallets.. It's the public key that's visible
@_date: 2013-08-31 10:00:37
It is beneficial for Mt.Gox as they are trying to comply with financial regulations, but not beneficial for us that never planned on moving USDs from the exchange. Verification isn't needed to withdraw bitcoin. At least not until you get flagged for something as simple as accessing Mt.Gox from 2 different IPs. Non verified accounts are stuck using mt.gox from only one device on one network. How fucked up is that? They waited until I deposited bitcoins and then locked me out of them. Not USDs, bitcoin.. They won't let me withdraw bitcoin because I used my account from my phone and my pc. 2 different IPs..
Oh, and the liquidity problems is why I suggest he stay away from Gox..
@_date: 2013-10-21 23:46:46
Even if the recipient has a different bank?
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:20:44
Only reason to keep money on Bitstamp (exchange) is if you're a day trader.
@_date: 2013-07-26 11:30:19
Yeah I might be one of those reasons, it helps in protecting my account I guess but now my bitcoin are trapped. I never planned in using fiat and now I feel like they're keeping my bitcoin hostage so that I get verified
@_date: 2013-05-14 13:34:03
Woah buddy, it just a comment. A simple up vote would've been enough I guess. Of course a simple downvote would've been enough from you but here we are... 
@_date: 2013-10-07 12:42:04
That's exactly why it matters. If its not an exchange, there really isn't any benefit to keeping your bitcoin at a coinbase wallet. OP not being able to withdraw his bitcoin only confirms this in my opinion. He would be much better off keeping his bitcoin in a local wallet like cipher_gnome recommended.
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:29:00
tell me more about this "premium"
is that like a hidden fee for transferring strait to wallet? I wasnt going to trade with the btc what is the benefit of going to mt.gox? can i withdraw anonymously  from mt.gox?
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:22:28
Same thing just happened to me on coinbase! I hope it's a coinbase bug and not a bitcoin bug! Now I'm worried
@_date: 2013-09-06 15:39:40
True, but it's no different that walking around with cash.. You would only have a small amounts on the paper wallets since you would have to empty the whole wallet when you use it. A different wallet with only .o1 BTC in each? Think of it as printing your own bills.
I was talking about the image anyway.. Not as in actually go and walk around flashing you wallets to everyone
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:21:34
Well gotta admit that's pretty cool, but it doesn't make up for the other limitations imposed by banks. Why only North America and EU? Why not send to Africa for free? Or Asia, South America? If someone was on the moon and had a strong enough radio, I could transact with them with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-21 11:10:02
Actually if you are jailbroken you can still download the original.. I use it on my phone and on my iPad. It's pretty good IMO.
@_date: 2013-05-14 12:58:16
Thank you for the info :)
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:56:28
It makes sense, but its not what I and a lot of other user have experienced. Also, take note that I used the straight to wallet feature, not to mt.gox or any other party
@_date: 2013-08-13 22:20:41
No fix... verify, get your assets, and get as far away from MtGox as you can. Your welcome
