and then the thief double spends with an even higher fee which means in the end none of you will get the coins because the fee will be 100%.
OP is entirely correct the code does exactly what he says and this has been the case since forever.
but double spenders can directly connect to the big mining pools and directly send their transaction to them and hope that some of them are greedy dicks running modified software that will drop transactions for ones with higher fees, like the one that was run by the old or new cex.io admins for at least a day.

a 100k subscriber sub can't have hordes of noobs asking the same questions every day.
especially because that's what trolls do to slow down our constructive discussions or push relevant threads out of sight.
noobs are basically facilitating a human DDoS on bitcoin development through their laziness.
there is a FAQ, a wiki, moronic monday and for a reason - to stop wasting hours and hours of mantime.
dear noobs: put in some fucking effort of your own or fuck you.

haha doesn't matter, I'll just repost :p
it's usually that a few trolls are watching new threads and give a few downvotes to anti-troll posts and sheeple will then jump onto the downvote train.
usually after i repost i get quite a lot of upvotes because the trolls miss the repost :p
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:59:09
no shit. this was all posted immediately when they posted their scam threads.
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:41:45
well just import your key in another client and send again...
@_date: 2014-04-18 17:41:07
what? you can just look through my post history if you want proof that i reposted...
fun fact: today someone made a thread about how to deal with trolls and skeptics and consensus was that insulting those who are just trolling and telling them to gtfo is exactly what should be done.
consensus in another thread was that if a noob posts a stupid question it is ok to point them to other subs, google or the wiki and be rude if they refuse to go there.
no idea what problem the haters in this thread here got, but it's interesting to see so much concentrated manipulation and stupidity in one place :D

**welcome to reddit, op**
sorry for saying this, but there have been plenty of scammers here so please provide some sort of proof that you are the operator of this tor node.

if the server is compromised your coins are already gone forever.
therefore server is not compromised and OP is a massive douchebag spreading FUD. 
instead of telling people to secure their machines against malware he's telling them to access their bitcoins from potentially infected machines.
at least he added the line to disable javascript  before logging in so he's *probably* not trying to steal anyone's coins.

funnily enough a redditor called ReddHerring used a similar trick to get people to run the mtgox leak malware on linux. is there some manual those guys are following?
tbh maybe OP is honest, but FT_clox_meetoo who is a legit redditor was the first person to ask for source and got downvoted simply for asking for evidence (OP just talked about hacks but did not link to any posts until multiple people asked) which is quite suspicious imho.
i think he or the automoderation bot deleted his post now.

a 51% attack doesn't matter, it can't change the protocol or steal funds or whatever.
don't feed the troll. downvote and ignore.

**first of all: welcome to reddit, OP**
so where are all the reddit threads from all the people who got their coins stolen?
and isn't XSS a vulnerability that can only be abused when you log in to localbitcoins AND have javascript enabled?
what if the IRC is how the hacker abuses the flaw?
my bullshit detector is on 2/3.
@_date: 2014-04-17 18:51:59
upvoting because obviously someone is behind the alternations of FUD spam and DDoS attacks but the news could be fabricated/blown out of proportion by western dicks too.
this reminds me of the palantírs in lotr where sauron controlled what people saw so they thought everything looked grim and hopeless because they didn't see the bigger picture.
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:01:17
it is somewhat similar because it requires user interaction:
if it is malware then the bug needs people to log in to LB
if it is XSS the bug needs people to click on malicious links (for example links posted in IRC/forum or sent by PM or posted on other sites).
if it is an inside job then all coins are already gone and whatever balance you see is wrong. there is nothing you can do and OP's post came too late.
in either case, moving bitcoins from LB while you are vulnerable to attacks is a bad idea, just like using an infected doge client to send coins from your doge wallet is fucking retarded.
use linux and NoScript.

**THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD NEWS**
All SSL certificates everywhere are being revoked atm because of Heartbleed.
That's why https connections might be a bit slow at the moment - it's amazing that this works at all, the whole infrastructure to do such a thing has only been put in place recently and is untested on such a scale, not to mention the CPU power required to create such an amount of new SSL certificates. I hope the CAs don't compromise on key length.
This is similar in scale to a massive blockchain fork - everything is broken and you don't know what to trust.
**Any website (and possibly every onion service) that does not change its certificate (change address) IS UNSAFE!**

well all parties would know about the double spend unless the miners write software that accepts double spends but keeps those transactions secret.
as soon as someone sees a double spend he can just triple/quadruple/quintuple/... spend it with a higher fee, assuming there are miners that accept this sort of thing.
in theory they shouldn't, because of self-interest.
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:28:01
what the fuck are you talking about?
you can't force protocol changes with 51% or even 100% unless the people running the clients agree with it.
whoever upvoted this garbage should be ashamed to himself and go back to the wiki.
downvoted and reported.
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:22:28
well, miners should only accept the first transaction they receive.
after a few (milli)seconds every node in the network will have received the first transaction.
then someone receives his goods in a brick-and-mortar shop, runs out of the door, launches his app and sends a double spend. 
if he had sent the double spend right away then the vendor would have seen it if he is connected to a large enough number of nodes with the current code or any node when the code gets changed to relay double spend transactions to make them easier to detect.
@_date: 2014-04-17 18:28:40
but it isn't a currency in the US or germany or many other countries either and most central banks advice against using it as a currency or using it at all and many vendors still accept it here oO
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:46:27
that's not how it works lol.
if you politely tell them to look for answers elsewhere they will just be as cocky as if you insult them, maybe even more.
your mentality is exactly why big subs always turn to shit. congrats for being part of the problem.

re-encrypting is no use, if they got your wallet or keys they got your wallet or keys.
if you are worried about your coins send them to a new address in a new wallet (bitcoin pregenerates 100 addresses by default).
but no, you don't need to unless what hanlam says applies.
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:44:04
because dogecoin is an entirely different ecosystem lol.
and if you spend more time on the frontpage than on /new/ i feel sorry for your ignorant manipulated ass.

if it's an inside job all coins would disappear at the same moment and not require any user interaction.
localbitcoins does not move coins between hot/cold storage whenever a user logs in and out lol.
 it most likely wouldn't be visible in the user balance either because it isn't locked to your addresses.
this is most likely just regular malware.
