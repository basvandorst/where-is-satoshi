I have time to make a road trip and visiting a solar bitcoin mining farm sounds like an interesting destination.  I don't need anything.  I care about everything.
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:59:28
I must have missed it, can you show me the proof?
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:01:39
Do you really think you will be able to tell the difference?  If I were you, I would buy some cheap headphones and revisit this when they break.  But for all I know, you are a musician and headphone quality is everything.
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:11:32


  
Fuck you, Dan.  You offered to show your farm and have avoided it at every turn.  You accuse me of demanding you arrange your schedule and that is clearly a lie if you look at our interactions because I have been trying to conform to your schedule the whole time.  Anyone looking at our interactions objectively will see that.
  
I hope your proof is irrefutable because I am not going to be quiet. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 18:03:47
As we discussed yesterday and as I re-iterated in my previous reply.  We where to meet on the 8th.  I also told you I need a 5 day lead time.  I also made it clear I am coming from central California so there is no way we can meet today.
  
If you can't meet on the 8th to show me your farm, please propose a day that we can meet and an itinerary with some sort of schedule so that we can come to an agreement.  I think everyone watching will agree this is fair.

I hope that if you hoped for obscurity that you wouldn't be making multiple submissions about the thing you want to obscure.
@_date: 2017-07-01 03:10:52
Because they want to control their own chain.  Every offering to upgrade or improve bitcoin on their part has always included a hard fork, no exceptions.  If they win and control the bitcoin chain without friction then there you go, that is their incentive.  If they end up splitting on a minority chain, then they all have a new chain to play with.  People backing this like Silbert have demonstrated they are incentivized by money from thin air like they received from the ETH\ETC split.  This is about money.
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:10:15


Your actions say otherwise and your submission history shows a desire to be known and believed.  It is kind of fishy if you look at your history objectively.
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:29:10
Did you not read my reply?  Can you reply to it in your thread and not this joke one?

My address isn't relevant.  I'm not the one trying to convince anyone of anything here.  You are the one offering a story that is drawing doubt.  I'm willing to come document what you are saying.  If you don't want to take me up on this then I can't do anything else to help.
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:20:38
Fuck off, Dan.  I found your Borrego bullshit too.  I'll be contacting that golf course owner as well.

@_date: 2017-07-02 20:49:08


I'm not trying to insult you but I think you are confused.  By asking you to pick a day and time, I am conforming to your schedule.  I am trying to do this when it is convenient for you.  Otherwise I would be demanding we meet on a specific day and time and I am not doing that.
  
You could pick any day and time at least 5 or more days out and you are calling me unreasonable.  That makes no sense.  You know your schedule, I don't.
@_date: 2017-07-01 16:41:00
Specifically into activating a hard fork.  They could activate segwit right now if they wanted to but they are trying to use segwit to blackmail us into a hard fork. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 21:31:41
The Bitcoin symbol has also been included in unicode 10.0.  I'm not aware of any unicode symbols that aren't public domain.
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:36:10
So they still hard fork.  Then there is nothing to prevent them from disabling segwit on their chain or the main chain if they should win.  So those who want segwit are naturally opposed.
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:47:49
I've been where you are now and I regretted it.  If there is any way for you to be patient and buy your headphones using fiat, do it.  You will be happy later if bitcoin continues to go up over time because otherwise you may look back and regret spending the bitcoin.  I've lost thousands of dollars in gains by spending my bitcoin when I didn't have to.

Great, I'd love to see a vertical solar mining farm and an opportunity to show you that I am not an asshole.
  
Can you please just pick a day at least 5 days out and commit to a schedule so we can come to an agreement?  I'm offering to drive half way across the state to check out your farm and I haven't asked anything from you.  We need to agree on a schedule because there is no way I can make a return trip in the same day.  So I am likely going to have to drive the day before and stay in a hotel and possibly stay in a hotel again that night depending on how early you want to meet.  I need to plan this out.  I can't just hop in the car and hope for the best, I don't live like that.  And it would likely cost me more money playing it by ear.  And I am not being difficult or unreasonable.
  
I am semi-retired right now and have a lot of time on my hands so I can be very flexible.
  
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:45:35
I believe you are easily manipulated.
@_date: 2017-07-04 18:46:28
I submitted this as its own topic but automod may have grabbed it.
Dan posted this video of his farm: 
New video link because the one he posted has been mysteriously removed: 
And I believe I have found his "farm". It is one shipping container on a golf course and the solar panels look to be for the golf course.
So from this, I am going to guess this "vertical mining farm" is for the golf course and Dan works there. I wonder if they know he has bitcoin miners in there. The fish are obviously for the large pond.










I've been through the video several times and I am 100% certain it was shot on the property I linked.
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:31:26
I live in California and would be happy to come visit and take pictures and video for proof.  What is the address?
@_date: 2017-07-01 15:33:48
Obviously to get miners to follow them.

Amazon gift cards might be quicker then.  But then you might also end up with a gift card that has some amount of money left over that you have a hard time spending.

Don't forget that if Core did it, especially if Core did it, they would be accused of being irresponsible.  And rightfully so.

We can speculate all we want but we must always return to their actions.  Their actions are why we are here discussing this, let's not forget that.
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:30:33


Blocks only "seem" full (if you don't actually look at them) because spammers have been padding them to try to force the block size limit up since earlier this year. If you check the actual transactions, you'll see there's only about 400k/block average that are actually meant to transfer bitcoins around. The volume seems to grow about 10k/block/month for a while.
  
For context: Luke called out the spam transactions as they were happening.
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:55:40
Alright, Dan.  I'm calling you a fraud now.  Call me an asshole or whatever but you are clearly trying to evade showing anyone your farm after offering to show your farm.  That is a huge red flag.  I have been very reasonable and offered both my time and money to come see something that sounds awesome.  I could have been an advocate for you here with very little effort on your part but you are avoiding it.  I must assume you are a lair.  I am sorry, but this is the internet and big claims require evidence.  Your story draws too much doubt and you continue to show that you cannot back up what you claim.  Future submissions with grand claims that are not backed up will be met with hostility from me.  I apologize in advance.
@_date: 2017-07-04 19:12:35
I grabbed the video, just looking for a place to host it right now.

Heya, did you miss my reply yesterday?
  
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:29:08
If you look at the ETH\ETC split and how Coinbase handled it, it is reasonable to assume you will have coins on whatever chains survive.  But this is not a guarantee and you should wait for Coinbase to make a statement.  They will make a statement.  They can't not.
@_date: 2017-07-02 01:08:36
That is not up to me but I am fine with it if Dan is.
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:23:45
I'd prefer to meet at your farm.  You're implying you will be busy all day on campus which makes it sound like we won't be going to your farm.  I understand you might want to meet somewhere public first for safety and I am down with that.  But I need commitments from you about itinerary.  And since I don't know your schedule.  Can you please provide one here that we can come to agreement on?
Something like:  
  
Meet at starbucks location x at 10am.
Go to farm at 10:30am.
Tour farm from 11am to 12pm
Something like that so I know what I am getting into.  I think that is fair.
@_date: 2017-07-01 15:37:00
He seriously said they don't want to disrupt the test network.  THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE HAVE A TEST NETWORK!!!
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:55:15
You didn't offer to meet me.  Did you offer to meet someone at your farm so they can document your story?  I don't feel like looking through your history again.
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:57:22


There is.  The economic incentive is to not attack bitcoin so overtly that a significant portion leaves.  They cannot simply attack and claim victory, people will flee and they will be left holding the bag.  They have to do it with as little friction as possible. 
  
I'm open to the possibility they don't have the hash power to do it and this is all bluff to game the market.  But then they are still my enemy since I am a market participant affected by their actions.
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:39:26
It isn't about the size, it is about the justification.  All solutions that are proposed include segwit and any block increase right now, before we have a chance to see how segwit impacts blocks would be arbitrary.  Core will not make arbitrary changes.  They need to be backed by data and since all proposed paths forward include segwit, we have to wait and see the impact before we can make a decision that isn't arbitrary.
  
So demanding a block increase before we see how segwit affects the blocks is irresponsible and core doesn't make arbitrary and irresponsible commits.
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:57:06
Did you read my reply?  I said I would prefer to meet at your farm but I am alright with meeting somewhere first before going to your farm.  But I need an itinerary from you as a commitment.  To clarify, you had said that we could meet Saturday the 8th.

That's five pictures inside a metal box.  He has not taken anyone up on their offer to come visit him and verify.
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:09:00
Let's arrange it now in public so everyone knows it is happening.  I think we would both feel safer knowing outside eyes were aware.
  
I am fine with keeping your address and identity secret, we can do that in PMs.
  
I am available every day to come visit but I would like about 5 days lead time.
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:52:47
  
Here is the reply.  I disagree that I am being tough.  Not wanting to drive 10 hours to southern California with no firm commitment on your part is just smart.

Hey how come you haven't address [this comment](
  
You made [this comment]( 17 minutes ago which is 20 minutes later.  Are you ignoring it??  Why would you do that?
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:17:27
I have told you multiple times now that I need 5 days lead time, I am coming from central California and I need a date and itinerary we can agree to.  Also, Tuesday is the 4th of July and I have plans.  If you can't pick a day 5 days out and commit to times then I have assume you are a liar.  This is a really simple task for someone capable of what you claim.  I have been nothing but reasonable.
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:43:39
At that point there is nothing stopping them from hard forking again.  Why do you always try appealing to ignorance?  Is it because you know that you cannot win over critical thinkers?
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:03:20
Great!  I am interested in seeing a bitcoin mining farm.  Obviously this weekend is already here so let's schedule it for this week or next weekend?  I'm open to times.  I need your address so I can plan out a trip.  I am in central California so I have a drive ahead of me that will not allow for a same day return trip.
@_date: 2017-07-01 03:00:37

You look like you have a strong desire to be believed.  That was the only reason I offered.  I have to doubt your story now because you didn't take me up on my offer and you have provided no proof. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 00:42:59
Thank you for showing your perspective and in turn your intentions.  Most people here can recognize you for what you are now and that is someone who is pushing an agenda and isn't using critical thinking to move forward.  At no point did you refute my assessment that a block increase at this point given the inevitable implementation of segwit would be anything other than an arbitrary increase.  You did not justify an increase **at all**.  You argued from a position of fear and fear doesn't drive responsible actors.
  
The commits that make up the Core team have demonstrated that they will not make arbitrary and irresponsible commits and you have failed to show how a block increase before or shortly after segwit activates is anything other than arbitrary.
  


  
Additionally, I did [posit a real objections to 2 megabytes right now]( and you attempted to ignore it as shown above.
  
You need to show that a 2mb increase is justified and backed up by data, not arbitrary.  And you need to show consideration for the implications of segwit since all realistic proposed paths forward include it.

Why would Satoshi need a diversionary tactic when nobody knows who Satoshi is?  This is nonsense.  Satoshi doesn't need any kind of diversion and creating one could lead to a lapse in his anonymity so he isn't going to do it because the risk is greater than the reward.  This is ridiculous.

I don't know how you got the impression that I am an asshole or that I expect anything.  I haven't been and I don't.  Look through my history and show me where I went wrong and I will be happy to correct myself.
  
5 days lead time and a commitment on times is all I have asked for but you are unwilling to do it.  I have explained why too and my reason is valid because I have to travel far and spend money.
  
If you can't give me a date and time at least 5 or more days out then you know I cannot come so maybe this is why you refuse to do it.  You are leaving me to assume.  And many looking at this will assume the worst.  I'm trying not to but you are making it hard.
  
- I need to know what date I am to meet you and see your farm because I have to plan travel and lodging.
  
- I need to know an itinerary with times so that I can plan that day out.
  
The above is not unreasonable.
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:58:13
Are you planning to hold for a long time like years?  If so, you should just move your bitcoin to cold storage so that no matter what happens, you will have a stake in whatever chain wins and any minority chain that might survive.  Selling before hand is giving up your position and it could be more expensive to buy back in, nothing is guaranteed.

Satoshi might have been arrogant but he was quiet about it if he was.  You can call that humble but it might have just been a part of his OPSEC.  One thing is for sure, Satoshi put in considerable effort staying anonymous and keeping the spotlight on the code.  Craig Wright tried to fool people with a fake cryptographic proof and was caught.  He has done nothing but try and grab the spotlight and cause division.  He has contributed nothing.  He is attacking Satoshi Nakamoto by trying to claim his identity.  I hope it gets him a punch in the face at the very least.
