For fuck's sake grow up kid, read a book or two before you make an argument.
Forcing people to use a service and then claiming they need to pay because they used that service is bullshit.


If you have to pay 40% of your yearly income the tax can increase by 422%. After the increase you pay 168.8% of what you make in a year. Shouldn't be too hard to grasp


This just shows that you have no idea how hard opening a business or a bank account in a foreign country as an ex-US citizen really is.

You have a misunderstanding of anarcho-capitalism and libertarianism. Anarcho-capitalists don't support violence as a means of ending the state. They support a slow transition into a completely free market (through crypto-currencies for example). 
So no, this is not a libertarian wet dream, far from it. This violence is a direct response to a corrupt government not some anarcho-capitalists wanting a free market.


People are rational in that they'll always do what profits them the most. If I'm not mistaken your government was corrupt as fuck, so demonstrating and getting a new government seemed like a good idea to them.
In a free market the russians would have had a much harder time, because you would actually pay for your own safety. There would be companies offering protection (and actual contracts that require them to defend you contrary to the 'contract' you have with the police and the army).


You use army as if there is only 1 kind of army. Libertarians are not against self defense and probably understand that at the moment the army should be used for self defense (which is completely different from using an army to invade foreign countries). But the ultimate goal is to have defense companies compete against each other to actually get a decent service for what you pay.
I live in a direct democracy (switzerland) and it's shit. There's corruption, there are lots of monopolies, the presidents (we got 7 of them) do in no way respect the people and decide against the will of the people on a daily basis. The police is racist as fuck and doesn't really feel that they need to protect you.

Good argument. I really have to reevaluate my life now. /s
How is self defense in any way comparable to agression? Also I never argued that violence is a solution, I mainly pointed out that self defense against a company that posses a threat is not agression but self defense.
As I said, not buying a product or service from a company is a completly non-violent way of not supporting a company that does stuff you don't like. If enough people don't support that company it will have a hard time surviving. 
Countless people support and have supported the free market. There's even a complete school of economics called austrian economics that supports laissez-faire capitalism.

I agree with you that just because pricate defense companies exist nothing would have happened. But consider this: How did Putin get money? He took it from his own people through taxation.

It's not run by the government. There are literally 20 companies that offer basic health coverage.
Essentially it works like this:
You have to buy basic insurance which doesn't cover a lot (dentist completly not covered, they only pay a percentage of the price if it's a small amount, etc.) From a private company (so yes there's price competition). The company is not allowed to make profit on the basic insurance. However because basic insurance doesn't cover a lot of stuff you normally buy a special health insurance from the company you buy your basic coverage from. So theres competition between many companies and the companies have an incentive to lower prices on basic insurance to get customers because chances are they'll buy extra health insurance from the same company.
Big business is not necessarily free market. Government regulation and taxing actually helps established companies and prevents alternative startups from competing with big business. That's why big business is paying politicians a shit ton of money and is sometimes in favor of regulation.

There was a 500 comment discussion over at @_date: 2014-12-13 20:55:14
The fact that people wouldn't support a company that did such things. We actually decide lots of stuff based on reviews by other people. Amazon product reviews, yelp, the ebay rating system etc.
Chances are if people are unhappy with a company a smart mind will see a profit opportunity and build a company that provides the same product but tries to refrain from doing the shit people don't like about the other company.
There's no reason why there couldn't be a company or organization that does medication and food testing. In fact it's rather lucrative to be a company that approves stuff and makes sure a product meets a certain quality standard. I know I would want food inspectors in my restaurant if I can put a sign up saying that company XY checked my restaurant.
Regarding the environment:
To just point out that in a free market companies would poison the environment and therefore a free market is a bad idea seems like a bad argument to me. It's not like we have this issue under control right now even if the government tries to regulate a lot. The NAP (Non-Aggression principle) actually could be applied to environmental damage and therefore under the NAP self defense against poisoning the environment wouldn't be seen as attacking but rather as defending. At least if your own property or you as a human beings have to suffer because of a company. I think if you let people innovate they'll come up with smart solutions (like electric cars). If there's no regulation smart people are free to innovate and society will generally support the companies that innovate and try to reduce environmental damage. Tesla can't sell cars directly in some states. This hinders there ability to expand their target audience. You can't really sell an electric car in the same place as a normal car. They are fundamentally different products in terms of the technology behind it. It makes no sense what so ever to not allow Tesla to sell their cars directly to customers. This is the kind of regulation that stops innovation and therefore stops us from finding more viable solutions that are not only solutions but that are actually good enough that people will invest in them and see the benefits.

This is a common myth. Banking made and makes up only aroynd 11% of the GDP. The big economic boom switzerland had after WW2 is largely based on the fact that switzerland was one of the only countries with an intact infrastructure after the war. I'll agree that the bankieg sector contributed and still contributes to the high standard of living. It's not theft though. People put what they rightfully own into swiss bank accounts. Just because a foreign government thinks it has the right to take that money doesn't mean protecting it is stealing. You can't steal what is yours already.

Producing child porn always requires the use of force/aggression (Unless you wanna argue that children can give consent).
Producing drugs doesn't necessarily involve any force/aggression. In fact growing opium is the main income of many families in Afghanistan for example. There's no inherent coercion/aggression/use of force in producing drugs.
So apart from the fact that both are illegal (which doesn't mean they are both immoral, unjust or unethical) there's not much in common between the production of those 2 goods.

Government intervention (through manipulation of money supply) is part of Keynesian economics and there are other school of thoughts in economics that reject the idea of Monetarism.

When you say "government intervention is helping flattening out boom and bust cycles (or at least government intervention is necessary)" you are making a rather big assumption. You are limiting yourself to one economic school of thought.
There's also Real Business cycle theory. RBCT argues that boom and bust cycles are completly natural and that government intervention is not necessary. I haven't looked too much into it but RBCT also rejects Keynsian economics and Monetarism.

While child porn distribution is definitely something I'm against (because producing such content requires force/coercion/aggression against children or a different age of consent which is something we can discuss but I don't think anything less than maybe 15 makes any sense) I'll always support systems (but not necessarily all actors in such a system) that allow people to trade without interference.
What would be interesting is whether access to child porn reduces actual child abuse or not. If it reduces child abuses people might wanna start advocating legalization of computer generated child porn (which is still illegal in many countries).

Because M80s have been used for pest control for many decades and I personally use them for exactly that (Up to 2Gramm ones). Sure you have to pay attention but to compare them to TNT is stupid. You can make bombs using chemicals readily available in nearly every household if you know what you are doing.


Sure. And selling m80 is illegal in the US. Doesn't change the fact that speaking of explosives is misleading if you actually look at where the m80s are used. They are still legal in many countries exactly because they are useful for many things apart from just blowing stuff up. What's really important is the volume of an explosive in relation to it's explosive potential. Everyone can build bombs that create a rather large force. The question is how big that bomb is gonna be, so just because something can in fact be explosive doesn't mean that it should be illegal.

Every time you make a transaction from your bank account to another and it takes 2-3 days it's not because it actually takes that long to make the transaction (which is done digitally today anyway it takes seconds for a bank to send money to another bank account) but because the banks want you to give them control over the money for 2-3 days.
