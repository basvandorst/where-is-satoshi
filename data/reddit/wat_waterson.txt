Have you ever tried to go off the grid?
Per your reference in Paris, when I search for "Internet Cafe Paris" I get back 9,120 results. Granted, if I were to sift through those results, I'd whittle that number down significantly, but that's still a large amount of results for actual places of businesses that have some sort of wifi. Not to mention the amount of open wifi networks that are likely to still exist (here is data from 2006: [ I'm sure the number is still decent enough to where I could hop on open, WEP or WPS enabled WPA wifi. I imagine that there are schools and libraries in Paris that have free internet access as well.
Niger Delta, Iran, Syria: did you pay attention to Egypt where people were getting the message out via Twitter or other means after all of Egypt pretty much went black? They continued to do so till the rebellion was over, and to top it off *the reason they were able to do that is because they were using the same internet pipes as the Egyptian government* and they still didn't get caught. They were customers with the same ISP as the Egyptian Government and they weren't found.
I'd have a difficult time in any of these countries/regions you've described, but a native with something to fear from it's government and a willingness to not get caught wouldn't.

How am I being demographically small minded? I don't even.

Use a LiveCD instead of making it complicated.

No, but the point is, that they did not get caught when they were basically operating on the same pipes as the government, not that they were in Starbucks.
Apparently Iran decides to fuck my whole argument up by announcing they are putting cameras in every internet cafe today.

Also, it preys on the default wallet.dat file, if you move it, it won't matter. You can add to this script so it will search for "wallet.dat" in any directory as well, not sure why the author just left it for the default location.

This is what I get for not properly reading the rules for the bounty. I'm the asshole hammering some of your services right now, I'll send my feedback sometime tonight.
