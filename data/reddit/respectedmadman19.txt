I'm quite sure that even if it falls for the rest of this month, when the new year starts and people aren't so busy with all the Christmas stresses the price will go up again

I feel like we need a bitcoin HODL shanty.
Almost like a pirate shanty.
But you know, one for bitcoin.

I'm not claiming to have seen Hamilton, and I'm not American so the context is even more hazy for me but are you telling me: 
if I as a black person, started benefiting monetarily from (for example) wearing native American style clothing (another ethnic minority) without giving them any props (I saw someone said he gave props to Biggie) - that wouldn't be  cultural appropriation?!

That's kinda what I mean, it's an expensive time of the year. Monetary stress and sometimes mental stress too getting things prepared or travelling to meet family etc

Everyone also needs to remember it's almost Christmas. People need cash flow this month too. There was always going to be a good chance off major dip this month regardless of the coinbase/Bcash drama
