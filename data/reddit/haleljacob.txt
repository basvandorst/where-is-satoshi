You know not all economists work for the government?

I thought we just agreed that morality and laws were separate.

If your worried about governments trying to forge your opinion you might want to look beyond the internet. There's lot's of ways they can get to you in the real world that are far more direct. Luckily you can protect yourself from most of that by establishing a protective metal covering around where your brain is to block out opinion forging rays, almost like a hat.

The 90 year old second richest man in the world who is already giving away billions to charity is very worried about losing money yes I'm sure that's it.

Doc.. I... I find it amusing to read posts by deluded people on the internet... I think I might be a psychopath.
@_date: 2014-10-13 14:35:13


seems reasonable
@_date: 2014-11-02 22:49:49
what is this in regards to?
@_date: 2014-05-26 23:25:04
sounds good to me
@_date: 2014-09-01 01:23:04
I'm not paid. I do it because bitcoin is about liberty and I want to bring down liberty because of reasons.

This is a new segment on the show where is guests hold up "confessions" that he wrote for them. Think dog shaming or child shaming on reddit. The guy holding the sign didn't write what is written on it
@_date: 2014-08-23 01:52:38
Of course I don't, why would I?
@_date: 2014-09-01 03:51:03
trolls, leprachauns, unicorns, it doesn't matter. They're just people who disagree with you.
@_date: 2014-12-04 20:40:46
lol what
@_date: 2014-09-21 23:07:06
children are expensive. That was the point. People do not have children for profit. Even poor people.

Of course it was funny didn't you see him alomaloling?
@_date: 2014-09-01 04:07:46
good thing that's never happened then.
@_date: 2014-09-01 03:45:06
It's actually much easier to locate a thread and comment on it than you might think. Even if a person posts a comment or two every 3 hours that might only be 5-6 minutes of their day, with much of it of course spent doing other things on reddit. As for the second part about the yes/no question thing, I don't care.
@_date: 2014-09-22 00:37:31
that's not even anecdotal because there's no story.
@_date: 2014-09-01 01:21:50
You certainly cleared that up...

I personally make about 500 bitcoin a year. It's not that much but we all know how much it will be worth next year so it's worth it.

the term 'statist' is comparable to terms like 'theist' and 'cisgendered'
@_date: 2014-09-21 22:48:13
Ah because only white people can love their children
@_date: 2015-05-30 21:06:21


So because reasons
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:36:05
Is that in crisis? How would bitcoins fix it?
@_date: 2015-01-27 04:57:36
There's more to life than doing what you want
@_date: 2015-01-27 00:16:21
Slightly less important issue, where to eat, versus in who's hands you put your life. Of course the government does keep a record of the health and safety aspects of restaurants, luckily.

Do you not support the establishment of the FDA?

Dude you're too much
@_date: 2015-01-27 02:08:14
Do you not trust a licensed doctor?
@_date: 2015-01-27 00:02:38
If you want to see an unlicensed doctor in the sense that you want to see someone who claims they can heal you sure that's your right. It is not that persons right to call themselves a doctor as this can mislead people to believe he or she has the skills of a licensed doctor. If you want to see an unlicensed doctor who claims to have all the skills of a licensed doctor then I would not call you a competent adult.
@_date: 2015-01-03 08:00:45
This is actually good news for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-27 02:09:20
You've official made an insane claim. I bid you farewell.
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:45:36
Have you thought about using Actual Money?
@_date: 2015-01-26 23:59:15
I thought libertarians liked guns?
@_date: 2015-05-25 02:26:55
That must be it
@_date: 2015-01-27 04:14:03
I get it you're a libertarian, there's not much I can do about that
@_date: 2015-01-27 00:00:07
How else does one verify skill except by review from a central expert authority?
@_date: 2014-08-21 06:00:46
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:48:39
Right because people totally shouldn't need a stupid license to do something easy like being a doctor.
@_date: 2015-07-03 20:39:47
lol wat
@_date: 2015-04-24 16:56:17
This is the point I came here to make
@_date: 2015-04-30 13:26:04
Wow they weren't kidding you guys really do believe this stuff
@_date: 2015-04-02 22:01:11
The average reader.
@_date: 2015-04-11 20:00:14
Nothing is holding bitcoin back except bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2015-04-01 23:54:24


This part made me not read the rest of your comment so you might want to take it out.
@_date: 2015-04-04 01:17:58
Wait people are just *giving money* to Snowden? Why?
@_date: 2015-04-11 14:50:46
What go to jail for using a certain forbidden arrangement of atoms that just happens to fire another arrangement of atoms into what the state arbitrarily defines as "another person"?
Oh No You pulled the forbidden arrangement of atoms!!!
@_date: 2015-04-03 23:28:07
You're right. I really feel like credit cards are the money of the future.
@_date: 2015-04-28 00:40:28
Then why did you describe it as a "win-win"?
@_date: 2015-09-20 19:26:14
He said *depend* on electricity. Not use it. Also he said currency not payment platform.
@_date: 2015-03-29 05:29:16
Quite good.
@_date: 2015-03-08 18:22:28
Even if Bitcoin was super easy in an "Apple" kind of way people still wouldn't use it unless it solved a problem.
@_date: 2015-03-18 20:54:09
So the first one no one really cares about cause they've already signed up for facebook. Second one obviously doesn't matter for the users. Third one probably isn't true. Fourth one is sort of irrelevant considering facebook is offering a payment platform not a new currency. Final one is again sort of meaningless to people because they just don't care.

You're comparing trying to convince someone not to believe in something to trying to convince someone to believe in something?
@_date: 2015-10-12 00:24:12


But what then, is the real difference between these two people?
@_date: 2015-02-01 15:46:30
I bet so many people did that
@_date: 2015-03-29 06:05:53
He was smart enough that he didn't have to accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-15 02:47:50
I would imagine any community based around tech would be the same.
