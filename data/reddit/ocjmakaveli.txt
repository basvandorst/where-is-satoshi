Your completely correct a dollar backed by nothing except the promise of the usa government.  Bitcoin is backed by?  If tomorrow its value was $2 no one could explain why and you would just have code on a computer. 
If my homes go to $1 in value i still have a home to rent or live in compare that to 1s and 0s in bitcoin. The value in bitcoin is completely in peoples head. You  cant eat, sleep in or wear bitcoin. You only trade it with people who think the value will keep going up. 
Did you invest in the dot com bubble too?

Do you understand the value of a dollar isnt that one dollar is one dollar. Its how much you can buy with that one dollar. Do you understand inflation? Do you understand stability equals long term success? Bitcoin is a currency backed by nothing not even a promise of a government.  The rental homes i have increase in value and produce steady income year to year. The rents dont go up and they dont crash either. Its dependable and the value of my homes are backed by its wood and foundation. To say bitcoin will go up forever is foolish.

If the value of the dollar decreased by 5% in a day people with claim faux currency blah blah. Why then if bitcoin can fluctuate 50% in a few days is it a miracle currency of the future? Without stability currency means nothing. 
The only profit is in growing the popularity to see the price increase but once the price stabilizes in a few years there isn't much value compared to a credit card.  If i pay with credit i can get a refund but if you pay with bitcoin you do you complain to?
