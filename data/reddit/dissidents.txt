I see now, interesting.

This is probably the stupidest comment I've ever read in this subreddit. Libertarianism is not inherent greed, and philanthropy is not institutionalized welfare.

This is only natural. People are pulling out of mining because it's not as profitable as it was before. Soon, the difficulty will start going down and people will jump back on ship. This'll happen a couple times until we hit some sort of equilibrium of computation vs. profitability of mining rigs.
Most of the early mining adopters with giant rigs are going to be the ones cashing in sooner or later, because they've already covered their losses and the difficulty is going to stabilize.

This is ridiculous, why can't you use the addresses generated by a bitcoin client? This does not improve security at all.

This entire presentation and all of our discussions are not even remotely related to currency exchanges. We're talking about transactions in the network, and as the block chain gets bigger (and the amount of transactions per second increases) a more centralized model is necessary to keep the network operating properly.

I guess this is what I always expected when the entry barrier to web development became critically low.

I'm sorry, but are you and your friend in middle-school? If you want people to take this website seriously, you guys should probably take it seriously first.
What's with the obsession with bananas, and the autoplaying advertisements with awkward images scattered around the page? Have I been trolled?

People like this asshole shouldn't be allowed to exist in society. They blew it for themselves as far as I'm concerned.

Why is nobody mentioning the fact that this article is completely wrong, ATI had a huge earnings growth the last quarter? Even the comments on the article point this out.

If it cannot scale as it was originally designed, then it's a broken design by definition. I'm sure someone will *something* to tack onto the design to fix it, but for now it's most definitely headed for disaster when the block chain gets too big.
It has absolutely nothing to do with the system being open or closed. Clearly, we need a solution which doesn't depend on the entire network knowing about every transaction that takes place.

You're not missing out on anything, it's not funny at all. It's from an incredibly stupid show on adult swim.
