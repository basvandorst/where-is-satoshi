I'm going to step forward and apologise here. I'm going to apologise on behalf of support, we're working hard on optimising our flow and we receive many, many requests per day. Most of which are dealt with by the Support Agents on the spot, some of which must be passed through the higher-ups. Your case was one that needed to be passed on as it involved the moving of funds.
I'm going to apologise for the delay here, and review your tickets to see how similar issues could be handled better in future. Sorry about this.

Somebody is a little bitter. Doge offers less grumpinessness and more fun! MICRO^MICRO transactions where its ok to send whole numbers and make people smile. I don't actually see Bitcoin being used to tip people in joy, to buy art or tea or fun things, only srs bsns. That is what Doge offers.
Here, try some;
+10 doge verify

Excuse me for making a typo and accidentally putting two 'ness' on the end of grumpy.
I'll be honest, it seems like you're being hostile because you don't get it, are jealous of the tipping culture or are genuinely afraid that it will devalue your precious Bitcoin and overtake what you've been working towards in regards to transactions and everyday use.
Bitcoin of course paved the way for all this, so we can't dismiss it, but over in 'joke-land' we are all aware that bitcoins fractions and tiny numbers just aren't *satisfying* to receive, deep down in the backs of our brains it's much nicer to receive 10 than it is 0.00000000001. 
You don't HAVE to take everything in life so seriously! Bitcoin is still the top dog. (Look, that's not a pun.) Theres no argument about that. We value our coins in satoshis, we do need Bitcoin. There's just room beside you guys for an everyday whole numbers cheerful friendly (yes, silly!) currency. As they say: Bitcoin is diamonds, Doge is dollars.

You clearly have no time for anything other than yourself.  I shall end this conversation here before you become rude.
