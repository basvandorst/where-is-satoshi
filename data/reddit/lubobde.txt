I can't imagine anyone seeing this and starting to think about the blockchain.
If I came across this as a tourist my personal thoughts would be something like this  "Strange thing, may be they put it up here because this was the place of the first Swiss chain factory."

Great idea. And as soon as it reaches 50k we all sell it at the same time and then start it all over again.&lt;/i&gt;

I never get these postings. Why should someone use BTC if he/she will have additional fees which are even not really fixed. I had transactions getting stucked for ever because the market went crazy just that day. Yeah, I sometimes pay my drinks in btc but that's just for the fun. We still have a long way to go.

Ah true, I forgot. High net worth individuals who do not hold bitcoins also don't have any jewels, no vault holding some gold bars or paper based securities from some OTC deals , no piece if art in their livingroom and no Rolex in their wardrobe. Ahhh, no. Truth is, real life is different frim B movies.
What is really going to happen:
If he get's access to his 100 btc he will probably sell most of them, buy a modest house, enjoy some nice holidays, diversify his assets a little bit and the remaining btc will be on a hardware wallet which he can leave on his desk in the open as it is of no value for anyone who does not know the password. And yes, then he will be exactly in the same position as the other families with assets &gt; 1 mUSD.
I don't know where you live but I haven't heard of many BTC killers, not even of big hacks on private(!) wallets. 
On reddit it seems 99% of btc get lost due to forgotten passwords. That is the statistical relevant risk, not some bad guys out of your italo western fantasy.
So instead of deleting his accounts, buying weapons and living in a bunker  all he needs to do is implementing a better backup for his btc. This will already eliminate most of the real risks. After that he can simply go on with his life. He will still have to go to work anyway...

Google for "raspberry bitcoin ticker". It's not ready to use but a very simple DIY project, just enough for one evening of fun.

I fully agree with your starting point. That kind of bitcoin "art" you mention is desgin at best (usually worse).
However, I doubt your current concept conveys your point of view as intended. 
But if it was easy it wouldn't require an artist ;)

1. They do not provide any information about how they gathered the data underlying this report such as applied method, number of responses, wording of the questions asked etc.. So there is no way to evaluate their findings.
2. The report would be much more interesting if there was also data on actual Bitcoin investors not just investors INTERESTED in BTC.
So IMHO a nice try but not more.

If one day a staff member manages to get access to the private keys during production and one day all bitcoins in all customer card vanish - will this company take responsibility and refund the customers?
I think I know the answer ...

Great sources, thx. However, the guys in the comment sections only discuss which Bitcoin payment gateway is best. They are not providing experiences on wether a Bitcoin-only option works for them or not.

"&gt;I heard that customers were not assigned their own individual bank account number until very recently. What bank doesnt give a customer a unique number??
Maybe you should grow up and stop believing everything you hear. Your 2nd sentence already conveys some clues into the right direction.  
Full disclosure : I am running my business via Fidor. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:56:56
You are right, Fidor UK is a quite different animal as compared to Fidor Germany. It seems  they had a similar product over here some years ago, FidorPay, which could be used for some kind of financial activities but did not live up to a normal bank account - until you went through the usual verification process required for opening a bank acccount. 
So the bottom line still is: If you open a bank account at Fidor Germany, you'll get a bank account. If you register for something else you'll get something else.
I opened my Fidor account for dealing with Kraken and that works just perfectly. Only  a year later  I begann using it for business and I have no reasons to complain yet.

The rules where changed when the refugee crisis was at it's height and hundreds of thousands of people stranded here without access to even the most basic financial services not being able to receive or send any payments.
Now by law every bank (at  least in Germany, don't know about other countries) is obliged to provide a basic account to every person who has a residence permit for any country of the European Union. 
So as an American living outside the EU:  no. As an American with a permanent residence in the EU: yes.

"target on the back"? You might adjust your richnesmeeter. 
10% of all families in the US own 1 mUSD or more. That's about 25m people...

Nice video, straight to the point, well presented. 
You might think about adding an intro to your videos. Jingle, title, zhat kind of stuff.

Store your seeds etc in a pgp file and put it on dropbox, google drive etc. (but something with backup/roll back in time function - just in case you delete it by accident!).
Now you can keep your password in the open as nobody knows what it is for. Punch it onto a dog tag, pin a copy to your fridge what ever (have at least two backups inside and outside your home). 
My password is 20 char long, laser engraved on metal "business cards".

I am a Fidor client from Germany, so I might chip in some information:
1. Yes, they are a registered, fully compliant bank. They are part of the German banking system, monitored by the German Bank Authority (Bundesamt für Finanzen, BaFin).
2. They are member of the German bank insurance fund (Einlagensicherungsfond). This means that if they go bust, you are automatically insured for up to 100.000 € and will get back every Cent.
3. They are connected with bitcoin.de and even better with bitcoin exchange Kraken.com. The big thing here is the API. You can directly link your Kraken and Fidor accounts with a few clicks. While normaly funding or retrieving funds to/from your bitcoin exchange account takes 1 to 3 work days, the transfer between Kraken and Fidor takes only about 10 minutes. Even on Sunday night or Christmas eve...

Seems you are in a great mood :))))
Thx for sharing your creative flow of thoughts :)

It makes sense, FB could completely change it's business model with this move.
If they are really going to roll it out it will also have a very positive impact on btc by raising awareness for crypto in general.

Guess who is going to generate the pgp files and hold the passphrase?
Hint: It's not us.
@_date: 2019-05-26 14:49:49
I agree. Being your own bank comes with quite some hazle. Backup of seed words, non-user friendly wallets, addresses which are not human readable...
My guess is btc will become a mrans of value storage but is at least for the moment not ready for mass adoption.
@_date: 2019-05-24 13:22:05
That's an interesting one !
