The .doc file that they sent you has macros, I dont know if that can affect to a OSx system, but my develop environment has detected a possible trojan (HEUR.VBA.Trojan.e ) and my office version has prevent the execution. Also, the hash of that document was analyzed a week ago in VirustTotal, you should noticed that. Every file that you download, if you can, scan it with virustotal, the reason? they sent the signs to the AV then they add it to your next database update. 
Good luck.

I wish to see, if you have a proof or document of how the on screen key board send the clicked keys to a keylogger... I tell you, i use a private trojan and that still its not possible, the only way at this point and how we have tested and  developed this function its having the screen resolution and assuming that the user leave the on screenkeyboard in the default position, and we get the coordenates. Its no easy and isnt near to be eficient if you think the possible variables of this. So the on screenkeyboards after years still are secure, for now.
And about the VM if you look in the setup you can encrypt the virtual hdd, set a connection tunnel, there is many ways to do a strong setup the only way to get in your machine is for your fault, a sw executed in your VM can easily copied and executed in your host machine. 
Great for you and for not lose the BTC

The limit is That they will hold your BTC for 24 -48h because you are new and this is your first trade in there, if you go to the page they have a table with the limits for deposits. I recommend you localbitcoins, is more easy

For setup authy for first time,you need a code right? They ask for a phone number to send a sms or call
How do you get authy if you dont have a cellphone? They dont request a code in the chrome app/extension?

i dont use multibit but should be easy if you know your private keys, so go to blockchain and export them
