I bought some gas yesterday in a southern US state. The pre-authorization was for $125 on a $10 gas purchase.

Wired and their shitty click bait titles. It's just a super hyped title to get people to click so they can get more ad revenue.

Step one, think of question.
Step two, make a statement.
Step three, realize you made a statement but decided to say "fuck it" and put a question mark on it anyway.
Lesson learned. Question marks do not make questions.

Congratulations on your new account to post this single stupid comment. This guys run a business that accepts several forms of crypto currency. Use your crypto to make a change instead of your less than one day old account. Don't criticize the guy for selling his product just because of the form of payment he accepts. something something pot &amp; the kettle.

I think this would go much better in as it's not about Bitcoin.

Welcome to where you can get all of the latest news about Paycoin/Paybase!
    But it's relevant because this guy once upon sold some BTC mining equipment...mmmmkaaayy

I'm sick of the paycoin spam from this subreddit clogging my front page. I rely upon this subreddit to give me info about Bitcoin. What I'm getting instead is a bunch of opinions upon some other coin. Why even bother to draw more attention to them?
I understand the quote but at this point it seems like we're beating a dead horse.

Hmmm, I am trying it right now and I seem to get the same if not better numbers with phoenix 1.5 and a modified phatk.
Any additional settings your putting in? I'm at 1016Mhz, 1k of the ram, but can drop it ofcourse.
Sorry, didn't see that you were at 1080Mhz...lol

You guys really need to work out your shipping for multiple items.
Shipping for 1oz coin = 4.6421 BTC....ok
Shipping for 10*1oz coins = 46.2430 BTC....Not Ok

Seeing that you guys are a Wyoming based business, why not just ship via flat rate USPS? The boxes are free, the shipping cost is extemely predictable due to being flat rate. A small USPS Priority Mail box can hold tens of ounces and only costs $5.00 USD to ship if printed online, 0.20 more if paid at post office. Delivery confirmation is free if done online, 0.70 if done at post office.
All that with a 2-3 day delivery time. And insurance can be added up to $5,000.

I believe if US based you can setup a circle account and get BTC within minutes with a debt card/credit card.

Congratulations. I'm sure there are several out there that still cannot remember their password. If you decide to do some cashing out I'd keep at least half in BTC. If you have any debt it may be a great time to knock it out!

It still is money, just in a different currency. And from what it sounds like... you can still withdraw it, just not into a US account directly.

So if someone gets a SC in at 50GH (originally a 60GH order) and receive 2 JP's to make up for the 10GH does that mean they have the opportunity to upgrade each JP from 4.5 to 7?

The main thing I do not see there is desiccant. Laminating works well but subjected to high humidity and water may separate the seal over time. Your safe may have a rubber gasket but those cheap safes do not do a good job of keeping moisture out over long periods.
