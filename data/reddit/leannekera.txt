Little known fact: Sony has been doing this for years. They actually created the first iPod like mp3 device, but where keeping it from the market as their CD players etc... where still in demand.
Then Apple came along and threw a spanner into the works.

Can’t help but feel like Coinbase are doing a Russia and hiring staff to post positive comments on here... I mean seriously, Bitcoin Cash and the recent Visa issues shouldn’t be this overlooked by the community.
Will be interesting to see how many people they have to downvote me... 3, 2, 1, GO!

An unsecured email server. Which as a security risk was a huge problem for a lot of people when it involves Clinton. 
Significantly less of a security concern was Trump discussing the removal of Comey in the Oval Office with the Russian Ambassador...
Or Trump discussing a crisis in North Korea with the Prime Minister of Japan over (“The Best”) chocolate cake at Mara Lago, within earshot of civilians and using a smartphone for light...
Or... oh I don’t know... the Russian Dossier which while it hasn’t been fully proven, significant portions have been. And more importantly, not one single element of it has been disproven. 
So yeah, I guess lots of systems can be misused by criminals. It just appears that only Democrats get criticised for it. 
Perhaps we should be as cautious as KellyAnne Conway... even microwaves can be bugged!

You edited your comment after I posted. Who do you think you are? Trump?

The U.K. does it too. I’m not blinded to the issue and you shouldn’t just dismiss the Russia probe either.
Collusion isn’t actually unlawful. This is a word that’s been misguidedly thrown around by the media to better help the public understand the issue.
Conspiring however is unlawful and amounts to Treason. 
This word can be found in all references and indictments regarding Russians and Trumps campaign members.
Does this help you to realise that there is a lot more to the allegations?
I’m from the U.K. so have our own problems, but we can’t ignore the fact that the whole thing stinks and Trump supporters just seem to be holding their nose. It will eventually effect everyone.

Because pointing the finger at previous instances isn’t going to help stop the here and now.
What it will do however is divert attention-away from the current corruption and the cycle will continue. 
Do you really want to use the excuse that it’s ok for one because another got away with it? Or do you want this to stop?

Yeah... so good luck getting your rights when someone screws you over.
