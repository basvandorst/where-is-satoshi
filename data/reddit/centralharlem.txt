You are mistaken. They could have been quietly accumulating bitcoin during the three week period when prices were stable, July 7-23. Then this week the good news comes out they all sell at once, driving prices down 9.6% in five days. If they've been working on the announcements a bit longer, their buying could have been responsible for the runup between June 25 and July 1. No way to know, but you certainly don't need to look back three months.

or a debit card

It's not the merchant doing the conversion, it's an intermediary. The business never knows that bitcoin was ever involved. By the reasoning used in marking all the Kansas City restaurants bitcoin-friendly, every business in America should be so marked, as well as all government entities and charities, since third parties can convert your bitcoins into cash that these organizations are happy to accept.

The next time I need to buy something from Latvia for $0.18, I will be sure to use bitcoin. Until then, I'm not sure it's so "huge".

You are mistaken. The CostCo on East 116th Street in New York City takes Amex, debit, or cash. No credit cards.
@_date: 2014-07-17 20:26:21
About that, you are almost surely mistaken. People get busted for unregistered sale of securities all the time, and they'll get busted for this too if they don't follow the rules.

It would not be illegal to create one, only to share it before it has been registered. This is analogous to securities regulation, and exists to make it harder for criminals to rip off less sophisticated individuals.

The "cyber-attack" described in the article was nothing more than well-executed 1985-style social engineering on a firm with inadequate security protocols. Kudos to the journalist for describing it so clearly.

"Free placement?" You know that businesses with ATMs are generally paid rent to host then? Find out the going rate in the neighborhood, offer to match it, and you will find it easier to place a new Bitcoin machine.

What makes you think it is going to be hitting the NYSE ever? Certainly the Winkevii would be foolish to have organized a pump when they have no legal way of taking advantage of it (except by selling their personal stash, that is).
Does anybody know their cost basis, by the way?

I believe it did. It's stupid enough to be believable. Had the original poster said something coherent, *that* would have been hard to credit.
@_date: 2014-08-05 02:09:20
The OP got a great deal -- in the case where he wasn't defrauded, he got the good infinitesimally cheaper because the merchant didn't have to pay credit card fees. Having almost half his money stolen without recourse is a small price to pay.
@_date: 2014-06-12 17:11:31
From what I see, Amex introduced a credit card, called the "Optima" card in 1987. The normal Amex card is not, and has never been a credit card. I have no idea what fraction of Amex's total business the Optima card accounts for.

If you have precisely the power that your enemy thinks you have, I've got bad news for you. Regulators, like the general public, think you're a crowd of hapless neckbeards.

The problem may be that some of the people who pointed out the problem came from the bitcoin-skeptical community (as, with full disclosure, do I). People here may be apt to disregard the message because they don't like the messenger.

There is no inheritance tax in the United States for estates under $5.3 million (if never married), or $10.6 million (if widowed), and there's no limit at all if you die first and leave everything to your spouse. In other words, these little old men and little old ladies are almost certainly not engaged in tax avoidance; it is exceedingly unlikely that their estate will owe any taxes anyway.

A modest correction -- at 28 coins, you have *$12,500* tied up in this shit. See, your problem is getting smaller every day.
@_date: 2014-06-12 17:44:15
You are correct. Interesting. I checked their annual report and they claim to have "over 1200" different card products globally. They report that 58% of their U.S. business is from the traditional "charge" cards, the rest from credit cards. The global stats may be buried in the report somewhere but I'm not seeing them at the moment.
@_date: 2014-10-26 11:42:14
Cancelled? When? I know it hasn't yet been approved but I had not read anywhere that they had stopped trying.

It may be legal to engage in market manipulation and insider trading with Bitcoin. There's no case law, though, so you're taking risk. And this applies only to the coinz themselves; if the WinkleETF ever lists, it will be subject to all relevant securities laws.
@_date: 2014-09-05 13:02:42
Doesn't this reply admit that the current system works? And if it works, why would one be "retarded/stupid/ignorant/lazy/scared' to continue using it?
@_date: 2014-07-21 17:28:20
Lawsky's job is to prevent people from using Bitcoins to rip off widows and orphans. And don't try to pretend it would never happen. I am sure he's delighted to develop a reputation as a financial regulator a step ahead of the curve on this matter; when he inevitably runs for governor, he will brag "I regulated virtual currencies."
@_date: 2014-09-02 22:06:44
Right, that's why no currency from a country with a central bank has ever collapsed. Stay by the phone, the Nobel people may call at any moment.
@_date: 2014-07-30 22:20:52
Trivial explanation -- people who had advance knowledge of the good news bought bitcoin days or weeks ago, planning to capitalize on the public reaction to their announcement. Now that the news is out, they no longer have any reason to hold, so they sell and the price drops. With securities, this would be insider trading but with bitcoin, it may not even be illegal.
@_date: 2014-12-01 13:30:36
Ah, I misunderstood. You are hoping somebody else will buy a bitcoin ATM and set it up in your lobby so that the fees paid by you and your co-workers (and perhaps some tourists) will pay them back for the cost of the machine plus a reasonable profit margin.
If the location is good enough to support that, why not just buy the machine yourself?
@_date: 2015-05-27 13:26:11
Agreed. This situation is totally the OP's fault.
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:50:11
Yes, a decline in the value of speculative assets will clearly be good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 15:40:50
Not true. Market prices have slippage; buying above the market price but below the anticipated slippage is rational.

They started buying under $30. They've never announced where they stopped buying or what their average price is. They might easily be under water today.

The judge actually speculates in writing about why the defense has done such a lousy job, concluding it has been "tactical" and perhaps intended to make it easier to get an appeal after Ulbricht is convicted.
