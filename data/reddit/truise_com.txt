There are ATMs every few blocks.  Fees are high though.   PM me if you absolutely need to sell it.

Free checking accounts are common but I have never had one that didn't cost 40 books to get a checkbook with it.
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:39:08
I can't ...I need 0.01 min to withdrawal.     I have 0.009.   I don't remember bit coin being this user friendly a years back    I do want to give you your btc back but I don't know how.    If you sent me a little more I'll send you all I got. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 07:55:39
Check normal ATMs.  They have Bitcoin services.   
Yeah there will be a limit.  And good luck doing OTC for 1 Bitcoin without a trusted relationship.

I can't figure out how to pm on this app.   19EnKtLimtnwnnMcRMrDnLSfV4UN62wdx7.    I will send it right back once I'm able to rescue my funds.
@_date: 2014-01-28 07:32:16
I got it thank you.  What is your address so I can send it back.
@_date: 2014-07-26 03:24:24
I agree.   I don't think Russia would do something like this without having ulterior motives.

You may be right but I recall seeing a screenshot of someone saying basically the same exact thing on the exact day of the last major crash.  
@_date: 2019-03-01 02:46:40
I think Beam is the better investment decision and will get more adoption.  
@_date: 2019-03-16 04:10:10
Name a chain as secure as Bitcoin.  I'll wait.  Snowblossom maybe but that is a huge migration waiting to happen. 
@_date: 2019-03-30 22:58:17
Imagine believing high level bankers are nerds ((like us)).
They are nothing jobs that they are born into basically.  Perspective, the leader of Microsoft's global blockchain division is now starting a region specific ICO with Ian Balina as a marketer.  Those at the top know nothing about this technology. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 16:41:21
It's not an issue.  At all. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 16:12:00
So we don't have to type Sats out
@_date: 2019-03-13 06:17:31
There is a good Bitmex research article on this.  I can't link to it now, if it hasn't been posted it should be. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 12:57:54
Coinbase "wallet" lol
@_date: 2019-02-23 06:42:26
Miners won't go for that chain.  Heaviest chain wins.  
@_date: 2019-02-24 05:17:14
That's what the chain shows.  Majority of liquid Bitcoin appears to be the same 150k~
@_date: 2019-02-07 00:44:14
If BlueWallet completely goes down is there any method of recovery like keys or a seed?
@_date: 2019-02-14 01:46:55
1 sat pls
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:42:37
More will fall out of circulation permanently.  It happens everyday.
@_date: 2019-02-27 17:30:55
Why would he use a used address?
@_date: 2019-02-27 17:26:25
That is not the case.  The main improvement with MW is scaling and maybe privacy.  The TPS is relatively low but a slight improvement on Bitcoin.  LN's use case is ultra cheap, 'instant', and spammable txs.  This can't be done on MW based chains.  
@_date: 2019-02-05 02:45:39
Where can I read more discourse about this topic?
@_date: 2019-02-27 17:29:31
Assume after 100 years the amount of inflation is less than the amount loss visa death and simply losing keys.  This is true for most blockchains except for centralized stuff like EOS where they can just take your coins.  
@_date: 2019-02-14 04:59:52
It costs real Bitcoin. Not saying Bitcoin isn't real money but state actors can just print more money, they can't print more Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:41:08
But they be no reason to not include transactions especially within a few decades when the fees will be more than the block reward.
@_date: 2019-04-28 07:42:37
Red listing techniques will be why DEXs will flourish in the future.
@_date: 2019-04-14 09:19:38
This guy just needs to be redirected to Coinbase or Bittrex or something with a fiat gateway.    Lol at the people recommending Tails and Electrum.  This obviously isn't a power user folks.
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:52:57
You did good by alerting immediately.  Can never be too sure. What if no one had responded to a scam yet and a noob got trapped.  
@_date: 2019-01-10 18:03:19
@_date: 2019-01-15 02:17:24
And everyone knows the inflation schedule while with USD there is plenty of events that can happen that only the elite would get tipped off to first.  
@_date: 2018-11-02 02:55:47
Try and open the Json file with notepad ++ my friend.   
@_date: 2018-04-11 02:28:04
Guess you haven't been to Mexico.  Oxxo is huge.  Literally more prevalent than any other store in Mexico. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 04:56:55
Or sats for plural. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:57:31
Where can I find info on the Bitcoin available for sale?
I assumed coin days destroyed but I can barely read that data for this purpose.
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:33:46
Practice safe address management and don't reuse an address then.  Quantum worries gone.
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:16:54
21 trillion + national debt..
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:04:41
You might have it backwards.. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 01:25:38
I'm waiting to see if this is legitimate before I make a large purchase as well.
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:53:20
The theoretical majority '' atheists '' all believing in no god.  Does not make no god reality.    You gotta really look at it from a different point of view to see what I'm saying.. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:08:53
 So there is a growing share of people who do not believe in a higher power and that makes it reality?     Yeah I don't think so.. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:23:05
Exactly...    Point is moot
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:03:30
