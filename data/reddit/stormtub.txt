What about programming opportunities? It's very easy to create software that directly interacts with the BTC network. Besides gambling (Satoshi Dice) I'm unable to come up with some good use of this, but certainly there must arise some really cool use cases here..?!

So you tell us that there is no security breach or malware involved (and no one other than your parents at your residence that could have sniffed your connection). You dismiss any suggestions that you might be wrong somewhere as highly unlikely and yet your title is "Got hacked."
This leaves me wondering: what exactly do you suspect got hacked?

It is possible to manually inspect the code being run in your web browser and therefore verify its integrity. There are different programming languages used to make websites and some programming languages runs (is processed) server side and some client side (aka on your computer). Bitaddress.org is programmed in JavaScript, a client side language, and therefore all the processing done to display the website is available for inspection to the end user.
However, it's impractical to manually verify the code each time you load the web page (there's several thousands lines of code!) and nearly impossible for a newbie. The server administrator is able to change the code whenever he wishes. So if you are to use this service, you will still need to trust the owner to not deceive you. The open source JavaScript part of it make it seems more trustworthy, but I would definitely not trust it with a lot of money. Alternatively, you could inspect the code once and then download it to your computer or host it yourself for future use.

Interesting. How do you know that?
