Do you do maths? $100k/10k bitcoin = 10x

Can you share where you were buying from? I’d like to pick up some vitamins using BTC instead of fiat.

Still loading OMG. Remind me when plasma is out.

They capped their ICO. No idea what you're talking about. They're the furthest ahead in terms of Plasma, and lightning is nowhere near capable of what plasma is.

This bullrun is projected to hit $100k before a retrace. $1mil is within 5-10 years.

Well, you’re wrong.
@_date: 2019-12-11 06:37:54
Because that investment is the only 10 I see ;)

Infrastructure is necessary to grow the crypto sphere. If you think bitcoin is the end all be all, your loss.

UnLocal* Bitcoins is their new name, please use accordingly.

Rookie mistake

Having been in the BTC game since 2013, and no I’m no self-proclaimed expert nor guru, but I will bet on it that we retrace tonight and hit 9000 next weekend. Two cents, take it for what you will.
