At the moment it's clearing at approx 3 MB per hour, with about 145 MB still to go. This is pretty fast, probably because it's Sunday night and demand for new transactions is low.
Normally backlog clearance rates are around 30-40 MB per 24 hours. So as a crude estimate, I'd expect 3-5 days for the current backlog.

I had my coins trapped in segwit earlier today.
Oh. Wait. That was bitcoin gold. There is only one meaningful mining pool, and it didn't support segwit transactions, so segwit transactions would never be mined.

It's clearly not an antminer.
This picture shows 14 wire connections from controller to ASIC boards. The Antminer S9 uses 18 wire connections. 
Additionally, the power connectors are on the opposite side on this device, compared to the antminer. The controller board is also obviously different.

Only the sender has to support segwit. 
If you send from a segwit address, then the transaction will go as a segwit transaction, regardless of the receiving address.
If you send from an old style address, then the transaction will go as an old style transaction, regardless of the receiving address.
In all cases, the transaction will work (segwit-to-legacy, legacy-to-segwit, legacy-to-legacy and segwit-to-segwit), but you only get the benefit of increased block capacity/lower fees if sending from segwit.

The signature is needed to prove integrity of the blockchain.
Segwit allows the signature to be deleted (to save block space) when sending to a legacy version of the bitcoin software which only supports 1MB blocks. The transactions will go through, and will be validated by the network as a whole, but the operator of a legacy node cannot perform full validation of the blockchain themselves.
Segwit capable clients support large blocks, so can keep the signatures in place, allowing them to operate in a fully validating mode. 
Pre-segwit rules are that segwit transactions don't need signatures, so legacy clients accept them, even with the signatures deleted. Segwit capable clients only accept segwit transactions, if they have a valid signature.

The only practical way to do this is to create a new address for each purchase order.
The transaction does not  usually contain any information; just the sending address which is pseudonymous. Technically, it is possible to include a transaction reference, but most wallet software does not support it and it would take up blockchain space. So why not use the destination address as the reference.
Bitcoin addresses are intended to be single use disposable tools. Once payment has been made from an address its security is (very, very slightly) compromised. Hence best practice is to receive transactions to an address, make one outgoing transaction only from that address, and then abandon the address. So Alice had 5btc in her Alice1 address, and wanted to send 1btc to Bob, she would make 1 transaction sending 1btc to Bob, and 4btc to a newly created Alice2 address.

I'm struggling to understand the motivation here.
F2Pool have been campaigning for big blocks, and are now withdrawing their support. Fair enough.
However, F2Pool are nevertheless a significant contributor to blockchain congestion because they are not taking advantage of segwit. They one of several mining pools who insist on mining 1 MB blocks, and do not use the new segwit weight rules. As a result, the blocks they mine are averaging around 90% full, whereas other pools are averaging over 99%.
I could understand this malicious behaviour in the context of campaigning for big blocks, but it doesn't make sense after withdrawing NYA support.

Some miners have their software misconfigured to only generate 1 MB blocks, even if segwit is enabled. (BTC.TOP is an example of this).
On average, there is approximately 70 kB of segwit data per block at present. So, in the last 24 hours, that works out as approx 10 MB of extra transactions. In other words, the current backlog of approx 30 MB, would be about 40 MB in the absence of segwit.

Technically, there is a second attack route, but it is not in any way meaningful. 
In a standard p2pkh transaction, the redeemer must provide the pubkey solving address=hash(pubkey)AND a valid signature for the transaction signed by the same pubkey. The pubkey is revealed, during redemption and thereafter the security requirement degrades to that of the signature. 
In a p2wsh  transaction, the requirement is to solve address=hash(script). The normal way to redeem a p2wsh tx is to use a script which requires a pubkey and signature. This way, revealing the script does not destroy the security. 
The difference is that p2pkh *always* requires a signature. Whereas p2wsh can be redeemed by hash collision. 
In reality, this is moot, as the strength of the hash against collision/pre-image is overwhelmingly greater than the resistance of the signature.

Segwit is a soft fork because it tightens rules about transactions : certain types of "anyone can spend" transactions have been made into securely signed transaction.
A miner or node attempting to use the old looser rules would create a new fork with just themselves and old clients on it. Now that segwit has locked in on most nodes, loosening the rules would result in a hard fork. Hard forks require overwhelming consensus, 51% won't cut it.

Don't forget miners. There are still miners holding out and mining segwit blocks, but limiting block size, so as to not make the additional capacity available. 
It sounds like some want high fees and small blocks; which is odd as many of them are signalling NYA.

Several miners are already mining incompletely full blocks, even for the last 24 hours when mempool has been bursting at the seams. For example, F2pool, BTCTOP, GB miners.
Examining their mining history, these mining pools have been consistently and reliably producing undersized blocks.
