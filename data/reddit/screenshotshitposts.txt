Q for you guys. Do you trade the GBP/BTC pair? Ive found the prices are almost always better on EUR/BTC when looking at the exchange rate and the volume is much higher too. Also you cant withdraw GBP on GDAX anyway.

lets be honest your parents gave you 1k in small increments and told you not to spend it. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:21:40
come on man get what Im trying to say. OP is a fraud copying the 'homeless with a sign' format weve seen so many times here before.
And anyway if you were into making money at age 8 youll have to at least provide some perspective for us. Were your parents good investers? Did they install good values on you? Did your 8yo peers have the same mentality?
But honestly though dude thats impressive. Much respect and keep it up.

Im really just trying to find out if people find the GBP/BTC pair on GDAX at all useful. Theres near nothing you can do with GBP in a GDAX account. I *really* wish GDAX would let me trade on the USD pair because the volume is 20x as large.
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:33:38
yeah pretty much. you are kinda selling your coins for a lambo.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:47:32
$50 even 20x is only $1000. The guy literally said if he invested $1 in July hed have 10s of thousands. I think a reality check is a good idea. Lets not forget that 20x the current market cap is about $2 trillion

yeah but again. at twelve youre in secondary education, thinking about job prospects. At 8 youre making sand castles and rolling in mud. its not unreasonable that an 8yo would think about this, but with all due respect that kids probably a bit autistic or the 0.1% if the parents arent involved at all (and I seriously mean autistic in the completely medical meaning as in on the spectrum not the way they use it on t_d or 4chan)
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:52:18
there is a 3% conversion fee youre forgetting about though. 
edit: as far as I can tell theres a lot of other fees as well when actually using the card. Not in US so cant talk from experience. Can anyone explain what this means in non-banker terms? ~~Does that mean $1000 loaded is essentially $800 usable?~~ it doesnt. fees are about 3% on use

they are different services. its not on purpose. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:18:02
speculation kinda, but really its mostly to do with the amount of buys and sells. A lot of people with bitcoin are on this sub, do they look like they want to sell to you?
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:58:50
Bits is pretty stupid. But selling a coffee for 0.00000001 coins is stupid and a waste of time. There will be an accepted denomination for time's sake and most likely it will be a division of 10.

transaction fees. buying/selling fees is just exchanges basically stealing from you. I mean theyre not stealing from you, but when you pay 4% on a purchase and then another $6 withdrawing $100 from an exchange you kind of are getting mugged. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:53:37
oh theyre definitely shit. good tip: mark your ticket as something that makes it look like they'll lose money. I always mark them as purchase or deposit issues and just act stupid. I'm convinced they have multiple support queues.

@_date: 2017-11-28 06:53:06
Just look at their post history. Most of them prove themselves pretty stupid or shill-ish within the first page I find. 
Overall, the issue with bcash is that if they just want to increase the blocksize; as soon as the userbase increases theyre going to need to increase the blocksize again and again until it is just not feasible for nodes to download and verify. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:43:56
doesnt mean much though. about half the coins in circulation are unrecoverable. thats about 50~70billion right there to take off the market cap.

there are markets where you can do stop loss orders. you could just buy in and create stop loss in case it does drop when youre not watching. I wouldnt do it personally because Im always at my computer, but holding out for a drop a week after a drop is kind of silly of you. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:05:54
if you want something free that you can store offline, Electrum is great. Paper wallets are also nice for complete security. Electrum is safe, but you are still running though their servers so they do know your balance etc. 
Also, bi-monthly may be the way to go for you, but think how annoyed you would be if the price spiked. Or if it dropped but you had already bought last month. It comes with the territory of course, but its something to think about. 
Also, if you do keep money on an exchange, it may be quite useful if you want to sell quick or if you decide to move to a different currency for whatever reason (there aren't many reasons).
Good luck hodling and getting in control of your finances friend!
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:00:19
it works though unfortunately. Just today I had to sit my friend down (we're both 2nd year computer sci) and explain why BCH doesnt have a legit scaling solution. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:13:11

@_date: 2017-11-12 22:20:48
yeah. and then when real buyers jump in they lift the wall, the buyers steam through real but small sell orders and the price jumps. the price walls are artificial and probably controlled by a program that operates much faster than any human could.

@_date: 2017-11-19 21:05:16
I dont actually use them myself I just do limit orders. But I believe Kraken has stop loss orders in the Advanced Orders page. Honestly though, I would put a lot of effort into avoiding Kraken. There are other better markets.
You should probably avoid stop losses in crypto though. Sometimes the price dips for a second and the people with stop losses are the ones that get f*d. Thats most likely what happened the day Ether dropped from $200 to $20 for a few minutes. A few people with stop losses sold at $20 and woke up to $200 buy orders as normal. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:41:00

make a transaction. itll become much clearer. get a wallet that allows you to "backup your keys" to somewhere safe and offline like a usb. Electrum allows you to do this, but youre still relaying via a node on their servers. If you want to be in full control of your money; run your own node, use a wallet that connects only to your node (bitcoin core is the software to run a node and it has a wallet built in that only connects to your node). if you want to run a node though you have to store the blockchain and upload a lot of data but if you can do that it means your in full control of your wallet. You have better control over fees you pay (if youre moving coins that are stored on bittrex for example; instead of paying a transaction fee you just pay them 0.001 btc, even if your sending money to a wallet that is also on bittrex).
I dont think theres much benefit to running a node right now if Im honest. I see it becoming more popular in the future though for businesses that make a lot of transactions. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:45:23
you could make an electrum wallet on a usb without a password on it or a temp one and send it to there. give them the usb. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:16:39
I can see it going much higher. If every house in the world was tokenized and purchasable with bitcoin, theres a lot more than 21 million houses in the world. Or it could stop being used. 
I dont think it will to be honest. I think we won't see a spike like that again unless we have *huge* userbase gains. I don't see that happening until more stores start accepting it. Even then, theres a lot of peopel who still won't care until theres a really obvious benefit to them, like a store offering a 20% discount to bitcoin customers.

This is also true. I know a few people who will ring me up in the middle of the night asking why it dropped 2%. Then there are some who have grasped the idea of hodling, have seen returns already and are perfectly happy just checking their balance once a month. It tends to be the people with very little invested that get really jumpy about small swings. And they know I will ring them if there is genuinely anything to worry about.

@_date: 2017-11-20 02:49:29
it is risky. they technically control your money and could theoretically stop you from withdrawing it temporarily. Or permanently. Honestly, they probably won't but you will pay about $3 to withdraw from coinbase each time, so with small investments of $10 a week just send it there and withdraw once every month or two. Youre also going to pay around $2 in fees for each buy too (it'll go up if you buy more, but itll be cheaper respectively). So you'd definitely benefit from doing $40 a month, or just doing more at a time.

Hi. I'm pretty sure its okay to post links here. Someone let me know if its not.
I used OPSkins.com. They take 10% from the sale and when you have over $5 in your account you can withdraw via BitPay.
I'm still waiting for the rest of my skins to sell though so I haven't actually withdrawn anything yet. Just FYI because Ive never used BitPay before and I'm not sure how many coins I'll see in the end, but all the reviews look good. There are other sites that let you do this but I think they take a higher cut and have less users so sales probably take longer. Enjoy mate.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:31:12
pretty lucky then that he had exactly the right amount. Definitely not worth waiting a month. As soon as you are a dollar over your debt amount, sell. Thats always been my motto.

bitcoin has a temporary issue with transaction fees. they are very high and in order to get your transaction processed in the next block, you need to be in the highest of fees. bitcoin has updates coming to fix this issue, but some dumbasses decided that it would be a good scam if they copy pasted the bitcoin code and doubled the block size, meaning more transactions can be processed at once. Problem is though that the use of bitcoin cash is very low, meaning that in future they will need to double the blocksize again, and again, and again. Its not a proper fix, but at the moment with transaction fees high and some taking over 24 hours because they are being outbid in fees, its a perfect time to strike bitcoin. Theyve created a false narrative through marketing that bitcoin is dying and being turned into a centralized currency to fix these issues. Its not true, but the majority of people don't understand cryptography or computer science, so the BCH guys have been very successful in their marketing campaign. bitcoin.com / r/btc and the above wallet are all part of the false narrative.

Not sure where you are but the BTC ATMs near me don't have cameras on them. Couple months ago I went and put £3000 in £10 notes into one over about 15 minutes and it was literally in a Turkish 24 hour shop next the the freezer with the weird meat and goat heads.

no you just have to write a support ticket lying saying that you are waiting to deposit fees and they will respond much quicker because you get put in their priority queue. Don't ever make a support ticket in the "withdrawal issues" section.

thanks. i like mine in my core wallet atm because they are secure but also if I do want to trade them I can send them to an exchange quicky and cheaply. Also because it connects to my node only.

news just in. People are spending and transferring money. Could this be the end of money?
The FUD on this page today is hilarious. Sock puppets everywhere.

ok I understand. Thanks for the explanation. Sorry for being misleading @_date: 2017-11-13 14:56:05
and we try to say that people in crypto aren't just making money for nothing

He turned 10 cents into 90 cents. Time to buy an island.

Isn't it Square Space's fourth "cryptocurrency exchange" theme? The one that comes with free hosting for 30 days?

quick someone inform HBO and the NHS that the next ransom will have low transaction fees.

i keep hearing this also, and have started running a full node for about a week now. I still cant work out what people mean by this though? Are you saying I should store my BTC on the core wallet? Because everything Ive read says otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:19:26
no but it makes me happy knowing that you are lying. 
Prove any of what you are saying. Youre a liar and an attention seeker. Wheres that update on the black baby you and your white wife had 3 years ago?
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:48:34
its a meme dumbass. we've all seen you posting here previously. At what price will you give it a rest? I'd like to set a reminder
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:12:52
I honestly don't think that happens. Most of the money is people who read a tiny bit about a new ICO and buy in because its a low price. I know a few people irl who have told me they switched to BCH. The propaganda is aimed at people who buy into ICOs because "this one is to do with selling decentralized cloud storage" etc. Then you ask them why wouldnt storage sellers rather get paid in BTC and you see the ideas in their head start to burst. 
I think the target of the advertising is people on r/cryptocurrency and those that have made profitable trades once or twice out of sheer luck.

we will always need expensive hdmi cables.

i havent heard anything about recovering them. I'd imagine it would be pretty hard to verify coins as lost too without some kind of already built protocol for sending messages to wallet addresses. As for the implications, it really just means that they are a lot rarer than most people think, and the big-scary market cap of $130B isn't nearly as big as either.
edit: I'm being attacked by r/btc trolls atm, so if I was downvoted for being wrong, I would genuinely appreciate an explanation. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:30:38
yeah sure :)

they locked me out and after 4 months of writing support tickets that they just closed here's what they said "youre going to need to make a new account with a different email".
dude, do you think I believe that it will be quick to get you to re-verify my account, give me access to gdax back, and give me back my £50,000 a day limit and £50k trading loan? Yeah, no. Kraken and Bittrex from now on. Kraken verified me to level 3, 3 hours after registering.
edit: also when I saw this image posted as Steam Customer Support my first thought was "nah this is Coinbase" too lol
