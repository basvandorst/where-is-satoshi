Altcoins for the most part are simply experimental coins to me, which is a great way to beta test features and improvements that might make into Bitcoin itself eventually once proven viable. 
Bitcoin has $8 Billion riding on its software and a lot of VC investment too, so changes are not to be taken lightly or deployed without rigorous testing. I imagine this is why Core development is slow. Altcoins however are not so restricted, which makes them excellent testbeds. 
The problem with most coins is they are trying to market themselves as the Next Big Thing or "bitcoin 2.0" or whatever, but have no chance of playing at Bitcoin's level.
The only exceptions are chains that are actually based on a different resource. An example would be if Bitcoin is the new Visa, Storjcoin would be the new Dropbox, Twister would be the new Twitter. Coins that replace existing centralized services like Google, Facebook, etc, are what we really need.

Underdeveloped for sure, but big potential.
I would love to see a Namecoin/CJDNS implementation, as CJDNS still needs a solid domain name system.
.bit is what we have to start, but eventually I would hope one could register nearly anything as a domain as long as its not taken, TLDs included. Ultimately that was the point over having ICANN in total control of this mechanism and what TLDs get in and which ones don't.

It would be nice, but keep in mind supply chains are not all in BTC.

One thing to watch out for is that most ISPs have dynamically set IPs, meaning your front end address will change once in a while. You should see if you can get a static IP so the link says persistent with other nodes. 
Otherwise running a full node is heavier than you might expect. It is recommended to be running a real server in a datacenter. VPS can be had for pretty cheap though the higher storage requirement can make it more expensive.

The point of Bitcoin is that we should not rely on the word of real people alone. No matter what they say, the simple fact is as long as it is a possibility for them to derail the blockchain by getting too big, we cannot trust CEX.IO to keep their word because "we promise".
I think distributed mining pool structure should be built into Bitcoin Core. Really the issue is not CEX.IO itself, this issue is a symptom, but a fundamental flaw in the mining process as it is.

Bitcoin is Mastercard's replacement. Open innovation is the way things are going in technology. 
The concept and nature of patents today is extremely outdated, slow, and unkind to human progression thanks to corporate patent trolling lawyers.
If a company like Mastercard wants to compete, they need to start adding Bitcoin services reminiscent of Coinbase and start moving away from traditional credit card services, which is all a huge credit bubble looking for a time and place to implode all the same.

I also remind myself the US Dollar is not stable or fundementally sound either. 
It's value is fluctuatuating too due to fat inflation thanks to FED money pumping. Dollars have lost most of their buying power since inception in 1913. Prices of basic goods are now rising because inflation is getting out of control.
This is why I don't look at price, as the US Dollar is getting kicked in the teeth internationally. I see massive development and a much needed paradigm shift away from oligarch control. That is the future I am buying into. 
Is a Bitcoin really worth the buying power of ~$600, or should it really be a lot more than that? I think its undervalued myself.

Then I want to be able to load SteamOS onto my DIY console and buy HL3 with Bitcoin.
Or hell, why not Steamcoin? Each console could be a node in their own secure transaction network. Each one would generate a little Steamcoin for the service, kind of an incentive to get free game points to spend. Even game distribution could be handled via blockchain, or at least part of it like Steam authentication. 
Either way Valve is clearly jumping on the open source bandwagon, I don't discount the notion of them getting to cryptocurrency eventually.

I think there will come a time when Bitcoin acts like a wealth siphon from the uber-elite. 
Their system is dieing a slow death as it is totally unsustainable and inherently corrupted by greedy people, but clearly are too jaded to notice how out of control the markets have gotten due to global money stuffing to prop up the credit charade longer. 
As holders and supporters of this early technology  I think we stand to make a fantastic fortune as it eats up the economic rot occurring, steadily increasing demand for BTC. Bitcoin will do for finance and business what BitTorrent did for media. 
In the coming deflationary collapse of the Dollar, I am curious how many traditional investors suddenly jump into Bitcoin when their overvalued stock portfolios start to tank hard after years of artificial FED driven bull run of stocks.

The only reason I don't see mining transaction fees going up is simply volume.
Right now the mining network is insanely large compared to how much work it is actually doing, as really not that many transactions are flying through the network yet to verify. A miners primary income right now are the block rewards.
As adoption increases and  Bitcoin begins moving at pace, miners will be collecting far more tiny fees. Transaction volume will keep fee prices low. Whoever has the lowest may attract more volume perhaps.
Once block rewards are gone someday miners will be 100% sustained by transaction fees. I am curious to see what happens with the next block halving.

Or you can not be a greedy bastard and realize servers and time cost money, give the node ops some due. Miners get rewards for helping the network and no one complains about that. A pool charges a whole 1% fee and people think it is outrageous or say they should join a free pool.
P2Pool nodes are also highly dependent on connection speed. A zero % p2pool might seem better but if it is too far away, your mining will suffer greatly. What fee it is should be last on your list when evaluating nodes to join. 
On the whole P2Pool earns a bit more if not more erratically, any fee costs should be more or less neutralized.

Ghash is a symptom, not the problem. It means that the mining infrastructure does not have enough incentive built in to host decentralized options, like P2Pool. 
Though, P2Pool does have its issues, like there not really being that many reliable nodes around. Is it a proper server? Someone's old desktop on a home connection? You don't really know. It seems like uptimes are generally atrocious. We can't push forward without a stable base of well known, high uptime, and high bandwidth nodes. 
That said, I've launched my own p2pool node in Seattle, not quite ready, but I do believe this is the way to go. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:42:35
The only incentive to destroy the network is just that. There would be no profit in that for anyone involved, in fact they would take a serious loss to do this.
Even if someone did this, there are 500 or more other currency networks out there on other algos. 
It may put a dent in the crypto-economy, but that is the real beauty of this: Bitcoin is not the only currency, it is part of a larger whole. If BTC died, the market would adjust fluidly to fill the void with other currencies. The next major one would just use an algo that would make the attackers mining farms 100% useless.

Though really if you can afford enough gear and power to get a visit from the po-po, you can afford a commercial space to put them in too. 
They get suspicious when one house on a street is using craploads more power on average than the rest. In the past there was almost certainly nothing else using that much power than a grow op in a residential neighborhood, so they assume that is whats going on.

With a proper server it took me about 1 day to download it. 20Gb is also nothing space these days. Even if it grows to a terabyte in 20 years, our storage tech will be far ahead of it and probably way faster. 
Unless you are running a real server via VPS or racked machines, you shouldn't be running a node anyway. 
It requires high availability and the ability to service 100s of connections 24/7, and does consume some bandwidth. Generally you won't get away with this using an old PC and home cable connection. Depends on what you have though. A VPS is around $20 a month that can handle it, so it doesn't take much to help out the network by maintaining a node. 
I think it was Gavin Anderson who said unless you can provide this kind of service to the network, you are hurting more than helping.
And if you are running a node, help out and get P2Pool going on it too :)

The only thing that can be regulated at all are the gateway's between Bitcoin and fiat currency: the exchanges.

I forsee this as well. When the portfolio of all big traders and HFT companies start to really catch on fire, where will they run? What is safe haven when fiat currency fails as it always has historically? Any market tied to fiat will be hammered into the ground with it.
Bitcoin may be the only functioning economy left standing. A run on the banks at the same time as a run on Bitcoin could actually happen I think. 
This technology solves financial problems that have been up to this point unsolvable. The implications of blockchains are astounding, and will most certainly reshape our world and take back control from the oligarch planetary monopoly. We will all get to make a choice eventually: Bitcoin, the open and free economy, or the Oligarchy that has enslaved us with debt and caused untold human misery for 300 years and extreme damage to our planet.

I think it is also worth noting that it will take some time for that $260 Million of VC capital to really sink in and become productive. Right now there are a glob of startups working on a Bitcoin product. It is great news such VC cap has been invested, but we have yet to actually see the result of this yet. 
Give it a year and I think there will be an explosion in amazing tools and apps for Bitcoin solving a few of its problems along the way, like usability and transparancy for consumers using BTC, and integration into other platforms like OpenBazzar and others.
Bitcoin is a bottom up technology, not top down. The Internet itself we have today was all in all a 30-40 year effort, blockchain tech will be no differant aside happening a big faster. Though we need to decentralize the Internet itself too, so we have our work cut out for us.

People keep failing to appreciate how small Bitcoin truly is still. Compared to world commerce Bitcoin is a minuscule slice of that pie. 
Visa and Mastercard are still leagues bigger folks.
This stuff takes **years** to fully mature and penetrate various markets, not days or mere months. Though it is certainly possible Bitcoin could reach a "flashpoint" state where suddenly it is everywhere.
Regardless, that is perfectly fine. Bitcoin isn't quite ready for the masses yet anyway. Remember how its still in Beta technically?

Using blockchains to automate financial functions is really where the meat and potatoes is here. 
Imagine a world where you don't have to even think about the mechanics of spending money on things you need. It all just happens automatically underneath slick, easy to use apps. For a business for example- customer pays for product, app automatically replenishes product supply to the business without any human interaction from their suppliers, who pay their suppliers the same way. We will no longer need people in the process at all beyond maintaining the system. Once the product is ordered, the app sets up and pays for the drone delivery service to get it to you, again without a human touching your package at any point. The drone itself is smart enough to buy its own fuel from an automated service station, and hire its own drone technician to fix and maintain it when needed. 
This really is the beginning of the secure, semantic "web 3.0", or the "Internet of Things" as it is now referred to more. This is an industrial revolution and nothing less that is just beginning. We havn't even thought up the coolest shit yet. 
Blockchains, meshnets, intelligent machines that can function autonomously, robots, total personal security and anonymity...the future is bright indeed.

I would trust Coinbase above most others to hold my coins long term.
However, let's keep in mind for 100% security, learn how to create and handle cold wallets of your own.
Coinbase is awesome but is *still a third party* that you are entrusting your BTC to.
If anything use it as a tertiary long term storage along with your home made cold wallets that hold most of your BTC.
Hot Wallet (spending coin): no more than 20% of your coin
Semi-Cold Coinbase Wallet: 10-20%
Cold Wallet: ideally 60-80%

The long term curve seems to be flattening out some, this may already be happening as big miners have no incentive to make the network any larger, as this just screws their profit margin along with everyone elses.

Sure, eventually one must test in the real world. Even still:

US Dollars are a fixed point, Bitcoin is not, so most merchants price in USD and then convert at checkout to whatever the exchange rate currently is.
Typically the Bitcoin turns right back into USD, or most of it does, as their suppliers likely don't accept Bitcoin yet themselves.
To really price in BTC alone, the entire supply chain must be BTC start to finish as well.

Private exchanges have the typical issues that come with any centralized service.
Systems like Counterparty are great and the direction we need to go, but pretty much everything in the crypto-space isn't production ready yet. Counterparty is Beta, Bitcoin itself is still Beta, we're beta testing the future at the moment as these things develop.

I predict Bitcoin, or really blockchains at large, will be one of those things that was nowhere, and then suddenly everywhere.

Price means almost nothing. US Dollars are just as unstable and are not even fundamentally sound. All money based on debt implodes eventually. Dollars will join that list soon. Bitcoin is actually worth something to me, Dollars are about a hairs length from being toilet paper. 
With this technology we can take our world back from greedy bankers and take away their control. We will put our trust in these new digital constitutions instead for everything from governance to resource management. 
What I see is massive development, more and more businesses accepting it, more and more startups building on top of it, bigger and bigger names getting involved.
Just because the price isn't skyrocketing doesn't mean Bitcoin slows down. If anything it is still just getting started. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 00:37:34
Many have one-click OS installs and is actually stupidly simple to set up a server. If you can follow some basic Linux instructions you can have a node up and running in a few minutes, save the day or so to download the whole blockchain. I use Ramnode.com, couldn't be simpler with their interface. 
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:24:38
This is highly true, well said.
I too view the long term, the short term is just good entertainment like this bloodbath today. Plus my short a few weeks ago is looking great, so I can't be happier. 
The price really doesn't have any bearing on Bitcoin's actual health. VCs don't plow $260 Million into something over 2 years that they don't believe in. There is massive development going on, not only with Bitcoin but several other blockchain based projects that are poised to make major, world-changing waves. 
This all reminds me of the despair coming off of the hike to $266 last year, which ultimately crushed all the way down to $40 before actually rebounding. Anyone smart knew Bitcoin was simply on sale, not going away. This could very well be the last time we the 400s after the weak hands are done making emotional trade decisions. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 17:46:47
Bad rap? There has been no detrimental news in weeks. My guess is the price has everything to do with these giant miners selling off to pay the bills.
And its not even money. Bitcoin and blockchains at large are not money, or currency, or an asset. They are transaction protocols, which is something altogether much more powerful. It takes money and turns it into an application.

There is definitely some lofty thinking around here, but I don't disagree that we have not seen the end yet either.
But we must also be realistic. Bitcoin is not even considered finished software yet, anyone who owns BTC at the moment is an early shareholder. And like any business, nothing says Bitcoin doesn't fail someday. 
Bitcoin could be the next world reserve currency, or turn into dust as other more advanced coins and blockchain services supplant it. 
I hold several currencies based on their merits and unique services. It would be foolish to go all into what is still a largely unproven system. Its getting better every day, but that does not mean it is necessarily a good investment either. 
I don't think BTC is done yet and has a lot of potential for long term gains being the largest and most developed, but I won't assume it will rise forever because I am not clairvoyant, anyone claiming to be is a delusional fool. 
I do hold some BTC for the simple fact I trust it far more than the Dollar to still be around in the next 5-10 years. Bitcoins are not stores of debt, Dollars literally are.
@_date: 2014-09-12 21:05:51
China and Russia are rapidly decoupling from the Dollar right now, and the Petrodollar is in big trouble which is really the only thing at all that gives Dollars "value".
But you are correct, every fiat currency that has ever existed has failed, and it always fails for the same reason: pumping the money supply and corruption.
Reserve currency status also only seems to last about 40-60 years, and the US is about at the end of its run.
I think the day will come very soon when we don't valuate Bitcoin in Dollars, because Dollars will be 100% worthless paper by then. Bitcoin will simply be worth what it will buy then.

Schiff's gold business accepts Bitcoin for gold, so he doesn't hate it that much, at least he knows good business when he sees it, even if not entirely sold on the current state of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin cannot ever replace gold, or other precious metals as a store of value, as metal is a real and tangible resource that is limited in supply. Gold doesn't vanish when the power is out. There is gold in circulation that has been moving around the Earth for 1000s of years as money and wealth storage. 
What we will see however is crypto-currencies being used to trade metals worldwide as a true free market, opposed to the heavily bank-manipulated system we have now.

I too had been looking at my options to start training, it seems Python is the most useful, many Bitcoin applications are written in it or have Python versions. It's been said that Python is also a very friendly language to learn as a first compared to others that are much more verbose. 
Javascript is another, which is also useful for web development too (along with HTML and CSS).
But like any project, you have to choose the right tools for the job, some languages may be more apt than others depending on what your goals are.

In the end, Bitcoin, rather the blockchain, will prevent this from happening.
Current Internet services are 100% centralized, which means they are 100% vulnerable to attack, and 100% untrusted on an intrinsic level. 
These are exactly why blockchains are so revolutionary. In this case, blockchains can be used for private key authentication in a distributed way.
Unless hackers of the future can read your mind or reach into your physical safe at home where your private keys are stored on paper, this is how authentication is going to work in the future. 
Usernames and passwords on a private database are about to be a dead concept.

Well, given fiat currency has a 100% chance of total failure worldwide in the coming years, I think Bitcoin, and blockchains for that matter, will have a 100% chance of being fiat's replacement. 
Bitcoin itself? Who knows. Blockchains? Say hello to our financial future no matter what shape it takes. Keep in mind, Bitcoin is *a* application of blockchains, not *the* application.

All of these, including Bitcoin itself, are still in **beta**. There is not technically a Bitcoin 1.0 yet.

The real problem is that money transmitter laws only apply if you are a large business who can afford the application process. It does not cover at all small time operators, and basically locks them out of this market since paying for the paperwork is impossibly expensive.
Legislation and fees must be adjusted to allow smaller exchange businesses to exist without being steamrolled because the can't afford idiotic state and Federal bureaucracy.
But I think what will actually happen is eventually small time exchanges will be so numerous the regulatory agencies will be completely overloaded going after them all. They cannot logistically go after every single one. 
Though since major banks are allowed to do these things ad nauseum with nothing more than a tiny fee basically, I don't see why small time ops have to abide by these stupid, slow, unproductive layers of legislation either.
Once distributed exchanges exist, these bodies of un-progress will be eradicated one way or another when their very purpose no longer has meaning in the cryptocurrency world. That is the real point of blockchains. Replacing regulatory bodies and paper laws with unbending computer code.

The problem is more that all of the hot money coming out of the Federal Reserve printing press is essentially being funneled into Wall Street and big banks, all of which now have insanely huge derivative risk and causes margin debt as well. 
In fact, combined it is estimated that there is a financial bomb to the tune of $500-1500 **Trillion** Dollars (or up to *$1.5 Quadrillion*). The global GDP is only around $65 Trillion, so there is not enough money on this planet to fix it should one of these banks go down in flames. It is a house of cards that would be unable to take a huge shock. If they bailed it out the Dollar would be hyper inflated into worthless paper. 
Bitcoin however is grounded in a finite universe where there is not infinite currency creation. Most of the bullshit banks do today is not possible when you cannot just make up phony numbers in a computer. Fractional Reserve banking is a scam through and through, Bitcoin is easily the fairest financial system humanity has ever devised.  Nothing wrong with derivatives, but monetary pumping of the currency always causes massive distortions in the markets.

Nearly everyone in this thread is an asshole. I find it upsetting that this gentleman created a pool, and all of you are just dumping on it like he shouldn't have even bothered to do it. 
He built a P2Pool, regardless of how "easy" it is or not, or what SMALL fee he wants to charge to keep the server online (VPS and rackspace generally isn't free), that is good for Bitcoin mining. It should be encouraged to set up a node. Is 1.75% really that unreasonable? Out of every 1 BTC mined that amounts to .0175 BTC. Even with a lot of hashpower on the node, getting 1 BTC of shares takes a pretty long time. 
If it is so easy where are all of your free nodes then you greedy dicks? Put up or shut up.
@_date: 2014-06-25 19:45:44

Most of those "toxic" people don't have the skill and/or motivation to actually contribute to solving the problems.
There is a massive difference between people who just bitch on a forum somewhere, and those who actually do the work to fix things and build out the protocol.

Of course we are.
Mining wasn't a multi-million dollar industry in 2012, now it is.
Bitcoin wasn't a $6-8 Billion business then, now it is.
The Bitcoin economy is now much larger than it was then.
Block halving significantly shifts Bitcoin's economics, and will have some profound affects. Every miner and pool will effectivley earn 50% less BTC. If the price doesn't rise to match from the sudden halving of supply, they are going to be in for a big world of hurt. 
Though trans fees will eventually be a miners primary revenue, which I think  through increased transaction will make up the difference or better. We shall see.

The government track record for suppressing distributed technology is highly bad.

It's just a continued reminder that our financial system is a rickety, insecure, complicated mess that can go no further technologically or fundamentally.

Yeah...but generally no one actually knows how the fiat money system works either, and never question it. They don't have any problem entering in 10 pieces of information to buy something online with a credit card, how is one piece (the BTC address) more complex?
If anyone has ever used an app to buy something, or even a banking website, I don't see how Bitcoin is any more or less complicated than that. If anything it is easier in practice.
Could it be better? Absolutely, and that is happening every day to make it better and more transparent for mere mortals.

If you cannot support a full connection, don't put up a Core node, you won't be helping the network.

I don't hold Doge, or smoke crack. 21 Million is an arbitrary number, it could have been anything they wanted when they coded it. Plus since you are so good at math, by giving Bitcoin 8 decimal places, the real number actually is 21 Trillion units, not 21 Million. That represents 21 Million units of 100 Million smaller units each. Dividing a single unit of currency anything beyond 2 places just gets confusing quickly.

Not quite.
1 Bob deposits 1 coin to the bank.
2 Bank lends 90% of the coin to Alice, and 10% is kept on *reserve* for Bob in case he wants some of his money
3 Alice deposits her loan her account. 10% is kept on *reserve* in case Alice wants some of her funds later.
4 Bank loans out 90% of Alice's deposit to John.
And the cycle keeps repeating.
This is actually how money creation works in Fractional Reserve, with the Federal Reserve providing the seed to start the process by selling bonds to the US Government, which is owed back to the FED plus interest. Its more complicated than this though. Every time this cycle occurs there are more US Dollars in existence since the bank just creates them out of thin air. 
Basically it is a giant ponzi scheme built on debt.

Bitcoin is built to be inflationary until 21 Million, then deflationary once Bitcoin production ceases and miners income is 100% transaction fees. After that point there will only be less Bitcoin in the world as they are lost or destroyed. There will already be less than 21 Million as many have already been lost. 
The inflationary period also slows down continually as well until zero through block reward halving. Now it is 25 BTC, next it will be 12.5, 6.25, etc until 21 Million are created.

We needed something to replace this heap of fail. Bitcoin (blockchains) are it. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 16:15:24
The real magic of blockchains is that they are self regulated with no need for unenforceable rules on top that are paper/people driven.
In a true free market scenario bad actors are allowed to die and what is economically superior and desirable lives on. 
Today bad actors are not only rewarded and bailed out if they fail, but solidified into our society through regulations that benefit only a few people.

Bitcoin actually punishes big miners in the end. 
If only a few miners hold most of the network, any one of them adding crazy hashpower only serves to screw the profit margins of all of them and themselves, as every hash makes solving blocks harder to do. At some point it makes no sense for anyone to add any more hashpower. Transaction volume would need to go much higher so the fees compensate.

Yes I realize a Dollar is broken into 100 smaller pieces, but that is my point. Anything after that and it gets confusing real fast.
1 Bitcoin is currently like if 1 Dollar = 100 Million cents. 
100 Satoshi = 1 Bit is just an arbitrary, meaningless value. Why not just call the lowest unit Bitcoin up to 100 Million?

@_date: 2014-07-08 19:53:23
Let's all remember too that we valuate Bitcoin in Dollars, but the Dollar is currently dying. All world fiat currencies are dieing. Bitcoin is valued in unstable, fundamentally flawed fiat currency. 
The problem with Fractional Reserve is that the system relies on never ending debt. It only inflates the currency supply. It needs a world of never ending growth, jobs, and resources, which is not the reality we live in. We are at peak everything, the only place left to go is downward.
Every Dollar is a storage of **debt** owed back to the Federal Reserve. 
I believe at some point a Bitcoin will simply be worth what a Bitcoin will buy outright, and valuating in Dollars won't reflect Bitcoin's actual value in goods and services. 
All I see is tons of VC capital and massive development efforts. The price doesn't mean anything, the activity of the community speaks for itself.

You must wonder what institutional bankers have running through their minds now. 
Though at the rate I am seeing warnings issued from banks admitting now that the S&amp;P is no doubt completely overvalued, for example, are they eyeing Bitcoin as a way out of their mess? If fiat currency goes down in flames worldwide, it may be the only option left. We might see yet a world where banks return to their main function as lenders of capital that can only lend what they actually have in their digital vault. 
Regardless, just like the advent of the Internet, business will either adapt or die.

Not a chance in hell the devs would ever do such a thing. They themselves noted doing so would destroy what Bitcoin is fundamentally as it makes the currency non fungible.

The US Dollar is built on a system that requires perpetual debt to function. By function there must always be more debt than real wealth. This cycle has happened many times through history with fiat currencies (Weimar Republic is one recent example). The root of the problem is that the money issuers always get corrupt and debase the money supply. The world we live in today is a 300 year old scam by international super-bankers like the Rothschilds that convinced governments to let them issue the nations currency and enslave that government with war debt. 
The centralization of this system has also led to absolute corruption at the highest levels, allowing few people to control most of Earth's real wealth: our limited natural resources. Fiat currency requires there to be infinite growth, jobs, and resources. This is not our reality. A fixed resource cannot be represented by an unfixed means of trading those resources. 
Bitcoin, and blockchains at large represent the end of this paradigm. Open source now has a transaction layer that monetizes innovation in a way never before possible in finance.
Just remember: The US Dollar does not represent wealth, it is a claim check on the debt owed back to the Federal Reserve. I happily have more Bitcoin than I do fiat currency. 
I highly recommend The Secrets of Money by Mike Mallony to better understand how all this really works and how money has evolved through history. 
Exciting years ahead.

Bitcoin is currently a victim of its own success. With major retails going from BTC to USD directly there is some downward pressure because of this.

I paid .1 BTC for just shy of 2000 Storjcoin X. With exchange rates that amounts to $.02 each.

Basically, if you want a free one transaction, the system makes you wait a little longer. A the optional fees are just that if you want yours in the system quicker.
That said, compared to standard banking and credit card rates, BTC is still infinitely cheaper. No overdraft fees because that is impossible. No fees to store or use your BTC (I've seen ATMs charge up to $4.00 to use your own money), etc.
And the best part: no middle men between you and your business.

Changing the total cap would make Bitcoin no better than fiat currency then, as its main issue (aside being based on *debt*) is those in charge just print up what they want when they want, causing hyperinflation of the currency which drops its value (US Dollars have lost 98% of their value since 1913), which typically ends in a deflationary market crash. I believe with the current state of the world, this is about to happen everywhere. 
But that is the other elegant thing about Bitcoin: no one person or group has the authority to do this. They would have to create a fork of Bitcoin with a modified upper limit, and others would have to accept or reject that code. This is the democratic nature of this currency that I think too many people overlook the significance of. 
With Dollars, the cronies that run the Federal Reserve (private bank) can just create as much money as they want, and no US citizen can stop this alone.

That is unfortunate but your choice.

The drop has nothing to do with any of this bullshit you have there. Arrests of traders? Wtf are you going on about? A couple bad actors do not represent the whole. What little regulation has come to pass has barely made a dent unless you are an exchange on US soil. Laundering laws apply to everyone not just Bitcoin traders and the like. 
Getting one's hands on BTC could be easier, but we're getting there. Not enough ATMs? The fact that there are as many as there are now is nothing short of amazing. There was a time there were none you know. More and more are getting deployed. Hoops? Coinbase has been no more difficult to use than my bank's website to buy BTC with ease. 
 the fuck? Is this based on an actual event or are you just making shit up? No one is getting arrested for spending Bitcoin,  people are buying things with Bitcoin every day. So should I start looking out for the police because I bought a few domains on Namecheap with BTC? Hardly think so. 
Supply of Bitcoin is simply greater than the demand for them  is, so the price is getting hammered. That is how a market works. It could be going down simply because traders believe it will, which then usually it does because that is just the sentiment. Anything outside of this basic principal is pure speculative hogwash really. You don't know any of that for sure. 
This whole post is garbage. Id like to see any government enforce their little bans for real. They logistically have no way to do this.

It's up to the SEC ultimately to approve it. The Winklevoss ETF is making progress though.

Bits is the dumbest nomenclature to use. It is already overused in technology and only adds to the confusion for regular people. 
I will never call them "bits". This does not solve the core issue of Bitcoin's decimal system being at home in an engineers mind but not a general users mind. They should have made it resemble fiat currency so it's not so jarring, but they didn't. A minor flaw, but one easily fixed I think. 
Here is what we should do instead-
Make .00000001 = 1 Bitcoin. Really when you think about it, 1 Bitcoin currently represents 100 Million smaller pieces (satoshis). What logical sense does that make? Do we divide 1 Dollar by a 100 Million? No, we just count up to 100 Million Dollars. 
Just make the smallest unit 1 Bitcoin  (Make 100 Million Bitcoin = 1 Satoshi, seems like a finer homage to me). Up the cap to 21,000,000,000,000 BTC, and in this kills another misconception that 21 Million is not enough Bitcoin for everyone. 
This is a pretty minor change, nothing about how Bitcoin works has to change at all to implement it. We just have to adjust our nomenclature. I suppose the code could be altered to better reflect it, but why? Numbers are all the same to a machine. 
Thats my proposal.
*1 Bitcoin  = .00000001 internally
*1 Satoshi = 100 Million Bitcoin = 1 internally
Plus we get the benefit of being able to say we own a few million Bitcoin :)

The only way to do that is turn it into the system as it is right now: a private banking system run by a small cabal of uber super villain fuckheads. 
This is how this happened in the first place. Banks convinced governments to let them issue the national currency. When the state needs a big loan for war, the bank has the country by the balls through debt. In exchange, they give the bank the natural resources of the country on the cheap.
So, this is also a big driver on war. No war = no loans to governments = less control for oligarchs. They fund both sides to make a buck and gain more control for themselves like a game of Risk, but for real. 
Bitcoin will never belong to these coward rat bastards, because Bitcoin belongs to everyone who holds it.

Bitcoin Core only maintains the global record (blockchain). Each node is really just a global relay to keep things updated between your node and others, as well as API data and the like. Ideally your node is able to serve many others as a persistent connection. Full node deployments are still very important, the more the better for a highly distributed mesh. So, please do run a few in different locations if possible. 
Miners actually confirm transactions which Bitcoin Core keeps synchronized. But, miners/full nodes are both nothing all alone. 
Core is just a gateway to the network though, things must be built upon it to really have value to the network. As a programmer that part might appeal to you.

What you are forgeteting is that the 3rd party service like Coinbase are gateways between Bitcoin and Dollars (or other fiat currency).
They must be registered businesses by the SEC and a bunch of other agencies. Paperwork is long and expensive. There is no getting around this if Bitcoin is to interface with legacy banking.
Their main service to businesses is instant BTC to Dollars on every transaction. If you don't require this, you don't actually need Bitpay to take a payment form a customer. They just provide some nice tools that make it easy for a business to jump in at any level. Absolutely nothing is stopping anyone from implementing their own Bitcoin store with the protocol. 
You seem to have zero concept of what these companies even do. They do not comprise the Bitcoin network, they are just options in a sea of options.

Thats because fiat is literally a storage of debt (fractional reserve currencies are debt based folks. No debt = no dollars in circulation). How does one save debt?
gold, art, etc are tangible items with intrinsic value that surpass worthless paper. No matter our agreed unit of exchange, these things will still likely have a value in that system to someone, making them a storage of wealth. 
I buy Bitcoin today because I honestly don't believe fiat currency will be worth anything at all within 10 years, perhaps sooner. We as early adopters have front row seats to what might be a mad dash out of fiat when everyone loses faith in it eventually, and when they come trying to buy my Bitcoin, the price will be mighty high. This has occurred many times in history, and is set to happen again pretty soon.

And, the promise is on demand cloud storage. Whether it is cheaper than dropbox depends on if you maximize your dropbox service or not. Most never use all the storage they buy. It would be cheaper to pay for exactly what you really used in most cases. But we will see.

This is how I thought a real Bitcoin based government would operate. A government's primary purpose is to protect the liberties of its citizens.
Without the ability to just print up as much currency as needed to fund war (endebting the government to the bank for life as well), government would have to crowd fund it.
That means the public would really, really have to agree we must defend ourselves and fund it ourselves.
Since war is really expensive in both money and blood, Bitcoin funded wars would be extremely short if there were any at all. During the period where gold was the standard and there were no banks, wars tended to last only a few weeks or months at most.
The American people never wanted to go to Iraq, for example. If the Federal Government had tried to fund it publicly there is no way it would have happened. But that is the rub now: citizens here have zero power of what our government does.
"Want to go to war? Great! Call up the FED for a war loan and lets go! Our people are against it? Oh well, what do they know."

Though without merchants, there would not be customers. Customers who can't spend Bitcoin on stuff they want and/or need have no reason to use Bitcoin over Dollars. Bitcoin needs to penetrate the everyday lives of people before you see mass adoption.

It's not loser talk to tell someone who just came into a huge amount of money to take it easy and don't make any rash decisions at first.
Many get that kind of cash suddenly and blow it in a few months on bullshit because they see it as "spending spree! Vacations! expensive cars and house!" instead of "this will change my life forever if I manage it properly"
It is wise to keep your job for a minute, hire a CPA to help you secure your assets in a sustainable way, and have more of a plan than "wooo party!".
I bet you are the kind of person who would blow this cash quickly and recklessly. It isn't about "enjoying" the money, its about making sure you can enjoy its benefits long term and not for a couple years until you're broke and having all your cool shit repossessed, ending at the same shitty job you left in the first place. 
Is his decision wise? I don't think so. He became a multi-millionaire because of his holdings, and he sold ALL of it? If I was BTC rich, I would definitely retain a stash long term for even more gains later. I'm sure backpacking is cheap enough in the face of $2 Million, but again, it reeks of lack of planning and "fuck it". Not smart.

Paypal represents the end of the line as far as fiat payments over the Internet go. It will literally never get any better than that, because the underlying fiat infrastructure (slow, insecure, centralized, run by crony capitalists and lobbyists, built on ancient tech) won't change either.
Bitcoin, or blockchains at large rather, are transaction systems that solve these problems as the first true currency of the Internet, built just for it.
Fiat was merely adapted to the Internet, and there is nowhere left to go there technologically.

I think Google is a sleeping giant in this space. You know they are watching it closely. I would think cryptocurrencies would serve them very well as part of their app ecosystem, and help monetize them with micro-payments.

With the advent of Openstack, Docker and other tools this will definitely be how it is later.

The monetary system is complicated, and that is by design.

The FED is nothing more than the top of a global banker ponzi scheme. However, it seems this dominance is rapidly coming to an end as the system buckles under its own weight. Bitcoin has perfect timing.

Mostly because Apple makes it as difficult as fucking possible to get into their app ecosystem. And they proved highly unfriendly to Bitcoin in the past.
Though they are allowing some now, I think they still despise it. It was only allowed to stop the complaining, not actually because they believe in it the way Dell, Newegg, and others seem to. 
Fuck IOS anyway. Apple's model is proprietary everything, which is not long for this world with the advance of open source. 
Why should Blockchain, Coinbase an others feel compelled to jump through Apple's hoops. They will just support open platforms instead which is why Android is a lightyear ahead of IOS in the Bitcoin app department.

Agreed. I think 95% of the alts are garbage clones. But there are a few with some interesting and promising applications of a blockchain for a particular purpose, and have strong devs and communities behind them. I own Storj and some Darkcoin for these reasons, I believe they have interesting and useful merits that Bitcoin does not have. 
Everyone wants Bitcoin to have all these features but I think it needs to remain pure. Feature bloat is not what will make Bitcoin truly special. It just needs to be secure, which is Bitcoin's best attribute. I think it will eventually be the glue holding service networks like Storj together, acting as a universal, global reserve currency and means of exchange.

I think the network effect is starting to steal the thunder from even the best of the alts, because:
None of the alts come even close to Bitcoin's cap
None of the alts come even close to Bitcoin's infrastructure/network size
None of the alts have millions of Dollars pouring into into it from investors
I myself sold off all my alts and went full Bitcoin for this reason on the long haul. 
Bitcoin is not infallible by any means, but I think it will be here long after most of the other alts have gone. I see the altcoins as experimental Bitcoin implementations, because that is what they are. They are invaluable for research, and some of those changes do in fact make it into Bitcoin itself (Litecoin has shared a few things). The best features of these alts will be a part of Bitcoin eventually, because that is how open source works.

We shouldn't think of Bitcoin as a currency anyway. It is a protocol, I think will be the equivalent of TCP/IP for money and assets. 
Bitcoin is just the base layer for far more that will integrate with higher specialized chains above it in a full crypto-economy. The distributed cloud will handle every service from blogs, forums, DNS, websites, etc. Autonomous agents and robotic businesses will handle everything automatically from manufacturing to purchase, even smart enough to sell itself for salvage once obsolete and picked up via automated drone to the recycler. 
In this sense, yes Bitcoin is a fantastic investment long term, as I believe long term the world is in for a big change, and blockchains will be at the heart of this third industrial revolution.

There will still need to be humans to design and operate our technology. Robots and automation will simply remove the most laborious and monotonous areas, like being a factory worker who literally does what a machine could be doing faster. 
An example is 3D printing houses. No need for construction crews anymore as we know them. They will be robotics engineers and 3D printing experts. Much of construction will be totally automated. 
This frees us from menial tasks and lets us start asking and answering the bigger questions, getting paid in Bitcoin for our time innovating the next steps.

I say "with Bitcoin, you get to be your own bank. No one has control of your money but you". I definitely mention the low fees when speaking to a business owner, usually their ears perk up a bit when noting using Bitcoin would save them a lot of money on credit card processing fees. 
It just depends on who you are talking to.

There is only moar money and development around this every year so far. This year alone Bitcoin has over $200 Million backing new startups. Give it a few months to a year and these startups will start coming out with some serious software. 
At some point a critical mass will be reached eventually, and we will see blockchains integrated into literally everything.

Though, when you tell someone 1 Bitcoin is actually 100 Million satoshi, they look at you like you're insane. 
I would almost propose we put Bitcoin in satoshi's place (.00000001 = 1 Bitcoin), and up the cap to 21 Quadrillion or whatever it is. Because when you really look at it, this is actually how it is, the nomenclature doesn't really make any sense. This would both eliminate people thinking 21 Million coins isn't nearly enough for worldwide distribution, as well as killing the "bits" problem by just having the lowest unit be 1 Bitcoin and work up from there. 
I dunno, ultimately this whole issue I think stems from the fact an engineer (or group of engineers) created this without much forethought to practical use issues like this.

There does seem to be a need for some kind of a "proof of project", not idea how that could work though.
But in open source the proof is in the pudding. I would be very wary of anyone posting a project on this with nothing to show but a promise. Code is free, open source is free, there is no reason anyone shouldn't have an alpha at very least before requesting funds to develop it further.

This is not a simple currency, but an entirely new way of doing business with each other that has profound implications. It will take some time for Bitcoin to mature. It is still in **beta** afterall :)

Other previously pro-Dollar countries are also destroying it on purpose. BRICS isn't screwing around, they are basically forming a Dollar seperatist movement between them to end reliance with the US.

Though, the entire system is still based on flawed Keynesian mechanics and will all fail together sooner than later.

No. Taxes are unconstitutional. There is actually no US law stating you have to pay taxes, you can if you want to. But the powers that be make sure people get punished anyway so no one thinks about it or even checks.

Some members of our government use it as toilet paper.
In a way, that piece of paper really has gone as far as it can ideologically. I like to think the founding fathers really did draft it hoping for something better. Unfortunately the problem is human in that centralized institutions inevitably become corrupted. Jefferson's presidential campaign was built on destroying the first private bank that attempted to hijack the currency, and he won (the Federal Reserve is in fact the third and final attempt at subverting the young US government, and it worked exactly as planned). 
Ultimately international bankers are to blame for the worlds problems today. They've hijacked governments, shit on their citizens, and corrupted every level of infrastructure. Mass media is their propaganda wing, the US their military arm, and they answer to no one. 
Blockchains are now going to start hijacking their ill gotten state.

I've found no matter what it is difficult to explain this to anyone in one sentence, because it really is that alien compared to the financial system everyone has used their entire life. 
But the thing is that most people don't understand what Fractional Reserve banking is or how that works either, but still use it daily. 
The transition won't come from explaining this to anyone like a sales pitch, it will come from loss of faith in the current system. This is when normal people start seeking alternatives. Bitcoin is the only direction to go when crony fiat currency finally implodes like it always does.

This is where OpenBazzar and Storj type applications come in. These offer actual services as a distributed network. Bitcoin integration with these services will be the bread and butter. 
Merchant acceptance is great but isn't doing as much as people think. Their supply lines are not moving in BTC, they are still moving in fiat. This is why they tend to insta-convert to Dollars. For true economic fuction the loop must be closed. Right now that Bitcoin transaction instantly becomes a Bitcoin sale to fiat and it ends there. 
I believe in time Bitcoin will simply be the glue that moves between these service blockchains as a universal reserve currency to which the value of all other coins/tokens is pinned, much like everything being pegged to the Dollar today.

FDIC insurance covers a very, very small amount of the total sum of all deposits covered. In a major crisis this would fold like a house of cards fast and be exhausted immediately. 
I'm ready for comments to stop that support and defend a corrupt, unfeasible debt based monetary system because of ignorance. Nothing is safe in fiat, and few actors hold all the cards and control. Central banking has been a 300 year ponzi scheme that is nearing its end as the system breaks under debt. 
Bitcoin is not currency, it is not stock, it is not a commodity either. It is an amalgam of all three concepts, which is what makes Bitcoin unique and not classifiable by classical monetary classifications. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 22:55:06
Fractional reserve is the practice of loaning out more money than one actually has.  It also is a mechanism to inflate the money supply with no end. 
Banks are only required to keep 10% of your deposit on deck in case you want some, the rest they can loan out to someone else, who puts it in their account, and the bank is free to again loan out 90% of your deposit. Rince and repeat forever.
This isn't possible in Bitcoin unless it is coded to work that way, but it does not.
In Bitcoin, you can only loan what you actually have.

I'm not worried, these things cannot be forced. The advent of the Internet provoked just as much backflak, and now no one in the developed world can imagine a world without the Internet. Bitcoin is in the same kind of place right now, edging on mainstream but still has rough edges to be sorted out. 
It's not even really a problem with Bitcoin either. Most people simply have zero understanding of how the current economy and money system works. You get just as many blank stares trying to explain that to anyone as you do with Bitcoin, as both concepts are totally foreign to them. 
It's tragically funny to me that most people are unaware most of our money already is digital, yet act so confused by Bitcoin in this way. Bitcoin is no harder to use than any banking website or debit card really, and is far more secure.

It is best to think of it as a protocol and not so much a "currency" you are familiar with.
Bitcoin represents the real revelation that is *blockchains*, distributed ledgers of account agreed upon by 100s and 1000s of computers. These can be applied to just about anything of economic value.
Basically, it provides a transaction system to the Cloud, a solid base layer for a brand new kind of economy with the power to rebalance power from centralist oligarchs. 
Today we have Bitcoin that is functioning more like a reserve, basic currency to which all others will be pegged. On top of Bitcoin we have Storj for example, a distributed cloud storage system based on the same blockchain technology.
Bandwidth, computing power, energy, storage, automated cars, you name it, will someday have a blockchain at its heart. Intelligent trade and finance between the Internet of Things.
Needless to say, it could be the the way to a truly free market economy with ZERO middlemen skimming off the top providing nothing to humanity.

Though this next block halving will occur with a much more mature industry than it was during the first one. 
Big miners will probably care about half their rewards disappearing after dumping millions of dollars into their mines. However transaction fees should gradually replace a miner's income in lough of block rewards. The decrease in BTC supply could also increase the value of mined BTC to compensate somewhat.
But who knows, Bitcoin is still a grand experiment.

Overall I believe the message here is simple:
Bitcoin's infrastructure is badly underdeveloped still. Mining is a mishmash of half-finished protocols with no unified platform under it. 
But, let's all remind ourselves that Bitcoin Core itself is still in Beta. This whole technology is. There was a time the Internet itself was in the same state of things with tons of problems. But with time those problems were solved. 
Also remember, Mike Hearn is in fact doing something about this to make Bitcoin development easier to fund and democratize:

Bitcoin has:
A lively developing ecosystem of applications and decentralized tools
Millions and millions of dollars in VC and investor capital flowing in
Some of the best talent in the world on the dev teams.
Giant, multi-billion dollar companies joining up to sell their wares for Bitcoin
Mass ATM deployments
Dogecoin has:
...a meme?
...a no name Nascar driver?
Look, the reality is that Dogecoin was fun while it lasted but now even I find it annoying. It's one of 1000 coins just like it without any real development push. Network effect will eventually render all the alts dead to Bitcoin and other coins that actually do something useful beyond existing. This is why people are dumping their alts for Bitcoin, because Bitcoin has infrastructure and big money to keep pushing the edge.
Don't get me wrong, for all the charitable things the Dogecoin crowd has done I do commend them highly on that. Bitcoin would be better off if the lot of you came to the winning side and install the loving atmosphere that got Doge off the ground in the first place to the surprise of everyone. 
Want my advice: buy into the projects with real promise and solid teams behind them. I'm invested in mostly Bitcoin, and a bit of Storjcoin. I too held Litecoin and Doge, and some others for a while, until I realized that was stupid for the reasons above.

Try your local credit union. Mine has zero issue with this. I even spoke with their compliance officer just to make sure.

Wistful thinking and voodoo math on profitability or just looking for a cheap way to experience Bitcoin mining as a little hobby. At the time these were in fact the cheapest ASICs you could get, because they were the only USB miner around.

I've been around since the April 2013 spike to $266, this doesn't scare me.
Buy up the cheap coins kids, by the time everyone is done with proclaiming the death of Bitcoin or whatever it will skyrocket once more.

Pretty nice of Russia to want to help debug and further secure Tor. Let them, I don't think this will do what they think it will.

Quick fix:
Print up some paper wallets, and give them a small fraction of Bitcoin. This should break their perceptions pretty quick.
Aside that though, the decimal system used in Bitcoin is in fact highly unfortunate in hindsight. Keeping its outward appearance closer to fiat currency would have been better. We can do that by moving the decimal over a few places for common writing, but isn't going to be widely adopted until (if?)BTC price goes way up.

Regardless, I would trust a decentralized, crypto-secure system like Storj over trusting Apple with anything of mine that is sensitive and private.
In the end remember one thing: A real systems tech is at the end of the line somewhere, with full access to everything that resides on their *private servers*.
Nothing says someone at Apple doesn't pull a Snowden and walk away with half their database. This isn't possible with a blockchain.

There was one motion moving in stealth to create a union of Canada, N.America, and Mexico along with a new currency called Amero. Whether that plan included S. America at some point I don't know.
Not sure how much truth there really is to this, but it is out there.

The answer is meshnet. 
The largest meshnet in existence is called Hyperboria, which uses the CJDNS protocol, which is meant to replace TCP/IP which drives the current Internet.
In this kind of network, you would be getting your connection from your neighbors instead of an ISP.
With meshnests and blockchains, we already are rebuilding the Internet from the ground up.

Yeah, fuck "bits". Whoever proposed that is an idiot.
Yes, lets use one of the most overused techie sounding terms there can be as a denomination...
Are we that fucking lazy? There is not a single real person the denomination could be named after? I don't mean to sound angry, but I really do hate "bits" and refuse to ever call them that. Does "bits" go with "satoshis"? The hell it does.
I am not opposed to changing the default decimal place to something more familiar to fiat money, in fact it needs done to break this perception that Bitcoin is expensive when in fact 1 BTC is 100 Million smaller pieces. Something closer to representing $1 in value would ease public view of this alien currency. 
How about naming it after Hal Finney, or anyone else who was involved in Bitcoin's creation? Come on Bitcoiners, we're better than "bits". Lets come up with a real name.

That isn't what they are doing. Using anything other than US Dollars for commerce is technically illegal, the bill aims to legitimize alternative systems like Bitcoin legal tender in the state.
California cannot claim anything beyond their own border. Whether other states do something similar or even at the Federal level is not up to them.

Any good trader is one who leaves their panic at the door, and that's why. If you can't handle your investment hitting the skids emotionally then investing is probably not for you. Bitcoin requires some longer term thinking. 
I've been around long enough $100 swings are childs play.

Many Bitcoin devs run their own money generating projects outside of Bitcoin core development. This is where they actually make their living.
The core itself is a community work for the benefit of all. Bitcoin itself is a protocol, even a business tool, not a business itself. It is those who build businesses with Bitcoin who earn. 
Not to say core devs shouldn't get something for their time. Perhaps something like Mike Hearn's Lighthouse can help with that problem and make general core dev more open.

I think the Internet itself will go to zero. It is just as centralized and privatized as fiat currency is. We can't call Bitcoin "decentralized" when it is not. The network relies on privatized energy and privatized Internet. These things must be decentralized as well.
Meshnets however will rise up alongside blockchains to decentralize the net as well.

Between corporations, banks, and governments, they create laws that apply to the rest of us but not to them.
They are fucking untouchable. Immune to the "law" because they created it to benefit them. 
This is a 300 year consolidation of power and nothing more to the hands of a few. 
Bitcoin is the end of this bullshit charade of a monetary system, and will set us free for the very first time with a true free market. 
We're setting the old world on fire, I'll be there to piss on the ashes of the banks.

Bitcoin is far ahead of Dogecoin in VC capital, infrastructure, development, etc. 
I don't think Doge will ever beat Bitcoin in those ways, because network effect sends the best talent and funding to the one that is the biggest and most worth it to contribute to. 
Why would a big VC back Doge over Bitcoin? From their perspective Bitcoin is a much surer bet on getting a return.
Doge was fun but let's get real, Doge is dieing. Alt chains need to do more than simply exist, they must solve a problem. Doge is not solving anything Bitcoin is not already.  Doge needs a highly valuable service to attach itself to.

I think anything fiat related will be bloody until the end, because centralized authorities are essentially attempting to force trade in their currencies at the end of a gun. The defense of the Petrodollar is basically a protection racket run by international banks.
The destruction of the Dollar, and Petrodollar, have been moving for some time. China and Russia are done with the US and their meddling, making a huge bilateral trade agreement in yuan/ruble, middle east countries are trying to sell oil for gold and their local currencies, other such Dollarless trade agreements are being made around the world.
The USA is in deep, deep shit, with no way out as the international community gives us a big middle finger for all we've done around the world. The party is over, and we as citizens are going to get stuck with a pretty ugly check.

I think just lots of good news lately, media has been pushing it up all week. Even publications that have been sort of anti-Bitcoin in the past are on positive spin mode.
Google trends for Bitcoin is back on the rise out of a bottom, I think the next rally might be starting up sooner than later.
