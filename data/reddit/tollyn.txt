Good news! It shows that a majority of people  care about the price movement of bitcoin. Now BTC is increasingly recognized as an investment tool.

It's no good anymore. It got hacked, and the value crashed to nothing.

I use bitcoind. Because I think everyone should use a full node and because I'm a linux terminal weirdo.

Can't say I'm surprised. We can take long discussions about US "democracy", but guyz in China or Russia ban everything faster and stronger, if they feel any threat from it.

That is a very cool story. There is a good chance he regrets selling his BTC though.

Nice idea!

so the next time I visit Moscow, I can leave my visa card at home.
Bitcoins will be easier to use than trying to get whatever Russian credit card that is.

I can understand you. The number of bits is mindblown

I think if the Bitcoin Developers do not start creating a demand for bitcoin it will continue to fall down. It seems they are just sitting back dumping it much like other places, waiting for it to either collapse or for someone else to do what they should be doing and creating a demand for it. with no demand for their coin, it will fail. The newest places accepting bitcoin are not helping secure its future, when they are picked up the value does not increase, like DELL, why because its not creating a demand for the coin, new people are not rushing out to buy it, they are just simply giving a way for people who already have bitcoins to unload their coins, and in turn places like dell just dumnp them for fiat, this system only pushes the value of bitcoin down, because for the moment demand is not the value setting point for bitcoin, what is setting its value right now is simply the people buying it and selling it on the market, and right now the sellers are winning

I saw this article on new Argentine regulations to severely curtail online imports to protect the Argentinean economy from the terrors of Amazon, and it got me really antsy about a currency collapse there:
As such, my next natural reaction was to wonder if it was possible for me (an American) to sell Bitcoins to people inside of Argentina, in exchange for goods shipped to me? It sounds like they have a pretty severe clamp on receiving shipments internationally, but are there any effective regulations to keep Argentinians sending out packages of Gold, Silver, Magic Cards, etc? To be honest, at this point working to get BTC into Argentina seems as much a mission of mercy as anything.

Honestly I thought that the number of ATM in the world would have been higher, but I know that the count is increasing monthly.

It would take a monumental recalibration of the regulatory regimes in most developing nations for btc to really serve the under-banked

Not being many details it could be a scam so best to not get too over excited until more details if they are, are released. On a good note though a bitcoin island party does sound like a lot of fun to attend.
@_date: 2014-08-18 05:32:22
In my opinion, if Satoshi is still alive, he will wait to spend bitcoins untill the adoption will be complete,
there's no reason to spend them if they are increasing in value every year with this ratio.

Coinbase is technically a broker, but there is coinbase.

Quick question for those more familiar: I know that more and more merchants are accepting bitcoin but is there anyone out there who is working on or has established a bitcoin marketplace yet? 
Bitcoin's amazon/ebay etc. where merchants can migrate to dealing exclusively in bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-07-13 17:33:26
Never head this before. Interesting.

The key now is to get the next level of penetration. Hotels accepting bit coin directly would be huge. It would be a nice role for escrow services as well to hold reservations and release funds once the cut off time is reached or release them back to the originator if they cancel.

The negative psychology of owning fractions of a bitcoin is a real adoption barrier that needs addressing. It is one of the issues that dogecoin have successfully addressed.

I would shorten the confirmation time. Ten minutes is a convenient number but there is no need for it to be so long. There are benefits to a shorter time. I would take a look at propagation times and the orphan block statistics of alt coins, and come up with a better shorter time.

Brilliant and original point (no surprise, considering the thinker). Excessive "consumerism" driven NOT by greed or instability, rather by federal government $ creation.

Dark Wallet is a great project and implementation.  The name works for what the functionality is but it is not going to help with messaging to the masses.  Cash Wallet might have been better since you really can't trace cash very well and then people might get it that it is just the same.  People who want to be off the grid use Cash.
This is not a product for the masses but those that wish to use the full benefits of what the block chain can offer.
Again, overall a good product.

So they sent you an email that basically says oh hey, we got hacked but have absolutely zero evidence it happened, and anyway you weren't affected and even if you were, nobody knows? And you want to do what about it?
Did you at least ask if you got any bitcoin?
