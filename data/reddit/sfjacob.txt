Can you go into a bit more how to set it up once in better touch tool? Can't seem to get anything to display.

Yeah but if it's going through your servers, our devices must make a connection to your server, thereby revealing our IP addresses. I find it hard to believe someone who has developed an application doesn't know this.

In my opinion, yes my IP is sensitive data when it is potentially linked to all of my trading history. You can use an IP address to get a lot of information about an individual.

Bitpay has done some stupid shit, don't get me wrong, but they have been instrumental in helping drive bitcoin adoption by offering automatic settlement to fiat for mosts businesses who can't afford the volatility of Bitcoin. It doesn't appear as if BTCPayServer does this, and I'm not really sure how they would even if they wanted to without going through a 3rd party.

It's not a bad idea, but the only issue is that there a ton of applications that do very similar things that already exist - you'll have to do something new and unique. Other pro tip: I would recommend using something like the coinmarketcap if you are just doing data entry, then you never need any API keys to be configured by the end user.

This is a good question. Ideally since it looks like you are entering a read only API key, that data wouldn’t need to touch their servers.

I think more people are taking it and will continue to because of inflation. Imagine living in a place where Bitcoin is more stable than a government backed currency.

While also at the same time contributing different BIPs to Bitcoin and growing the ecosystem by allowing merchants to auto convert to USD in the most end user friendly way. Jesus Christ I swear to god everyone on BOTH this sub and the other BTC sub are worse than partisan politicians sometimes. Not everything has to be black and white.
Let the downvotes roll!

So will you open source the application so that can be verified by a 3rd party or compiled from source? The best part about crypto is not having to trust a 3rd party, which you are asking us to do.

HE SAID LN!!!!! /s

Performing a couple API calls and parsing the returned data, especially or what you want to do should not be that processor or bandwidth intensive.

You're such a douche lol.
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:18:43
Do you have proof of this? Hard, factual proof?

Lightning isn't a privacy network and not all transactions will ever be on that layer.

It's pretty close to that already - you just need to know your friends email, not even crypto address to send money in coinbase to them.
