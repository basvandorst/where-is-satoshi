Seems legit. I would seriously not want to be the 5-year old you explain things to. This is neither informative nor impartial. Every top altcoin has it's strengths and weaknesses; there's a reason they have market caps worth tens of millions and fiat trading.

You're not working at all. If you're under the impression that we "pay" people for legitimate work in 10 doge tips, you're severely mistaken. People make wonderful comments every day and get paid nothing; maybe reddit gold if they're lucky. Tipping on Reddit is a small reward where you would usually get nothing, not payment for your really sought-after services of making what are usually shitty posts. If I actually want to buy something, I'll pay you some thousands/tens of thousands of doge to do a job or buy an item (there are several sites where you can do this, reply if you'd like a list).

That was a direct donation, not sent through a tipbot on a public forum, which shows the value of *tipping* with the currency.

Can I get 100BTC?

Well, the way I see it, the tipping infrastructure made that 11,000$ tip possible. While Mr. Ver directly sent the bitcoin, used a tipping bot commonly used on twitter all the time. This demonstrates both trust and stability in the use of the tipbot, as opposed to confidence in private transactions.

There's a difference (at least to me) in that Roger Ver used the bitcoin wallet to directly send the BTC, while demostrated stability of and trust in the tipbot infrastructure. Also, in respect to your top-level post, it is very easy to spend doge: [Link]( [Link]( [Link]( [Link]( [Link]( If you can't find anything you like there, I can find even more places in only 5 minute's time.

We're all very grateful, believe me. Keep on doing what you're doing!

"ELI5" is not "GABTAD"; Give a biased tirade against dogecoin.

You're not getting paid to make comments on reddit, pretty much ever. We're not insulting a service you provide, just letting you know we appreciate something you usually do for free.
