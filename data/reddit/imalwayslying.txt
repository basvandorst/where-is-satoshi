" If the average confirmation time goes to 20 minutes"
Wouldn't difficulty adjustments prevent this from happening?

You might feel bad now because of lost profit, but at least you guys got to experience BTC and I assure you it was worth it.
Me on the other hand, I first heard about bitcoins in mid 2009. I thought it was fascinating, but did nothing. Then I kept coming back to it, continued to think they were a fascinating topic, but kept doing nothing to get some myself. At the time it was not that easy to buy bitcoins in europe as far as I remember, but I guess it wouldnt take that much time to mine some of them.
Soon after 1 BTC was around 0.1$ and it there were several ways to get them without too much effort.
Nowadays I feel really frustrated for not having followed my gut instinct that bitcoins would continue to get more and more valuable

bitcoin.de worked well for me, but the verification process takes a few days, or even up to a week in some cases.

Unless you've done that 1 year ago :)

if you believe in bitcoin use it to pay for services and goods. That's is all that's left to prove its a real currency and convince more merchants to adopt it

Let's say they would spend 1 000 000 000 US dollars. The most powerful ASIC miner that I know of is from cointerra. It throws 2Thps and costs 6kUSD. 1 Billion dollars of those would get you 166666 of such devices. All of those combined would produce over 300 000 Thps of computational power !!! 
BTC guild, is largest pool at the moment [1] and is currently at aproximately 1200 Thps [2]. They are closely followed by GHash, I couldn't find their stats, but it looks like they are at similar rates.
So with over 200 times the computing power, they would probably have a good chance of causing problems

This is not true. All modern AV solutions from reputable vendors have behavioral analysis (what is the code trying to do) and reputation scores (how often has this application been seen on other users). Reputation databases help immensely with metamorphic virus that keep changing their signature on each infection.

has a point. If I borrowed 1 BTC last year at the rate of 100$ and had to pay it back today at the rate of 1000$ how would I do that? The only way this can work in the future is if a market get's mature enough so that you can conduct a business (invest BTC and end up with more BTC that you started with) without ever having to convert it to another fiat currency

Reviving old topic :) Did you get this problem sorted?

and do not loose the paper to a fire!

That is exactly what I meant.
If you have a business model that allows you to borrow BTC and make a profit without having to convert them into another fiat currency then you're good to go.
With the growing adoption of bitcoins I can only assume this will be getting more and more common, but at this time it is still a hard task to accomplish.

I fully agree with backups and other preventive measures (you are never too safe), I only disagreed with gigitrix view that AV software only helps with what is known in signatures.
