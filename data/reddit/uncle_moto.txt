I am very much a noob, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.  But, I just went on coinbase.com, created my account, then downloaded the app on my phone (coinbase) and bought some. Now I stare at my phone all day refreshing prices, haha.

I dunno, I googled it. It said there was about 2 trillion in 1990, 4 trillion in 2008, and about 5 trillion now.  I think "currency" is what could be argued here.  I don't know......  I fix robots for a living, I google everything else.

Oh yeah, definitely considering it.  Once I actually educate myself some more, I may set up a thingy-ma-bob to buy so much per paycheck.  I'm on the fence about getting more at the moment. Honestly, I'm looking at other digital currency much harder at the moment.

This was also me last night.  Broke down and bought my first Bitcoin after I just couldn't take seeing you guys post the "It's over 9k!!!" stuff while I was sitting here literally for years saying "maybe I should buy some?".   I've spent the entire day doing nothing but checking price, researching what everyone else is speculating, etc.....

I think that's exactly the point.  It's what it makes him feel like. I just bought my first last night, and I feel like Michael Douglas right now.... even though we all know damn well that dog could outperform me at this point.

You had me curious how much 1 bitcoin would be worth if it really did reach 1% of the world's currency.  As of now, there is about 5 trillion in worldwide currency.  Take 1% of that and divide that by 21 million bitcoin, and you get about $2,380 per bitcoin after all are mined.
I'm sure there are tons of other factors I don't even know I should be putting in to this, but that's the basics, I guess.

It was a few minutes, if I remember right.  If that.

Oh shit, you can see the future! neato.

It came from google.  I typed in "how much currency is in the world" and this seemed to be the agreed upon figure.  If you start adding in investments and other assets, you start getting up into the hundreds of trillions....

OK, but to be fair, it's been at "all-time high" for a long time.  You could have written this EXACT SAME post any just about any time in the last several years with a few exceptions. You may be right, it may pop and what I bought is worth a fraction of what I got it for.  It could go to $100,000 and I sell off (then maybe even regret that)...  but I'm mentally prepared either way.  I didn't mortgage my house to buy $100,000 worth or anything... just enough to be in just in case it does go to some astronomical amount. If I lose it all or most of it.... *shrug* so is life, I know the risks.
With all that said...  condescendingly coming at me the way you did like I'm a fucking idiot and you're here to show me how dumb it was for me to buy it is really not a good look man.  Work on that a little...

With a few seconds of.... "well, damn" and then go back to watching football.  Honestly, I looked at this more as gambling than investing.  I only put in what I could afford to lose.
