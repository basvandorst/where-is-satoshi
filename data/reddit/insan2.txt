Database hacking is a big thing right now.
All sort off databases world wide are hacked every day.for identity thieft damage they can do is mostly not that big.
The data that's leaked every day is so big so a scenario where they steal your identity is small because they have a highly amount of data to make a choice from.
But if it says you own millions worth of bitcoin be sure you will become a target if it falls in to wrong hands.

Same here.
Thats why I questioned if this is everywhere.
Our gouverment causes severe tax inflation they don't have control over money supply so maybe was the cased by tax inflation.
Only problem even with more taxes they create more debt.
So the round goes all over again.
Only problem here is they will not change how there system works and have the most politicians/citizens ratio in europe.
Couple weeks ago there was leaked documents a lot of them have income greater then angela merkel or the president of US while it also is a small country in europe.
And We still have to fund a whole royal family with even greater income.
Keeps running in circles more debt and more taxes.
Even we already had the reputation as Europe's highes taxed country.
This situation wasn't always like this.
That's why maybe it's just tax inflation.
It isn't a third world country so it's not that terrible here as long this situation doesn't continue like this.

That's crap.It's not forcing everything offchain.and payment channels aren't going to make bitcoin centralized.
Bitcoins technology is out dated and limited.
in second layer it can evolve to do all things new competitors can do.
It isn't forcing everything offchain.new functions and uses can be build second layer so more is possible with bitcoin and evolve s with competitors and time.else every time something new comes the whole onchain protocol needs to be adjusted and eventually while be flooded by new functions and risking new security issues.
You see it as replace onchain to second layer.
But it realy is you have onchain and new functions can be created next to it when the technology evolves.to make bitcoin capable of more.
@_date: 2017-02-15 21:05:31
So second layer solutions can be a rescue.
Bitcoin is to transparent.
If this scenario is the case it will be easy to arrest all non regulated bitcoin users.
A second layer solution can give whole new possibilities to privacy functions.

Who says in the future they increase it every time.It's a fix temporary easy in code to don't expose security by something complex fast written untested code.
Don't know if this is the plan.
but gives time for further creating and evaluating and testing code to handle it properly next.
This civil war is all about the order of when things happen.
It isn't that they do something first and the rest next it's not gonna happen and over think the order paranoid with conspiracies.
The point that in mass adoption increasing block size isn't enough.so making space more efficient and fix code for second layer solutions so technology can evolve isn't a bad step.
And next start on the block size.
@_date: 2017-02-12 19:23:46
5 dollar is definitely not worth cold storage.
On most online phone wallets the keys are encrypted stored so there is a protected layer
Perfectly secure enough for everyday use funds.
But for cold storage remember that when the seed or privatekey is imported in online device it isn't cold any more.
Also always encrypt backups.
For offline signing use a app like bither.
Use hd wallets and not reuse address wallets.
Address reuse is still insecure even done cold.
If the signature isn't made secure it is easly cracked to reverse engineer the private key.
If the signature is made secure at this time it is hard to attack but cant guaranty this will also be the case in the future.
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:11:38
I agree the blocksize must increase.
I didn't say segwit first.
Both are needed don't care in what order they come.
It is just the drama against segwit I don't understand.when bitcoin gets more crowded or second layers give all sort of new uses to bitcoin it is necessary blocks are efficient as possible.
New uses second layer can give or more main stream adoption is gonna fill blocks to quickly that even with segwit the space isn't enough.bitcoins technology is limited all new things a competiter makes possible can be created second layer on bitcoin.the more the technology can handle when bigger blocks getting to big the better.else its gonna be replaced quicker by newer future technology.
BU supporters conspiracies are nonce and are stopping bitcoins growth.I have nothing against BU but  find cores code better quality .
Not hard coded block size is great but find BU approach to risky.there has to be a better way.don't know how maybe something created like the difficulty works.
@_date: 2017-02-25 05:51:17
I don't understand the BU crap.
Core eventually is gonna increase the blocksize even with segwit.
Why block second layer solutions?
It's not like everything is going to happen off chain.
But it creates new possibilities what bitcoin can do.
Perfect for making it better for merchants.
And systems for smart contracts.
Second layer solutions can make what is possible with bitcoin enormous.
This never will be possible with just a blocksize increase.
Sure blocksize must increase but why be against what second layer solutions can give

What online wallet do you use?
Yes it happened many times in the past.
 if you use coinbase as wallet they are insured for los.
But still is a third-party so you need to trust them.
If you choose a online wallet provider always set a 2fa   login.like google authenticator app on your phone this protects against all keyloggers and most malware.
If the wallet is linked to your email.set a 2fa login on this to prevent an attacker to request a new password for the online wallet service.
And choose a online wallet service that is insured or one that uses multi signature so they don't hold all the keys.
Better choice mange your fund yourself.
If it's a decent amount in bitcoin and your not that technical 
Option 1:
get a trezor or ledger nano.
Simple and perfectly secure.
But write down the seed in case you lose your wallet or it breaks so you can recover funds elsewhere
Option 2: (are capable of working with devices)
If hardware wallet is to expansive a  option for storing big funds learn how to make paper wallet from a aircapped pc(never goes connected to the internet) or burn a linux live dvd and learn how to boot it and how you can use it for generating a paper wallets.make sure you always have backups 
If you have a old smartphone(never internet) it can also be used for generating cold wallets.for downloading a wallet app it can be connected to internet once but after that never again.apps on Android capible of this mycelium or bither.iPhone I don't know.
Make sure you have backups duplicates of the private key or seed.these are need to import when funds are needed to a online device (hot wallet).or u lose the original.
For every day use funds a mobile wallet is secure enough.but encrypt it with a password.and write done the recover seed or backup the keeys so you can recover funds.
It isn't perfectly sure.but highly unlikely to get hacked or malware to steal funds because every app runs sandboxed.
Pc wallets on Windows are highly insecure.
Never leave more funds than you need on them.
@_date: 2017-02-12 04:46:35
No only seed is needed everyone that has the seed can access the coins.
The pin is a small protection after seed is imported for the device itself.and won't be asked after importing elsewhere.

In all the years of bitcoins existence 3 of 4 exchanges where hacked or the owner run of with the funds.
Bitcoin has come a far way.

Even better learn to be your own bank.

Have to diversify.
Only problem here is allot taxes the whole amount gets taxed+broker fees when jou buy and sell even if you lose.
And winnings are taxed afterward 2 times.
And losses can't be subtracted from winnings.
They need to be local or there is a other tax.
And the dollar is high against the euro.
If it falls the costs of the correction and exchangerate and exchange tax makes stocks risky.
So have to explore if it can be profitable.
Gold is a option.fully tax free.
Bitcoin lucky not regulated and taxfree if lawyer is put on the case.

People value it for its decentralisation and immunity.
So it has use.
If you can't do transactions and can't use the technology it doesn't have value.
It will just be a token.
Future will give it more use.
Once sidechains kick off people will keep finding new ways to use the technology.
Rootstock,lighting,... are one of these interesting projects.
When this kicks off it will have the potential to charge the world.

Phone works perfect.
Just as long it stays a offline device.
Seeds and private keys are easly backuped on paper or sd card.
Phone is easy to carry and beats to effort it takes on pc's.
In Android you also have the app bither that works perfect for offline signing to a online Android device.to bad they stop supporting multi signature.

It isn't krakens fault.but I agree they have to help your friend with all the documentation and steps to put it on cloudflare.
But are you sure it is caused by the cloudbleed bug?
Maybe malware,keylogger,clone spoofing website.
The amount leaked by to bug was a small percentage.
If security wasn't setup all on the same time frame or with email verification it is statistically impossible to have enough data even when  a part was leaked.
I'm sure kraken support will help your friend.

There is no use for a company like rolex to do this.a database is better choice.
It has no place if there is one owner.
If the network isn't a large amount of participants it is pointless.
a blockchain porpese is for creating trust between a network of large amount of peers that is decentralized in nature.
Even for a large network of companys blockchain is a bad choice.
Its written for network of strangers.
For a private network improving the database model has better use.
Creating a distributed ledger database would look very different than a blockchain.
And while be easier to code with database as bases as bitcoins blockchain as bases.

This implies if you are service provider.

A lighting hub doesn't give you control over its users funds.
It's build decentralized.
So if you as a company proces user funds yes it is regulated.

If a was a money laundering guy bitcoin is the last thing I would use.
Sure there are people that use it to launder money but all money is.
But its hyped by the media for criminal use.
In reality its transparency and the over belief it is bitcoin only use makes explaining unexplainable wealth extreme hard.
Every legit user already becomes a suspect if he is a little wealthy.
Other systems like banking are much more preferable.
You aren't a suspect from the start so if you keep it that way and handle it well as long you aren't put under serious investigation you have better odds on success.
Bitcoin is probably the worsed system to commit money laundering in.
And other criminal uses are going to happen in the near future in less transparent currency like monero or zcash.
All forms of money eventually are used by criminals bitcoin is no exception.
But how bitcoin is build it is extreem hard and leaves extreme amounts of traces backs for even most experienced tech guys to not fuck up.
and law enforcement are getting better in investing bitcoins blockchain.
So criminals using bitcoin be warned u are gonna get caught so quickly!

Proof of work is bitcoin model.
There are also models as proof of stake and many others.
The private blockchains still need to prove them self.
I don't believe the hype blockchain in the commercial sector.
Blockchain was written for a immune decentralized network.
Making a network of peers do the same thing  as a centralized place takes much more effort even without proof of work and removing immunity makes it totally a waist of time and effort.and the code is written with decentralized network in mind.
Blockchain has its pro's and con's and database has its pro's and con's.
What I have seen so far in effort in the private sector on implementing blockchain they adjusted a blockchain more like a database and ending up with a hybrid with blockchain and database con's without the pro's.
Immunity is a must in a blockchain.
There will be small uses in the private sector but for most uses blockchain is hyped.
And see more success in improving/adjusting there database model then trying editing a blockchain model.

Now it's still different by country in EU.

Problem is technology is evolving so even when it is regulated regulation can't follow.
Probably they have nothing on lightinghubs
Because its new.
Aml/kyc is impossible.
Like someone suggesting it can be done with a firewall that is also true for nodes or miners.but in a p2p network it doesn't matter if one blocks because you can't force everyone.

Once the scaling issue is handled and lighting becomes possible these features are still small thinking.
Bitcoin can evolve to something so much bigger than what people can imagine.
Bitcoins blockchain technology is soon going to be outdated.
Altcoins keep finding new innovative ways and features and expand the technology.
It is impossible by bitcoins immunity to adept   this to bitcoins protocol onchain and is not secure.
But what makes lighting possible makes so much more possible.
To create every new innovations an alt comes up with buildin in something like lighting.
So bitcoin main protocol doesn't need to change every time technology evolves.
Onchain transactions aren't going to disappear.they will still be possible.
But micro payments,smartcontracts,privacy and so much more will be possible.
Imagine full programmable money.
Full automated services that are decentralized doing all the tasks you now adays use corporations for.
Or centralized to bring automation to a whole new level and cut costs everywhere.
and will make ethereum look like a joke as the big spam database it is.

Nobody said this is not gonna happen in the future.only takes time developing/reviewing best methods.
Isn't like core is not preparing to build something for this.
Latest release does have pruning functions.
Internet speed further evolves.
Fixing code for side ways solutions isn't a bad thing.
Creates room to create new things in the future.

Found the reason.
I suspect this is no attempt for regulation.
every exchange already has to
Know there customer aml/kml.
Bitcoin is as transparent as fuck.
And law agency all over the world already over analyze the blockchain  for criminals.
Every coin where they find criminal activity.
Can back to an exchange.all IP address. Are all logged in these law agency's. Or the VPN service that has the original IP.and TOR these days is not untraceable as it was in the past.
So criminal  have it hard these days. And are easily traced.
How it works today if they find criminal activity. This gives a cause for getting court order.for the exchange give identity, or the VPN or proxy server the user it's IP.
This new system gives no more benefits getting all data to exposure criminals.
But it only gives data of all information of the fair users.
Why do they need that?could it be so they have a full list of every EU citizens. Attack all user with all sort of regulations to give the bitcoin user  a tough time,restrict the use of parts of the network make it illegal ,.. I begin to suspect this.   
Why? Look at this: 
defines “custodian wallet provider” as an entity providing services to safeguard cryptographic keys on behalf of customers, to holding, storing and transferring virtual currencies.
Under the new proposal, member states are required to ensure that exchange services between virtual currencies and fiat currencies, and custodian providers.
Every wallet they call  a  custodian wallet??????
Every bitcoin prepaid provider have to be registered with there database?????
So they  can confiscate funds from terrorist.
They probably gonna force every bitcoin user ones registered in there database.
Use a 3d Parry (custdodian).wallet.
They talk that there needs to be a way to confiscate founds from terrorist and criminals.
I don't trust this shit.
They have the power to make its dectralized use a crime.
Every bitcoin user that drops off than a suspect for the crime using bitcoin decentralized. And in there database
So they can confiscate.
Or if there economy gets a big recession.
You can't flee out there economy to bitcoin decentralized.
So they can protect there economy from the cash outflow as damage control.

If the phone is only used for offline signing
And never connects to internet again
 it is secure enough.
But when phone is stolen it can easily be cracked.do full disk encryption and maybe a encyted vault app/app data locker.

It's hard to do something wrong.the only thing that can happen is you break your trezor without a backup.
Why don't practice a little like this to get basic understanding how bitcoin works:
* get a bitcoin wallet on your phone to practice with pocket money receiveing/sending
Send it between your phone and coinbase.
Copy the text the phone gives in the QR code.
*Go to the site  .
Enter the same address you sent/withdraw in the searchbar.
This site shows the progress for every transaction you ever make.
When the site says you have 1 or more conformation s the funds are spendable.
If you get comfortable with this next.:
*YouTube paperwallet.
*Make a brainwallet ( this is with a word seed).
And. You learn about what the private address is and a seed.
*try send Small amounts to the paper wallet  and withdraw them back to your phone.
Do this again sometimes only with the private key and sometimes recreate the private key with your seed.
*try to see now if you understand the difference  between public key and private key and how to restore a private key with your word seed(backup skill/knowledge)
You now have learned the basics how the system works and have knowledge :
-how block chain explorer works.
-what a public key and privatekey is.
- how to backup/restore your address (private key/word seed)
Try this just with small amounts the first times to be safe.
This is basic knowledge and understanding how bitcoin works.
Future problems are now simple/easy with google /YouTube.
Now you can easly figure out yourself how to backup every hot wallet and cold storage device in the future
IMPORTANT inform yourself next on these:
-Google/YouTube over cold wallet/storage -hot wallet/storage.
So you understand how you keep your funds/backups safe ( cold storage).
And see/have the skills  how you best create and keepsafe the seed/private key for all your addresses/devices(never toughed the internet).
Now you have basic knowledge of security.
So it's easy  to keep your funds safe any time in the future.
 And will never make a mistake yourself  to  lose your funds  anytime in the future.
or be a subjected to theft.
Figuring out trezor now is very simple.

Not beter to first identify every bitcoin service in the blockchain that at least processes atleast a decent amount transactions and try creating a voting systems between them like sign a message with key or email and broadcast public.
So every service and user or miner can see and verify if other services support it ,support it only if there is an majority that will support it,will join sides if one gets major majority,... or for signings an  agreement they all will run it if it gets a number of supporters and will join combined.
Just don't like the risk of a messy coin split.
Like your idea but this is never been done before so there can only be guesses about potential outcomes.

But besides the positive it maybe even can some day mean the end of bitcoin because it restricts innovation and the capabilities to evolve.

I think the golds day's are over.
Also the risk of tungsten hidden in bars.
If you invest in bitcoin make it not all your capital.
The technology is old the reason it is where it is today is solely because of the network effect it stands above everything else.
If it can't evolve it will be dead and a competitor will take over.
With segwit I still believe in it.
Otherwise we need to find a other solution for offchain innovation.
We will see what the future holds.
Sha256(sha256) will hold but elliptic curve will somewhere become a problem.
Luckily this isn't a issue as long address aren't reused.

It is easy for filling your head with FUD stories if  you don't know anything about it.
Before I got in to bitcoin I thought exactly the same.
All the media a couple years back on silkroad didn't do good.
Potential anonymous is still misleading.
Using it if someone is watching and know how to collect and put all data together it's impossible to be anonymous.

He sends a transaction with a low fee to you.
When the transaction is broadcasted you see it as incoming.
If the transactions isn't picked up in a block yet he can send the same transaction to himself with a higher fee.
As you can't send more coins than you have only 1 transaction gets accepted by the network.
To avoid this wait a couple confirmations or if you see a double spend in the mempool bump the fee yourself.

Bitaddress is ok.
You can download it and put it on a usb stick to run on a offline machine.
Import the key to a wallet so you can send it.
If you dont trust the wallet because its connected to the internet and don't want the expose your private key
you can sign the transaction offline with electrum offline or something like  downloaded version.
Transactions once signed can not be altered.
So you can broadcast it with almost every wallet that's connected to the internet with out exposing the key to an online machine.

The network can only handle 7 transactions a second.the miners fill the blocks with the highest fees.

Even if you use hd wallets the addresses change but the coins are still linked to the service and come together at some point or part off it.and on that point you can backtrack them.and if they get to an exchange they have your aml/kyc info maybe they communicate with other exchanges.
a mixer can make a trail a little more difficult.
Also mycelium spv server can be an identifier.
Connecting to random nodes to broadcast the transactions can probably also help.
Difficult to say the blockchain leaves such a large trail there are enormous possible ways to link identities to coins.

Yes with the privatekey you can restore your funds in every wallet.
Be sure you got the right private key.
Wallets can create multiple ones.
You can try to make your public key with it and use a blockchain explorer to see if it hold s the funds.
Public keys can be exposed nothing anyone else can do with it.
Private keys you need to hold secure for yourself.

When you sweep the wallet to your personal the owner is known.
Probably a couple fake costumers to see where the coins or part of the coins come together.
These coins are then linked to your service.
If you have this you can also make a pattern how the owner broadcast transactions(node,ip,vpn,tor,time).
If some of your coins come to getter with these and probably some other patterns made with your service they can pretty much isolate it.
That's what I think.

14 btc.
There are 3 addresses.
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:55:04
The offline created public key is a valid address to send to.you don't need to do anything with it.
Every possible address it creates is a valid address.
U can use a blockchain explorer like  to see it has no transactions in it(by entering the pub key in the search bar) not necessary but you will see it is a valid address.
Once a transaction is made the history will be recorded in the blockchain.
If you enter the address again in the search bar you see the address now has a history.
Once the transaction shows over 1 confirmation its recorded forever in the blockchain.
If you want to move the funds you have to import the private key to any wallet software(risk if machine is comprised).
Or create a signed transaction offline with a airgapped machine  and broadcast this with any wallet software(safe even if online machine is comprised).

Always use 2fa.

@_date: 2017-05-25 21:06:32
If you are capable of doing cold storage you don't need a hardware wallet.
Airgaped machines or a securely made paper wallet are sometimes to difficult or to much effort for users.
Paper wallets are perfectly secure if it was not made on a online device and not exposed to a online device.
Network printers still have cache.
But encrypting the key or using a old printer can protect against this.
With storing on usb data can get corrupt so make sure you have more backups.
With hardware wallets you get a seed you write down that's created by the device so if the hardware fails you can restore your funds elsewhere.

Android is sandboxed the data where google authenticator stores the info can only get accessed with root privileges.
If a malicious app uses a exploit to gain root access it is capable stealing this data.
Encrypting storage doesn't protect against this.
Don't install apps from outside the google playstore and you will be fine in most cases.
Also never root a device yourself that you use for bitcoin activities or email.
If you really want to be secure use a old phone that never connects to the internet solely for the g auth app.
