The only problem with the Bitcoin is the annoyingly long addresses.
I know QR codes can work but QR codes can be a pain at times.

Except it's not anonymous or decentralized.

This is the technology; that's the application.

I'm not doing this. I just posted the link.

You forgot to change the confirmation number to make it look more legit.

I was just thinking.
Maybe something like namecoin but for Bitcoin addresses? That'd be a cool idea.

Don't you need a bank account to buy bitcoins most of the time?

Grooveshark is a great freebie, but there's so many better services out there.
The only real good thing about Grooveshark is the 'broadcasts' thing IMHO.
It's unorganized; a clutter of half-complete albums, incorrectly tagged music, low quality stuff too.
Heck, it's barely legal as well; you have to jailbreak your iPhone/iPad if you have one just to download the app.
Deezer in the UK is the best free service I've found. With adblock there's no ads whatsoever either. Premium is nice too (I got 3 months for a quid). Works in a browser and the droid app is nice too.
Spotify of course is great.
Then there's Rd.io.
Hopefully those services start accepting it as well.

Same guy. I'm guessing he used the web inspector/inspect element pane and used that to manipulate the DOM instead of Photoshop.

[Well, that was easy.](

More than likely very high. I think NASA have created some sort of system for dealing with it though.

Peh, thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2014-07-12 17:50:28
Wow! Thanks :D

Doesn't this sort of void the idea of Bitcoin? It may as well be PayPal.

I bought a Blackberry 9870 for like £30 on eBay second hand. Not great quality but the phone works a charm (Had to buy a new battery for like £3 though).
Bought a QI wireless charging kit for a fiver as well and saves me breaking the microUSB on it.
They have quite good sound quality + it's nice and loud.
Now I have a job I will probably go ahead and buy myself a decent Android soon, but it's still not a bad phone.
