Of course they won't sell in 1 piece, maybe the government or institutions are buying with 1000 different addresses. Be critical, i think maybe all this is happening before the government steps in, or make one controlled by them. Bitcoin can be crashed in minutes if they decide so. What is 100 billion dollars for them? They are printing that in 1 day.

New 'marketing' make it limited and people will buy it.

Depends on 1. Total supply of coins 2. Potential. 3. Community and so on. You can't give a conclusion based on this information you give.

Yeah Europe is collapsing, "let's buy some crypto what we never heard of". Sounds logic? I don't think so. In times of collapsing you gonna trade water for food etc. Who want a cryptocurrency that they even can't touch?

There is much uncertainity about btc atm. I don't know how people will treat this.

Maybe the exchanges, but I don't think the elite won't let it happen to give the power back to the people. I think this digital technology will disrupt our privacy. You know that the elite want a world currency that is powered by them. You then can control everything easier.  We need to get the bigger picture here.

The total supply of a coin x the price is the market cap of a coin. The total market cap is the sum. I was also in BTC since 2010-2011.

Exactly this. I think we are getting in a bubble. It is just becoming a mania. I suggest everyone to read the aspects of a bubble and be aware of this. The rise of the prices are due to the rise of the market cap. But I think many people don't even know the principles of the blockchain at all.

This is probably happening right now. Yesterday the total marketcap rose 4 billion dollars in 1 hour. We can't know who is buying this. Only we know is the adress who got it. The government can buy 50 to 100 billion dollars in hours and after that dump it. This could all happen.

21 august segwit activate we'll see.
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:23:16
Yes you are right with the supply and demand. With the market cap I was talking about the total market cap.

Can anyone explain me why crypto's will rise if there is uncertainity in the stock market? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:19:46
The investment funds saw this as an oportunity, which had a snowball effect for the other people.

Yes, i know that. But the possible fork will only affect btc and not the alts if you dont look at the price?
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:26:40
There will be no consequences for the alts right?
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:49:46
Again, im not asking about the price. Im asking about the altcoin itself, does it have any risks of dissapearing or so.
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:59:06
Will it affect the altcoins too if those are stored in exchanges? Other than the price? Like losing them.
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:30:51
You could benefit of a rough 10 percent rise by then.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:46:09
Its logic when the price drops everyone knows its about time to reach the same level. So smart people buy in the dips and the holders wont affect anything.
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:49:28
Is there also a risk of holding altcoins? I mean not the decrease of value but more of losing it.
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:18:50
You only lose when you sell.
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:21:08
I know that you carry risk if you hold it on an exchange, but I read sometimes that coins get stuck in the transaction. What do you recommend? I know trezor but you cant hold all the altcoins in there.
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:46:15
Will altcoins be safe on exchanges after 1 august?
