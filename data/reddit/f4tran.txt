Interesting theory. I personally think it's some nerds with an opinion and nothing better to do.

Occam's razor says the simplest explanation is probably true. "Something happened by chance" is way simpler than "someone rigged SHA-256 from the beginning so that it would produce these hashes today."

That's because it's *very obvious* that bcash is a subversive campaign. They already had a sub and already had a name, then users with a history of opposing block size increases created a different sub and stickied it to this subreddit, a place where altcoin discussion is supposedly banned, in a post full of derogatory language that explains how the altcoin called bcash, that altcoin, is just an altcoin and nothing more than an altcoin, and did I mention it's just an altcoin that's only an altcoin.
That kind of psychological warfare is very childish and only makes us look stupid. Let the new coin die on it's own; we don't need to pull dirty tricks.

 So let me ask you something: what if there were an integer overflow bug, and your account on an exchange suddenly showed a balance of $2,147,483,647.
Do you think they should be required to give you the two billion dollars?
It was a technical glitch, an error that caused the system to claim a trade had taken place when it had not. The absurdly high exchange rate made clear to anyone that the trade was not intentional. It would be a cruel and scary world, if you could lose your life savings and go out of business because you typed one line of code incorrectly.

I know. The name itself didn't originate  maliciously. But the subreddit r/bcash obviously did. And the language in the sticky is very loaded.
