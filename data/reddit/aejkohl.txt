Both you and are confusing "Greece" with "The Greek Government". You're making the assumption that the government's problems are the greek society's problems, and that the greek government solving its issues would be good good for Greek people. Much to the contrary, what is good for the Greek government would be fatal to many Greek people, and whatever is bad for the state machinery will only serve to set the Greek people free.
They must take the monetary power away from government (both EU and Greek) and let the Greek State rot and perish. If their choice is to either leave it in the hands of the EU or give it to the Greek government, then this is just a choice of who will rob and massacre them (the EU through bail-ins or the Greek State through hyperinflation).

That is why we need a plethora of competing certification companies. 3 or 4 isn't enough (as shown by the mining scandals, specifically BFL as you said). 
Bitcoin services are risky as hell right now we simply don't have enough people offering them (which itself probably stems from a lack of real demand). As the bitcoin economy grows, it will be increasingly difficult to run scam after scam, until it eventually becomes practically impossible. How feasible do you think it would be to run a successful certification company that isn't completely transparent, when 10 other such companies are transparent and backed by clearly real identities?
An exchange going the way of Mt. Gox (at least on such a blatant level) is already considered fairly unlikely. Why? Because we have a ton more exchanges now than we did back then.
Competition leads to perfection. Lack of competition results in risky environments.

When the state decides to regulate something, it gives itself a monopoly on this regulation. 
What the Bitcoin space needs is a plethora of competing regulators, we will soon see which of them have the most valuable/trusted certifications, and then it will be considered foolish to trade on uncertified exchanges. 
We need governing bodies, just not a single one that boasts a violently enforced monopoly.

Bitcoin will solve Greece's problems. Of course it won't solve the Greek government's problems, but you know what? That is good news.
You really think making labour cheaper and dinsincentivising saving will help the average greek worker? This only helps the rich and the politicians (two quite converging classes). You're advocating that the Greek people get raped by the Greek government rather than by the EU.
Bail-ins are deadly, but inflation is just as lethal. Murder is not the answer.

How is that different to when the government certifies/regulates a shady company? I'll tell you how: The government doesn't go out of business after such a mistake. A "trusted certification company" could only "cash in" once, and then the people running this company will never be trusted again. They have a much higher incentive to be very conservative on who they back, because that's the only way they can keep in business for a long time and actually keep on making money. The government doesn't need to be this conservative, because they will still have their monopoly no matter how many times they screw up.

In addition to all of my previous replies to you, let me address the notion that *"they are private monopolies"*which is mentioned in this quote. As far as I (and most anarcho-capitalists as well as a good portion of libertarians) am concerned, private monopolies are only possible thanks to government, and in this way, they act as a de facto extension, or "agency" of the government. They are no different to United States Government institutions aside from the fact that they do not refer to themselves as such.

"*independent entity within government*" : saying that this somehow isn't equal to the term "*government agency*" is nothing else than wordplay and doublespeak to be honest, and I'm saying this as a European who isn't overly familiar with US terminology, so maybe you can work out how I came to interpret the functions of your federal reserve as that of an "agency" (*noun; a business or organization established to provide a particular service*) within the government.

US Federal Reserve is not a good example of separation of money and state. It is a State monopoly. The reason we know this is that it would be illegal to try to compete with it.

Indeed, that is the only thing we disagree on, semantics. There is no clear etymological reason why government should mean the authority to tax, which is why I have allowed myself the freedom to define/call a *private security firm funded by voluntary trade* as a **type** of government, the main other type being a State.  
I think we can reach out to statists much more effectively by appealing to anti-monopoly feelings (which even the most progressive of democrats holds very dearly), and separating the concepts of state and government in this way. Even those who are most attached to government can then repudiate the state as the coercive monopoly that it is.
Part of my inspiration for this was Sovereign Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein's book, *The State in the Third Millenium*. Hans-Adam II shows how even a monarch from a multi-centennial reigning family can be anti-state. He does not get any revenue from the State or from taxation. He envisions himself as an entrepreneur, he feels as though the state has taken too much responsibility and power, and that it should be reduced to a form of government that is not a coercive monopoly over a geographical area, and instead has to compete with other governments to provide a service which "citizens" actually want to acquire.
In 2003 he attempted to amend the constitution to give every single citizen the right of individual, private secession (the separation of yourself and your private property from the state). You can read more about it in my article on liberty.me :

A non-statist government, or a non-monopoly government, as I described it, becomes nothing more than a sort of insurance company in a system of polycentric law, as such: 
As to how I define the service of governance: The provision and enforcement of law. Nobody should be forced to hire/have a government, just like nobody should be forced to wear shoes or have a car, but the advantages of having these things would outweigh the disadvantages to an extent that almost everybody in what we loosely define as "society" will either have them or aspire to have them.
@_date: 2015-07-16 17:15:53
As an anarchist libertarian this is where I draw the distinction between State and Government. These words are often used synonymously but to me a government is just a company that offers the service of governance, a service which happens to be in high demand in society right now. 
A state is a government that enforces a monopoly, in other words, employs violence to stop significant competition from emerging. A State does all it can, even enslave its customers and send them to war, in order to stop another government (whether it is a statist government or not) from getting customers that are within its specified geographical area of service. So all states are governments, but a government is not necessarily a state. 
I am anti-state, not anti-government. Monopolies are bad, no matter whether it is in the industry of car manufacturing or in governance, it is all as inefficient and harmful to innovation. Competition in governance will be as beautiful as it is inevitable. All monopolies fall eventually.. Am I right, ?

This is the truth right there. Sure, it takes a certain (minimal) degree of technical skill to download Skype from the internet, but would anyone really buy a "Skype-Box" that does nothing else than provide access to a regular Skype client when the box is plugged in to a regular computer? Even if the "Skype-Box" came with an automatic generation of a few cents of Skype credits per day (costing more in electricity than the amount of Skype credits generated).
No, when smart contracts become important enough, the software will come pre-installed on many computers, just like Skype is today on most Windows installations, and it will be easily downloadable and usable on other machines. And by then, buying a small amount of "smart contract credits" (millibits of BTC) will be as easy as buying a small amount Skype credits. 
To think that this issue of software adoption can be solved by releasing such pointless new hardware is completely nonsensical. It's akin to the dot com bubble,  and it reeks of massive malinvestment.

Legal tender laws. Government has a monopoly on them. If I offered a service where you can call me and my guns to harass people who owe you bitcoin, then bitcoin would be a lot more attractive option thanks to my service, since there would be a genuine force punishing people who walk out on their bitcoin debts. 
Government wouldn't let me offer this service. This is the exact same service they offer (replace "bitcoin" with dollars), but they want to remain the sole provider of this service, and they will pull out guns on anyone who attempts to compete. This is no metaphor or anything, they will literally use guns to give the dollar an apparent advantage.

Read some Austrian Economics. There is a market for investments; interest rates reflect the demand for spending. Sure you can maybe purchase 1% more if you hold on to your money till next month, but what if you can purchase 6% more if you invest your money instead? There is no domino effect, no depression. Deflation encourages saving, and the untampered economy evolves around it. Its when you intervene in the natural order of things that booms and busts start happening. If the rate of interest isn't the real, market rate of interest, then the distortions do lead to the domino effect you are talking about, regardless of whether currency is inflationary or deflationary.

I know, I use bitaddress (offline) regularly for my own cold storage :) What I liked about bctip was that it isn't an actual wallet, so there is no context in which they might want to keep the coins on there, so any coins that aren't claimed past a certain date are almost certainly unwanted, while with a paper wallet, they might want to just hold on to it in that format, and I have no way of knowing if unmoved coins are also unwanted.

Hi OP, thanks for your post, it was great getting to meet you at the Italian cafe, and we hope to work with you in the future. I'd just like to give an update about last night. The princely family was very impressed with my presentation, and are very interested in bitcoin. 
Although I only got third place, my presentation had by far many more questions asked during the q&amp;a period than the other two, and I dare say that it was the most discussed afterwards (all three of us, and my girlfriend were invited to a dinner with prince Michael and prince Philipp; they are both enthusiastic about bitcoin and think it has the potential to give individuals power over their money, which is something very important to them).
His serene highness Hans-Adam II thanked me for the bitcoin gift, and told me that he was very impressed with how much I had achieved for my age and how much knowledge I had. He kept the bitcoin flyer in his suit jacket. The address of the wallet that came with the flyer I gave him is 153hcotepxuP3mjSNPTPZNFDwvuyhKRoUw (please no one send coins to this address, or if you do, know that I have possession of the private key, and that the flyer said that I would take back all coins after the 1st of April, as to encourage every recipient to move the coins to a more secure wallet).
Demelza and I will move to Liechtenstein in August and run our bitcoin business from there (we would like to include OP as a business partner, but we are yet to discuss this with him, we will call you as soon as we are back in Toulouse ;), with plans to open a bitaccess ATM. We met with the regulatory body yesterday before the award ceremony, and I think we managed to pique their interest with an in depth explanatory PowerPoint about both bitcoin and our business.
We really hope to turn Liechtenstein into THE bitcoin hub. The princely family will be a very powerful ally in this endeavour, and I will keep in contact with them in the hopes of securing their continued support.
Edit: [Here's]( a photo of Pizza Azzurro with the bitcoin sticker in front. We'll post pics of the owners of Schlossle Mahal, and Made in Italy in front of their shops as soon as they receives their stickers by post. Also [here's]( a pic of demelza and I with HSH Hans-Adam II.

The essential difference between the "bitcoin bubble"(If such a thing exists) and Tulip Mania is that there is a community of people who see/understand a genuine rationale for the valuing and overall use of bitcoin in trade (Lets be honest, nobody during the tulip mania ever saw anything particularly wonderful about the plant itself).

Today it has been four years since the formal establishment of the P-Lib at a notary located in Madrid. Just short of [the milestone of] a thousand militants (activists) and an internal structure that is getting stronger every day in every autonomous region, we libertarian liberals have a party that, although still extra-parliamentary, can boast about several assets of great relevance. We can boast, firstly, of having survived, against all odds, **without financing*** or having to count on any sort of lobby[ing], just with the strength of our ideas. We can boast of these, the ideas of liberty, and having reached the unanimous recognition of other liberal parties around the world. And we can boast of counting with the best people; people that went all out in the winter of 2011 so that for the first time in our history, there would be a real [classical] liberal party on the ballots of our first constituencies, Zaragoza and Madrid
**Note*** that this party rejects all the regular governmental subsidies. Basically their constitution rejects all government helps, regardless of them being the only party doing so, and all other political parties getting this financial help.
We have seen many [troubles]( along the road, but the movement is in full growth.

This is countered by the simple fact that the word "donations" actually refers to monetary donations, and Bitcoin isn't considered "money". There is no law against sending bits of data to a political party.
Also, it's worth noting that this party constitutionally rejects government subsidies and insists on being funded on an entirely voluntary basis.
They're not huge yet, but they were only founded in 2009 and have made some pretty good progress since. They're the only Libertarian group in Spain.
