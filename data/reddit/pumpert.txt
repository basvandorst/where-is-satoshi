Safer in the sense that if an item is $100 I only spent $100 to get the item.

Most likely everything is based around etherium. The founders own a good portion of it and they are the ones that organized the expo.

Bitcoin/Alt coins as a currency for day to day transactions for a regular consumer doesn't make sense. Not only do you risk yourself to market fluctuations but you also have to pay a fee when purchasing bitcoins and sometimes when spending them its up to the payment processor. 
Its safer for me to pay with fiat or visa then it is with bitcoins. 
I still believe the tech has a lot of value but as a currency its going to take a long time before we see mass adoption. 
Right now its enthusiasts that will use crypto as a currency.

Am I getting those coins with a 0% fee? Why would Veronica who has never heard of Bitcoin go and sign up for a coinbase account and risk paying more for her Prada shoes when she could use her visa which already works as intended. 
Also the whole instantly converting Bitcoins into fiat is retarded too. If the merchant is doing that then what's the real reason for accepting bitcoins. Marketing?
The IRS has even made it more complicated to use bitcoin too. You have to pay capital gains if you do spend them and same with the merchant too this is an accounting nightmare.
Look I love Bitcoin, not trying to be negative. I just don't see mass adoption for using bitcoins on a day to day basis like I use cash.
