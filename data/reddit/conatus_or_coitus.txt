Thanks Yogi Berra.
Concerning Bitcoin - it ain't over til its over!

I'm as Pro-Bitcoin as you can be without being a maximalist but this is very legit criticism (absurd transaction fees). Thankfully with Segwit and soon-to-be 2nd Layer solutions this will be an issue of the pass, and of course on-chain scaling alongside that.
Besides, the habitual backlog is *largely* from bad actors spamming the mempool.

Smart enough to bust SR and seize assets...not smart enough to sell 30k BTC...

Paypal is a payment processor - it makes sense that they take money. You don't use paypal for *every* or a huge amount of transactions. Bitcoin is supposed to be an alternative to both fiat and payment processors. Imagine having to pay $1 everytime you used your debit card - even for a coffee and that fee can be backed up both by time and cost (average fees have hit $10 at times).

It's the evolution of currency - there's a chart flowing around where you see the stages... store of currency is on the ladder forwards.

That's a really weird way to list schools of thought as the major Sunni schools of thought interspersed with a single Shia one.

Go down the rabbit hole, my friend. :)

Well, Muslims number a LOT - but they're still a minority depending what your perspective is (Western-centric especially American centric-board). Chinese number in the billions but will be referred to as minorities in the USA or Scandinavian countries.

If you understand how Islamic rulings work - you'll know why there isn't a unanimous decision.
The rulings tend to come from precedent and deductive analogies. Depending on how they're presented with it - they'll be more likely to sway one way or another. Also, each person has their own biases and methodology of how they derive judgement (fatwa) - some would weigh precedent of immediate Successors of the Prophet's generation more than rulings of later Scholars. Others outright reject deductive analogy and say everything is Halal (permissible) until clearly proven Haram (prohibited) etc. That's just the surface...
There's also corruption - people who are directly/indirectly benefiting from giving Fatwas by those asked or "Fatwa-Shoppers" - people who ask as many scholars as needed until they get the answer they want and run with it.

LTC has shown consistent gains - ~25x YTD and great volume.
If you're looking to increase your fiat worth... hodl.

No that's now how it works... Watch a whale sell or move 1% of circulation in bitcoin and see the ripple effects.

I swear I saw the opposite on Twitter yesterday. He had 3 masters but the PhD was a fraud.
He claimed to have the PhD in 2015. He didn't.
He got one in 2017.

That's awesome.

I just saw that fake C# twitter archive. Fucking hell.

This will give you some context - happened before.
