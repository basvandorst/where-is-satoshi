It's actually been on a slow steady rise all week.

A lot of people still don't know WhatsApp Web is a thing.

Yup. All the people who were touting  may have quite possibly set the stage for Bitcoin's death.

Oh right of course. I thought there was some other event I was out of the loop on.

Wire (swift). What's ACH?

Why not this Sunday?

I was referring to transaction fees for purchases. If you pay for products in cash there are 0 fees. Actually some places will pass the credit card processing fee savings on to you saving you even more money for paying in cash.
None of the things you mentioned go away with crypto.

CEX is always a bit higher. I think it has to do with the big buttons on the home page that encourage market buys. I didn't even know they had a limit buy option the first few times I purchased with them.

But everyone is expecting it right now.

Good counter argument.

So it's an *increase* of uncertainty. Or a reduction of certainty.

A Snap-On tools *truck*? Do they go door to door selling tools?

Hardware wallets also require a physical interaction with the device to confirm sending transactions. So even if someone gained remote access to your computer during the brief period of time that your wallet was connected, they couldn't take money out of it without somehow tricking you into clicking "confirm".

Why do you believe the value to be much higher? It is still hardly used in the real world.

Think of it like this. In January you produce Batch 1. You sell it for a cost equal to 1 year of profits. In February you take some of that capital and start Batch 2 which you immediately sell for a year worth of profits. Rinse and repeat through the whole year. By the end of 1 year you have made 12 years of profit compared to if you had to wait almost all year mining for yourself before having the capital to add a second batch to your rig.

Yeah. They want to decrease the block size and add SegWit /s
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:47:49
Yes because people using cash with its stupid 0 fees are just itching to pay a little bit more for their transactions.

What does it mean to run a full node?

My limit buy was apparently $5 too low. I might be one of the few people actually wanting to see more dip right now.
