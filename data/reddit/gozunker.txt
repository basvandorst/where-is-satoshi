I had a Coinbase account for a quick second until they closed my account for some bogus vague reason. I moved to Gemini and never looked back. Low fees, quick transactions, can buy the second you initiate a bank transfer. GDAX is popular and lower cost than Coinbase I hear, but I avoided them because they are affiliated with Coinbase and Coinbase burned me. With GDAX and Gemini you need to put in a limit order to buy, instead of a quick Buy it now style purchase like on Coinbase. It’s simple to do but feels more technical. Like Bitcoin 102 vs Bitcoin 101 level that Coinbase is.

Guys guys, I figured it out. It’s because of me. Every time I go back to bed the price shoots up. Went to bed last night ... BOOM. Took a nap this AM ... BOOM. So back to bed i go to watch GDAX until I fall asleep. Just doing my part!

I moved some last week from Coinbase to a software wallet and it took a full day. I had almost given up on it :/.

That’s okay. Last week it was my turn, buying in at an ATH of $10,800 just before heading back down to $9k. Feeling better about it this week ;). Next week hopefully you’ll feel better too, and it will be someone else’s turn to stall it by buying in at the new ATH!

Ok I’m confused. GDAX has the price over $14k. Bitcointicker.co has it around $13400. What site is the official price?

Dropping quickly to mid 13k. Maybe losing some of today’s amazing gains? 
What site do you guys use to watch the ticker change in real-time? I’m on bitcointicker.co and the red-green scrolling of sells and buys is mesmerizing. Is there a better site to watch the action unfold?

Ok but what I really want to talk about is that creepy picture in the background
