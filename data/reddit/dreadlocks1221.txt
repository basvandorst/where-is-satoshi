I'm not saying that money isn't a lot is some places, but I'm a developer and about 30% of my prospective clients have outsourced their work for ridiculously cheap rates and obviously you get what you pay for, which is code that is total garbage and barely works as intended. Not to mention its hard to contact a company when there is a 14 - 16 hour time difference. 
I don't know how true this is, but I've read that in India to pass a class on PHP you only need to score a 50% on the exam, and that most technical schools there have incredibly low standards. 
I once contracted for an agency that outsourced a lot of their work and it was hell trying to get anyone on the phone let alone get the right information (which they didn't event give me). 
I'm not against shopping around and going with a lesser experienced freelancer to get a cheaper rate, but if you outsource your work to someone only charging 2 dollars an hour you get whatever garbage you get back.

What kind of proof do you want? A screenshot of the email saying they won't do anything? I don't know what I could have possibly done to violate their terms and their support didn't mention anything about that. They just said they have the right to cancel any transaction.

thanks one of your other support staff ended up helping. It was very frustrating when the first person just said that there was nothing they could do instead of even looking at the situation.

Why are there so many elance jobs on there? Most of them are horribly underpaid, for example the porn site that's trying to get a bitcoin payment api integrated to their site for less than $300
