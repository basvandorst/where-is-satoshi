It's gonna be great if he does end up being satoshi and the Bitcoin community has to talk around this stuff forever.

The tangible outcome was that photo that showed 90% of the hash power was like 6 guys

Let's talk about how Bitcoin is this totally brand new thing in its infancy despite this percent of the economy already being owned.

If he wanted his input to matter he shouldn't have taken 10% of the Bitcoin then vanished forever

Why even spend it at all then?
@_date: 2015-12-12 14:53:24
That sounds like a bad system

One of your mods is Changetip community manager are other tipping systems even allowed

That makes Bitcoin sound like a failure for cultists. If it's money you get shamed by the community if you actually use it and are required to buy double to spend any.

You pay the same price if you pay in another method.

What does running a node in Google cloud even add to the network?

Seems worse than traditional money.

The dumbest thing is that if it worked that way why not just make a bit worth a thousand dollars or a million or a billion dollars?

This seems worse than traditional systems

It's banned in this subreddit to post addresses. It's a total coincidence the change tip community manager is the mod here requires using Changetip.

They pay me to use my credit card. Any claim they must raise prices to cover the difference are irrelevant since I'd pay the same price if I used cash or checks.

Lightning network is far more useful as an unreleased hypothetical panacea than it will be as an actual seldom used product.

Bitcoin can only handle 3 transactions per second and that is way too small so needs to be increased. But at the same time fees are a disaster and miners get 8 dollars for each transaction right now and that is unsustainable as the reward decreases so making less reason to pay miners and loading them with more work and expense is seen as a mistake too.

Why should I pay a four cent fee, that is infinity more money than it costs to use regular money

Someone just sold you the idea the blockchain is magic didn't they?

People won't "throw a fit", they just won't use Bitcoin since cheaper options for payment systems already exist. Bitcoin isn't going to survive relying on charity to have people work against their own economic self interest.
