Did you have 0.05 btc in gdax before the hard fork?

I got verified on CoinMama pretty quick with just my drivers license and a phone bill, but you can only buy BTC and ETH there, no selling. Hope you find what you need :)

Pretty sure every place has to do this because of money laundering laws

Nah, you just gained an equal number of Bitcoin Cash as you had Bitcoin. Have no idea how you get the Bitcoin Cash though sorry haha

I see, so they value their profits from picking up dumped undervalued bitcoins more than their losses from profits on short contracts kind of thing

Ah ok I think I get it. Basically just luck of the draw when it comes to sending then, well, if you pay the high fee at least.

Yeah that's what I was thinking. In the UK Bitcoin was the top trending word on Google of the last 4 days in a row, a bunch of exchanges and wallets have shot into the app store's most popular list, and it's hit mainstream media.
Just before Christmas, I reckon it's just lots of people chucking £50 at it to see what happens.
Because as well, surely if it was just the same Wall Street lads buying, then why are there 200,000 unconfirmed transactions? Clearly these are low-value hence why they are taking so long because of the low fees, or maybe I just don't understand this stuff enough really.

Wow you're a genius why haven't I seen this idea on here before? /s

It's tiring. Scroll through new and tell me it needs to be brought up again.
If you believe that things will pan out exactly like this, sell now. Once it crashes once mainstream users will ditch crypto completely. Do banks want that? Of course they don't, they want the long term gains of being early adopters just as much as the rest of us.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:58:45
But why would you do that?
If a bunch of people sell now the price will plummet, if they buy back the price will raise again, maybe back to what it's at now.
If a bunch of people hold, the price will carry on increasing, and you'll be making the same profit either way, but bitcoin will stabilise at a higher price.
Sell during the rise, at an insignificant number, never at the top. That's why pretty much every exchange has just crashed.

Coinmama bro

Can't believe people were negative about this ��
That's great, you've actually helped more than you think! The more mainstream BTC becomes, the more great minds will work on it so that one day we could buy a jacket from you in a couple of seconds ��

But one thing I don't understand is that if BTC has a large crash, the mainstream market would probably never trust cryptocurrencies again.
It's not like with real estate where people will always aspire and feel a need to own property, if BTC dies a lot of ordinary people will abandon the entire crypto idea.
Why would Wall Street millionaires want to do that?
While BTC has a large user-base, these millionaires have a really strong platform to evade tax, store funds, make private transactions without needing to use a bank, like in the long-run, surely Bitcoin is a millionaire's best friend, and a government's worst nightmare.
What's more, the potential for growth if BTC continues to rise is ridiculous. If Bitcoin doesn't suffer a MAJOR crash, its value will surely just keep rising, meaning if big players both buy a lot of bitcoin AND take futures contracts that bet on the future of BTC, wouldn't their returns both short and long term be much greater?

Huzzah I hope! :)

I was thinking more of curious pets, but sure. :)
