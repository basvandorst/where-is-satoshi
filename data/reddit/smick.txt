If you walked up to a house and the owner was like “you like this house? Want to buy it?? All I ask is that you work 30 years of your life, and pay twice the listed price, which is already double it’s worth.”, would you get all excited? It better be the only house on the block, but no, there are houses as far as the eye can see. Further actually... :(

To be fair he claims to not understand it. But I don't think that means we should discredit his comments, which are based on what he does understand. Does crypto maintain it's value when you zoom out all the way? Popularity is not enough to warrant holding something. Popularity comes and goes. I personally believe there is value in crypto, but that it's value has not been realized yet. I think Buffet's comments on crypto are safe advice. I honestly believe there is a lot about crypto that the crypto community itself has yet to understand. This is an exploratory period. I think we have a lot to learn about decentralized value stores in general. Bitcoin is exciting but I don't think any of us know how this experiment is going to end. 
I personally think we need to stop thinking in terms of "which is legit" and "who will be king" and think in terms of allowing them all to exist, to decentralize value itself. Model them on some tangible sectors, a separation of responsibilities. I picture the ultimate currency that succeeds will be more of a value classifier than a value store. Model based on what you store value for. If your model 'foo' is comprised of and stores 'x', 'y' and 'z' and 'z' fails, your model 'foo' is devaluated by 'z'. But if 'z' fails, there's no reason that the model for 'a' itself should be devaluated. This could change the way we value everything including credit. Maybe you have excellent credit to buy a car, but poor credit to get your utilities turned on. Maybe there is a model to describe what a utility is, which does not concern itself with your personal history with healthcare models. One sector should not be allowed to drag another down. Something like that, but who knows how this is going to pan out. :)

Also read up on what constitutes manipulation. And don’t treat bitcoin like it’s a religion or you’ll go blind. Best not to put all your eggs in one basket, or visit r/btc, or buy coins that never gain from a pump.

According to the [what if calculator]( if you bought 300 worth back in apr of 2013 that would be about $55k. that's a lot of money, but not a life changing amount. If it helps, just know it wouldn't have helped anything, because that's assuming you never spent any. We've all missed opportunities. Keep ya head up. Don't be afraid of change. Magic is hard work.

But it's soooo much faster than bittrex, and when shit hits the fan I'm not flying blind. I use both, but gdax is so much faster. Their api is faster too, they offer websockets, whereas bittrex does not. Also, on bittrex, the realtime data is cashed for up to a minute, so.. goodluck with that.

Could this have been what caused the bubble to pop? Bitcoin was on a long run, and when futures rolled out I'd imagine people who were planning to buy bitcoin bought futures instead. And people selling futures, were probably selling bitcoins they held already some percentage of the time, slowing growth and confidence, then bch / coinbase came in with a needle and did the rest?

Dude, no way. That car is so ugly, and it's already looking dated. Besides, that amount of bitcoin is going to probably double in value in the next 6 months. Might quadruple in the next year. You should ask for like 0.2 BTC for it.

Why is that? Seems like you would prefer an active community discussing actual bitcoin news and the fallout thereof. And “Repeat information” is not a bad thing, it’s normal when huge stories like this break. As stories evolve they are told and retold with greater degrees of nuance and detail. Let the bad news play. people need to learn these lessons even if you think it hurts your “brand”. Or are we just here for the memes now?

it's all malware man. every great app keylogs you. apple. adobe. nearly every chrome plugin runs ga accounts tracking every click and copy. you have non stop traffic just coming and going on your laptop through every which port and the dozens of "root" privileged services and users on your laptop. You have open ports on weird unused protocols that are just listening for connections and at the ready to grant full admin privileges to the first app that can prove it knows mr disc. think of all the apps you installed man. And how many gmail plugins do you still have running from like 2005. They've all been refreshed dozens of times, they know when the perfect time is to sell you what product. And every company has a different lifetime value score of you, your family and your neighbors.

Anyone starting to feel like "Bitcoin god" Roger Ver might be working with the banks to sink the "bitcoin" brand? Feels like 80% of the posts on are about how bad Bitcoin is. They fork the bitcoin code, create a new "cash" brand, then adoption fails (compared to bitcoin), and now they want to claim the bitcoin brand, while simultaneously doing their best to destroy it. It's just small thinking and bad brand management in my opinion. Denigrating your competitor does not prove you to be better. It proves you're not thinking big enough. It divides your potential market in half. And while they may have developed a religious following, they have also put a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths. That is brand damage. And the hostility Roger Ver has for Bitcoin brand is very off putting. It doesn't project leadership, confidence or strength. It feels reckless, petty and misguided. I couldn't handle the negativity any more and unsubscribed from It got to be too much. I just kept thinking with every bitcoin bashing post "but what does this have to do with bch?". Appealing to people's negative emotions isn't how you build a brand and I'm sure it has cost them adoption.
