I have a trade history of over 18.5 BTC buying from them. I am no new customer. I'd just thought they would help a little more...is all..

Correct. So in that saying alone it does not state reporting to agencies. So this situation I will just not use them again. I am not concerned there is coin base, bit stamp and other sites out there. But my concern isn't with the company, when they stated that they would not help, I wouldn't plan to ever use them anyways. I just don't want to see turn into a silly collection. But by the looks of the terms, they won't report.

For those who don't now...circle offers an instant withdraw amount of $500 and allow you to withdraw instantly, then they withdraw the funds from the bank 3-5 days after.

Not really and answer. I've had my wallets stolen and the bank has to pay charges on my credit card. Is it my fault that my cards were stolen...yes to an extent. But I didn't have to pay anything. I understand circle is no credit card company....but the unwillingness to attempt to help, makes not to want to help at all. Which I asked the simple question. Does anyone know to what extend can they go to?

So back to my question. What happens if I don't? There is nothing they state in terms  about reporting. They do not have my full SSN. Good luck getting collections to support a virtual currency. I am waiting for some educated in this area to provide a decent answer.
