People should be warned. No need for them to waste their time to sign up, invite 3 more people and after that to find out what a scam it was. Revolut is all about gaining sign ups and nothing more. They need that to say "see how much users we have".

Maybe yes, maybe no. They main issue is that they are useless at the moment. And they have no plans to change that in the near future.

Mechanical watches are not only time telling machines, not any more. They started as tools but now they are something more. They are engineering wonders and a works of art. 
We call them watches but they are something more. They are our analogue harbor in a digital world. They show us what the true craftsmanship and handwork can be. They show us what a engineering truly means. A work of art that you can wear on your wrist. The only jewelry that a man can wear and not looking silly at a special occasion.   
Of course the good ones costs money. The precision needed to make one such watch and the time to handcraft it costs money. It takes hundred of hours for a watchmaker to build a single watch. A watch that will not only serve you but your son and his son. How many iphones have you saw to be passed down to the next generation ?

Actualy it did. Rolex makes everything in-house. Every part of that watch is manufactured at Rolex factories. Even the materials are forget in-house. Every part is hand examined and tested. The movement is hand asembled, regulated and tested. Then it’s sent for certification to COSC and when all the tests for accuracy are passed is hand assembled to the case.  
It takes about a year to make a single Rolex watch.
