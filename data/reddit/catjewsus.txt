we should compile a list of all lightning wallets for users

I feel like the logo could use some polishing 
@_date: 2018-09-24 20:46:28
Sounds like a better Steemit, I had high hopes for Steemit but the development and community weren't up to speed tbh and developers were lazy. The layout looks decent, but the logo looks more like a profile pic :)

BCH is only good for flippin in and out to acquire more Bitcoin. It's not worth investing in cause its really doesn't do anything that Doge can't. If regulation struck all crypto equally then Bcash would be done for because all of its outlets would be blocked off. At least BTC offers privacy options that prevent regulation from being even the least bit effective.

sounds awesome! I def would be excited about that.

I wonder if AsicBoost would hurt them later when quantum computers come in to actuality .

Is it cause woocommerce is with WordPress? Idk why these plugins dont appear first on square space or shopify cause they're more popular platforms. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 22:03:31
I feel like we need wallets that operate on and offchain. Where you can have control over some of your BTC on chain and off. AMP def sounds like it would aid in seriously finalizing the mainstream process of BTC. The more I learn about the capability of offchain solutions the more I'm amazed at the possibilities.

We need to have the first stage of lightning network implemented first. Let's focus on getting more developers onto lightning and finalizing its infancy. Then we can get more usage of it in small stores like btc did in the earlier days, followed by services that run payment API's like Stripe to use it.

HTC has the Exodus, hopefully if you guys get big some day and get partnerships with a cell company you could implement it on phones and be able to use your phones security features. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 01:25:15
Hope you guys get capital funding for this. Are you guys gonna launch by yourselves or over a crowdfunding platform? 
@_date: 2019-02-01 19:28:45

Mmmmmm DMM &lt;3
@_date: 2019-02-18 19:37:22
You can see from it but you can receive to a segwit address on Binance meaning fees will be higher. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 19:36:16
I've emailed their support about it and they seem to refuse, I think Jihan had some hand in Binance for a while, they ought to implement it or die imo. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 17:02:16
I think we're going back to the big jump and big drop patter before we go even higher again. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 01:31:31
Well consider something like this Jack Dorsey CEO of square has POS systems in restaurants and shops all around the world, and is a huge Lightning supporter and funder along with BTC endorser; these are here so that you can use them in the near future assuming that lightning becomes mainstream and Jack decides to okay LN payments over square. Though maybe by then he might launch his own hot hardware wallet or maybe there will be implementations on mobile like how HTC has the Exodus.

For the time being it allows you to have DEXs for BTC, people want to accumulate more via trading so if anything it can only be beneficial.

Here's what never makes sense to me how can taxes be this high for us yet people in the top percentage of america not have to pay taxes this high? This doesn't make sense, this is evidence that the government doesnt know how to tax crypto still and the IRS is making constant mistakes. Say people do pay these taxes how are they going to get reimbursed years down the line when they do figure out how to tax accordingly. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:20:53
I've been noticing its a lot of guys from r/btc bch folk and accounts that were made within like the last month or less. Ppl be desperate out there, watch out\~

If you care about electricity the most energy intensive thing here is going to be the hardrive, which is probably like 10 watts at most, if you care about energy efficiency more you could use a laptop 2.5" drive or ssd which will bring that down to like about 2 watts or less. The Raspi probably uses no more than 4 watts at max load usually none of the tasks will really ever be intensive tbh. Overall I wouldn't expect this to use any more energy than a cheap LED lightbulb. The most efficient setups wouldn't even use more than 6 watt tops\~

@_date: 2018-11-25 23:22:59
We need a guide on setting up the most simple diy LN kit with lowest cost hardware possible. I know the raspi is cheap as it is, but there are cheaper dev boards out there, and I'm curious how cheap we can get a new lightning node made for.

Isnt it a tad exp to give change in btc? I'd wait a little longer for lightning to kick in tbh. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:08:16
Value is determined by trade so long as people use something then it has value. People simply transacting is  value and that's what blockchain is, evidence of transaction value.

I'm astonished by the number of people getting involved with crypto without the knowlege of BTC still being developed on daily and the lightning network and other sidechains projects which are arguably the only developments going on in crypto in the bear market whilst other crypto rely on paying coders to develop their products. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:26:45
Oh dope this is like the metamask of lightning :D
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:51:44
I'm just waiting for lightning network to get out of beta. Once that happens then it will be easier to spend. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 20:43:00

D-Wave QC isnt a general purpose machine, it's certainly a QC imo but many argue that because its not versatile and general purposed, its not really a real quantum computer. Being so it's not really built to hack a blockchain.

@_date: 2018-04-09 00:41:39
Tbh i think the argument goes both ways, but even if people consider it an altcoin then theres nothing wrong with it. It wud actually be an altcoin that actually contributes to the main chain in the way of a peg, something that currently no altcoin really does. I would argue that it simply not an altcoin just cause your not trading lightning tokens but the same currency its still built on. On sidechains altcoins can be made still but not all sidechains have that purpose. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:09:46

There are several teams and people working on lightning. Lightning isn't just one project, its also several other projects as well. It's not just something that will end at like a 1.0 it will have segways into other atomic technologies like AMPs
@_date: 2018-12-24 21:26:31
Not exactly the best title, but the network is still growing I'm sure some other nodes will end up with more value on LN some day.

@_date: 2018-12-10 01:14:46
Tbh LN offers a pretty significant degree of privacy as it is. I think some people have discussed bulletproofs in btc here before and said that it would actually end up making the chain slower.
