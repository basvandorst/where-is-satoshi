This isn't about SegWit it's about Lightning, which requires SegWit.  Once lightning is implemented no ones needs Coinbase to convert to fiat and their business model, and that of the bankers who funded them, goes poof.

Of course not adopting segwit allows bitmain to maintain its unfair advantage with the patent technology it stole, hence (noSegwit) BCash.  A bit obsolete if dragonmint delivers on its new miners, likely part of why Ver has lost millions in potential profit, but hey who doesn't like centralized chicom coin, at least it can pay for lots of sock puppets.

No you are right Zimmerman invented it and Hal was someone who worked on it, my bad. Looking at the Wiki write up on Finney though I also saw something else I didn't know it says "In 2004, Finney created the first [reusable proof of work system]( before [bitcoin](  In addition here is a quote from Hal from the same wikipedia page, 
"It seemed so obvious to me: "Here we are faced with the problems of loss  of privacy, creeping computerization, massive databases, more  centralization - and [\[David\] Chaum](  offers a completely different direction to go in, one which puts power  into the hands of individuals rather than governments and corporations.  The computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people,  rather than to control them." Sounds a lot like the philosophic  underpinnings to bitcoin.  Don't know if Finney developed bitcoin and wrote the whitepaper, he certainly looks like the most obvious candidate to me though it might also have been a collaborative effort.  At a bare minimum he was central  to bitcoin's early development.

Krugman is not an idiot he is just not being entirely honest.  Central Banks, Bank of England, Federal Reserve etc are not a part of the host nations government.  The Federal Reserve is not Federal, it is a consortium of unaudited private banks who create a nations monetary supply and exact tribute from the host nation by charging interest on the money they create, it is an entirely unconstitutional set-up.  However, as Mayer Rothschild said, "give me control of a nation's money and I care not who makes its laws" The role of a central bank is to extract as much money as possible for the private banks from the host nation without destroying that nations economy to the point where it can no longer pay (though for small nations that is rarely a concern). Bitcoin is such a threat, in part, because it comes into being not as a debt instrument upon which interest is due but as a pure credit such as was issued in the original American colonies.  If you are interested you might check out Ellen Brown JD's "Web of Debt", a good read.  As Henry Ford said, "It is  well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and  monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution  before tomorrow morning"

Interesting line from the article, "The new currency will be called the sovereign bolivar and will be based on the country’s Petro cryptocurrency"  Does anyone use the Petro?  I don't see it listed on coin market cap, are there any exchanges for it, does anyone mine it, does it even have a wallet? I think I read where it might be an ethereum token, should have just pegged the new currency to BTC or at least ETH.   One silver lining to this is if people do start getting paid in Petro it might become a lot easier to just convert the Petro right over to BTC.  Edit: Just one more thought are people who are using BTC also sometimes converting their funds to U.S. dollar tether coins or another stable coin?

Somehow I don't think is a law on the books anywhere at this point for a 51% attack on a cryptocurrency, I don't think there is even a consistent definition across nations what a cryptocurrency is.  Wrong, unethical, but yes, good question does it break any laws.  On the other hand when you start talking billions of dollars at risk of going poof in a day, when you have competent people who live and breath crypto, it is probably difficult (I am guessing here) to hide "oh 6 exahash of mining just appeared and there has been a fork" without someone tracing the miners.  In such a case, there might not need to be laws for consequences to occur if you catch my drift.  On a related note, these nations, Venezuela, Iran, Russia starting or talking about starting there own national crypto, i.e. Petro, if these are new coins, who is mining?  They seem to think it is trivial to just replace BTC with a centralized controlled variant.  Do you make a massive outlay in hash power to secure the network? That gets expensive and if centralized would be prone to centralized failure points.  If some nation did actually pay Maduro in Petro for oil you wonder whether the NSA would just fire up a half dozen GPUs fork the coin and say hey thanks for next months budget, or perhaps just an unfortunate electrical spike hitting the government mining facility.  If someone traced this to the NSA or MI6 or whoever, what are you going to do, bomb them? I'm not expert in the area but my guess is centralized national cryptos won't work because they would be expensive, insecure and prone to a few major points of failure.  Maybe something like an ETH token could work, but that would not be something the government would have control over and what would you say if there was another wallet bug in ETH and your national crypto was locked up for good?  No there is a reason BTC is King, the whole approach was genius.

Over time, crypto POW mining should equilibrate to a reasonable profit over outlay and electricity costs.  Right now if fluctuates between wildly profitable to unprofitable.  PoS may make the issue obsolete, though as far as I know it remains unproven on a large scale and may have problems of its own.  If PoW remains necessary, it is, imo, an issue that as btc price increases mining will increase to consume all profitable electricity until that price.  If the rollout of lightning continues apace this may be less of an issue in that a given kilowatt of energy spent mining might be validating orders of magnitude more transactions per block.  Still if mining increases with btc price and btc price goes back up at some point one will be consuming an awful lot of electricity.  What I see happening is local and national authorities taxing electricity used for btc/crypto mining.  This is one tax that I am not sure is a bad idea, but even if it is a terrible idea if I were in government that is what I would try to do, get my slice of the pie.  We already see pusback, saw an article from here a while back about a municipality that refused a mining farm in New York as it would raise electricity prices.  If a power provider said we won't give you 10 mW at 4c/hour how about at six cents/hour take it or leave it, the farm, if they took the deal, would pay taxes, the increase in electricity costs could be offset and have some left over to repair potholes.  If the hashrate of the BTC network were cut in half from having a 2nd tier electricity cost for mining, would it be substantially less secure, it was half this rate what six months or a year ago.  If solar continues to become cheaper, or for that matter natural gas stays cheap, it might also have the effect of miners building their own electricity production for the farm to avoid the taxes. 
TLDR: How long till electricity for btc miners gets taxed?

No, no, no you said it all wrong.  The way it always written up is if bitcoin is at say 7,000 and it goes up to 7,500 in future it would have bioken triple resistance pattern alpha which would be bullish meaning it could go to 8,000. However, if ii instead goes lower to 6,500 this would be bearish, it would break long term support and could go to 6,000.  Then just rewrite the same article the next week with either 6,500 or 7,500, if it goes high it's bullish but could be bearish, goes down that's bearish, but could be bullish if it starts going up again.

I'll give the most obvious explanation of this, I hope I am wrong and some may say, how dare you, conspiracist, to which I say, let's ask Satoshi. I think Mark, may figuratively or literally have had a gun held to his head and something along the lines of, "you like your father, don't you?" said to him.  It would explain a heck of a lot of his bizarre behavior including his lack of communication to people who confronted him angrily in person.  And now every bitcoin he ever touched, poof, up in smoke, that makes lots of sense.  And you can imagine what those formerly MTGox coins might due in terms of trading.  I mean come on, I am just a nice guy (occasionally) and I can see the exchanges to fiat are the logical attack point, why else is Mark acting like a mute 2nd grade moron asshle?  If this is even possibly true, smarter people than me might think on defenses such as some sort of peer-to-peer exchange.  I hope and half suspect I am wrong but I won't feel fully reassured until I speak with my imaginary cryptographic friend Satoshi.

One other recommendation I might add for Police Departments.  If the call is not from the home number of the house that supposedly has a problem it should be standing operating procedure for the PD to call the home number of the house in question.  This could be done while cars are en route or even better while the reporting caller is still on the phone.  In this case Jameson was able to reach his wife which may have also helped defuse any difficulties, however as he points out if he was at home and his door was broken down it might have been a problem.  A phone call from the PD to the house costs the PD nothing in terms of response time, nothing or next to nothing in terms of money and could help avoid a lot of potential misunderstandings.  It is a common sense precaution if you are sending a SWAT team to the house of someone in your community.

Sick of the all the speculation about an ETF.  I don't want an ETF, I want lightning to continue to progress to where I can go to the corner store and buy a sandwich, once that happens it improves the world.  Not saying it was causal, likely contributed, but it was to the day that futures were introduced when BTC crashed a few months back.  An ETF is just a fancy name for adding another tentacle to the shell game where billionaires try to jerk people around, it offers nothing of value to the BTC community and is diametrically opposed to the decentralized philosophy Nakamoto did his best to enshrine into code.
