I made $9k on bitcoin in a month I know it feels good but when I woke up 2 Saturdays in a row and the price dropped $20 each time I had to get out. Dollars are not irrelevent by any means....maybe in 10 years if BTC takes off but PLEASE never say that until then.

You brag about not taking money from your parents or the gov but you're fine "investing" 1500 worth of borrowed money even if the coins are at 10 or at 200? Nice logic...

I guess you and I consider a "large" profit two different things.

You realize the other markets traded as low as $50usd today right?

These are bots and are done on the forex market as well. Bitcoin is never going to be used as an actual currency at legit physical locations until the price settles and only fluctuates in small amounts similar to the USD/EUR or any other major currency. At this point it's just speculators gaming each other and honestly you can make much more money here right now than you can in the forex market. Im getting in on this speculation early next week and not looking back.

$250 per BTC? no.

Let me guess it was another Saturday/Sunday early morning sell off? Thats why I got out of BTC. Too many big players can influence the market at any given time for their benefit and our lose.

Did you even mark highs or lows and draw it based on that or did you simply draw a line....

I wouldn't call it inflation protected cash when you have 1000% swings in a few weeks.

Its a hassle you have to get verified and usually take sending in application forms or going directly to their office.

Forex isn't nearly as volatile and it has $3 TRILLION in daily volume. No one except the BIG, BIG boys are able to move the market. And even then they can only do it in small margins.

I saw a guy posting about bitcoins back in 2011 and didn't even bother researching it or anything. I emailed him today and asked if he ended up making a killing or not. Never heard back so guessing he killed himself...
