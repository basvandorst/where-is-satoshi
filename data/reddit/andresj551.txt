It sees the downtime is because someone/s enter the system and none of the users data was compromised.
I personally have transaction data with them, including my identification card and my bank account number (they ask for a local bank transfer, so they don't have credit card numbers).
It's the cheapest way to buy Bitcoin in Chile and I hope it comes online again soon.
@_date: 2016-04-10 16:57:13
I think you are confused, the wallet.dat contains multiple addresses. If you receive multiple transactions, then the file contains multiple addresses. 
You cannot backup your wallet for the future transactions and most likely you are watching an old and empty address, not a empty wallet.

Me preocupa que suba, en teoría el router no deja que mi nodo se conecte a otros nodos que no sean los 8 que están listados.
¿A quien está enviando que datos de mi nodo?
¿Alguien está tratando de obtener mi billetera?
¿Es tráfico de esos 8 nodos?
@_date: 2016-04-02 21:07:43
The nodes seems very normal...
It could be i have a shorter latency and relay the new transaccions/blocks faster? It makes sense to me, specially because it isn't Gbs, instead almost 2x the income traffic.
Thanks, for your opinion!

Está consumiendo de 1 a 2 veces los MB de bajada, lo que me lleva a pensar que es sólo retransmisión de los datos que llegaron antes a mi nodo que a alguno de los 8 que ya están conectados.

Hmm, I think it's a good system, if you have a bank account in both countries... I don't have a bank account here on Argentina, so I can't withdraw the dollars back to pesos.
@_date: 2016-04-02 21:48:10
It makes sense to work for Bitcoin, but not so much to buy it. I'm living in Argentina since the last year, here I cannot have a bank account because i'm a tourist. I have to pay rent, but I cannot get transferences from other countries because I don't have work (They ask me for a DNI and a worker ID) So my only solution is buy Bitcoin in my country with my bank account and using LocalBitcoin to meet someone here who has ARS.
It works perfectly, I never had a problem with this system.
If I work for ARS it doesn't make sense to convert it to BTC because it's very expensive here... The best option is buy food and pay rent.

It's my opinion:
Women uses technology if it's secure, easy and massive, this happens before with credit cards. They are a lot more rational about new things, and if it looks  difficult, illegal or unstable they don't buy it.
Sadly Bitcoin is still difficult for the average of population, it has a bad reputation and it goes from 300 to 400 and back in less than a week.

As an investment it's very volatile, that means you could make 100-300% on profit or loose all your initial capital.

Long story:

It's (at my point of view) a very wide variable for a smart contract.

It could be done as a functionality for a wallet, but for a "smart contract" it seems like an overkill.

The "team" is all of us. Anyone who wants to add code to the source.


Just copy the source in another repository.
Blockchain isn't a program like windows, anyone can be a developer and there is many copies (litecoin, dogecoin, etc.) nobody can "switch off" the blockchain because it's on every one's hard disks, and no body can "erase the program" because it's on every one's repository.
The only way to stop Bitcoin is shooting down the Internet.

I agree, sites like localbitcoins helps in the start. But there is also important to have business who accept payments and sell Bitcoin at lower prices. The ATM's are the last chain, because it's focused on people who doesn't care about the price and how Bitcoin works, only want some to try the easy way.
@_date: 2016-03-20 01:24:19
Hi, I'm from Chile, here it's very easy to get Bitcoins, there is one business ( how let you buy Bitcoins online with debit/credit/transfer. Since in Chile we have "la cuenta rut", witch is an account free of requirements (you only need your ID "RUT") the easiest way to buy is going to the bank, ask for your account, put some money to it, and buy Bitcoins online.
All kinds of ATM's charges a very hi fee, and some of them are very very slow.

@_date: 2015-11-09 00:13:10
I understand your question and I have been thinking about the same matter.
If Bitcoin is successful, the price will stabilize and the holders only will get the benefice of use it, but not the profit.
If Bitcoin fails, the first who sell will get a bigger reward, and the rest will loose. There is no more money on Bitcoin than the market capitalization (wich will be divided between the holders who sell first)
Personally I hope it success, because it make my life way easier here in Argentina, the fees for using/transfer/hold money are insane...

your screen/obsession is even bigger than mine.
@_date: 2015-11-11 02:29:44
Not panic, sell all Bitcoin to me.
@_date: 2016-05-20 04:58:30
It's just garbage...
@_date: 2015-11-16 22:08:46
Do you want something like a webpage?
If this post on reddit go up it could get a lot of attention.
@_date: 2015-11-12 04:41:09
Based on the price going up by 1,5 dollars for 55 transactions...
@_date: 2015-11-06 14:42:31


It's pretty expensive, I'm sure there is many other "commercial services" way cheaper.
@_date: 2015-10-18 19:45:42
I currently have free electricity, but it's (by my own research) not worth of effort trying to mine some bitcoins because there is too much competition. The best way to get some revenue is trading and that is a risk if your bank doesn't allow it.
    
I'm no one to stop you from buying some hardware and give it a try by yourself, that's why I said "good luck".
@_date: 2015-11-23 19:55:46
there is no way... the router isn't mine.
@_date: 2015-10-06 02:56:44
nice try.
@_date: 2016-05-09 02:33:14
I'm holding and working for BTC.
@_date: 2015-10-23 02:44:58
I bought at $230 and holding until... THE MOON
@_date: 2015-10-30 04:56:44
I have just made a transaction on Paypal...
@_date: 2015-11-25 15:51:20
Thanks you very much.
@_date: 2015-10-29 19:57:20
Internet on a ideal scenario.
@_date: 2015-10-20 03:28:47
Do you even know what a malleability attack is?
I made a question.
@_date: 2015-11-24 04:51:23
That's the point, I have a large bandwidth unused.
@_date: 2015-11-25 20:13:38
Gracias a ti por leerlo :D
@_date: 2015-11-17 02:21:03
It's difficult to go viral.
@_date: 2015-11-22 02:57:49
Ohh the hype...
@_date: 2017-05-15 20:34:47
¿Hablas español?
@_date: 2015-10-22 22:43:49
Turn on the pc.
@_date: 2015-11-12 04:59:47
To the moooon
@_date: 2015-11-27 20:20:29
Isn't that the way they receive the 25 BTC reward?
@_date: 2015-11-14 03:56:54


Can I ask?
@_date: 2015-11-16 18:24:19
I have 2 Bitcoin but is hard to hodl without knowing if Bitcoin will succeed.
@_date: 2015-11-25 20:15:52
Muchas gracias, el código es simple y está allí para el que quiera usarlo. Si necesitas la base de datos, igual.
@_date: 2015-10-22 22:56:31
It's photoshop.
@_date: 2015-11-25 17:42:51
Muchas gracias.
@_date: 2015-11-05 22:39:17
Please, make the next scene where he falls and the Bitcoin price goes up to 1000 USD (years) on the cryogenic machine.
@_date: 2015-10-30 05:01:51
And back to normal... 324 and going down.
@_date: 2015-10-25 20:23:40
What if i want a donation button?
Every transaction will be more and more difficult?
Bitcoin is the liberty of choose wherever you want to use it.
@_date: 2015-10-20 16:45:17
Sorry about my "english bad" I just want to be a "contributor" in this community.
I'm open to learn about anything if you want to teach me.
@_date: 2015-11-11 16:04:08
@_date: 2015-10-28 03:02:35
tomorrow or the day after that and maybe never.
@_date: 2015-11-17 14:12:23
I just added it to the form.
@_date: 2015-11-13 00:11:12
me too!
TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2016-05-30 21:01:48
Until it breaks into 5000.
@_date: 2015-10-30 23:14:47
I have one.
Because I hope it goes all the way to the moon.
@_date: 2015-11-19 23:26:58
Thanks you very much.
send a buck
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:28:10
It looks suspicious indeed...
.com --&gt; 104.16.16.137
.info--&gt; 190.93.243.195
Just in case, don't trust.
@_date: 2015-11-20 17:26:55
It seems estrange... I know the "10 minutes per block" is an average, but how many time is "normal"?
@_date: 2015-10-27 02:36:29
I don't know man, it looks like magic, but I'm pretty sure it isn't.
@_date: 2015-10-18 18:29:49
The easy way is buying used AntMiners, a lot of AntMiners...
There are currently (not kidding) farms of specialized hardware mining Bitcoin on China, where the electricity is cheaper. You would be competing with that, unless you join to a mining pool who keeps the 1% of your work.
Despite of that, good luck.
@_date: 2015-11-24 04:48:57
I want to colaborate on the Bitcoin network. I'm paying for the internet and the electricity, but i'm not using all the bandwidth.
Where I live, the "admin" isn't very "costumer friendly". The router has a password and it's not accessible physically.
@_date: 2015-10-20 17:14:06
Good answer.
I think it's not need to save the generated keys. If you want to "kill" bitcoin, you just generate and erase until all were used...
Maybe i'm misunderstanding how private keys works, but it would be useful to know how many time is required.
@_date: 2015-11-07 02:44:30
I'm on Bitcoin because of the hi fees of the money transfer services on Argentina.
After a while, I decided to hold some, just in case.
@_date: 2015-10-27 23:19:21
It's hard to describe because there isn't something like it.
They will get used to it.
@_date: 2015-11-16 21:38:14
Something like this?
@_date: 2016-05-27 03:03:34
The bip32.org plan sounds very good to me.
@_date: 2015-11-24 04:50:10
Thanks, but i have no possibility of changing the router settings.
@_date: 2015-10-20 16:47:57
thanks for the answer.
@_date: 2016-07-10 17:11:26
I don't see it, and i live here.
@_date: 2018-12-26 04:38:45
I'm checking how to implement a LN node. I thought it would require a full Bitcoin node (not pruned) so I will give it a go. Thanks for the links!
@_date: 2016-07-06 00:54:29
Why 0.125 BTC and not 12.5BTC?
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:51:16
Yes, I think we all waiting the price to recover, so it's nice and calm.
