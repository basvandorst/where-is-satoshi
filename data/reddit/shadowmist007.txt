The government going to have the resources to stop it, haven't you heard how the government want to have a internet kill switch because of "cyber attacks." Hey they could use that switch for something else now against bitcoins. 
Okay i think you got it all wrong at least in the U.S we are actually experience deflation. Which is super rare obviously, that why none of our goods cost as much as Europe.

Lol, you don't get of rid of dollars and euros, they are the big dogs, they been our currency forever now, at least bitcoins is a nice alternative, but you don't put it all one basket :/. 
One of the problem of bitcoins is perception, remember perception is hard to change, just like your first impression, after someone has a view on you, you not going to be able to change it. Even if you're super nice, open doors for them, ect. they still going to think you're a dick.
I feel like the government can easily make people perceive something for bitcoins if they wanted too. If they started now they can easily take down bitcoins because they have the money and the network to do it. They have the resources to do it.

Yeah but with paypal you could have call and cancel the transaction, or report and get your money back. With bitcoins you have to have good faith.
