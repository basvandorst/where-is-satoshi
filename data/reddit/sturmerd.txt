Im sorry but a politician is a politician. Your goals may be noble but i dont think politics is the way to achive them. I mean why use a hammer if you need a crowbar?

Heres the thing. We can keep voting guys like you in, but it wont make a difference until we have literately gone house to house and convinced people that government is bad. Until then you can get in, talk to as many bureaucrats as possible, parade a libartarian flag around, they are still going to leech/ruin society. 
What i mean is, we dont need politicans in this fight. We need to go "house to house" and find everyone who is interested, and open-minded enough to see what is going on. Fuck politics. And the politicians. They are not going to make a difference. And when they are/can, that means the hard work is over. Politicians just mimic whatever they can to get some votes. When certain laws will begin being repealed that means people who cared, would have "touched" enough hearts, opened enough minds, that politicans will begin mimic that. And then the cycle starts over.

They used the word Can, not Will. What i mean is a pool with over 25% can cheat the network, but that does not mean they will. Furthermore what damage can be done will quickly be undone due to miners leaving it in rage. Being a pool, and having even 5% of the hashing rate is lucrative. Much more so if you have 25%, or more. I dont fear it will turn on the network. And if it does, i dont fear that miners wont leave it.
