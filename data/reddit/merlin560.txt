Its not how they treat bitcoin.
Bitcoin is just an asset.  It would be the same if they were buying and selling sneakers or jet airplanes.  It is how they treat asset classes in general.
Hong Kong is probably using a hybrid British/Chinese set of laws.
In any event, liquidating the assets to pay folks off is probably the key.  If they do not have the cash/liquid assets to cover everyone they are insolvent.  Being insolvent means that the asset classes are paid off in order.
In most companies, it is bondholders, preferred stock holders, common stock holders, and then vendors.  You and I would be vendors.
If I had a lot of money in bitcoin, the first expense today is to get your bitcoins off an exchange and onto a save storage location that is not liable to be stolen.
Aside from that, Bitfinex folks should be making plans to find more money elsewhere.

What would you say it is?
And calling an asset is being generous.  
Very few jurisdictions will call it currency because it's not minted by any country.
I am just curious what you would think it would be categorized.

TA is backward looking.
There are people on these threads using TA by simply drawing lines.  No one ever talks about context, history, patterns, and discussing their shitty calls--as well as their great calls.
You read a lot of book-talk about TA (There are Head and shoulders everywhere!)  But very few people are demonstrating where their calls were BEFORE the case...and why.
Its fun to watch.  But so isn't a train wreck.

I am a boomer.  I have lots of boomer friends and coworkers and siblings.
Boomers generally fall into two categories--the Pre 1960 boomers and the post 1960 boomers.  The Pre 1960 group is not as computer savvy and doesn't get bitcoin (or cryptos for that matter--they are interested in the fourth mortgage on the house.)  The Post 1960 boomers are more likely to be like then Gen X neighbors.  
Most of my friends don't know shit about bitcoin.  And honestly, they are not interested.

I am not sure that is really accurate.  Except in some Congressional offices.  :-).
I've worked in the telecom, finance, and health care industries for 30 years.  I have never worked in an environment where there were different pay scales by sex.  There ARE different pay scales for different job skills.  When I started it was not common to see women climbing telephone poles.  Now it is.  It wasn't because they were not allowed to; it was because they chose not to.

It is my understanding that the inflation rate is low because the dollars that were printed to buy mortgage backed securities was almost immediately deposited in the fed as excess reserves.  With interest rates near zero, the banks can make a halfway decent overnight rate by just leaving the money at the fed.  No risk, some reward. 
Seems to me that when they have to risk money out in the world we will see that money flow out of the fed and into the economy.  When that happens, the inflation rate is going to move pretty quickly.

A great amount of the QE was in mortgage backed securities.  I imagine the Fed is probably the biggest landlord in the country.  Think about that for a minute.
Imagine that foreclosures take on more of a political tack rather than a purely financial one.  (Foreclosure is a distasteful, but important part of any lending based economy.)  
Think about an enviornment where there is high inflation, mortgage rates goes up.  At the same time the baby boomers are dying off in record amounts, leaving a glut in the housing market.  This is going to kill real estate taxes.  It is going to kill real estate prices.  There will be a buyers market--driving prices down.  Existing mortgages will go deep under water.
It is not a pretty picture.  And the person holding the bag is going to be the Federal Reserve, who's bag is full of MBS.

I dont know why we just don't have different "products"  (well, yes I do...because they already exist).  Banks have many different products that all lay upon the basic deposit system:
1.  Cash for daily, small transactions.
2.  Debit card for convenient, relatively small transactions.
3.  Checking Account--ancient, but useful with a written record is important.
4.  Money market account--same flexibility as checking, but with a longer term deposit interest.
5.  Savings account.  A static, low interest money garage.
6.  CDs--longer term, less flexible storage of value.
7.  Investment vehicles--less liquid, market driven, and much more risk.
Different products do different things.  And they are all on the "money blockchain."
The different products are already out there.  Just as you would not use bitcoin to buy coffee, you would not use a money market check to buy starbucks.  
Its really not a different paradigm.
@_date: 2019-06-25 10:42:50
That is simply not true.
A wire transfer from another facility that uses KYC will not trigger a suspicious activity report.  If you deposit a check drawn on another bank, it will not trigger an SAR.  
If you walk in with $50,000 in cash one time, it will trigger an SAR--but hardly anyone would look twice at it.
If you did that ever other day, it would get looked at.
The IRS gets their reports different ways.

I just bought one for a relative from there.  No worries at all with it.  It downloads all of the software and gives you all the set up keys when you download the software the first time you use it.

The reasons I think this may be wrong is the current movement in a few places:  Venezuela is buying NOW, regardless of the fork.  The news out of Iran the other day will have people moving into new positions.  And finally, the CME news will have both "consumer" reaction and those hedge funds that wish to have influence on the futures market will have to load up to move the price back and forth.
All of these things are a commitement to the status quo.  If there was deep thinking that 2X was going to be a bug factor don't you think they would have waited a couple of weeks?

I was a Senior VP for the 19th largest bank in the US for 10 years.  I am very familiar with the SAR rules. 
Trust me, the stories you are hearing are the exception and I guarantee you there was other shady stuff going on.
A periodic transfer to and from a Bitcoin exchange is not going to trigger an SAR.  Also, if you are making multiple transfers of $50k or more at a whack, you need to call your bank and tell them to expect it.  If they have questions, they will ask.
The biggest problem I see is that the public doesn't understand the rules, and they see their local banker as the enemy.  If you are legit, you should establish a relationship with the bank.  Your local branch manager is the most powerful person in that system--that's what Know Your Customer is all about. 
If you do not think your local branch doesn't want your $50,000 deposit on their books, you have no idea how retail banking works.  That is a big deal, even in a big branch.
Learn the laws.  Work with your bank.  Understand how shit works.  Being rich, young, ignorant and paranoid is going to end up with you being young and poor.

In a cash sale, title search and all of that crap can be waived.  Of course no attorney is going to worry about that.  I sold my mom's house for cash.  They did a title search, but almost nothing else.  I had done an inspection to know what was wrong with the house, and the buy accepted it--as is.  I think he was going to tear it down (the property is what was valuable.)
Cash sales take a lot of crap out of the process.

You don't know much about banks and the way they measure their dicks do you?  
Up until they hit about $75billion in assets they tell you how big they are.  Then they identify with their asset rating by telling you how they rank.   It is kind of a habit.  Everyone at a bank who is not a teller is a VP.  Local VPs (Branch Managers, Ops people) would simply be managers in other businesses.  District or regional VPs ran lines withing a region or a State.  Corporate VPs were usually Operations folks like IT, HR, lines.  I was a Corporate Senior VP.  I was in charge of all of the contact centers for the entire company--multiple states, sites, and business lines (retail, mortgage, etc.)  When you are measuring dicks, the descriptions are funny because you have to list out what kind of VP you are, the Division (retail, commercial, trust), and the Bank.  In front of a lot of other banks you might need to use the "largest XX"" in the country.  
So, I was a Corporate Senior VP of (Call Centers and stuff), reporting to the EVP of Retail who reported to the President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board of the 19th largest bank in the US.  Try putting that on a resume and having to explain where you were on the org chart.
Bankers "got it."  Everyone else just thinks you are a pompous ass.
Every business has their identification tools.   Medical/Healthcare systems are just as bad.  Everyone has their egos and their dick rulers.  It gets real tiresome after a while--mostly because the closer you get to the "top" and you are a specialty you KNOW more about your subject than anyone else in the organization--and yet, they all act as though they are the smartest people in the room.
One of the interesting things, in the context of the start of this thread is that everyone in the company who dealt with customers or the people who deal with customers had to do the SAR training after 9/11 and the Patriot Act.  (And the first day the wire room opened after 9/11 we had to do a transfer for the Bin Laden Construction Group.  That fucking wire took forever because it was stopped every step of the way and they had to check with "Legal/Compliance.")
Top 25 was kind of a big deal, to coin a phrase.  Of course, top ten looked down at top 25.  And top 5 did not even talk about anyone else.
Ambition was never really an issue.   I pretty much called it a day in my early forties.  Then I worked for myself for several years.
This would have been when most people in the thread were in pull ups.

My background was not in banking.  I came in from another field to work on sales and call centers development.  
Have you ever hung around bankers?  I used to sit next to the marketing people because they had a sense of humor.  I thought they were the most stale people I've ever met. Then I went to work for a health system.  Boy, was I wrong.  Medical staff have NO sense of humor.
So, the short answer is, I was very happy to take my severance, options and start my own completely unrelated business and work for myself.

There are things you "can" do, and things you shouldn't do.  The deeds thing is only to assess taxes.  As long as the taxes get paid, the town doesnt care.  (Well, I am sure they care...but you know what I mean.)  You don't have to get a title search.  Most people do because of the fast turnover of property.  Of course an attorney would want you to do A LOT of things.

If nothing else, you learned that you were describing what a bank does when there are SA issues.  
We are simply speaking two different languages.  Honestly, my bank deals with my bitcoin fine.  I don't really give a shit about the problems of some guy on the internet.

You would own a fund that "tracks the price" of bitcoin.  For example, a Silver ETF holds a rolling series of silver contracts so you will reflect the current price of silver without holding the metal.
A Bitcoin ETF would also be able to trade on a normal stock exchange.  This presents the impression of legitimacy for a lot of investors.
Finally, the ETF "should" hold an equivalent amount of bitcoin to fund their holders.  In a volatile market the flow in and out of the market could be magnified because of the "noobs" dumping in massive numbers.  It will be interesting to see how an ETF would manage their coins, how they would be stored, and how often they will update the coinage to match the market.
For these reasons, I think the SEC is not likely to approve one until the entire crypto market shows some price stability and long term storage security.
