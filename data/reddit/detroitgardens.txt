Thats valid, that was literally the first day I had discovered Crypto. I had know about coins for all of 24 hours and discovered Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Cash fork days

Read some of my other posts dude, don't just cherry pick one single comment. I've written bullishly on Bitcoin several times.

I never said that in my life. Where do you even pull that from redditor for 2 days?

Hey, I'm on Bitcoins side. I'm just trying to understand how we dont go off a cost cliff due to electricity. 
if you're saying this is wrong, please explain to me how Bitcoins network could scale to accommodate global usage without using more power than is feasible?
Trust me, I'd really like to understand

energy use per transaction x number of transactions. Even if it could scale to paypal, we are talking a huge amount of energy consumption that makes mining Bitcoin increasingly expensive and costly. 
I own Bitcoin and have a large investment, I'm saying this as a Bitcoin supporter.

I am 100% invested in BTC currently lol. I don't even own Litecoin

I don't know crap about patent law, I just was in a conversation and someone was suggesting they had the patents for blockchain. I immediately thought BS

Ah great this is what I was looking for ,do you know which exchanges handle this like bitfinex?
@_date: 2018-03-24 21:38:31
Damn okay, I wanted to see if I could monitor when large numbers of deposits showed up at an exchange but I guess they all go to individual wallets, not the exchanges wallet.

I called again and asked this exact question, and the individual checked and maintained they fully intend to support Core. 
I asked why then is Silbert promoting SW2x, and the guy was unsure.
I sent a follow up email for an answer.
