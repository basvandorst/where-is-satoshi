I'm anti government, so it came up naturally in my circle of internet friends.

This. I am anti state and therefore anti tax, but holy fuck if we are going to steal everyone's money, at least use it to feed, shelter, and otherwise help the poor. Don't use it to kill the poor! 
Edit: Yeah, downvote NOT killing people.

I moved .03 back to coinbase 36 hours ago. It took about 14hrs to go through with about an $19 fee.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:31:19
Oh I see now.

Bitcoin is blockchain and IOTA is tangle. IOTAs big advantage is supposedly being able to handle millions of transactions per second between IoT (internet of things) devices.  For free.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:29:58
Fuck that. yes it is.

Holy shit I knew he was an alleged douche, but this confirms it.

Mostly morbid curiosity, but it's a good sub to learn what NOT to do in life if you want to remain alive. Also, I wanted to desensitize myself somewhat because of my anxiety disorder. I have always been afraid of death.

I use mycelium, but it's the only wallet I've ever used. Seems ok to me.

I've been watching bitcoin for years. Always being broke and never putting money in until it was at $3000 and $5000. I thought maybe I was too late. Apparently not.

Haha I did the same thing to get me to .12 I just knew it was going up yesterday afternoon.  Sad. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:51:49
And i'm sitting her waiting for Wednesday to  buy because I'm out of cash right now. Sad!
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:11:21
Can confirm. Fuck the government. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:39:43
Holy fucking shit. I am subscribed to r/watchpeopledie and this vid was more gut wrenching than most of that sub. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:18:32
Me three. I'll see you down in the depths.

North Carolina raise up!
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:18:00
Yeah I meet some who think it's a scam, some who have friends that use bitcoin, but I have not met a user in real life (that I know of).
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:41:04
I'll eat your balls if that happens.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:49:29
IDK but hodl and buy when you think it's down enough. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:12:44
There goes my hero.

Lamentations 
@_date: 2017-10-29 03:59:28
Perfect. The exact amount my poor ass has. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:06:11
I bought my first .075btc between $4600 and 4900, then only had enough $ for .025 in the dip. My .1btc has gained like $100 though. Crazy.
