Do what i tell you now! If you don't, you will regret.
Sell everything you have right now and don't look back.
Forget about Merchant, BlockChain 'Technology', Marketcap, Coinbase, Exchange, Paypal, Analysis, ETF bullshit.

I'm gonna tell you why this chart is here and what it does.
* This chart should makes you comfortable with the situation right now. 
* This chart makes you feel ok, because it happens according to this plan/chart. It seems natural.
The truth is, Bitcoin is going down and you should sell. 
It is not panic selling.

tech start-up :) so.. Do you invest your money in some start-ups?
You know how it works right? They come to you with a presentation, goals and you are the handsome guy who evalutes their portfolio and decides to invest and give them your money. They have a place and you know the guys.
I want to ask everyone here. Who invest their money in start-ups?
If you don't what the fuck are you doing with your money? Don't let ppl brainwash you. Some buzzwords you don't understand. Some Chart (xD the charts and so called analysis get me every timie) you don't undertand, which looks very pretty at first glance.
Buy and wait for the raise. NONONO! We live in 21st Century
This will not work with this bitcoin start-ups things. Wake up!

Bitcoin is not a fund!
Listen to me. You can NOT just buy and wait it to raise! :D
**EVERYONE REPEAT AFTER ME:**
You CAN NOT just BUY and wait for the RAISE!
You CAN NOT just BUY and wait for the RAISE!
This is like to buy **lottery** and wait for the **jackpot!**
WTF are wrong with you guys? Oh wait! Someone will get the
jackpot. Yeah SOMEONE not YOU! You are just the pig which get slaughtered.
Sell! You learned your lesson.
