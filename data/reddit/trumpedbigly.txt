If the truth hurts, go find a site where you can all circle jerk each other.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:51:39
It's only crypto shills who do not understand this.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:07:35
I hope you have alternative means of making your dreams come true.

"I told her that I'll prefer to invest those $10k in Bitcoin because I will make more profit than what your bank offers."
Good luck with that.  LMAO
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:07:16
Exactly. Every existing crypto will never be stable enough to use as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:19:53
You should know the old adage "Don't try to catch a falling knife".

People who got in early and the already wealthy own 99% of Bitcoin. Anyone getting in now is just a sucker.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:54:59
If you're a drug dealer (or any retailer for that matter), you don't want to mess with a volatile currency. It makes no sense to use Bitcoin when all you're looking for is stable value, plenty of other cryptos do the job just fine.

Because more people are learning about the ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:18:55
People like myself told you it was a ponzi scheme...
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:46:32
"It won't hit 17"
You people are either clueless or shameless shills. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:49:43
It's a ponzi scheme and people are catching on.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:56:01
That's how you do it - get out of the ponzi scheme before it crashes.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:48:50
Another shameless shill encouraging people to throw away their money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:41:52
The ponzi scheme is exposed. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:57:05
Did any of you liking this video actually watch the show?  Many people like her went home with nothing.

They didn't need to charge him - they already got him prison for life without parole.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:14:27
Investing isn't about being "tough", it's about being "smart". 
I feel bad for the new marks to the ponzi scheme, but you were warned.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:58:17
Keep HODLing.  LOL
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:43:02
This is why Bitcoin never was and never will be a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:24:51
The Russian government = Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:24:01
What went wrong is it had a flaw from the beginning - no inflation. It was always going to become a pump and dump scam instead of a real currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:18:17
It's going up, eh?  LMAO
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:05:47
OK, good luck with that. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:54:55
That how the owners of tulip bulbs felt.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:56:02
It's the fatal flaw in crypto design - without built-in inflation there is no incentive to spend it like a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:54:26
This makes zero sense. 
People earn dollars either to spend them or invest them to obtain a higher rate of return than inflation.
That's how real currency works.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:15:17
Fiat money is backed by the economic strength of the country which issued it.  The U.S. dollar has an overall steady inflation rate which can be used in calculating the overall return on an investment.
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:25:48
If you really want to create a digital currency then create one where every person on Earth is given 100, say, "Earthcoins".  Because the distribution is fair and widespread there will be incentive for people to trade them. They aren't all sitting in the hands in a few miners who got there first.  
Another important thing for a digital currency is inflation.  Without inflation to encourage spending it's not a currency but an asset (like Bitcoin).
@_date: 2017-03-11 05:47:58
It's impossible to tell how many Bitcoin transactions are real exchanges and how many are fake transactions between Bitcoin owners with different wallets.
Bitcoin and gold are very similar, I agree. Bitcoin's strength is that it's anonymous while gold is tangible and has other uses.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:12:26
It's a finite resource like a 'share'.  
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:10:15
The price of Bitcoin is manipulated by a relatively few people to keep the value increasing.  That part is a scam.  It does have value for transactions but mainly for illegal uses. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:34:26
The ponzi scheme has failed. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:22:12
If you didn't sell at 19,000 then you are a moron.
