except kraken - they're ok kinda.

Don't use blockchain.com it's a Ver website - use something like  instead + it looks cooler. Then don't forget to claim all the sh*tcoin forks of bitcoin and dump them at market for BTC.

I think it should be a comparison of something more normal, like news or netflix streaming that can't be attacked by puritans equating bitcoin with only porn, crime, drugs and energy usage. 
Eg;

I confuse nothing. Do a little research - there are a heap of sites and companies all hostile to BTC and they have a common theme. Go check his twitter bio for starters - then boycott all that shit.

"any altcoins (coins other than BTC or BCH)" - BCH is an altcoin - article needs correction.
@_date: 2018-08-03 20:58:21
just keeping the uninitiated educated.
@_date: 2018-08-02 21:32:24
The BCH army is out in full force this week, preparing the astroturf for a CNBC pump no doubt.
@_date: 2018-08-02 21:49:10
Bitpay and Coinbase are both hostile to bitcoin. Use other means such as BTCPayServer and coinmama.

Yes the community makes it strong. Part of that is education and part of that is helping the newbies along, just like in sporting clubs, OSS projects and your job in the office.. onboarding people.Newbies see bitcoin-dot-com and hear the 'BrokeCash is bitcoin' line.. just a little helping hand every now and then never hurt and it's giving back to the community as well.

consensus and your node
@_date: 2018-08-02 21:51:59
These guys don't like bitcoin and will pull a swifty to get you to use BCH as they push their interest in that direction.

Coming from an account named Opticbic.

No - it's a festering pustule, you have to call it out to lance it or it will infect the newcomers who don't have the immune system that we've built up. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 03:33:13
Yeh,  but if you keep getting poked in the eye with a stick, it's time to snap the stick. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 21:53:56
Call it like it is. 'bout time we got some integrity in here.
@_date: 2018-08-02 21:30:06
yep, nope.. where are the miners? No banks and intermediaries there.

so good rekk

These concern trolling questions are getting a little better, at least there's that. You earned your 50c per post on this one.
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:18:58
So I made this thing a few months back after getting frustrated with the same old news templates and bland feed aggregators out there. Sharing in the hope that you find it useful and check it as obsessively as I do. Feedback and suggestions welcome, enjoy!
@_date: 2018-05-30 05:25:27
That stick has too many forks anyways
@_date: 2018-05-09 00:39:51
very nice work!
@_date: 2018-05-03 02:38:58
But he's still using Bitcoin Core.. which is also not OK.
@_date: 2018-06-30 11:32:44
Looks pretty good to me bitcoin.org at the top as they should be and would be better if bitcoin*com slipped a few rankings. No conbase also a good thing.
@_date: 2018-06-11 23:38:16
hahaha.. good one.. CNBC being 'accurate' 
@_date: 2018-06-04 00:25:55
So now MS has access to all of the code (even in private repo's) there. great.
@_date: 2018-06-29 18:20:51
There is no if - it IS centralized. And there's a group of douchebags who want it to stay that way and are retarding the progress of the whole space in the desire to burn it all if they can't be the digital money emperors of the world.
@_date: 2018-06-29 18:17:46
"Bitcoin a buy" - there, fixed it for you
@_date: 2018-06-30 23:14:49
hmm yes that does suck..Bitcoin.org definitely needs a "buy now" button or direct links to preferred direct buying outlets to make it easier for Joe Public - bitcoin*com has a direct link and they're still using the "bitcoin core" shit and placing baghold cash ahead of bitcoin - which btw they should have to legally change that language now that there is an actual "bitcoin core coin (btcc)".
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:52:36
Nice try fellas...but I'm tired of this concern trolling.
    Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin, it's a forked alt and they can't be compared anymore.
    Bitpay is hostile to bitcoin and you should use other alternatives like btcpay instead.
    Lightning and other pending BTC innovations will render BCH obsolete as a payment option, the new narrative is "BTC is a store of value and BCH is payments" - desperate to stay relevant and this new narrative has been handed down to the sockpuppets to spread to survive. Enjoy your double spends and 0conf scams boys. Watch out for this new angle of propaganda in the coming days.
@_date: 2018-06-29 18:14:43
Oh you mean centralized digital double-spendable tokens? So.. like fiat but an alt-coin. yeh, THOSE buggers.
@_date: 2018-06-01 00:09:27
Nice work!

A joke of a puff PR piece.
