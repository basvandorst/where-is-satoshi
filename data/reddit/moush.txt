That's because they do something that is a recognizable service or contribution to society.
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:55:00
You could know nothing about any of that except trading and still make a profit on bitcoin, which is exactly what the majority of users are in it for.
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:03:52
You're right, "most people in the world".

He can always offer them a piece of the stolen money he takes after each round.
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:22:56
Yet you guys are talking about economics and the banking industry when it is beyond your understanding.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:52:17
Government doesn't mean Politicians.

"Hey guys, we totally lost all your money while cashing out, but we're going to file for bankruptcy so we can stay rich and not payback anything we lost."
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:21:16
It can't be.  He's probably arguing that it would be better if Bitcoin was treated as a currency as opposed to a commodity as it is now.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:34:30


People that want to make money sounds exactly what people who use BitCoin want.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:01:37
I don't think you even understand the point.  You're saying they're good because you can make money and buy illegal stuff without the man getting to you.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:58:58
I can see you're still using your childhood email knight222

If you're paying for a meal, and your money flies out the window, do you still have to pay?
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:06:26


It's sad how much people love sensationalist shit without any substance (or even worse, misleading or false information).
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:24:07


Not for the companies running anything.  Why should they bother with that when they can just up and run away with all their users money with no recourse?
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:32:15
All exchange runners are criminals.  Who else do you think runs an exchange for the hottest way to launder money?
@_date: 2014-05-02 19:37:31
I'm blaming robbers for being robbers.
@_date: 2014-03-13 21:56:04


This is why no regulation matters.  It's not really fraud.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:29:40
Is it even considered an asset though?  I highly doubt people here listed them for their taxes.
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:04:52


This is the prime problem with reddit.  The company employs barely anyone and makes their users police the site.  I don't know why anyone expects it to ever get any better.
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:34:23
Better delete your reddit account if you value privacy so much.
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:21:36
The main benefit you guys are touting here is instant fund transfers.  Paypal can easily do this and bitcoin is really no different except it's backed by the blockchain instead of linked accounts.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:03:14
It would be if bitcoin users would hold them accountable, but they're too busy trying to make a profit to care.
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:54:14
So leave?
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:18:26
The tech certainly is interesting, and it's a novel idea.  The problem is that it's a free market with no regulation so it'll never work.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:44:38
It's not protecting people from being stupid, it's preventing scammers like mtgox was doing their business.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:24:42
You're exactly the example we're making fun of.
@_date: 2014-03-21 17:02:27
Stuff like this is why it will likely be regulated some day.  Businesses will always try to find a way to save money and I'm pretty sure that's something Governments hate.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:23:23
You really have no idea do you?
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:56:22
There's a concept of this guy trying to scam more bitcoiners cause they're easy marks.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:43:17
It's funny people are blaming dumb people instead of mtgox who basically took up and ran away with their money.
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:55:01
And then they convert the bitcoins into money with a transaction fee.
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:25:49
Even if they become liable for the funds they lost, they've already taken enough out of the business to become wealthy with all the backers and fees.
@_date: 2014-05-02 20:02:20
Who enforces these rules though if there is no governing body?
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:24:00
It's not just MtGox, it's the entire currency people should be weary of.
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:53:53
Yep, and then you have ones like Tax evasion that have been around forever thus your point is moot.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:53:03
Yes, I'm sure all these exchanges are out to make friends with customers not make as much money as possible in the wild wild west that is bitcoin exchange.
@_date: 2014-05-02 18:44:10


This isn't possible.  You can try to avoid the obvious ones, but you never know what will happen.
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:53:25
It could be taken that way, but I highly doubt the creator intended that.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:33:45
Only if he gets to choose who makes it.
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:25:24


How do you intend to enforce any rules (or laws for that matter) if it's free of government authority?
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:55:53
Trustless system because you don't know who will steal your money?
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:52:35


Except for anyone who uses an online trading website.
@_date: 2014-05-12 14:53:24
If there is no one to enforce, it can't be a law.
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:08:35
He knows less about technology, but Bitcoin isn't about technology, it's about trading to make a profit.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:22:25
What kind of person would just up and set up an exchange?  The kind that wants money, and money does bad things to people.
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:08:05
He knows more about investment than anyone here ever will.  That's what bitcoin is and it's hilarious that you're trying to play his success down.
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:50:03
Fiat is still better.  No paper trail.
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:09:26
He already said he's cashing out soon.  Even he doesn't see the financial merit is keeping bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:00:32
It's too late to save its reputation.  This post is just another prime example of the bitcoiners that people love to hate.
@_date: 2014-03-13 21:14:47
It wasn't exactly theft considering it was their money since it's an exchange.
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:11:21
No one's arguing that paypal is good, just that it's doing exactly the same thing you guys say is bitcoin's main strength.  Also, I'd rather have my money frozen than lost forever like mtgox.
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:51:51
Do you really think the vast majority of people here or anywhere investing in bitcoins knows anything about financial responsibility?
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:02:42
Because you know who he is and why he chooses to remain anonymous?  How do you know he's not scamming like the majority of them?
@_date: 2014-03-03 08:07:59
Withdrawing and laundering.
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:10:36
He doesn't need to understand it.  It's being traded like everything else.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:04:39
Do you really think that sane/smart people would waste their time here?
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:08:44
It's free for the end user.  The same can't be said for companies like coinbase and other exchanges taking advantage of traders.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:19:58
Bitcoin is actually worse.  If you lose them you're sol.  If your cc gets stolen, you get everything back.
