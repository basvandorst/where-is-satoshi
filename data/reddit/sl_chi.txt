If you're not even aware that current lithographic techniques for CMOS chipset manufacture are easily mod'd to accommodate various materials, or that "Helium compression" is actually referring to what appears to be a standard Sterling Generator (already available to supercool lots of stuff  in the market)... or that you have no idea that ASIC chipsets "process" information... or that "upgrades" are most likely hardware upgrades..... then you my friend need a trip back to junior college science. You work for BFL or Avalon? LOOOOL

"no one does that" ... online :D  I have an american express gold card with a theoretical limit of 50,000.. you dont see many hondas or business servers sold online lol. We write them checks and send transfers ;) (would be nice if they let us do it though!!)

CC payments over 10,000 USD? looool... no one does that dude

Oh thats not nice! Ive seen videos online where people generate liquid nitrogen from atmospheric air for under a grand.

click on "our tech", they give a brief outline

lol? dafuq? two words AVG - FREE.... that site is fine

how much is avalon paying you? youve been trolling this product all day. Whats the point of them copying a competitor using already available/dated tech? if those figures are correct, it out-performs even an "upgraded" avalon system and uses less power too....

I think theyre using a Sterling Generator to pull this off (basing this off of "Helium Compression Technology") - assuming im correct, the condensers would get super-chilled and basically condense N2 or any air for that matter like water condenses on a cold glass. Thats kinda awesome though!

Kinda makes sense that anyone that would pop 15,000 on a computer could easily dish out 75$ to install a plug/breaker similar to what most household appliances costing 1/4th that require anyways?
