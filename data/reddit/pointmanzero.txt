no, because if bitcoin continues to grow in popularity the govts will continue to regulate it further. 
Don't listen to me about this, listen to warren buffet. 
You guys have created a virtual percious metal. A collectors item. A commodity. Not a currency.

I may not know about all this fancy schmancy coins, but in the old days... in the old market, when insiders took money....it **always** popped back up again. Despite the best efforts.  You just can't hide large amounts of money.
@_date: 2014-05-28 01:25:13


No no no, they lobby YOU to convince you that inflation is bad.  The phrase "printing money" was actually invented by right wing think tanks.
The talking points and bumper sticker slogans all come from these groups that come up with marketable slogans to convince the naive to follow their bullshit economic theories of greed and short term gains.


Amazing. Thats what a central bank is for.


When you agree to hold USD$ you agree it's inflation/deflation/interest rates are determined by the central banking authority.

This guy is an idiot.
He has been running around for years preaching the religion of gold.
Guys like this is why people stay away from bitcoin. They think it's just a bunch of libertarian kids.

Currently it is a collectors commodity (like a PM) and the answer to your question you don't want to hear. 
You would need a central regulatory agency so that it is capable of standing alone.
This goes against the libertarian cult that has sprouted around bitcoin.
**Also you need the ability to inflate it to meet demand caused by expansion/adoption**

If you want a large portion of 8 billion people to use this currency 21m is not enough.
There is a reason why currencies inflate.
Central regulators prevent MTGox from happening. Or at the very least gives precedent to punish people when MtGox does happen.

Look at the free market at work.
You guys wanted this. All of you.

Your concept of currency is flawed. You don't own it. The state does.
It doesn't have your name on it, it has the unions name on it.
You don't make it. The state makes it and allows you to use it for your convenience.
The idea that they could steal something which they already have control over is silly, childish and just a koch brothers bumper sticker slogan.
Human society has existed for over 150,000 years.
We can trace back centralized govt and govt issued currency over 10,000 years ago.
The state you live in existed long before your birth and will continue to exist long after your death.
Understanding this is profound.  Your desire to stake ownership of resources on a 4.7 billion year old planet for 75 years is so laughable.
You preach narcissism. 
You should go to some estate auctions sometime and remind yourself those people spent a lifetime acquiring material possessions just to die.

You would think so but the billionaire has lobbyists who bitch and complain about inflation, and economic think tanks.
It works like this, if the koch brothers stand to lose 50 million due to inflation over the next ten years than spending 35 million to try and stop it is perfectly logical.
You and your voice is choked out by the amount of political speech those billionaires can generate.
I would love for you to give an example of a long term stable economy that does not practice inflation.
If inflation is so bad then bit-coiners should stop mining immediately and say THATS ENOUGH,  because mining is inflating.
It's an inflation with a built in taper, but still inflation all the same. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 21:19:53
No, you inflate because if you don't the currency becomes stagnant and the economy dies.
People HOARD MONEY which slows down the economy, inflation is supposed to be a way to get money into the hands of people that use it.
But a long time ago wall street figured out they could just vacuum up the inflation dollars straight into the market.
If you are not worth multiples of millions of dollars you never notice inflation.  You only notice it over long term trends.
Let's give an example. 
If the M1 money supply is 3 trillion and you inflate it 100 million 
That is an inflation of 0.003%
So the working guy who makes 50K a year and is worth less than 500K doesn't even notice his money inflated 0.003%
The working man lost 15 dollars.
Meanwhile the billionaire who owns 50 billion dollars experiences the same inflation because he is using the same currency.
That rate of 0.003% caused him to lose 1.5 million dollars.
Check my math, don't just believe me.
This is why rich billionaires preach the lie that inflation is harmful.
Every time we inflate they lose millions.
Meanwhile joe the plumber is not effected noticeably at all.

Valve Inc works as a socialist co-op.
I have been informed (by the much smarter and open minded people of ELS) that they are in fact a corporation and not an actual co-op though, despite the fact that they behave as one.
I have been wrong on the internet before and nothing ever happens. My life continues to be amazing.
