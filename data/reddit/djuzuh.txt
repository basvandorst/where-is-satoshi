A common suggestion is not to buy more bitcoins that you can afford to lose.
If you can only afford 0.1 bitcoin, can you really afford to lose them?
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:35:53
how would you enforce it?
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:36:16
I don't know why they would pay you anything in this situation to be fair.

by pure curiosity, how does steam view selling your account? is it against their TOS?

Nobody knows.
Also, why would the current price be hilarious?

A massive bank run.
Some undiscovered flaw in the protocol.

without wallet or private key, they are lost.
I'm not sure exactly of your situation, can't quite make out what you are saying.

You don't seem to know what either a ponzi scheme is, nor what bitcoin is.

more serious question. Why would anyone pay for porn on the internet :P.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:10:42
it is lost.
But there is some sort of checksum builtin in an address, so most likely your client will tell you your address doesn't exit

The quote is from myself (this thread popped up quite a lot).
And he does know how backup works, but considering the value at stake "maybe" he copy pasted his entire home directory one day or something.

give the song away, put up a donation address for people who enjoy the music.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:15:25
No idea.
But are you showing hidden files?
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:07:39
* Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:02:35
You are aware this is a ponzi scheme?
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:18:05
from your point of view no.
But if the value is 2k, then the value of all bitcoins in circulation has doubled.

Try to contact your registrar, most protect you from name squatting.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:20:45
Welp, the guy came on  on freenode 2 days ago, and asked if there was a way to recover the files frome somewhere somehow. People in this chan then convinced him to at least try to go to the landfill. The next day he gets contacted by the media.
So… since we saw it happen in real time, and the dude really didn't want any attention, he just wanted to get them back, I'd say it's legit.
He's probably still in the chan if you want to talk to him.

@_date: 2013-11-28 14:28:17
just make an encrypted paper wallet in this case.
There is no need for a client if you don't use the wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:45:29
Another attack vector that popped up while reading your responses is if a skillfull attacker gets access to your usb key, he can change the image to make it store the decryption password, give you your key back, and take it away again once you used it.
So just keep it safe :P
Also, asking the questions was at least as fun as responding to them, trust me.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:13:14
Another reason to consider bitcoin is that there is NO WAY people can retract their payment.
Once they sent you the money (and it got approved), the money is yours. Period. No way to get scammed.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:35:44






@_date: 2013-11-30 16:04:49
Couldn't they pay 1,337 $ for it? :/
EDIT: oh, you made a typo in the title. I suppose 1136 is more accurate :P

that's assuming every bitcoin user only owns a single address :p.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:02:26
I toyed myself with the idea of putting QR codes as stickers over the city and see if I get any tip (obviously with a meaningful message, not just a donation plea). But I never went threw with it.
Welp, I guess I'll put a btc address on my blog once I go around and publish it.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:53:52
a paper wallet is made to not get hacked remotely. You need physical access to retrieve the coins.
It has never been a mean to be anonymous.
@_date: 2013-11-30 12:46:04
maybé you just bought 1 BTC from somebody who has 1k BTC? :p
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:31:47
Easiest way is to find somebody on localbitcoins.com IMO. Either cash or wire transfer.
It will probably be slightly higher than market price, but more conveniant
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:49:48
1) what each private key holds is public. How many private keys a single entity has is not. And yes, if somebody starts to sell a lot of shares, it will most likely create a crash (but how many would be needed? and why would somebody do such a thing?)
2) yes, it could.
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:56:52
The source code is the "recipee" of a computer program.
Let's imagine you go to the restaurant. If it would be a "closed source restaurant" (microsoft, apple, etc…), you'd have to trust them that what they put in your food (no backdoor, no security bug, etc…). With open source (like linux), since you have the recipee, you can either check out yourself how they made it to be sure, or trust the principle that somebody competant omewhere checked for you.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:19:31
backup the seed of electrum and you are good to go.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:25:00
Forget about mining on a home computer, it's useless nowadays. Specialized equipment is just too strong of a competitor.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:57:03
the funny thing is that they ask bitcoin donations xD.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:26:37
So. You think you are smarter than the market if you want to gain money by trading?
(Something that works is to buy on mtgox/bitstamp and then sell on localbitcoins at a premium, because people will pay you for your service/for the conveniance)
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:01:56
your phone is probably stolen.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:37:18
because most of the users here want bitcoin to be adopted as a serious monetary system.
They believe in the system and/or want the price to go up.
And the best way to do so is to use them.
(Also, to reward/thank merchants who decided to take the plunge)

Can you get free cash?
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:54:25
why would anybody panic sell?
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:04:21
You are selling a physical objects. Not something digital (which is the problem with bitcoin).
If you provide the tracking number, paypal will not reverse the transaction. It's the same as selling a bike.
That's my understanding of it.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:24:34
I'd use base64 instead of hexdump. you get more data in with the same length. And depending on the algorithm used, length is important, because starting at a certain length, you may get collisions.
I'm no expert though.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:59:14
well, instead of buying something with dollars, spend your dollars on bitcoin first, and buy it with bitcoin.
hoarding and using bitcoin are not mutually exclusive.
Just get more bitcoins next time you buy some, in order to spend them.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:12:31
bitcoin wasn't usefull as well at its debuts.
litecoin does have some advantages, the main one is that it's new, so people can still jump in early before it takes off.

the people who mine your block.

If they'd do, they'd use cash in hand :P
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:55:14
transaction fee is how much I have to pay to send bitcoin to somebody.
Not how much I have to pay to exchange some currency into bitcoin.

Sooo, you have a mouse, keyboard, screen and raspi all hooked up just to sign your transactions?
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:39:16
1. Irrelevant. with bitpay they get dollars directly for example
2. Will get better the more it is accepted
3. lend your bitcoins? how do you think saving accounts work?
4. money is useless to people without money. Great point ! And who's to say getting a bitcoin credit won't work one day
5. Who knows?
Another 5 minutes lost on the internet to respond to this.

yuup. It's hard to pull off, but doable, and you should be aware of it :P.
I'm not a huge fan of security by obfuscation, but I guess it kind of works in your case.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:52:52
Because there is still way more potential. It is better than the other methods. It could overtake paypal and western union for sending money around the globe. Every second human could want some. It could even replace the way you pay your coffee in the morning.
In addition to the fact that it can grow so big, it is also finite. So the more it gets used, the more the price will shoot up.
In fact, every time somebody loses his wallet, this bitcoin will probably never be retrieved, so the number of bitcoins available will maybe even decrease.
But at the same time, things can go horribly wrong :P.

Because it has the potential to do a lot more. But it's not sure.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:22:27
Or, you know, somebody discovers a flaw somewhere, huge panic, everybody sells, bitcoin is now useless, need to find a replacement.

minimalistic design doesn't mean devoid of any information.
There is about us, no information about your compagny(like, who the hell are you? all we have is a name), your WHOIS is completely devoid about informations(and 3 months old). There is nothing about shipping, about TOS, no link to social media, the site looks like a 2day project.
You are way below market price. Your name looks very scammy (why do you use the term booze if you only sell one liquor, and a "prestige" one to boot?). 
You only sell in bitcoin?
There is just no way you could make it look more scammeyish

@_date: 2013-11-28 15:44:43

those are like 10$…
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:12:47
* I suppose you have a /boot unencrypted on the usb distro to boot from it?
* How do you store your paper wallets at home? (a study safe which can't be picked up?)
* Do you fully own the PC you use your usb stick with? (for example: no chance of there being a physical keylogger in your keyboard, or no chance for the printer to store everything it prints? No chance for a BIOS malware? Hell, even your printer can be hacked if it is connected to the network or somebody has a physicall access to it)
* Do you fully trust the linux image you have on the USB disk (it has not been compromised, etc…)? Do you disconnect the PC you use from any network, including bluetooth, wifi, lan when using your usb disk?
* How do you handle your passwords (saved in your head only? not used elsewhere? long, not common, etc…?)
* Considering your method to spend money of your private keys with mycelium: if you have the public keys of your other cold storage wallet, just spend what you want, and send the remaining on another wallet, instantly, as soon as you use a private key on your phone, I would consider it unsafe. there is so much that could go wrong. This is imo your weakest point. You should really consider flushing everything to your other cold storage addresses as soon as you use one with your phone (maybe create empty ones in advance?)
* Do you use the [3-2-1 rule]( at least for your backups? you seem to cover the two media (paper + usb), but you need another remote backup. you need to be safe from hackers as well as simple data loss (for example: your home takes fire, or burglars just take everything) The 3-2-1 rule is the standard for any kind of data, so if it's sensitive (depending on your fortune), you want even more security.
Of course, it's always a tradeoff between safety vs usability, and some or most of those advices are overly paranoid. But you seem interested in being safe.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:25:17
as soon as you have a private key, format doesn't matter.

Also, knowing it's now worth a lot of money adds some intense to get it back.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:51:59
Think of bitcoin like stocks. The current value is how much people are thinking it'll go up in the future, while not paying to much on this bet.
Do google stocks have a 50-50 chance they're going to go either way? :P
