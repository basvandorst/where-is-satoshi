My biggest gripe isn't with the technology, but the users.  Most users only care about how much fiat they can make from investing in bitcoin.  To be honest, I don't think the mainstream majority would want to be involved with a currency dominated by greedy nerds who got lucky by investing early.

Bitcoin yet again only thought of as an investment to make fiat money.  Good job!

Hell... even people in Bitcoin are just looking to make money.  Look how many people want the coins they are holding to be worth millions of US dollars.  It seems like people are only interested in its worth in real money.

The rich do what they want.

Mainstream adoption will most likely never happen.  I have seen too many threads and heard too many people treating it like an investment so that they can make money.
The early adopters and one's who are invested in bitcoin seem to be the one's pushing for global adoption.  They have the most to gain or lose from that situation.
The bitcoin riches push businesses to accept bitcoin, so they can cash out into physical merchandise.

Bitcoin only has value to people because they compare it to fiat money

Another case proving most people don't view bitcoin as a usable currency, but a way to invest and make money.

Just hold onto it and hope it is worth millions one day.
Buying things with bitcoin seems fun, but there isn't much point if you buy bitcoin to turn around and buy another product.  Unless you want drugs... Sigh.
