It is inspired from that Conspiracy documentary "Zeitgeist" by Peter Joseph. That is what that "awesome dude" with the goatee is supposed to be. It is full of conspiracy bullshit. Just doesn't help that Fractional Reserver Banking itself is shady.

That is such a dumb "logic", I don't even know what to say. Some statistics on an experimental digital system somehow now speaks for the entirety of society.
Why are there not more women in bitcoin?
Clearly, because there is no injustice and diversity is bullshit! Cannot be that digital currency are extremely volatile and investing in a technology in its incipient stage is not a prudent financial move for many, *men or women*. Nope, a political narrative needs to be shoved right there.
This is the saddest grasping at straws I have seen yet.

"The Clueless General Public" part is so perfect.

Wait, for real? How do they impose such a terrible policy, amidst the insane inflation? It would be nice to have an AMA on this some day.

I was here, expecting some further corroborating news of Bitcoin taking on the Goliath USD. Rather, the whole thread is about debating "an historic" vs "a historic".
Much like the Bitcoin, I don't know what to expect from you guys.

When I visit 4chan, I cannot decide whether to laugh or cry or be horrified. It's simultaneously a treasure and cancer of humanity.

Ironically, the fluctuations are a result of the philosophy of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies: decentralisation. Speculators and rigging by big banks is wreaking havoc on the value of these cryptos. The only reason I would see someone possessing any cryptocurrency is if they see it as an *technology* investment not a trading investment. There is great promise with crypto and future of money, but what most people are doing in this sub is not contributing to it. Not surprisingly, most of this sub is sharing memes and shitposts, rather than have any valuable discussion of technology.
I do not possess any crypto, because I do not have the in-depth knowledge to appreciate its technology. Beyond the analogy of a "public digital ledger", I don't know much about Blockchain even. As a trader, I stay away from crypto.
If you want to own it for the long run, you should know *why* you want it? Is it because of the hype, or do you truly understand the technology of digital currency and its impact on future economy? The anonymity (or pseudonymity) factor of crypto is something that governments would never accept. But that is one motivating factor for people adopting crypto! In the end, the representative of the majority, the government, inevitably wins. Without a centralised institution backing it,  without any regulation, crypto is bound to have these insane swings in value.
