You gotta throw the public a bone once in a while. And today's journalism is superficial so it's a win-win so long as they can nail someone as the scapegoat.

gr8 b8 m8. Host OS has nothing to do with it, once you boot to Tails. Could be OSX/Linux/Windows. No idea what you're trying to sell.

Electrum uses 12 words, 24 words is twice as many to memorize.

well I'm certainly only running Tails on my own PC and hardware not a public kiosk or library so there's that.

Isn't that something that Apple is banking on? They don't want you to feel like your spending money when shopping so you buy more? Hasn't that been the trend with credit cards and teens and now Apple Pay?

What happens when the Trezor breaks, I mean hardware can malfunction. How do you retrieve the keys then? How is it better than Electrum's 12 words opened on a [Tails Distro](
