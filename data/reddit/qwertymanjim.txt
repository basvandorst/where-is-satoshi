My maths is terrible, but I think that’s a change of 5-6%? 
That’s nothing. One day you’re gonna wake up and the change will be 30-50%, or even greater.

Bet they had a load of fun for that $100 though
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:53:29
Yes, so that person’s bitcoin ride cost them $100. 
I’m saying they would have had loads of fun for that $100.

It may dip after the fork, but then it’s going to keep rising ***to the moon***

Coinbase is an exchange. Whilst the BTC are technically yours, coinbase holds the private key for the coins. 
A wallet gives you your private key to control. I’d suggest either set up a mobile wallet, (breadwallet is decent) or get a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger/nano. 
Edit: check the sidebar / subreddit info, and read through the ‘getting started and FAQ sections.

Adds are based on your browsing history. 
If the point of this post is that BTC is not in fact skyrocketing right now, (far from it)...well they don’t make new adverts every day, instead, instagram or any other company will have loads of adverts available, and they show each user the ones most applicable to them. 
This post is pointless

Where is your BTC stored? Don’t leave it in an exchange like coinbase. Put it in a wallet

It will give you a mnemonic passphrase, a string of words, which you just write down and keep safe. These words are what will give you access to your wallet in the future, if you get a new phone or lose /break yours.
**you can set yourself a password, but this will not be all you need**. Write down the words (Not in your phone). And keep them safe. Keep one copy in your lockbox / safe, and another copy somewhere else in your home, so you can access the wallet in the future. 
If you lose the mnemonic, and BTC reaches $50,000 in 5 years, you will have no way to access your coins

You are assuming that both BTC and Segwit2x will have the same value. 
They won’t. 
If you have 10 BTC, and 10 Segwit2x equated to the value of 0.1 BTC, you can sell it and have a total of 10.1 BTC

Isn't coinbase following the fork in November and moving away from BTC? I'm very unknowledgeable in all this, just along for the ride (and enjoying) but I read a thread a week or so back saying to move BTC out of coinbase as in November they may be changed to a different coin? 
Is Bittrex a safe place to keep my (not even 1 total) coins?

I'm looking at Bread or Exodus as options that have been mentioned in this thread. I've heard GreenAddress is good too...?
I assume that later on I'll be able to transfer over to a Ledger Nano S....probably going to get one of those in the new year, so just looking at an interim measure.

Bread is good then

Bread and GreenAddress have iOS apps too, whereas Exodus doesn't seem to...
