Me too! I was all like "hey wolfram - alpha, don't you know what a BitCoin is??"  and they were all "oh man we should get on that" and so they did.

Yaay it's Tuesday

What a waste of black ink (and page space). Was the content really so lacking that they had to cover most of the front page with a giant picture of a wallet?

I suppose I should have used /s.  My point was that giving stolen goods to someone else does nothing for those originally offended. I know of Kant :) 
@_date: 2012-09-08 22:39:57
So, if I make one (1) baby for every one (1) person I kill, does that balance out?
@_date: 2012-09-08 22:37:53
Why would you report money you created in a foreign currency? 
@_date: 2012-09-08 22:41:46
1. Make malware. 
2. Offer services to remove malware. 
3. ??? 
4. Profit. 
@_date: 2012-09-08 22:42:59
Sad but true. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:48:34
but won't anyone who donates to that get arrested too...? 
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:55:53
whoa and pass inheritance down to their children via memorized money chants....
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:28:48
You wouldn't download money!! 
Yes I would. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:13:50
This almost makes sense
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:54:30
Why is the symbol an inverted pyramid containing the all-seeing eye? 
@_date: 2013-10-24 19:38:42
Maybe I should clarify: I speak English, and I'm a Bitcoin believer. I was making a slightly humorous tongue-in-cheek remark to elicit something that resembles a smile on your face.
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:57:57
Quick Charlie, choose a button! 
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:48:29
Does anyone else feel like this is a strange dream? The whole concept of Bitcoin is so far out there but so nifty, I'm waiting for my alarm to wake me up and ruin it all. 
@_date: 2013-02-26 17:02:57
Can't we just hire the Transporter? 
EDIT: seriously though, why do we need another middleman when we could just make arrangements with a privacy-minded shipping/transportation group? 
@_date: 2013-09-17 12:45:25
This comment has me convinced you are a Khajiit.
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:31:31
This really is a religion, isn't it.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:04:32
But you'd be paying them for services rendered at that point, right? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:31:21
Your real name is Abdada? What country are you from? 
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:56:03
But freedom is a wise man's currency! Or something like that... 
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:31:49
Events proceeding differently is part of the plan... 
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:06:23
Oh man I can't stop laughing 
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:43:46
This is a non-answer. My question relates to the fact that the All-Seeing Eye or Eye of Horus is a symbol commonly used by the US government. Why would you want that as your icon when your purpose is to subvert or circumvent their control? 
@_date: 2013-03-27 06:17:43


Considering the speed at which BTC and technology in general are growing, I would say so. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:48:08
What if a shared key was announced over the radio? I'm obviously out of my depth hehe
@_date: 2013-09-17 12:47:36
Whoa you just blew my mind- in the future, "coins" (like BTC) will only have one side.
@_date: 2013-06-01 23:13:18
I think it has a tumor...
@_date: 2013-01-27 09:23:16
Y u no update?? 
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:34:04
...or were there? 
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:47:15
...just not as awesome as Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:36:33
Easy fix- keep $5 extra in that account as a buffer. Beats paying $25 for not having one. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:57:42
Indeed. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 21:18:57
But he was really serious about it.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:41:18
Wait wait you might have something here - if we can use known adoption rates as determined by psychological constants, we can extrapolate the price point at any given time, then set up an automatic program to buy and sell based on the predicted highs and lows, efficiently milking the market for all it's worth, creating a standard for investing in the process! Then we'll get murdered by someone who doesn't want us to see the future.
EDIT: I would watch this movie.
