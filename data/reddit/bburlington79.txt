When people give me crap I tell them I bought in at $200 and these dips get me excited. Every ath has followed a "bubble burst". Ignorant people are everywhere and have a strong opinion on most things. I don't let it ruffle my feathers much. As a grizzled BTC holder I know how the game is played.

True. Holding also reduces the amount of sell pressure on exchanges. Holding is good, using BTC to buy things while promoting adoption is better. As it becomes easier and easier to convert BTC from FIAT we should all be focusing on spending our BTC over HODL
@_date: 2014-10-20 20:10:44
Thing that scares me is that this introduces tainted coins into the market place. If enough exchanges or vendors have lists of coins they won't associate with than you now have to be careful which BTC you accept yourself.
What happens when a trusting vendor without these restrictions accepts BTC which is not blacklisted and they cannot exchange it? It creates mistrust in the system. 
Are we going to end up with "Bad" coins?

It's nice to see something like this on the sub. 
It would be nice to open up the sub a bit more to other related talk!
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:49:08
Agreed. We need more wide spread use and without a middleman I suppose as a buyer you need to have a certain amount of trust towards a seller. This can be difficult when as a new user of BTC you also need to impart a level of trust to the coin as well. 
Not too different form when CC were used online at first. I suppose you could use Escrow but that kind of kills the point. I'm sure someone will figure out a better way soon enough.
@_date: 2014-09-30 04:32:11
It's traded on different exchanges and it's a pure supply and demand pairing resulting in the current price.
There are any number of reasons the price fluctuates.

There are some coins focused on making sure mining is done by GPU. It was only a matter of time until ASIC manufacturers decided to not only "test" their products for the most profitable time frame but now rather just cut the end user out all together. 
I support a few coins, BTC, and alts which can afford to be more progressive. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 08:09:33
That could change soon enough with some higher profile coins running into trouble. I spread my investing / mining around. BTC is the father of CC and without it's hard work and infrastructure there would be no block chain or crypto currencies. However we must be ever vigilant not to become too complacent. Centralization is a threat. 
Diversifying your investments into coins that can adapt faster and can test new features is not a bad bet. I own BTC, VTC, and DRK.

You may not have dealt with Paypal much...
They do nothing almost nothing to protect a seller. Everything is buyer protection related. If a fraudster buyer knows his/her paypal loopholes they can defraud sellers with minimal effort. 
Not to mention the amount of work which is involved in fighting a fraud case.
I speak from experience as a gold seller on the bay for over 3 years. At one point I just couldn't deal with all the BS anymore.

The same can be said about any group cemented in their beliefs. Those who generally are can't see the forest through the trees. 
I sub to both r/bitcoin and r/btc attempting to get a full picture. Dismissing either side is usually anti productive. I look forward to a solution that best fits the needs of all those involved. Not an easy task, I don't envy those trying right now. To have consensus.... One can hope.
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:22:47
Agreed. Anyone interested in learning about Bitcoin will take one look at /bitcoin or r/btc and leave the subs in a hurry. Nothing but hostility and doubt. As much as any group or individual trumpets their firm unequivocal views, most unable to see the other sides perspective, the inner world of Bitcoin is a disaster right now. 
It's a hostile environment and not everyone want's to wade through it. If you do get pulled in and are sick of the status quo I can see how you would exit after you reached your limit. 
I just wish we could have a compromise. Each side gives up something to get something. 
If you think your solution is already a compromise it's not enough.
The part that kills me is the double talk and 180's that come about.

I can understand attacks from other coins. The part that is a constant disappointment to me is that most of the attacks are from within. It's hard to push something forward when it's being pulled apart from within. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:53:00
I think you may be. Cutting off the nose to spite your face. I always find it disappointing that there is the need to attack. Crypto in general can be better supported by those trying to find compromise and common ground. I was happy the NYA was resolved. it really seemed the like perfect mix of what either side wanted. I really wish we could focus on something other than attacking.

You've been waiting with your finger on the trigger to post this. Well done. To the moon!

It's interesting that ASICs were a strength in the past when they made every other type of mining equipment obsolete and now when a few players own the majority of them they've become bad. So many different aspects of the road map and technology are doing 180s these days. They invested the money and brought hashing power to the network. Have invested a crazy amount of money and have followed the rules as they were set out. Changing the POW method is not the answer. Figuring out how to compromise is. Both sides need to give up more than they're willing to at the moment. Moving the goal posts every time something doesn't go your way is not the answer.
I'm entirely certain that if/when a POW change is on the horizon we'll start to hear how hard forks really aren't that bad of a thing.

Nothing is certain. I'm just expressing how I've handled the ups and down thus far and have come out on top. To each their own. It is a risk but as time passes and adoption increases the risk is reduced.
Who's to say gold wont reach $0, or the greenback or anything else. Technically it all could. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 14:42:35
Agreed. This could be a clear headed debate but it remains a crapshow from extremists on both sides that refuse to even consider an outside argument. I keep hoping that both sides with coalesce and make bitcoin that much stronger. Instead we continue to fracture.
For Core there is no compromise, ever. That's a problem. I very much appreciate the work they do after Bitcoins inception. We however deserve a free speaking, compromising environment. It's not us and them. It's just us.  
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:04:28
Just make sure you have tracking and a signature and proof of the item. In some cases a pick of you packing it up. Very overkill but if your bases covered you should be protected as much as you can be. Also add true value insurance to the shipment. 
All this being said eBay is all about the buyers. It's increasingly hard to sell there. It's not to difficult to scam the system. You're just taking calculated risks.
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:39:29
If you're talking about the potential danger of the act of a hard fork itself I don't think can you really have levels of danger.  It either is or isn't dangerous. How controversial it is makes shouldn't make a difference. They will have to hard fork if the vast majority of hashing power is branched off. 
Developers and miners need to be on the same page. The only side I've seen willing to compromise thus far are the miners. On this site we're willing to hard fork not to hard fork. We're against code changes that are not tested/vetted well enough but do not test or vet the code. We're against the miners having too much power so we want to change things to USAF. We are both for ASICs strengthening the hash rate and against it because evil China. 
Honestly I just want all the drama to die down so we can focus on making Bitcoin stronger rather than ripping it apart. I have seen basically how every change  / argument is absolutely terrible UNLESS it's done by Core than it's ok. 
Any centralized group that has too much influence over Bitcoin can be a problem. This includes Miners, Government and yes even Core.
I think of it this way. We have miners that want a very simple change to 2mb.
Blockchain bloat? Don't see it as an issue. Technology and hardware have increased more than enough in the last 7 years to more than cover 1mb -&gt; 2mb. 
Hardfork? Going to happen either way. 
Code? If we're serious about joining this community together between the two teams we can have everything reviewed. If we want to add new features to the code it doesn't matter if it's 1 or 2mb in size. Everything that can be done to 1mb can be done to 2mb. 
As far as firing the Core developers? Are you saying that any change made that is adopted that Core didn't make is actively firing the team? Does this mean that Core are the only people that can make changes? Does that not make our code base 100% centralized? 
We can choose to vilify these changes or ask Core to compromise just a bit. I'd love to read either sub and see 0 threads attacking. Think about how much more room you'd have to promote.

Keep buying at different levels. I bought at $200, $1000, $300 and just played the long game. If I sold at any point I'd be out a lot of money right now.
In BTC you will always have your wild swings. Don't play the short game. Play the long game. Just buy in a different levels and you'll be on top in the end. If you're selling at a loss right now you really have no one to blame but yourself when it goes back up again.
This is not the first, nor will it be the last, piece of news that fluctuates value wildly. Stay calm and enjoy the ride.

See this is the part I don't understand. The hard fork would happen one way or another correct? Either the hard fork to Segwit2x or once the spit occurs a hard fork to a new pow algorithm.
Hard forks are not the boogyman as long as it's done responsibly. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:18:00
Everything said here is 100% valid. Well said. There's never a need to attack the other side. Ideally we find common ground. Stop spending all your energy trying to break down the other side and focus your efforts on yours!
