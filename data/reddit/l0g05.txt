Looks like it.  As of yesterday, my current account balance is negative.  My 22 GHash are now worth only .5113 BTC while I've mined only .2746 BTC to date.  
So as of now my 1 BTC investment is now worth .7859 BTC.  I had a few moments 10 days ago where my net-net would have been positive, but it seems unlikely that I'll recover from here.
Its a 1 BTC experiment, but I've always preferred empirical evidence over theory.

She is making an argument based on current constitutional principles.  And a clever one.  Rothbard is not a constitutional scholar.

I went ahead and just ran an experiment.  
Put in 1 BTC and bought 22 GH/S.  
At peak, if i sold back all of my GH/S and added my mined BTC to the total, I had 1.12 BTC.  Right now, because the price of GH/S has dropped, I'm just barely above water (.044BTC).   
I'm going to let it run all the way through to when/if my mining total is &gt; than 1 BTC and see.

This is an interesting problem.  Is this a topological weakness of BTC?  i.e., what good economic reason would there be for someone to come along and *compete* with the Ghash pool?  If the mining market naturally collapses into 1 major winner (with &gt;51% of the market) then that is a fail scenario.

I'm headed to Croatia in July.  Anyone know of places that accept btc?

Richard is very interested in bitcoin, but this sort of thing is common at Necker.  He can swing by and take a look without having to spend much time, energy or social capital.

Mark.   I too was on MtGox on the early days and lost hundreds of BTC.   For my part,  you are forgiven.   
My suggestion is to endeavor to use these resources as a sort of crypto commons.   There is a lot of good work that could be done building infrastructure (likely in the form of DAOs) that are of general value.   For example,  a Cybersecurity DAO would be of enormous value and is the sort of thing that you could seed.
