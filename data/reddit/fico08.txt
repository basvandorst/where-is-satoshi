lol what!? This guy must really have been stupid.  Even today mining profits are no worse than they were 3 weeks ago.  You don't just "buy" a mining rig.  You buy parts and assemble, or ASICs.

It's a localized bubble.  Housing?  Dotcom? Involved TRILLIONS.  We haven't gotten there.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:29:47
So? It was never bigger than Apple.  The entire cryptocurrency market at one point was worth as much as maybe one large company?  So what?  Do you have any idea the size of markets  dealing in traditional asset  classes?  That's where we'll end up.

I have both and the Ledger is superior.

Why trade on Bittrex without FIRST verifying an account and ensuring you’ll be able to withdraw?
I’ve done this 3 times! It isn’t hard.

Lol, meant to say Ledger.

People are upset?! 5 minutes of research could have told them this.  
The proper phrase would be that people are fucking stupid and lazy.
They should not be investing in things with 0 research.

Seriously?  Just as futures legitimize the space, paving the way for millions and millions of people to start buying?  You messed up man.  Could have sold them next year for roughly 2x as much $.  Probably more.

Big mistake.  Should have bought a Ledger.  Cheaper, better.  I have both so I’m allowed to say that.  Completely unbiased.

This is unacceptable, not sure where you guys are moving your funds, but I am trying to make time sensitive trades, I had wired funds in at 10 AM - and am usually credited within 4 hours.  it took nearly 12, and now I am unable to withdraw.

Where I come from - we call mansions houses.
I don't remember even when that comment was - if it was during the China dump in the summer, people were scrambling to sell, and I was buying.  What of it?
in 2014 I was completely unaware of ETH.  Not sure why it is so hard for you to believe that one may have bought BTC, and then left cryptocurrency markets for several years.  That's what I did.  Did I earn much from BTC bought in those days?  No.  I didn't claim to have.
I'm aware of my own comment history - I'm not a liar so you'll fail to find evidence of me contradicting myself.
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:50:44
I don't recall any comments mentioning my purchase of BTC on reddit, but considering I've been buying/selling any number of assets this year, most of which require you to trade against BTC, I would not be surprised if you found evidence that I bought recently.
Doesn't mean I also didn't buy back then - which I did [apparently you didn't look far enough](
New to this - referencing daily research and trading of crypto-assets.
Anyway, when the market is worth 800 Billion or more before the end of the month, remember that I said it here.
Anyway, you strike me very much as a troll.  I don't believe a successful, well educated, dyslexic  reader of peer-reviewed journals would spend his time accosting strangers on the internet.

I didn't own any bitcoin until after that fork had occurred, but assuming there will be one - potentially that could be a good move?

House = mansion, both buildings you live in.  Interchangeable.
Why would I consider a “nice house” bought from market gains if t weren’t $5,000,000+ mansion?
Anyway, I've got nothing to prove, so not quite sure why I didn't end this conversation a while ago.
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:19:58
You don't know shit, and neither do your loser peer reviewed journalists.  If you think hiding behind a degree and the "Journal of Monetary Economics" makes you credible - it doesn't.  There is nothing in the long term history of bitcoin price data that indicates what the price will be a year from now.  It's fallen far more significantly in past crashes, and rebounded ever still to 20k - your analysis is total garbage.
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:03:31
Pretty good, but I'm in the "Bought a lot of BTC in the last 2 days club"
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:35:57
I know what a peer reviewed journal is - I just don't care.  You certainly didn't learn human interaction at your university, take a look at your comments and gauge how effective they were considering you accosted nearly everyone who approached you in discussion.
It was precisely that sort of behavior that caused me to dismiss you and your ideas (or should I say - the Journal's ideas) completely.
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:03:40
Got mine on Amazon, no problem.  Less than a week.  Why invest at all if you aren't expecting your investment to grow? If you can't protect your assets, it was all for nothing.  Consider the price of a hardware wallet part of your initial investment.  Or - use a paper wallet.  For short term holding, I suppose official desktop wallets are fine, but if you aren't planning on trading semi-regularly, offline wallet 100%.
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:08:54
Thanks, that helps.  You think it'd be a good move to consolidate my assets into Bitcoin ahead of the fork, in order to end up with more hardfork coins?
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:31:56
I'm very confused by your post... what do you mean Bitcoin cash is trading 9 to 1?  Seems to me it's value has been trending down.
Also, what is Bitcoin Gold???  What's going on here? Incredibly confused.
When I buy BTC on GDAX, or Bittrex, etc.  what am I buying ?
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:36:08
Would anyone advise me to trade out of my other positions and go 100% Bitcoin in order to get an equal amount after the fork?  Then re-enter my other positions with 100% gain in the new BTC?
This is the first time I will have held any coins during a hard fork, so I am unsure of the implications.
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:31:43
I still don’t see the advantage.  Buying limits are very low, and transfer times are very long (plus require monthly fee).
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:30:17
What the hell is a 2x coin?

Everything I've heard suggests it sucks, no?

Good to know - I'm starting to feel that steering clear of BTC all together would be good in the short term.
What are your thoughts on BCH?

Why is it goodbye Coinbase exactly?
@_date: 2018-07-26 17:35:35
The cryptocurrency market is a global financial market... NASDAQ and NYSE are both global financial markets...  that was the comparison.
BTC as a stand-alone asset traded in global financial markets, was being compared to Facebook... a stand-alone asset traded in global financial markets...  where’s the disconnect...
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:05:31
When I used BTC in 2014, it was all held in anonymous accounts, where a wallet was never necessary.  Segwit2x was non-existent.  
I am well versed in PGP encryption, and transacting in BTC.  The questions I was asking had to do with hardware wallets (which again, did not exist) and running full nodes (which I had never done).  
I have since moved on from those topics.
Besides, there are many examples of people claiming to have bought BTC years ago and forgotten.  I did not claim to have made millions in Cryptocurrency, but I can tell you I am well situated despite that.  
Anything else?  
@_date: 2018-07-26 17:32:19
You guys can believe whatever you want.  Gold is a $7T dollar asset.  BTC should have no problem attaining such levels in time.  Your side business is not a global financial market, so of course that’s a stupid comparison.   If you don’t think it’s valid to contrast valuations of public companies traded on the stock market against assets traded in the cryptocurrency market, that’s great.  Doesn’t change the fact that it is a more than valid comparison.
Quite frankly you should have no ownership of any of these assets if you can’t understand these basic principles.
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:12:58
Ultimately I was dismissing the first comment’s assertion that the post had nothing to do around crypto.
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:21:43
There’s nothing hard to follow about what I said.
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:15:20
It is - and I didn’t post the article, so don’t take it up with me.
@_date: 2018-07-26 17:40:05
If a single company can be valued so greatly, there’s no reason a revolutionary finite asset such as BTC should fail to attain and surpass such valuations.  It’s that simple.  Just proof of how young this market is.  If you don’t see that as evidence, no one can help you.
@_date: 2018-07-26 20:22:02
Because a direct contrast between BTC’s present value, and Facebook’s present value was being drawn.  It’s a great conversation starter concerning the future of BTC’s value.  I don’t see why such conversation would be discouraged. 
That’s the last I’m going to say.
@_date: 2018-07-29 23:31:09
(Also I did not know that, oh well)
Cheers for being a good sport.  I suppose it didn’t have much reason to be posted.  My stance was that there’s no reason that the value of BTC shouldn’t be compared to the value of FB.  It will be worth much more in time.
@_date: 2018-07-08 17:04:29
Lol, months of planning 
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:54:45
Yeah... comparing two asset classes is just like comparing a country to a satellite object....
Totally false.
It’s no different than comparing the NASDAQ to the NYSE.
Just because it’s small now doesn’t mean it will be forever.  In fact, this market is pretty correlated to the early NASDAQ, which was also highly correlated to earlier market movements.
We are in the earliest stages of the evolution a new market.  Drawing parallels to more established markets is precisely what we should be doing.  More or less, they all share a similar beginning pattern.
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:55:01
Again - the context of the comparison served to highlight just how small BTC (and the rest of the market) currently is.  Take that as you will.  Adios.
@_date: 2018-07-28 00:27:48
Lol, last one was just kind of a joke
Was expecting you to reply “No”, after which I’d have replied “N”
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:06:28
I’m drawing conclusions rooted firmly in logic, knowledge of institutional/VC happenings in the space, and yes - person belief.
Feel free to disagree, but to consider my words to be “certifiably bullshit” is just false.  There is no reason whatsoever not to compare the crypto-asset class to other asset classes when examining prospective future market capitalization.  I’m not sitting here talking about “NEO Earnings per share...” THAT would be a foolish comparison.  We’re strictly comparing one company’s valuation to that of the entire cryptocurrency market and suggesting the disparity as evidence there is much greater growth to be experienced.

Lol- where are the 32 people who upvoted the other guy! I’m just agreeing here!
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:43:05
If you guys don’t see how such news is applicable to the cryptocurrency asset class, you need to remove your blinders.. no shit they’re different asset classes...  the point is that the marketcap of a SINGLE company has been hit by nearly the ENTIRE BTC marketcap, as well as HALF of the market as a WHOLE.
If anything, in the long term cryptoassets - as they will be valued much differently than central entities (used globally, and in many cases without the need of a central entity whatsoever, the value dispersed across all participants of an ecosystem), the contrast drawn against Facebook’s value decline is further supporting evidence of just how incredibly young this new market is - and how far we have to go.  We truly haven’t seen anything yet.

I don't get it, I see no reason to take fewer precautions in protecting my assets, whether I'm holding large balances, or small balances.  iOS Wallets?  That's asking for a problem in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:55:00
It shouldn't be a piece of cake to gain access to the contents of your wallet.  Not even for you.  I disagree with that mentality.  A hardware wallet/paper wallet is the only real long term secure solution.  It may seem like a lot of effort for a few hundred dollars, but if you aren't expecting the price to grow then why are you investing?  I don't think you'd be as inclined to put your faith in an iPhone App that could cease development at a moment's notice when you're dealing with $10,000+
