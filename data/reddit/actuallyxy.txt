I just saw your edit. Each set of words is a wallet seed. When entered into a bitcoin wallet, it will give you full control over a set of addresses and their bitcoins.  
Presumably every seed you have gives access to the the bitcoins in the public address above it. If that's the case, you are sitting on almost $400,000 at the current bitcoin price.  
The first thing you should do is take the computer where you have this file offline, and make a security backup on a usb stick or two, but keep all of those offline too.  
Next, I would buy a Trezor hardware wallet and transfer all the bitcoins there to make sure they are safe.

You could submit your transaction to [ViaBTC transaction accelerator]( It seems to work well.  
Just ignore their propaganda for BU. They run their accelerator as a shameless canvassing tool.

If you have more than a handful of bitcoins I would urge you to invest some money in a hardware wallet, either a Trezor or a Ledger Nano S. They are quite foolproof. Paper wallets, on the other hand, are riddled with pitfalls.  
If you decide to use a paper wallet, make sure you create it in an offline computer that will never again be connected to the internet. Or at the very least in an offline computer booting off a live Linux USB.  
Also, when you retrieve the bitcoins from your paper wallet, make sure you sweep them into your wallet rather than import them, because it is a lot safer. If you then want to store them again, you have to create a new paper wallet. Every paper wallet can be used once only.  
If you decide to go the paper wallet route, do make sure to read a lot about it, and know exactly what you are doing, because it's easy to fuck up.

OK. Then I would reiterate some of the good advice you've had in this thread:  
* Make sure you are on solid legal footing when taking possession of his bitcoins.  
* If you manage to get hold of a significant amount of bitcoins, buy a hardware wallet (like a Trezor or a Ledger Nano S) to store them safely until you decide what to do next.  
* Be very wary of giving out too much information about any of this either in person or online. Anybody who gets hold of a private key owns those bitcoins. Hackers or criminals may target you if they can identify you from the information you provide online.  
* It's unlikely you'll be able to bruteforce any files.  
* You may be able to find paper backups of bitcoin addresses/wallets. These may take the form of wallet seeds (a set of 12, 18 or 24 unrelated words) or private keys (a long string of random-looking letters and numbers).

I hope for your own sake that you are trolling.  
There is no guarantee at all that Bitcoin's price will keep increasing indefinitely. It may crash suddenly if there is a catastrophic bug, if World governments make a concerted effort to ban it, or if the current scaling standoff ends up in disaster.  
If you are going to invest a significant amount anyway, I have two pieces of advice for you:  
Buy a Trezor hardware wallet and keep your bitcoins there. You sound far too clueless to keep it safe in any other way.  
Prepare yourself mentally for the possibility of a crash in price. If the price suddenly crashed down to $50, would you panic and sell, or be excited that you can buy more cheap bitcoins? If the former, rethink your investment. The price has crashed several times already.
@_date: 2017-02-18 10:06:11
If your brother was as cryptography savvy as you imply, I doubt anybody will ever be able to bruteforce his encrypted file.  
Also your brother's death was not unexpected. If he intended for you to have his bitcoins after his demise, why didn't he make any provisions for that to happen?

If you need the transactions to go through sooner, there are a couple of things you can try.  
You could try submitting your transaction to ViaBTC transaction accelerator:  
Or you could try sending the whole contents of your wallet to yourself with a really big fee. This works by applying the Child Pays for Parent feature, but it has the downside of compromising your privacy by linking together all your bitcoin addresses.

@_date: 2016-03-10 09:33:18
It's happened to me too. After 15 minutes, they cancelled the transaction despite the fact that the bitcoin had been transferred with 3 confirmations.  
It was only like $10 for a Humble Bundle, so I couldn't be bothered to claim it back.
@_date: 2017-02-19 00:05:23
No. every time you receive bitcoin into an address, mycellium will automaticly generate a new address for you, with a new QR code.  
If somebody sends bitcoin to one of your old addresses it's ok, you'll still get it.  
But it's better to use a new address for every transaction. Better privacy.

Many exchanges have been hacked or collapsed instantly. Many of them appeared very legitimate until they went down.  
Also, every time that the price properly crashed, it was all so sudden that the exchanges got overwhelmed with sell orders. I wouldn't count on being able to offload your coins in time even if you have them in the exchange.  
Overall, I think you are better off putting an amount of money in bitcoin that you accept you may lose, and securing it with a paper wallet (if you are really confident you know what you are doing) or a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-02 18:17:00
Exactly. They can also do a runner on you and disappear with your money. Or they can freeze your account because they have decided to tighten their regulations, or because your bitcoins have been linked with suspicious activity (even if it's nothing to do with you).  
If an exchange loses your money, there's no insurance or customer protection - you're screwed.

Trezor Manager app for android is also very user friendly. With the Trezor Manager app for setup and then Mycellium for subsequent use, you don't even need a desktop computer to use your Trezor.

I'm not an expert, but I think you can use the feature called Child-pays-for-Parent.  
Send the bitcoins from the address where you sent them too another address you control, this time with an appropriately high fee.  
Your initial transaction will get confirmed along with the new one.

Bitcoin does not care about borders. It doesn't make any difference to send internationally or within a country.  
Do consider whether you need to exchange currencies at either end, though. If so, you need to find credible exchanges and take into account their fees and their exchange rates. If you need to exchange at both ends it may not turn out to be a cheap option.
Other than that, you need to watch out for the usual things as with any bitcoin transaction. Make sure both of you know a bit about how bitcoin works, have chosen a secure wallet, manage you passwords/keys securely, send your transaction with a fee, realise that transactions are irreversible, etc. But those things apply to all transactions, regardless of borders.

[Onecoiners getting ready to fly to the moon](  
Seriously, though, if you search "Onecoin" on Google, half the links on the first page explain why it is a scam. If your friend has decided to invest despite this information being so readily available, maybe he is just too stupid to be helped.  
Cryptocurrency is a complex topic. If you want to find out more, start at the r/bitcoin sidebar.  
 is a legit site. It's a Bitcoin blockchain explorer and wallet.  
As you astutely noticed,  does not list Onecoin. Actually,  is the only website that lists it. This is a fake site created by Onecoin themselves.  
The hallmark of real cryptocurrencies is that they are open source software that anyone can download, scrutinise and run. You can mine bitcoins yourself if you want to (although i wouldn't recommend it to you because bitcoin mining has become a very competitive business, and you'll almost certainly lose money in electricity and hardware). You can download a bitcoin wallet into your phone right now and receive and send bitcoins to anyone without restriction. Many merchants accept bitcoin right now for goods and services. You can freely buy and sell them in dozens of exchanges. Nobody knows what the future holds for bitcoin, but there is no doubt that it is real money with real value.  
Now contrast this with Onecoin. They claim to have created a better cryptocurrency, but there is no software to show for it. They talk about mining, but you have no access to any mining hardware or software, they do their mining behind closed doors. There are "tokens", but you don't own them in your own wallet in your phone or computer, the company holds them for you. Furthermore, nobody accepts them in exchange for anything. Their supposed value is a quote in a fake website created by Onecoin themselves. Good luck selling them. Also, when you buy the tokens, actually they are selling you an "educational package", and the tokens are merely an addition. This is clearly to protect themselves from future legal action, when the whole thing eventually blows up.

Generate a wallet with mycellium. Write down your seed. Send $1 to your wallet. Open electrum. Restore your wallet by entering your seed. Check that you have access to your $1.

Experienced bitcoiners will warn you against keeping bitcoin in exchanges because they've seen many exchanges get hacked or go bankrupt, and anybody who had bitcoins there just lost them.  
You'll probably be all right leaving your bitcoins in Coinbase for a week or two, because it would be very unlucky for Coinbase to go bust in those two weeks. At least set up 2 factor authentication.  
The recommendations you've had for mycelium/breadwallet/electrum are sound. You can download them all and see which one you like better. The 'Bitcoin Wallet' from 'Bitcoin Wallet developers' on android is also good. Whichever one you use, think how you are going to store the seed safely.  
If you are planning to buy much more than $1000-2000, it may be worth spending $100 on a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger Nano S for better security.
@_date: 2017-05-01 02:47:00
Also when you need the bitcoins in a paper wallet, remember to always sweep your funds into your wallet rather than importing the address or trying to spend directly from your paper wallet address. Those are easy ways to lose your bitcoin.

Encrypting with PGP is not hard. The option "--symmetric" represents the command to encrypt using symmetric rather than asymmetric encryption. Google it. Two problems with this approach. First, entering your unencrypted seed into a computer to encrypt it may represent a security problem unless you are very careful. Second, you'll end up with an encrypted file which can't easily be kept as a paper wallet.  
Splitting a seed in two halves and keeping them in two separate locations is actually a decent low-tech option. If the seed is 24 words, no one can do anything with half the seed.  
The most elegant option is probably to generate a seed with a passphrase. The passphrase acts as an additional word of your own choice that is needed to unlock the funds. You can use electrum or trezor (and I'm sure there are other options) to do this. You can add a passphrase to an existing seed, but you would have to move your funds to the new wallet generated by the seed plus the passphrase. You are not altering the seed by adding a passphase. Every seed has an infinite set of possible wallets that can be generated by adding different passphrases to it.
@_date: 2016-07-20 08:24:42
Say I want to make some free money.  
All I have to do is write a little script that calculates SHA256 of all sort of common words and word combinations from a dictionary and sweeps the resulting bitcoin addresses into my address. This can be very efficient, because I am able to bruteforce all existing brainwallets simultaneously.  
Unfortunately quite a few people are doing precisely that.  
That's why brainwallets are very unsecure, and definitely a worse idea than encrypting your private key.
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:36:13
Buy a cheap android phone. Install mycelium. Transfer the bitcoins to the mycelium wallet. Do all this in front of you buyer so he can see that you don't have a copy of the seed.  
Now sell him the phone with all its contents, including bitcoins.  
Does this work for you?  
Anyway, I doubt it makes any difference at all from a legal standpoint.
@_date: 2017-06-11 09:19:17
It's ok for the pin. It's not so great if you have to restore the seed (your computer will know the words, just not their order). It's really bad if you set a passphase - you just have to enter it in you computer/phone.  
Ledger Nano S have come up with a clever way to enter your seed with just the two buttons. Entering your passphrase with 2 buttons is a bit of a pain, but much better than entering it in your computer. If you are really paranoid you can restore your seed/passphrase with the Nano S plugged to a phone charger - not even connected to a computer or phone.  
One more thing I like about it is that it looks very much like a USB stick when closed - much more discrete to take though airports and the like.  
I bought my Nano S thinking it would be inferior to the Trezor, but that it would be useful to store altcoins. After trying it, I prefer it to the Trezor.
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:30:08
Trezor is the most stablished reputable model. It's good.  
I actually prefer Ledger Nano S for three reasons - it's cheaper, it has much better altcoin support, and it allows you to enter all inputs in the device itself (with Trezor you have to use the keyboard of your computer or phone, which is less secure).  
Either of those two is a great choice. I wouldn't bother with the cheaper Ledger Nano models without a screen (less secure) or with the Ledger Nano Blue (very expensive). Of course, there's a new Trezor 2 model coming out soon, so we'll see what that's like.
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:02:12
I'm glad to hear that there have been no issues at airports. There have been reports of travellers being detained by border agents until they agreed to unlock their encrypted devices, though. I'd rather be discreet.  
Nice work on the advanced recovery. Thanks for letting me know about this relatively new feature. I hope it will be possible to use it to enter your passphrase too. No need to have a go at one of your customers.
