Do you people still not believe me and make jokes look at how its systemically timing the drops and the entire Market goes down together it's almost like a large group has their finger on the button on the timing too went to tank the market it could be Bots even but this whole thing seems totally rigged

How have the fundamentals changed in 2 weeks your point is totally invalid

These are time to systemic drops this isn't some kind of South korea-based band type of Crash this is very systemic to cash out and reenter at some position

LET ME START THIS BY SAYING OWN ANY COIN JUST DO NOT GO INTO TETHER.
Towards the end of 2017 one thought that kept crossing my mind was "why are the green candles just popping up at random times and on random coins everyday?" it just didn't make sense that everyone would get together at a certain time an pump a coin.
Today I think we have the answer to that very question.
The scam coin "TETHER"... Researching this today has blown my mind and puts into clarity a lot of the confusion I had about how the market was just flying and or dumping at the most random of times almost robot like.
The thoery and what I believe to be the truth is out! Tether was being created out of thin air and used to purchase altcoins and bitcoin all of last year. Bitfinex and the creators used it to buy up tons of alts and bitcoin and eventually cashed it out to take profits while the rest of us sit here wondering why the markt is crashing..
This crash is a result of price manipulation from bitfinex and tether.
