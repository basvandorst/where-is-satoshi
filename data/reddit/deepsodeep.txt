ELI5 what we're looking at?

Could you explain why they would do that? What's in it for them? Wouldn't it be more more profitable to just let the price go up?
@_date: 2017-02-25 16:41:46
I most definitely am confused, so thank you for the advice! I'll look into those software wallets and get one.
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:22:21
What's the advantage of using a hardware wallet like KeepKey vs encrypting and copying the wallet from a computer to a couple of regular USB keys safely stored?
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:58:55
Okay, thanks! So in terms of security I'd be just as good?
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:31:55
Yeah, can someone ELI5 this please? I have no clue what's going on with the fork and what it even means.. I just bought some BTC for long term storage, do I have to keep things in mind or take some action to account for BTU? 
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:51:05
Don't most people write down their 12 word recovery seed for the hardware wallet? So, aside from the security when actually doing transactions, the storage part seems just as vulnerable, no?

I hate to admit it but that's so me.. People have been so eager to tell me time and time again that it's all a useless bubble so now I really want to be able to return the "told you so".

ELI5 how the fuck exchanges ever went along with this? This seems to recreate one of the problems bitcoin was trying to solve/prevent..

I'm kinda interested as well, could you explain why Amazon really doesn't have any interest in it at all? Why wouldn't they just respond to customer demand? Maybe not tomorrow or next week, but is there a reason for them to completely ignore it?
@_date: 2018-02-25 09:56:38
Sure, that's possible. So the difficulty will rise, but only to a point where a block still gets mined every 10min, that's exactly the point of the difficulty adjustment algorhytm, so that means the last couple of blocks will take just about as long as all those before them.
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:33:01
What you're saying is true, but none of it explains why the last bitcoin would take longer or even can't be mined.
Whether a mined bitcoin is lost on a destroyed hard drive or safely stored in someone's wallet is completely irrelevant.

I had a very similar conversation yesterday. Funny how they never text you saying "lmao bitcoin prices are skyrocketing, up 20% this week alone :)"
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:27:21
Any reason why you believe this is different than the 40% dip from a month ago or the one(s) before? Sure, a correction will probably happen, as it has numerous times, but what makes you think *this* one specifically will be different and "epic"?
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:49:17


Why is that? It was my understanding that difficulty is determined by how fast the blocks are mined (maintaining the 1 block per 10 minutes rate), not how much bitcoins are mined/left. So assuming the amount of hash power stays roughly the same, there shouldn't be any difference between mining the 1000th bitcoin for example and mining the 21-millionth bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:32:28
But why? What specifically made you think "omg this is the one, we're going down to &lt;1000"? It just seems so incredibly random and based on nothing.. Is it because you want to be right? Taking wild guesses until one turns out to come true and you can say you told us so?
@_date: 2017-07-23 09:16:14
Thanks!  
Can you elaborate on the privacy part please? What does that mean?  
I'm withdrawing to paper to own my coins when aug 1 comes, but I've got a HW wallet on the way so it's only temporary. My exchange validation tier wasn't high enough to withdraw everything at once so I had to split. Can I run into trouble like this? 
@_date: 2017-06-17 15:26:50
Thanks a lot, looks like I found my solution. I'll look into the password encryption and then start printing! :)
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:55:28
Thanks for the suggestions!  
Just wondering why a paper wallet is preferred over a password encrypted USB drive? If someone gets a hold of the piece of paper is there any extra security? And can I recover the keys if I lose the paper wallet like the seeds on a soft wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-23 22:13:35
How does that work? Let's say I have a paper wallet and a fork happens. When I sweep the wallet in Electrum, will that wallet contain BTC or &lt;new forked coin&gt;? How can I send both back to an exchange for example?
