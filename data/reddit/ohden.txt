I would go for it. All you need to accept it is a wallet. My favorite is bittrex and that's online but there are also hardware wallets and paper wallets that are worth looking into. You can exchange it for fit currencies using GDAX or coinbase.

This is just an idea and I have no experience with this: maybe get a bit pay credit card and use it like a normal credit or debit card. You have Bitcoin on them as well. I believe they are used like this if not I apologise but that's my best input.

I had the same issue. In 14 and wanted the same thing. On coinbase there's a form your guardians can sign over an email and you will get full access to coinbase. It takes a while but it will work

Coinomi is great. There's more than just Bitcoin too and you can instantly exchange into a different currency

It's pretty good. I'd check out living on Bitcoin for a week too. You can find it on YouTube pretty easily.

Hardware and paper wallets are best but I like Exodus as well.

No idea if it's a scam but if so and you sent Bitcoin not usd or a national currency then you can't recover it
