Excellent points: merchant adoption is a very important step, and will have an effect once the consumers start using it more.  
There still is a negative buzz around bitcoin in most peoples ears, but it seems like this is starting to change ( stories about people who previously where against bitcoin and are now starting to look into it and start buying/using some).  
It will probably take a while before being adopted by the big masses, so I'm not expecting any huge rises, but rather a steady growth as consumer adoption grows.  
In the end, nobody knows, so we'll see where it will lead us.

Indeed I don't know what will happen, but block reward will halve in 2 about years, mining difficulty keeps rising, and a lot has been going on in the past few months.  
2013 was the year Bitcoin got some worldwide exposure, I see 1014 as the year that will lay the foundations for a more stable bitcoin economy.  
About a year ago I thought the next bubble would be about +/-750/800, retraction to +/- 300/350.  Seems I was a wee bit off.  
5700 in a year is indeed quite optimistic, as my real estimate is about +/- 4000 for the next peak.  
Might happen, might not, but one can dream ;-)
@_date: 2014-06-20 06:54:17
Spot on! That's exactly my point :-)  
If usb miners came with a simple setup wizard that would install the Bitcoin core client and set up solo mining, that would be awesome.
Don't know if it's possible, but if it were possible to mine with a light client like Electrum, than the user could have the option :   
either install the core client (and hereby support the node distribution.. also something that might be solved by this), or install a lightweight wallet and just start mining.  
The whole problem with mining now is that it's getting more and more commercial: for individuals is almost pointless right now : no matter what hardware you buy, the return on investment is close to infinity (if those online bicoin mining calculators are correct). Only big players getting discounts for hardware and power can play this game.  
But if people would treat this as a lottery, and setup would be simplified with a simple install wizard, I'm hoping more people would join the mining game ;-)

"News of the Treasury's Bitcoin review came a day after The Telegraph revealed that the ascent of Bitcoin has been halted, with transaction levels falling, and total volumes, in dollar terms, are now back at levels seen in 2012."  
geez.. ok, the ascent has been halted for the last half year or so .. but still up quite a bit compared to a year ago.   
And volume in dollar terms is the same as in 2012 ?  
I'm calling bullshit on this one : the volume is low indeed BUT the price is a lot higher than in 2012.  
Let's take Gox as leading 2012 trade  
    
that is ( rough estimate) 8 usd as price, about 75000 as volume = 600.000 USD volume  
Now take Stamp as leading 2014:  
  
Rough estimate : 12000*600 = 7.200.000 USD volume
  
not quite " at levels seen in 2012" ....

$5700 , in a year, give or take a few months.  
Block reward will halve in about 2 years, by that time, or a wee bit after that,  we're probably in the +/- $10000 region. It will probably be a steap volatile climb until then, I expect a more steady and slower climb after that to 50K / 100K in about 10 to 12 years.

It's not that silly: the price of bread has also gone up forever. Given that inflation will  probably continue to affect fiat, deflation will probably continue to affect bitcoin. Since we're still in the early adopters phase here, the rise will probably continue to be quite steep for a while. Once market saturation is reached, the price will more likey increase at the same rate that the value of fiat will decrease due to inflation.

It had been ages since I had to use paypal, but recently have used it (yesterday and day before that), and both times I ran into trouble. The payment page was all screwed up, i had to go back and forth a few times before it loaded something where I could log in and actualy make the payment. First I thought it was the website that used an old api/ref or something, but ebay had the same problem.  Don't think my pc was compromised, no abnormal account activity on Paypal.
But it seems to work fine today ( just checked).  
I've been using Paypal for years as a customer. And as a customer, it's just very convenient.  
But using Paypal for receiving payments ? Did that a few times to sell stuff on Ebay ... bloody hell... that's just plain extortion (both from Ebay and Paypal).

I didn't miss the point at all: I know the average return is the same, but the key word here is average: I'm not counting on average, i'm taking a chance.   At the current difficulty rate, and say I get me a 2GH usb miner, the odds of finding a block is 1 in +/- 1000 years.   The odds of winning Euromillions is 1 in 1 in 116,531,800. As this is a weekly lottery, if you play every week, the odds of winning Euromillions is 1 in 2240996 years.

Not related to Anycoin Direct either, and have been recommending them to friends. No complaints so far. I also used them before they went more European (before it was just the Netherlands and Belgium I think), and as far as I know, this is indeed the fastest and easiest way to buy/sell btc. Hence why I didn't get all the fuss about Circle, as this service has been in existence before Circle and buying btc is just as easy as it is on Circle ( or as far as I get Circle, haven't used it yet, but their setup seems quite similar). But perhaps they didn't market it as much as Circle did, and are working on that aspect now ?

As far as I understood it, gold is actually a byproduct of the process to produce energy, so basicly "waste". 
You may be right that the amount produced might be negligible, but if LENR proves to be viable source for energy, this byproduct might be produced in abundance, and the impact of produced gold might no longer be negligible. A lot of ifs and maybes, we'll just have to wait and see how it turns out ...

hmm.. I thought we already had loans in a voliatile inflationary currency ;-) 
Just look at the following chart : 
Since the 1800's, the gdp has started to skyrocket. Bit weird imho.. just happens to be when they started experimenting with non-gold currency. 
Ok, not as volatile as btc, but we're living in a digital age now, stuff moves faster ;-)
I'm thinking bitcoin will probably stabalize at some point in time, and the price for an item would remain stable over time in btc ( givven that supply and demand for the item is constant). But the price in fiat will increase ( as fiat will always be inflationary). 
Anyway, loans have been around for quite a while, long before fiat money, don't see why they won't be able to come up with a loan formula that works for bitcoin.

“The average user is not sophisticated enough to launder Bitcoin,” says Guo.

The average user gives up its privacy, and the so-called pupurpose of this system ( to clear out the illegal stuff) is null and void.

I'm just thinking that since bitcoin is deflationary in nature, it will only increase in value, whereas fait money is inflationary and only decreases in value. With fiat money, they can always print more, with bitcoins they can't. As long as fiat money exists, btc can only increase in value compared to the fiat. I know coins circulate, but in order to payout interest in bitcoins, they would have to get them from somewhere. If all bitcoins would be stored in banks, where would the bitcoins come from to pay the interest? OK, i know not all of them would be in banks, but still. Btc is a bit like gold ( well actually even better, because we know what the final ammount will be, unlike with gold ( ok, there is probably some formule to calculate the possble amount of gold that exists on this planet, but still ..)). I'm just thinking that paying out interest in btc might turn out to be a bit of a problem. It's just a hunch ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:58:48
There is a Senate hearing in a few hours I think. 
After reading this article, I must say I feel more confident that they will try to embrace Bitcoin instead of trying to impose limitations. 
Bitcoin is on the rise, and other countries are jumping in.. if the US does not embrace the technology, it will miss out on opportunities. 
So if any measures are taken to spur the bitcoin economy, it will be beneficail to bitcoin. If they try to constrain it, it probably won't have much effect on bitcoin as the US is not leading the bitcoin economy.
Or did I get that wrong ?

I think the main challenge (for banks) would be to deal with the deflationary nature of bitcoin: you can't give people the incentive to store money in banks with a normal intersest rate (as with regular bank accounts), as the supply is limited.

I hope they have the insight to make a decent evaluation. The problem is that Switzerland has a serious banking economy, and that Bitcoin is cutting out the middle man in the transactions.. the banks. They will probably feel threatened by the whole bitcoin thing, but it will be the same "new technology paradigm" all over again. It's like internet music: the whole music business felt the threat of being wiped out by easier acces to music, but it took someone like Steve Jobs to come up with a viable business strategy. Problem with btc is that you still need to store it somewhere safe, and with a trustworthy instance. Banks coul be that instance, if they wanted to, and change a small fee for transactions made out of the accouns they manage. But the  again, with all the bank crisis stuff going on, I'm not too sure that people will trust even the banks ... just my 2 cents ;-)
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:39:11
regarding 1.
Yup, it still a a LOT of potential.
To put things in perspective, btc has a market cap of a bit over 2 billion.
Apple has a cash reserve of about 170 billion. Even if the total market cap bitcoin went x80, all bitcoins still would not be to buy a company like Apple. If btc will turn out to be a world currency ( and it's making leaps in doings so), it makes sence that it will far exceed the worth of a company like Apple. We're still in the early days ;-)
