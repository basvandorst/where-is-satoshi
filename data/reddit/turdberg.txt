Customer: One medium cappuccino, please.
Barista: That will be 5000 satoshi.
Customer: Ok. Let me just send that to you with the QR app.... and sent. There's your 5000 satoshi.
Barista: Thanks.
Customer: ...
Barista: ...
Customer: So ... where's my cappuccino?
Barista: Oh, we have that in the back.
Customer: Can I have it... now? Please?
Barista: Sure. 
Customer: Ok. When?
Barista: ...
Customer: So... How long is this going to take?
Barista: Thank you for your support and patience. We should have more information on that inquiry for you in about a week... give or take. Until then, why don't you trade your coffee purchase back in for your BTC while we get this mess sorted?
Customer: Ok. So that's 5000 satoshi, right?
Barista: Well... it seems that the exchange rate has fluctuated in the meantime. If you want, we can give you 3500 back right now, OR you can just wait for the coffee.
Customer: Ok. Whatever. Just transfer that over to me. I'll try the Starbucks down the road for now.
Barista: There's just a small commission. It's like super small.
Customer: Whatever. I'll pay it. Just give me my BTC back.
Barista: ... Ok. Great. We have your BTC in the back with the rest. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

edit: I assume the downvotes are on account of the nuclear explosion taking place in Japan.

Just saw a sweet lady bring them some drinks. 
edit: The drinks appear to be fairly tasty. Now back to our indepth coverage of MtGox-Gate 2014.
