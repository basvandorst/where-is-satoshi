damn that's so embarrassing... fixing that now.
@_date: 2014-10-09 18:21:31
that's probably true--I just get hatemail every time I try to ascribe too much significance to bitcoin intraday/week moves from people talking about minimally liquid markets, so I figured the BearWhale thing was fair play, but I'd hedge my bets on describing the response.

Yeah, well the first draft had like a couple thousand more words on non-bitcoin applications of the basic tech (like Ethereum--which I know has ether, but don't let them hear you call that a currency)...
And we tried our best, man!
@_date: 2014-10-10 11:44:20
Thanks again!
@_date: 2014-10-09 18:04:31
Well btc jumped to like $328ish right after the order was filled, so we were talking about rise in value since then... But the point is well taken.

Thanks! Yeah, I was the writer/reporter of the article, and I also scripted the animation for whatever that's worth...
@_date: 2014-09-19 21:02:19
I dunno... One guy I spoke with said yeah, but the rest (including a bunch who called me back after the article pubbed) said no.

Hey, man. Firstly: Sorry you feel that way, but thanks for watching the video anyway.
Secondly: As one of the comments on the article said "They still do it voluntarily and everyone is free to do it should they choose to." (yeah, there's a start-up cost, but the point stands that they're not employees of some nebulous corporation)
Finally: You know that the average reader's/listener's mind would totally be boggled by the word "miner," so I'm just trying my best to get the basic info to the most people possible.

That's probably true for the everyman--but from the CNBC audience perspective we were just trying to highlight that entire business sectors could be turned on their head by the elimination of middlemen all over da place.

Hey guys, author of the piece here. We just got a statement from Tyson, so figured I'd include it here too:
"I'm very proud to be a part of the Bitcoin revolution.  Digital currency is the future and the more I learn about it the more intrigued I become.  Digital currency is going to level the playing ground for those that want alternatives for financial freedom.  No one knows better than I how uncertain the economy can be and at this juncture in my life it is imperative that I am proactive about my financial planning and for me it includes Bitcoin."

Going to this event tonight... Hope the "big surprise" is something interesting.

The BIT is going to be audited by third parties, I believe
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:00:11
So all shares are required to be held for at least 12 months before they can be traded from their original shareholder.
If you were interested in buying a BIT share, then you could either go to the open market and buy it for whatever price they're going for. 
***OR*** you could go to a pre-authorized bank/broker and ask them to create you a new share. That share would cost you 1/10 of the exact price of bitcoin at that time (actually the average 24-hour price of bitcoin as established at 4pm each day, but that's a technicality not really worth worrying about).
What the guys behind the fund are assuming is that most people will want to create new shares because they believe in BTC as a long-term investment. So that will bring the open-market price of those post-12-month shares close to (1/10 of the) equivalent with the actual trading price of BTC.
@_date: 2015-04-01 20:40:48
New (12-month trading restricted shares) will set their price based on BTC—it's just the unrestricted shares that will be trading at some market-decided premium.

I hear you, it's definitely missing USD, but I hesitate to attribute that omission to any sort of intentional slur. Bitcoin is, after all, third on the list behind gold and oil.
Occam's razor makes me think it was probably just the assistant producer forgetting the obvious answer of USD, as opposed to pushing an agenda of BTC hate. Obviously hard to know, though...

I'm a CNBC reporter, so obviously biased in this one, but if you actually listened to the guy during this segment, he said:
"It's a matter of developing the names of the individuals who control these accounts and working your way back through there. Once you have control of the account and cooperation with the exchange of the currency or control of the network, then you can work your way back and find out who these people are who are contributing to the (terrorist) network itself. I would say that it (bitcoin/cryptocurrency) is right now a very small part of how they are developing their assets: Remember that they looted a bank in Mosul with a few hundred million dollars worth of currency in there, they have control of wide swaths of territory, they engage in extortion, they shakedown businesses, they shakedown individuals."
Yeah, that full-screen image seems like it's part of the "then they fight you" narrative, but the discussion was pretty thoughtful and rightfully noted that the blockchain is a cruddy way to launder money.

Pretty dank, but I feel like yall can go danker.

Never been given a script, and the only time I've ever been told what I can and can't write is when (like Friday evening) I was banned from writing non-tragedy-related headlines with sensitive words like "bombed" or "killed" or "explodes." So no "stocks get killed in after-hours trading" or "Company X bombs third-quarter earnings report."
Other than those sorta obvious sensitivity things, I'm totally free to write/report anything I like. 
The real problem with the media, and this is hardly a revolutionary opinion, is that there's such an emphasis on "quick turns" and "hot takes" that reporters will often rely on the easy-to-access corporate/government talking heads for all their analysis.
That's why you so often see a homogeneity of opinion/angle, it's not a lack of press freedom, it's a lack of press time and effort.
Feels weird to put all of this in an thread, so I guess shoot me a message if you have any more questions/comments/complaints.
