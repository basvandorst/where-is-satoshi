I was actually just able to purchase from Gemini, however won’t let me withdraw right away, does it ever let you withdraw? And if so do you know how long it usually takes?

Yea I know the bitcoin price will stay the same, but I find it crazy that with such a fluctuating market, Gemini would make you wait up to 5 day’s to let you withdraw it. Ideally I’d withdraw this bitcoin into my wallet right now and spent it immediately. But instead, if these prices plummet while I’m waiting for withdrawal, I’m pretty much fucked

Interesting... thanks for letting me know

I’ve tried upstate and nyc now because I go back and forth each couple weeks. That’s so weird man. Coinbase won’t even let me sign up for some reason site keeps glitching on me, and Gemini still has taken forever to verify me. Thanks for letting me know tho.

Fuck man, only deepens my hatred for Andrew Cuomo... thanks for the info tho bro.

You sure man? Bc I bought $350 worth of bitcoin and now that it’s in my account I’m already seeing the price fluctuate. Nothing too crazy yet only a couple cents here and there, up and down. But if the bitcoin prices plummet within the next couple days while I’m waiting to withdraw it I’m pretty fucked, no?

Seems like I just shouldn’t have to really go that far and make a whole new bank account. Besides, I’m out of town after today so it was kinda a rushed thing. Was hoping not to have this much trouble

Yea man, honestly this country is getting more and more annoying, feels like communism. But word I’ll keep trying with all three, thanks.

What do you mean by pre loaf some cash? If you mean pre load i still don’t quite know what that means. This 4-5 day wait should be fine this one time, assuming the market doesn’t go crazy within the next few days. I understand that what I have done is something called an ACH transfer. I have been reading that wire transfers are much faster though, if not instant. Do you know if there’s a way in the future to just straight up wire transfer from my bank (chase)? That way I can withdraw immediately and spend as soon as possible before price dips.

What bank do you suggest? I’m usin chase as of now.

So I’m guessing I just have to hope the bitcoin prices don’t plummet within the next 4-5 days?
