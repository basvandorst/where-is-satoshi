Thanks for the question. The way I feel about crypto is that it already spent all its hype capacities and I think the only way it can start regenerating hype needed to again become interesting for the world market is if it can prove that the technology that was promised is actually revolutionary. 
Because you see I feel that market is not defined anymore by how useful a technology is but how much hype it generates - a good example is Tesla. In 2019 we cannot discuss market value of an item anymore just based on the technology it offers but on the hype it generates. 
In case of bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general it was marketed way too early as "get rich quick scheme" and lost a lot of trust. Market is no longer prepared to gamble on it succeeding - it will only regain its value if its proven to be revolutionary. 
Also at the moment as a form of payment with cheap transaction fees does not work because its value is not defined and fluctuates too much.  
So I do not see it being "big" on the market ever again. Blockchain is not unique to crypto and it's only sell value is that it is extremely easy to transfer ... but nobody uses it as a form of payment therefore its transfer value is completely useless at the moment.

The problem with Bitcoin is that as a technology it never really delivered. The price of bitcoin was based on it future value and that destroyed it. i do not see it recovering ever again. Will probably drop to 1000 and stay there for a while before being forgotten.   
IN the time where "hype" defines the value ... the cryptocoin was overhyped and will therefore die no matter how good a technology is behind it.
