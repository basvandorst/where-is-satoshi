No it clearly isn't. There is no law stating it must be free to spend. If the devs decide it costs money, however much, to process a transaction then that is how much it costs. Can't stand it when people assume btc transactions will forever remain free, or practically so, for eternity. There is nothing guaranteeing that

Then make a damned stickied post at the top, but not every post, not even every other post has to be about GHASH. Honestly the people who care about bitcoin figured this out a long time ago judging by how many posts there are saying the exact same damned thing. Besides, just because you leave GHASH does not meat it won't happen with another pool in the future. Then what are you going to do? Post twice as many posts, half about leaving the new pool and the other half about not going back to ghash?

Congrats, you figured out how hard it is to brute force a 256 but key. Just gonna throw this out there, there is a reason top security uses 512, or even 1024 or 2048 bit keys, and that is because 256 bit keys have been hacked before. Just because it would take you however long you decided to go through every single key, does not make it impossible to crack someones private key

Well then, with the current trend we are seeing, eventually even teh smallest denomination of bitcoins, satoshi I think, would be worth far too much to be used for normal transactions anyhow. It might take centuries, but it would happen. And then what do you do, except hoard it (and risk letting even more be lost when you die) or cash in and lose yoru investment?

This is not true. The people who would benefit the most from bitcoin, the people that so many proponents of bitcoin say will benefit the most from it, are the very people that cannot afford to even get into bitcoin. These are the people who could not afford to sink $1000 into bitcoin a few years back, people who cannot afford the hardware to mine it, and obviously cannot afford to buy evne a single bitcoin now. These people are left behind, yet again, not because they chose to be, but because they have no means of getting into it. Do not try to blame them for this misfortune, it is not their fault

You've clearly though this through lol


This is the wrong approach to improving local education tbh. You need to focus on the public schools, on getting laws passed that do not hire people with teaching degrees to teach HS classes, but on hiring people with actual experience in what they will be teaching. A teaching degree is great, knowing how to teach does not mean you know a damn about what you are teaching though. You also need to reform the entire public school system actually. Holding teachers accountable for students who clearly don't care is a problem. Get rid of superintendents, where I grew up our superintendent did absolutely nothing except waste school money by hiring out bad contractors who charged higher prices and never finished. To truly see an increase in local education levels you need to focus on the public schools, increase teacher salary, give recess back, find a way to encourage the rich parents to send their children there, bc they are able to give more donations to the school to improve it further.


I think you should focus more on the people in office. With lawyers being lawmakers and congressmen, there is no way, barring maybe a 100 page constitution or so, to make the document completely impermeable to corruption, and even then an amendment could undo much of that, unless you clearly state what can or cannot be an amendment and then you run into too many problems to deal with. For a long time, US congressmen did a really good job at avoiding corruption and serving the people. All you need to do, is find politicians who are willing to actually work for the people. But in today's consumerism and capitalism markets, that will be next to impossible, as the end goal for almost everyone is to make money, and corporations offer much more money than government does if you are a politician.
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:35:53
No, actually you did an excellent job explaining it haha
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:03:57
I have not made a country, I see no need to tbh. But I could do so in the next 10 min if I so chose. All I have to do is declare my bedroom/house/private property a new country if I live in the US, and they don't ever bother to deal with it. Has happened several times. Some of them actually have anthems and everything iirc. 
Back to your point though, I do believe I could have typed up my first comment better. I was not trying to suggest that you adopt the USD. However, you likewise should not adopt Bitcoins as your nations only currency. If you do, at the very least have lots of physical currency to back it up, whether it be USD, or gold or whatever. If bitcoin crashes suddenly in a decade or two like it should (just based on capitalist societies, the US, and I strongly suspect other countries as well, have shown a general period of a recession every 20 years or so, even if it is relatively minor) and you have absolutely nothing to back it up with you are royally screwed, not only is your currency worthless, but you cannot even print more (not that it helps, but historically, third world countries try to treat depressions with this method so I am just using historical data again). You absolutely need to have something to back up your bitcoins. Even if they magically don't crash, and continuously deflate you could run into problems, although I do not know what they are.
Concerning my second point, you are correct, I did get it backwards (oops), but it is still not going to be easy, mayhaps not even possible for you to do this. Again, historically, after colonialism, to form a new country people did it on the land that they lived on, or owned in a different part of the world. They did not just grab a piece of land that looked like it could be the easiest one to convince governments to give you. You sound like an American, so you truly have absolutely no business trying to take land from Mexico or Canada, or Even Africa if you mentioned that, period. There is no discussion on that point. That land is owned by other people, and if you try to just waltz right up and make it your country people are going to have problems with that. I personally believe your best bet is either secession in a place where either you, or someone else who is going to be important in your new country, lives, or to literally build a country in international waters with ships or something. But taking land from a place you don't live is not ok.
Furthermore, I am not sure if you considered this or not, but if you are successful then what happens. If other people hear about this, and they certainly will, and they decide that they can make a new, better country where they live what's to stop them. You would have demonstrated that it is possible. Why would a government want to send out the message to its citizens that this action is ok, that it is perfectly ok to try to just make a new country. I think on that point alone many governments will oppose this measure. That is unless you have a legitimate list of grievances against current governments. And I am talking about the majority of first world governments, if you simply have a problem with the one you live in, other governments will probably try to relocate you instead of give you a new country, if they even deem it worth their while. 
I am sure you have all of the tiny technical details worked out, like how to get food and water, health care and whatnot, basic life essentials so I won't bother with those.
But one more thing to consider is educating people, not basic education, but political education. Ask any American, or 5, 10, 30 even, about what the ACA really is, what it actually does. Even in that group of 30 you would be hard pressed ot find 1 person that really knows what it does. That right there is the key weakness to our government, besides the fact that lawmakers work for wall street now. The citizens of any country cannot make an informed decision, in any political system, if they do not even know what they are making a decision about (except maybe communism, where they don't actually have a choice). If you could figure out a way to fix that single issue, and give it back to the US when your done with your new country, that would be much appreciated.
Also, you mentioned rich investors, so that makes me wonder whether, at least for them, they are actually helping you bc they have a problem with current governments and think they can help people, or if they simply want another Cayman Islands to dump their bank accounts in. IDC how perfect your government turns out to be, if that is what your country is used for I will hate it forever, and I will do my best to make others hate it as well.

Those just prove a transaction took place. It does not prove it took place without duress, or that any deal was struck to pay cash for the bitcoins. There is no proof of that, so unfortunately this is an example of where bitcoin has failed, per the law OP is out of luck on this one specifically because the bitcoin transaction does not anywhere state that he was supposed to receive any amount of cash for it. As far as law enforcement is aware, OP gave it as a gift.
This will probably be downvoted, but I ask that you don't because people need to see this. Trading bitcoins is fine with an authorized seller, but trading them with other people for money or goods without a contract is flat out dangerous as OP found out, there is no consumer protection here
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:24:06
I have only this advice to give you if you are actually serious about this whole nation thing. 
1) The USD has been tested for centuries, and it is stable, with the occasional crashes like the Great Depression and Great Recession, although both of those could have been avoided by educating the populace and by not having a stock market. Bitcoins have been tested for a few years, and only in an extremely tiny quantity. Yes you guys have all of your theories about how it will work in the future based on the math behind it, but no one has yet taken into account the human element of bitcoin. You can't predict what humans will do, and hence you ultimately cannot predict where bitcoin will go in 20 years or so. If your nation is founded entirely on bitcoins and then they take a massive crash in 20-30 years or so and do not look like they will recover, you are screwed, completely, along with everyone in your country.
2) Unless you decide to build your nation out of large boats in international waters, which comes with its own problems, you are more than likely going ot have to seek support from the UN at some point. If they don't recognize you as a country, but as an upset city-state or something similar then other countries might not recognize you either. This is not what a new country needs.
3) "not modeled after the US Constitution" Like it or not, the US constitution is the best model for democracy in the world. It is not always so in practice however. If you want a democratic republic nation then it will be very hard to not base it at least partly off of the US constitution.If you are planning on having more than a few hundred people then a pure democracy is not viable, and likewise a pure republic has problems as well. Socialism does not work, communism does not work in the long run, all attempts at a Utopian society in which everything is shared equally through any means have failed. A capitalist based government would be even worse than what we have right now in the US, and consumerism ultimately helps no one. So how would you do your government? If you have a magical new system, please let the world know so that we may benefit from it if it truly works
@_date: 2013-11-12 23:09:55
Maybe I am just biased against bitcoins. I have yet to find one person irl who can actually tell me how they work, even theoretically, and yet it is not hard to find someone who can tell me how the Fed theoretically works.
Also they remind me of stocks bc their value keeps fluctuating for no discernible reason to me, though if someone were to explain them I might be able to drop this notion.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:14:59
So? Every OS that sees widespread use except Windows has native support for Python, so its not too much to expect someone to have it. Especially since, it seems, most bitcoins advocates are slightly more techinclined, and thus much more likely to use Linux instead of Windows
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:19:36
The bitcoin wiki makes no mention of this. Besides, who would have the power to decide when to increase the divisibility and by how much? That sounds an awful lot like the power the Fed has right now that so many people who invest in bitcoins are pissed off about, so it kind of would defeat the purpose entirely bc it would necessitate a central bitcoin authority.
Either way, bitcoin loses out if the supply steadily decreases due to coins locked up in dead people wallets
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:04:39
I do not recall saying that we could brute force it, I am fully aware that there were extraneous circumstances involved. Do not be naive enough to believe that Bitcoin suffers from no such weaknesses, it is reviewed by a rather large amount of people, but no code is perfect. 
Besides, I do not really know where the hell OP was going with his math about the improbability of cracking a 256 bit key, I assume a wallet is a 256 bit key or something. But I do know that it is much easier, and much, much more likely that a password will be cracked. Even if the passwords are protected by encryption, they are far easier to crack than the encryption itself is, and there are far more ways to go about that. I would be much more worried about passwords than whatever OP was going on about

And I guarantee that whatever topic it was has loads of information listed on the internet free to search through and for you to read at your leisure. Does that mean you did that or did you do "waste" another person's time asking them the same question they have probably heard hundreds or thousands of times before? Why is it ok for you to do this but not these people??? When you were in school did you ever ask a teacher a question? Chances are they have heard it hundreds of times before, does that give them the right to tell you to fuck off because they are tired of answering it?

I don't follow bitcoin too closely. But from what I have read and heard about it, a lot of people would like to see it replace traditional currency entirely. Even in this thread people are talking about how they would like to see wages paid in bitcoin and whatnot. 
If it replaces currency entirely, what then? If there is no more USD, then bitcoin truly loses all value, bc no matter how much you may protest otherwise, its value is still based off of that of the USD. Its worth a certain amount of USD, take away the USD and it suddenly has no value. 
Argue that it has intrinsic value if you wish, I don't believe that it has any, i believe it is all tied back to the USD.

I am actually against bitcoin adoption hahaha I would not mind overly much if bitcoins were to disappear tomorrow. I think that something people miss about it is the fact that it is slowly adding currency into the economy. I think somewhere I read that the total value of all BTC once they have all been mined will be in excess of $4 trillion dollars. You cannot just introduce that much money into an economy and expect it to not raise prices worldwide, albeit if it is only a little. This would serve only to hurt the least fortunate, and that is not something that I think BTC was designed to do

I'm not doing any shopping with bitcoins actually XD I don't like them, I think they will fail spectacularly in 1 of 2 ways. Either they will crash spectacularly, or they will become investment tools, to be traded like stocks, with their value based solely on how much people want to say they own one or more, in which case they are pretty useless as a currency. 
That being said, even if I did like bitcoins, I only have $0.22 worth anyway haha not really enough to buy anything with I'm afraid
@_date: 2013-11-13 05:51:38
Again though there are no **inherent** advantages to bitcoins. Yes credit transactions have a higher fee right now, but what is to say that the fee for microtransactions in bitcoins wll never rise to be on a similar or even higher level? Nothing. Similarly, the credit companies could change it to lower the transaction fee to what it is currently for bitcoins. Your example is not an inherent advantage for bitcoins.
Like I said, if someone were to rework how credit transactions are processed they could be much more beneficial than bitcoins, and an **inherent** advantage that they have is that they are already tied to a real currency that has been adopted worldwide by almost everyone. This is a huge advantage for non-bitcoin transactions.

Ummm no, they wouldn't. Very few people are going to choose a business to use based solely on whether they accept bitcoins or not, and those that do are probably pretty damned stupid if that is a decision making factor for them.
I am suggesting that just because it seems likely at this moment does not mean it will happen. If one bad thing happens to bitcoin in the near future, anything really, it could drive large companies away from it for years

I see nothing more difficult in pulling out a $20 bill than pulling out a card, swiping it, then signing a receipt (assuming the store is making you do that like they all *should do* even though most don't anymore). I never know how much money is in my account off the top of my head, using a debit card is sometimes stressful because I don't know if I even have enough money in my account to be able to pay for what I am buying, I don't have to deal with that when I pay with cash.
He took a not so random sample of the bitcoin community by choosing and, as so often happens, the most vocal people were the ones that spoke up and made themselves heard so he made the mistake of assuming that they made a good representation of what the entire community felt like. 
If so many of you truly did not want people to think that bitcoin was an investment then you should speak up and stop those people that do from spreading that idea around. Not only because it is false, but because it really truly does harm the adoption of bitcoins a great deal. You are only doing yourselves a disfavor by allowing these people to spread the notion that a bitcoin is an investment, not a form of currency.  
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:34:11
I give up.
Zero percent fees are not something inherent that only bitcoin can have. Right now it is the only currency that has this, but there is absolutely nothing stopping traditional currency from moving to zero percent fees or stopping bitcoin from drastically raising its fees. What is os hard to understand about that.


Again this is no different from the dollar. Assuming bitcoins are roughly equivalent to 100 dollar bills ($100 per bitcoin roughly opposed to $10 or $1000, I know they are worth more than $100 just not how much more), and giving that the 1/1000 of a dollar is considered real currency in the US, we can assume the $100 bill is the base unit of currency and it has 5 decimal places for divisibility so not much different or special there for bitcoins.
You guys hope it is deflationary but there is no crystal ball that will say for sure it will remain deflationary, there is a limit to how much a currency can deflate before it becomes unstable.


Yippee, were throwing more money into a ruined economy. For every $1 invested in bitcoins, according to you, $10 worth of currency are received in the long run. This is not a model that can sustain itself for long before inflation hits.


The Euro has proven that this can be done with traditional currency. Again this is **not** an **inherent** advantage of bitcoins. I don't understand why you think it is inherent to bitcoins and that traditional currencies cannot achieve this. We have demonstrated that they can.


Really? Prove it. Right now this is just an unfounded claim on your part trying to promote bitcoins.

Reading through the other comments in this thread this subreddit is definitely not ready to hear what OP is trying to say. Many of them just see another attack against bitcoin, which I don't believe this is, and decide right off the bat to hate everything OP says which is just sad. It truly was a douchey gift to give out to people if they don't understand btc. 
Also some of the people in this subreddit need to allow an argument against bitcoin to reach the frontpage of this sub and stay there, a serious argument, not a half ass one that they came up with themselves. They tell you to get educated on bitcoin, but refuse to educate themselves to any argument against. When I have asked, here and elsewhere, about bitcoin and its pros over fiat the most recurring answers I have heard are it is decentralized, and there are  inherently little to no transaction fees. Yet since I have heard these answers, the transactions fees have gone up I believe, and there is nothing stopping them from rising again in the future. Likewise as it grows in popularity there will be more, and stronger, pushes to centralize it at least to some extent. 
I am not trying to promote fiat here, but I have yet to hear a serious argument for inherent advantages bitcoin has over fiat other than "I prefer it bc blah blah blah". One of the big things it had going for it was near instant money transfer, and then Mt Gox or whatever started taking weeks and sometimes months to process a money transfer ( I acknowledge that Mt Gox is not the only way to transfer money via btc, it is just an example)

You keep insisting that people do *ALL* of their holiday shopping with bitcoins, yet you never ever stop to think that maybe there is a lot of things someone might want to buy that they cannot with bitcoins.

Stuff like that happens all the time and yet businesses are somehow doing fine. Gas stations are a good example, I personally know people that choose which gas station to use based solely on its name. And gas stations that are right next to each other (for some reason fairly common where I live) both get exceptional business.

This is a bad idea right now, especially with the price so volatile. First off, if the salary happens to be an agreed upon number of bitcoins, then the city could end up vastly underpaying him if the price drops (and face a lawsuit) or vastly overpaying him and losing money if the price jumps. If the salary is based on USD or whatever the national currency is, then it is just a hassle, and annoying, for the city to have ton convert to bitcoin just to pay this one official. 
And what about him living. In such a small town, there might not be enough people accepting bitcoins for him to buy what he needs to live.
Also, if the price of bitcoin jumps right after he is paid, that is not fair to every other employee in the town, whos salary is suddenly worth the same, whereas the value of his paycheck could skyrocket instantly. Not fair, not viable. Bad idea
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:25:57
If you really want bitcoins to take off, you should "invest" in companies or people who are skeptical to start. Give a person, say .1BTC and a company 1-2BTC. This helps adoption and gets you more money.

I think you slightly misunderstand bitcoins yourself. According to their official FAQ, *It's a common misconception that Bitcoins gain their value from the cost of electricity required to generate them. Cost doesn't equal value*.
And honestly I don't see any inherent advantage in bitcoin as opposed to just moving all transactions to internet based credit. We would need to redo the way that those transactions are handled but at least they would still be backed up by a real currency.

Alternatively, no transactions would be the death of bitcoin, so.... more transactions, even if they ultimately keep the money in the same hands, is a sign of healthy market, and could lead more people to believe that it is stable and get into bitcoins which in turn makes it a healthier market.

agriculture is a bigger derp moment in history, it is the biggest derp moment by far, yet you don't hate agriculture. Why is that?
How is saying "anyone who would accept a money that can be endlessly printed is a complete retard." any different from saying "anyone who chooses agriculture, a method of relatively endless food compared to hunting and gathering, is a complete retard" solely because there are problems associated with it (problems that far exceed anything that comes with fiat currency I might add). 
If this sounds like a bag of shit I am way too tired to write coherently and yo should completely disregard this comment

Why do you, and so many other people on this subreddit, assume that someone who dislikes bitcoin dislikes it solely because they did not "get on the bus early and already made a lot of money". Some people legitimately do not like the concept because it seems stupid to them. It honestly has nothing to do with the fact that they did not hop on the bandwagon, these people are the ones who would not have hopped on it in the first place

A chain growing at more than 5Tb a year is not ideal....

At least some bitcoin supporters ackownledge this :) I was trying to convince someone else that the previous fee of practically 0 is not an inherent advantage that bitcoin has and that it could rise drastically at any time, and he refused to listen to me. I am so glad that not everyone here is like him

In the Fed's defense a lot of people struggle to learn code and downloading the code to look at it would not overly help them, while relatively anyone can learn economics, which, in theory, is how the Fed works

That does not matter, the fact remains that his post had absolutely nothing to do with bitcoin other than Apple no longer likes it, and that is old news. Even then that was not the main point of his post. He only posted so he could get karma by complaining about something other people have complained about already
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:30:08
I's sure a person such as yourself can suck it up and stop being an asshole for the 10 seconds it takes to comment and answer their question. It goes both ways here. And most of the negative comments don't even bother addressing the question regardless, they are more of what you previously posted, just grown men and women whining like babies about how they must endure the sacrifice of answering such a question *yet again*, those comments offer no answer whatsoever

I was under the impression that bitcoins could only be divided up to 8 decimal places
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:16:15


The value of "1 BTC" represents 100,000,000 of these. In other words, each is divisible by up to 10^8.
As the value of the unit of 1 BTC grows too large to be useful for day to day transactions, people can start dealing in smaller units, such as milli-bitcoins (mBTC) or micro-bitcoins (μBTC).
Again, this implies that there is a maximum of 8 decimal places that you can divide to. If you only had 1 bitcoin left, then even a satoshi would be worth far, far more than is expected to be paid in a normal transaction

Not anymore we cant. But we could have if agriculture had never been invented. THere are still people out there who survive off of hunting and gathering. 
And you should have a problem with agriculture if you have a problem with fiat. Agriculture is the root problem here, you have a problem with one of the symptoms, not hte root cause. Agriculture is what allowed division of labor to form, it created the upper class which you now resent for controlling the money, that also came about as a byproduct of agriculture.

What? This has absolutely no context anywhere in your post. What exactly are you trying to imply with this statement?
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:14:54
Credit cards were universally adopted, bitcoins are not universally adopted. This is a fundamental difference between the two

This still implies an 8 decimal limit to how much you can divide them up

Where do you live? Its far easier to pay with cash in person. That way you not only do not have to worry about paying a bill later, but it is impossible to spend money you do not have if you are spending cash, that kind of makes your life a lot easier, not more complicated.
As for his fourth point, its not that hard to figure out that it is the case at least on this subreddit. About half or more of the posts I see on the front page are posts from people who try to act like they understand economics and are offering advice to not cash out right now because the value is sure to only rise. That sounds an awful lot like someone who views Bitcoins as an investment instead of an actual currency. So many people treat it like a stock or a bond, buy it, forget about it for a few years, come back and you made tons of money off of it.

The point is I don't want to have to google it, I am not comfortable with something that I cannot ask a random person to explain to me. 
According to the official FAQ from the sidebar, the value of the bitcoin is based partly off of their perceived usefulness. Their value is completely arbitrary, I can't trust any money like that. 
Yes I acknowledge that the Fed has a lot of power over how much the dollar is worth by either restricting or flooding the supply, but if they were to completely flat line the value for some reason there would be repercussions for them and somehow the value would rebound, I cannot see the same happening with bitcoins when they eventually flat line. 
They should be a novelty, not a common form of exchange between parties.

There is always a kind way to answer, being mean is never warranted just because you are tired of something. And like it or not, some people understand information better if it is explained to them by another person in an actual conversation instead of just reading about it online somewhere. In those cases they might not reasonably understand how it works until they can converse with you, even if they have read the faq, don't look down on them because of this

Lol that isn't just something that one dreams up at night for no reason. Pray tell, why, where, who, how large, when.
Or if you don't feel like telling me any of that at least tell me how you plan to just make a new country out of thin air

Then stop acting like them
Edit - While I would love to reply to your reply to this comment, Reddit has insisted that I must wait a certain amount of minutes to do so, and I would rather not so I am hoping you see this reply here instead. But some of you guys really do act like religious fanatics sometimes, and it is getting sooooo annoying. All of the people who are claiming that I do not like bitcoin bc I did not invest early enough (have a hint, if I don't like it, why would I have invested back when it was supercheap?), all of the people who claim that it is the absolute perfect solution to every problem dealing with the economy (another hint it is not), everyone who insists that it will not only become mainstream, but that it will become the one and only currency in the world, anyone who gets pissed at me and others who genuinely do not like bitcoin for any number of reasons (not many of them, but some of them do exist), the people who downvote to hell any post that tries to bring a sense of reasonableness to this subreddit (e.g. is not a post glorifying bitcoin but rather has an issue that OP deems critical with bitcoin, or a post that critiques everyone for posting stupid shit like "OMG bitcoin is worth so much right now. Told y'all I was right about it!"), also annoying are the people who are in denial and assume that it will never crash again (not effing true, based on history it should experience a crash of rather amazing size in about 10-15 years if it lasts that long). I could keep going, but these are the types of people who act like religious fanatics about bitcoins. I am not trying to imply that you are one of them, but they do exist

That is such a stupid reason to go shopping at a store. Just because someone accepts bitcoin does not mean that they necessarily have better quality than a competitor for a similar price, or even similar quality for a similar price (not saying Best Buy has inferior quality or anything, just trying to make an extremely obvious point)


If they receive USD immediately, then what incentive do they have to invest in whatever infrastructure is needed to accept bitcoins in the first place. If they are getting USD out of it, it would be the same to them to only accept USD in the first place. This was an extremely poorly thought out idea by the guy who posted it

You clearly are in full support of bitcoins T_T
Yet you havent yet given me one inherent advantage that it has over traditional currency

So its a measure of activity basically, like the health of the bitcoin market?
