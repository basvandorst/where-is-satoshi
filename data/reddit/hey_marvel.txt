I still can't wrap my head around as to why they would ever visit a planet like that if the goal was to save the people on earth? It's just crazy stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:35:13
How can you see more of the order-book on GDAX? I only see a couple of dollars up and down.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:29:44
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:48:09
What's your guess on monday morning price?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:48:39
And then its 100k and you will be like, holy shit
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:00:38
I was a long time lurker, then I wanted to join the hype for the Infinity War trailer... And here we are :D
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:37:39
Nevermind I got it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:21:25
Futures introduced now?
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:04:58
HODL, end of discussion. :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:16:15
So that's it huh? We're some kind of dip-squad.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:20:35
Imagine a sell-wall with 200k bitcoins. O_o
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:26:52
1000 BTC sell-wall coming up.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:58:31
Considering it only takes 1 click to check the price, I tend to do click a bit too much.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:20:15
Fasten your setbelts everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:38:31
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:51:50
Ok let's try to look past 20k. When that wall is breached, it seems like there is not much resistance beyond 20k. Am I right?
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:18:44
So that's it huh? We're some kind of 19k squad.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:24:44
Bull run over?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:57:52
Sold off a bit, I figured I want to be able to sleep. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:25:02
Up for me
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:54:51
At least you minded the gap between the train and the platform?
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:30:48
500 BTC at 19k to go then.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:58:00
That's why were getting futures I guess
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:18:12
Reading this one month later is eerie.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:05:17
16k wall, where is army of the dead and dragon?
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:03:34
This is pretty mind-blowing to be honest.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:18:17
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:24:10
Hold my beer, I'm going to time travel.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:59:38
Don't invest money you can't afford to lose and it should be fine.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:21:00
This is insane guys
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:58:28
It's about to break.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:31:13
What do they mean with "will there be"? it either is or is not.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:22:15
And the wildest day still remains, (CME Sunday).
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:08:59
Will it be able to sustain 12k?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:26:45
And CME has not even launched yet, dear mother of lord.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:00:22
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:37:36
Yeah I get exactly what you mean. So when it hits 25k, 19k is going to feel like a loss, right :)?
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:09:33
Watching GDAX is addictive...
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:04:16
I wonder if he will HODL?
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:37:29
This would make sense though.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:13:02
US is going to wake up to a big surprise...
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:07:07
Still like 500 bitcoins to go before any heavy moves.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:07:29
That was glorious to witness!
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:36:20
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:01:37
19560 now... may god be with you.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:22:24
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:26:41
I assume you bought those with money you can't really afford to lose? If the answer is yes, rethink your investment?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:36:08
Yes, but that would suck though.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:03:58
Holy... MOLY
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:59:26
Ok what are we going to discuss?
