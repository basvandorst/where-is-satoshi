I would get out with at least half, or sell most but keep 1 bitcoin just in case it goes to $1mil. 
Sure it can go to $40k-$1mil, but just as easily it can go back to $1000.
$800-$1200 is probably the intrinsic value given it costs electricity to mine, so I don't think it can go lower than that.
I think the futures market will try to speculate it down, and people like Winklevoss will dump a bunch of their btc while they bet short all the while making money for fees on their btc exchange. Not like they needed the money anyway, they had $11mil to invest in btc awhile ago which is now worth $1 billion.

Nice troll, but remember that a large amount of coins are owned by the creator of bitcoin who is anonymous. So you simply move from the banks controlling money to some unknown entity (government, corporation  or individual). Stepping from the frying pan into the fire.
Also, you can’t deny the existence of alt-coins. They do exactly what bitcoin can do, artificial scarcity, fungibility. But most importantly half are not owned by some unknown person/government.
If you want to change the system, make blockchain accounting traceable and put EVERYTHING on the table. FULL disclosure, I want to see how funds are allocated, who owns what, who makes how much per year, and who spends what on what, then people can be held responsible. I want to see even the spending of senators, parliament members and all politicians worldwide, everyone should see. Then maybe the people would have the decency to change by themselves.

Deanonymizing users is the way to make this legal and widely adoptable.
Facebook and LinkedIn grew and developed out of an anonymized internet (MySpace,nexopia and other social networks). The main factor of their growth is the fact that people began to give their real identities and then advertisers saw a way to target ads based on verifiable demographics/psychographics.
We need  the crypto currency system to be linked to people’s real identity in one way or another, if not, existing power structures won’t adopt the technology that easily.

Me too but first I wanna make sure it’s not some super rich company/govt/monarch that owns half the money because we would just be back where we started.
