I really hope you bought Litecoin

Or you could just could of bought Litecoin and laugh at this nonsense. Bitcoin trading is extremely fast paced in terms of price and sometimes the confirmation times could have you hanging on the edge for a long time. Litecoin is proving from every metric, it's market cap, charts and patterns to be much better for me to trade. I know I'm going to get downvotes cause this is a bitcoin sub but seriously the price swings daily on BTC require nerves of steel. If you just hold in a wallet and use pay-pal and don't check it every 15 min then this doesn't apply to you. If you are using bittrex and doing some arbitrage then you might have some idea what I'm talking about.

Cause the devs behind the coin wanted to make a coin that was not suseptible to ASIC hardware. The fact that it's scrypt coin means that it can only be effiecently mined on GPU's makes the means of production available to anyone and not a couple ASIC hardware cartels. Also the transaction times are 4x faster as the confirmation algorithm is much more effiecent and if Litecoin was used by Amazon it would not be an absolute nightmare like bitcoin. Vendors, banks and Amazon itself would struggle with millions of small transactions waiting for confirmation. 
Sorry I owe a more detailed comparison, I'll edit this later as I'm actually out and about rn. Also one of the coinbase people is a dev so you can guarantee there will be widespread access to litecoin.

Question, how do you make money in a bear market? I find the liquidity in the exchange isnt enough to cover fees during bear times

I have been trading on my new account. Up from 5.26$ to 8.16$ just this morning. I'm proving that it doesn't matter what you start with or what the market does. Play with the liquid, shoot for 6% and be hyper fast. 1% pertrade done 3 times is more than my bank gives me annually. 
My other account is on hold, coinbase has locked me out as my new phone does not allow me to verify the login so I'm trading pennies for now!
