It's not an exchange, just a retailer store of Bitcoin. If you have less than 50BTC you can sell to them quickly on normal days. But when the market is fluctuating they cut down their price sharply.

Try Campbx, you will have to put money in Dwolla first. 
(Once in Dwolla, transfer to them is instant and only $.25 is charged. The website is a bit slow though.)

Someone is selling 1000 BTC at $94.48, so it could take a while to get through that.

Their major customers ARE those people who use bots. Think about it, those people must hold large volume. 
They won't limit those just as Wall Street won't limit algorithmic-trading

Nice article. Want to tip the author.

It sells immediately, but the money takes time to deposit to your bank account. 
In other words think of them as a retailer, not an exchange.
