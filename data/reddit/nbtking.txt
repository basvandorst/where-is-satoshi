New claim? I think it is pretty well established history of lying and exaggerating is clear to anyone who has bothered to look. 
Everyone this post was aimed at is assumed to have working knowledge of what is going on. And why a centralized premined coin and the massive theft that is happening should be reported. If not this was a message for those to research it. Its hard to summarize what is going on in a topic title. This was a call to action not a description of what is happening.

The OP is not advertising, they are saying report the owner to the SEC so he will go to jail for fraud.

This isn't just another scam in the cryptoworld. These people have been perputrating a long running mining ponzi and this is their way of escaping the fallout by escalating it. Their market cap is 3rd above Litecoin and approaching passing Ripple.

Is kraken really going to support this or is it another lie?

Also not decentralized

People deposit to your site and trust you will send the resulting money. There is still a lot of risk involved. If someone hacks puts their deposit address on your site, they keep the money. Or if you don't send it out, there you could deny you received it.

GNUnet is better, why is a currency involved? 
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:31:37
Again not decentralized, poor implementation.

Thought you don't endorse coins, least that was the claim when you were taking money from the GAW miners XPY scam.

Or they are waiting to react.

Localbitcoins requires them to hold your funds in escrow, that is not decentralized. 
This level of ignorance is why it is so easy for people to steal bitcoins.

The exchanges that didn't close make a lot of money from the volatility actually.

Its a tax write off and simultaneous advertisement for a giant corporation.

This is why people think Americans don't bother to learn anything about the world and live in a bubble.

Calling downward price a sign of a scam is square minded.
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:54:38
Whats the point of holding if its not being used for its purpose? Novelty?

That is how LE works, they profit from crime so they can afford to go after new crime. Its the circle of crime.

You are an asshole, advertising your shitty service here? You have terrible support, can't support large volume and backed XPY until you back pedaled. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 01:31:34
Good chance actually.
@_date: 2015-02-21 14:34:06
Since when do people with a lot of venture capital not steal money? Were you not alive through the 2000's?
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:23:05
You have a blog? So does everyone else. 
You are joking but our technology is allowing us to run our own services easier and thats a good thing.
@_date: 2015-02-16 01:32:22
You defended XPY then you removed it when it was well past the point it was obviously a scam.
@_date: 2015-02-16 01:30:54
How does multisig change anything? If they can lose one key they can lose both just as easy. This is just buzzwords unless someone plans on running an exchange where everything is done manually.

It would actually be really nice if there was an easy way to run our own mail server again. ISPs actively prevent this from happening.
