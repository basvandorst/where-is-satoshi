Lol dude I make a great living here in NYC sitting on my ass and working from 10:30-6. What I mean to say I have trouble finding remote jobs that pay me the same amount with the same comfort of basically getting paid to go on Reddit.
Guess what professional people exist in every country. Venezuela has roaming blackouts that affect the entire country. The capital Caracas is like the murder capital of the fucking world. There is a lack of access to basic medication for treatment of illnesses.
Why the fuck would I hire a developer in Venezuela just to save some money? Why are you insulting me? I did not make Venezuela the shit hole country it is where millions of people are running away as refugees. You fucking did that.

I am a iOS developer that is based in the US that has 4 years of experience and even I have trouble finding remote jobs. 
You have to realize that programming is not just about shoving a human into a cube with some designs and telling him make a website or something to that effect.
Most programming jobs are projects where you are interacting with other peoples code. If we hire somebody from Venezuela for cheap and they write tons of shit code then everybody else in the room will have to pay for it. 
If we hire somebody in Venezuela and they are kidnapped or go missing then everybody else will have to figure out what the hell they were doing when they go to bug fix their stuff. 
All of this stuff matters. Most programming companies outsource support and other easier programming jobs overseas. You hire a team in India to fix a couple of bugs here and there. You do not give somebody from a country in the mist of a civil war and societal collapse the keys to your Ferrari.
