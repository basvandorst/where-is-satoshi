Since you obtained it for free, your cost basis is $0, so you'll pay capital gains taxes on the current value.

You DO win way more when you get it right, minus any funding fees to pay for borrowing someone's coins while doing it. You can't lose more than 100% of what you put in, though.

Not on BitMEX.

I don't get it. Before the sudden drop, there was a pretty sizable wall at $300. How did that get bypassed? Did someone dump enough coins to break through the $300 wall and create a new one (either by themselves or by triggering automatic bot responses)?

It's incredibly easy to change your phone number. Fingerprints, though... not so much.

This sounds like either carbon monoxide poisoning or mental illness. The former is easier and cheaper to check for.

Don't compare the block size to one of the fundamental pillars of Bitcoin (the supply and the block time). It has been changed in the past and it will be changed again.
It'd be tempting to include the PoW algorithm alongside the two mentioned, but it'll probably have to be changed at some point to a quantum-resistant variant, should such a thing become necessary.

For a community created around a piece of technology which requires no trust or figures of authority, you sure seem to like the exact opposites.
Any talk of trust, credibility or account age should have no place in the crypto community. Con-men thrive on building trust and rapport, only to strike when it's most advantageous to them. 
Whenever someone makes a certain claim, they should follow it up with proof. If they don't, or if the proof is insufficient, feel free to disregard their statement.
In this case it looks like the OP backed up their claim and is asking for advice on how to proceed. That's it.

You're not mining Bitcoin.

If it's not physically connected to the target device (PC/phone), then the hardware wallet would need a battery.
If it has a camera, then it'll need a faster processor and more memory to do real-time video processing.

Mining on any sort of consumer hardware stopped being profitable back in mid-to-late-2013.
Mining on a laptop has been unfeasible since long before that.

He uses Mint, too.

That may have been true years ago, but looking at just the top 25 crypto assets shows how wrong you are.
Out of those 25, only a few are based on Bitcoin: Litecoin, Dogecoin, and maybe Zcash and CryptoNote-based currencies, at least in terms of ideas. The rest are unique and incompatible technologies (Ethereum, Ripple, Dash, Monero, NEM...), or assets based on Ethereum.

There's no hardware wallet that supports every single crypto-of-the-day out there. Both Ledger and Trezor, however, support most of the largest cryptocurrencies, so at least you can minimize your risk.

That's what I don't get about people in this sub looking at PoW change as "a weapon to fight the miners".
The reality is: if your coin is backed by a PoW algorithm, mining power will always centralize in China. They have dirt-cheap (or free) electricity, as well as most of the chip foundries. They'll always have priority access to whatever hardware is needed for mining, and at the lowest cost.
Say you switch to a GPU-friendly algo. Do you really think the likes of Jihan can't procure a million (or 10 million) GPUs, especially if they're backed by the government, as so many here think he is?

That doesn't account for the panic selling which usually accompanies big drops.

I independently came up with the same solution and can confirm that it works.

As tuzki said, currently Avalon are the only ones that have shipped a working product, but good luck getting in line.. they've already filled all orders in the second and third batches ($1,499 and ~75 BTC, respectively).

Uh, no?
Get a hardware wallet. Even if your PC is compromised, your private keys will be safe.
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:50:44
I'm seeing 3450+ BTC needed to get to $92. How did you get 2000 BTC to $100?
@_date: 2013-04-05 21:38:06


Yes. Or at least until someone figures out the private key/encryption. But yeah, taking coins out of circulation should increase the price/value of the rest.
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:06:53
You're welcome. I agree, it's a bit confusing. 
If you decide to cash out via wire, would you mind telling me how it went?
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:55:48
Got ~90 BTC back in late 2010. I thought it was a joke and that it wouldn't go anywhere, so I sold them early 2011.
@_date: 2013-04-28 19:53:03
Correct. They'd just launder the coins.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:05:15
I'm at that point where I'd be ecstatic with either extremely high (sell and be rich) or low prices (buy as many coins as possible). Anything in-between, like now, sucks since the price could go either way.
What's the main thing stopping you from buying?
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:49:01
I understand. There's a serious lack of good buying options for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-07 11:46:17


All of the major exchanges do.

They're finally being shipped in large enough numbers to influence the [global hash rate]( and thus the difficulty.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:14:40
Since the cause is obviously psychological, I'd recommend you exchange enough BTC to cover your initial cost, thus allowing you to operate debt-free or with 100% profit margin, so to speak. If you feel that's not enough,  sell some more coins or even better, buy something you've liked for a while from some of the merchants who accept Bitcoin. Then, put the rest into one or more offline/savings wallets and forget about them for a while.

You're trading security for convenience.
That's perfectly fine unless you're storing all of your BTC on that wallet/address.

It should be 2000 Yen, not Yuan. That's about 14 GBP.
Mt.Gox is based in Japan.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:47:59
Yep. 
First thing most of the new speculators are going to do tomorrow is sell whatever bitcoins they're holding. Those who are waiting to buy cheap BTC won't put up strong walls on the way down since, hey, the lower the price, the better for them. 
$20 BTC? It's more likely than you think.
