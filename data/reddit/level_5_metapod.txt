If the tech were ready &amp; it were good enough then the real life use cases would come. Until then, bitcoin is the best compromise. 
I agree that Litecoin is very useful, but bitcoin cash is just a temporary bandaid &amp; would have to fork every time the capacity is reached.
The thing with litecoin, is there’s much less at stake to fuck up &amp; I’m glad that bitcoin core is watching new implementations &amp; being conservative about them as there’s just so much at stake.
Disruptive innovations are never perfect initially but how many critical bugs has bitcoin has versus all the altcoins that promise everything you want to hear?
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:51:40
This is a 50% drop vs a 94% drop to $2. Stop thinking in absolute terms, you can buy fractions of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:11:17
Whenever I bought food in a restaurant with bitcoin the waitress just showed her QR code &amp; I scanned it. The UI is fine for that use case.
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:56:06
Zoom your chart out &amp; then count the days in bitcoins history where your investment declined vs the ones where it didn’t. It’s still a good investment on pretty much any day in its history.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:59:59
No one is forcing you to buy an entire bitcoin. If you had invested $10 in bitcoin in this bubble you would now have around $5. If you invested the same amount in the 2011 bubble you would have 70 cents after the crash.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:06:26
Me too! I turned 18 that day.

@_date: 2018-01-31 12:05:47
Dude, I saw btc drop from 30 to 2 dollars. This drop is nothing compared to that, just wait it out. The money doesn’t come for free, it’s gonna cost you some nerves.
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:02:14
Come on, I’m as much a lightning fan as you but that’s not how it should work, &amp; you know that. It’ll be ready soon enough though.
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:58:24
So I continue your strategy at 200 and it doesn’t sink further. It’s now rising to 400 &amp; I panic buy. I now have half my coins.
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:25:57
I’m a fan of ethereum as much as anyone, but 70% of transactions are thought to be in the worst case a single mixer &amp; in the best case one exchange. The network because incredibly slow because of cryptokitties &amp; anyone who thinks POS won’t increase centralization (look at the top 100 eth addresses) isn’t thinking straight
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:11:26
I was in the same position in 2013 when i bought in at 200 on the way up. Not long thereafter it crashed down to 40 again. 
Just ride it out, Even a 50% correction puts us back only one month.

No thanks, Too busy Drinking my dessert-like coffee!
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:20:38
i don't really understand the fees part- it says 2.25 euros ( but is that for every transaction that is converted to euros on the spot?
@_date: 2014-01-12 21:44:32
Oh I wasn't talking about the US. It was more of a general statement.

I think ill do the latter. (With encryption) - ill google up on bip38. Thanks for Taking the time to explain this!
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:03:28
Okay thanks! So its basically a Print-out of the private key? Can my Friend for example import it into his wallet with no further information required?

Thanks! So is the paper wallet basically a qr code? Can you go more into Detail how i can spend lt again or Import it to an exchange? If someone sees it and scans it can they "steal" the bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-12 21:00:33
I'm on your side buddy, but its not for "doing nothing" - they provide police protection, a legal framework, infrastructure, health care, schools etc
@_date: 2014-03-19 11:32:40
So if im in Europe i have nothing to worry about?

Yeah but with segwit it was all over this sub..I'm still on the edge about bu/segwit but it's really annoying that you can't build an educated viewpoint on this sub

As dumb as Satoshi- he intended for hard forks to happen 
@_date: 2017-02-19 02:45:12
I have to disagree, the third top post right now in the other sub is "why I'm against BU" &amp; there's a civil debate going on. Granted, it's not always like that but that's how it should be and that type of discussion should be promoted in both subs.
How will we ever reach consensus with ad hominems from both sides &amp; both living in Filter bubbles? 
@_date: 2017-02-22 13:43:42
I'm from btc and I appreciate both subs. Yes, both subs are biased but I would really like more constructive debate. Its clear both sides are passionate about seeing bitcoin succeed and we just need to find a way to live with each other. I'd love to see the ad hominems disappear and openly discuss the pros and cons of BU vs Segwit. We're all intelligent tech-savvy people and shouldnt be following concepts religiously.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:44:44
Then please enlighten me about the planned roadmap?
@_date: 2017-03-16 07:13:04

Sorry, personal attacks then! 
@_date: 2017-03-17 09:32:38
Confusion &amp; worry from non nerds has been there since day one! The tech can and already has survived through massive amounts of fud. Chaos is what we have now, I doubt that would be compounded if we have two chains with aligning goals. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 08:56:41
if you transfer a very small amount to the newly created change wallet with a super high fee, that transaction will confirm quickly, confirming all dependant transactions too (the one in limbo)
@_date: 2017-03-05 12:57:56
Sorry what does that mean?
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:53:53
User or miner?
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:13:57
So we have two extremes - an irresponsible unlimited option &amp; an ineffectual 1,7mb option - hey why don't we try to compromise instead of having one of these shitty options?
@_date: 2017-03-17 09:06:52
Why is that chaos? That's the best scenario. Evidently, there's two types of people who want two different types of bitcoin. This would allow the existence of both &amp; separate the fighting entities.

ok, currently restoring to old phone! crossing fingers!
@_date: 2016-06-02 14:49:03
Well yeah that's the best case scenario but the point of this thread is to find out if there are other possible scenarios that could eventually evolve

It did work - definitely writing every phrase down from now on

@_date: 2017-08-08 13:01:27
@_date: 2016-11-03 06:15:45
My point is that it's not worth it for them, so they won't use it.
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:27:56
I wouldn’t call it a scam, &amp; they do have bold visions. But it’s just not feasible..
@_date: 2019-10-23 23:35:03
I started buying in March 2013 before it crashed to a fifth of what I bought for. It’s all relative &amp; you can’t even see that on a log chart anymore :)
@_date: 2019-08-04 13:32:33
So the market has already decided?
@_date: 2016-12-22 01:18:24
whats the easiest and most fool proof way to store my bitcoin? im okay with spending up to 100 euros and ive heard of things like trezor.
@_date: 2016-11-02 23:08:45
Are you kidding? Are you willing to spend half an hour of your wages for a simple transaction?!
@_date: 2018-06-04 23:45:53
While a coordinator - controlled by the iota foundation, &amp; proven to have changed transactions in the past, orders every transaction? 
Every single argument for iota is circular “we will scale once we remove the coordinator, which will happen once we’ve scaled enough”
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:26:17
Thanks, short comment on why they are important?
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:47:50
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:11:17
That was me ��
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:52:31
And here I was assuming most miners were adults
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:13:13
Scaling isn't feasible with bigger blocks. Think of it this way:
 Currently fees are high at the current load of transactions and lets say most people make around 5 transactions per month currently. When adoption rises by an order of magnitude (300k -&gt; 3M monthly users, 3M-30M, 30-300M and so on) we need to increase the block size by an order of magnitude (10 MB blocks, 100 MB, 1GB).
 And then lets assume bitcoin is increasingly used on a daily basis, meaning 50 transactions per month instead of 5. Soon we need 10 or 100GB blocks in order to keep up with adoption. 
Raising the block size, although the obvious solution, is no more than a band aid. Sure, core could raise the block size to an arbitrary size (2mb, 4mb) but it would be a drop in the water, while at the same time sacrificing the decentralisation of the chain.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:14:29
Agreed - But I think the capacity should change flexibly so that the equilibrium remains in the realm of 10-100 cents. Whether this means changing the block size or any other variable remains to be seen.
@_date: 2017-11-06 10:11:29
Thanks for your response. 
1) would be of little importance to an egoistic stakeholder like myself 
2) I trust BTCs probabilistic consensus enough to refrain from this
3) This is a really good point, I didn't think of that - you changed my view.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:15:39
140 now.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:42:29
So why are we banking on lightning saving us, if it’s improbable that miners would accept such a change? What alternatives are there to just raising the block size?
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:20:21
The mods in that thread even said they can’t lock the thread due to lack of hard evidence. The only thing that’s lacking are critical thinking skills on their part.
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:54:40
There are some real people there that offer some good discussion on big blocks, but all that is drowned out by all of the spam. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:01:10
Who operates a full node nowadays? If you're in a pool you don't need to. Unless its for hobby purposes of course.

I can assure you that a german referendum would not support the actions of "Germany" right now 
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:13:56
But as long as they control a large share of the miners - they're at least partially paying themselves.
@_date: 2017-04-23 01:18:06
Looks like you belong in the BU Camp then 
@_date: 2017-04-01 10:10:52
The argumentation against implementing the compromise is that it will be harder to increase block size down the line and allows an attack vector through bloated 4mb blocks (that only have a 2x capacity increase)
@_date: 2017-04-01 17:06:19
lets not kid ourselves that both subs are cesspits of propaganda and name calling one another won't bring us any further in this debate (which should be technical and not idealogical!)

@_date: 2017-09-04 10:58:35
Bitcoin fell from $30 to $1. You would have sold then and look at BTC now.

@_date: 2013-11-21 00:47:05
am i the only one who's scared of this? If they make this easy enough for the regular folk and market this well then people won't care about adopting bitcoin anymore..
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:10:17
@_date: 2013-12-25 13:19:22
Um why? I use bitcoin on my iPhone with no Problems? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:38:22
and how exactly are bank transfer costs worth 400 dollars per coin?
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:20:17
When is gyft for europe coming? :)
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:28:14
Bitcoin.de for me
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:48:38
At least the username is fitting.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:18:30
Sincere question, but how do you feel today then?
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:45:07
Wait till it drops even further ;)
@_date: 2017-06-16 05:56:33
Yeah I implemented that policy when I bought a 100 dollar amazon gift card for 4BTC &amp; regretted it...
@_date: 2013-12-22 11:24:53
I dont get it, ive been using the blockchain app on my iphone for most of this year..
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:55:54
calling people shills will get us nowhere
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:24:13
What does that mean? a sell wall?
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:35:13
it has, ive been using the blockchain iphone app for months
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:14:25
on what basis apart from wishful thinking and random extrapolation of market cap?
@_date: 2018-12-15 09:00:20
False. Golds “intrinsic” value is around 50 dollars. The rest is speculative value.
@_date: 2013-12-01 11:31:29
Where can you buy Gift Cards? Is there anything other than gyft for us Europeans?
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:13:01
Thanks! I know i shouldnt Invest without knowing too much about my investment, but I think the best way to learn is to put a little capital behind something!:) 
Is the success of Neo bee only dependent on the success of Bitcoin or are there other factors as well?
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:35:36
Am I missing something? I'm using the blockchain app to send and receive bitcoin on my iphone
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:55:21
Thanks for your comment, i guess i misunderstood you. I don't see what apple stands to gain from banning it though? It doesn't really compete with their credit card ecosystem.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:21:52
why not brute force the private keys?
@_date: 2013-04-26 13:37:45
Using a regular bank also depends on a key: your pin code. How is that so much more secure?
@_date: 2013-12-23 04:09:47
My brain has definitely failed, mr random internet guy
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:12:05
but how would bitcoin grow if adoption doesnt increase?
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:25:32
Thats a good point. And by the time paypal changes those conditions it might be too late for them.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:04:54
What if the passphrases are simple? Cant you try to guess those? 
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:49:51
Thanks, I will go from there :)
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:30:41
So brainwallet can only generate one address for any given passphrase entered?
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:50:54
Maybe in a few years time but you started with "in the coming months". As with many disruptive technologies, bitcoin will probably take 1-3 years at least to reach the widespread adoption everyone is talking about.
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:38:04
its actually british first.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:45:37
Valid points but think of supply and demand. More people want to sell out of fear and more people want to buy in out of greed. If theres as many people selling as buying then it will remain stable
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:37:53
oh no, not the parish
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:24:00
Thanks, great answer.
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:18:53
Id like that, but how do you know the good news isn't already factored into the price?
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:06:05
bitcoin.de is almost perfect. Unfortunatly I think you may need a German bank account.
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:56:31
I can just imagine the same girls joining in around 1.30 being all like "what a weirdo!" during the first minute
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:00:19
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:35:50
ive been using the app for months without a problem. Calm down, its just an OS.
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:43:17
just search for blockchain in the app store and download the app
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:37:56
their profits are private and their losses are public
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:24:27
Really glad to Hear that :)
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:44:31
how can one invest in neobee?
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:51:39
And I'm glad they do. Everything just works and I'm not missing any functions that are important to me. Plus, google doesn't get ALL of my data ;)
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:59:30
Bitpay billion dollar? I'm all for bitcoin but isn't that a bit too optimistic?
@_date: 2013-11-24 11:43:49
oh yes, train is coming very soon..they are building it right now!
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:45:07
and neither do the Vietnamese with 25,000 dong
