Being a small business owner myself that accepts bitcoin, I agree with you and I've seen this happen.
Still, there are always places (such as amazon) that will not take my btc :) 
I can't live without amazon! lol

Ah you're right, but it looks like they don't support Canada. I tried to sign up and they need an SSN which as a Canadian I don't have one.
Your method should work fine for American citizens though, thanks for the link.
Looks like I'll be doing some little workarounds somehow

Are you sure they support canada/us? 
I signed up for a few sites that said thry did, then when I ordered the cards they said visa had changed some stuff and you can't do it anymore? 
I don't Know why these sites don't make it clear before signup. 
Crypto pay took it a step forward saying they do support us and Canada and then after buying a card they gave some excuse that they are making changes and it may take longer.

Everyone here knows the purpose and intention of bitcoins, however some small business rely on the bitcoin network AND fiat currencies simultaneously. 
To assume they should remain completely separate for legitimate businesses, seems unrealistic.
