One of the things I loved most about the freakonomics [podcast] ( about bitcoin, was its emphasis on the underlying protocol as a new and revolutionary technology... Talking about the big bucks being invested, the potential alternate uses other than as currency, etc. The Mises quote drove it home too. Maybe less technical stuff, and more about what the protocol actually is, and why its so awesome as compared to everything that currently exists... Also, the comparison of bitcoin now to the internet in the 90's...  
That's my two satoshi.

The panels lock in, and its way less work replacing a panel (for potholes), they are individual hexagons. And any glass that is destroyed could easily be recycled into new panal glass.. Also, I don't think I said "PUT EM EVERYWHERE". And I'm pretty sure I said the " hwy" idea was just that, an idea... Open to new ideas, like parking lots, or privately owned subdivisions like the Greater Earth ship Subdivision...or ones that do not even pertain to solar. The point was to start a dialogue... this community has such harsh reactions reacting to things that do not even pertain to what people say...
Thanks for all of your harsh criticisms though, and sarcastic comments, thats a great way to stifle innovation within our community. If I were affected by these I would prolly never post in this sub again, so maybe we should try not to be so harsh, eh? Just because you don't like the idea, doesn't mean you have to be a sarcastic douche, who's main argument against is invalid.

So why the hype?

@_date: 2014-08-04 02:19:48
Haha!! Yeah, they totes misspelled it. I let them know, but evidently it's a huge deal to change it? At least that is what they said... be aware this was at Decatur, TX DMV  
Lol decator, tx
@_date: 2014-04-20 16:01:05
Interesting, where does one go to find that out? I want to think I have researched enough, but I guess not...
@_date: 2014-05-27 20:38:42
Not a gimmick, not at all, but you don't have to be apart of it. I can't believe the things I'm hearing coming from this community!! As if Bitcoin is the poster child for sticking to what we know, and not thinking into the future or outside of the box... Oh wait..
@_date: 2014-07-14 00:11:41
blockchain also has a secondary password option you can set for when you send coins... and its keylogger proof because its an onscreen keyboard that you click...
@_date: 2014-05-31 23:18:53
Might be your banks fault... not coinbase. You called your bank yet?

Moar!! Free bitcoins too!!
@_date: 2014-08-04 02:09:37
For the longest time me too. After I found out about it, maybe six years ago, after stumbling upon the Temple of the Way of the Lights' website, I read and read all I could on the subject. I eventually told myself I would just wait until it came to me. An acquaintance of mine from Hawaii called me up from Austin one day... we were in Dallas, and the ceremony was 5 days out.... it was pure synchronicity. It'll come when you're ready!! Aloha
@_date: 2014-08-04 02:02:35
Haaa thankyou! This works in both of our favors... Much love.
@_date: 2014-03-30 13:02:55
Yeah, it uses Bitcoin, not bitcoin...  
Free market, baby! This is how we tell in real time if Bitcoin can stand alone as an actual currency, or just a way better method of transaction...
@_date: 2014-08-04 06:28:56
Thanks brother. And yeah, I have no clue how that came to be. It just happened. Haha.

So what if we were not talking bitcoin specific... or even Bitcoin specific??? What if we were talking cryptocurrency in general? You mentioned 10 failed interenets, but the idea stuck and evolved...

Yeah, when Western Union goes under, we'll all be there to buy up their old locations. Very loudly replacing it all with bitcoin...  
P.S. that bitcoin using rival is ZipZap... And there is even word of Charlie Shrem maybe bringing that to the states
@_date: 2014-05-27 07:25:00
Yeah sure! Bitcoin hwy was just one idea... We could ,say, fund installing the panels on all the roads and drive ways of the [Greater World Earthship Subdivision] ( oorrr, some other privately owned parking lot/road/side walks/whatever...  doesn't even have to be solar, the possibilities are endless..

But there IS room for inovation though. I really like the early Bitcoin to early internet comparisons.... so many parallels.

Also, I wonder how many folks pointed out "blindingly obvious holes" in Bitcoin when it first was launched... Yeah way to go guy.
@_date: 2014-08-15 20:28:53
Can somebody explain why it cost $100,000 for overstock to integrate bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-30 07:47:53
That's fair...
@_date: 2014-05-27 20:18:24
And no I am not an idiot, I am a member of this community, trying to think of ways to garner more interest on a large scale. I didnt say anything about bitcoin failing if we don't do it. Yeesh, sometimes I wish we had the doge community instead of this one, coming down on a guy cuz you don't think his idea is a good one... Ok fine, but why be a dick about? We need more friendlies
@_date: 2014-04-14 02:11:15
Well actually busking is playing music for people on the street. Its huge in Seattle. People love it. If they like it enough, they'll toss coins or a couple dollars in your case/busket...
I've made up to $80 dollars in two hours in some places. Its also a really good way to get your name out there as a musician, especially if you give away a CD or something when people toss money in...  
ITS NOTHING LIKE PANHANDLING. Panhandling is the act of simply just asking for money, or begging. And not doing anything for it. Begging is annoying. Panhandling, begging, spanging, flying signs, all the same thing...  
Busking is good and we should support it when we hear something we like...  
Support your local musicians!!!
