Completely incorrect. The issue rests SOLELY upon the specific exchanges and their customized way of handling Bitcoin transactions and hash IDs.

Certainly, but you could have answered this for yourself if you read my post above. 
this is BTC-e's support agent's last response to me (keep in mind they also sent tx hashes to other users that blockchain doesnt recognize) - 
Here is the blockchain search for it - 
As you can see, the support agent provided me with a fake hash. This is also confirmed with at least 3 other users on the forums.

BTC-e does not provide support via Skype of any kind. ANY and ALL btce related names on Skype are scam artists. 
Their only support is through 
Straight from the horse's mouth -

It's the truth, though. Only exchanges that implemented their own unique hash ids and didnt pass transactions straight to the blockchain were affected. Again, to reiterate, that's their own custom code and nothing to do with the protocol or reference version of the client itself.
Coinbase and Kraken were unaffected, because they used the protocol in the manner it was intended for, and didn't skirt around it with sloppy code.

I, too, have done several hundred transactions with BTC-e, with only two problems. However, there is something seriously wrong here when they are blatantly ignoring what the blockchain is reporting and providing fake tx hashes. Look at my post above, this is not some FUD attempt to discredit them.

Some guy named TheKoolio. Paulgr is a good guy though.

They just replied with 'fixed' again, and this time the coins had been sent to the address. I didn't do anything different but raise hell on the forums and PM them.

Want to hear the coup de grace? I asked in BTCe's chatbox if anyone else was being selectively scammed, and within 30 seconds, I was banned for 10000 minutes. No joke.

I am also having issues. I have posted about it in the threads linked above, but here is some additional info for naysayers. BTC-e is either selectively scamming, or their system is completely messed up. However, I find it difficult to believe that a support agent can visit a ticket several times and never once notice that no funds have been sent to the destination address.
My initial withdrawal - 
Support's first response - 
Support's second response - 
Support's third (final) response - 
EDIT: My coins have been sent. It took approximately 9 days, 2 support tickets, a few PMS, and some forum posts to finally get it resolved. At this point I'm leaning towards BTC-e's support just being incredibly inept.

Coinbase on a chromebook or cheaper android tablet = complete  Bitcoin POS system for ~$200

My issue has been fixed. BTC-e support replied again with 'fixed', but this time the coins were actually sent to my withdrawal address.
