1st: Who cares what Roger does with his money? It is his money; never tell others what to do with their money. 
2nd: Do all of you really think putting all your money in one basket is a good idea? Everyone should be diversifying their assets.

The author of this article seems to be short sighted.
Yes, not everyone will want to accept bitcoin, but if it becomes widely accepted then you will be excluded from certain trade because of that choice. Almost every vendor accepts credit cards in the modern area even with the fees associated with them. There are no additional fees associated with bitcoin so there in no reason for a vendor to refuse to accept it.
I do agree with the author in the sense that this will take time to gain widespread acceptance, but everyday bitcoin survives, the more the more people will start to trust it.
It won't always be this "mysterious and foreign currency that has only been out there for 5 years" forever, one day it will be that trusted currency that has been out there for decades.

Well when solutions to solve scaling are available and we are purposely delaying them, it does show the weakness in the currency. 
This goes beyond this one problem too, what if every obstacle bitcoin faces takes a year to fix? This does not bode well for bitcoin and I think news outlets are justified in their criticism of bitcoin currently.
@_date: 2016-03-08 00:52:53
Yeah good point. 
I would also just like to see the original bitcoin developers back in control of bitcoin's future.

Andreas' point was that they could ban crypto and if crypto is banned in your country, you have much larger issues in your country than lack of lawful ability to use crypto.

Double spend has nothing to do with my question.

Are full blocks going to prevent users from claiming their coins from a LN channel before the timestamp expires?
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:32:46
Stop talking about Roger Ver.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:35:37
No one knows. You have to make your own decision on this one.
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:35:53
Genuinely curious, what are the tradeoffs?
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:33:27
It's simple. Release the code.
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:50:54
"How can we trust you Luke/Core???"
It is not Luke or Core who make ANY decisions. They write code. It is the community who decides. If you are against this just simply say you do not think consensus will support the hardfork.
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:12:00
People act like SegWit does not increase the blocksize, once everyone is using SegWit transactions the blocksize will increase to 2 mb.
 SegWit is also a softfork which is much less risky.
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:13:01
This is just a proposal. What are you expecting?
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:46:28
Well you might be correct, it seems much more likely mining pools will support a compromise over a minority fighting for a contesious chain split. 
It is time for both sides to swallow their pride and compromise. As long as the agreement stops covert asic - boost and Segwit is unchanged, I can support this compromise.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:36:31
UASF will not work if we have no hashpower. 
The largest pools who signal Segwit signed this agreement.
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:18:30
LOL both communities finally starts to talk about a compromise so we can move past this and Roger denies signing it? 
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:59:35
I let Core do their job which is the program and find technical solutions that are practical. They have build Bitcoin from practically the group up, have touched every button in it, and know what the best technical solutions are.
People have no idea of the technical debt that Bitcoin is. Everything must be bug-free and simple as possible. If they shoot down an idea, it is because it is either difficult or unpractical. So many ideas will sound great on the surface, but require immense technical effort or may have unintended consequences. 
I know I do not deeply understand how Bitcoin works and I do not pretend to. But based on Core's track record so far, I trust them with the future.
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:48:17
He may not be talking strictly in the context of UASF. I think he is just promising to work for both users and businesses in any capacity necessary to scale the network while attempting to dispel the false narrative that Core is stalling progress.
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:12:58
Core can write the code they want and that is their right as this is an open source project.
Core does not own "Bitcoin". If you do not like them, please direct me towards the other options of main net ready protocol upgrades we have available right now.
They said what Segwit was going to be before they coded it. If someone disagreed with Core when they presented Segwit, they should have started a development team then to present their better idea.
But quite frankly, Segwit is our only choice right now.
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:01:08
I guess that is the beauty of Bitcoin, users can make their own choices.
I choose UASF.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:57:42
My understanding after reading this agreement that SW was going to be activated via a softfork very soon and a hardfork in 6 months.
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:54:21
You may be correct, but the BIP 148 is already in motion and gaining momentum. If we are not able to unite, I fear the miners are the ones who truly wield the power in this protocol. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:18:10
Let's not stoop to personal attacks on this sub.
If you do not like someone, stop posting their name and giving them free publicity.
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:12:49
It is.
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:05:26
Nobody is saying /r/ bitcoin does not talk about BU or /r/ btc. But while /r/ bitcoin mostly focuses on gaining support for Segwit, /r/ btc focuses on how horrible Core is, /r/ bitcoin cenorship, and strawman arguments against Segwit. 
 
If /r/ btc hates Segwit so much, they should focus on discussing BU. But again and again /r/ btc proves to be an echo chamber of Segwit/Core hate. 
Check my comment history and compare the tone of /r/ btc  and /r/ bitcoin users.
@_date: 2017-05-21 06:45:36
Bitcoin could go to $0 or it could go to $500k, think about whether the risk is worth it to you.
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:24:01
$0 bitcoin is still possible, unlikely. But still possible. 
Regardless if it drops to below $1 per Bitcoin, I think most can agree that is effectively 0.
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:33:23
This is exactly correct. 
People are saying that lack of scaling is killing Bitcoin when it is hitting all time highs and the network is backlogged because it is so popular. Bitcoin has not been practical for micro transactions for quite some time now, it is mostly used as a store of value. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:39:25
Release the BIP4 code.
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:33:31
Yes you can. But the market prices for each separate coin added will be less than previous bitcoin price.
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:20:57
If they try to redeploy Segwit differently, UASF it is. I will accept nothing less than Segwit as it is and possibly a 2 mb hardfork if consensus permits it.
If they want to activate Segwit all they have to do is signal BIP 148. I am tired of these centralized miners forcing their will on the users. 
UASF is so much bigger than Segwit, it is about the users coming together and proving that this is our Bitcoin. If we do not fight back now, this could be the beginning of the era of the miners.
@_date: 2017-05-21 20:57:36
Please back up your claims with proof.
There is probably a certain degree of UASF astroturfing, but making empty claims is not helping anything.

Personal attacks have become a big the issue in the Bitcoin community. They only distract us from the real issues and cause divides in the community.
It is extremely likely that Segwit would be activated by now if bitcoiners did not alienate the Rogers/Jihans of the world with personal attacks.
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:06:26
The most disgusting part of this agreement is the lack of communication to the community. They just spit out the document with no spokesperson to clear up any confusion. There are just too many unanswered questions from both camps. 
I am all for compromise, but it is impossible to compromise when no one has a clear idea of what is going on.

This graphic depicts the depth of buying orders (in green) and selling order (in red) surrounding the current market price.
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:06:10
This is precisely the issue we have seen with backdoor agreements, no one has any idea what happened because it is held privately.
Then everyone leaves and tells a different story.
@_date: 2017-06-14 03:51:36
Astroturfing much?
