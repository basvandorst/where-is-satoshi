Just left some room for a potential XSS/SQL injection.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:29:43
Would someone like that still use pooled mining?
@_date: 2014-03-24 06:58:48
Please report these ones too!

Hopefully she gets fired soon.
@_date: 2014-03-24 07:30:58
Good idea, I may put together a website soon if I have some time. For now this is a reasonable approach. Hopefully no one will vandalise it.

Doesn't sound like cold storage to me. :O

Hi All,
**Please go to  and report this as a valid phishing attack so firefox/chrome will automatically stop users from going to it. It might just save someone.**
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:04:05
If that were the case he would be more transparent.
@_date: 2014-03-03 08:51:28
We are not entirely sure... We will find out soonish.
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:58:48
*sad realisation*
@_date: 2014-03-24 03:34:10
How did you figure this out? Did you lose coins or know someone who did?
@_date: 2014-03-24 07:42:20
Please report a few of them at: 
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:41:36
Not me.
@_date: 2017-01-07 05:47:23
How long do you think this consideration may take?
@_date: 2017-01-07 05:53:17
Well you can't have all transactions on the chain if the tx is limited and has high fees. However on the chain keeps the decentralization as we don't want people to get Gox'd.
20 cents is already getting too high for transaction fees in my opinion. It's not much for westerners but it goes a long way per transaction in developing countries.

Can you elaborate what part of it you specifically disagree with if you're one of those who oppose it?
@_date: 2017-01-07 06:48:37
I think it should serve as a currency and a gold equivalent. For that to work it needs changes.
@_date: 2017-01-07 12:09:43
Pick one. You likely won't make a profit unless you have free electricity.

Very easy in Australia. Anything that accepts BPay can be paid with Bitcoin. Plenty of restaurants and stores here too that accept it.

Upvoted due to some interesting questions that aren't related to this flash crash most people will forget about in a few years.
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:08:17
Nearly 130,000 YEN!!!
@_date: 2017-01-17 08:05:18
Definitely Australia. There are plenty of shops accepting bitcoin and there are debit card services/ATMs.
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:44:24
Bitstamp, one can not trust the garbage from MTGox.
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:03:27
I need bitcoins to pay my household bills. Also someone I know who never heard of bitcoins needed it to pay ransomware. :O
@_date: 2017-01-17 07:33:58
As always, purchase your VPN with BTC. :D
@_date: 2017-01-07 05:24:35
How would Segwit stop them from making money though? It doesn't increase the supply of BTC. If anything it will allow BTC to scale.
@_date: 2017-01-17 12:39:02
There are a few restaurants that accept it. I have been to some and there is also a site ( that allows you to pay any Bpay bill in bitcoin for free. So effectively you can pay for utilities, home loans etc with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-23 05:10:33
It shouldn't make a difference because Coinbase or one of those companies simply gives them the money from the transaction. Maybe they are seeking advice in the meantime. It wasn't great as Fiverr had a fee anyway for bitcoin which was stupid.
@_date: 2017-01-17 10:31:07
Yes, you can use this site to pay any Bpay payment with Bitcoins. 
Completely free too. That means you can pay for thousands of services like homeloans, utilities, investments and car insurance.
