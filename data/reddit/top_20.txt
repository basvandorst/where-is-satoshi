Something like tether would fill a very useful role if it had a reputable, reliable established business behind it that millioins could trust and had a reason to trust, and was being carefully administered and monitored to avoid inflation, and especially hyper inflation via careful monitoring of the system and 'issuing' their 'money' in based on knowledge and experience as to what the effect of injecting 100,000,000 per day is going to have on the legitimacy of it's 'dollar'
There really is no reason for the crypto community to be allowing these unknown 3 bit players with how much actual experience in how to best handle injecting their 'money' into the crypto economy using an even shadier tool their own exchange. 
What is this company doing to prevent fraud, prevent scammers, prevent corruption from devauling their money? What safeguards do they have in place and have they been tested? The USA had very good reason to build up the belief in their dollar world wide and it was proved over decades to be pretty reliable. These 3 yahoos have done nothing of the sort.  That website and this whole tether inc has so many red flags it's unreal.
As they dump 100s of millions into the crypto ecosystem it's like a patient with a fast moving agressive cancer that could potentially kill the patient.
 Instead of doing what you can to stop the cancer until you can find a similiar tool operated by a well established and trusted and experienced company - to create it's own play money for the crypto community to use - you are defending these clowns with *nothing* concrete to go on that they are in any way actually legitimate.

Dumping 100,000,000 a day in play money will help maintain stability in the market for how long do you think? Heard of inflation? Hyper inflation? 
Also good for you for trusting in bitfinex... not sure there's ever been a more blatantly obvious  fraudulent scam every pulled on a group of people in history but at least you are helping line the pockets of the 3 dudes pulling off this perhaps brilliant scam.

Well because the 3 dudes at tether inc promised they'd deposit the billion dollars in USD into some 'bank' and apparently savvy millionaire investors believe them - no questions asked and hand over millions of their USD for tether - no proof what-so-ever required. Sounds legit enough to me.
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:11:42


Are you a verified customer of Tether? Is anyone? Has anyone ever tried to redeem tether for USD from Tether inc? how would you go about doing that?
Are you aware their TOS holds them completely faultless if they misrepresent anything on their website, and disallows any class action lawsuits of any kind?
Don't you think there is a good reason they do not (or can not?) do business with one of the largest economies in the world US citzens? Because their TOS would not protect them from liability or arrest here.
They've created 450,000,000 in tether in the past 5 days - it's on their omni blockchain and put into the exchanges via their own company bitfinex. 
They buy legit coins like bitcoin with it - then convert that to USD and put that USD in their pocket.
If they continue pumping 100,000,000 every day or even ever week into this ecosystem it's going to crash it hard. I am not sure the exhanges not dealing in tether will even be able to survive such a huge hit to the overall crytpo economy.

what customers are going to 'deposit' millions of USD into a little company of three guys claiming they'll put it into a 'bank' with absolutely no proof of such - that's absurd. 
tether inc - is 'printing' 100,000,000 each day lately - of their pretend money - using that funny money to buy crypto, turing that crypto into USD and putting that money into secret offshore hidden bank accounts - seems pretty obvious to me.


Well bitfinex is owned by the same guys as tether - so clearly a part of the scam - that's the only reason tether is able to stay steady at around $1.00 in the extremely volitile crypto currency world.
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:41:49
Bitfinex is owned by the same people who own tether inc - the ones dumping 100,000,000 of their play money a day onto the Bitfinex exchange, tether then trades it for bitcoin, selling the bitcoin for USD on another exchange and pocketing the real money.
Bitfinex intentionally lists USDT as USD on their exchange - causing many unaware buyers to believe they are exchanging their coins/tokens for real money. Bitfinex is also using wash trading to highly inflate the volume done on it's site every day, and a number of other very shady and fraudulent practices.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:18:29


Well it's not some random on twitter it's the arm of tether reporting how much play money they create using their own in house blockchain 
Interesting how you don't trust 'some random on twitter' but believe the crytpo society should trust these three dudes - bitfinex is going to go down hard due to their other owners also owners of tether dumping massive quanties of their fake tokens on the market at $1 per token. 
I do feel really bad for all those who are going to be hurt by this because they invested more than they could afford to lose... regardless of how blatantly obvious this tether scam is. Just because so many are not educated in how real money works and what inflation and hyper inflation does to an economy doesn't mean they deserve to be hurt.  
Anyone on the other hand who is actively and blindly supporting this company without any sort of proof at all they are even remotely legitimate like you are - hopefully will feel pretty bad for contributing too, and supporting these fraudsters.
If you have any actual reason to believe these guys are legit - how about you put your $ where your mouth is and hodl a significant (to you) amount of tether while they continue to dump 100,000,000 a day into the ecosystem.
You using the postings from the scammers website to 'prove' anything... is a bit beyond me - are you actually that naive that you are under the impression scammers can't and don't lie on their website?
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:31:30


Whole lot of people asking this question. They did have a "interim analysis of our cash position and our issued and outstanding tokens" - but that was looooooong before they started dumping 100,000,000 a day of their play money into the crypto market.
On tether.io's site they say
"hese consulting services do not constitute anaudit (sic) or attestation engagement, which would include a significantly expanded scope of procedures and take substantially more time to complete."
They share a memorandum of a "consultation" done by Friedman LLP (that doesn't actually do audits) here:

Tether will not redeem USDT for USD. Give it a try.


it's printing 100,000,000 a day - it's able to make 100,000,000 a day in 'profits' to deposit from 0.2% 'fees'?
Can you explain to me how you trust in this little company so much to believe they are putting the 100s of millions they are fleecing the cyrpto ecosystem out of daily into a bank account?
Can you explain what sort of educational and experience with economics they have to understand how to avoid inflation or hyper inflation while flooding the market with their $$
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:04:13


Because using USD is slow... using play money is not... that's reassuring - is that because using tether does not use the blockchain but tether's internal one - as centralized as you can possibly get.
It's been said FOREVER 'if it seems to good to be true, it probably is' - there's a reason they are able to move this around at the speed of light with next to no fees - and not because it's legitimate.
Only thing you can't do on a major exchange with USD that you can with USDT is wash trading to make it appear there are millions in volume being traded daily.
63% of all tether is behind held by four adresses likely the 3 owners and one of their shell companies.
So if you believe them dumping 100,000,000 of their play money on such a small economy has no chance of causing serious inflation or evey hyper inflation making their pretend money drop drastically in value - how much do you think IS too much 500,000,000 a day? 1,000,000,000?
As educated as you seem to be in all of this I find it hard to believe you can't see this for the blatantly obvious scam and collusion between bitfinex, and likely a coupe other exchanges and tether. Why would you have blind faith in these three dudes? How much do you actually know about this company personally except what they say on their website - which they themselves say they are not liable for any lies or misrepresentations on.
It boggles my mind that people are actually believing this company has made a billion dollars this year in some legitimate fashion to be backing their billion + play dollars with real dollars. How could they possibly make a billion dollars when they actually absorb the fees of the blockchain and only charge pennies for the tether trades.  
They are simply creating money out of thin air, 100,000,000 a day lately - trading their play money for something of value (bitcoin) and exchanging that for USD thus making themselves a billion dollars in the past year or so - and somehow someway people believe this is legitimate? And blindly believe in these three guys? 
They claim they are being transparent (their laughable balance sheet on their website) and they are-  it's so transparent that they are pulling off one of the biggest scams in world history and are somehow getting away with it while doing it right out in the open and very obviously.
Anyhow I have to go - this has been an interesting conversation - my only hope is that people wake up to this blatant scam before these three guys have sucked so much of the legit USD out of the crypto market that it takes years to recover from the crash they are very likely to cause.

Wow really? I hope you don't actually believe that's legit? 
You seem like a decent person - I hope you don't have anything in this crypto ecosystem right now that you mind losing cause these guys are clearly dumping as much of their play money into the market to pull out legit USD as they can before their house of cards comes crashing down and their "dollars" won't be worth the paper they are printed on... oh wait...
Hyperinflation is a very real thing and has taken down entire countries economies, the more $ they print to try and hold the system afloat the more worthless those $ become in the end. Hence why they end up having to use a wheelbarrow of the $ for a loaf of bread.

Well anyone invested in crypto currency should care - they aren't going to get away with flooding the market with 100,000,000 of fake money a day forever and when there is a billion or two worth of worthless USDT on the exchanges those exchanges are not going to be able to cash out the billions of dollars investors have in bitcoin for USD.  These 3 guys are sucking all the actual USD invested in crypto out of the market and into their pockets.  I'd honestly be surpised if there's even an actual physical  'office' between the two companies tether inc and bitfinex.  This is the most blantant scam I've ever seen and I am totally confused how they are actually getting away with this - decentralized? 3 guys? - isn't anyone who believes tether is somehow legit asking themselves how this company is making 100,000,000 in profits every day to invest in USD to trade for crypto coins?

If you want you can check out the discussion we've been having below in regards to tether
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:46:54


Except anyone living in one of the worlds largest markets - USA can't buy USDT... 
Except you couldn't buy 1000 USD for USDT if your life depended on it. Only way to get USD out of USDT is to trade it something considered actually valuable like bitcoin.
See if you can get tether inc to exchange $10,000 in USDT for USD... gaurantee you won't be able to - they don't accept their own funny money for real dollars lol.
At the rate they are currently inflating the market with their USDT it's going to take a wheelbarrow of USDT to buy one sitoshi by years end. Google wheelbarrow of money - you'll see what happens when they continue being allowed to dump 100,000,000 a day or even a week into the market of their play money.

Sadly these three guys are likely going to get away with this too - no country really has juristiction over cyrpto crimes - I have to assume these guys at least did their research and set up 'shop' (doubt they even have an office between their two businesses tbh) in a country that is least likely to prosecute and jail them for their scam.  They may peg their funny money to the USD But they don't (or can't?) do business in the USA or with Americans, one of the biggest economies in the world. 
I have to wonder how that in and of itself isn't a big enough red flag for most not trust them - they are "backed" by USD but can't or won't do business with the country that makes the USD?  I guess that's to avoid counter fit laws.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:56:50
They've dumped 800,000,000 worth of their 'money' on the market in the past month you do realize that right - money they claim is worth $1 yet they themselves say they will not exchange for real dollars. They are currently dumping 100,000,000 a day onto the crypto market.

At any rate it appears all the negative backlash from people after they were creating 100,000,000 a day, day after day, might have made a difference they went 2 days without doing so which is a good thing to hopefully avoid potential hyper inflation.

In my opinion there's no reason to not believe it isn't a scam.


Didn't know they are back up - last I checked they were down.
That's good that they trade USDT for USD... good for the first few holding 10s of millions in USDT to pull their USDT out of the market due to tether causing hyper inflation. With their insider info they'll likely save their butts. But will kracken be trading those USDT for USD $1 for $1 when tether's crooked business activities cause it's value to drop to .50 or .02 cents? 
Kind of doubtful, I'd imagine after the first few huge withdrawals (final withdrawals of the crooks at tether and bitfinex most likely) that kracken will temporarily shut down to preserve what liquidity it has left.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:11:10
Tether inc (owned by the same people who own bitfinex) dump 100,000,000 of their crypto coins called tethers (play 'money') on the  market / crypto ecosystem almost every day the past week - over a billion of these coins in the past month. They use it to buy bitcoins, trade those bitcoins - keeping the bitcoin prices artificially propped up by using fake money to buy it - turn around and trade their now higher valued bitcoin for USD and pocket the $.  
Bitfinex is doing all sort of other shady things and various market manipulations as well - all of which are highly illegal in the US stock market. 
Thousands, perhaps 10s of thousands of crypto coin holders are allowing this tiny little company (3 man shop) from the Virgin Islands to get away with this because they 'believe' without any proof what-so-ever that this company is legit and the 2.2 BILLION crypto coins they've dumped on the market are actually worth 2.2 BILLION usd. (they've never even been audited tho their site claims they have 'frequent audits')
If you read thro their TOS (which changes nearly constantly) it's such an obvoius blatant scam, tho I am pretty sure all those claiming people are just using FUD know that and just want to keep the masses believing it's real to avoid the inevitable that this could cause. 
Them dumping 100,000,000 a day of their play money (crypto coins) on the market almost every day could very likely cause hyper inflation (google wheelbarrow currency) making their coins that are supposedly worth $1 each worth .01 each on a good day.  
This could cause something similiar to a 'run on banks'  causing bitfinex, bittrex, poloniex and the others exchanges heavily involved in tether's funny money to become insolvent could cause the other legit exchanges to go down temporarily or possibly long term as well. Coinbase is actually fdic insured for any USD held in it's exchange but I don't know what sort of time or hassles it might take to get your money from the fdic.
Here's the kinds of things you'll find on their sites TOS 
Tether must and does at all times reserve the right to refuse to issue or redeem Tether Tokens
Tether assumes no liability or responsibility for any offer, representation, suggestion, statement, or claim made about Tether, the Site, or any Service by any Associate.
anyhow I've been discussing this for days you can check thro my post history last 3 or 4 days - and see what you can find there - use that info to google and do your own research and form your own opinions. I'm not an expert on this subject :)

I guess in the end all those who are foolish enough to be trading items of real value - bitcoin or USD for their play money may deserve what they get for not doing any homework into this shady little 'company' - I just hope if their constant flooding of their play money they are now doing brings them down before they've sucked so much of the real money out of the crypto community that it'll take years for the community to make a comeback.

I can't say which ones you should trust but here's the ones you shouldn't - all those listed here
Those on that page are either in cahoots with or turning a blind eye to what tether inc is doing...
Most especially Bitfinex which is owned by the same people as tether inc (the 3 dudes dumping 100,000,000 a day of their play money onto the market via their exchange Bitfinex)
Coinbase is fdic insured for up to 250k insured (not sure if that applies to non US citizens or not howeveR) - so if they go down when the others do if/when tether causes hyper inflation and a 'run on banks' ie the exchanges - it's likely those with USD in coinbase will be able to get their first 250k back eventually via the insurance.
Be aware tho if you try and withdraw USD from coinbase they can and do limit how much you can withdraw.

Why would institutions, and whales put millions into USDT - why wouldn't they just use USD to buy their bitcoin etc? 
What kind of institutions and rich whales are going to trust in a couple of guys in some fly by night company in some other country - with millions of their dollars?  You think they are that stupid?
63% of all tether are owned by just 4 'addresses' - likely 3 of them the guys behind this whole scam.
'only 525m' of their fake money has been dumped on the market in a month - and this doesn't even concern you?
People talk about crytpo being decentralized and yet one tiny little company with 3 unknown guys who have how much expierence with economics and handling all the aspects of creating money and putting that money into the economy?
Why do you have such blind faith in these 3 guys and their two companies tether and bitfinex? Their TOS disallows class action lawsuits (likely the reason they can't or won't do business with Americans) 
so what's going to happen when their dumping alll their play money on the market causes hyper inflation and their tether becomes worth cents on the dollar? The 1000s or 10s of thousands of people going to individually sue them? Pay for a lawyer and travel to their country to take them to court?
anyhow no idea why you and thosands trust these 3 guys, I wouldn't trust them to handle my uncle, the Nigerian prince's millions let alone having this sort of control over an entire economy.... the crypto economy.
Good luck!!!

@_date: 2018-06-14 02:43:31


Keeping 4 million dollars on an exchange, ESPECIALLY bitfinex/tether inc. exchange is wrong and irrational unless you don't mind losing that 4 million as it is very possible you can lose it all overnight. If you do need that kind dough to trade, you should at least use an exchange much less shady than bitfinex/tether and remove all profits or excess you don't need off that exchange immediately when done w/ that trade.
There's no way I'd put more than 10% of my investment funds into bitfinex/tether inc's exchange to use for trading - the gains are not worth the potential loss if I were to put 50% or more of my investment funds into a less than reputable exchange
@_date: 2018-06-14 07:22:18
Well it's obviously impossible to know to about the majority of the millions of illegal, immoral, or unethical happenings in the crypto world over the last 10 years...
I think it's a reasonable guess to think that less than 1% of all of those have ever had the law catch up with them and end up in jail over their crimes.  Mostly just a few major players with deep enough pockets that it gave our government the desire to go after them to make a huge chunk of change confiscating their crytpo and cash to line their pocket books.
There's no way our government or any other is going to put a bunch of time and resources and money into persuing your average cyber crime, criminal - when there is no money or other political gain in it for them.
But many of the companies that run the sketchy exchanges like bitfinex/tether inc... are shell companies with their business's set up in off shore countries with no extradition treaties w/ the US.
I'd like to know if bitcoin is as good at keeping perminant records of all transactions how come only a couple of all those who've hacked the blockchain or the exchanges never been caught? seems like it'd be easy to find them if its all so easily traced.
The reasaon so few of the crooks and scammers will ever be caught is it's extremely expensive for any individual to persue a lawsuit hiring lawyers in another country and having to create new laws since very few laws are currently on the books in most countries to do with cyber crimes.  
The amount of time research it'd take for a law firm to get the judge / jury to understand all the nuances of crypto and the particular new crimes involc none of them have ever heard of before - would be astronomical - few individual investors have that kind of money to pay a lawfirm, especially since they have no idea if they will end up winning the case or not - and especially if they will be able to collect from that scammer person or exchange or whatever,  if they do

We do? I know that anyone who's worked 'over the table' has an SSN to deal with the IRS
and anyone who's parents applied for public assistance, or they did as an adult has to have one
but that certainly doesn't include 'everyone' 
also this obviously only applies to the USA
not for many countries out there where tons of people don't have identification cards of any kind like a billion or two people in the soon to be most populated country in the world India.
There is another thing you are missing - in order for someone to use the block chain to cast a vote they'd have to know HOW to create an identity to use on the block chain - how many millions of people wouldn't know how or want to learn how to do that

Keeping 4 million dollars on an exchange, ESPECIALLY bitfinex/tether inc. exchange is wrong and irrational unless you don't mind losing that 4 million as it is very possible you can lose it all overnight. If you do need that kind dough to trade, you should at least use an exchange much less shady than bitfinex/tether and remove all profits or excess you don't need off that exchange immediately when done w/ that trade.

back then the bitcoin market was almost all for drugs, human trafficking, extortion, blackmail, and all sorts of ugly illegal things.. 
why would you trust that a market with no rules, regulations, or ability to trace illegal activities etc - would somehow turn into a safe, secure, fair market place that didn't reward the most illegal and scam activities making the most unethical and immoral people very rich. Especially with how difficult and often times impossible to sue anyone who did make a fortune screwing over the rest of the investors in the market.

Exactly!! I would do the same damn thing if some company was not giving me access to even 100,000 bucks let alone millions. 
His agenda could be making sure to give bitfinex the bad name that crooked scam company deserves and perhaps hoping others won't make the same mistake he has - putting all his $$ into one bad basket like bitfinex
tho I hope he put those 500 btc there back when they were only worth  &lt; 100,000  - he'd have to be an idiot to trust bitfinex with millions of dollars w/o doing his due dilligence

decentralized exchanges? 
meaning what?
not owned by one company or a handful of companies working together?
never heard of a decentralized exchange...
from what I know they are all run by a small group of people who can decide at any time to shut down the exchange for a while - keeping everyone with their money on that exchange from accessing their money at a time they most need to...  
that's much more centralized then your average bank that can't just shut down willy nilly and prevent everyone from accessing their funds any time it suits them
anyhow please explain decentralized exchanges - never heard of one

(nobody has to read this - if you have time on your hands and have concerns about what's happening around the globe with central banks 'printing' out their currency expontentially the past decade then you can read this if you want)
I've been studying for a while now what's happening with the US dollar on the world stage. Countries like Russia, India, China, Iran, South Africa and a several other countries no longer have faith in the US dollar as our Fed reserve creates trillions of dollars out of nothing and they all think it's going to crash. So they are going with mutual trade agreements and many nations are repatriating their gold reserves and so on (not going to write a book on this but.....) 
Anyhow people can take many hours and study all of this for themselves - if anyone expresses interest I can give them a few rabbit holes to go down to research all of this.
But I'd just like to summarize what I think might be a good idea....
It's not just slightly possible, but it's likely that the US dollar is going to lose the confidence that keeps it retaining it's every value (dropped by 95% in purchasing power in just over 100 years) based on a bunch of reasons all the things the FED and US gov has done to come to the rescue are no longer available - example interest rate is already near zero... they can't lower interest rates below zero) many other things that they used to have at their disposal they no longer have. So when it crashes it's going to crash very hard and possibly for good. The US dollar could quite literally be worth 0... and it could happen in the next 2-5 years. It may not of course - but I believe based on all I've read it's entirely possible.
You can take time and research all of this...
but I'm just going to put some suggestions out there for you to take or leave - I'm not a financial expert
Anyhow If I had money in the bank for now I wouldn't keep it there... (pay all your bills 3 months in advance or more and then decide what to do with the rest....) 
Honestly the stock market bubble IS going to burst... it might not happen for a year or two... maybe longer but it will happen.  
For now with what I believe is very likely to happen - I'd sell some of my 'toys' that I really can live without for a few years or longer (I can always buy them back later if things don't go south)
I'd use my excess savings, the money I make from my toys (and a few other things I'd also do)
and here is what I would do with that money....
with all my bills paid 3 months in advanced and a small bit of cash... I'd take the rest and protect myself from what could likely be a 5-10 year very very hard time in MOST of the global economy 
Let's say after all is said and done I have $20,000 (just using this cause it's easy to do math on)
I would put 10-20% into industrial grade jewelry (at least 90% pure gold) 
Knowing how often gov's have confiscated gold (and this time you won't be getting '$' for that gold should your gov do this) I might consider putting 10% into gold coins, or perhaps not.
I'd put 20-30% into silver coins, and some silver bars... (there's a massive massive amount of gold in reserves, not nearly as much silver and silver is valuable and needed in industry)
Depending on my experience and faith in Crypto I'd decide a % to invest in Crypto perhaps 10-20% or more.... once the Central banking systems collapse, they are going to have to come up with a new monetary system. While Crypto isn't ready yet - it's possibly the most ready of anything governments and the global economy has to use. While there may likely be a secret plan (or even one non secret that most don't know about) already in place that big banks and the elite controlling eveything have planned. That I am not aware of.
Since Bitcoin is the most established - and if it is being forced to be spent not just saved - it might be the primary crypto in a new global economy. But I am not for putting all my eggs in one basket - so I'd put 1/3 into Bitcoin, and then 1/3 each into two others that are pretty established that might also end up being the new 'currency' or 'money' I won't name the two I'd choose however - because I could be totally wrong and wouldn't want someone to invest real $ in them based on my gut instinct only.
So all together the $ I invest in the above things to protect myself in case the US Dollar collapses and with it much of the tied in global economy... that's between 60-70% of the total
the other 30% I'd put into other assets, small but tradeable required goods - perhaps look into the 'doomsday/prepper' sites and at least get some ideas from there... they've spent years obsessing over what to do in case of something like this so will save you some time.
Anyhow - if bitcoin or another crypto (or more than one) does end up being the solution that governments turn to in some form - the price may not "moon' (since it will be being spent NOT horded) but it would very likely to go up considerably in price...That's what I think - but I could be very wrong.
This is not investment advice really - just sharing what I would do.... if you are investing a considerable amount of money into the above things - you'd obvoiously want to spend quite a bit of time looking into this and see if you end up believing as I do or if you decide 'the US dollar can't fail they can just keep printing more' - or 'our economy has crashed many times and we've done fine' (this time is very very very different for many reasons)
Good luck in your future!
btw -  other than the crypto suggestion - the rest of the $ you spend - you WILL make money on in the long run no matter what. (If you buy assets/goods to use/trade and you things end up fine you can use them or donate them to the needy) and be aware there's manipulation in the silver market - if it does drop - just hang on to it, it will go back up in time.

You lost me, what's 'normal' for bitcoin?
Also I'm no expert on investing but isn't there a lot more incentive to invest 10k on the chance of doubling or trippling your money (but possibly losing it) then there is to invest 25k on the chance o doubling or trippling your money (but possibly losing it?)
Especially since almost everyone says 'only invest what you can afford to risk. 
I think there are a whole lot more people who could afford to risk 10k than there are people who can afford to risk 25k or 40k to keep the market rising at that price range.  
Anyhow personally I can't imagine a senerio  where there are going that be many people wanting to buy bitcoin at 24k or 39k... in order for the price to go up to 50k but perhaps you know something I don't.

Something some people don't seem to get is it was a whole lot more feasible back then that a person could invest $1000 and possibly it blow up someday to $10000 (when people thought it'd soon be used like money everywhere) 
than it is to feasible to go from $10000 to $100000

Why exactly would anyone currently selling or planning too be spreading FUD? that makes absolutely no sense, if they are selling they'd want the price to be going up not down so the'd be shilling for bitcoin and trying to convince others it's going up and other positives about it in hopes it rises back up to the 11k range to sell.
The ones who'd be spreading the FUD would be those wanting the price to drop even more so they can buy 'the dip'

Finance minster Arun Jaitley, in his budget speech today (Feb. 01), stated that the government will do everything to discontinue the use of bitcoin and other virtual currencies in India. He reiterated that India does not recognise them as legal tender and will instead encourage blockchain technology in payment systems.
“The government does not recognise cryptocurrency as legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate the use of these cryptoassets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payments system,” Jaitley said.

Can't imagine someone going thro all that trouble over someone who may or may not have 30k of bitcoin - possibly worth 10k in a few months.
They could just as easily go to say .... a car collectors subreddit and prey on any one of the dudes there who talk about their 400,000 car or perhaps get greedy and prey on one of the ones who mentions their collection of 200-400k cars. Would certainly make more sense then going after some dude with possibly 10-30k in btc.
There has to be another agenda why 30 people here told him this grown man what he should and shouldn't say online  . Way more than told him it wasn't wise to gamble 30k on a coin that's been steadily dropping for a year and is more likely at this time to continue dropping than to suddenly start rising.
I have a few ideas what their real agenda is. They ALL mention constantly they are 'hodling' bitcoin - so clearly it's ok to mention that...sooooooooooooo

My question was how high do you think we can take our national debt
40 trillion? 60 trillion? 100 trillion? 
do you think there is no limit?
how do you think we will pay the interest on that debt at 60 trillion?
if there is a limit to how high it can get - what do you think will happen when we reach it?

'targeted amount of bitcoin' based on your current income and growth of your business...

if it's 2000-2500 for the next year....and 3000-5000 the following year...
or if it's 6000-7000 for the next year and 8000-10,000 the following year?
it's still going to take you 3 years to get your 'targeted amount of bitcion - regardless of the price of bitcoin itself - it's going to take you 3 years to get your 'targeted amount of bitcions'

 let's see... 150k per coin x 10 = 4.5 million? you lost me there...
now lets say 150k per coin x 10 = 1.5 million 
are you actually trying to suggest that this guy who spent 3500 per coin would never sell even one when the price went to 30,000 per coin? wouldn't sell one when they were 50,000 per coin. He's got 500,000 tied up in this investment then and wouldn't sell any of them? And he's not smart enough to figure out he shouldn't keep 500,000 in one wallet that could be hacked? 
There are so many people in this sub who've mentioned buying in back in the early days when they were 1 cent a pop or $10 a pop... or $100 a pop... and make a big deal about hodling....(not to mention the 100s on Youtube who've mentioned having bought in early and still holding who would be super easy to find by a kidnapper)
you really think they'd go after and kidnap this dude who may or may have bought 10 bition and is very unlikely by the time it's gone to 150,000 to actually still have all 10 of those bitcoin
There's over a million millionaires in the USA - and if bitcoin were to go to 100,000 or 150,000 a piece... there'd be a few 100 more billionaires... think kidnappers would have better things to do than go after this guy hoping he really did buy those 10 coins and he still has a few left... 
using the database created by pain_in_the_matrix a kidnapper could find in an hour a dozen here who bought in when they were 1c ... or 10 bucks each and bragged about holding at 20,000 (meaning they were likely to continue to hold a great deal of the 40-400 bitcoin they had here now)
Most kidnappers are obviously more intelligent then some in this sub who think they can brag about buying in at those extremely low prices and still hodling - and this dude who may or may not have bought 10 coins (and may or may not still have most of them when the price hits 50,000)... is more at risk by mentioning that. They'd also have to be sure he never lost his key..or lost them on an exchange...or didn't cash them ALL out at 20,000 or 30,000 or 50,000. Or maybe he kept 1 or 2.... pretty sure a kidnapper going after 100,000 or 150,000 a piece bitcoin would rather go after someone that has 20 or 100 of them not 1 or 2. And since those who bought in at 1c or 100 a pop are much likely to have only sold part of them when it hit 30k or 50k etc than someone who might have bought 10.
And finally regardless of ANY of this a grown ass man does not need 30 different people telling him what he should and shouldn't say online. That's his business. Take a look on youtube or instagram... 10s of 1000s of people a day post things that put themselves more at risk than this guy. Kim K could have literally ended up dead, she's very lucky she's not. 
I know there's another agenda here with 30 people telling him not to tell how many bitcoin he bought. And I'm pretty sure I know what it is. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 23:36:38
I agree with you...
Seems a lot of people don't believe there is a limit to how much we can be in debt... 40 trillion in a few years? 60 trillion in a few more... 100 trilion?
honestly I don't believe it can go on forever - but some seem to believe it will.
When our gov can't even pay the interest on the national debt without charging the middle class AND rich (policial suicide with that group) - over 50% of their income. Things could get very bad and take quite some time for our economy - and the global economy - to make a comeback. Possibly even 10 to 15 years.
So I think you are wise to invest... gold/silver usually stay strong during the worst of times globally. Bitcoin is a complete unknown in that regard - but likely worth at least investing a % of your funds in. (but no more than you won't be crushed if you lose it of course - I am sure you know that)
good luck in the future.
btw if you really believe it's very likely our economy is going to crash - it's a good idea to learn a trade or skill in your spare time that will be of value at the worst of times when most are out of work etc. Bartering for example but plenty of other options.

Ok so out of curiosity, if it's near impossible to spend bitcoin completely anonymous, why have approx 30 different users told this guy he should not have told that he purchased 10 bitcoin. It supposedly puts him in danger if it skyrocket's in price in the next few years. That some crazy might track him down later and hold a gun to his head for his private key.
Presumably at least a handful of those 30 who told him this are experienced bitcoiners. If the crazy hostage taker can't spend the guys bitcoin completely anonymously after stealing his key then what would be the point? 
Also wouldn't that mean that all the hackers who've stolen bitcoin from exchanges and others also be caught if they can't spend them completely anon?

Well my point is - when they are using the cycles of 2011 and 2012 as evidence that these cycles will continue - they don't seem to be factoring in the fact that tons of people back then - thought oh what the hell I might as well toss 100 bucks on this (or 1000 for some) at 1c each - worth taking a chance this bitcoin thingy turns into something someday for that bit of money...
not too different when they were $100 a piece.. a lot of people would have thought - the price went way up last year - worth putting $1000 into this and buying 10 of them where my minimal financial risk is worth the chance.
But if/when the price goes back up to the 6000s or 8000s... not NEARLY as many people will be saying 'worth putting 12,000 or 16,000 into a couple of these - worth the chance that it'll go up in value to where my large risk was worth it.
There is another factor these guys are forgetting when it comes to the previous cycles - as evidence there will be future ones like it.
Those 2011 ... 2012 cycles barely even hit the tech news... certainly didn't hit the mainstream news. So all the 'greater fools' buying in later when it started to rise to 10k and 16k last winter had not really heard about the previous crashes.
This time the massive rise and eventual crash made all the national (and likely some global?) news networks and websites for weeks. and it was all over google trending and youtube all the money people lost.
So there are a lot more now who are aware the money they risk could be lost in months to 50% of what they put in... ie it's true gambling. 
Just one more thing they seem to be missing - there are many legit, long term business's with real assets and well established that went thro these cycles too and ended up going from $500 or $5000 a share to penny stocks or even to 0 in some cases. Bitcoin is more like one of the early dot.com companies than a established business's stock tho.

I was around back in the AOL days - and Bitcoin seems like it might be the AOL of the crypto world...
wonder how many Bitcoin investors have even heard of geocities - back in my day - 99% of AOL users either had a geocities site or at least went to one of the 10s of 1000s of sites daily. geocities doesn't even exist anymore. (there is an archive of some of it on some other business's website)
First to market - like AOL was in its day doesn't always lend itself to long term success... others learn from all the mistakes first to market made to take it down, or at least diminish what it once was to something much less mainstream.
google 'under construction' and choose 'images'  - Bitcoin is still 'under construction' just as 10s of 1000s of geocities sites once were...none even exist anymore. I can't forsee bitcoin ever not existing but like the 100s of millions of baseball 'collector' cards of the 1980s-90s... 1 bitcoin may one day not be worth the ~~paper~~  it was written on.

we can't sustain this extreme rise in our national debt forever
what's going to happen to the US economy when the US gov can no longer borrow trillions to pretend the US gov is actually still working?
what's going to happen when we reach the maximum you think we can get to? 
40 trillion is just a few years away - 60 trillion a few years after that...
at that point over 50% of a workers pay will go just to paying off the interest on the debt and the gov will not be able to borrow more...

it's clearly a cycle... see 2011...2012...
after all it did back when it was pennies a piece to buy it
and dollars a piece...
and a hundred dollars a piece to buy it
so of course that proves it's very likely to do the same when it's 3000 or 8000 a piece to buy them!
Pretty sure there will be just as many people who can buy in at 10k a pop for the BTC as it's rising... as their were during those other cycles buying in at 1c a piece or 100 a pop for BTC... yup
while there may be hundreds of stocks on the stock market who did these same cycles and are now penny stocks...that's extremely unlikely to happen to BTC - right? right? yup! whew this guy is safe to

hell even if you made a few million in 3 years from bitcoin - with how wreckless you are at being willing to gamble almost all your money - you'll end up losing it all on your next get rich quick scheme - scam you gamble everything on lol.
'don't put all your eggs in one basket'
'a fool and his money are soon parted'
but anyhow - good luck to you
sad to think if you invested 50% of that $ into your business - how well it'd be doing 5 years from now..

Well bitcoin is deflationary by nature. It's also the furthest thing from a commodity.
@_date: 2018-12-16 00:49:42
OP is a grown man who CLEARLY likes taking risks he just (he claims) gambled 30,000 dollars in possibly the worst possible ways into something that's been steadily dropping for almost a year with no indications its not going to continue to do so by the day.
Since this grown man clearly doesn't mind taking risks - so don't think he needs 30 people telling him he shouldn't take a risk by mentioning it here.
Honestly I just think there's another agenda for 30 people here to be telling this guy this
I mean 100s of 1000s of people onlne every day make it obvious to crooks - potential bad actors - that they have a lot of money - via Reddit comments, Youtube videos, Instagram post etc. There are a bunch of YouTube videos of people who let it be known they have a bunch of bitcoin... esp all those who mention there (and here) having bought in years ago - see that said here quit often... obviously at 1 cent or $10 bucks a piece they bought more than 10 bitcoins...so pretty much anytime someone here mentions having bought in in 2011 or 2012 are giving these potential robbers much more to consider than this guy who may or may not have bought 10 of them
Not to mention everyone out there driving 400k sports cars flashing their welth everwhere they go... etc etc etc
something about this just doesn't add up... 
can't imagine 5 people running up to some guy flashing his 50,000k gold chain as he gets out of his 400k sports car telling him - dont show that chain or your car - it puts you at risk!!!!
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:58:29
not bad on most of your post, but Bitcoin is not a commodity it has no physical properties.
@_date: 2018-12-13 07:49:08
anddddddddddddddddddddd imagine if you invested 40% of the 80% of your net income you plan to spend on bitcoin -  back into your business for the next 3 years - you are almost guaranteed a nice return on that (inc being able to semi retire at 45-50)
the 40% you gamble on bitcoin - hopefully you get lucky and make a few mill off that as well - if not you've still got your business doing extremely well from that 40% you invested for 3 years
but hey it's your life - gamble it all if that's what you wanna do.
@_date: 2018-12-15 09:26:36
I really really want to know why all of you people are saying this in this thread. Your like the 12th comment in this thread telling this grown man what he should and shouldn't post on Reddit.
How many times this year have I seen one of you mention making big profits off your bitcoin - but I don't see everyone decending to jump on that person or offer unsolicited advice to never ever mention you made big profits on bitcoin. THAT certainly puts you at risk of what you said in your comment. (is it that you guys like people talking about making big profits, cause it entices others to jump in or buy more?)
So what's really going on here? 
There's no reason for any one to believe him enough that he dropped 30k on a gamble. So why would they go thro the trouble of hunting him down for his claimed 10 BTC years a few years from now.
There are 10s of thousands of people on Reddit that one of those criminals could decern have much more money than this dude has in BTC. 
and honestly why is it ok for a dozen of you to all give this guy advice on telling this here - it's not really your business to tell a grown ass man what he should and shouldn't say on Reddit. and there's more advice in this thread on that than those giving him advice on not gambling 30k unless you are rich enough to lose it.
@_date: 2018-12-13 08:09:24

there's over a million millionaires - just in the USA alone... why would they bother waiting years or a decade or two to find this dude who bought 10 BTC to do all your suggesting - they could just pick one of the current millionaires or 1000+ billionaires already out there to do these things too lol.
@_date: 2018-12-13 07:08:43


superior to what? 
to do what?
what exactly is bitcoin doing now that makes it superior


I can take my paper money down to the car lot and drive off in a nice burgandy T-bird... 
so obviously it has value.
hell even tether - supposedly pegged 1:1 to the dollar - won't buy me a T-bird - just the paper money to buy the t-bird (if you could actually exchange tether for paper money which nobody can lol)

@_date: 2018-12-15 10:31:24
and very succesfully I might add
he's got about 25 people telling him he shouldn't disclose he bought 10 BTC... (as if a grown ass man on Reddit needs 25 people telling him what he should and shouldn't post online) 
@_date: 2018-12-13 08:26:45


any idea what would happen to our economy and the value of the dollar - if they just printed out 22 trillion of them next year  (on top of all they already print out next year)

After it gradually dropping for the past year... there is very little chance it would suddenly and instantly make some really sharp rise and stay up 
so if he'd bought a couple today and it did start to go back up again he could quickly buy the other 8 as it started to rise in the next few weeks...yes he'd have to spend another k or two if it did start to gradually rise again in the next few weeks but certainly less costly than had he bought those 2 now and the other 8 if it continues to go down as it has been for most of the past year...
@_date: 2018-12-13 06:45:32
yikes - you got hit on both ends - even in this volatile crypto world - you had some major bad luck... 
I think you have the right idea... don't really think it's going to suddenly sky rocket - so if it does start going up in the near future you can start to buy again then (not suggesting you DO but it's your best option I think... would hate to see you have more bad luck...)
@_date: 2018-12-13 08:02:43
well he's not the sharpest tool in the shed - claims to be planning to invest 70-80% of his net worth over the next 3 years on a gamble.
If he were too put that 50-60% back into his business instead - it's almost guaranteed to pay him back in spade in the years following (with of course rare exceptions on a few kinds of businesses - like some internet startups)
and just put the remaining into bitcoin and a few alts he thinks might hit big.

@_date: 2018-12-15 10:05:38


the market has been going down for a year straight
why is it JUST as likely to shift to going up so **suddenly** that he couldn't drop the other half that 30k in quickly if it showed ANY sign of starting to go up in the next few weeks?
and yes I missed my opporunity to win the lottery because I didn't buy a ticket. So I effectively lossed 1 million last week dammit.
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:35:48
this extreme avoidance of talking about how much BTC you have here- especially in this case with just 10 of them - which could be worth as little as 10k in a month or two is starting to make me think there's another agenda here - at least for some of these people.
That might be that as long as they make it taboo to talk about how much BTC you have here, those with just a fraction of a BTC can still seem to be a big man on campus here since they never have to reveal they only really have 1 or 2 BTC or less.
Not sure what else could explain this mindset to this degree.
I mean for example in car collectors circles people mention their 500k car all the time online (indicating they are pretty weathly making them a target much more than 10 BTC here is worth)
@_date: 2018-12-13 07:04:30


how do you figure this?
a small group of people made a decision and suddenly there were two versions of bitcoin (fork) that totally changed bitcoin as we know it...
and it's a very small group of people who control the exchanges and can manipulate the price of bitcoin any way they wish too - up down or to the ground or to the moon.
if there were no way a group of people could make major decisions on the direction of bitcoin that'd be different
and of course if a couple of the major exchanges goes bankrupt and takes everyones coins down with them - what then?
it's far from completely decentralized - what would people do without exchanges? 
and how can you stop major changes / forks - changes in the way bitcoin's blockchain is handled and what system is used etc?
bitcoin is so open to scams/hacks/billions being lost via exchanges being hacked and so on
besides that bitcoin is just a very tiny % of the worlds available money... I'd guess that the USA prints more $$ in a month than all the bitcoin being held by everyone in the world at this time. It's a very tiny player... controlled by whomever decides what direction it should go next - those who agree will fork those who don't stick to 'the real' 'original' bitcoin whatever that once was and now is... based on the decisions of just a few people.

Well done you left out about 99% of the corruption but nice nice overview.
One key thing they apparently don't teach in school to everyone while the Fed Reserve does create trillions  it's the banks that actually create 92% of the money
I was lead to believe in school that 'fractional reserve' banking meant this:
if you deposit 100,000 in the bank that bank can then lend out 90,000 of your money to someone else say person b
person b deposits that 90,000 into their bank and then that bank can lend out 81,000 
but it's much much worse than that
what really happens is this:
you deposit 10,000 into your bank - then that bank make a loan of 100,000 to person b... (out of think air with your 10,000 as their 'fractional reserve)
then when person b deposits THAT 100,000 to another bank that bank can create out of think air a loan for 1,000,000
THIS is what fractional reserve really means and how banks went from tiny little corner buildings to the biggest sky scrappers in all cities... and how they've made TRILLIONS of dollars in interest
the entire system is so corrupt I could type here for 100 hours and not even begin
the REAL corruption however goes much much deeper 
if anyone goes down the following rabbit hole however, they are going to come out the other end extremely angry... 
the interest rates in this country USED to be determined by the markets...
suppy and demand used to control the economy
the government has given the Federal Reserve cartel (it's not a government agency,the gov has absolutely no control over the Federal reserve cartel (it's not quite a company, not quite a corporation... they did this intentionally so they could call it 'the fed' and people would assume it has something to do with the government, I even have a 50 year old cousin who was a straight A student in college who believes to this day that the Federal Reserve is a part of the government... they are 100% indepentant from the government the only oversite the government has is simply who they put into a handful of seats on 2 of their boards- other than that there is 0 accountabilty
other than not killing the goose that was laying their golden eggs (our economy via their orginal 2 mandates)
they've been given increasingly more power till they now have total control over the US economy in every way... way way more than our elected officials ever dreamed of
anyhow if you want to go down these rabbit holes, realize there's nothing you can do about any of this now... it's just going to make you extremely angry... the best you can do now is figure out when (or if) you think the US dollar is going to become worthless one day and try and plan accordingly (I believe it might be in next 2-3 years but am very sure it will be within the decade, this is after studying all of this intensely years ago and 100s of hours in 2017... but you know you can take a look at look at what's really going on with US treasury bonds now and realize the old 'our government can't go broke they can just make more money' - no longer applies
not when all international investors are dumping all their treasury bonds... (cept a tiny country with less than 5 million people , ireland, nothing to see there right right)
they've been holding trillions of those bonds on their balance sheet, had been dumping them all in replacement for what was left in the social security system, through this intense corruption to keep the interest rates at these absurd rates, they've forced the pension and retirement funds to take them... so ya
basically how many more trillions do you think they can continue to recklessly create when nobody wants them anymore? 
so you can look into all of this - or you can decide when you think it's all going to implode and do what you can to stalk up on silver (if you trust our gov not to confiscate it AGAIN - some gold, or industrial grade gold jewelry - it's never been confiscated in history but don't put all your $$ into that) 
gold will likely take one brief but large drop before it starts moving up - so keep that in mind...
anyhow if you feel like getting very angry start going down  a few of these rabbit holes
google 'de-dollarization' there's at least 13 other countries that know the US dollars days are numbers....
then here's some info on the Federal reserve - and also look into the incredible corrupt rating agencies - moodies etc
I'm not vouching for the 101% accuracy on these two but they are leads to get you started...

Guess you've considered selling some now before it potentially drops to 100s or even 0 and never recovers... and holding the rest in case it potentially goes sky high one day - and you can double your investment with the part you kept?

This is like the 10th time just in this thread that I have read this
but yet day in and day out I see people here saying 'hodl' 'hodl' 'hold' and people saying they are holding
uh obviously they hodl'ing bitcoin right? so you are telling people every time you say that - that you have bitcoin... or are we to assume all these people are only holding a btc or 2 and making such a big deal about holding lol.
so basically anyone here who makes a big deal out of the fact they are hodling - are telling everyone they have bitcoin just as much as this guy mentioning he bought 10.
I can only see someone giving this advice here if someone mentioned buying 100 or 500 of them or something but 10? (actually I can't see giving that advice to someone who says they bought 300 either - they have much deeper problems than hackers if they gamble with that much money unless they are super rich lol)
And really what business is it of the dozen people here telling him this of theirs - if he wants to mention it or not. Seen lots of people here mention they made big profits off selling high - don't see everyone jumping on them for making themselves a target.

and we've had a few - during the Regan admin - it was impossible to find a job for most people - they kept adding extensions to unemployment insurance and giving everyone foodstamps and commodities just so millions wouldn't starve and (in most cases) could at least afford a place to live
and not that long ago many millions were out of work, and millions lost their homes - of which their life savings as tied up in equity in many of those cases.
also during the Clinton years we had a balanced budget
now we have 22 trillion national debt and rising astronimically over the next few years to 40+ trillion...
so ya we've had some very bad decades - certainly makes sense to predict we are heading for another - I can't see us being able to sustain a 50 or 60 trillion dollar national debt - how would we even pay the interest on that? Insane tax hikes?

Well I could see the advice to 'not tell how much you have publically' IF it were like 500 or 5000 bitcoin but 10? lol
10 bitcoin might be worth only 10k in a few months. Most adults have 10k of something or other.
@_date: 2018-12-15 09:21:17
You know what's funny - they are telling this guy NOT to mention he bought 10 BTC and in the same breath saying they don't believe him.
Some guy who legit has say 2000 BTC could come here and shout it to the rooftops and be pefectly safe in doing so - cause nobody here would believe it. Not 1 person lol. So he'd be safer than someone who lies and says they bought 50 of them.

is that when people were buying BTC for pennies or dollars? bit different when they are spending 3000 or 7000 a pop for them isn't it?
@_date: 2018-12-15 16:51:05


Well obviously not.There's a pretty big difference between telling someone on a bus how much physical cash you have in your pocket. And mentioning on the internet how many BTC you have (within reason - obviously if you have 1000 BTC you'd probably be a fool to mention it online, because like anyone else on Reddit who say something to indicate they are very weathly, they'll end up with stalkers looking for ways to scam them out of some of that money.
At any rate I really don't think its appropriate for 30 of these guys to tell this grown man what he should and shouldn't say online in regards to his financial situation. Anymore than all the others here letting potential hackers/stalkers know they also have bitcoin by sharing very publically that they are 'hodling'
Besides the fact if this fool really did drop 35k on a gamble at this precise point in bitcoins history... he has much more to worry about in his life/future than mentioning he did so.
At any rare if there are hackers/stalkers watching this sub - they are much likely to target those who've been saying for some time now they are 'hodling' - than some dude who claims to have just bought 10 coins. Because those who've been making that comment for a while here are much more likely to be telling the truth than this OP. So more worth their time to pursue hacking, stalking those people should btc skyrocket in price in the next few years.
@_date: 2018-12-13 07:38:25

don't they already have a mETH coin?
@_date: 2018-12-16 23:11:10
perhaps 
but seems to me it'd be pretty silly to be bragging and making such a big deal out of 'hodling' if your only holding 2 or 3 btc - so the assumtion would be you likely have more - and they'd have more reason to believe your legit since you've been here for a long time and mentioned it a # of time than this guys story...
and also it's kinda obvious isn't it all the people who say they bought in all those years ago... why would someone spend 90 cents on bitcoin... seems more likely they'd have spent 10 bucks or more and gotten 50 or 100  or something
so - making a big deal about hodling - or going on about how you bought in way back when they were .1 cent or 10 bucks each - is more risky then this guy
so dont think he needed to be told 30 times 
@_date: 2018-12-13 08:46:15

@_date: 2018-12-16 02:30:17
Well unless or until the bitcoin community is willing to start being flexible and willing to grow/change and adapt as a group there are going to be major problems with mass adoption of it as a currency in any sort of manner.
I think it's entirely possible that bitcoin will be successful - and that all those who took a gamble and bought in will profit if they are careful, and use caution and their brains in their choices.
But I do think it is at least possible that it may never reach critical mass and be used on a large scale world wide, and also think its at least possible that it may never go back up to some major extent - such as up to 18-20k so all those who bought in at that price who didn't want to sell and take a loss can at least cash out and break even.
Good luck to you and your future!! :)

Well OP is a grown man, don't think he really needs 30 different Redditors telling him what he should and shouldn't say online. Really not their business.
And if they really are 'concerned' about this OP enough to post this same advice 30 times in one thread... then why aren't they just as concerned about all the other postings, sharing that they also have bitcoin by them mentioning ALL the time they are 'hodling!' - that's telling that they have bitcoin as well. Sharing that you are hodling bitcoin and making a huge deal about that - seems to be highly encouraged here, yet 30 people care about this guy mentioning he is now hodling as well. Very odd and suspect to me.
There are many many Redditors who've mentioned something on Reddit that indicates they are wealth which would seem more enticing to some crazy who'd want to harm them for profit, than some dude who may or may not have actually bought 10 BTC. That would include all the bitcoiners in this sub who've bragged about the huge profits they have made in bitcoin.
Seems some of these youngsters in the bitcoin arena have never heard the term 'mind your own business' - or we wouldn't have 30 people telling this guy what he should and shouldn't say on Reddit in regards to how many btc he owns/bought.

except for the 1000s of people a day who have to put air in their tire at a gas station at $1 a pop these days. 
(but I know what you are saying - just being silly)
But bitcoin is far far from scarce there are millions of them and those can all be divided into billions of  smaller units. Kinda like the 'collector' baseball cards in the 1980s and 90s. They printed out millions of each and the kiddies thought they would EACH be worth something some day. At least each of the millions of beanie babies were worth something for a few years there.

Well these guys are talking in this thread about someday when these 10 bitcoin might be pretty valuable some guy holding a gun to their head to get their private key....after going thro the trouble of finding the person (not even knowing if he actually has the 10 coins or was lying on Reddit)
But if they were to do the same stalking of a dude with a collection of super expensive cars - they could just as easily hold a gun to his head and make him wire a million or two or whatever to his swiss bank account.
I mean this is just an example...
Us gals put our lives at risk every time we go for a walk or leave somewhere by ourselves...
this guys chances to get physically confronted in the physical world because he may or may not have 10 bitcoin...
well so many of the people in this sub say they are hodl'ing bitcoin... and it's much more likely for those who've been saying that long term here ...legit have the bitcoin... than this poster.
So why do we have 30 people in this thread telling this guy not to tell that he has 10 bitcoin...  - when there are dozens of others here saying daily they are hodling bitcoin...
obviously most of them have more than 1 or 2 of them or wth would be the big deal about them 'hodling' till the moon and all the other sayings they say about hodling. Would be pretty silly for them to be saying that about a few satoshi's lol.

Thanks for taking the time to give such a detailed answer. Explained it pretty clearly for me :)

I am with you there - asteroid mining is the next big thing - didn't you know! We better sell our gold before the masses find out! 
I think Bitcoin is  more like diamonds than gold. There are millions of diamonds out there but their are people who tightly control and manipulate the market to keep the price of diamonds high. As long as that continues in perpetuity it's all good. And it likely will  - with the money there is in diamonds anyone trying to flood the market with diamonds wouldn't live long. But there really isn't one single group of players with really tight control over the entire bitcoin market so there-in lies the difference...any group of players could flood the market with bitcoin.

Ya but this poster is giving some decent advice.
At the very least the guy should sell back half of them... and put the other half in if the price drops another 1000 or whatever. If it does suddenly start to rebound at this point then he could quickly put the other 5 back in before it rises much. (not that he should gamble that much but he already has so he could rethink and do it this way - less risky at least)
@_date: 2018-12-16 02:21:24
hmmm didn't say bitcoin would drop to 0 but it's certainly not next to impossible like it would be Amazon stock dropping to 0 in the next decade.

A group recently did a study on this - and they couldn't find one that had many users using any blockchain tech :)
Sorry can't think of the name of the group - but I can try and find it if you want to know and can't find it via a google seach. (might be hard since I didn't give much to go on to find it)

I'm a gal... I take serious risk every time I go for a walk... don't even live in a very safe neighborhood these days - so that's scary.
For any of you crazie stalker masked men reading my posts at a future date.
I'm selling my 363 of my BTC as soon as the price drops to 3200... which should be in the next few minutes...
so don't waste your time stalking me... thanks :)

Well there was no 'open internet, aka www when AOL started, except for the extreme computer savvy, and government and large corporations, and a few uni's. AOL did open up to the internet (IRC, and then the www) and it's users fled en mass from it's expensive $1.95 per hour structure, to the free (less your montly dialup costs of course) IRC and www
AOL quickly tried to adjust by going to a monthly fixed rate not an hourly rate, but it was too little too late. 
Not sure why you think Bitcoin is like Facebook... most younger people these days wouldn't touch Facebook with a 10 foot pole and laugh at the old foggies who use it. Besides the fact anyone can use Facebook with next to no computer experience and a few clicks of a mouse, which is part of why it grew to such a large userbase. Buying, selling, trading and spending bitcoin safely, and securely STILL 10 years later requires you to have a great deal of computer savvy and understanding how to do so. Certainly not something most barely computer literate people can do safely. And the millions of small business's out there today, have no easy, very secure, way to quickly and easily set up a way to accept bitcoin from it's users/customers - and vendors, creditors - especially w/o the use of the very risky exchanges in which any $ you have on there could go poof in an instant.
The main reason I suggest that Bitcoin seems a lot like AOL in it's early days... is because so many couldn't see or realize AOL was just the beginning, not the end of getting the globe to mass adapt to an online environment.  Netscape did that really... among other later companies/technologies

FMA of a cashless society clearly goes to Mastercard/visa - they many years of getting established and major corporations backing them and millions of companies around the world that accept them.
Bitcoin has a few advantages that Mastercard/visa don't and Mastercarde/visa have a number of advantages that Bitcoin doesn't.

10 BTC worth millions? There are like a 17 billion btc that means bitcoin be worth more than all the money on the planet today and then some lol.

Curious why so many of you at least 15 in this thread - are telling this grown ass man what he should and shouldn't say online.... seems more important to all of you than telling him he shouldn't gamble with 30k unless he's really rich.
Why aren't you guys all running around like busy beavers telling all those here saying they are 'hodl'-ing not to tell anyone that cause that's letting strangers know they have Bitcoin? 
Or telling all those here who brag about making big profits in bitcoin they shouldn't share that - it's making them a target.
Oh right - guys here hodl'ing benefit from others who say they are too...
and guys here benefit from those bragging about making big profits...
so no reason to tell either of them they shouldn't disclose they are holding BTC or made a bunch of money selling BTC

They'd probably be busier going after people with 100 or 1000 or all the people keeping their BTC on exchanges...
@_date: 2018-12-13 08:49:15
purchasing bitcoin is one thing 
but don't keep your coins on any of those exchanges - any of them can be 'hacked' of 100s of millions at any time - and most are sooner or later (or so they claim)
@_date: 2018-12-15 11:45:05
why does he need to prove anything to you
? does he even know you? lol
he's either an idiot... or lying - why does it matter which to you?
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:35:15
Yup we are doing just fine...


@_date: 2018-12-15 10:36:07
I'm curious - what about this statement:


isn't accurate or is shilling?
As long as so many are pushing hodl hodl hodl instead of spend spend spend - how is Bitcoin ever going to become an actively used currency... and the longer it takes for that to happen - the slimmer the chances of it's success as a currency.

all this over him mentioning having 10 btc? people risk a whole lot more just using these exchanges where they could lose all their btc in an instant or holding tether that could be worth 0 in an instant
if people wanted to put this much time into this - wouldn't they be targeting those with 500 or 5000 BTC not some random dude who may or may not have bought 10 BTC? sounds like a whole lot of stalking work when they would have no idea if this guy even actually bought the BTC or is just trying to humble brag that he has 30k to drop on a gamble.
