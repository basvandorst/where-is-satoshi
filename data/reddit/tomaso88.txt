file a complaint on what i had no funds stolen
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:33:35
in my opinion anyone with btc has possibly lost money. Just like you i had no money on bitfinex but the fact all this is happening and the outcome of it all could effect the price of bitcoin and other currencies such as ethereum
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:30:32
For just so many reasons it's not funny.
 1. the only reason the ethereum network agreed to do it is because it was still a young currency and they didn't want it damaged before it has had time to shine i doubt they would ever do a hard fork for a situation like that again.
2. majority of bitcoin members are against hard forks for situations such as this it may sound like a dick thing but bitcoin is suppose to be decentralised, the second you do a hard fork for something like this you are showing centralisation of the currency.
3. we don't want a situation like eth where you have etc and eth.
4. the hacker could move the bitcoins before a hard fork could take place unlike with eth where the hacker couldnt move the funds yet.
i dont really need to go on there are just so many reasons why a fork would not work

I imagine insurance prices for you may go up now to because of the bitfinex hack though I could be wrong. good to here a REAL business working hard on the future of there company unlike many other exchanges keep up the excellent work

WHY this sounds like an inside job.
1. this would be a good way to pump bitcoin if they sell everyones atl currencies.
2. it's a good way for them to trade the bitcoin they stole in to alt currencies

it honestly sounds like it was an inside job and he is being fooled by his own company

I think his asking as in why he said "is someone" and just speculation since the price dropped just then
@_date: 2016-12-30 05:06:51
Better to have more bitcoin moving around then less. Creates more of a distribution of the coins so we don't just have a couple of large money baggers.
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:56:10
If the person is indeed selling them this is extremely good news. since it shows those bitcoins were not on a lost wallet, and are being distributed back in to the market. though not sure why someone would sell so many when the price is expected to go up, unless they expect a drop in value

They know how it happen
