I understand what you mean, I still enjoyed it.
@_date: 2019-03-29 05:48:57
I stopped using them a while back! Don"t like how they are acting in this industry!
@_date: 2019-03-26 04:53:25
It agree  with you, my native language is Estonian I'm fluent in Swedish. Still it's much easier for me to explain bitcoin in English. Still It would be good to have a list of bitcoin resources in all languages in one place. The plan is to get this up on GitHub.

Sorry it's been quiet for a while. I'm still working on this project. We also have Didi from The Bitcoin Family offered to be an ambassador for the project.
@_date: 2019-03-30 07:09:01
The best thing I have seen for along time :)

Very well written. Hal 's work needs to be brought forward. There is so many people that don't know about what he has done for online privacy and bitcoin. Looking forward for your next write up :)

That's great news!
@_date: 2019-03-29 11:54:05
C'mon it's a funny cartoon for adults :)
@_date: 2019-03-26 02:25:29
Thank you buddy! I really hope we can get some more comments here to build a resources list for everyone.
@_date: 2019-03-25 13:38:19
Thanks buddy. I'll have a read through them :)
@_date: 2019-03-25 10:02:20
Ha ha ha that's great, still the car looks awesome :)
@_date: 2019-03-28 06:58:31
Ha ha ha!
@_date: 2019-03-25 13:50:06
Good articles. Keep them coming :)
@_date: 2019-03-27 03:22:51
It's sad that more people don't want to get involve in this, on twitter I got much more encouraging comments. And a few people who are willing to work on this with me. Hope more will join in :)
@_date: 2019-03-29 05:51:57
Sorry to say they are not any different from banks. They have the license to act like bullies (bitlicense) Get your money out and find a better option. Don't forget to delete your account.
@_date: 2019-03-25 09:50:27
Sorry for being quiet on this post for a while. There have been some interest and request for the bar but nothing I consider serious at the moment. I'll keep working away and keeping my head up.
@_date: 2019-03-28 07:01:27
Very good documentary!
Here is another good one, The Third Industrial Revolution: A Radical New Sharing Economy [ 
@_date: 2019-03-28 11:45:30
Agreed, we need more people to understand the value of sound money.
@_date: 2019-03-28 04:59:43
Well said!
@_date: 2019-08-03 11:05:52
Well said
@_date: 2019-08-03 11:06:33
What is this?
@_date: 2019-08-07 09:52:45
@_date: 2019-08-17 12:25:39
They should get some bitcoin instead of usd
@_date: 2019-08-10 05:44:25
Nice, good to get another good player in the space
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:59:51
Nice, we need more places like this!
@_date: 2019-08-23 08:55:48
Great response
@_date: 2019-08-07 09:53:55
Yep, I choose bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-08-07 09:51:38
Both of them are manipulating their currency prices!
@_date: 2019-08-03 11:07:59
There is no reason to trust the governments when it comes to monetary policies, they have proven this time after time. Better you bitcoin and be in control!
@_date: 2019-08-07 09:53:11
Yep, he is awesome!
@_date: 2019-04-11 02:46:29
This is awesome!!!!
@_date: 2019-04-09 10:06:59
I got one too, be careful out there. Never give away your key or bitcoin to anyone. Don't trust verify!
@_date: 2019-01-19 06:39:02
That's great :)
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:44:00
Thanks for the heads up :)
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:57:02
Hope you can sell that ;)
@_date: 2019-01-19 06:41:22
C'mon you are the one being rude.
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:40:47
It's not 130K USD. It's 35 Btc.
@_date: 2019-01-19 09:48:49
No it costs 35 btc ;)
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:46:08
I would not sell the bar for gold, only btc :)
@_date: 2019-01-11 12:33:45
Thanks buddy. That's idea to keep the banks, corporation and the governments far away. We want to interact with them as little as possible and earn our freedom.  
@_date: 2019-01-20 01:58:47
Ha ha ha, nice one! Thanks :)
@_date: 2019-01-19 09:49:27
Where is that standard?
@_date: 2019-01-19 06:09:37
Good luck finding that :)
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:46:20
Thanks bud!
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:24:59
No it doesn't. It cost 35 Btc. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:55:11
@_date: 2019-01-19 08:16:53
True, but that's how you build a successful business ;)
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:47:16
Thanks for your expertise. Do you offer professional services?
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:38:37
Have a look through the articles and videos we have been making, this was an idea of having some fun with bitcoin culture ;)
@_date: 2019-01-18 13:01:29
Hey buddy. I have scribbled down some ideas in a article, writing is not my strong side ;)
I have not addressed all the thing that could possibly go wrong and right. And I don't have all the answers, but I'm ready to start, and I have the passion for this kind of life style where freedom is the key. as soon as the bar is sold :) [
Right now there is me and my friend planning this together, hopefully we can attract people to join and/or build their own communities.   
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:40:20
That's true :)
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:48:29
Looks like you need the  satoshis more than I do ;)
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:54:57
Yes Didi is my good friend, we meet last year during a bitcoin meetup in my bar. He is a great inspiration! We are both in this video talking about mining and after Didi made a great presentation about bitcoin in our meetup.
@_date: 2019-01-19 06:08:47
Great hope my mother made you happy! And you don't seem to have that much experience  with bars.
@_date: 2019-01-19 06:10:51
Sweet :)
@_date: 2019-01-18 13:08:00
Thanks buddy. I'll keep you update on the progress :)
@_date: 2019-01-19 06:05:49
That's true it's a lot of money and working 16-18 hour days to make it successful :)
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:44:44
Thanks, my body and mind can't take any more drunk nights :)
@_date: 2019-01-24 04:31:32
How so? Ex. you buy a bottle of vodka for 10$ and sell cocktails for 5$, mixers and shots for 2.5$, for ingredients you'll spend 0,5$. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:41:55
That's right you will need a Thai partner in the company.
@_date: 2019-01-20 01:49:49
Sorry bud, I wish I had :)
@_date: 2019-01-19 06:50:12
As you can see we are in the jungle :) [
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:23:22
What gang?
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:57:51
I would only transact in a way so both the seller and buyer have security!
@_date: 2019-01-19 06:01:29
Thanks for all the comments, and to all the keyboard warriors out there. I love you guys :)
@_date: 2019-01-13 02:35:15
Sorry buddy, I don't know what you are meaning with citadels. Can you explain?
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:24:17
Don't even know what you mean.
@_date: 2019-01-20 01:49:22
I will happily donate to a charity ;) 
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:39:53
No you are not confused. We have a large expat community around us, most of them have been there for over 10 years and they like our bar :)
@_date: 2019-01-11 12:45:29
Thanks buddy! We are working towards the same goals! I'm glad that there is more like minded people out there. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:43:02
Thanks buddy! Did we get drunk together?
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:33:49
What country are you talking about? I guess this would be in Europe or US.
@_date: 2019-01-11 13:44:25
I am truly humbled by your reactions! This will inspire me to keep on working. Thanks guys :)
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:45:06
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:42:28
Sorry buddy, you have your numbers wrong ;)
@_date: 2019-01-11 12:44:31
Awesome! I'll send you a PM shortly :)
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:23:44
I really hope not.
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:43:36
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:32:23
Sorry bud, where do you find fixed cost?  Liquor has over 100 % margin, beer, wine and food have a margin of 50 %
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:56:24
That's true, after 9 years my body and mind can't take it anymore. I'm a true believer of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:36:38
We use the B for shortening Thai baht  ;) 
@_date: 2019-01-19 08:25:11
Welcome to the real world  buddy ;)
