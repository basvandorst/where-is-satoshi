Yep, try this integration for adult-related businesses:

That's not actually correct.  You don't have to convert the bitcoin payments into fiat.  You can keep the amount in 100% bitcoin or a mix of bitcoin and fiat - whatever the merchant prefers. :)

Yes!  But it depends on the size of your keys and your access to a sufficiently sophisticated quantum computer.  The largest key scheme publicly broken to date has been 112-bit (prime field) but since you're posting here in I'll assume you are referring to 256-bit key.
A private EC key is simply a random number in the range of 1 to n - 1, where 'n' is the order of the curve.  In Bitcoin's case, the curve used is secp256k1 so the 'n' value (in decimal) is: 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337.
However, even though the private key is simply a random number, the public key is not - it's the elliptic curve point that corresponds to the private key based on the formula P=nQ.  To obtain the new point, you multiply the base point 'Q' with the private key using elliptic curve scalar multiplication which includes several expensive mathematical steps.  This creates a mathematical "trap door" where it's easy to go one way through (P=nQ) but practically impossible to go the other way and obtain the original n.
But, all is not lost!  If you had access to the original machine that created the keys you're trying to break, you could ask the machine to generate more keys for you and, by watching the power used by the CPU and also timing the software itself, you could apply computationally-inexpensive statistical methods and possibly recover the original private key.  On the other hand, if the developer who wrote the EC key generation software running on this machine was aware of power &amp; side-channel attacks and used algorithm(s) resistant to these attacks, it could make it a lot more difficult.  Other more sophisticated methods to find the key exist but the limitations of current computer technology mean that your victim's 256-bit private key is safe for now. ;)
It's a really good question, by the way!  There are many places in my answer here where I could (should even) qualify certain statements, but I tried to keep the number of asterisks down and go for readability.  If you're really interested in learning more about this though, here are some terms to get you started: Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem, Diferential Power Analysis, Timing Attacks, Pollard's rho algorithm.

I'm a tad biased of course and recommend BitPay.  :)
Seriously though, my team produces/maintains our ecommerce payment plugins/libraries so I'm aware of the work put into them.  I wouldn't hesitate to say I've got some of the best software engineers in the company!  If you do go with us and need any help with one of our products, feel free to email me: rich

Congrats!!  Love seeing bitcoin being used :)
@_date: 2015-06-03 20:19:28
This is a good idea and I'd be happy to work with these guys to make it happen! :)
@_date: 2015-06-18 20:26:52
Awesome!  I'd love to help out with your course, if needed! :)
@_date: 2014-01-31 19:27:45
Fascinating read, thank you for posting that!  Strictly from a critical point-of-view, you use the word "anarchy" or a form of it 13 times throughout the paper.  I don't know if I agree with that interpretation of the currency and/or movement.  Satoshi Nakamoto never mentioned the word (or a derivative) in his 2008 whitepaper.
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:55:49
Yeah man, anything I can do to help just let me know!
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:33:08
Yeah, but we wanted to promote the Bitcoin community instead of just our company.  Don't worry - you'll see the Bitpay logo around, though.
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:54:32
Drop me a line and I'll forward your email to the project manager for our political and non-profit merchants: rich  All accounts should be converted to the correct plan.  If there is an issue, we will get it straightened out for you!
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:51:04
Maybe one day we will sponsor the Rose Bowl, who knows?  At the end of the day this is still a bowl game and it's huge for the Bitcoin community.  I'm pretty freaking excited myself!
@_date: 2014-07-30 17:21:19
Definitely!  Still the same daily payouts if your account meets the minimum payout threshold.

Hey, I'm the plugins maintainer &amp; PHP developer at BitPay.  I'm happy to look into this issue for you.  Although I'm pretty new to the company, I'm not familiar with any support issues related to your site.  If you email support and include the ticket # where you've written previously, I'll grab those and get back to you right away.  (Plugin-related tickets are routed to me.)
When you write to support, include the version of Magento you're using, whether or not you've grabbed the latest version of our plugin and attach the log file.
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:31:22
Go for it!  :D
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:50:42
Oh wow, that's great!  Nice work!  :D
@_date: 2014-03-02 15:33:25
Yes, I can vouch that CalvinHouse does not work for BitPay. :)
This is a great post, though.  I knew we had some employees going to SXSW but wasn't aware this charity had signed up with us.  (However, I'm not in marketing or account management.)
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:22:28
BitPay is not a wallet and strictly a merchant payment processor which allows merchants to offer the Bitcoin payment form on their website (or brick-and-mortar store) and receive fiat currency or a mix of Bitcoin/fiat.  You've got to understand this is super important to business that may not really care about BTC philosophy - they simply want to be able to sell their products to a larger market that wants to pay with this currency.  This is a Good Thing!!
So the "decentralization" argument really doesn't apply here.  We're not the Central Bank of Bitcoin...  You're absolutely free to roll your own Bitcoin network interface and shopping cart plugins.
@_date: 2014-07-31 14:35:35
All of our monthly plans include free and instant conversion to your settlement currency- no percentages. You will be paid the amount you charge.  See: 
@_date: 2014-07-30 17:17:45
Let me know if you need some help with the integration!
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:57:56
Hi, I'm the ecommerce plugins developer at BitPay.  I've reached out to them to work on an official solution.  At the moment, if you can copy/paste HTML snippets, you could use our various payment buttons generated in your customer dashboard.  Send us a support email if you run into any technical difficulties implementing these!  I'm here to help.
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:31:00
Our standard account is free.  We still have our enterprise plans that aren't.  If you're a Mom and Pop store that wants to use our plugins for your shopping cart and are happy with our excellent email support, then you're good to go.  If you're an enterprise customer that wants value-added options like custom integration from our Engineering staff, phone support, dedicated account rep, etc. then it's not free at that level.  See: 
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:05:41
Definitely, you're welcome!  I'd love to have your input and contributions on our open source .NET offerings.  Our GitHub code repository is located at 
I'm an engineer and sling code all day so the financial area of our business is not within my domain.  If the business team sends my team an integration project (like a plugin for Super Big Ecommerce Platform (tm) for example) we pick up the development from there.
Sorry - I'm not trying to be intentionally ambiguous with my answer.  The sales/marketing team will be holding an AMA later to answer everyone's questions surrounding this announcement, though.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:33:57
Thanks!  Send me a message with your contact info and I'll put you in touch with our recruiter.

Yeah, no problem!  I'm sure our marketing department has more information they could share with you on the growth of Bitcoin, btw.  Send me an email (rich and I'll be happy to forward your questions to them.  Good luck with your essay!  :D
@_date: 2014-07-31 14:41:12
Hey BitNomadic!  According to our support article here ( we support direct bank deposits in 33 different countries.  Send an email to info with your specific country and those guys will get back with you.  :)
@_date: 2014-01-31 03:32:29
If you wouldn't mind the shameless plug here, we have some great materials on our website that you are welcome to share with the local businesses.
Whichever option you convince them to use, it will be cheaper all around when compared to credit card payments.  Not to mention daily bank settlements.  The businesses could offer more services to the tourists if they were saving the money on bank and CC provider fees.  More money would stay in the community.
If you don't have one, start a bitcoin meetup!  (If you start up some meetings and I'm in the area, I'd love to stop by and have some coffee.)
Thanks for supporting &amp; promoting bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-07-30 17:20:42
To be fair though, companies looking for enterprise engineering services aren't trying to save $30/month on payment processing... ;)
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:25:07
@_date: 2014-07-30 17:16:55
Not really any limitations.  The free account has unlimited processing and still has access to all the regular plugins/libraries and email support: 
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:43:53
According to the marketing folk, we will definitely have a commercial.
@_date: 2014-07-30 17:32:46
It also includes engineering services for integrating your enterprise commerce platform with our gateway.  I'm not doing your laundry though. ;)
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:18:02
Well, from a business viewpoint, the question isn't whether or not she should accept Bitcoin.  The question is whether or not she wants to increase her revenue.  Accepting Bitcoin is free through our platform and gives her another method for customers to spend money on her site.  Bitcoin users are enthusiastic about new companies jumping on board!  But, hey, I'm biased I suppose.  :P  Good luck!

Point out that the bitcoin market cap is around $12B ( you have big institutional investors in the game and people are supporting their families working for Bitcoin-related companies (like BitPay and our merchants).
It's a pretty valuable and important non-thing to a lot of people! ;)
@_date: 2014-07-31 14:44:42
Yeah, send an email to info and they'll put you in touch with the right peeps!  Thanks for supporting and using Bitcoin in Puerto Rico!

@_date: 2014-06-16 13:31:01
Technologies to make payments easier are definitely being looked at and discussed internally.  On the flight to IRCE last week, Andy P. and I sat next to each other on the plane and talked about this very topic!  He is very excited about ushering in the next generation of tech to do this very thing and had a lot of notes to go over with me.  Send him an email if you have some concrete ideas yourself!
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:07:21
1. Yes, correct.
2. Eh, not completely accurate but close enough I suppose for the purposes of your essay.
3. True.
4. True.
5. True.
Not sustainable:
1. What mining problems? Mining has shifted to being larger scale operations, yes, but if you are referring to the difficulty factor that is operating as intended.  You must have miners for transactions to be processed.
2. That's not an issue with Bitcoin, that is an issue with buggy/insecure code (in the case of companies) or people not protecting their wallets properly.  If I take your wallet from your gym bag because you left it sitting on a bench while you worked out, do you blame USD as a currency or do you blame yourself for letting your wallet sit out in the open like that?
3. That's just market dynamics.  Speculators will speculate.  The rule - for ANY market, not just Bitcoin markets - is to not risk more than you're willing to lose.
4. I don't know where you're going with that.  Apples != Oranges.
5. Yes, that is a good point.  Some banks have closed accounts because their customers have traded Bitcoin.  I don't know how much of an overall impact that has had on the Bitcoin community as a whole, though.
6. That's not necessarily going to contribute to unsustainability.  Re: SEC regulating the stock market provides a safer place for people to trade stock by setting rules on how things are traded (but, of course, that doesn't mean that it will apply or work the same with Bitcoin).  Regulation is a sharply polarizing topic in the community and is sill playing out.
You could say I'm looking at the topic of Bitcoin sustainability from a positive bias since I work at BitPay and have a vested interest in it working out long-term.  I like my job. ;)  But I really do, as an individual, believe it will succeed and be a sustainable digital currency for the long term.  It's growing so rapidly and has a LOT of institutional investment behind the various companies making up our community.  We're close to or just past 40,000 merchants that use our Bitcoin payment gateway alone for payment processing and performing a very, very large transactional volume.  When I look at the constantly growing transaction numbers that various Bitcoin companies are doing, I don't see how it's just going to collapse or fail.  There are too many upsides and momentum behind Bitcoin, in my view.
I would add or include how payment processing companies, like BitPay, lower the barrier of entry for businesses accepting Bitcoin as a payment method.  That factor improves the Bitcoin market as a whole because the more businesses accept BTC, more people will use it.  Cue snowball.
* Let me point out that these are my own personal opinions and do not represent the views of my employer.  I like Bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2014-04-08 18:27:39
Rich from BitPay here.  I'm the ecommerce plugins &amp; PHP developer and I'd invite you to take a look at our offerings.  We've worked really hard to make it really easy for you to handle Bitcoin payments on your site.  Currently, we have code libraries for PHP, Python, Ruby, node.js, Java, C# and Perl if you prefer to roll your own cart integration.  If that's not your thing, we have 14 different plugins for Magento, WooCommerce, Wordpress eCommerce, etc...  Best part is, all of this code is 100% open source!  Our GitHub repo is located at 
I can't speak to the merchant signup process since that's not the area I work in but I can tell you that our tools are great and constantly improving.  I've already worked with several of our merchants to dramatically improve our Magento plugin, just to name one example.
You can also reach me directly if you have any questions or suggestions related to our ecommerce code: rich
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:36:32
You are absolutely correct!  That's what we are hoping, as well.
@_date: 2015-05-29 17:59:28
If you do decide to go with us for your Bitcoin payment processing and run into any issues, feel free to drop me a line and I'll be happy to help!
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:40:57
Thanks!  I can definitely attest that the founders of our company (Tony and Stephen) are always looking at ways like this to give back to the Bitcoin community.  There are always so many cool things we're working on and this is the most exciting company I've ever worked for!  Now, if I could only get the remaining three engineering positions filled on my team...  ;)
@_date: 2015-05-29 17:53:28
Sorry to hear about that, Chubbybrownbear!  While I'm not on the compliance/onboarding team I can say that they work very diligently to get merchant accounts upgraded.  The process still requires manually handling certain documents to ensure all merchants are in line with our TOS and are legit businesses.  You also have to take into account the delay is actually locating &amp; sending the documents to us in the first place...  In any event, I'd write to support and let the very prompt Merchant Services team help identify what the hold-up's (if any) might be.
@_date: 2014-07-30 15:26:30
As the Dev Lead for our Ecommerce team here at BitPay, I can definitely tell you there certainly is constant development and maintenance.  Any time a shopping cart like WooCommerce updates their software and breaks our plugin, we've got to fix it.  Not to mention we're always improving our offerings and rolling out new features as the core team implements cool new things...
Speaking of, I'm looking to fill some development positions so hit me up via PM if you're PHP, Java or a Ruby dev. :)
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:49:23
As a business owner, do you want an additional revenue stream?  Then you'll want to take the time to integrate and accept BTC as a payment method.
