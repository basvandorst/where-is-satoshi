Jonathan from [Bitwage]( here. This is one of the reasons why being able to receive your wages in Bitcoin is valuable.  You actually don't need a bank account to obtain bitcoin if you receive your wages in bitcoin.  With Bitwage, we give you a bitcoin direct deposit account in the US, EU or UK, where you can have any percentage of your wage converted into Bitcoin. So instead of risking your banking relationships by buying directly on an exchange, you can just have a portion of your bitcoin sent to any wallet of your choosing every pay period, same to next day.
We've been around since 2014, have over 20,000 users and conducted over $30m in transactions. Feel free to send our team a message if you have any questions on our [slack]( or [telegram]( group.

Hi Elum,
Jonathan from Bitwage here. You can actually replace paypal entirely with our platform.  You sign up and receive bank account details (US = Account &amp; Routing  EU = IBAN  etc...). You provide these details to your clients and choose whatever wallet you would like your BTC to be deposited into.
Nice and simple. 
We have been in the industry since 2014 and work with many of the crypto companies you have heard of as well as service employees and freelancers from companies of all shapes and sizes.

Jonathan from [Bitwage]( here. Thanks for your interest in Bitwage. Let us know if you have any specific questions that we can help you answer. Besides responding here, you can reach us at [support or head to our [slack channel](  
*Do you provide BitWage an xpub public key to your wallet so they can pre-determine your next wallet address?*
You can provide us with a single address or a list of addresses. With the list, each address is considered a one-time use.
*Do they immediately forward money or is there a standard delay period like when withdrawing fiat from an exchange to a bank account?*
After we receive the funds, we process &amp; fulfill the transactions next day. Premium users receive the funds same day if the funds are received by 9am PST.

It does matter. All the funds received into the account must be for services rendered to a company.  You can perform services on a 1099 basis or a W2 basis.
Also, you will need to add each employer or client to our system. For an employer, you will be creating direct deposit information that will be fine for the entire duration of your relationship with that employer.
For a client, you will be creating an invoice on our system for each invoice sent out. Doing these things will ensure that we can fulfill the payrolls as fast as possible.

Hi, jonathan from [bitwage]( here. Not sure how you are performing your recurring BTC purchases, but Bitwage allows anyone to receive any percentage of their wage in Bitcoin from any employer.  Could help make that process easier and faster :)
