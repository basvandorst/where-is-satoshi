Give it a couple weeks if not months, ofc they can't acclimate instantaneously to the migration that's happening but they will.

Less than 1GHs for sure.

Those are the very people who created the bubble in the first place, speculators 100% created the bubble, people who aren't here with the mindset of the whole Bitcoin adventure.

Damn why is there such a big difference between MTgox and BTCe...
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:53:14
's going popular? BTC now 130USD on [mtgox](

It's too bad they don't show times on their 24H graph...

Other coins' values probably make it worse. :(
But their value may change.

I believe he was talking about a single GPU.

When they guy made the post about investing 30K USD when it was 25USD, on mtgox it was 90USD and now a couple days later after that post reached the front page it's at 130. Of course popularity affected its pricing.

Reddit's big enough for the impact to be bigger than a local news outlet's but that's my opinion.

Yeah that's pretty bad. 620s are not even shown on the mining hardware comparison wiki page.

3MHs wow I get 300MHs from a 5870... I doubt your new 280x will do any better, if you want to mine you're better off with an asic miner.
Forget about about videocard mining imo I calculated that at current difficulty with my card and the averaged reward per hour I was getting from Slush's pool it would take me 9 years for my next bitcoin.
I began farming late 2011 early 2012, my first took me maybe 1month and so did my second but when btc blew into mainstream it jumped to 3months and I haven't checked on that but the global pool's hash rates have gone through the roof since then and so has difficulty which means that right now, farming with a videocard is a waste of money. At this level, I think that Prime95 would be more rewarding to farm than btc with a videocard but I don't know if they offer that possibility yet.

Fix the DDOS fix the bitcoin economy, also dodging the market by going offline only when value drops is not really doing free market right. But that's just my 2 cents.

We're past half point. Blocks' value has been halved...

Because you didn't provide the DNA identification *sample*.
