I started a project that should handle any / all cases for taxable events and cryptocurrencies such as mining income. We're launching in late Feb and have a waiting list a la robinhood to build a userbase ahead of then.
Love to send you an early version of it when its ready to get your feedback. [Here's the link:

You may be able to use us in time! When are your taxes due in Australia? I was trying to read about it [here]( but I was pretty confused. Is it March 31 or May 15?

As I've written elsewhere: it is true and a very painful point of ambiguity for digital currency market participants. Its about the distinction of whether or not you are treating your crypto as "an investment" or "for personal use". If you trade your crypto **directly** for payment of services (i.e. I give you my BTC, you give me a coffee, car or massage) it applies. 
BUT you could definitely sell your digital currency first for fiat or swap it for another digital currency before transferring it. This would mean that your OG currency was used for investment purposes and then the USD / 2nd currency was used for personal purposes.

If you are able to export a csv or Excel file of your activities, then we can still help you with that exchange.

Hahaha fair enough! Cheers!
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:07:14
I didn't either! It was only during our research phase that I even came across this. IMO, platforms like Coinbase or Mist should warn Americans sending large sums to other addresses to help spread awareness.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:17:13
Unless your coins were sold for USD at the exact price received, you would have to pay any taxes on gains (or have tax losses on losses). Even in that scenario, receiving the coins in exchange for your mining services is *income tax*.

Thank you for your question!
Our tax preparation software will be launching in several weeks. If you *definitely* will be using tax preparation software this tax season, we recommend pre-ordering our annual license for 30% off (pre-launch promotion only). You can access pre-payment by signing up for early access on our home page at  
Our software will calculate your cost basis for your trades, calculate any taxable gains or income resulting from your digital currency activities, and will give you exports such as a TurboTax file, or PDF form exports like a Form 8949 or Schedule D for you to use for filing.
If you are a customer, we can also refer you to our trusted network of CPAs to help you file your taxes and get the most of your digital currency taxes.

Stolen, damaged or lost property is typically deductible as a loss, but you should consult a tax professional for your specific case.

I wouldn't know first-hand. I am not a Gemini user, but here's at least 3 reddit threads from people who got one from Gemini. I don't have any official proof from a Gemini source that they sent one, but included it to be safe. If I'm incorrect I can always remove mention of it.

Fair. Our product is still in development for this precise reason. We want to make sure that we are allowing for the different reasonable treatments that are available. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:24:15
Yeah exactly. It goes against the whole idea. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:32:03
We feel the same way about the taxes... doing what we can to provide confidence and certainty where they are... and everything else we can to help inform the government how they can and should be treated. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:04:07
They're treated in separate tax years, so first you need to pay taxes on your gains. 
Then in 2018, if you're super negative, you can apply them to your current and any future capital gains. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:47:43
Coins gained from hard forks are income at the time of receipt. You don't pay capital gains on that, but it is income (and taxable). Your cost basis is set to the value at time of receipt. 
Gains / losses are calculated based on the proceeds and value of the coin when it was received.

You're supposed to include as many Form 8949s as are needed. The form has 14 rows for each Short-term and long-term gains. If you have 150 distinct sale events, you will need 11 8949 Forms. [Highly recommend signing up for our tax preparation software]( as it will help you with exactly this case.

Our legal team would not appreciate it if we removed the disclaimer. 
Full Disclosure: We do have extensive legal and tax counsel, but at the time of writing we don't have any full-time CPAs in-house. However, we've just received funding so may pick up some in-house counsel from our network of collaborators and beyond.

That's currently a big problem with digital currencies at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:55:43
Depends on whether or not they are an employee or contractor. Any compensation should be reported as normally required. Payment in coins should be translated to fiat currency at the time of payment. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:32:24
Yes. API with all the major exchanges.
The best way to explain the difference in our product vs. any others is the following: We created our product because we felt that other solutions left so much ambiguity and uncertainty. As a result, we've built a product (launching in a few weeks) that is a step-by-step process and gently walks users through so they can build confidence, certainty and understanding of the tax decisions they are making. In addition, we've been working with an extended network of CPAs and lawyers to ensure that our product fulfills their "dream features." In short: our product is probably the easiest to use and most comprehensive.  
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:12:26
Technically, yes. Even if it was for a minute. 
Also would apply if you held $5,000 on Bitfinex and $5,000 on Binance at the same time (its $10,000 total on foreign accounts / exchanges).

There are multiple approaches to the subject. If you have the pricing information available by the minute you could use that. Alternatively you could use an average of the high and low prices, but I would recommend consulting a professional.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:12:23
This is a bit up in the air actually.
Everyone I've talked to feels pretty comfortable on this one.  "Wash Sale Rules" are a very specific rule that explicitly states that it applies to stocks and securities. Digital currencies are explicitly not a stock or security. Therefore, Wash Sale Rules do not apply to digital currencies. **However**, there is still the Economic Substance Doctrine which must be adhered to. This basically states that any trade must serve an economic purpose (and not solely for tax purposes such as generating a realized loss). That said, if you sold ETH and bought ETH 5 minutes later at even a 2% different price, you could easily argue that the trade had 'economic substance.' 
You can read more on this on [this IRS PDF which includes some examples.](

Mostly to share updates on the topic Dussander and many others have raised. Our mission is to help build confidence and certainty around digital currency.  Feel free to do whatever you like. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:22:29
So there's two events. 
(1) "income" received for the hard fork. You can pay taxes on this, but they aren't "capital gains" taxes.
(2) Then you sell the coin. You recognize a gain equal to the difference between the price sold and the price when you received it. You will have to pay capital gains taxes on that amount. 
I cannot speak to Bitcoin.tax software, but I know that our software will make it abundantly clear how it is being treated and why. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:53:06
Your gross sales should match your 1099-K exactly. 
Please [read the article we wrote on the subject as it addresses 99% of your questions.](
The reason why you may have 1000 transactions vs. 100 is because you placed limit orders that were fulfilled in smaller trades. For the purpose of your 1099-K this would be considered a single transaction.
Your schedule D should report your taxable income or gains.. which is NOT what the 1099-K reports. **Please consult a tax professional on this subject.**

@_date: 2018-02-08 15:16:27
Not necessarily! What exactly did you mean by the question?
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:47:55
Why do you think it isn't recorded? Your holdings at any point in time are discernible with the right information and there's a robust price history available.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:36:06
Our service is different that this reddit thread. I thought we were talking about the latter. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:05:18
As I posted elsewhere:
There's different sources out there and it is an ever evolving ecosystem. 
We're going to try and distill all available information into our FBAR article which -- will still only be as accurate as we can for that snapshot of time -- and will update it as needed. I [recommend you subscribe to our newsletter]( to get our latest thoughts on this issue as we determine them. 
There is no explicit guidance on MANY of these issues... which is precisely the reason for Cointaxes existence. Our mission is to create confidence and certainty around digital currency which is why we do our best to get the latest information available from the full ecosystem, regulators, lawyers and tax professionals, so there is a centralized source of information on this subject.
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:42:10
You can provide additional information if they request it, but it technically doesn't matter across exchanges. (i.e. If using FIFO, your first BTC bought would apply, even if you bought BTC on the same exchange you are selling). I hope that answers your question.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:40:24
Really appreciate the clarification. I'm also not saying what my person opinion on the matter is (which is that it is ridiculous - a lot of tax treatments around digital currencies are).  Its the conservative approach though. 
For the millions of fake currencies you created.... as long as I never sell it (acknowledge its existence or even have access to it), then it might as well have never been gifted to me. 
In the case where you took your "free" BCH and sold it for $1,200... you've certainly accepted that gift. The question is whether you have ~$300 of income and $900 of gain or $1,200 of gain. There's no fixed answer on this, but our platform would currently treat it as the former.
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:22:33
Thanks for the shoutout. I posted a reply.

Are you a CPA? I don't understand your comment

You have to pay taxes on any gain on the BTC traded for the Altcoin. And you also have to pay taxes on any gain on an eventual sale of the Altcoin. 
There was a lot of confusion on this subject earlier regarding "Like-Kind Exchanges" our counsel widely agree that these rules do not apply and that all exchanges are taxable. I [recommend you subscribe to our newsletter]( because we will be covering this exact topic in a full article soon.

I'm actually on the board of a company launching a free to play game (and equally hate predatory practices of the bigger companies). That's ok. Feel free to wait.

Hey! Thanks for the shoutout Here's my best crack at this. Again, with the caveat that there is no explicit guidance on a lot of these issues. My answers are skewed to conservative responses and are the same treatment I would apply to my own personal tax filing. I know everyone loves my [disclaimer]( but for legal reasons, I need to include it. 
1) Yes. You do. On our platform, we do it by calculating the effective gain using the USD value of the "parent coin" (i.e. BTC, ETH, USDT) at the time of the transaction. 
2) Correct. FBAR is for reporting overseas holding. You will want to talk to a tax professional, though. It's ambiguous whether FBAR applies to on-chain holdings, but its nearly certain that it applies to holdings indirectly held for you on overseas exchanges like Bitstamp. We're going to be issuing an article on this subject soon, so considering [subscribing to our newsletter if you haven't yet.](
3) On Cointaxes, we will not treat transfers between exchanges or wallets as transactions.
4) That's correct. You need to hold for over 12 months to benefit from the long-term capital gains rate.

There's a really funny analogy. If you're a farmer... and your cow gives birth to a calf, you don't have to declare or pay taxes on the value of your baby cow. The debate is whether the forked currency should be treated as a "birthed" calf or if it should be received as income. In the calf scenario, you would still have to pay taxes on the sale of the cow (or BCH) with a cost basis of 0.

Exactly. You don't have to file one. The exchange files it with the IRS and gives you a copy. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:37:47
I'm not sure re: the specifics of your case so I would definitely talk to a tax professional and legal counsel too. 
If you ever earned digital currency as income, you would want to identify exactly the time and value of the currency when it was paid to you. This would likely be filed and treated as personal or business income for which you would have to pay taxes. Then, upon sale of said currency, you will have another taxable event. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:09:49
This says MAY because you don't have to file an FBAR unless you meet the requirements (&gt;$10,000 in total, even if for just 1 minute, held overseas in the prior calendar year). If you do meet the requirements, I believe you have to file. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:16:05
Lol... Need help with that?
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:54:45
Its above $600. Below / above $20,000 doesn't matter.
The IRS definitely knows... so do with that what you will, but don't avoid trying to pay taxes. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:17:33
Thank you for your question. We're currently focused on US tax, but we will be expanding globally.

You can do that. Likely though, ANY CPA you work with is going to use our software though or a competitive one. No tax preparation software makes the kind of guarantee you see with CPA-client relationships. How could we?

Okay. Take it how you want. I appreciate your concern. 
FYI - I am personally filing an FBAR after my accountant told me I would need to around Thanksgiving last year. It was only then that I even knew it was a thing. It's not related to taxes at all and a relatively straightforward form to fill out. No need to hire a professional for it. Our software doesn't help with FBAR anyway.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:46:34
Correct. Unfortunately not - we can't make our gains go away. This only applies to losses.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:53:28
Thank you very much! doing what I can!
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:09:04
FBAR is weird because there's the debate over what constitutes as a foreign bank account:
* Is a wallet a foreign account? No one knows.
* Is a Binance or Bitfinex a foreign account? Very likely and this is where we recommend people file "just in case."
You're right that none of this is "definite" as there's a difference between being court-tested and being "expected."
Frankly though, we aren't making anyone fill out anything. It's up to them or their tax professional what they want to fill out. We just make it as automated and easy as possible so IF they want to, they can do so easily.
Our goal is to reduce the burden on the cryptocurrency economy by making "just in case" compliance as painless to do as possible.
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:45:21
My fear is that LN is going to make things REAL messy. I'm keeping a close eye on it. It depends, but hopefully the transfer of goods here will not be interpreted as a taxable event for Bob because he never actually obtained "ownership" of the BTC he merely passed it onto someone else. 
Imagine if Bank of America wrote a check for $1M as a bonus to their CEO. Then you, as the intern, were asked to deliver the check to the CEO. You wouldn't have a taxable event of $1M of income during the time you carried the check.

In my opinion, it depends on what you mean by overkill. I assume you mean: Is it necessary or is it excessive?
Confidence and reliability have value, it just depends on your clients and how much they value those things. That is what determines whether they rather have an independent appraisal vs. pulling the data personally.  It's the same with everything else related to compliance, isn't it?

Yes. There's a 0% tax bracket which you might qualify for, but you will still need to report your trades.

USDT is NOT USD. It's called Tether and every time you sell USDT it becomes a separate, taxable event. 
Binance would likely be considered a foreign account and would require an FBAR / FATCA to be filed if thresholds are passed. 
The holdings value is based on the crypto assets (not just USD held overseas). Try uploading your Binance files to Cointaxes.com and see what your holdings are. If you crossed $10,000 in value, you may want to see what your actual max holdings were, which are a requirement for filing.

Are you a US citizen? If so, you'd file a Form 8949 for your trades along with your Form 1040.

You say lemming, I say not breaking the law. Not sure why you think that digitally transferring money online makes you think you can break the law... but you do you.

What about them?

I ran an incubator in NYC for start-ups.
Before that I used to work for Richard Branson. My job was to help his team of investment professionals find things for him to invest in as well as manage his portfolio of Virgin companies.

Probably should launch on Telegram...

The issue here is likely that you need to add the reciprocal deposits / withdrawals on the side of your wallets. If we see that, we can manually flag all deposits and withdrawals as transfers. Please contact me at chris and I can solve this issue for you now.

Here's what I said elsewhere: 
There are two things certain: death &amp; taxes... at least until energy becomes free and the AI / machines take over. Then there's no use for something like "money" or taxes.
I want to live in that tax-free world, too.
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:54:39
True. Swapping crypto-crypto still creates taxes though (I hope you knew that).

If I sell you my old iPhone and you give me 1 BTC for it. You've realized a gain or loss on your BTC and may owe taxes on it. 
In theory, if I somehow sold my old iPhone for more than I paid for it, i'd have to report that in taxes, too.  That never happens though.
