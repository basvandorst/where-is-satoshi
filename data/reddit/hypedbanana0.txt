7.51% of the addresses hold between 0.1 and 1 BTC.
So the people holding 0.21 BTC would fall into that category and be in the top 10.31%.
Remember that we talk in terms of number of addresses and that people could have many different addresses.

I didn't imagine Bitcoin having that voice...
Cryptocurrencies surprise me everyday

Alright, I may have given arguments on a slightly different subject but still.
The BTC total amount is always increasing and -spoiler alert- will never reach exactly 21 million. You would still have to use a calculator until it reaches 21 mil (or 100 in your case) but because it never will, you'll always have to use one
AND EVEN IF WE IGNORED ALL THAT, we are talking about a digital currency. What the hell. This ""calculation"" (it's a simple, yet effective operation calle division) could be done automatically by exchanges or wallets or whatever. It's literally one line of code at max.

No it's a scam.First, you have to put 0.015 BTC to withdraw... I'm not falling for that. Then, no mean of identification is needed, so basically, even if it was legit, you could make plenty of accounts with temporary email addresses and, without playing, having BTC. Then, I played with the provided balance, on several accounts and won once but nothing showed up.

I would've put a QR code with my BTC address tbh /s

Maybe we should stop saying "buy some BTC", bc that implies whole BTCs, I don't know what we could say. I don't think "Satoshi" or "mBTC" is good for the average person
@_date: 2019-08-28 01:27:33
So it's not completely off. That might change
@_date: 2019-08-04 12:42:05
Woha ! What a nice move.

Is that a poor mix of an Apple branding and Google logo ?
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:33:58
Can you explain why  ?
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:58:00
That was sarcastic, I'll precise it
@_date: 2019-08-27 21:26:30
I know it doesn't answer the question, but I really love the actual name. It couldn't be simpler or general
@_date: 2019-08-07 23:25:45
Maybe someone can tip me so that I see lol

Actually, anon predicts a BTC dominance of \~ 40% so maybe don't fuck the altcoins too hard
@_date: 2019-10-13 19:35:12
That has no evidence, purely faith. Faith has no place in a rigorous analysis. Please provide evidence to back up your opinion.
@_date: 2019-08-27 21:35:52
C'mon. If you have a fixed denominator, for everyone and everytime, why not make it be 1 ? OH WAIT, THAT'S HOW IT WORKS. If I say "Hello I have  x BTC" or "Hello I have x BTC over 21 million, that makes y %" It doesn't change anything
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:32:42
That prediction is for oct 2020 isn't it  ?
@_date: 2019-08-08 23:44:17
Maybe your brain will force yourself to remember it if you don't have any backup
@_date: 2019-08-10 15:29:43
And so why aren't you into crypto anymore ? You may not have the funds *now* but why did you get out ? Would you get back into it if you had the means ?
@_date: 2019-08-09 15:17:21
These \^
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:52:23
No because that would make you own Bitcoin that is not created yet. Plus, nobody could enter the market, as 100% of BTC is distributed amongst people. I thought it was clever for a fraction of a second though.
@_date: 2019-08-27 21:13:55
Yes, we can still get usd for the exact reason that we don't talk in percentages.
If we did and if I owned 0.02% of the total market cap. The remaining 99.98% are somehow owned by someone. Money isn't like floating everywhere.  Let's say the market cap (MC) is 1 million and I own 200 000 then there are two possibilities :
1. Either my percentage doesn't change. If the MC goes up to 2 million, I now have 400 000 usd. The remaining 99.98% are somehow *already* shared between people, and each one of those people sees no change to the percentage they own, so they would now share all the 2 million and so nobody can enter this market.
2. Or my percentage does change, and my 200 000 stay the same, I now have 0.01% of the MC. That is exactly how it works now. Because that would allow other people to come in
