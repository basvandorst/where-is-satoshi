Gates and buffet are concerned about their pile of green papers ��

Ha.  Good one.  Better than nothing at all.  No good :(

I can withdrawal to my usd wallet.  But eth/ltc/btc are “transaction can not be completed”.  :/
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:28:46
The limit is a lot lower.  6k for me per week.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:09:27
I didn’t suggest to store on the exchange.  But Coinbase is the safest to buy it ... again in my opinion.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:46:30
It’s not their fault...they made the effort to communicate with you.  Given how large Krakens operation is, they can’t prioritize you because you accidentally messed up.   
All I’m trying to say is don’t be so quick to immediately defamed them.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:42:16
Yes.  Coinbase, in my opinion, is the safest exchange.  To avoid any bumps on withdrawals and deposits you should.  Otherwise I wouldn’t even use Coinbase.  
Edit:  it’s their job to comply with AML (anti money laundering) laws.  So without proper kyc, they can shut your account down.

How about betting $40k?  That’s more fun. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:52:24
Word.   Hope that would happen after I converted back when btc recovers ��
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:24:45
Np.   I’ll warn ya.  Transfer might take a week if you’re transferring via linking your bank account.  Gdax has instructions for same day.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:19:32
Ok!  Phew I thought I was just me.   I submitted a ticket for this.  Hopefully it’s fixed soon.  Pretty frustrating since i couldn’t sent out ether :/ 
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:46:08
I would convert all my ltc to btc and hold ��

I think it’s wise to be curious and try it.  But please don’t invest all your savings.  W.e the amount, be mentality prepare to lose as much as 50%-60% of it.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:44:18
If people speculate that USD will depreciate or w.e they can move their funds into btc.  This causes demand to go up and price will go up as well.  Just a simple scenario example.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:55:58
Never too late in my opinion.  You don’t have to hold “1”.   0.25 is just as good.  Cumulate over time.   
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:05:13
I’m not sure how true this is.  But when i enabled gdax my limit went to 25k for Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:55:35
It’s back and functional!

Damn sorry you’re getting some unhelpful comments.  But here’s my take... there’s a lot of factors. To consider... negative news like India not acknowledging as something with monetary value.  You got early buyers taking profit and you got sellers panic selling.  It’s literally a chain effect.   Until all the profit takers and weak hands are gone, I think we’ll keep going down. (Trigger some stop orders too along the way). There’s going to be a price that the whales and people with big pockets are waiting for, and once that hits, we’ll see some green.  This is just my take.  Be mentally prepare for more drops.  But long term, I’m still very optimistic that we’ll hit a new ath.

What?  It’s legal in Canada.  Prob one of the most bitcoin friendly country.  Someone correct me if I’m wrong xD
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:53:10
Ok my bad.  That was rude of me.  Made the edits.  I was referring to certain one sentence comments that didn’t provide the op any thoughtful comments.  
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:54:00
Estimated 11/16.
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:49:02
It’s pretty high right now for you to buy since the b2x fork is coming everyone’s loading up.  Better yet...buy now on Coinbase and hold for the fork.   
Edit: 
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:47:23
Lmao.  I’ll let my gf know.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:33:13
Trading between coins and USD via gdax with limit orders will avoid fees.   However, withdrawing from your Coinbase account still incurs fees.

Dipping powers?  ��
