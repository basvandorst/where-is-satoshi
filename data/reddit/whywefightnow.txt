scratch cards are not the same like private keys. 
you can validate cards (redeemed or not) with the security code.

"Q: When did you find out that the bitcoins were gone, and how did you feel about it?
A: A few days before we filed for bankruptcy. And we learned as we checked our storage when repairing the system to deal with malleability attacks. I always worried about ‘What if all the bitcoins were gone?’ Since that actually happened, I have gone through many sleepless nights. Scared, frustrated and angry—-so many emotions were occupying my mind."

sry guys but i think you dont understand how scratch cards works, they are no wallets. but wallet cards are also available. it seems you need to understand scratch cards first :)

well this might be true BUT if you know about an issue for looooong time and even document it you have to do two things: working on a fix (or get someone working on it) and/or watch it very close. i cant leave my front door open for a long time and as soon somebody steals my stuff tell others: ohhh the problem was the insecurance of my house, it was a doorability atack... WHAT A SURPRISE!!! thats stupid.
