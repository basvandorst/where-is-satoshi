Okay , I think I'm understanding . I have a different scenario then ; so let say I bought back in august and I used that bitcoin to buy stuff online , games or whatever , that's something completely different right ?  
Second- I bought LTC and ETH ( same time period, exchanged them for bitcoin and bought stuff online. 
I'm guessing this doesn't fall in reporting taxes ?

And if I understand this I report the gain , but what if I sold at a loss I don't correct ?

At this rate by the end of today

I predict about tree fiddy ! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:56:33
Do we have to declare value only when we sell ? New to this sort of things . 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:13:05
And a lung ! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:36:34
Will it even dump and pump ?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:47
I'm less speech for words 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:51:33
Do I have to write that down on my taxes every year or only when I cash out ? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:19:39
What fuck actual the !
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:40:23
Yea I’ve been eye balling since $98 and regret not buying some , just like lite coin when it was the same price . I see ripple might be worth checking out

I just looked into that , like I said I have a long way to go and already seeing that I'm technically "not too late" , since it's still early , it's a new market, So I'm told . This is definitely a long term investment and I don't mind it . No ones rich over night . Again thanks for the advice ! 
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:26:32
I just got Coinbase to see the rise and fall of all three BTC ETH and LTC, and I was thinking of buying a little of each. What do you think of pushing LTC and wait till it rises and from the profits I buy BTC , while still purchasing some BTC keep the money in rotation . Not sure if that would be an ideal strat.

Is it too late for a young whippersnapper like me to join ? 
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:56:49
Sir take me on this journey on how to watch the money pile up ? Or atleast point me in the right direction.
@_date: 2017-08-31 02:05:11
And that would be ? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:27:29
Got it , thanks , going in passionately to understand all this , I feel like its very beneficial to be in , I'll stick to your strategy, I was planing about 50 every two weeks . 
@_date: 2017-08-31 03:50:13
I would give you Gold but I'm broke right now ! Had to verify this, and you weren't kidding ! 
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:33:24
It really be like that though 
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:33:19
TIL : to Run my Malware and Spyware and Anti- Virus before transferring anything . 
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:38:04
Having the mobile Coinbase I assume that I'm also out of luck with getting any forked coins ? 
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:33:23
Since I'm still new to this, I thought Coinbase charges like  percentage depending how much you buy and the same to take them out , so sending out my BTC from Coinbase shouldn't be that expensive right ? 
@_date: 2017-09-07 22:14:09
Thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:14:27
Damb , I'm a whole day late :'( 
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:48:06
That would be a roller coaster experience! 
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:04:49
Got it , I was wondering why there was a fee to transfer out . Kinda felt like they were trying to get money out of me anyway they can, but I understand now thanks for all the clarification! 
@_date: 2017-09-24 02:45:09
Dogecoin. Don't forget Dogecoin . 
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:08:10
So did the guy sell before it dipped ? 
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:42:27
Ditto, every time I invest it Drops , then I invest more then, you guess it , rises 1% then drops even more . 
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:09:59
Yea . Good thing I just sent a very small amount to test it out but even then when I want to send 10 usd worth back to my wallet they are charging 3 ?! Insane ! 
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:20:51
Haha , duh , man idk what I'm thinking . I'll just transfer and take the Loss . Thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:19:36
Risky click of the day ! 
@_date: 2017-09-09 05:00:32
Ginormous if true.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:30:37
That's usually the case.
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:22:39
RemindMe! 1 year

So if it rises "we're running with the bulls" and if it falls we are "wrestling with the bears ?" I like it ! 
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:29:42
Yea I'm new to this game , just bought a little of the three main coins on Coinbase, still learning but feels good to be part of . 
@_date: 2017-09-07 22:25:18
Is it worth buying at such low quantities, for example 10 or even 5$ worth then move them to a wallet , because for me I feel like it's not worth spending all those fees on small transaction . I know it's dumb keeping them on the exchange but waiting till I hit maybe let's say 50$ worth then move it so I don't spend so much on fees. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:12:46
But why so high ? I send it from exchange to wallet and from wallet to other wallets and it's never that high. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:32:10
There's underground people.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:13:29
Hehe you said dump! 
@_date: 2017-09-28 06:48:48
Yea what HE said . 
@_date: 2017-10-15 06:09:11
Wanted to see how bitpay works and mostly interested in the Visa card you can load bitcoin to convert into fiat and use the card anywhere. Wanted to see how easy it is to get Amazon Giftcards but its abominable. Very high fees !
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:21:03
What was the deal with him ? 
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:46:47
You really aren't , except when you are . 
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:16:33
That's right . Yea o well , atleast it wasn't huge amount I sent over . I'll wait until the price increases to where I regain back the amount. Not a total loss.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:37:25
I tweeted at them and they chirped back fairly quickly.
