will a tiny, 'garage-style,' Japanese, company, that was set up to trade virtual playing cards, usher in a new age of digital money? Nope.
Someone who knows WTF they are doing will be taking over at some point... i imagine.

Saving (or hoarding, as you put it) is one of the functions of money.  
"As a free-market currency, it does what currency should do, which is increase in value over time."

I looked at your image.  I'm talking about the blue line.  The blue line is good.  
This is what i said:  I want bitcoin to quickly gain market cap in order to achieve stability.  This was in respose to Andy500 who claimed: 


I claim this is wrong, we need it to grow like the blue line before it will be stable.  Both the blue and yellow lines are volatile in the early stages.  Only the blue line eventually gains stability, by moving up the $$ axis on your chart.  However, the only way bitcoin gains any value at all is through adoption.  Thus, we need to adopt a volatile currency now, so that it's volatility decreases over time.  In other words, the exact opposite of what Andy500 said, that we want it to stop growing.
We need initial adopters who don't care about the stability.  This causes us to move along the blue line.  the more we move along it, the less tolerance to volatility a new potential adopter will need to have.  This is why i say it is not a chicken or egg question.
Incremental increases in adoption lead to incremental increases in market cap which lead to incremental increases in stability which lead back to further increases in adoption.  Along the blue line we travel.  The yellow line in your graph is also volatile because of low market-cap.  Make sense?  Sorry if my initial comments weren't clear enough.
EDIT:  To be more clear: the yellow line is volatile b/c the currency is subject to wild swings due to speculation.  The blue line becomes more and more resistant to speculative moves as its market cap gets higher.  Blue is volatile for a different reason, b/c the price is changing upward over time due to adoption.  As I pointed out, an upward trending volatility does not hinder adoption.  The wild swings both up and down in the yellow line means adopters assume a large risk of loss and thus are speculating.  Again, blue is good.

I feel the same way.  I STILL don't have a funded account set up 16 hrs later and now the price is $116.  That's like, ridiculous. LoL.  I see this a bullish, however.

This is very wrong.  The higher the value of bitcoin the less daily fluctuation will change its value (in % terms).  Bitcoins could lose $100 in value over 24 hrs, and it wouldnt matter much if each bitcoin is worth $10,000.  Also, if the flucations tend to be upward ... merchants will have no problem taking your bitcoins.  "Hey look, you paid $400 for a widget i was only charging $350 for ... better abandon bitcoin."  Derp.

You are playing number games here.  In your example ... I could just borrow the machine... create the 9 coins ... and then return the 'like new' machine to the lender.  That would be a zero percent loan and i would make 9 coins.  Obviously under normal circumstances we would split it.  The gains made from using the machine don't vanish.

Well this is true.  But the mining is pretty slow.  At most, bitcoins can only double over the next 100 years.  I would say the adoption of bitcoins has much more room for growth.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:36:22
Well, cause the lender would be better off just holding the money ... right?
@_date: 2013-04-23 03:35:53
I agree.  Increase the number of users.  What does this do to the price of each bitcoin given a stable supply?
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:18:59
but your 90 bitcoins would buy more now than the 100 did back then ... according to the premise ... esp if people are growing the economy with %0 loans ... no?
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:36:42
But if he didn't make the loan at all, he would have 10 bit coins a year from now, not 9.5 a year from now.  Which is always better regardless of the of how much more the bitcoins are worth.

It's not a question of "chicken or the egg."  We need marginal increments in use AND marginal increases in value, occurring simultaneously and perpetually. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:09:47
Here is why i think deflation is good:
1) Hoarding (aka saving). What is the point of Hoarding currency if you don't plan on eventually spending it. MAXIMUM Hoarding (for example) would have super rich men dying in the street with vast, untapped wealth - hidden beneath the cardboard-box they sleep in. Makes no sense. Can't happen. i.e. savings will reach equilibrium and the economy proceeds from there.
2) Prices, or I wont buy it cause it gets cheaper. Sure you could circle any flat-screen plasma in a catalog and decide to wait 18 months to buy it. It will be much cheaper. You could wait a decade and it will be almost free. But in the meantime, you have no TV. Choices must be made!
3) If you are gonna horde something you must first acquire it. Then, after you get some, you must consume less than you acquired. In other words, you earn income and then spend less than you earn. Imagine if everyone did that. No debt. Everyone has savings and thus a degree of Independence. No one living check-to-check in need of a bailout at the first sign of trouble. Less dependency. Ample unused production capacity and unconsumed resources to invest in capital goods production... How is any of this bad?

Of course there is a relationship between the value of something and what you can trade for it.  I don't see how that implies stability will only be achieved if bitcoin stops growing.


I want the value to be stable AND I want it to keep growing.  You imply that these are mutually exclusive.  I disagree.  The more it grows the more stable it becomes.
@_date: 2013-05-04 12:00:22
Fine. w/e, I think we have made our positions clear.  No need to keep it going.  good day, sir.

The main bitcoin exchange was designed for trading virtual playing cards amongst internet pre-teens (MtGOX = magic the gathering online exchange)... come back in a year if you need to see more before you buy.  Or take a chance and hope the infrastructure improves.  But, yes, you are right to point it out.

Slow but sustainable growth.... over time outpacing the total gains made with booms and busts.  Plus a lot less people get ripped-off/go-broke in the process. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 02:01:21
Although to make the graph more accurate, both lines would need to be "spiky" to represent speculative volatility with the "Spikiness" being similar in (absolute terms) at all price points, and thus the ratio of "spikiness"/price decreasing over time. The ratio of spikiness to price is volatility that concerns us, not smooth price increase that takes place over time. That is not volatility, at least as I am referring to it.

Well, think of it this way.  If you let the machine just sit there, it goes from 100 btc to 90 btc.  If you run the machine all year, you also get the extra 9 btc.  So clearly its better to use the machine.  Maybe the real answer is that the machine is overpriced and would have to sell for less than 99 btc or no one will buy it.
In other words, I think the question is designed to trick us somehow.
I am just gonna assume that if an activity is productive, it will be profitable, regardless of any inflation/deflation.  But I haven't got my head fully around it yet.
