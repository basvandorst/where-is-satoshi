Question for everyone. How long have the fees on BTC been this high and the delays so long? I have been buying and selling coins for a few years, most I have ever had to wait is 2hrs for a transaction to be confirmed. Last transaction I made before yesterday was about a month ago.
Am currently waiting over 24 hours for a confirmation and paid 230s/byte as a fee which I thought would be quite high.  I know it will come through eventually but things seem a bit screwed at the moment.

Thanks for the info. I had read about segwit on Bitcoin and hoping it happens soon. I guess there will be not be risk of a BTC-BCH type fork on the cards with this.
Looks like I need to do yet more bitcoin reading and research to catch up on what I’ve missed in the last month.

That's an unrecognized loss for 'FP'. When they come to convert to $ to pay staff and overheads is the problem point :)

Ok so there's obviously a moral issue with tax evasion but I was just interested in the mechanics of using Bitcoin to do it. Sooner or later someone will develop a variation on the above that is watertight and that will have implications for the Bitcoin project.
Not sure i agree with the crayon analogy - with the above you'd have transfers in and out of real cash at specific times to a market with a known price. Fake invoices by themselves would get discovered very quickly in an audit.

This is reference to a capital gain as per any FX trader - taxable profits are calculated at realisation. If you're paid for services in BTC you need to pay the income taxes applicable at a conversion rate to GBP (this rule applies to any country/currency you'll work in). Follow the logic through - BTC is just a currency like any other. If you could use the non-local currency to avoid taxes everyone would be on the scam with Euros in the UK. Now I come to think of it - maybe the Might Boosh guys were on to something?
