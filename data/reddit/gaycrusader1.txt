Oh, what nonsense.  We, as a society, judge people and companies based on past deeds constantly.  Credit ratings, criminal histories, etc.  Paypal has a long and illustrious history of fucking people over, but for some reason you think we should give them the benefit of the doubt *this* time?  Why exactly?
Paypal is simply best avoided in every possible case.

Fair enough, perhaps Paypal will do the right thing here.  Paypal often seems to go out of their way to be douchebags, though, so it's hard to say
I'm actually not terribly pro bitcoin, although I bought a few several years back so I pop in here from time to time to see how things are going.
There was another guy responding in here who similarly to you seemed to be very pro-Paypal and hopped around to a lot of Paypal threads, hence my thought that perhaps Paypal's social media team was showing up to try to slant opinion.  :)

You are a very strange person.  Looking through your posting history, you have numerous posts over the past year where you seem to show up in threads simply to defend Paypal, or mention how Paypal is great and the only thing you use!  
It's like you hang out primarily in subreddits where people talk about payments, and your primary motivation for being there is to shill for Paypal.
It appears you're just some sort of social media flunky working for them, frankly.

It doesn't take much to feel clever when talking to you.


I think we're done here.

This is literally the dumbest thing I have seen someone say in weeks.  
Haha, "Other peoples experiences don't matter if you have to look it up!"  
Are you a five year old?  Surely no one can be this dumb?

This is hysterical.  You're another person who seems to be a Paypal social media flunky, showing up in Paypal related threads all over the place playing a seemingly disinterested apologist.

Ahh, now I see, you're just ignorant and don't know anything about Paypal.
There are tens of thousands of complaints online from businesses that have lost money, many more thousands of complaints from individuals, there are entire networks of websites devoted to showing off how corrupt and capricious Paypal can be when applying their "rules".
You should educate yourself before continuing to make yourself look foolish on a topic you clearly know absolutely nothing about.
