• Bitcoin is a protocol by which digital assets are traded.
• Mathematics guarantee security through cryptology.
• Operating through a public online ledger, Bitcoin transactions are completely transparent.
• Relying on no third party, the protocol is decentralized, unhindered by trust.
• Bitcoin miners offer a portion of their computers' operating power to process transactions.
• Like the internet, Bitcoin is a disruptive technology.

You dont need to do this stuff to be safe. Generating a bip0038 encrypted paper wallet offline is secure and cost me less than a dollar.

The price reflects investor speculation regarding the future value, as well, and the open endorsement by bitpay of the extremely unfavorable bitcoin regulations proposed by ben lawsky to the state of new york is really bad news for the future of btc.

this is good advice. help me?
Two things prevent me from effectively riding the waves:
Delay in receiving funds when i sell btc for usd via coinbase. 
1) Receive USD on account? I'm sure there's a way to receive the money immediately, like you do when trading btc for other cryptocurrencies, right? like keeping it on account? or do day traders just spend the money before they receive it?
2) find reliable btc news. yeah I can just wait for the price to drop and perceive that the price is falling fast and it's time to sell, but are there perhaps reliable news outlets that report on the news first, so i can act immediately?
halp me learn to ride the waves xD

Anyone see a btc price lower than $430? Because the current high of $666 is only a 55% increase over the low i observed.

Could it be that these people invested in bitcoin instead of x altcoin because bitcoin came first?

Bought an msi gs60 3k-097. two hiccups:
1) bitcoin discount came in at $3.10 because i missed the fine print that the discount doesn't apply when a free "gift" is included, and the laptop has an accessory bag.
2) can't pay with bitcoin if any of your items aren't held by newegg. 
I kept the gifts, the $3.10 discount, purchased the reseller items in a different order.

Could be wrong, but it sounds to me like there is indeed an advantage gained in moving first, as the sunk cost fallacy arises in your favor, if I've properly understood these comments in this chain.

You seem to imply that bitcoin enthusiasts are atheists. Why?

You can't pretend to not know that what you are saying is offensive and unwelcoming.

Nov 2013 btc piqued around $1200/btc, been oscillating downward ever since, which isn't unordinary given btc's history of exponential spikes and steady declines, increasing in value long-term.

The title is somewhat misleading as we can see by looking at "all time" that Sunday's move was the 2nd highest number of coins in a little over 3 years.
