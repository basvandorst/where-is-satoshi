Essentially you're right, but there are devils in the details. The dollar is backed by foreign oil reserves. How did they manage that particular feat? Via the U.S. Military Industrial Complex.
I suppose ultimately the Feds switched the dollar from the gold standard to the lead standard, with oil serving as an intermediate.
However, all of that only works as long as people are respect your ability to wage war competently. If they lose their fear and/or respect of you, and you can't intimidate them, then the jig is up.
Like with Russia right now. I can't think of anything more idiotic than making empty threats to that crowd. The Russians are being real polite about it all, but you can tell, they have ZERO respect or fear of the Feds. And this is how the Petro-dollar dies, because they're not going to do any more oil transactions in dollars anymore.
The most the Feds have tried to do is kill Putin (that's what MH17 was really about, an assassination gone wrong) and they FAILED at that too.
I mean, all of this is playing out in slow motion, but the clock is ticking on the dollar, it's just a matter of time now.

Yup, it's a very hard to tamper record of transactions, that's it. Tally sticks served the same purpose, they were used to keep Britain's economy going from 1100-1800, 700 years. For 700 years, no gold standard, just a storage room with a bunch of tally sticks in them. They were almost impossible to spoof too.
I think their tally stick "ledger" was centralized, all the tally sticks were stored at the Exchequer, so that's one of two improvements to the tally stick, 1.) It's all electronic, no wood fibers for authentication, replaced with crypto math and 2.) because it's all electronic, it's also all decentralized.
The 2nd one is actually what make gubmints go crazy - it's essentially borderless, wherever the Intarwebs are, so can bitcoin be too and it's very difficult for them to interdict a bitcoin. It's everywhere and it's nowhere.

In any case, only TigerDirect can actually solve your problem. All the rest of us in the peanut gallery can do is basically say "that sucks". So, that sucks.
A lot of mail order companies actually like doing international business with bitcoin as I understand it, because there's no risk that bitcoins will be charge-reversed because the buyer is a scammer. So you can do business with any random country and be assured that you're getting paid. Like Walter White said "money up front".

Lending money isn't bad, it's fractional reserve banking that is.
Bitcoin lending will work without needing to charge interest, because it's a deflationary currency. People are losing bitcoins all the time, and whenever that happens the rest go up in value. You'll lend a bitcoin out and get a bitcoin back and the interest earned will be the value of the bitcoin going up when you get repaid.

Well to be more fine grained (and remember this is all about risk and reward), you dump a whole fleet of phantom cars (naked short selling really starts to work at large scales, when you can swing much more than what's on the bidstack) onto the car market which eats up half the bidstack and depresses the price by 50%, and then you cover on those phantom cars and by the time you're done the price recovers only 25%.
So you sold 10000 phantom cars at $30000 = 300,000,000
And then the prices crashes (because of the massive volume) to $15000
And then you start buying them back, to make it simple, you bought them all back at $18750 = 187,500,000
300,000,000 - 187,500,000 = $132,500,000
1.) You never had to borrow the cars to begin with (which would have limited how many cars you could have shorted)
2.) Because of that, you could pretty much sell as many cars as you could, figure out how big the bidstack is, and then adjust accordingly
3.) The way math works, a 50% decline needs a 200% increase just to get back to where the price was.
4.) And if you do it quick enough so you don't have to worry about delivery
5.) Low Risk Profit!

I'd strongly urge you to make as much progress on your own. Like that guy said above, don't trust anyone.
That being said, first thing to establish for yourself is a wallet of your own. Then lock it with a long passphrase. Once you accomplish that, see if you can send some small amount from his wallet to yours. You will need his passphrase if he's done things right.
Once you've accomplished that, empty his wallet out to your wallet and then make several, and I mean several backups of your wallet to at least two different removable devices, like a thumbdrive. More are better. Buy a whole pack of them.
As far as the mining rigs go - you may need help. Most of them have a web interface, but none of them are designed to be non-technical-proof, ie. with a wrong click, it is very possible to brick some of them. But what you really need to find out from those rigs is what mining pools they're working for. Don't touch them otherwise and shut them right back down after writing down that information.
Once you have that, try to see if he left any passwords and account names for those mining pools. Then you want to withdraw everything to his wallet after logging into his mining pool account (he may have locked the outbound address) and then once they show up in his wallet, xfer to your wallet.
After all the mining pool accounts are drained, email the mining pool and let them know he is no longer in this realm and they should delete his accounts.
From that point on, you have your own wallet locked and backed up. Now if you want to convert it all to fiat, you'll need to either go to an exchange, preferably one that isn't MtGox or go to localbitcoins.com and arrange a meeting with a buyer.
Make sure he shows you the money before xferring the coins. If he insists on waiting on confirmations before handing over the money, that's a reasonable request. If he wants 6 confirms before handing over some relatively small amount, he's being an asshole. 1 or 2 is good enough.
Good luck, and I'd start talking to your relatives to see if you have a family geek somewhere.

That's how market makers make their money - off the bid/ask spread. The more volatile something is, the wider the spread has to be. I'm sure there's some rocket science formula someone's come up with that will tell you for X% vol, the spread needs to be at least Y% to offset risk.

It's not that it must increase, it will increase. It's baked into the rules of the game. Debt will be X% bigger, every month. It's just math. The Fed can tweak how big or small X% is, and temporarily they can make X even go negative, but not for long or people will stop playing because the game starts getting silly.
And it has to match GDP growth closely (especially if you're in the exponential part of the curve) or the math starts to blow up. At some point the clowns at the Fed will do something moderately or even slightly stupid and that'll be all the math needs to make the economy explode. Once things go exponential, it's only a matter of time.
I suppose one could think about resetting everything so that we're back in the linear part of the exponential curve (the 1+X approximation), but that would also entail the dollar losing its reserve status as well. And there aren't a lot of people who actually like the dollar as a reserve currency anymore. Or who actually like or respect the federal government in world trade.
And even then our grandkids or greatgrandkids would be right where we are, dealing with the farce that is interest and fractional reserve banking.
The really nice things about bitcoin loans, is because bitcoin is fundamentally a deflationary currency - you don't need to charge interest at all! People are (and have) lost the keys to bitcoins that will never get moved or spent and every time someone does that, the value of all the active ones get a little higher. You loan out bitcoins and get the same amount back, only they've gone up in value since. And that takes care of interest now and forever. It stays at zero and the whole thing is mostly linear with no surprise exponential buttsecks at the end of it all.
@_date: 2014-07-27 14:57:47
I suppose in theory, but in practice, no. You couldn't lend out bitcoins directly, you'd have to create some fiat currency that rested on top of bitcoin. Call it Metacoin, and it would be 1:1 convertible with bitcoin, except you would be able to mine an unlimited amount of them.
1.) You have to convince people that using Metacoin is better than using Bitcoin. How you do that without drugs and twirling something in front of people's eyes, I haven't a clue. I mean, Litecoin has about 1/10th the worth of Bitcoin and Dogecoin, well, lol. Whatever *coin you wanted to overlay on top of Bitcoin would have at least 1/100th the value of Bitcoin, just because Bitcoin was first and Litecoin was second. And it would most likely have 1/10th the value of Dogecoin.
2.) You have to discourage people from using Bitcoin at all. With gold, that was easy, it's heavy and soft and dents/damages easily. People really don't like to fool with the stuff unless it's absolutely necessary. Better to keep it in a vault where nobody's touching it and just use this paper ticket. With Bitcoin, that's NOT the case! You can store all the bitcoins you want, and they're light as the air and hard as a rock and they don't dent or damage.

To be a devil's advocate here.
If I were running things, I'd write the regs to make sure I got my cut of the taxes and then leave it at that. And I think you can do that with 1 page of single spaced words. 
If you're a merchant, you register a set of bitcoin addresses with us. All transactions must appear in that set. If you're an individual, none of this applies, only if you're a merchant operating within the boundaries of &lt;jurisdiction&gt;.
I think you could even automate most of the tax collecting too, if the merchant tells you what wallet to send the request to - periodically you send a payment request to the merchant's wallet for whatever % of tax you're collecting.
Boom. Done. Expand that to one page of details.
No point in trying to control the uncontrollable. No point in trying to get the whole world to register their sexual orientation and shoe size in yet another leaky gubmint database.

Yeah, that's what it sounds on paper, but most of the time shareholders are a pretty passive lot. Sometimes you'll get some of the bigger ones actually making waves, but by and large, they're limited to selling their shares if they don't like what's going on.
The CEO is often also part of the board. And he's usually the one with the most knowledge at that level about what's going on in the company. I've rarely ever seen board members with boots on the ground trying to get their own idea of what's going on. Usually only when the company is in real trouble, but otherwise they're happy to show up and play flappy bird on their phone as long as the numbers look good and take their cut for being on the board.

It's impossible to pay the debt off. It can be transferred from one person to another, but it can't ever be paid off. And due to the magic of compounding interest, it's always growing. Exponentially. Think of them as nightmare bitcoins. Bitcoin's evil twin.
If you're not in debt, that means several other people had to assume the debt you aren't taking on. It's why the whole system is geared to persuade you in as many ways as it can to take on debt. Doesn't matter what for, the system needs debtors.
It all sort of made sense when the economy was growing exponentially too, but it's not anymore. It also means that if economic growth lags just a little bit behind debt growth all kinds of bad things happen.
It's part of the reason why the banksters have lowered interest rates to almost zero, and why all these bubbles have been blown. Yield starvation, they're calling it.
Anyway, it's why when things get dicey those types of assets that don't represent someone else's liability get so desirable. It's why an experimental really young currency can go from $5 to $500. Yeah, it may not be backed by anything, but you don't have to worry about the ability of someone else making their monthly nut for it to stay viable either.

You might as well just ask him to hit his head with a hammer and draw parentheses on every surface he can see. LISP will make a programmer out of him sure, the same way that chopping a tree down with your bare hands will make you a man.
You really want a beginner to shoulder the burden of learning JSON-RPC on top of learning LISP, a language that has a very small, very boutique job market and audience attached to it?  Is there a JSON parser available for LISP now? Or are you really asking him to write his own? Do I really want to waste the time to go check? The answer is yes, but you have to download it separately, it's not part of Common LISP. So before he even begins, he has to deal with how to build and reference 3rd party code. And he hasn't even begun writing a line of his own yet.
What dialect of LISP? There's like a million and a half different dialects and every one has their True Believers that believe that their dialect is the One True LISP and all the others are infidels. Mosty of them have their own very special very nonstandard socket API, last time I checked. God forbid he picks a dialect that can't use the socket() API (which was written in C and meant to be used in C). You're asking him not only to write in LISP but a LISP dialect, that's even more splintery-er and boutiquey-er. And he'll have to port the network code every time he wants to change LISP dialects. Don't handwave this away either, asshole, we're talking about a beginner here.
And whatever you write in LISP, it'll be ignored by oh, 90% of the programming world, because they don't understand LISP, and everything else is written in C++ (or python).
But it's no use arguing with a True Believer, you'll just come up with another excuse why the world should switch to LISP so the Holy Utopia can begin.
@_date: 2014-07-28 00:12:23
MtGox had lots of depositors too. And they eventually blew up once they went fractional reserve. Are you channeling Mark Karpeles? Lots of people would like to know how they can get their bitcoins back :P
Bitcoin does make explicit the sort of musical chairs gamble of fractional reserve. All those little tricks would extend the run time of your fractional reserve bank, but without a way to tap some elastic supply during a crisis, you would eventually end up right back on the same bouncy ball, sipping the same stale coffee as Mark. You might be thinking that there's some sophisticated formula that you can use to calculate that run time, but I would counter that with "black swans".
Remember bitcoin is finite, there is no elastic supply to tap either. Bitcoin was DESIGNED to mimic gold. Whatever is true for gold, is also true for bitcoin for the most part. Except for the physical attributes anyway.
You need something else that's convertible to bitcoin, that can be created on demand. Bitcoin is like gold, you're looking to lend in something like dollars. You'll find like the idiots at the Fed, that when you lend gold out (and they love lending other people's gold out, ask Germany about that), it rarely ever gets paid back (also ask Germany how much gold they deposited, they got back).
Perhaps if you make an arrangement with a mining concern (like with gold), you can lend it out without creating an asset/liability mismatch. That's about the only way it would work.
But the whole idea of fractional reserve is to be irresponsible anyway. Why not just take bitcoin deposits and then disappear? Sounds like a much simpler and straightforward misuse of other people's money to me.

It's not that I couldn't get it to run, I did. What, you want me to stroke your ego? You're a leet miner, yes you are, yes you are. A leet miner. Who's my leet miner? You are.
The point I was trying to make wasn't that I was having problems, it's that the bar to use P2Pool is too damn high. Not everyone is as technical (although maybe you think they're unworthy then). And the official documentation should always work. I was trying to emulate a user that can comprehend and follow directions. Not everyone is going to be that persistent either. Money is time in the mining world.
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:15:08
P2Pool definitely needs more work. The "official" install directions don't work, at least on linux. "make run" does NOT work! Something isn't being copied to the .pkg directory that the main.py wants to import. No telling how many people just gave up right there and went back to their favorite mining pool. 
And bootstrapping a new Bitcoin core wallet these days, even with a torrented bootstrap.dat file is painfully slow. The bitcoin core could use some more work on startup time improvement as well, it takes FOREVER for it to verify blocks upon startup.
And the P2Pool only has anywhere from 300-400Th/s power as I'm watching it. Which means that payouts are going to be a lot slower and more unpredictable. Even BTCGuild which has fallen out of favor has 11000Th/s power the last time I checked. Miners like smooth predictable payouts.
There's a reason why most people just point their rigs at a mining pool.
I think that P2Pool needs to be brain dead simple to install (and it's nowhere near there yet) and the bitcoin core wallet needs performance improvements. Ideally, if you insist on sticking with python for p2pool, make sure that the tarball/gitpull contains its own python environment that has everything it already needs to run. Yeah, it's probably redundant, but if someone is *that* tight on disk space, they can prune the stock install themselves.
@_date: 2014-06-20 13:51:57
eenvoudig means secure?
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:47:28
Well the bitcoin core wallet is written mostly in C++. So you need to master C++. But don't start there first. Start with C. Get to the point where you feel comfortable with C. Then get Stroustrup's C++ book and try to keep your head from exploding from the pressure that book will generate.

In the medium term I think we'll find a veritable patchwork quilt of regulations regarding bitcoin, from fiefdom to fiefdom. Perhaps there might be standardized national regs after a while, but gubmint moves so slooooooooowly.

So, practice regulatory arbitrage. Whatever it is you want to do, it's legal somewhere.

Think of bitcoin like a huge infinite array of storage lockers that exists on the internet. If you have internet access, you can reach this hall of lockers. You hold the keys to several of them.
Inside each storage locker is either nothing - or some tally sticks. What are tally sticks? Look them up on Wikipedia.
As to what you own? You share ownership over this hall of storage lockers with everyone else who uses them, and you own your private keys, as long as you keep them private. And I suppose you own the tally sticks that are locked with the private keys too. The tally sticks are the relevant part that you're probably concerned about - those are what you use to buy your stuff with.

I suppose a board can act as a safety dump, if it's patently obvious the CEO is incompetent, they can get rid of him before he takes the whole corporation with him. Sometimes.

Customers were lazy and didn't withdraw their bitcoins from their MtGox accounts to their wallets.
MtGox became insolvent via theft because of gross technical incompetence and then later managerial incompetence. They first halted withdrawals and now looks like they're shutting down.
So, stupidity and laziness all around for everyone to get a heaping helping.
I did buy a lot of my coins from MtGox, but that was way way way back in 2012 way before any of this silliness started. And I withdrew every purchase into my own wallet, like you're supposed to. So none of this is really affecting me, except for the price drop.
I suspect that after MtGox finally dies, the price will start moving back up again, but perhaps not right away. In any case, welcome to the wacky world of bitcoins. It's different over here. Different in what way, I'll let others tell you.

And like gold, bitcoin loves chaos. Runs on chaos, grows on chaos. Remember the last wave up was kickstarted by the screwing of the citizens in Cyprus.

It'll take at least 10 years for the highway redneck patrol to even begin to understand bitcoin enough.

Nobody who swings in size ever dumps it all unless they're manipulating for someone else.
My guess is he would first divvy it up into so many different addresses that it would take a century of processing to track it all, and then he'd only sell a little bit at time.

We saw this pattern after the $250 spike. Initial decline, partial recover, flatline, subsequent decline (where we're at), flatline, another leg up.
As long as they're mismanaging the fiats, anything that's outside the system will always catch a bid.
My advice is to stand pat and maybe catch it at the bottom of this decline. Easier to say and do when you bought at $5 though.

They lost my respect when their management started blaming everyone else but themselves for this. And then all the other exchanges fixed their bugs in a timely manner and re-opened. Except for MtGox. So, their management is incompetent or worse and/or they have no technical talent, that's what I see from all of this.
I don't think they CAN fix their systems. Either that or they don't have the bitcoins to settle with people. Either way, it's bad bad bad, and if they survive, they're going to have a really hard time winning back trust.

I wouldn't go that far. But the whole arrangement between citizen and state will be renegotiated. The state will still be able to collect taxes, but it will have to rely more on sales tax to do it. They won't be able to jerk people around with frozen or stolen bank accounts like they've gotten used to. And the whole idea of capital controls will have to go, along with central banking.
Something tells me, that the renegotiations won't be smooth and that's they'll do their stupidest and most violent trying to hold on to what they think they're entitled to.

I was fortunate enough in my childhood to get some lessons in math on compound interest, and it always stuck with me that if you buy something on credit you end up paying multiples over what the thing is worth. But I was in the minority. Most people are never taught about compound interest at all. And that's on purpose too, I think.
One of the most revolutionary things I think you could do in this age, if there's something that would really fuck the banksters over in the long run, is teaching all children right now, about compound interest, how it's calculated and the total amount of money paid to buy something on credit.

You know those lotteries don't really pay you $1000000 USD cash, they give you an annuity that will pay you $1m over N years, where N = 30 or so. If you demand to get all the money up front, that $1m suddenly turns into $600k or $700k.
And then you have to pay taxes on that. So by the time it's all said and done you're probably looking at $500k of fiat, once everyone on Wall Street and Washington have gotten through with you.

What none of these 20th c. relics get is that bitcoin (like the internet) is fundamentally a global international phenomenon. You try to regulate it onerously in your jurisdiction, you're playing whack-a-mole, it'll just run somewhere else. Regulatory arbitrage.
Here's something I think they'll have a terrible time grasping, these relics. Unless you're able to get most major countries (like say, the G20) to regulate all exactly the same way, if you can only see within the boundaries of your little fiefdom, people will only comply with rules that they actually want to, or see a need for. Because otherwise, they'll just go outside your little box and do whatever the fuck they want.
I can tell you one thing about your silly rules - nobody wants to be tracked. They're all just a little bit tired of it, since Snowden.

It's a pain to setup, but that's not the real problem. The problem with p2pool is you need a minimum amount of hashing power before it becomes viable. Otherwise you'll just sit and spin for several days while it tries to find a share that's always 4 hours away.
You shouldn't be using a proportional pool anyway - google for pool hopping and see why it's bad. My own experience with deepbit is that the 24h yield from them is about 20% less than anywhere else.
But don't take my word for it - run with them for 24h, note the yield, run with another pool, note the yield, etc - and then go with whoever yields the most with your current setup.

Deflation has to do with credit and leverage. I would use the word deleveraging, and not deflation. And it's when everyone tries to delever all at once that causes the problems we see.
The BTC world is mostly cash-and-carry, very little credit or debt denominated in BTC (and the people that are into borrowing BTC tend to be that pirate guy we all know and love). So, no leverage, no deleveraging.
But at some point, people will get the bright idea to create levered BTC instruments, and that's when the problems will start.

If it's straight PPS, it doesn't matter how big or small it is. Big only matters if it's proportional or DGM, where the frequency of the payout is loosely proportional to total hashrate.
You shouldn't be contributing to a proportional pool anyway (google for "pool hopping") - DGM or PP(LN)S is Ok.
I like that 50btc lets you cash out manually, and it lets you cash out everything that's in your account, so you don't have some residue that's always in the pool. Their PPS rate is competitive, and their stale/invalid rate is fairly low.

Most supercomputers are just CPUs with vector processing. Actually most desktop CPUs have vector processing these days as well.
Neither really gets you anywhere - the magic behind the GPUs, is that they can't process a lot, but they can do a little processing in a massively parallel manner. And it's only the radeon cards that have this, the nvidia cards pretty much all suck at it.
Now if your friend has access to one of the GPGPU clusters that research places sometimes use for floating point calculations, yes, then it's time to see what sort of mining you might be able to do on it. I'd be discreet about it, and I'd deal everyone who discovers it in on it.

Ok, I'm not thinking Pixelon anymore. Sounds like his real mistakes were a.) pissing of the Feds and b.) traveling to a country semi-friendly to the U.S. that had an extradition treaty

And he's not the founder - or the majority stock holder. So again I'm not thinking Pixelon anymore.

Be nice if it was integrated into the official bitcoin wallet, where you could rate an address after the txn, and mark the rating as buyer or seller.

I think there's a minimum technical skill cap she has to reach. If she can a.) restore a wallet from backup, and b.) transfer bitcoins into MtGox, everything else from there is more or less filling in the blanks. At worst, she could call up MtGox and they could hold her hand from there to wherever.
The restoring a wallet could be made a LOT easier - for a power user it's not a big deal (copy this file to this place), but you have to know what file to copy and where. That process could definitely be automated, in fact I think it should be part of the install process - there should be an option to restore from backup while you're installing a new bitcoin wallet.
In any case, make sure you backup your wallet to a thumb drive regularly, if it's encrypted make sure she knows the passphrase and of course make sure she knows where the thumb drive is.
I could see a need for a program, that takes a backup wallet file, a bitcoin address that holds the bitcoins, a bitcoin address that's pointed to, say a MtGox account, and asks the user for a passphrase that the wallet is encrypted with. It has one button, called "send" that goes active once it's synced up with the current block from the blockchain and if the first bitcoin address is nonzero.
Put that program on a thumbdrive, preload this send program with the two bitcoin addresses along with the most recent wallet backup and some documentation that tells her what MtGox account to login to after hitting "send". Maybe put some docs on what to do once you're logged into MtGox, etc.

If your economy depends on central control, and from what I gather, Iran's economy is just as centrally planned as ours or China's - I don't think bitcoin would be welcomed officially.
But every repressive regime has a black market. And bitcoin just seems to be loved in every black market that finds out about it. So I suspect that in the Iranian black market, BTC has a future, if you can get internet access on the street in Tehran.

I dunno, the way shorting is done with stocks, is you borrow someone's shares and sell them on the open market. Then you buy them back later on and return the shares. You do know that short sellers are on the hook for the interest accrued while they've borrowed the stock as well as any dividend payments, right?
So, find someone willing to lend you X amount of bitcoins for Y% interest rate that you two have agreed on. You might need to pledge collateral, I don't know. It all depends on the lender. Then sell those coins on the open market and then wait for your position to do its thing. Then you buy them back and return the coins, plus whatever interest you agreed to.
Brokerages and exchanges like to hide a lot of this from you, but there's no reason you can't DIY. It's the bitcoin ethos, after all.

One thing they can't do with bitcoin is naked short it. In order to sell it, you have to buy it first.
It's very hard to cap price rises due to accumulation, which is punch  of the 1-2 punch they regularly give the gold/silver paper markets.
If you see someone attempting manipulation, watch for the same price spikes to show up at the same time, day after day after day.
I would expect that the first salvo with bitcoin won't be manipulation - they'll just start hassling the public exchanges with more or more selective regulatory enforcement, to get them to shut down.
They'll make getting state fiat into and out of the bitcoin world more and more difficult.

If you don't have physical security, you don't have any security at all. And if you're constantly around a lot of other poor smart people, well, not saying it's right, but I understand.
If someone could get physical access to your computer, they could install a rootkit or a keylogger and be gone in 5 minutes. Have you ever left your computer alone in the presence of other people for at least that amount of time?

If something becomes desirable enough, people are great at finding excuses to participate in it.
For example, in really religious households where losing your viginity before marriage and using birth control is more or less illegal, the girl will often engage in anal sex with her BF, because [technically]( she's still a virgin.
So, I suspect if bitcoins become desirable enough, someone will find some obscure part of whatever book it is you follow in your religion, and use that to make it OK to use bitcoins.

Expect this going forward, that more and more gubmints will start hassling the exchanges, that banks will cancel exchange accounts for no reason, etc.
I suspect the real exchanges that won't get hassled will be either P2P, where the site is just responsible for matching buyers and sellers and it's up to them to settle (probably with some sort of credit rating)
Or certain jurisdictions won't really care about bitcoin exchanges but most of the banks won't really let you xfer money to those places without giving you a lot of grief and hassle.

There are soooo many ways to hide data on soooo many different portable devices. And some of thise devices can be quite concealable. Just to detect that you have a backup of a bitcoin wallet would be quite a challenge. To PREVENT or interdict the transport of a bitcoin wallet - that would be almost impossible to do. And even if they have a copy of your bitcoin wallet - they have to make you give up your passphrase.
Compare that to detecting the presence of gold, transporting gold or getting access to your gold once they've detected it.

Nothing's stopping you, you know. You might have trouble finding an accountant, but I'm sure if you ask around, someone will take your tax situation on and do the bookkeeping.
And then you can cut the tax authorities a check and I'm sure they'll be completely indifferent to you.
But unless they suddenly get 100x smarter, there's no way they can prove which bitcoins are income, which ones are investment, who you got them from, who you're giving them to, etc. Even who owns what bitcoins is a bit beyond even the brightest in the bitcoin community. I mean if blockchain.info can't get it right, there's no hope for them. It isn't like any business is going to report a W-2 or a 1099 denominated in bitcoins.
So I guess it's up to all of you as to whether you volunteer that information to your government or not. I take it that's not good enough though for OP, you want everyone to involuntarily volunteer?

I gotta say, if the shoe was on the other foot and the government owed you money, they'd definitely want you to prove it first, and they'd diligently put obstacles in front of you before they'd hand over anything.
And with the government letting big criminals skate over the past 4 years now - why should you behave more ethically than them? You do know what they call you behind your back - a sucker. A cow to be milked, that's what they call you. 
So moove along Bessie. Moooooooo.

I would argue that bitcoin is rather slow. Txns clear every 10 minutes. For web stores, that's not a real problem, but for face-to-face retail, if you want to be even sort-of sure that you actually got the coins, you're going to have to wait for those confirmations that come every 10 minutes.


Not completely. They can DDOS the exchanges, they can shut down most of the routes of payment into the exchanges. Wouldn't surprise me if they start tightening up those gift cards too - buy a gift card and they're going to want your sexual orientation and the church you go to before giving you one.
What they can't do is require everyone to get licensed to trade bitcoins. They've been trying to shut down bittorrents for how long now? People are going to be trading bitcoins with each other, no matter what silly laws they claim to have.
I suspect in 20 years, there will be bitcoin exchanges, they will all be outside the US, and getting any sort of money to them from the US will be very difficult. However, it won't stop people from trading them on the black market, and it definitely won't stop people from trading them with each other inside the USSR, er, USA.
Makes me wonder what people used to trade with each other on black market in Soviet Union back in good old days of 20th century.

Deflation or inflation as long as it's slow enough, isn't really an issue. If rate is even moderately predictable, most markets can discount it.
I mean, people may complain about inflation (it's a regressive tax, more or less) but life goes on.
What makes deflation or inflation problems, is when they happen too fast. That tends to shut down trade in the economy until merchant and buyer can figure out how much to charge and what to pay.
A somewhat deflationary currency like bitcoin will encourage saving instead of consumption. But then again, shouldn't money mean something? Shouldn't you have to think a bit before you spend?
I dunno, maybe money should mean nothing and you should spend as much of it as you can. That thinking tends to lead to runaway hyperinflation.
None of that matters as much as bitcoin, like gold doesn't have a counterparty credit risk. There's no fractional reserve system to eventually collapse, when you own a bitcoin, you own it. It's completely outside the banking system, and as the intro video says, it's almost impossible to control it via customs or to freeze accounts.

I wonder if they have moles in the various linux distro maintainers though. Most of them are too small, but I wouldn't be surprised if a mole was found in Shuttleworth's group, slipping in back doors right before the source is compiled.
If you really really want to be sure, you're going to have to bootstrap GCC from your own C compiler that you built by hand (make sure you audited GCC first). Then with that GCC compiler, compile the linux kernel, and all the utilities it depends on, downloading the source, auditing it, compiling it.
Basically Linux From Scratch.

Oh jumpin' jesus on a pogostick. Have none of you seen a correction before? I wondered when it would correct, never in my wildest dreams did I ever think it would north of $250.
As far as BTC market manip - nah, they need leverage to really spin that illusion. So far this is not a levered up market - most who have bought has bought with cash. But I see they're working on that, trying to add margin to the bitcoin market.
In any case, get used to this level of volatility going forward. If it can move $10 a day, expect at least 4-5x that on a real correction.

Don't confuse time windows with risk. Day traders are speculators too, they just operate at the 15minute and shorter level.
A speculator is someone who is buying something because he thinks it will go up in price, or is shorting something because he think it will go down. That's it.
If you're buying bitcoins because you want to buy something on bitmit, or you are providing a product, you're not a speculator.

Everything cycles. Volatility too. You go from hi vol to low vol back to hi vol.
I've learned enough not to say which way the triangle or coil will break (google technical analysis coil), but break it will and soon. They usually (usually) break in the previous direction before the correction. But not always. I've seen some of them go down.
I'm very tentatively thinking it will break up, mainly because there's no obvious manipulation like with gold. But I'm not daytrading BTC, so I don't have much skin in the short time window game.

And the reason you're waiting for physical - is because the guy you ordered it from - does not have any in stock. Like with the mining hardware makers, what he's done is taken a preorder. The coin shop passed your order on up to the minter and he's praying that the minter finds a way to get some more physical so that they can fill your order and ship some coins to his shop to then turn around and ship to you.
What I find really interesting is that all throughout the "smash", ebay completed's for typical bullion coins has remained stuck at around $1500 or so and so far has refused to go below that for much.

All that would happen is the difficulty level shoots up. The system is designed to produce BTC in a predictable manner, which the markets have properly discounted. They're very good at front running things like this.

When traders go home for the night, they often put on what's known as a "stink bid" or a "stink ask", a standing order that's priced far away from where it's currently trading. The idea is if it moves, they get favorable exposure to the move if the order gets tripped.
Then when they get up and login to start their day, those orders get canceled and they start trading. I remember a futures floor trader telling me not to pay too much attention to the order book, just get a feel for the ticker, that's all you need.

Depends on how bad things get. The blockchain ledger would still exist in multiple states, I'm sure someone would've made a backup of it.
However, screwing with the blockchain ledger would get significantly easier. With a lot less mining nodes around, reaching that 51% of hashing power would be more feasible. If you still had internet. If you still had power.
But honestly, if WW3 happens and you somehow survive, I don't think the loss of your bitcoins will be your real problem. Finding things like food and shelter and clothing would be your real priority, and then if you somehow managed to get electricity flowing again, and jerry rigged an intarweb connection, then you'd be worried about recovering from backups (you did make backups, right) and seeing what's left of your BTC stash.
Even gold would be more or less useless in a Mad Max screnario for the most part.

Yes, it's arbitrary, but if everyone else is thinking of silver in terms of troy ounces, then you pretty much have to as well, or you'll always be translating back and forth between your measurements and everyone else's.
Most people still think in terms of whole coins, a few are doing micropayments, yes, but for the most part you think of thing relative to 1BTC.
And with silver you think of things relative to 1oz. There are some places where they think in terms of Kilos or Tolas, but at least in the Western world, it's all troy ounces.
So when 1BTC = 1oz, it does give you reason to pause and think, at least in the western world...

Also I might add that it's the cause of deflation that gets everyone's panties in a wad, and not the deflation itself (with some exceptions of course).
What generally sets off a deflation is a credit crunch, usually caused by a bubble and malinvestment. And like inflation, it's not so much the deflation itself that causes problems but the rate of change that does.
If it happens gradually, the general economy has time to adapt, plan and adjust to it - whether it's inflation or deflation. What really kills commerce though is a too rapid increase or decrease in the value of money. When the change in the value of money overwhelms the ability to set prices properly, then everyone just stops trading until they can figure it out.

At its heart, it's a distributed decentralized database that's used as a public ledger to record transactions. That's it. There's quite a bit of magic involved with making sure that everyone all over the intarwebs agrees on the exact contents of this public ledger. The key part to synchronizing everyone to the same ledger is built on top of crypto-grade hash functions.
The ledger contains transactions - people shifting numbers around to each other. Quantities of what? They're just numbers, like a video game score nothing more.
It uses public key cryptography to sign the transactions, but the technology to do that has been around since the mid-90s, I think. 
There's some more magic involved with adding new bitcoins to the network - anyone can print new bitcoins, but it happens in a controlled and predictable manner, and the total number that can be printed is finite with definite bounds both in quantity and time.
Anyone can join in - there's no central authority to ask you a bunch of questions before opening a bitcoin account, all you have to do to create an account in bitcoins is install a wallet or use a wallet that someone else has already installed.
Trading bitcoins for fiat is a bit tricky and not at all convenient. The governments don't like it when money slips out of their sight. Try to send fiat to MtGox sometime and see the hurdles you need to jump over to do it. 
It's not impossible to track and de-anonymize bitcoin transactions, but it's significantly harder to do so than with the traditional banking system. The ledger is public, but all it contains are random numbers disguised as bitcoin addresses. So there's no need to get a search warrant, everyone has a copy of the ledger. But the real problem is tracing who is behind these bitcoin addresses. It's possible to do it, but it's a hard problem and there aren't that many people who can do it. And most of the people who can do it, don't want to.

Ok, you're physically secure. So it's not that then. They had to do it remotely. I could try to theorize maybe you have a hacker landlord, but I think the probability of that is very very low.
Perhaps one of those bitcoin gambling sites used a 0-day exploit to install a keylogger and a rootkit? And the rootkit had a "search all attached drives for all wallet.dat files"? I'm not exactly an uberleet scriptkiddie, so not sure what features the typical rootkit has. 
I'd go through the list of every sketchy site you have visited recently.
Truecrypt doesn't really buy you much in the way of security while your computer is running. Once you've mounted the drives everything in those TC volumes is available for reading (and copying). TC is great, but the threat it's protecting you from are people who want to confiscate your computer when you're traveling through a DHS checkpoint or when the police get the address wrong and decide to confiscate and make a copy of all your data. Or maybe they get it right, but you still don't like them riffling through your shit.
You could try to figure out what rootkit was installed or what 0-day exploit they used. Maybe it's worth it, maybe not. In any case, I wouldn't be logging any more keystrokes on the thing than you have to, before you reformat everything and reinstall.
And I'd be more careful about the sites I visit in the future.

I think the designers' argument is that BTC is much more divisible and granular than traditional money is. So if it's always going up in value, eventually people will start thinking in terms of milliBTC and microBTC.
Psychologically, I personally think it will act as a brake on spending in general. The tendency will be to save in BTC and only part with it when you absolutely must, because again, it's always going up in value.
Which I suppose is bad if you're some big consumer retailer corp that depends on people spending all they have every month, but most of the entities that benefit from the current system are neither you nor me, so with no real stake in the outcome, I don't really care.

This. If they were going to stomp it via technology, they pretty much had to do so back in 2009/2010. Now it's getting too big.
There's two prongs left though. They can just outlaw and tax the shit out of it, or they can try to manipulate the exchanges.
I'm of the opinion that the bitcoin marketplace is not very leveraged, and you really do need a certain amount of leverage to work manipulation magic.
My bet's on regulation, they'll try taxing the shit out of bitcoin, and my guess it would start with outrageous penalties if you're caught moving bitcoins across national borders. And then they'd probably move to require every address be registered to a name or email and make receiving payments from unregistered addresses to be a serious crime.
If all addresses that mattered were registered, it would make tax collection easy - they'd just troll the blockchain and see what you made for the year and send you a bill. Big corporations would love that too, all your purchasing habits online for them to mine your ass for. Mine me baby, oh mine me.
I suspect that crossing between registered and unregistered would be tricky, but where there's a will, there's a way. And most people would prefer to do business with unregistered addresses.

They're just lost. Or, at least, those coins are unspendable, because if the private key is lost, until you have that private key, the network will reject your attempts to spend them.
I wouldn't be surprised if at some point in the future, as part of the bitcoin ecology, you find people who have collected all the "lost" addresses, addresses that haven't seen activity in decades, and doing their best to find the private keys to transfer those coins.
But back to how people will react to this? All the rest of the bitcoins becomes slightly more valuable over time. This kind of deflation is pretty slow, I'm claiming, and if the rate of change in the value of a currency is low, the rest of the markets are able to discount it properly, and life goes on.
The reason they decided to make it slowly deflationary, is that it is much more divisible than the typical currency. Although if say, a satoshi became valuable enough to say, buy a can of soup, then bitcoin's deflation would start having problems.

It's a theoretical number. You take the number of shares out there held by people, you multiply that by the last traded price and you get this thing called a "market cap".
It's more of an ego stroker than anything else. Companies use it to fap to when they release their quarterly reports, mainly if the market cap has gone up or is some huge number.
It's not real though. If you were to try to liquidate every single share of whatever, people would start bidding you lower and lower prices to buy and if they figured out you were selling EVERYTHING, they'd bid the absolutely lowest price they could, mainly because they sense blood in the water.

I've said it before, if bitcoin was a physical substance, it would be really dense but weigh almost nothing. But it would have all the inertia of a dense heavy object. You'd try to give a coin to someone and it would just hang in the air, moving slowly.
There will be people who will front the bitcoins eventually and take a cut for handling the risk. It's too bad something like this wasn't built into the system. If you want to know how centralization happens, this is it. It'll be too incovenient to access the bitcoin network directly, so people will build these meta-bitcoin networks.

They haven't stopped people from buying illegal drugs. They have made it harder to do so, and the price of the drugs reflects that.
I suppose anything centralized is vulnerable to attack. Probably in 5 years, if you're buying or selling bitcoins, it'll be p2p and not on a central exchange.
Either that or the exchanges will all be offshore and all the routes into them will be watched and guarded by the government.
But as long as the governments are printing money to stay afloat, as long as they're making their fiat more worthless, all the alternatives outside their system will always have a bid, and the trades will happen, one way or another.
If you really want to kill bitcoin, just stop printing money.

The US Dollar is backed by debt. A dollar in your hand represents someone else's liability. A promise of services and goods in the future. They're fairly light, but they can get bulky in any significant size. The fed is adding about $85b new dollars to the money supply ever month. There is no upper bound on the supply.
I suppose the Pentagon comes into the picture when someone outside the U.S. decides not to either service their debts or if someone decides to start doing business in something other than dollars. You could cynically connect the decision to conduct business in oil for euros by Hussein to the invasion of Iraq. Even so, there's only so much ass kicking the Pentagon can do before it starts being a net minus. Threats are more effective than the actual violence.
Gold isn't backed by anything at all. However, a gold coin in your hand isn't a promise made by someone else, it's a good, not a promise of a good. Gold is very heavy in any significant size. Mining companies add about 1-3% new supply every year at great effort and some risk. There's no definite upper bound on the supply, but unless we start mining gold on other planets the supply is finite, whatever that number is.
Bitcoin isn't backed by anything at all, and it isn't a promise made by someone else. It's very hard to counterfeit (unless the devs make another blockchain boner in the code) and it's as light as the hardware needed to store a secp256k1 private key. Miners add probably more than 3% a month to the supply but the total supply is finite with an asymptotic boundary.
If bitcoin was a gold coin, it would be light as a feather, but when you go to pull it out of your pocket and try to trade for other things, it gains about 1000x the inertia of a gold coin. You'd have to pull and push and pull and push while to get it out of your pocket and it would take some time to place it in your trading partner's hand. You'd both be sitting there while it hangs in mid air waiting for these things called "confirmations".

The whole scripting subsystem is way way WAY over-engineered IMHO. You can tell they don't really trust it much, because they only allow a handful of script types to actually be run. How much effort was spent writing all those unit tests to make sure the script interpreter is correct, and then guarding the gates to the interpreter and allowing only one or two script types to actually be run?
Having lots of rope is good, but too much rope and you run into the probability of hanging yourself.

I think all centralized entities will run into problems. They railroaded e-gold into the ground back in the '90s, because there was one central point of failure.
The real problem you pointed out - fiat &lt;-&gt; BTC can be solved without resorting to a central entity or even a bank.

Gold went from 197.5 to 100.0, a decline of almost 50%. In 1979, it went to 800 at the coinshop and 1000 on the futures. People were lined up outside to buy the stuff.

Lol, user group for the internet. You had user groups for PCs, you had user groups for BBS's. Teh intarwebs was mostly relegated to universities and technically oriented corporations. The most anyone had back in those days was USENET. No meetups, just your VT100 terminal and emacs and USENET. And people spent hours on the internet like that, talking to each other on 25x80 green on black.
Edit: And back in those days, it was the engineering and science students that knew and used the internet. The liberal arts people (where all the wimmins were at), not very many were on. A few of them got past the technical barriers, but the majority were going to wait for the WWW browsers on Windows PCs to arrive before venturing on the intarwebs.
The first WWW browser hadn't been invented yet, most windows PCs couldn't really talk TCP/IP yet, and when the first WWW browsers came, they all ran first on unix workstations, not PCs. All of that came years later.

You have several options, but not knowing which country you're in, I can't tell you which one is best for you. You can always cash out on the Silk Road, google for the details. However SR may not have the best exchange rates, but unless the mail gets seized (unlikely for something like a prepaid card) or the SR gets busted, you will always be able to trade your bitcoins for cash (as well as other things) there.
You can avoid cashing out altogether and just trade your BTC for things directly too.
Don't worry about the tax implications, if they can't track the income via some statement from some centralized authority, they can't really prove you have the income, unless you tell them about it.

I guess this goes to show that it's still very early days for bitcoin when the market infrastructure can't handle all the people. But one day it will be able to, it will.
And one last thing - slow gradual rises interspersed with short sharp corrections (and a crash is just a larger cousin of a correction) are textbook hallmarks of a bull market.

Oftentimes prices rise too far too fast and the thing being traded is considered to be overvalued. So when it falls nobody wants to buy it until it reaches a lower price. And when the price reaches some point, the logical value fundamental guys come out to quietly accumulate and another bull cycle begins.
But in the gold market, prices are set by state diktat more or less (when you have JPM owning more than 80% of the shorts and JPM is known more or less to be the prime agent of the Fed), and at these prices, people consider gold to be undervalued, so they rush forward to lock in the price. Also notice, they're no longer rushing forward to buy GLD or ZG01 or whatever the paper du jour is. They're buying the physical.

Don't join a proportional pool unless you plan on pool hopping. If you don't know what pool hopping is, don't join a proportional pool.
The usual payment scheme most miners will try to push on you is DGM or PPLNS, mainly because the miner doesn't take much risk, you get paid when someone in the pool finds a block. However, the time between rounds varies, and a long running round can really screw you over. You don't get paid until the round is over.
Pay per share is the best from the miner perspective, not so much for the pool. The pool operator has to keep a certain reserve on hand to keep paying you when the round goes into overtime. Unfortunately a lot of pool operators have not been good at security and that reserve is a huge target for thieves.
As far as which pools are best, look for the ones that haven't gotten hacked, have PPS (the two usually go together) and most importantly have good uptime, some pools you find that your miner is always flipping between the backup pool and your primary pool.

Bitcoin is not as easy to spend on the ground. You have to have a smartphone, you have to have a wallet app, you have to have someone who can generate those QR codes, they have to know to take a picture of the QR code and then feed that to the wallet app.

You could've said the same thing about the early internet, the early stages of linux, etc. It was the typical 20-something nerd that was into it, got it off the ground, provided the energy to animate it, to get it noticed, etc.
Eventually it spreads out of the geek ghetto and into the mainstream and then at some point the general public and the wimmins are using it. And then it loses its geek appeal and becomes just another part of daily life.

1. Create a database with two columns, one for a bitcoin address and one for the ID, add more columns if you want the resolution to who the address belongs to, to go faster, but it's not really necessary.
2. Make it illegal for any merchant that has a physical presence in your jurisdiction to accept anything other than a registered address. It's a simple lookup in the government database and then you proceed as you normally do.
Then if you want to buy something at say, Wal-Mart you need to first register a bitcoin address with the government. That way they know you're not a terrorist and can track all your purchases to make sure you're being a good citizen.
Personally I don't think it will work, but I think the idea will be almost irresistable to them, once they get the idea. This is of course, after they finally understand what bitcoin really is, but we haven't got to that stage yet. How do I know this? They haven't outlawed it yet or turned on the press propganda machine.
Look first for them to associate bitcoin with terrorists in the mainstream press. That's the signal that they finally truly understand the bitcoin system.

I don't put anything past that crowd. I think it's easier for them just to go in with cops and shut stuff down than it is to manipulate a market. Cops are cheap, buying and selling bitcoin is expensive and bitcoin isn't worth it yet.
The bitcoin market (sort of like the borg) has adapted to that tactic. MtGox will refuse bitcoins that have been associated with theft.
During the previous correction, did anyone notice any "bellyflop" sell orders into the book? A massive sell order that sticks out like a sore thumb?

Try tracking all the transactions associated with your wallet just using blockchain.info. Let me know if you've managed to reconcile it with your wallet.

Well, I suppose if you have to cut your teeth, bitcoin actually is probably one of the most honest markets out there. You'll find that all of the "old" markets are being manipulated with printed money by the Fed. I mean, it's so blatant that they've dropped the pretense and admitted it.
But it doesn't look good for you, even if BTC goes up from here, and I'll tell you why. You have a short time window and you're nervous? That tells me you're a noob. You are going to get pwned by the pros that aren't. Or some algo that can't feel at all.

I told you they were going to start hassling and shaking down the exchanges. They did it with e-gold back in the '90s.
I predict that there may be only one bitcoin exchange in the U.S., but you probably won't want to use it, because they'll put your name on a special list if you trade there. Maybe not right now, but we're only a crisis or two away from a military coup, and then it'll be like every other banana republic here.
It won't stop the spread of bitcoin though, no more than it stopped people from buying and selling pot. If you want to get your bitcoins, you'll find a way.
Even Project Buttonwood may get hassled by the cops, if the people running things start getting really scared of bitcoin.
Here's my prediction - if you want to buy bitcoins in the USSR, er, USA, you'll list a giftcard on bitmit or SilkRoad, if you want to sell bitcoins, you'll buy a giftcard on bitmit or SR.
It's all going to be point to point transfers, they can't deal with anything that's decentralized, they don't understand it, can't control it.

Better to stay silent and have people wonder, than it is to open your mouth and remove all doubt.
I'm not terribly impressed with most mainstream economists. Waxing cynical, most of them are priests of the status quo, captains of the obvious. I've got no real problem with economics in general, but economics should be part of Religious Studies and not part of business or finance, if you ask me. People behave rationally, my ass. Few economists ever predicted any of the bubbles we've seen, most of them have been blissfully unaware of even the most basic indicators.
You and me, most of us are smarter than the average economist.
And the internal workings of bitcoin are indeed a bit hairy even for a technical person, what you need to know to use it, to understand it, is even within the grasp of the most devout economist.
It's decentralized. The pool is finite and predictable. People of all sorts will take it as payment for things. It's money that doesn't have any counterparty risk. I suppose you do run the risk of the internet shutting down, but if that happens, bitcoin is the least of your worries.

Cynically speaking, they don't mind if the cash is used to launder money, sell drugs etc - as long as they're getting their cut. As long as you're on the approved list.
They too need to make money in secret, conduct transactions in secret, don't want people tracking what they're spending on, etc.
If they didn't find cash useful too, they would get rid of it, trust me. They love having complete control, they get off on it. Some point, they'll conclude they can get more control by getting rid of all cash and they'll do it.
Oh I mean, if you ask them, of course they'll be against all that "evil" stuff, but you'll find they tend to be selective in their enforcement of those rules. HSBC gets a pass and some small-time punk like oh, Liberty Reserve gets busted and hung from the tallest tree in the county.
Bitcoin bypasses all of that. They're not getting their cut, and I don't mean taxes either. They may not understand bitcoin, but they do understand when someone isn't paying them their entitlement.

It would be interesting to know what Apple's true opinion of bitcoins is.

They may not like the fact that there's no margins for them with bitcoin. They may not like the fact that there's no big CEO that has to kneel and pray in the direction of Cupertino.

I think it's a great idea. especially if the fees they charge are lower than SR. SR's great and you can cash out there, but they charge north of 10% to do business there.
I can see doing nothing but buying and selling BTC, even using the same platform that SR uses, but having lower fees because the product you're buying and selling isn't illegal (at least not yet anyway).
However it does beg the question, if buying and selling BTC isn't illegal, why not do it aboveground in the public part of the internet and leave the deepweb alone.

You do that until you think the bull market is starting to end, and then you either cash out all at once, or you scale out, selling a bit of your position over time. If your position is somewhat large, scaling out is pretty much the only way to can exit without everyone jacking down their prices on you.

People decry market manipulation in Bitcoin, and if it exists, it's a LOT more subtle than with gold. Spend any time in the gold/silver/PM markets and it'll be obvious - you'll see the same spikes down at the same time every damn day. And then you'll see sell orders that just don't make sense if you're truly trying to get out - either you have to conclude that the seller is really stupid, or they're trying to drive the price down. And with the paper markets, if the Fed, er, JPM really wants to drive the price down, they can always spin more paper off the presses.
I've yet to see that kind of manipulation with bitcoin yet. For the most part it's just people being people with irrational mass psychology that forms definite and understandable patterns.
When most of the people in bitcoin are margined, then we can talk about manipulation as I reckon things.

It depends on how the megabuck got dropped onto the exchange. For one thing, markets aren't static, people would quickly figure out there's a huge bid and start piling on and front running as well. Everyone selling would jack up their prices, much the way a 3rd world merchant jacks up his prices when he sees a rich westerner coming to buy.
Usually, if you're trying to spend money of that order in a market, you definitely don't do it all at once and you try to cover your tracks as best you can (you look like all the other 3rd worlders), so that people will sell you their whatevers at a "fair" price instead of having them screw you over for multiples higher than you'd otherwise pay.

Looking at the long-term chart, the volume has been going down ever since the correction started. 
Corrections tend to go for a while. Anyone remember how long it took after the last big correction for prices to recover and go up again?
It wouldn't surprise me if several someones were trying to get bitcoin to go down further. However they had to have bought every single bitcoin they sell, there's no naked shorting in this world.
So if there are manipulators, they actually have to trade better than everyone else. And at some point they will run out of ammo (as opposed to the futures or stock market where they have infinite ammo).

0. There's always a bull market in something.
1. The less you trade, the better you generally do.
2. Be patient. Easier said than done.
Sometimes it turns into PvP, but generally only if you have a massive bankroll and next-door-access to the trading floor. For that crowd, the markets are essentially an endless series of WSG rated-battleground matches. And that guy, that's what he sees every morning - an endless stream of PvP matches, competitive play.
And some people are very very good at playing PvP, it's what they love, it's what they do. It's not the only game people are playing. Zoom out and the endless WSG matches turn into something else entirely. Maybe like a game of chess or some RTS type game. Or a cross between an RTS and SimCity.

I wouldn't use the precious metals to indicate anything. Those are highly manipulated markets, especially silver, but they are all manipulated to some degree or the other. To a large degree the price of silver and gold are seen as political propaganda tools. 
Bitcoin, much less so. People grouse about how stupid some of the antics are that go on in the bitcoin markets, but by and large they are honest markets - nobody's naked shorting anything, it's more or less people actually wanting to trade, instead of presenting some price point that keeps the public from thinking that their currency is in trouble.
I'd say that gold and silver would be behaving more like bitcoin, if they didn't have the interference and naked shorting in those markets where they do trade.

If you have dialup for internet or worse - running a full bitcoin node more or less assumes you have something faster. Not sure what the bare minimum is, but I would suspect it's something close to ISDN, not POTS.
This is where webwallets actually become useful. They're less secure but if they're never holding large amounts of bitcoins in any one account, and the protocol is light enough to be used over dialup, that's probably what you want.
I wonder if anyone has ported the bitcoin wallet to the OLPC? That would probably be a good first step.

Yeah, I tried the service. It works. But before you order, if you want to preserve your basic anonymity, you need to do two things first.
1. Create a new bitcoin address that you won't ever use again after ordering.
2. Use a mixing service to transfer bitcoins to and from the address.
3. Once you've emptied the address out, never use it again for anything.
Keep in mind that you're linking a BTC address to your real name and address, and anything that directly links to that address (without having been mixed first) is also now linked to your real name and mailing address.
Right now it's only academic weenies trolling the blockchain and seeing what they can de-anonymize, but rest assured if those weenies were being paid by the gubmint, they'd happily create a nice database table linking addresses to names for them.

It got past the old high set last year at $15.4
You can usually make a safe bet that whenever something makes a new high, that it'll run a ways past it.
May not hold on to the new high, may do so. But in the short run it's usually the rule that it'll run a little bit no matter what.
That becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy to a certain extent.
As to why BTC made the initial new high? All the central banks are now devaluing their currencies, some more aggressive than others. That confidence (and money) has to go somewhere, and bitcoin is getting some of that.

I'm not going to pound the table. But experience has taught me that bull markets go further and longer than you anticipate.
At one time, nobody thought the Dow would ever hit 10000. That was some impossible pie in the sky number. But it got there.
When it comes to bull markets, real bull markets, think of a number, some number that makes you jump out of your chair, proclaiming to the rest of us, "That's just nuts! It'll never get to there!" - that's the number it'll get to. You have to do this fairly early on though, by the late bull, everyone is doing that and they're more often wrong than right.
I remember a business associate asking me what I thought of AAPL back in '03, and I said that I didn't want to short it for sure, that it looked like it was in a bull market. I wish I had bought it then :P but I don't believe in stocks anymore.
I bought bitcoin, because like AAPL, I concluded based on my own observations and experience, that it's in a bull market, and I actually believe in it.

This is what they did back in the '30s. 
1.) They put up notice saying "turn in your gold". I suppose it was the original "cash for gold" scheme.
2.) They made it illegal to posses
3.) Afterwards they didn't break down doors. All they did was require that whenever a deposit box was opened, that they be allowed to observe.
And that was it. Tell me, what deposit box are you using to store your bitcoins in? How exactly would they be able to tell if you had any bitcoins on you when you walk through customs?
These are not exactly the brightest people. Some of them may understand something about bitcoins, but for the most part, they're still blissfully unaware of them.
When they do finally understand what they are, I would expect all sorts of very amusing hilarity to ensue however. They will try to make them illegal, I suppose, but enforcement will be a nightmare for them that I don't want to even begin to contemplate.

More likely to get a keylogger and a rootkit installed than have someone bruteforce the private key.
All these public/private key encryption algorithms have at their heart a trapdoor function, which is easy to compute in one direction and very hard to compute in reverse. Elliptic curve encryption has been around since at least the mid-90s, and if any academic researcher found a weakness, it would've been published by now. Who knows what the NSA thinks about it - they don't say shit as far as I can tell. Well except for that Snowden guy anyway. There is concern that if quantum processors become practical and affordable that might break the encryption, but other than that, there's no potential threat that I'm aware of.
If you notice carefully too - Satoshi minimizes public key exposure. The bitcoin address isn't the public key - it's a hash of the public key. The public key does make an appearance in the blockchain, but you either need a hex editor or something like blockchain.info to see it. 
There are some concerns about RIPEMD160, but no public weaknesses have been published. And SHA256 is secure at this time and Satoshi requires SHA256 to be used twice, so it will probably be a while before SHA256 becomes unusable.
You're more likely to get hacked by looking at pr0n than you are anything else.

If your buy order is small, isn't going to knock the order book back too much, a market order won't get you the best price, but you won't be screwing yourself too much.
If your buy order is big, that's a great way to piss your money away and get less for your money than you otherwise would.

It happens mostly in the futures markets, that's the tail that wags the dog. Naked shorting is their primary tool to control price rises. That and margin hikes.
Also you notice the same price spikes at the same time every day. Also the way they dump sell orders into the market, it's not what you would do, if you really wanted to get the best price while selling, either the entity dumping the silver contracts is dumb (and rich) OR they don't care about the price they're getting, they just want to get the price as far down as they can.
None of this is really news, zerohedge points most of this out periodically.

Dunno about XOM but AAPL is in a bear market. I could've told you that a year ago when it peaked and I went on record saying AAPL is over. But hardly anyone ever listens to me.
So at some point BTC will overtake AAPL, just because AAPL is going back to where it was before it bubbled.

Markets don't care about inflation or deflation - they care about UNPLANNED and UNANTICIPATED inflation or deflation. If it's modest and predictable, markets can discount it properly. They can do this without even breaking a sweat.
What something like bitcoin (if it becomes a defacto reserve currency) does imply, is that governments won't have any leverage or ability to manipulate currencies like they do today. But is that a bad thing really? Is Teh Bernank really the most competent person to be telling us what the value of the currencies should be?

Why would they shut down a public chat forum that's not breaking any obvious laws? And to get conspiracy on this, their first option is usually to pay a bunch of people minimum wage to disrupt a forum first, then they try DDOSing it and only resort to regulatory harassment if all of that doesn't work.
If you've been paying attention too - nobody except for coinlab is even trying to open a BTC exchange in the Land of the Free. Bitinstant doesn't really count (you can only buy not sell and there are no limit orders or even a transparent order book), and besides, they're really unreliable bordering on criminal.
I know I wouldn't try opening an exchange here, it seems a great way to employ a bunch of lawyers though, at least before they run you out of town. If you can get out of town before they jail you.
It doesn't surprise me that the feds (in their various forms) know about the major actors in the bitcoin world or that they would be interested in chatting with some of them, but don't take inaction for approval.
They may not really understand bitcoin fully yet. It's one thing for those of us who are technical enough to understand or are still young and mentally pliable to understand, but it's quite another for a government bureaucrat to really get bitcoin. Reading an article on Forbes about bitcoin does not constitute understanding it. I wonder how many people in those TLA government agencies, how many of them have even installed a bitcoin wallet? Of those, how many have actually jumped through the hoops to buy bitcoins on MtGox? Of those, how many have actually set up a mining rig and know the difference between DGM, PPLNS and PPS?
They're a bit in a bind - I'm sure they'd love to shut it down, but attacking it directly or even voicing disapproval over it would just drive more people to look at it and adopt it. Nothing says "Shut up and take my money" like something that's forbidden.
They can't really manipulate BTC via naked shorting (yet), the most they've been able to pull off is just crude DDOS attacks.
The sad thing is, if they would stop printing money, bitcoin wouldn't matter and people would still be talking about that new form of WoW gold and how all the druggies are using it to buy their mollies or whatever.
You feds really want to kill bitcoin? Stop fucking the dollar up the ass.

Also funny you've noticed the 1% per day "magic cap" that the PM markets exhibit. Pretty reliable, that 1% move a day cap is. At least when it's to the upside anyway. Downside of course, there is no cap, ha ha ha.

Nah, that isn't how governments will try to stay relevant IMHO. Buying bitcoin? That's a good one.
They'll hassle the exchanges first and anyone big enough to go after for exchanging or facilitating exchange. Mark my words, at some point in the future, you'll be exchanging bitcoins for physical cash from someone you meet in a coffee shop, at least in Murica anyway. It'll be illegal, people will get busted for it like they get busted for dealing drugs, but the profits and the value of bitcoin will be high enough to keep attracting people with little to lose.
And due to the gubmint's policies, they keep minting more and more people with little to lose every day.
They'll probably hassle independent merchants next. The megacorps they don't have to worry about - those guys will bend over for the gubmint. It also wouldn't surprise me if nobody advertises they accept bitcoin, but if you ask, they'll pull out a screen with a QR code on it. Some merchants will get busted for this too, but the richer and more connected ones will be able to bribe their way out and keep truckin'
I can't see any gubmint trying to buy bitcoins. I think that they might try to set up some imitation of it in partnership with some of the megacorps. I wouldn't be surprised if their most favored bitch Google would be involved. Probably some bastardized NSA-friendly form of Google Wallet, where they see and track everything in real time and can use it to jerk you around. I predict it will go over like a lead balloon and will be introduced way too late for anyone to even think about adopting it. Won't stop them from trying and gubmint bureaucrats are full of - Bright Ideas(tm)
And rich people these days don't have to change their identities and go into hiding, why would they do so 12 years from now?
Saudi Arabia and NK? I would think Germany or one of the other N European nations would have a bigger bitcoin balance. Germans are all over bitcoin like white on rice.

You're misunderstanding. You're free to think about silver in whatever units you want to. What units do you usually think about silver in?
And we're not arguing points of law here. And rationality does not apply as much to markets as you think. An old saying - "markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent". Or if everyone thinks the sky is red and they're trading as if the sky is red, you're going to get your ass handed to you if you trade as if the sky is blue. 
Yes eventually they'll figure out the sky is indeed blue, but before then, you had best keep those mutterings about the sky being blue to yourself.
You could say that most markets (at least the trading kind) are at their base, fallacious and that to operate in those market, you too, have to think fallaciously.
You can argue further about this, but money speaks louder than words do.

So to summarize what you're building, you're building a bitcoin exchange/trading platform - in Haskell. Great whoopteedoo. Who cares what you write in as long as it works and most importantly is SECURE.
Come back when you've actually got something that works. And that won't get hacked in the first 3 months, because the internet is full, full of smart poor people with oodles of time on their hands.

Well, if you have a spare 800 bitcoins lying about, avalon is willing to sell you their chips. You can get a reflow oven, make some EAGLE diagrams and produce your own board.
What? It's easier just to complain? Probably so. But does complaining make you more bitcoins? Probably not.
