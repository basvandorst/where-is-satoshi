Dear Customers: We're in a liquidity death spriral; we need to be in a static state so we can divvy up what remains and get out of town without wasting our time addressing your withdrawal issues.  We assure you the last one out of the building will turn the lights out.  Sincerely, your Mt. Gox team.

And my magic cards.

I'd suggest the mayocoin as support, but with all the flogging I see going on around BTC it would be impossible to cap them at a finite number.

Buffett is a useful idiot: shrewd, cutthroat investor that tries to pretend he is just a country bumpkin, claims he wants to pay more in taxes while simultaneously spending 10's of millions of dollars with tax attorneys to avoid paying them, argues against the keystone pipeline because he owns railroads that transport oil.  Would most likely lose money if BTC prospered so wants to kill it.  Wouldn't trust this dude.  Hope his $1B check clears when I submit a perfect NCAA bracket.

Not an indictment of BTC per se, but if you KNOWINGLY engage illegal enterprises and use BTC to facilitate the transaction you run the risk of indictment.  Would be no different if SR had accepted paypal and encrypted their transactions to make harder to trace: We wouldn't indict paypal as a result, but Shrem's charges would be identical.  He knew SR was trafficking in illegal transactions, knowingly participated, and apparently thought he was too smart to get nabbed.

Don't they have bigger things to worry about?
