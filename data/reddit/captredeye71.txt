He really does. I like tracking how often he feels this need.
He bought at 19. When did you sell Coastmonger?
My 40% increase makes me want to sell so I can claim Coastmonger saved my play money. If I only listened....BLARGH!
Remember to stay sane and only gamble with money you can lose. Coastmonger wants to be a pin against the horrible violation of him selling early, bubble or no.

Out at 42.50. NOTED for coastermonger.
I purchased at 31.00 on 2/26. My $11.50 per BTC happened in 8 days.
I can't help but feel guilty for thinking longer term.

BTC : You can still withdraw up to 100.00000000 BTC provided you have enough on your account (your limit is 100.00000000 BTC per 24 hours )

Mt.Gox does have limits for Americans. Comes down to regulation. Ppl argue for and against FinCEN. Privacy vs legitimacy to banking laws.... Just pointing out what everyone knows.

The truth that Mt. Gox ruined the run.

I know this isn't r//platebitch but I was rejected for the same reason. Mine was DEAD2U. I did however get BCNU2 for my 1969 Bonneville Hearse. So it evened out for me.

With a receipt showing fiat total you can file it. Getting a receipt would be the hard part. Having the person or organization send you a receipt for a donation when you do it anonymously would be the most difficult.
