Ok so not very useful at the end of the day

Why don't you start your own bitcoin exchange instead of whining? @_date: 2018-01-07 15:57:50
lol 600 this is laughable
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:14:16
No high fees and slow TX are good for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:13:00
Adoption will *never* happen. Just like Segwit.

How much time dies it take to open a channel? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:09:19
According to number of tx per day, it is eth 
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:08:58
I just don't see the point of this post
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:51:05
How does that prevent you other cryptos to be on top of btc
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:23:32
this is actually a classic TA patern.... It's called the double double-u

Money has value because it is money and it plays the role of being money.
Just like skates have value because they are skates and allow you to skate.  
It is that simple.    
Bitcoin is money, and nothing else.  (Therefore it has value)

I thought big blocks is bad here?

It's everything but cheap to transact in bitcoin actually, bitcoin is digital gold
@_date: 2019-07-02 02:57:50
There is a street value of USD, and an official value. Thats why. No money to be made with ''arb''

Imagine if all the bankers in the world dont have income anymore.... Imagine how much food, gas and material for housing the planet would save
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:53:48
When you build something and want it adopted, you need to think in a practical way. You need to develop a solution that will be good and implemented on planet earth, not in some fantasy perfect world 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:21:37
Oh right they are attacking the bitcoin network by doing transactions. Very malicious!

What the hell has this sub become? How is this the number 1 post. r/bitcoin = meme central
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:56:32
The mempool is skyrocketing and fees also. This is because a block can not be bigger than 1mb.  Dont move your coins, they are a store of value.
edit: yes, be patient, very patient
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:00:24
So you are telling me that you ''forgot about bitcoin'' when during times that your holdings were worth around 7500$? very hard to believe, especially if you were 19 y.o. Also: ''I doubt it has real value'' you are telling me that you held your bitcoin and never sold ???? I call BS

Make it attack proof

Thing is with LN another coin will take over before LN is implemented + adopted
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:59:56
Bitcoin will die before LN

Asking a exchanges  who receives thousands of tickets per day to implement segwit is not a block size increase
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:22:56
I've always had more trust in business people than politicians /advocates /groups etc in terms of knowing what's good in a certain market 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:17:17
Honest question: What is the incentive for coinbase to to so?  I'm understanding coinbase has issue keeping up with the extraordinary growth of accounts, relations with custumers etc. What would segwit do for them that is so important?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:41:38
How can we be sure it's an attack though not just people moving their coins? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:11:04
The real fool is not them it's you, BCH might be good and have a bright future, thats no reason to sell btc after a crash and buy a coin a the top of a bubble. I hold 1 bch for each btc I have, in case these ''fools'' are right and I don't trade
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:44:09
If I choose bitcoin as my preferred currency, isn't normal that I have 0$??? what do you mean? Until you convert your USD to euros, you have 0 euros. ok... ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:57:40
Skyrocketing fees are good for D economy
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:22:07
They can choose which alternative they like best. They know what's good 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:02:17
Nothing holds you from starting a exchange, and implement segwit. Nothing holds them from doing wtf they want with their excahnges
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:29:08
So basically the faith of bitcoin is between the hands of bcash shills? I guess they won then

honestly who needs class when u play in the NFL
@_date: 2014-10-20 18:50:46
i'm pretty sure they need to hold only a certain percentage though .... same as the banks. They need to have enough to supply their customers who want to ''withdraw'' their gold which is really low
@_date: 2014-10-11 00:50:21
I think the movie did an excelent job explaining bitcoin protocol/history and presenting the community to the masses/idiots. I was quite entertain even though I didnt actually learned anything ( I didnt expect to anyway)
@_date: 2014-10-21 22:00:34
1. Which other p2p/blockchain projects do you find the most interesting and why (openbazaar counterparty ethereum etc)
2. Where can we find the presentation you did at the CIA? If we can't find it, what kind of reaction did you get?
3. The hash rate is now approx 240 ph/s. I doubt the huge grow in difficulty of last year is due to consumer mining. Do you suspect any government/agencies/corporate entity to be running a huge mining operation secretly
@_date: 2014-10-20 05:00:22
Do they do fractionnal reserve banking with bitcoins? how much % do they need to hold?
@_date: 2014-10-11 14:43:06
my bitcoins are mine
@_date: 2014-09-20 22:15:09
You should use bitcoin QT, or multibit
@_date: 2014-02-04 00:27:30
Yes of course!
@_date: 2014-10-16 03:48:06
i saw a segment of the cia presentation cant remember when. the audience was going crazy when he was saying stuff like money that a central bank cant control and stuff like very disruptive. it stopped then i was really pissed
@_date: 2014-09-21 18:54:45
You're right. I can now see the double shoulder patern flip flap over shoot to the moon very clearly. This shit about to blow
@_date: 2014-09-20 22:19:17
Just look at a 1d or 3d chart you dumb fuck and you'll realize the trend havent changed. price went up a tiny bit yes because of fools like you 
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:11:49
you would prob be liable and cucked IRL

thank you my friend this is a brilliant piece of work!!! You are a genius!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-02-02 20:18:41
utterly irrelevant.......... market cap of btc is a fraction of platinum's market cap
@_date: 2014-10-20 13:59:24
Thanks. Is that the case for all etfs? in particular gold etf?
@_date: 2014-02-04 00:00:43
Gold: protection against a total collapse of the monetary system / protection against inflation 
Bitcoin: Maybe the currency of the future
@_date: 2017-02-01 04:11:21
replace price by market cap
@_date: 2017-02-08 06:02:49
yes it happened to my friend
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:44:22
Dig up on it... they had a credit crunch.  peoples account were too leveraged and when price swinged too hard too quick, positions werent settle automatically. it wasnt a hack, people who were on the wrong side of the trade just defaulted their margin. that is what happened. Same as mountgox.  Fractionnal reserve banking. Dont have on an excahnge more than what you are willing to lose
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:32:56
This time Chinese markets won't let you w/d your bitcoins. Way different. This never happened before. Except once and we all know what happened
@_date: 2017-02-09 15:11:45
This is textbook bearish news. You are allowed to sell your coin but not to buy them (you can ''buy'' coins but not withdraw them, so it's not buying. it's a virtual claim on digital money from a 3rd party)
@_date: 2017-02-15 15:44:55
Doesn't need to become a reserve currency for us to become rich. We just need countries to go under or at least crashing currencies to create genuine demand.  we only need a tiny fraction of people in these countries to see BTC as safe haven and that will drive btc price higher and higher.
look at columbia, venezuela and russia (russia has INCREDIBLE volume and a really sexy exponential growth)
and the most important of all, russia
very interesting to see SUCH demand in russia... their economy hasn't really gone under like venezuela, but still their volume is half USA's volume... why this much growth in a country headed the right way (economy wise)... their media doesnt hide bitcoin like our medias do and their currency is falling quite a bit due to obama's sanctions
so i have incredible faith in btc now that we can confirm *SOME* people see btc has safe haven.. And that ''some people'' doesnt have to be big at all... Bitcoin is still the tiniest market of currencies... every tiny drop of fiat in btc represent a huge bull run. wait until the euro goes under if they do and now we are talking
@_date: 2017-02-15 14:40:24
You can w/d coins from okcoin.COM and not from okcoin.CN (correct me if i'm wrong but i'm not)

@_date: 2017-03-24 22:45:34
I'm not offended 
@_date: 2017-02-16 17:48:49
You need to look up the real price on LocalBitcoin which is about 7200 yuan... Bitcoin are still the most expansive in china. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:59:55
Lol ''offensive''? Are you some kind of Bitcoin SJW? You have to be kidding me. Money doesnt care if you are offended this is counter productive thinking
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:42:03
Why so many decimal points then?? 4 of them are now unusable.. They weren't intended to be useful? 
Maybe bitcoin is not intended to be micropayment but all the decimal points are meant to be useful and blocksize need to increase

You can't buy all the asics.  Its like saying banks will buy all the bitcoins. It would skyrocket the price.  If the banks decide to buy all the asics, asic companies will have more money for making more asics, and these asics companies would have more mining power

How do you ''withdraw'' bitcoins?
