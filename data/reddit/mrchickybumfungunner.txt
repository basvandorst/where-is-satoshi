I’m sure a European country became energy neutral like 2yrs ago no? 
Anyway, thanks for the breakdown. I should say I ‘hope’ mining advances solar technology. I’d like to think solar could eventually offset some of the power needs.

I’m no expert obviously lolz...but yes it probably will be a problem in the short term but I think we’ll solved the energy crisis in the next 5yrs. Bitcoin mining / miners will provide a whole new bunch of clever people to approach it from a new perspective for new reasons and solve it quicker...

It’s so extremely important to maintain Satoshis principles and by stepping away he did the most important development of all. If you love something - let it go. By walking away he removed the final centralised link in the chain - himself.
He knew he had changed the world and then in the blink of an eye...he’s gone.

“It's not like you put in work to earn that money. “ They too have done fuck all :)
So I’m confused as to why the government is entitled to a piece of it?
If you’re earning money from local industry such as property investment then I guess the rationale is ‘our land / our country, pay us’.
Blockchain isn’t any countries property, industry or overhead. So what right do they have to try and tax it’s use?

I meant I haven’t sold it for fiat...even though I might have to soon.
I feel like the ‘value’ is arbitrary...yeh it will spike and dip as the mainstream adopt it but using it in everyday life is when you really understand how it works.
Bitcoin (for me) isn’t the investment platform that it’s known for today. It’s a nice way to control your money with the security of ownership and access.
I believe fiat is a dead format, so my plan is to hodl and use it as payment for the future once things have settled. Still early days for most.

Really cool post and great catch...
Identity that is routed in biometrics and synced across a distributed ledger removes the need for any type paper ID card like passports, drivers licence.
Adding in AI into the mix and things get interesting...
If the deepfakes algos are so available and learning all the time then surely the valid identification of a person via the way their face looks could be based on how recent the image is?
If we have always on surveillance that’s keeping a constant updated image of our face this morning / on the way to work then identifying someone in digital or in person is just accessing the ledger for syncing or comparing - the input could be a screenshot of a person in a deepfakes video, a location, a transaction, a post. Even if it’s fake the meta data could be vast enough for it not to matter.
I don’t think we’re a million miles away from facial recognition, ai, machine learning that could completely re-write what we know and think about ID. The meta data in a deepfakes porn video could show the origional cast, the faked cast, their full biometrics, who deep faked it...all by image interrogation. After all our (sexy) bodies are completely unique. If machines have seen us grow and change over the years they’ll spot us in a crow of millions.

I'm a Lloyds and Revolut customer. Fuck Lloyds to the highest possible degree. I don't like to swear but they really are biggest cunts around.  
It's a good thing Lloyds have restricted Crypto purchases with credit cards and here's why...
This should stop idiot kids spunking money they don't have on technology they don't understand in the hope of getting rich by next week.
I mean lloyds are only doing it as they know these kids won't be able to pay back their cards when they fuck-up.
1st rule of investment - only put in what you can afford to lose.
1st rule of gambling - never bet with someone else's money.
Anyone stupid enough to do both of those deserves to be crying into their Golden Grahams while wiping their fresh boy-tears from their crimson Blockfolio nightmare.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:07:09
I’ve been in the crypto game for years and I’m still in no way an expert. I personally find it complicated.
However as a precaution I’ve moved all my assets away from Coinbase and into a secure wallet.
The entire point of Bitcoin is decentralisation. Miners and exchanges want to make money - throwing their weight around and centralising control goes against the basic principles.
Again...I’m no expert but worth revisiting why Bitcoin was created and using that as a benchmark for trust.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:57:13

@_date: 2017-10-31 06:38:32
Yes. Banks can suck a big old bag of dicks.
Yeh Bitcoin is ‘like’ gold in the way it’s valued but you don’t pay for milk and bread with gold...or do you?
Im saving my Bitcoin to use as currency as this is it’s intended use. Investment is just a by product of something new that has value. Moon bitches!
I handle all my finances, security etc through apps and platforms that use crypto currencies.
I find the way banks are desperately trying get a slice  of the pie laughable and pathetic.
Still happy charging my start-up £50 before any transactions went through...after taking 3months to setup the account (Yeh that you Lloyd’s).
Still happy charging ‘international transactions fees’ on every single transaction abroad? They really can fuck off.

There’s loads of modern digital currencies...all of which were started for wealth. Bitcoin is the only truly decentralised store of value as has no agenda.
I don’t think any store of value will ever surpass it’s value per coin. Plenty have and will have more features than Bitcoin but it’s not a mobile phone is it. One thing done well / properly was all that was needed.

It’s was great dude. Such an exciting but frustrating time.
Wallets broke. Coin was lost. Doge ruled. It’s was hacked, fixed, patched and driven by the community of hardcore techs, devs and people that got it.
When I say got it...I mean really got it. Not these idiots chasing investment gains.
Bitcoin is and will always be about a better, safer, cheaper and more secure way to transfer value between human beings. It’s primeval.
Ignore the news, press, TA, fud...it’s all bullshit.
Satoshi invested Bitcoin to solve the major problems of greed, corruption and basic human rights. Understand that and you won’t care what the price is.
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:41:20
Forget about the price guys. It doesn’t matter.
If you have Bitcoin you’re very lucky. Hold it. Don’t sell it.  Buy more.
Bitcoin is one of the rarest forms of value in the world.
Every second Bitcoin survives another 20 blockchain companies launch, making use of this incredible technology and cementing Bitcoin into history as the first and only decentralised crypto currency.
It will never turn off.
It will never stop.
It’s value will only increase.
It’s importance will never be fully recognised.
Doge also rules.
