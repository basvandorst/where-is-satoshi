Remember, we want adoption.  People will be people.  The best way to maximize adoption is to make responses as concise and palatable as possible.

Do you have a source on an easily accessible walkthrough on these techniques?  I've heard them referenced a few times but don't fully understand how it works or how it's used.

I sold a small amount that I use to play around with right at 7600.  At the time I was glad I didn't sell yesterday.
Made me glad that I restrict myself from the majority of my portfolio.

annnnnnnnnd now you're hooked.  or disillusioned.  or maybe both?

Banking was also the best thing to ever happen to people. Neither is scaling adequately any longer and will eventually be replaced

What if those paths are intertwined and we don't fully conceptualize it yet?

Agreed. The six billion unbanked of the world will trust bitcoin more than the almighty US dollar.

There will never be enough bitcoin for even the current US population to own 0.1BTC each. There are many billions more people who will only ever know satoshis and hear stories about when whole numbers were attainable.

Can't it be both?

Now I am interested in THAT *son*!

If you have been this disciplined thus far, do not sell at 5x.

It is something - it is 626,000 satoshis

Respectfully disagree.
