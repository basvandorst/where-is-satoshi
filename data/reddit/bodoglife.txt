Pretty sure every bitcoin miner is sold for more bitcoins than it will ever mine.  That is why they sell it instead of mining with it themselves.  If you're only doing it to make money then ya you're a fool.  If you're doing it for the educational experience and you're really into bitcoin, then that will partially make up for the financial loss in buying the miner.  However if your friend is truly interested in cryptocurrency and mining, I would recommend building GPU rigs to mine scrypt-n, X11, and other new coins.  Trade some or all for bitcoin, only keeping alts that they believe have potential.

35:02 "they just took a big chunk of the bitcoins available in the world out of circulation"
* no, they seized about 27,000. there are ~11.75M bitcoins.
* if you're referring to Ross's 600k btc, they didnt seize that.
35:15 "it was first introduced for trading december 30 2010. $.30 per bitcoin, not too promising"
* wrong.  gox opened for trading in mid 2010 (it was open in July 2010) at like $0.05/btc.  even before that people traded pizza for 10,000 coins or $1 for 1300 coins.
35:20 "DPR posted about bitcoin on his blog Jan 27 2011."
* DPR did not have a blog.  he posted about Silk Road on Shroomery and Bitcointalk under the username altoid.
35:45 "on june 7 this year bitcoin hit $30/bitcoin.  remember there was that chunk of news people were trying to farm bitcoins bla bla bla"
* no.  it hit $30 in June 2011.  it was $100ish in june 2013.
* its called mining bitcoins, not farming; although some people refer to large rigs as mining farms
36:00 "with the takedown of silk road we saw bitcoin value plummet a little bit and recover slightly.  all of this points to bitcoin being a real currency."
* it actually dropped as much as 30% immediately but recovered very quickly.  it was $127 before the bust, and $123 now.
36:12 "it's acting like a currency should act.  this is what you would expect from a currency thats not make believe."
* all fiat currencies are make believe
* bitcoin has been "acting like a currency should act" for years now
37:45 "the hub of all the dirtiest filthiest most bitcoin dissociated bitcoin malfeasants was shut down all at once"
* Silk Road did not allow weapons, counterfeit currency, in general they didnt allow things that you could use to hurt somebody else
* Black Market Reloaded (  )
* Sheep Marketplace (  )
* Deepbay (  )
38:10 "what would happen to the dollar if apple got seized by the US gov"
* bad analogy since all the Silk Road vendors are moving to BMR, SMP, and Deepbay and using PGP to verify themselves
39:06 "there was a panic people started to sell them. ive got a bitcoin ive got to sell them before my mom finds them. she'll think i'm buying drugs.
* this is a dumb comment.  hiding bitcoins from your mom is very easy
39:20 "whats gonna happen at this point is will there be an ongoing market. cuz 5% of the bitcoins on the planet; the FBI is trying to find that wallet. once the FBI finds that wallet they own 1 in 20 bitcoins."
* yes there will be an ongoing market
* they're not trying to "find that wallet"; if they have an encrypted version of it they obv want to decrypt it.
* suppose DPR had 600k bitcoin. the largest btc address is 111111 bitcoin (  ).  so even if he has 600k bitcoin he has it spread over several bitcoin addresses.  each address would take millions of years to brute force the private key so its kinda safe to say that they're not gonna "find that wallet".  they may however torture Ross Ulbricht into handing over that wallet.
42: 45 "let me go devil's advocate and i dont actually belive this but i wanna stoke the fire a little bit: is it actual property?  it's entirely virtual.  when we think of cash. we can move numbers around on a computer.  it has roots on a physical object. bitcoin has no roots in a physical object."
* hopefully he realizes that fiat currencies are virtual
there were some decent points towards the second half/end of the bitcoin segment:
* our money is a consensual hallucination. yes
* the act of trying to mine bitcoins make current bitcoins more secure
* i do believe bitcoin is here to stay

bitcoins are literally numbers on a ledger.  that ledger is called the blockchain.  the blockchain is on 10s of thousands of computers around the world.  what prevents counterfeiting?  military grade cryptography is used to implement a triple entry accounting system on the world's most powerful distributed computing network.  governments cant steal your bitcoins.  governments cant debase your bitcoins.  you can spend your bitcoins however and whenever you want.  you dont have to trust me, Satoshi, or anybody else using bitcoins in order to trust the system because the system is open source and governed by the laws of mathematics, not the whims of politicians.
