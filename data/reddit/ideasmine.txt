The simple answer is: Why Bitcoin’s gone up to $20,000 from $0.001 in just 8 years, without any major inflation!
If that happens in 2020, will be able to buy a couple of Lamborghinis with $1million for sure!��

Keep a proof of buying with $BTC and auction it in 2025 or 2030 when $BTC price is much higher, because your lawnmower would be most expensive on this planet! ��

In fact nobody knows what happens next in Crypto! It acts and reacts as per the news than technical analysis/charts!!
@_date: 2018-07-20 08:38:31
Your statement is wrong bro! Bitcoin is still 8 years old! If your statement is correct, you're trolling an young boy!!����
