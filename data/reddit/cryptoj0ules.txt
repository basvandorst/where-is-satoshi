Any proof he actually died? Death certificate, funeral, obituary?

What I know is that he had a hot wallet and cold wallet. The Hot wallet is accessible and visible, but the cold wallet location and Address is unknown. The cold wallet is in the encrypted Laptop that no one has access (or so the story goes), like a U-Boat that sunk off of a shore and took everyone and everything down with it in it's coffin.

Dude.... OP said he didn't want something technical. People telling him to get a hardware wallet... Yes that's probably the best bet but OP wants something not technical and easy.

At what point in the history of  did that account only have 1674 followers? I'm curious because it looks like Twitter restored that account but i'm trying to figure out at what period of time they went back to. Am i right?

I agree, that Twitter account should be in his control. We shoudl start a poll or Vote to have Twitter hand over the account to him.
