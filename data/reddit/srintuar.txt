Merkle tree's only work if you can download the full list to validate. (so they would also have to publish the full list, they only have to sign the merkle root)
It also only works via hash trust extension - the fact the transactions are verifiable means they can be merkle'd in a block header. GOX balances are not coins, they are something else; So while mtgox could publish a signed root of a hash of account numbers, it would not prove anything regarding their solvency, unless they also posted everyone's balances publicly.
So yes, a full open ledger with total information could prove their solvency, and a merkle tree would make it signable in a way that allows fast verification. but then it would be a huge breach of privacy.

Absolutely agree about offline wallets. 
In this case though, the online computer that accesses his bank account was where the theft was from.
I suppose this person had 3 days to inform his bank to cancel the transfer, or to move all the funds out of his account so it would bounce.

If you controlled a large amount of mining hardware, you could introduce a large delay into transaction inclusion times by only mining empty blocks.
your Cost/benefit is nearly the same, because the blockreward dwarfs txfees.
The solution is either to wait for the blockreward to taper off, or to increase your txfee enough to tempt the miner.

I think this post is missing the point; bitcoin isnt enabling the money laundering bypass,

If the donut shop makes direct bank deposits or credit card refunds, it will be caught and

But if the store refunds cash, then that is what enables the bypass, not bitcoin.

this is the answer; keep your balance ZERO.
There is no need or reason to keep either a BTC or USD balance at coinbase.
@_date: 2014-02-12 04:31:23


Not sure what you mean; deposit to a single address?  (a wallet is not a primitive in bitcoin terms)
Thats not ideal for any case; the best is for each address to be used exactly once, then never used again.




Tracking bitcoin balances alone is actually pretty risky. I think its better to track unspents (i.e. coins).  If you track ttl balances for individual users, you had certainly at least audit the backing in unspents. And all unspents should be monitored for unexpected spends/thefts in any case.
I know its probably common to use a radically simplified model - but we are
still quite early in the crypto currency revolution, so unsurprisingly the technology
still has quite a bit of teething to do.

Thats one of the schemes, yes. But if you are not at home, and the 3rd part is down, then your coins are stuck till you can get back to cold storage. this is an important point. 
Also, this particular scheme is particularly bad for anonimity.


Yes, but there are no multisig scheme's wihtout this property.

Well, the host OS is ultimately what matters; if the host is network connected, then the VM is like it or not.
also, there is very little you can do with an unconnected machine other than sign transactions, so you dont need anything elaborate. a small netbook or equivalent is fine.  you will need a connected machine to check balances and craft unsigned transactions, and for that I'd recommend a mac or linux of some kind.

If you have malware on the machine with the wallet, then the transaction destination will be re-directed to the wrong place, it doesnt matter if you have 100 different signatures.
multisig isnt helping in this case.
@_date: 2014-04-06 17:39:38
I mean that the actual payment request and associated information is all outside the blockchain.  Compare it to P2SH, which puts extra complexity in the transaction that ultimately spends the coin, doesnt have many options for extensibility, and directly impacts the scalability of the blockchain and complexity of a fullnode;
IOW, fullnodes dont need to understand bip070, only wallets. And even wallets that dont speak bip070 can still interoperate.
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:15:27
Well, if you read the paper written by the researchers who were trying to trace the identities of wallet holder through the blockchain, combiniation events, or "de-dusting" as you call it, was the primary phenomenon which allowed them to identify wallet holders.
You are right that if you spend large amounts of coins naively, it will tend to de-dust
automatically, and thus compromise your anonymity. The solution to that is to use a wallet which controls the individual coins. 
There are implementations out there that allow you to do exactly that.
Tumbling generally does not de-dust very much; it should result in a patter of coins that doesnt match the original set of tainted cons much though, so if you have 100 dust coins to tumble it would have to de-dust in an early step simply to change the appearance. This is a risky choice however, if the illicit coins werent tied together apriori
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:55:58
If your keys only stay unlocked long enough to sign a transaction, there shouldnt be anyway to harvest them from RAM even if they could perfectly read it all.
(unless they somehow interupted the process in the microseconds while the key is in RAM before it gets to calling OPENSSL_cleanse on the keymaterial )

So hashes of various chunks of the file are used to generate series of 
AES keys, that then separately encrypt the file in a sequence of streams.
Still vulnerable to chosen/known plaintext attacks, and inferior to treating
the whole file as a single chunk. Also, the decrypt key would have to be 
far larger than is usually needed.

Whats wrong with calling them MAC's ?
And true, untrusted binaries are the problem.
But, in general, its hard to find workable untrusted binries for a linux, since you cannot release a single universal binary that will work on them all.
and there is a cultral barrier to running random binaries. 
If mac users gained that same culture, and had a wider variety of distro's so a single binary wouldnt run on but a small fraction of mac's , they woudl be a harder target.
but a single provider closed source ecosystem is weak, is the bottom line. like it or not, mac's are not fundamentally stronger then PC's , just less of a target for now.

You were hacked and its too late to stop it. You lost the roughly value of an economy car.
Some thoughts:
You were using windows. This is a major mistake for bitcoin handling, logging into email accounts, logging into bank accounts, or anything similar. Remember: when on a windows machine, you must consider all your keystrokes to be public information. I'd suggest getting a mac or installing ubuntu for handling money and secrets. You can game on windows, and possibly use a credit card with a very low limit and watch it like a hawk.
You chose Bitcoinqt - which is an excellent fullnode, and use can use it to have a local trustable blockchain copy, to post transactions, possibly to mine, and also to simply be a part of the network in general.
But never-ever never use it as a wallet. The wallet built into it is very unsafe and poorly designed.  The plan for the project is to eventually phase out the wallet, and simply provide a pure bitcoind.

It doesnt work the way petertodd is selling it.
You still have to publish all the material that is hashed up into the tree or it is meaningless. 
Merkle tree's do two things: allow you to detect where a large file is damaged, and allow you to more quickly validate a hash of a large dataset using a small header and come back later to validate the whole content.
The use of merkle tree's in bitcoin allows you to only download block headers without needing to download entire blocks. (because you can trust someone else is checking the whole blocks) A fullnode still needs to see the whole block before it accepts it.
Merkle tree's are not some sort of handwavy magic.

BIP0070 looks nice-ish, at least so far as giving a consisitent user experience and
commonizing things such as refund-addresses and receipts, but it terms of security it really adds relatively little.
Any payment system build on top of HTTPS already has the exact same PKI infrastructure that would power BIP0070's security validation. It does add
some interesting extra layers perhaps:
* you wallet app can check the security on top of your browser's PKI check
* you dont post the transaction to the blockchain, you post it to a https service with a payment message. ( if the server refuses unexpected payments, then you could sweep your coin to stop-loss)
The most interesting feature of this protocol is this:
* Customers have a real digital receipt that proves that the company webserver did indeed request the payment and what its for, plus proves that you made the requested payment.
Till today, most digital "receipts" are little more that easily fakable screen shots or unencrypted emails. a BIP0070 receipts would be the first common provably genuine receipt system in existence. I image that expense reimbursement systems will one day refuse to authorize old-fashioned receipts any only accept these cryptograhpic ones..

Coins are always "traceable".
Tumbling only creates plausible deniability. 
Remember a transaction destroys N coins and creates M new coins.
So if you have 1 "tainted coin", and you mix it into a transaction
with five normal non-tainted coins, they are all destroyed 
and lets say 10 new coins come out. The question is which of the new coins
are tainted ? All of them?  none of them ?
literally, imagine tossing 5 legal gold coins, and 1 stolen gold coin into
a pot, melting them down to liquid gold, then re-casting 10 new smaller
coins. also, you do this blindfolded in a room with strangers, and without
having to trust or even know them.
Who even owns the new coins ? It could be 10 different people, or it could
all be owned by one person now.
Sometimes intuition and legwork can puzzle this out, but after a certain
amount of value has flowed past many such transactions, it becomes
impractical to follow the flow of value from coin to coin.
This doesnt have anything to do with the tax situation however.
For taxes, what is important is which addresses you claim to legally own.
For those, you would need to explain each reception and each spend of
coins to and from that address.  So even with tumbled stolen coins,
which now look like legit coins, you would still need to launder them the
old fashioned way, in order to pay taxes on them, by coming up with
a legitimate documentable explanation for how you obtained them.

using a 3rd party means your coins can be frozen (no internet access, their site is down,etc) you cannot move your coins alone. If they dont have some form of automatic release, such as a time delayed refund transaction, then your coins could be lost forever.
Also, it defeats privacy, because this third party knows who you are and what you are buying, hell, it even uses 2FA so it knows exactly who you are via a phone number.
Bitcoin wallets properly behaved will not be trackable via the blockchain, and your wallet should never be stuck in escrow with some wacky 3rd party.
There was a huge meme here advocating 2FA instead of real security, and many people got burnt.

Qt the library is fine;
Bitcoinqt's wallet always starts unencrypted; it shoudlnt even have that option.
Also, it grows, adding tons of new addresses as it is used. There is no easy way to backup like with electrum, so you have to deal with making copies of the wallet.dat itself. Worse, imo, is that there is no offline function.

Systems that make it easy to craft a small universal binary, then easy to install and run it, certainly help users to hurt themselves bot MAC and MSFT platforms have a cultural concept of for-pay closed source binaries from untrusted sources, and thus make it far too easy for an uneducated user to do something they should not be able to.

I buy 100 satoshi for $100   (Coin A)
I buy another 100 satoshi for $200  (Coin B)
I have two coins in my wallet (A,B), each distinct, each worth 100 satoshi.
They are trackable forever, and recognizable.
If I spend coin A, taking back 50 satoshi in change (to coin C), then I stil have
two coins, a new one worth 50 satoshi (Coin C), and one worth 100 (Coin B). Coin A
had a basis of $100, so I can assume the 50 satoshi I spent had a $50
basis. and my new change ( coin C )has a $50 basis as well. Coin A is spent
and thus destroyed.
Does that make sense to you?

I think the bitcoind API itself is simply insufficient for the running
of a money handling service.  Personally, I dont think it is even
suitable for running a receive only service, much less a hot wallet.
minor changes I would make:
* Eliminate wallet from bitcoind, and all wallet related API calls
* Allow query of unspents by dest-address across all the UTXO (basically index utxo by pubkeyhash) filterable by minconfirms
* sendrawtransaction should reject malleable unless a special flag is passed to override
* Standardize JSON for transaction request and signed transactions (because binary/hex transactions dont include enough information for offline signature generation, and there are competing conflicting standards) that is suitable or integrated with BIP0070
With the above changes, I think we would see far fewer amateur-hour bitcoin merchant implementations.

I do hope they dont use the native bitcoind wallet for their hotwallet.


Yes, of the blockchain. But it is not a good accounting ledger, nor a business

While its almost ok as a desktop wallet, its really not a fine server side
hotwallet, imo.

Strictly inferior to BIP0032, especially with i extended to 256 bits:
Payment receiver publishes a BIP0032 rootkey and chaincode
Payer generates a random 256 bit number for a nonce, and sends a payment
to the address at that offset. Then informer the receiver which offset was used.
Receiver generates same address to confirm payment (public only needed, superior to this stealth address concept)
Anonymity comes from the fact that the 256 bit space is too large to search by brute force, so unless you know the number its inscrutable.

The technique the electrum is both a brainwallet and not a brainwallet, in some ways.
You cannot choose it; so it has the property of being fully random 128 bits of entropy (strong)
The words derived from the 128 bits are fully reversible, so they are actually just an alternate representation of the bits.
But, the fact that you can easily memorize them makes them a usefull passphrase.

Thats true if you receive change. If you spend coins  B, and coin C, and receive coin D with 25 satoshis in change, then you have more than one choice as to how to set the basis for coin D.

they are spent, or FIFO as our tax lawyer describes.

The linux laptop is a good start. 
But 2FA doesnt really do anything much. I recommend using it, but 
dont rely on it in any way.
You password was anything but strong however:


This is an incredibly weak password, believe it or not. 
BIP0038 can protect even weak passwords like that (but BIP0038 is
kindof limited in that it can only protect one private key at a time.)
I suggest picking a stronger password next time: use diceware
or electrum to generate a set of english words, and use that as
a password. (easier to memorize, and far harder to brute force
or crack) Dont try to generate one from your own mind.

There is obviously a lack of any inherent physical value
But it clearly useful because of its secure transferability. non-physical things can have utility, or else there wouldnt be any concept of trademarks, patents, copyrights, communications, etc. Bitcoin, and the ownership of specific denominations of it have an obvious utility, because people are using it. You could exchange it for good or services.


This is true, it generates neither losses nor gains. Exchange rates can fluctuate, but btc does not inflate or decay. this property is similar to a metal.
So while it is different than an investment property, it does share the properties of a commodity.

What is a "compels password" if you dont mind my asking ?
Is it possible it is your email server that is compromised and not your individual account?(ie. what email provider do you use) Or even barring a compromise, your email's sysadmin could simply access your mail directly. 
Something has to be compromised; either your pc, your email, or coinbase itself.
if its coinbase though, the attacker would take thousands of BTC, i suspect, so i think it unlikely they would only target a handful of users.

historical parallels to bank collapses mean nothing - its a cute analogy but 
ignorance of how bitcoin works + a detailed knowledge of history does
not enable you to make any useful predictions. 
For one thing; there is no way for one insolvent exchange to affect another.
Second thing; unlike a traditional bank, bitcoin exchanges are not subject
to runs. Its perfectly possible to have an exchange with very low to zero deposits. 
Lastly, unlike a tranditional currency, bitcoin exists outside of a bank; every person who
holds any amount of btc is an independent banker.

It sounds like there are far more key problems
* Using a web-based wallet for half a million dollars worth of bitcoin
* Having a very large amount of btc protected by a few private keys
* Not using BIP0032, or a similar strong technique to generate new receive addresses without having access to private key
* Not directly dropping to cold storage for all received amounts
* **Logging in to the merchant account from a personal computer!!!**

I dont modify bitcoind, i use the trunk of the official client, and code review each update before I accept it. right now im probably a few weeks behind HEAD.
My own daemon has a completely separate codebase. It creates a non-blocking socket to connect to bitcoind on lo, and sends jsonrpc calls equivalent to getblockhash getblock getblockcount. (so no, i dont read the files directly, because that would be bad juju )
My demon then turns around and serves jsonrpc to other internal clients. 
I try to keep a simpler subset of C++ than the bitcoind crowd, who have infested their source with boost and all sorts of vintage MFC style programming techniques. to each their own I guess ;) At least their code is proven to stand up to open P2P traffic on the wild internet.

I dont think a bitcoin transaction will be done in a grocery store line. Some other layer on top is needed for
that, IMO. I see bitcoin more as a very fast ACH transfer. this is not a fundamental flaw, imo.


Human's have lived in a stable currency environment for most of economic history. and they have dealt with it
just fine. Deflation crises are a fractional reserve phenomenon.




This is one of the easiest problems to solve; there are countless hundreds of safe ways to solve this,
and the problem is well understood.




These are features and part of the design, fundamentally, and I dont see them as weaknesses,
but as the basis of its strength. And you can hold bitcoin off the internet, you only need an internet
connection to receive new coins successfully.

most people dont have server hosting abilities, and sharing all your coins with a 3rd party oracle service out of your control sounds risky / stupid to me. I could probably host my own countersigning daemon, but I'd be pretty screwed if went down. (all my coins are now frozen till i fix it) I'd also enjoy the benefits of paying
extra txn fees if it is up, and the total loss of privacy.
A hardware wallet with a bip0032 coinpurse gives you everything you need from a security POV, without needing an internet connection to an oracle server. An eletrum style hardware wallet that doesnt even really store your private keys would be even better.
I predict failure for cryptocorp, at least as far as multisig goes.

Good point: client support is pretty poor right now regarding choosing inputs.
You can easily choose outputs in many clients, creating a transaction with multiple spends, but almost none let you choose coins besides  .
The downside of brainwallet's signer is that assumes a single signing private key, which
I think should never be the case. (not to mention simple brainwallets are unsafe for anyone)
I really think a proper advanced client would let you do a coinpurse type of operation
which would help the user track the pedigree of each coin in their wallet, and
control when and how they are spent, and even estimate how anonymous
each coin is based on the number of tumbles.
I should work on a coinpurse wallet, i think.

How is that related to multi-sig ? Who do see holding each key ?




How do you gain more security for cold storage from multisig ?
Having your funds locked so that you cant sweep them without
the third party permission is dumb, imo.




I havent needed escrow, which is what it is useful for. Perhaps if I bought a house
or something huge, I could multisig during the purchase inspection phase, but
I pretty sure the seller would want the final transaction cleared through to a single
destination before they gave me the keys. Even in this case its marginal, and
I'd only put a small fraction of the price into escrow at most.
Its pretty easy to use, and seems to be fully supported in the fullnodes and blockchain.
bitcoin-cli seems to have no trouble signing them.
There are currently just over 25k multisig coins in existence on the UTXO.

If you have an offline machine, then all it can do is sign a pre-prepared transaction.
(Several bitcoin clients have this ability.)
if you move the prepared signing request to the offline machine by USB key, then move the result (a signed transaction back) then you have never connected your offline wallet to the internet.

I'm imagining thats fine to get started. Most corporations have ridiculously divisible shares, probably far in excess of need, imo.
A single MBTC can create 100,000 starting shares. you can easily divide it up to among 10 shareholders with a stake of 10,000 each. This is enough for a small business or partnership.
A single BTC has 100,000,000 shares, and at 10k shares each, you can have up to ten thousand unique shareholders. This is enough for a fairly significant midsized business, imo.
Anything beyond that might call for a brokerage to hold shares on behalf of smaller shareholders. If you cannot afford as much as 0.01 % of a company, buy through a broker.
Also, if BTC usage goes up, and the network scalability improves I'd expect the minimum output size to be reduced over time.

Its strange how the current exchange ratio of bitcoin to USD is considered
to somehow measure the success or future utility of btc. I see it simply
as the dollar having a surprisingly good week. This tells very little about
the future of BTC. 
To see how well btc is doing, I look a the number of unspents, the tx frequency, 
and the number of merchants/traders who transact in it. The big factor will
be closed loop; once there is a complete economic circle of activity denominated
in BTC, I think we will see an inflection point in adoption. 
The price in dollars may never go higher, if the dollar continues to do well.


Can you name a specific foundational concept that you believe is weak?
the blockchain certainly has some weaknesses, but so far as I can tell, 
the foundational concepts are simple and solid.


You said that exchanges dependent on the USD value of btc would cause a
chain reaction, but I dont see it. An exchange, being what it is, should profit
the same whether the price is going up or done. Otherwise, its simply 
horribly mismanaged, and that has nothing to do with other exchanges practices.

If the new distribution of money was perfectly fair and even, it would be the
same as not having inflation in the first place!
The point of inflation is exactly that; to shift weathy with minimal pain and friction.
It doesnt accomplish anything else. (no new value is created via an increased money
supply. )
Inflation absolutely hurts the worker; look at the real wages of an factory line working in 1950 vs 2014. The former could maintain a houshold alone, the latter is on food stamps with a double income family. Wages have not and do not keep up with inflation. 
The worker who is in debt does not get more cash income to make the debt load easier to pay off, the debt-service effort level maintains roughly the same level as when it was opened. The creditor sees reduced benefit because of inflation (which is why we have fannie may, or banks wouldnt bother with home loans nearly as much)
In a growing economy, not-reserve currencies might lead you to expect deflation, which is
considered scary, but wrongly so:


In a deflationary mode of a debt economy, the deflation becomes run-away deflation.
Non-essential parts of the economy shut down fast, and the poorest struggle to survive.
This is not the same as natural deflation; natural deflation is driven only by gains in 
productivity, and not by a vast reduction in debt creation causing a chain reaction.
In a natural economy, the rich can only spend their money once, and do not have a
mechanism to re-fill their coffers periodically with new debt. The poor only have to
pay interest on actual debts, and are freed from paying interest on inflation. 
When a poor person defaults on debt, they lose their house, their car, and the credit rating. When a rich person defaults, a company or other such proxy declares bankcrupcy.  Non-debt economies eliminate debt from the working poor, and they will buy assets with real currency. the proportion of their income dedicated to servicing debt decreases radically, and they are incentivized to save.
In an economic downturn, the average person is more likely to have savings to fall back on, and are not liable to lose real possesions overnight.
Those holding large amounts of a deflating currency do see a proportionally larger
benefit compared to those holding less. But it is far less drastic than the disproportionate benefit seen under debt driven inflation.

Brokerages, wealth managment firms, personal investment advisors, retirement planning firms, and their ilk will exist. Those are not "banks".
A bank is a place that can print money via loans, preferably loans that will be held/redeposited within that self same institution. The funds have meaning only because of their remittable utility, the fact that the funds appear most perfectly liquid despite not really existing.
This is one garment; pull the first thread, which is the need for business and personal savings and checkings, the second thread - making loans that never leave the bank, then the third thread, the ability to print money, all come un-done in turn.

Okay. I cross check between my bank and coinbase contantly, and I would have closed the account in a second if i even suspected compromise. (its a dedicated bank account only for coinbase anyway)
I really think the only explanation is email compromise; either your account, your server, or your admin.
I have never reset a password via coinbase; does it require more information than just an email response ? (for example, a bank will require some security questions to be answered)  
If not, then email exploits are truly an achilles heel; they certainsly arent PGP encrypted or anything, so they are simply a flagrant security vulnerability. I dont see coinbase doing anything about it though, I could recommend requiring more factors to reset account passwords- such as security questions.
you might do well to switch to a brand new decidated gmail address that you dont use for anything else for coinbase purposes. Same story on the bank account side.

If they gave a hard guarantee to offer personal  proof to all valid users,
then user X could claim that GOX denied them proof of their accounts backing
coins under root XYZ . The community at large could either then accuse GOX
of lying, or else force GOX to dox the user's info (effectively turning the
full gox ledger public like I suggested) Or else gox could claim that user X
missed the window for root XYZ and now theyll show under ABC root.
If they really do have the coins, and noone ever claims they wont give a
base for their account, and they really dont change/update the merkle root
for a very long time, then that might work. But it only takes a few rumors
to shake confidence (forcing full disclosure or uncertainty)

Since they are serving users as they request the detail privately, then they can ensure they would never reveal a provable conflict publicly.
Unless all users got all the info and all shared it publicly, it proves nothing.

As you descend the tree, incremental balances and information shown are assumed to be valid, based on trust that the stuff we cannot see is also valid.
To actually do an audit, you would have to show everything, or at least enough to cover all current users.
anything short of publicly releasing the whole set, or allowing the sum of all (or at least most users) to collude and report their private information, and it doesnt really prove that all the accounts are backed by real btc.
OTOH, a single error, collision, or double-accounting would prove fraud, that lack of that doesnt prove anything until the whole set is auditable.
If you were to post a list of all balances, and sign
the whole thing via a merkle root, and instead of the account
number you instead posted a hash of the account numbers,
then you would be able to demonstrate
* all coins are fully backed
* no private user account numbers are given out but
* the whole set is released and tamper-proof, so if there is
any fraud it could be discovered
(for example, a user finding the has of their account 
claiming a much lower balance than it really has)
Also, please be aware that if you account numbers are guessable,
I.E anything less than UUID level randomness, then you
risk leaking more information than you want.
Also, if you use coin signatures or coin messages, please have a good RNG,

For this reason, brokerages, banks, and governments have been able to print gold, by fractionally reserving it. (Read about germany's attempt to withdraw their gold from the US reserve. )
number 2 reason:
Even still, inflated and all,  Gold has gone up 100 fold over the last 200 years:

Even if you never got the email, lets say it was intercepted or deleted before you read it, you might notice that the password you set was not the one needed to log into the site, correct ?
* Once you saw the purchase notices that you didnt make, you still had at least three days to clear out your bank account; at the very least you could drive to the bank and withdraw it all and then ask them to put a hold on the account
* If you then changed the password to your coinbase, it should not have been possible for the attacker to log in again. The only way for the attacker to re-learn your password would be to have control over your PC, or to reset it. If they reset it, you would notice, because when you try to login it wouldnt accept the password you set. 
The only explanation that holds up is a compromise of your PC. It still doesnt make sense that you allowed the purchase to proceed through your bank account however.

false; the number of coins is indeterminite and unbound. Managing the UTXO is a big concern, which is why OP_RETURN was finally allowed as an escape valuve.
However, the sum denomination of those coins is finite and predetermined, however

mostly the impl ive seen used (for example in bitcoin-qt) also locks the pages in RAM, so they cannot be dumped to swap or jumbled around. 
The problem with bitcoin-qt is that it likes to leave the wallet unlocked for macroscopic time periods. writing a very small, fully auditable tool, which only does one thing, signing transactions, and then immediately does a clean exit, it a much better way to work with bitcoins in paranoia mode, or if you are afraid of laptop jackers or cell phone muggers.
Its also more safely solved by having multiple separate wallets, and not having too much of your net worth in any single one of them. (so you dont have to unlock your whole life savings all at once)

bitcoin would not function outside of a comunications network with a RTT over about ~3-5 minutes. Longer communications times increase the probability of successful attacks on the blockchain, double spends, etc.
So a network, similar to the bitcoin network, is pretty necessary to the proper functioning of a temporal cryptocurrency such as bitcoin.
This has some interesting implications; you could probably get a bitcoin node setup on the moon, but you most likely could not operate a bitcoin node on mars as it would be slightly too far away. So yes, to the moon, but no, not to mars.  )

A transaction is quite simple, a list of inputs and a list of outputs.
inputs are existing coins that you want to spend, plus a proof that you have the right to spend them (a scriptSig). outputs are new coins: and amount of btc plus an address (aka scriptPubkey).
You can generate the scriptSig from a private key, and a list of unspent coins that it can unlock. to make a script scriptPubkey, you just need to know the address you want to send btc to. (and possibly another address you can send change to)
you dont need to know anything else about the state of the network to create a transaction.

Thanks for the beer!
multisig is kindof a niche thing: of 7.5 million unspent coins, only 17k are multisig. it makes things more complicated for sure, but I don't think it will significantly improve security, imo.
The server that makes payments does not strictly need to have bitcoind running. As long as it knows the unspent coins that it has access to, the amount of btc in each coin, and the necessary private keys, it can create transactions without knowing anythnig else at all. It could also send itself change, and add those coins to the ones it knows about. 
However, to add outside coins in to it, there has to be some way of informing it of new coins that it can spend. If it is not running a fullnode, it has to depend on something else to inform it about new spendable coins.
The web service that generates new payment addresses to receive funds *does* need to have access to the blockchain, preferably on a private full node. The corresponding private keys that it receives coin in to should not be in the hot wallet on the payment server, imo, it should be an offline wallet.

Mining does not create really new coins, There are exactly 21 million, never more or less. (some may be unrecoverable)
Some of the coins just havent been allocated to anyone yet.
Mining is merely the process of determining thi first allocation of the coins that havent been used yet.
In any case, its still not printing dollars, even if you see them as new coins. 
The reason is that pinning something to the dollar can be done for any commodity by anyone. All you are offering is a guarantee to buy or sell the commodity for the given price. When you lack the power to create or destroy dollars or the commondity, the pinning is usually meaningless, because it would instantly bankrupt anyone.
No person or agency has the power to instantly create or destroy bitcoins, so the only power that could realistically pin bitcoins to dollars would be the Fed. Even then, they likely lack the power.

Correct, It would have to have the same output value. This means you have given a new coinbase to the current coinbase owner, overwritting theirs, and getting nothing in return.
Today, you would replace their 50btc coinbase with a 25btc, losing your 25 in the process. Not much of a good deal.
In 12 years however, you could turn their 50bts block into 1btc, at a cost of 1 lost btc to yourself.

Five boats bodbbing on the same ocean wave might look stable compared to each other.


Gold has gone from 1700 to 1200.
My stock portfolio has boomed, even though the companies arent doing especially better.
The same house sitting in the same lot has ranged from &lt;300K to &gt;475K in a handful of years. (all due to dollar fluctuations, both in value and supply)
To me, this is quite drastic.
Some of this is supply and demand.  But supply and demand itself waxes and wanes with the supply of money.

* gold is almost as good as bitcoin, so contrasting it vs gold doesnt make much sense. in which way is it better?
* where did these elders get their old gold from ? why were they handing it out, was it also being mined?
* ultimately, any story so centered around bitcoin mining misses the point of bitcoin. Early mining is kindof not the point of bitcoin, thats merely a way to bootstrap the system. perhaps if we kept satoshi's originial term, "timestamp serving", it wouldnt be so romanticized. 
maybe the story works if the elders are handing out pieces of paper as money, then satoshis gets people mining for yellow metal, and suggests it should replace the paper because there is a fixed amount of it. there is only 21 pounds of it in the mountain, so the mining is not central to the story really, and the fixed total amount and non-forgability are the key morals.

1. Wal-Mart would certainly be happy to give less money to the major credit card companies, if it is possible. BTC has to first prove itself stable, common, and honestly boring as hell before its taken straight up. Even then, its possible that most retailers dont want to be taking payment straight off the blockchain. 
2. Absolutely. waiting for 10 minutes per confirmation is just too long for small purchases up to say 500 dollars about. I expect that "bitbanks" of some kind will be used for common everyday purchases. (either based on green addresses or else completely off the blockchain). 
3. This problem is already solved with credit cards, why would a coin based payment be any different? I imagine at first stores will offer their employees a way to cash-out to fiat same-day.
4. You set the rates when you started the journey. If you are taking payment in fiat, its the customer's responsibility to come up with the fiat. Vice-versa, and even more likely, will be people trying to dump fiat on you after youve set a price in bitcoin.
5.  this will depend greatly on the wallet system used. In general, smartphone based wallets have a long way to go, but, this is a very solvable problem.
Your POV is that the Dollar is very stable while BTC is very volatile. At this stage that is quite correct. I suspect the day will come where this reverses: the wild fluctuation of prices we see today is always blamed on the market, or on the economy, and never on the dollar. People are used to imagining the dollar is a fixed point of reference. Gold and silver havent helped reveal this, because they themselves have been subject to all form of manipulation and speculation. 
Once there is a currency immune to manipulation, it will reveal that the dollar really does fluctuate quite drastically. At that point, I can imagine a rush to fix prices in btc across the world.

I think its healthy to have these sort of detractor threads.
* If bitcoins are used for nothing but remittances, that is still a 514 billion USD market value as of 2012. this could mean multi-million dollar values per coin, assuming btc isnt used for anything else at all.
* Smaller transactions can be safely done will fewer confirms. ACH transfers take multiple days and dont progress on weekends or holidays.
* Major International corporations have a liquidity problem; their overseas holdings are hard to move between countries without paying massive taxes (apple alone has over 100 billion usd overseas) using bitcoin the currency could be rapidly repatriated. Even better, storing as bitcoin will allow on-demand repatriation.
* Tax deferral; In an environment where bitcoin cannot purchase goods or pay taxes directly, small companies which keep revenue in bitcoin form could defer taxation until the coins are converted to dollars. (i suspect this is already starting) The reason this may work in the short term is that there is no clear "fair market value" for a bitcoin. Even moreso, if the bitcoins are respent rather than converted to fiat, it becomes even less clear how to determine their value over the holding interim.

Sortof - its rather implying that copyright law pales compared to software enforcement of copyright. Its the same concept in "Code is Law" Laws written on paper will become less and less relevant, those coded into computers more and more.
Imagine this: You are at a grocery store and the register wont accept your credit card, even though you have all kinds of documentation and paperwork saying it should be accepted.  Who wins, paper or the computer ?
The direction is, I believe, that software and communications protocols will define the future shape of human social interactions. Bitcoin, good or bad, is all about this. Its a method for groups of people to vote for a common truth. Its a method to build a system of trust driven by individual self interest. It applies game theory to the foundation of currency.

Bitcoin is neither deflationary nor inflationary. Is is simply stationary
If the real economy grows, bitcoins deflate, this encourages people to slow down on spending. This slows and moderates the economy, curbing bubbles.
If the real economy shrinks, bitcoins inflate, encouraging people to spend more quickly. The counter-acts recessions and encourages recovery.
The net effect of an all-bitcoin liquid currency system would be extreme stability.

Of course a bubble popped. A dollar bubble. Dollars became very easy to get, so people bought houses beyond their means, up until dollars got harder to get, then it all fell down. This is exactly what would not be possible with houses priced in bitcoins.




You are speaking the conventional wisdom, and its exactly what im addressing: We have been conditioned to see our fiat currencies as the definition of stability, and good's prices as the volatility, when the truth is completely reversed!




There are fluctuations in the price and availability of gold/silver, but it has remained remarkably stable
over historical timescales. (up until it fell out of demand as a currency in the last few hundred years)
What I said about gold was that its value jumps around in reaction to the money supply and market 
feeling, while its intrinsic value stays fairly fixed. I'm asserting that its "price" tells you more about the state of fiat
than the state of metals.


This is a direct consequence of being paid in a fixed amount of fiat.
If dollars became twice as available overnight, labor costs would also halve overnight. (its takes decades for salary pressure to correct this, which is why real wages have gone down for 50 years)
If salaries were denominated in commodities (say gold), then labor costs in dollars would fluctuate rapidly, revealing the instability of the dollar.

2 years sounds both too long and arbitrary.
Wouldnt it make more sense for each planet to have a local version of bitcoin, and to trade between planets simply using longer confirmation times on the same blockchains ?
I see no need for an altcoin to facilitate this..
Earthcoin (bitcoin) nodes can run fairly well out to a RTT of say 2 seconds. (slightly past the moon) assuming they have a good TCP accelerator.
Mars coins work in a similar range form that planet.
A payment address sent from earth to mars, using a one directional protocol, is going to take between 4 and 20 minutes. A block confirming the transaction can arrive between 18 and 50 minutes later at the earliest.
In order to ensure fidelity, rather than waiting 1 hour for 6 confirms, perhaps waiting 3 hours for 18 confirms would be safer.
So, in short moving coins between earth and mars should be no problem; except for a period of time each years when earth and mars are mutually blocked by the sun, transfering earth conis for mars coins should take only 3-5 hours to exchange.
certainly not 2 years.

a popular misconception.
Have you heard of the "currency act of 1751" ?
Thats when the colonial government issued "bills of credit" basically cash, out of control causing inflation. British merchants were being forced to accept the devalued bills, and were not happy about it.
In many of the intervening years, the dollar had been pegged to gold or silver in notion only. Paper Dollars far exceeded the redeemable amount of gold, and actual metal volume of coins has steadily decreased via the series of "coinage acts".
The dollar has always been a Fiat Currency. 
You could say it became a de jure one in the 60's, but that was more a recognition of reality than a change.




You do realize that the era of fractional reserve banking had already begun by then.
The volume of dollars was free floating. You could take out a loan and buy liberty bonds,
with brand new never before existing dollars.
To restate: you could instantly devalue every dollar in existence to buy a promissory note backed
by the future work of fellow citizens. Thats what financed WWI, and variety of subtle and invisible




Yeah, Gross an massive government spending via the New Deal. Yep, thats the only way to have a viable economy.


Easy to increase prices by devaluing the money...
More interesting is why the great depression started in the first place... you have to rewind back to 1913 for that.
You position is that the problems caused by a fractional reserve currency can only be solved via massive tax
and spend public policies. (Basically you are a communist, economically speaking)

Of course that is the gov't position, and the correct thing to do.
there are challenges though
Bitcoin has many of the properties of cash. People who perform transactions in cash tend to under-report taxes, be they waitresses or store owners, etc. (Alternatively, small businesses may overreport earnings in order to serve as a laundering service, but this is less useful with btc)
Even a business doing its darndest to report vs fairmarket value at the time of barter has no clear point for calculating FMV. should they use MtGox ratings ? Maybe localbitcoins ?

no, you have to include a transaction. However, its more vulnerable type of transaction, since it doesnt have the guaranteed uniqueness, and can be overwritten by a new coinbase.

Good advice above.
One thing I would add:
Have a computer dedicated to only doing bitcoin, and nothing else.
Especially dont use it to browse the web, play games, etc.

Remember to backup your wallet somehow. Copying it to a usb key or printing it to a piece of paper will do, but keep those things in a safe place.

Interesting parts of this proposal:
* statistical analysis of the coins before agreeing to mix
Poor parts of this proposal:
* Overcomplicated
* requires trust with thousands of strangers
* not superior to coinjoin proposal already in existence. (zero-trust required)
By default all bitcoins transactions should be mixed/joined tumbled. Once it is an ordinary practice, it will become less remarkable. 
The idea of vetting peer's proposed coins is interesting. Calculating a graph difference between the proposed outputs and the one's you want to spend is intriguing.
even more so if "proof of ownership" signature comes with the solicitation to mix/tumble/join.
@_date: 2013-06-14 23:20:41


Ok, what you said before didnt make sense to me, this is something different.
You arent proposing sending the coins to any address, but instead to an output like the below:
scriptPubKey: OP_DUP OP_HASH160 {CO_addr} OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG OP_VERIFY OP_NOW {expiration_time} OP_LESSTHAN  OP_IF OP_DUP OP_HASH160  {PTS address} OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG OP_ELSE OP_TRUE OP_ENDIF OP_VERIFY OP_AND 
Then, somehow coordinating a signature with the PTS, you would then send coins to
the merchant:
scriptSig: {CO_sig} {CO_pubkey} {PTS_sig} {PTS_pubkey}
When you send coins to the merchant from this output, the merchant would look at the referenced input's {expiration_time} and {PTS address} and of course the logic of the statement to see if its trustworthy, and if it all seems legit, more quickly accept the transaction without waiting...
If, for whatever reason, the PTS stops working between these steps, you can wait till the expiration time is up and spend the coins normally:
scriptSig: {CO_sig} {CO_pubkey}
assuming all nodes recognize OP_NOW, and the 32 bit limit is somehow addressed...
several complexities arise:
* Honest PTS's and CO's have to do a fairly elaborate dance to move the coins
* PTS's addr's wouldnt be safe to use more than once
* merchants  must somehow check that a given PTSaddr is valid and not already used
* PTS's must ensure hostile CO's are getting not them to cross-sign something other than the intended transaction
* Merchants must be very strictly interpreting the OP_CODE's
* Time based attacks become very lucrative; attacking the NTP infrastructure could potentially yield huge stolen coin hauls.
Another problem is the blockchain; what should the network do with a valid block that has a transaction that was created when the OP_LESSTHAN should have failed. (Running the script at the current time would work just fine, it would have only failed in the past.) This also raises the question regarding mis-stamped blocks; if a valid looking new block seems to have an off-time, is it valid ?

* Buy some bitcoin, by all means.
* Do not take out loans, they are insanely risky.
* Do not miss out on your company match - its free money, and goes right into an investment.
Bitcoin is a store of value, not an investment. Don't buy it because you expect it to go up, buy it because you expect itll be worth the same amount in the future. Buy it to spend it. Buy it because you think it will be liquid. But it is not an investment; the coins just sit there once you buy them, they do not do any work.
Speculating on bitcoin is no better than speculating on oil, or pork bellies. Its risky.
I'd recommend taking some disposable cash and using that. leave your fiat 401k alone. Hopefully its all in stocks or very low expense ratio mutual funds. let it grow for 30 years, and basically forget about it. When bitcoins take over the world, those companies will still exist, and they will start accepting and spending bitcoins. Your shares in those companies will still be valueable.
Put some of your emergency fund in bitcoin. Or move some of your expenses via bitcoin, if its something you would normally buy. or set up a mining rig and attach it to a pool. 
Also; If you just HAVE to speculate on bitcoin, do it the smart way: DCA your bitcoins. I.e. set a budget, such as 100$/month. Buy that many bitcoins each month, no matter the price. Set a minimum hold time of 5 years before you consider spending them. Do not trade on margin. Investors with stars in their eyes dreaming of becoming rich overnight are the ones who end up jumping off buildings.

it depends on how they dump them.
If they dump them into USD by selling them on the open market, there is an assumption that there are buyers for the coins in terms of USD. This will rapidly drive the USD/Bitcoin ratio down to the point that people will stop buying them. If they follow the market down, lower the price market to ensure a dump, then it becomes a huge giveaway, which causes a temporary inflation spike in the bitcoin economy. But there is no way to guarantee that they can get the coins back, so this is a one time trick only. unless you can re-sieze them somehow, its not a real threat.
 i suppose they could print the money and buy it themselves. The only thing impacted is the dollar, so no real problem there for bitcoin. pure dollar inflation and the bitcoin economy is unaffected.
The govt could also buy real good and services with it. Same problem as a dollar giveaway, but any damage would be far eclipsed by the fact that the US govt just traded good and services in bitcoin, massively legitimizing the practice.

While this is cool, and possibly very legitimizing, its not nearly as significant as it could be:
* His salary is still pegged in dollars. So he will get fewer and fewer bitcoins as the dollar inflates. (or bitcoin deflates)
* His taxes are still paid in dollars.
* The local government has no income demonimated in bitcoins
Much more significant would be a salary denominated in a fixed amount BTC, coming from a company that receives income directly as BTC, with no fiat conversion in the middle.

This is the fault of your legacy banking system, not coinbase.
This type of system was probably a necessary evil in the days of checks- there
is simply no way to know if a given check will bounce or not. So you must train
people to be very careful with the check drafting.
Internet speed banking could be possibly today, even with fiat money.
But it is in the banks' collective interest to delay transactions as long
as possible. Its also a healthy source of income from fees.
But fundamentally, since there is no real way to verify fiat money amounts,
adding a few days delay in the mix helps to prevent double-spends and
other similar attacks. And thats the root cause for the delay in most cases.

1) Create transaction, co-sign with real PTS, give to merchant
2) Merchant accepts transaction without waiting for confirmations
3) Release competing transaction with shady PTS. Give it a higher transaction fee, so that out-competes the first transaction.
4) The transaction signed by the real PTS and accepted by the merchant can now never join the blockchain.

Inflation probably does not affect the decision to mine. Gold prices also float, and the demand for gold changes. High demand creates high prices beyond inflations power, and that encourages mining.

Bitcoin simply lets you see where you stand economically. Bitcoin lets you store value. Bitcoins allows you to make low friction cash transactions.
It wont prevent the rich from becoming richer, or leaders from abusing followers, or scammers from running scams. But it will simplify our view of what we ownand dont own.

I expect at some point there would be a standard way to trim dead coins.
For example, the first 50 coins from the genesis block are unspendable due to implementation bugs. It doesnt really make sense to keep tracking them forever. Probably every 20 years or so we will need a "regenesis" where a new block is declared the new genesis block, and all previous blocks are forgotten. (anyone holding coins from older blocks would have a ~10 year notice period to move sweep their old unspents. 
At the cutoff block height, the "lost" unspents are tallied, and become a new mining reward. (basically restoring inflation for a while) alternatively, a completely unrelated amount of new coins could be minted.This also has the benefit of shrinking the blockchain for full nodes.
As an alternative to returning to minin rewards, and a proposal more likely to be accepted socially, would be an expansion beyond 64 bit satoshi's. moving to 128 bit satoshi's would allow even further subdivision or at least 96 bit satoshi's would allow greater subdivision of values, at the price of slightly larger blocksizes.
This is more egalitarian than block rewards, because all holders of coin benefit from deflation equally. (if someone dies with the private keys to 1000 BTC, each holder of the remaining known coins gets richer, rather than only going to miners)

I agree with what you are trying to say.
* electronic monetary exchanges are required in the modern world
* physical material based currencies must still be converted into representative electronic units
* Therefore, trading in gold requires just as much trust in a central bank as trading in fiat currency
The bottom line is that unless you carry your gold around with you, and you only buy or sell with real physical coins, and when you accept gold you can immediately test to make sure its not diluted with lead, then you must trust an old fashioned bank. And it you trust a bank, you might as well be trading in dollars.
Bitcoin has different properties.
* you can always test a bitcoin transaction for validity
* you dont have to trust anyone at all, only the math of the blockchain
* everything you need to trade any amount of value electronically fits in your pocket. 
* When you buy/sell in bitcoin, you are your own independent bank.

* massively increased bandwidth needs, just in block headers alone. The CPU and disk load needed just to be a passive listing node goes up up orders of magnitude.

No, but you do have to reveal your public. The reason why a PTS cant use the same public twice though is that would allow CO' double spend.
         






This is the part I think you dont understand; you dont actually send coins to addresses. A bitcoin output is really like a small program, which if it can be made to return true, serves as proof that the coins can be spent, in a certain way and amount.
     


This might be a good idea, at least in this case NTP attacks wouldnt be as much of an issue.
scripts would still need a new operator (maybe op_blockno) to tie them to the block.

The blockchain wallet likely doesnt have a fault in this case.
But the windows phone itself, or the windows phone app likely do.
* Case 1: your phone leaked your wallet login information, now your coinbase wallet is at risk. 
* Case 2: your phone leaked the 1CMMB private key, now any coins at that address are at risk
* Case 3: nothing was leaked, but your phone is secretly substituting different payment adresses when you try to move funds. 
In all these cases the answer is the same:
* Dont use windows!! neither desktop nor phone. Bitcoins and windows dont mix!
* Make a now blockchain wallet. This one is untrustable now.
* Watch your lost coins. Someone will likely tumble them, but its possible they will make a mistake and you can trace them.

First off, please be really careful about what you read online.
Here is another scam being pushed by coindesk:  
Second, please realize that web wallets are all insecure, and and web wallet that tells you it is secure is a fraud. Blockchain's wallet for example describes how it works, and how it could be hacked. Make your own judgement about whether to use it or not, but dont put more than you can stand to lose into someone else's pockets. (thats what you are doing, btw)

Hot wallet systems will tend to have this problem.


This is blatantly false; a hot wallet system that gets accessed clearly has a code problem.




"several layers of protection" doesnt mean anything.
It sounds like the attackers found a methed to login to their server as a user with enough permissions to
read the wallet file. 
Mostly likely the problem has to do with architecture; I suspcet their service was slapped together 
with bitcoind running a hot wallet and a bit of wrapping code, meaning that it was a problem waiting to happen. 
Using bitcoind to post transactions and to validate the blockchain is good. Using it's wallet is bad.
The bitcoind wallet should always be empty (which limits its use to validate incoming payments)

But this trust would have to be shared among every node in the P2P network. And the invidivual nodes have no incentive to care.
An arbitrary node is neither the CO not the PTS nor the merchant, and as long as the transaction has a fee reward on it, they are incentivized to trust as many shady PTS's as possible so they can claim the reward. The merchant cant do anything about this either: no matter if they insist on a specific PTS, the CO could always have a shady PTS on the side, and the average node is incentivized to allow it.
On the contrary, the Green address system doesnt rely on the behaviors of the third parties; if the merchant trusts the green address, then it works. Third parties have their usual motivations. And the CO cannot double spend, the green address holder has an incentive not to attempt it. 
Yes the spending party and the merchant both must trust the green address intermediary, but this trust can only be lost once. In particular, Fidelity bonds can be used to ensure that users offering green addresses have a huge motivation not to cheat, and to keep their systems secure.

This article is bereft of any intellectual value. I'll be downvoting it as well.
The troubles of ~1750-2013 were due to fiat currencies (pretty much universally issued to fund various wars) And to a failed attempt by the US goverment to peg silver to gold.
Earlier, the economic collapse of spain was due to a large and sudden gold intake from the new world.

borrowing fiat and borrowing bitcoin are completely different things.
"Lending" bitcoins is a nonsensical operation. you dont see anyone creating loans denominated in houses or gold. 
You can certainly invest with bitcoins however: The company you are invested in would have to be expected to pay out in bitcoins as well, so your hope would be that the return on investment is eventually coin positive. If the price of bitcoins vs usd goes up or down, that has nothing to do with your bitcoin return.
 This is perfectly analogous to buying stock in a company listed only in ounces of gold. and hoping you end up with more ounces of yellow metal than you started with.

It would still not be safe; Either the PTS wouldnt have enough information 
to double spend, or they would have too much and they could mis-spend the coins just like a green address intermediary. The easy solution is to only use a given PTS address once.








if the merchant creates a new PTS address for each transaction, that would eliminate the problem of a PTS getting too much information. OTOH,
even though they dont have to wait for confirms on the second transaction, they'd still have to wait for the first transaction anyway. So it doesnt really speed things up.
Come to think of it; how do you solve the first transaction problem anyway ?
do yo send a huge number of coins to the PTS+co time limited output in advance, before you know what to buy ?

Pay2ScriptHash doesnt change anything about whats scripts can and cannot do, it just makes it easier to write certain types of payment apps, thats all. (so you can write a dumb payment kiosk that will work for 20 years - in theory)
Using MofN means that you only have to trust the escrow agent. Good for large transactions, yes, but I dont see it happening for small ones, honestly.
Also, M of N doesnt solve the confirmation time problem - you still have to wait for the m of N deposit to clear first of all.

The main problem i see with your proposal is that scripts cannot pull the time. If you have an example that implements this I could evaluate it.
Other comments:
Pay to script hash doesnt change the doublespend problem, by itself.
multisig is a feature that would be more useful for super-lange transactions (escrow for a house)

You are right, downvotes aside ;)
Trading reals good and services does in some sense pay for mining, because it gives it meaning. (who would clear transactions in a system noone cares about?)
In the end however, buying bitcoins doesnt directly pay for the power usage; transaction fee's do. But indirectly, you are correct: using bitcoins provides the fundamental justification to be a Timestampserver/miner/clearinghouse/blockmaker/whatever.
I suspect that the hashcash concept that powers the blockchain is inefficient. Ive been trying to think of a better system of equality voting, but cannot fathom one. all the schemes
ive come up with are vulnerable to pre-compute attacks. the beauty and ugliness of the current system is that the difficulty setting is what makes the network secure, but also what burns so much electricity too...

Currency is always a fixed point problem, and shouldnt be handled in floating points. yes, the 52 bit mantissa can represent quite a few integers exactly, and if you are carefully regimented you can avoid errors, but every place you touch floating currency values you have to have a continuous understanding and discipline.

@_date: 2013-10-31 03:53:22


neither storing nor math is safe. no operations of any kind should be done
with coin values in double/COIN. "do not store currency in floating point types" is like
a basic CS maxim.
use int64 or a bignum for satoshis.
double's having a 52 bit mantissa can be used as a temporary conversion format for a satoshi denominated vale value, maybe, if you are very careful. storing fractional coins in doubles is simply poor programming. 
does the fact that even the simple value of 0.1 BTC have no clean double repr not explain this enough ?

step (2) the insurance deposit (requires you to have more coins than you intend to spend.
With coinjoin, you can spend 100% of the coins you own, tumbled. step(3) splitting: i think this step may be detectable, and may in fact give evidence of "structuring".




Yes it is. If I make a deposit with Bob, then bob is hit by a bus, then im screwed. With CoinJoin the transaction would never complete and I keep my coins. (plus I dont even lose a transaction fee)


Coinjoin can happen P2P.
also, it has much better defenses against audits: you can show your inputs and outputs and even prove them. they will happen to be mixed in with other ins/outs that dont belong to you, but that wont be anything unusual. With your laundry proposal, the 1000 way split is proof of active laundry.
@_date: 2013-06-13 12:55:34
Even if they dont work together; the CO in your example could craft a normal non-cosigned transaction, with a transfee attached, release it on tor to a slow node in the corner of the network seconds after the co-signed transaction. noone would be able to think its an invalid transaction, it only depends on which one they see first. The transaction fee would help the fraudulent double spend traverse more quickly, and the co-signed transaction would ultimately fail, after the merchant had accepted it.
If the address were fundamentally different, such that it could not be spent without a co-signer, the CO could use a shady or fake co-signer, and cause the same problem. (a p2p network has no root authority, by design, so any cosigner would work, even a totally fake one. )
I think green addresses are a simple and safer system.
For fast microtranactions, trsuted third parties are likely, since it seems increasingly likely that the main network will not be a good place for true microtransactions. More likely you will fund a non-bitcoin account on some intermediary site with a few dollars of coins, then the intermediary will settle periodically once the amounts add up to something worth putting on the main network. 
for super large tranactions, contracts and meeting face to face are important. You wouldnt but a house with a sight unseen online transaction.
for medium sized transactions, i think we can wait for the 6 confirmations or so.

Well, there probably isnt a bunch out there. But thats no excuse for making a poor service; remember your coin once stolen are gone forever, and there are no second chances.
For ecommerce, I'd recommend 
* Use a type two deterministic wallet (BIP 0032 style or similar) to generate payment reception addresses on your web service. ( i.e. Your web service shouldnt have private keys for spending.) This limits the damage of a web service compromise to intercepting incoming funds, but that is still bad. To make outgoing transactions, the webservice should generate a request ticket and send it to a spending server.
Have your spending server be dedicated. (encrypted hard drive, etc) it should be a machine that runs only one service, the spending service, and not have any other services running, and no remote login. it should sanity test requested payments from multiple angles. some example sanity tests:
* does the outgoing payment amout match a known invoice ?
* does the outgoing payment destination address match a recorded request address ?
* does the outgoing payment have a large amout ? if so, require human intervention
If all these pass, then generate the outgoing transaction, otherwise generate an error.
Keep only a minimal amout of coin hot in the spending service. manually insert more coins into the spending service when you need to, keeping the balance carefuly under human control.
Someday, something like this iwll exist and be commonplace. For now you sortof have to roll your own.
@_date: 2013-10-31 02:26:28
Just like you do with stocks or bank accounts: diversify.
If you put 100 coins into a single address, you can lose it all at once.
put 25 coins into armory with a 18+ character password, on a computer that has never had an internet connection. make a digital backup.
put 25 coins into a bitcoin-qt wallet address with a password set. make some usb key backups.
put 20 coins on some site you like, online (this will be your trading account too)
put 25 coins into a brainwallet, with a 30+ character passphrase. (make really sure you can type it the same each time)
maybe move 5 coins into a cellphone wallet, to use as pocket money.
Make frequent backups (always encrypted though, i dont recommend clear paper wallets at all). test your passphrases at least once a month or so, to make sure youremember them.

In short, delaying block publishing significantly increases the chances that your block gets orphaned, and the authors seem to ignore this.
Also, the primary mechanic of "selfishness" is that miners will migrate to the biggest mining pool, which is not necessarily happening now.
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:07:48
* Normal transactions tend to be unique automatically: this is because they must spend a unique unspent coin, and include signatures which must have random data in them, among other reasons
* When a block is mined, a special type of transaction call a "coinbase" mints the block reward (coins that come from nowhere)
* since the coinbase transaction doesnt have a unique source, and it doesnt include a signature, there is a risk that it is not unique
* poorly designed mining software might generate duplicate coinbase transactions
* when this happens, the old coinbase transaction is overwritten by the newer one
A hostile miner could overwrite coinbases generated by someone else, subsititing their old coinbase for a new one.
~~As mining gets cheaper, the old mined coinbase (worth 50BTC each) will become so valuable that it might be cost effective to attack them by "wasting a block". This would cost you the power of mining one block and its blockreward, but you would delete 50BTC from the network, denying it to the original owner, and substituting a smaller blockreward from a more recent block.~~
~~If you own mined coins from over a year ago, I would suggest moving them to a fresh address to protect them~~

Yes. online wallets will continue to be an irresistible target for fraud, up until people stop using them completely.
