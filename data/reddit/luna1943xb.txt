You really don't understand why the maximum potential size of the bitcoin economy affects bitcoin?
**The number of bitcoins is fixed at 21million**, therefore its **absolute** value in relation to the main fiat currencies (primarily USD) is important. 
A drop in value of BTC by 100 means the total purchasing power of all bitcoins that will ever exist decreases by 2.1billion USD. 
A drop in value of BTC by 10 represents a decrease by 0.21 billion USD.
Thats pretty different if you ask me and clearly affects all bitcoin users and the bitcoin ecosystem.

You kind of show your naivety a little here because even though you may have worked for the pocket money you have, you are being provided for almost entirely by your parents and it will be that way at least until you are 18. The cost to your parents is substantially more than any pocket money you have I'm sure. They not only take care of you of their own volition, but they are obligated to do so by law. So the idea that if your investments go south they can just decide they won't help you out financially is a bit silly.
You may consider it 'your' money but it is more accurate to say its the families money, and that you have been entrusted with a fair amount of autonomy on how to spend a very small portion of the family money. Sure you worked for it, but you did that while having pretty much every major expense taken care off by your parents. You have been given a tiny stake and voice in taking care of the families finances.
I do genuinely understand your frustration, and despite attempting to be a voice of reason, I will go and spoil that by saying that in if I were a 15 year old in your position I'd probably still just go ahead and do it anyway. 
I mean I wasted at least the equivalent of 200 USD on tradable collector stickers when I was a kid, so I really don't see the big deal about letting a 15 year old spend some of his money he saved on bitcoin especially if they kid has done a lot or research into it as you clearly have done.

Nicely put, basically you said in 1 sentence what i rambled on for paragraphs to say.
But trust me, he understands the point being made already.
He is simply willing to pretend he is an idiot in some weird effort to frustrate and get a rise out of people.

You must be hanging around some pretty dumb people to assume that everyone else thinks this.
I have not met a **single person** who thinks putting money in the bank and waiting will result in them being rich.

I'm not going to insult your intelligence by believing that you don't understand why the total purchasing power of bitcoin affects people with bitcoin. If you are capable of understanding basic maths (which you clearly are) then you obviously understand what I'm talking about.
I assume you just are too stubborn to admit you are wrong, which is typical online. But if by the 1 in a million off chance you legitimately cannot understand why a decrease in the purchasing power of bitcoin of 2.1billion usd is worse than a decrease of 0.21 billion usd for any holder of bitcoin, then you are clearly lacking some very fundamental mathematical education and would do well to address this asap instead of spending time online discussing bitcoin.
Which ever of these two scenarios it is, further discussion is counter-productive.

The entire potential bitcoin economy (or what is called often referred to as market capitalisation) shrinks by 10x as much in a drop from $400 to $300 compared to $40 to $30.

If you are going to be condescending it helps to actually know what you are talking about.
IQ/Intelligence as well as a wide range of other attributes (height, weight) in nature closely follow a normal distribution. In this case the mean, median and mode are all equal, so the Carlin comment is justified in saying that half of people are stupider than average.
It doesn't matter which average he is referring since it is true for all of them.
Your made up list of numbers does not follow a normal distribution so is not comparable to measuring intelligence. I get the point you are trying to make which is that the mean and the median do not always coincide, but this basic stuff you learn at like age 13 no need to come across as condescending saying "Math is hard".
I'm sure most people here know that the median and the mean refer to different things.

Except this is a lot more than just tech.
This is about psychology, business, investing, finance, currencies, economics, gambling and straight up experience in the real world. They are likely to know way more than you do on pretty much everything except technology. And knowing about the tech behind bitcoin isn't really that relevant to using it or being able to determine whether it will be a success or not.
That said if I were your parents I'd stipulate an agreed amount of bitcoin you could buy (say up to $50 worth a year) of your own money and use it as a learning experience.

Size of banking industry compared to bitcoin = MANY TENS OF ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE.
Bitcoin is less efficient in terms of computational power / electricity than the current banking system by necessity. Decentralisation comes at a cost and one of those costs is efficiency.
@_date: 2014-10-08 15:19:33


lol, the obsession with log charts in here is hilarious.
A drop from $400 to $300 is **not** essentially the same as a drop from $40 to $30 unless you are thinking PURELY in terms of returns on investment, and bitcoin is not just an investment.
@_date: 2014-10-25 22:05:50
I got some ground-breaking news for you mate.
It is possible to be interested in bitcoin and not be an anarcho-capitalist.
@_date: 2014-11-22 11:14:02
Most people intuitively if not explicitly understand what inflation is and that a interest rate that is too low and isn't keeping up with cost of living increases will not result in them becoming richer.
You either have a very low view of the general publics knowledge or you are hanging around very clueless people.

He **has** lost the money already. It's **already** gone to the people who sold higher. They have fiat in their hands that indirectly came from the fiat he (and others) invested into bitcoin when it was worth more.
It is simply what is called an unrealised loss.
It is still a loss.

No cognitive dissonance at all.
It's nothing personal.
Our aim is to destroy bitcoin and bring ruin to all those who tried to use it to thwart our backers (the banks, old money wealth, and the government). The methods we use are up to us.
The powers that be simply will not allow a new currency to take over that displaces them as the wealthy and powerful and replaces them with a bunch of tech geeks with a garage full of ASIC miners. It's NOT going to happen, so just give it up.
The reward we paid shills get for ruining the reputation of bitcoin and maintaining the status quo of fiat as the dominant form of money is huge. Far greater than we can get trading bitcoins back and forth between bagholders.
Again this is nothing personal.
I urge you all to dump all your bitcoins and let this entire experiment die, make it easy on yourselves. Don't bring financial ruin upon yourself fighting a battle you cannot possibly win.
Best Regards,
Agent Luna.

Noone is saying what you want to do is impossible, but it is SIGNIFICANTLY more difficult than you are giving it credit for, and you clearly have literally zero knowledge of what you are getting into. The fact that you think everyone else must be clueless for not being able to do it but believe you can do it, speaks volumes.
You are at the stage of [unconscious incompetence]( you don't even know that you are clueless, and that is very dangerous. 
I suspect you will go at this no matter what. You sound pretty gung-ho like you've just discovered the holy grail and nothing will stop you.
My advice, split the amount you intended to invest into 5 portions. Only invest 1 portion at a time. Do so for say 3 months. If things go well, add another portion. If you lose 1 portion, move on to the next one. Hopefully it won't take blowing all 5 portions of your hard earned money before you lose the naivety and hopefully be able to move onto the next stage which is **conscious  incompetence**, where you realize you don't know wtf you are doing and can actually educate yourself on what you don't know. (virtually everything, i'm afraid)

Then read and learn a bit more about the topic.
It's not MY definition of 'lost', its the financial definition of loss, or more specifically an unrealised loss. 
+ _Unrealized gains and losses are also commonly known as "paper" profits or losses, which implies that the gain/loss is only real "on paper." This may be true from a tax perspective, but remember that a loss is a loss, whether it's been realized or not._


What matters right now is fiat. I can hardly buy anything in bitcoin and those things I can buy are still adjusted based on the fiat exchange rate, so those too are essentially fiat denominated goods under the surface.
Bitcoin at the moment does only has value in relation to fiat. The hope for bitcoin is that eventually this won't be the case, but right now it is, whether you like it or not.


not sure what you mean by 'real' value. It's monetary value is what we are discussing here, what can bitcoin buy or sell and that is determined almost entirely by the exchange rate. If you are talking about the value of a the technology thats a seperate issue and has nothing to do whether someone who bought bitcoin at $400 is now experience a lost at $200.


If the price goes back up then at THAT point he will then have made an unrealised gain that may offset his current loss.
Doesn't change the fact that he is **currently** experiencing a loss.
Doing mental gymnastics to pretend the losses aren't real is of no benefit to anyone.

It doesen't matter if there is or isn't a moral distinction between the two scenarios you presented  because the argument for IP law is not based on morals..
@_date: 2015-03-08 13:47:25


Thats the point. Most do not perceive the expected return to warrant the risk, so they stay away.
@_date: 2015-03-19 12:00:01
Every post you make has factually incorrect information.
Russia is not pumping oil at a loss.
The budget for russian government spending is balanced with oil at a certain price. With oil at a lower price, the profits/tax revenue from oil sales is not high enough to allow for the planned government spending.
@_date: 2015-03-19 11:51:08
A currency whose strength is dependent on the price of oil is not even remotely the same thing as having oil be a **unit of account**. 
Oil has intrinsic value, it has uses that are not dependent on its market price. One barrel of oil at $100 a barrel is fundamentally the same as one barrel of oil at $10.

Currencies existed during the world war and had value. 


Well historically the british pound is far more likely to retain its value relative to the Euro and USD than bitcoin is, so I respectfully disagree.
Maybe a 3rd world country might be better off adopting bitcoin, but the major currencies are FAR more stable in value relative to each other than bitcoin is. 
And again it doesn't change the fact that my money is safer in government insured UK bank accounts as British Pounds than storing it in any bitcoin wallet.
Maybe you have convinced yourself that bitcoin is safer than sovereign debt of first world countries but the rest of the world and every single professional investor thinks otherwise.
@_date: 2015-02-13 15:56:31


It is infinitely easier to NOT forget your wallet, than it is to secure bitcoins. Not to mention I don't carry my life savings around in my wallet.


And then I contact the credit card company and tell them fraud has occurred and get my money back.


Luckily my money is in government backed insured account. If the bank defaults, the government guarantees savings up to a certain amount, which for most people is more than sufficient.  I'm sure you will say the government can default theoretically... and I say, I will take my chances with the UK government being able to restore my savings as opposed to trying to defend against highly skilled hackers who have way more knowledge about computer security than me. 
Number of times the UK government has defaulted: 0
Number of times people have been hacked and had bitcoin stolen: a lot more than 0
In fact I'd take my chances of storing my life savings under my mattress before I choose to put it into bitcoin and try to 'be my own bank'
@_date: 2015-02-13 16:33:48
That is not a list of soverign defaults.
The UK government (and quite a few others) has never defaulted in history, the list you gave gives both default and debt restructuring. Debt restructuring is not a default. 
If I lived in a south american country maybe you would have a point of not using regular banks but I would sooner invest my money in stable foreign currencies and bonds than bitcoin.
Additionally the last debt restructuring for the majority of first world countries are due to the world wars in the early 20th century. And if a world war was to break out, you will have bigger things to worry about than if you should have invested in Bitcoin instead of keeping your savings in the US dollar, or Euro or whatever the local currency is.
The value of cryptocurrencies would probably drop to zero during a world war as they become near useless. Tell me how I use bitcoins when my city has been bombed, major infrastructure destroyed and there is no running water or electricity.
@_date: 2015-02-13 16:59:02


Theft? So if a country is forced to default or restructure debt to defend itself in a war, thats 'theft' because your money is worth less? Even if it is 'theft' (it's not btw), I'd prefer to have a fraction of my money 'stolen' from me by the government so that the country can defend itself against attackers, because if the attackers took over the country, do you think they would just let you keep everything? 
No they would steal all your shit to pay of their expenses for invading your country. (Now THAT is theft)
And again, what makes you think your bitcoins will have any value whatsoever during a war?


It doesn't matter if nothing is 100% secure, what matters is it is close enough to 100% that there is no need to worry and it is much more secure than Bitcoin.
 I also know that if a scenario that occurs that causes the UK or the US government to default on its debt, I've got bigger things to worry about than my relatively meagre assets. Additionally in that scenario, Bitcoin will likely have nearly zero value anyway so it is pointless even considering storing my assets in bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-15 00:49:44
Yes I know there has been countries where it has happened. If I lived in those countries I may be a tiny bit more worried it could happen again soon and put my savings in either foreign banks or more tangible assets. However I don't live in cyprus, I live in the uk where there has been no defaults by the government ever, and there is no likelihood of it happening any time soon.
Bitcoin accounts are hacked daily.
Losing my savings to an event that has never happened... OR losing my savings to an event that happens daily...  which is more likely? As rational person I'll put my faith in the UK government over my ability to defend against hackers with way more IT security knowledge than me.
