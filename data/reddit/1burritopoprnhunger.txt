And now it's instantly back up again...

I love bitcoin as much as the rest of you guys do (and my love is probably purer since I'm not an early adopter or investor) but I think everybody's gotten really overexcited about the recent price spike and, honestly, a little delusional.
Nobody can see this "takeoff" except the people sitting inside the rocket.
I would absolutely love to be wrong about this, but all this evangelist bitcoin-thumping only hurts the currency's credibility.  We need at least one more generation until the Powers that Be will have been born recently enough to really "get" the power of modern decentralized, peer-to-peer or otherwise distributed networks.  **IMO only**, of course.

Fuck, I just sent .15 BTC there via coinbase.

I have long wondered this myself and would be fascinated to know the distribution.

BitFloor's cash deposit tab appears to be missing...have they removed that option?

I had to provide a name and address. Asked if I could remain anonymous, was told no.

Well, for me, the cost of a bitcoin is more or less irreverent since Silkroad prices are generally pegged to the dollar.
The general consensus from this thread seems to be "sure, BTC is used primarily for investment and drugs.  So what?"  I don't really have any axe to grind here - I am simply wondering aloud whether BTC is really destined for legitimacy if its primary use is buying pot and MDMA online.

Well, sure - but that isn't really my point.  My point is that a currency whose primary ACTIVE use is black market transactions might find difficulty gaining widespread acceptance.

I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this, but...
...you can feel it because you're an active and constant follower of bitcoin.  Most people aren't feeling anything at all.  Lets be reasonable here guys.

I know you're probably going to go "well, what about an IRL black market where we use dolllars?" ...
..but, yeah.  Why wouldn't it?  Having a cryptocurrency that is used, in significant/majority portion to circumvent the law is definitely going to undermine a perception of legitimacy in the public eye.
