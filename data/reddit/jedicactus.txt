A futures contract is not designed to be "backed" by anything. What? The whole premise here doesn't even make sense. A futures contract is an instrument used to hedge/speculate on the market price of an asset. Collateral used can vary and whether it is cash settled or not can vary but its not "backed" by anything. A bitcoin futures contract cannot be "backed" by Bitcoin, it wouldn't be a futures contract then but an ETF or other investment instrument.

Stolen does not mean wiped out. Stolen coins re-enter circulation once they are laundered. The only way Bitcoin can be "wiped out" is if it goes to a burn address or wrong address for which no one has the private key. In this case, it cannot re-enter circulation and is lost. This is sustainable because the remaining coins can be split into smaller and smaller pieces, meaning no matter how few bitcoin remain, that amount will always be enough.

Is that a joke? You are doing the bank a favor by storing your money with them, not the other way around.

This is my biggest pet peeve. So many people feel entitled to rich people's money. Like they deserve some of it for absolutely no reason whatsoever, just cause it's "not fair".

You clearly have no understanding of the history of money, the current financial system, or the technicals of Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin is the next evolution of money. It is one of the smartest investments you can make.
