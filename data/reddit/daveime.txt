Umm no, actually there are around 2^256 points on the ECC curve, which are mapped/hashed into 2^160 potential addresses.
So any specific address could be generated from one of 2^96 distinct points on the ECC curve, if the RIPEMD algorithm does a proper distributed mapping/hashing (which it probably does).
Try to think of addresses as safety-deposit boxes with a small trapdoor in the top. ALL 2^160 boxes already exist. It's just people havent found any of the right (private) key(s) to open each box yet - each box has 2^96 possible keys. You can still put money into a box through the trapdoor, but you can't open the box to get it out again without the key.

You pay by the byte, not by the value ... if memory serves, a 1 input, 1 output transaction is like 224 bytes. Thus the fee would be 1792 satoshis, or about 0.12 USD.
The point is, that fee would be the same whether you sent 1 dollar or 1 million dollars, thus the "save up to X percent" is deliberately misleading as it assumes a use-case that's unlikely to apply to most Bitcoin users.
Sending $1 via Bitcoin will cost you 12% for example.

@_date: 2015-06-17 06:34:55
Sorry, that's exactly how it works. You have a 1MB size limit on a block, and 144 blocks per day maximum. There's only so many transactions you can cram into one block (I believe the average is around 900 something right now) ... so what happens to the 901st transaction? Or the 9001st? It gets put in a queue and has to wait to be included in the next block.
The highest number of transactions EVER in one day was 133,000 ... do the math. 133,000 / 144 blocks = 923 transactions per block. That appears to have been on the date they did the stress test on the network ... you know the day when ALL confirmations were backed up for 8 hours.
Sure, that block might be solved in 5 seconds and hence all those txs are confirmed ... it's irrelevant if you're NOT IN that block but in the queue waiting to be included in the next one. That's 10 minutes you have to wait, no ifs or buts.
And notwithstanding the hard 7 tx/s limit, there's also some jiggery-pokery in the code about bandwidth speed that limits is practically to half that ... 3 1/2 tx/s.
Why do you think there's a civil war going on right now about increasing the block size limit? Because the system as is cannot cope.
Every 420 new users, even if they only do ONE transaction each in a day, adds 2 minutes onto the queue, and there's only a new block every 10 minutes ... so on average a 5th of those users will not be included in the current block, and have to wait at least 10 minutes to be confirmed ...
TL;DR; those of us who mock the concept appear to know more about how it works than it's defenders.

Any change to the proof of work algorithm would decimate it's value. You'd effectively be resetting the difficulty to 1 again.
There's direct correlations between price / difficulty / the amount of hardware purchased and electricty used. People only mine because the potential gain is slightly greater than the cost needed to mine. That's the inherent design of Bitcoin, to find an equilibrium.
You disenfranchise people who have millions or even billions invested in mining hardware, mining farms etc, by changing the PoW algorithm, and it's unclear if they'd be willing to make the same mistake again. Especially as with the drift towards ASICS, they cannot be repurposed.

Hur, dur, what a dumbass thinking a movie theater has 100 seats was pretty much the gist of your comment. When I pointed out examples that aren't EXACTLY 100, that's the best comeback you have?
You never answered how many seats you think a movie theatre DOES have ... I mean, obviously less than 100, right?


So wait, what you are NOW saying is that taking 2 minutes out to pay at the ticket desk with cash/card is MORE DIFFICULT than paying 30 minutes in advance and waiting for enough confirmations?


To be clear, the Bitcoin network aka the blockchain, can process at most 3 1/2 transactions per second.
Thats 210 a minute, 12,600 an hour, you do the math. Any serious adoption of Bitcoin cannot exceed these numbers, until they sort out the block size alteration etc in a few months.
These aren't numbers pulled out of my arse, these are HARD FACTS. Why do you think everyone is always talking about "sidechains"? Because the protocol as it is simply cannot handle volume transactions, and the only way to offset that is to use effectively more blockchains with a different name.
In a recent stress test, they hammered the network for 1 hour - it took 8 hours to clear the backlog!

Most DSL connections will be something like 3mb down and 512kb up if you are lucky. 512kbits/s = 64 kilobytes per second. (FYI DSL is defined as having a max up of about 7.1mb and a max down of about 1.1mb - any more than that, it's NOT DSL). 
6 blocks x 8 mb per hour = 48mb = 12.8 minutes.
This assumes you only ever maintain a 1:1 seed:peer (in torrent terms).

It doesn't have to. As I said, if just 0.4% of them, or 420 people, yes 420 people ONLY, across the whole of the US, avail of this service, it adds 2 minutes onto the blockchain transaction processing queue. And that effects *everyone* using bitcoin, not just those 420 buying movie tickets.
I don't know why this is so hard to understand. Every new user of bitcoin slows down the confirmation time for everyone else.
As I address your arguments, your responses promptly ignore them and focus on the most trivial thinks imaginable. First the fact that 8*12 is not equal to 100, and now the fact that I said 100% as an extreme example of the worst case outcome. 100% of 90000 people would add 8 hours onto the blockchain queue. That is FACT. Whether you like it or not.

So how is your javascript implementation better?
Bearing in mind the only sources of randomness I can see is a call to Date(), and a call to Math.Rand() which for all intents and purposes is based either on Date() or "time since process started" depending on which browser you're running on ... you might be getting up to 42 bits of entropy (32 bits date+time and maybe 10 bits for millisecond).
It seems your argument is that all programming languages are limited in scope to 32 / 64 bits depending on O/S and therefore that is the maximum amount of entropy the system can provide / work with ... and yet somehow by using javascript (which is running with the *same* OS limitations), you can magically get *more* entropy by munging it through various hashing and scrambling algorithms.
To get anything more, you'd need something like javascript monitoring mouse movements and asking the user to waggle his mouse while you collected sufficient samples to collect the entropy you need.
Date() and Math.Random() just aren't going to cut it by themselves.

As opposed to the bank, who will charge 15 EUR whether your transfer 1 EUR or 1,000,000 EUR.
You have a point, there is a sweetspot where BTC wins out over a regular bank transfer, but don't pretend it's the be-all and end-all of banks, because it's not.
Anthing over 750 EUR and the bank will still be cheaper than BTC. And within Europe, aren't bank transfers supposed to be free anyway?

The way you describe just makes the vendor the broker. 
Yes, it's cutting out a middle man, but the vendor is still going to add some % on to the goods he sells, if only to protect himself from the fact the goods he sold at 1 BTC when it was worth 600 US may only be worth 550 US at the end of the day when he comes to do his daily BTC to USD "cash out".
The scenario you describe assumes no conversion from BTC to fiat, something that is *never* going to happen. "Why?" you ask ... for the same reason there are still around 300 world currencies instead of us all using USD or EUR for our transactions.
Can we focus on the realities of Bitcoin, and not the pipe-dreams of romantics and fools?

Set an arbitrary price, and then claim it's a success because it's only dipped below that price on brief occasions.
It wasn't so long ago that $400 was the "psychological barrier", then $350, then $300 (oh, it will NEVER drop below $300), then $250, now $200 is your yardstick of "success".

Yes, in 2032 I believe, when the blockchain has as much capacity as Visa does today.


We already have a situation today where miners are rejecting transactions with fees they don't consider "big enough" (despite being told it couldn't happen) - picture the system 5 or 10 years down the line when mining rewards are so low they cannot cover the hardware costs (even if your electricity is free) - how big will the transaction fees be then?
And what more for the people who will make these cards, and operate the infrastructre to load them with value etc? They'll also incur a "fee" of some kind.
So while your questions are valid, the more obvious one is surely "why bother"?

So actually obtaining bitcoin and converting it back into fiat costs nothing?
There *is* a sweet spot where Bitcoin wins out over SWIFT, but that $20 transaction fee you mention applies whether you're sending $100 or $100,000.
Compare that to the *fixed* percentage you're paying to say Coinbase to buy bitcoins in the first place, and another *fixed* percentage when the recipient wants to sell those coins, and it quickly becomes apparent the "benefit" of bitcoins doesn't exist in all cases.
EDIT: Seems the sweetspot is $1000.
Assuming using Coinbase at both ends, 1% to buy bitcoin, 1% to sell bitcoin, when dealing with $1000 it would cost the same $20 as you would have paid to SWIFT. Anything over $1000, SWIFT becomes the better option right away.

As safe as the next zero-day exploit that the antivirus and antimalware teams haven't seen yet. So basically NOT safe at all.
No insurance, no comeback, no protection. How is this *better* than a credit card? Dont' get me wrong, bitcoin has potential.

You seem to assume that "miners" and "users" are two separate entities and never the twain shall meet.
When in fact, I'd argue that miners are the biggest users, i.e. they have to use the same blockchain to move around and spend the reward they mined i.e. every coin that exists on the network will initially be in the hands of the miners themselves!


You miss the point again. If 51% or more of miners are solving blocks on the forked code, any users on the original codebase will find their transaction times getting progressively worse and worse, until it's no longer practical to continue to use. Hence my original post.
The miners ultimately control everything about the blockchain, because they are the ones doing the work input to that chain. End users will either have to like it or lump it.

Exactly. And if they *all* decide to reject a transaction because a fee isn't considered high enough, it will never get processed. You can see it already with the two-tier system that exists now i.e. feeless transactions that get processed sometime before doomsday, and those with fees that get processed a lot faster.


No I'm predicting a scenario that requires at most 51% of miners to agree on a fork, and the other 49% will have to decide where their loyalties lie. Because that's all any fork to the codebase requires. It doesn't need rubber-stamping by Andreas or anyone at the Bitcoin Foundation. It can just happen with a consensus and someone to fork the code. That's it.
Is this just cognitive dissonance on your part, are or you just so devoted to the cause you won't consider any scenario that contradicts your world view?
Yes, I troll bitcoin, because you guys are so far up your own asses, you cannot see any further than the next bubble. That doesn't mean my points don't have *any* validity whatsoever. We've seen the two-tier system in action, it exists TODAY, despite the fact you just try to explain it away as if it doesn't.
You can no more predict the future than I can, miners are in the game solely (99.99%) to make money. They will do so by whatever means maximizes their ROI. And without the reward, they're not going to process zero-fee or "below threshold" fee transactions out of a sense of altruism of anything else. If it doesn't make commercial sense, it simply won't happen.

This is disingenuous BS and you know it. As mining is an integral part of the transaction mechanism, and one cannot exist without the other, fees ARE a part of the protocol.

To my mind, it's shouldn't be up to individual pools to voluntarily charge fees at all. That's not going to encourage pools to stay small, it encourages them to stay large, as they can cream off more from the miners work.
It needs to be built into the protocol at base level that the *reward* itself is on a sliding scale based on % of network.
25% or below, 50 coins.
25 - 37.5%, say 25 coins.
50%, 0 coins.
If there's no reward in mining for a pool that could damage the networks "trust", then the miners themselves will keep the network decentralized as a byproduct of seeking the best profit (which is why they are in the mining business in the first place).

Exactly ... a *very small* minority of people who were either lucky enough to buy in early or mined their own. But for people trying to enter today, their *only* option is converting from fiat, and then converting to fiat, because not everyone can survive on custom engraved bongs and the ONE restaurant in your town who happens to accept bitcoin.
Normal people have to pay taxes, they need to pay for medicine, hospital bills, car insurance ... all very necessary things for life that *cannot* yet be purchased (indeed will probably never be able to be purchased) in BTC. There will always be a need for fiat.
I have yet to hear one coherent argument about the benefits of Bitcoin that outweighs the benefit of a simple debit card, which already exists, and can be used anywhere.
Hence my comment about pipe-dreams. For BTC to succeed it needs to deal with it's problems in the market AS IS, not as some minority of idealists wish it was.

Thing is, the fee for conversion to/from Bitcoin/fiat is typically a fixed percentage. Meaning the larger the transaction, the more you get burned.
Whereas with banks, it's usually a flat fee for the transfer, regardless of the amount (and if you're transferring say within Europe), AFAIK there are no transaction fees whatsoever.
There is a sweet spot where Bitcoin beats regular Bank Transfer, but for larger amounts the bank still wins.

I did this exercise once before,and quite frankly, it's some scary big numbers in terms of the cost of the energy consumed.
The total hashing power of the Bitcoin network is around 18,000 THash/s today.
Assuming that every miner was using the latest energy efficient ASICs (patently *not* the case) that pumped out roughly 1 THash/s with an energy consumption of 750W, that means the total energy consumption of the network is 13.5 MW every hour, for a total of 9,882 MW every month. Enough to power around 11,000 typical US homes for the same period.
If we assumed that the energy cost was $0.10 per KWh (also very conservative), then the network is sucking up $988,200 every month.
There are an average of 400 transactions per block, and exactly 144 blocks per day, giving 4,392 blocks per month, or around 1,756,800 transactions per month.
So we can see each transaction costs (in terms of energy used) $0.5625 ... this is not to be confused with transaction charges, this is pure cost of energy used to confirm each transaction / solve each 1/400th of a block.
The problem is, as the number of blocks per day is fixed, but the difficulty keeps rising, it requires more and more THash/s i.e. more and more energy just to do exactly the same "work" on the blockchain.
So yes, I wonder how long it can be sustained ... as the number of blocks mined increases, the reward will halve more and more frequently until the cost to mine a block becomes prohibitively high for even high-end ASICs, in terms of energy consumed and the cost of said energy vs the actual block reward based on the value of the coin at that point.
Eventually it will become a zero-sum game, where the only way to profit will be to take massive amounts of hardware offline to allow the difficulty to literally fall, then jump back on to try and reap some benefit before it goes back up again.

I'm pretty sure they can. They already have the option of not accepting fee-less transactions, and they after all control the network. At some point in the future, when there's no reward to incentivize them, they will as a group demand a hard fork to implement exactly what is described i.e. the ability to accept / reject transactions based on a different threshold. And you as a bitcoin user will have no recourse but to suck it up and accept it.

So what is to stop them merely setting up TWO pools with neither having more than 26%?
Everything might appear hale and hearty, but they could collude with a combined power of 52% exactly the same as they've done before.
Kidology isn't going to solve this problem, the protocol itself needs some extra rules written in to avoid this ... deincentivising the reward perhaps based on the number of blocks you've already solved? So that occasional solvers get the full 50, regular solvers get half of that ... thus ensuring that larger pools are not as popular.
Faster rewards, more guarantee of solving, but not as much reward
Slower rewards, more luck involved, but a better reward
Moving people from pool A to pool B won't help one iota, if pool A &amp; B collude anyway.

I think you may need to read up on how Bitcoin actually works.

Sorry for sounding dumb, but I'd imagine most users will eventually want to consolidate those micro-payments scattered over N addresses into a common address than contains an amount that could actually be used to buy something or indeed cash out to a currency of your choice.
As you know at least one of the addresses i.e. the one you sent a micro-payment to, it would be trivial to monitor that address, and literally "follow the money". Once you see an obvious "aggregating" address with many micro-payments flowing into it, you still know all the transactions belonging to that individual.

Yeah I'm sorry, I just went on github and was browsing one of the js files. Apologies for jumping the gun.
However, if you are using mousemoves to collect entropy, is there any point in using Date() or Math.Random() at all? I mean, with all the privacy concerns about "backdoors" and faulty PRNGs, why bother using any source of entropy that *could* be predictable?
Also, when you collect the mouse coordinates, are you running the values through some Chi-squared thing to see if they are random enough, and if not, ask for some more waggles? Just a suggestion.

Unfortunately, for the 99.999% of us who don't or can't mine, conversion from fiat IS a mandatory step, whether you choose to admit it or not.
And right now, the only options are jump through hoops as described, or resort to local bitcoins at a 10-20% premium. Just for the dubious benefit of paying for stuff in Bitcoin online, which will invariably be converted back into fiat by the merchant at yet another premium.


How long are we going to trot out this tired meme as substitute for addressing the problems now? Unless it's as convenient as cash (forget ATMs, forget credit cards, forget money transfers), I'm talking about someone giving me a quid and me spending it before the universe explodes - it will never be a substitute for cash.

And this where we'll have to disagree.
The block reward is going to be halved ad infinitum (or at least until all 21 million coins are mined). However, the energy required to do the same work (solving the FIXED 144 blocks per day) keeps increasing.
Your assumption only works on the basis that every time the reward is halved, the price of bitcoins will automatically double to counter any profit losses for the miners. And the value of bitcoin is in it's investment potential and utility to buy and sell stuff, not just in the electricity cost used to mine it or the profits of the miners sustaining the network.

And what exactly would be the point?
All I hear here is the importance of bring new adopters on board, but a deathly silence when asked HOW they do that without going through the traditional channels (Coinbase and others) to convert fiat to Bitcoin.
Mining is basically no entry (and has been ever since the advent of ASICs and commercial mining operations). So those new adopters *have* to identify themselves to get Bitcoin in the first place. And due to the non-anonymous nature of things, those coins are linked to that user forever.
And as everyone knows, you have to give all your personal data to any of these exchanges to comply with banking regulations on money laundering.
So you have coins that are known to belong to a specific user, and you want to route them through TOR to what avail? Even after 7 server hops, transactions are still recorded on the same block chain and can be traced in the exact same manner as before.
This suggestion makes about as much sense as running Facebook through TOR because people are concerned someone might see their duck faces leering over plates of spaghetti carbona.

Philippine banks operate on a 50 Centavo buy/sell spread against the US Dollar.

Fine. Explain where I am wrong. Because if your meaning of "proof of holdings" is the same as mine, I assume you have to sign a message using your private key to prove you own a certain amount of bitcoins.
Whatever level that amount is will determine if a post is genuine or "spam" - an arbitrary figure that (like bitcoin fees) only work until someone decides it's in their interest to exceed that limit to assert themselves as genuine, and not "a spammer".
And then of course, when it turns out they *are* a spammer after all, your *only* solution will be of course to RAISE that arbitrary limit of yours. It will be a continuous game of cat and mouse.
Eventually, you reach a point where only those with money to burn can post, which is effectively paid advertising.

It's not "burning" it as such, but you seem to assume only "good actors" will have the necessary funds - which is simply not the case. Spam comes in all forms, not just from the little guy.
Take someone like Coinbase, or some gambling outfit, who will have massive reserves of Bitcoin. They are free to spam whatever they want on your forum, just by virtue of holding a lot of coins.


Exactly - but all you're succeeding in doing is setting a barrier to entry for new adopters who might well have many questions, but might not have the Bitcoins necessary to meet your "entry requirement" - while the big players can spam to their hearts content.

Back in the early 1980s this was actually a thing. A photodiode and associated hardware to detect whether a certain area of your TV screen was white or black, connected through a serial port to your PC.
You basically glued this photodiode to your TV screen with something like a Dalek sucker appendage, and while the TV program ran (something to encourage young people to get interested in computers), the top left corner of the screen would have this little square flashing black and white at about 0.125 bytes per second, and after 30 minutes, you'd have the equivalent of a "Hello World" program in your computer.

This is not always the case ... there's always a tendency to overfit the training set and arrive at a model that may fit to a high degree of accuracy but be worthless on the test set.
Most of the skill in data mining is being able to get a similar RMSE (or whatever measure of error you choose) on BOTH the train and test set ... that tells you the model is suitable and the degree of confidence can be stated in a more categorical way.
Asserting "85% accuracy" on the training set is meaningless, as there's no way to verify the test set.

Point multiplication on an elliptic curve is tricky to get your head round.
First of all, "multiplication" in this context means repeated doubling and/or addition of the generator G.
However, doubling and addition use complex formulas, which are done modulus a large prime number P.
So, you always start with the generator point G.
Public K = Private k * Generator G, so when k = 1, there's nothing to do, and K = G already.
If for example your private key k was 5, you'd be doing the following operations.
K = 1G (always start with this)
Double K, now K = 2G
Double K, now K = 4G
Add G to K, now K = 5G
Bear in mind that both K and G are effectively the x coordinates of points on the elliptic curve. The y coordinates can always be calculated from x using :-
y^2 = x^3 + 7
Doubling a point K, having coordinates x1,y1, to give a new point 2K having coordinates x2,y2
D = (3x1^2 + 7) / (2y1)
x2 = D^2 - 2*x1
y2 = D(x1 - x2) - y1
Adding a point G, having coordinates x1,y1 to a point K, having coordinates x2,y2, to give a new point K+G having coordinates x3,y3
D = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
x3 = D^2 - x1 - x2
y3 = D(x1 - x3) - y1
Remember that all operations are done modulus P, which is fixed at FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE FFFFFC2F
See here for more info.
 (the curve used in Bitcoin)
EDIT: I should mention, this is not something you can do on paper - but there are large number libraries available in many languages so you can experiment with these formulas.

He's split a known training set into two pieces, and is using cross-validation to say "if the model based on 85% accurately predicts the remaining 15%" then the model is good.
However, he doesn't know if that 15% accurately represents the actual amount of genuine accounts or sock-puppet accounts, as he doesn't HAVE that information.

I'm not sure if this algorithm still holds true :-
Transaction Size in Bytes = ((numberOfInputs*148)+(numberOfOutputs*34)+10)
Roughly speaking, the absolute best case is that each transaction has just 1 input and 1 output, which yields a transaction size of 192 bytes.
Each block is 1MB in size, and there's only one block every 10 minutes.
Simple math dictates you can only get a maximum of 5461 transactions in a block, hence 9.1 transactions per seconds.
However, almost no transactions will contain just 1 input and output. Most are going to have a change address output (i.e. 7.7 TPS), and some fair proportion of that are going to have more than 1 input.
This is the effect shown in those graphs ... each additional input reduces the overall TPS of the system.
Compression of the data won't work, and cryto addresses *should* by nature not be compressible ... if they were, you'd have much bigger problems.
No way around it, only way to increase the TPS is increase the block size, or allow more blocks than one every 10 minutes (possibly double the blocks, but half the reward).
But there's pros and cons to both solutions.

Nope, it's got damn all to do with the banking infrastructure. Our system already allows you to withdraw cash from pretty much any ATM in the country from *any* bank, and use that same ATM card as a debit card in pretty much any mall or shopping center in the country.
The lack of interest in banks is mostly due to the pitiful minimum wage meaning most people (escpecially outside the major cities) literally live week to week, from one paycheck to the next, and don't have a cent left over to put in a bank. People pay cash, because they know where they stand, and have been stung in the past by "dodgy banks" offering above market rate interest and then promptly going bust.
And as any savvy investor in the Philippine market should know, we are inherently aware of exchange rates, and will quite happily hodl our foreign currency until we see a favourable exchange rate. Not having 100% control on our money is a no-no, which is why I suspect bitcoin wil never make significant inroads into the remittance market.
No Filipino will risk seeing 5% or 10% of their money disappear overnight on a whim of the market - when you have so little, you demand absolute certainty - even if that means paying a fixed transfer fee, you know the $200 you sent will be $200 when it arrives, even if it cost you $10. And with so many different options for remittance, those fees are lowering all the time.
Not to mention our "padala" system which means sending money home with friends and relatives when they have a vacation ... which costs absolutely zero.
TL;DR; I cannot seeing it take off, not because of lack of infrastructure, but because Filipinos are Filipinos.

This is the thing, had you read my post completely. The official minimum wage in Manila is about 450 pesos / day, or about 11,250 a month. To open an ATM account is going to cost about 3,000 and you have to maintain that balance to keep the account open.
No one earning minimum wage can afford to sacrifice a weeks money simply to open an account, so they simply carry cash instead. To be absolutely honest, banking here is a convenience only - it's not essential to everyday life - it just saves carrying wads of cash around when you might get mugged. This isn't really applicable to the aforementioned minimum wagers, as they never *have* a big enough wad of cash to begin with.


This also was my point. Someone working in the mid-east will send home dollars, and then locally the recipient will hold onto them until the exchange rate to pesos if favourable.
With a bitcoin system, the remittance *might* be instant, and converted automatically from USD to PHP, but that's *not necessarily* what Filipinos want, as they lose control on when and where to exchange - even amongst the banks and money-changers, there's quite a bit of leverage between them - and it's one of our favorite pastimes to "play the system" and gain satisfaction from feeling like we got "a better deal" though our patience. Bitcoin takes all that away!
Still, we'll see how things pad out ... after all, I've only lived here 18 years, I probably know fuck all about the Filipino mentality.

Who says it hasn't been hacked? Any hacker worth his salt would realise that as soon as the hack was exposed, it would lose all it's value. Much better to utilize the hack to siphon small amounts of bitcoin off stale addresses so they wouldn't be noticed and bomb the price.
Of course to hack bitcoin, first you'd have to find a way to pair the ECC curve with it's quadratic twist and realise that the difference of the isomorphisms allow any point in the ECC curve to be represented by a difference of two points on it's twist, allowing you to run ECDLP on the smaller subgroups of the twist thus determining the private keys in sub-logarithmic time. *Or something like that*.

Okay, so it's a Sweepstake. You need to convince 100,000 people to stump up 20 bucks each, for a pot of $2,000,000. From that you pay out $1,200,000 in prizes, and presumably pocket the other $800,000.
However, that's all predicated on you selling 100,000 tickets at $20 each - your "freebie coupon" (now removed from the site) used up 27 tickets, so you only have 99,973 to sell. Until all are sold, the draw won't take place.
While it's a grand idea, it's not unique except in a few respects.
First, it uses Bitcoin, which means no traceability to who's holding the address. What's to stop you simply collecting $1,999,980 from people and then disappearing?
You have no phone number, and an address that tells nothing about who you guys are (Toronto, Canada is a mighty big place). Your domain name registration is likewise protected / anonymized. No financial accounts, no business registration, basically absolutely *zero* comeback or protection for those participating.
Not to mention I'm pretty sure you're already falling foul of the Canadian Contest Laws that require all sweepstakes to have a "no purchase necessary" entry option, amongst others.
It would be fantastic to take you on trust and believe this is a genuine endeavour, but you need to do a lot of work (a whole lot) before you're going to convince people to part with their money.
Good luck!

Bitcoin uses the secp256k1 curve. It's constants were selected in a predictable way, which significantly reduces the possibility that the curve's creator inserted any sort of backdoor into the curve.
The curve used in Dual ECDRBG had its parameters set by NIST with no explanation or justification *why* those were chosen. There is suspicion, but no proof (yet) that those particular combination of parameters may lead to backdoors or shortcuts in determining a Private Key from a Public Key.
Not relevant to Bitcoin in the slightest.

Umm yes, that's exactly how it works. That's the percentage that the miners get paid for *processing the transaction*. That cost has to come from somewhere, and is inherently built-in to the price of a Bitcoin.
Each 1BTC derives it's value from what people are willing to pay for it, already considering that between 1% and 2% of that value will be siphoned off by the miners for processing the thing. This isn't rocket science, it's basic economics.


If you want to guarantee a transaction gets processed in the very next block and within 35 minutes, the minimum you're paying (today) is 11 satoshis per byte, which for the smallest transaction of 224 bytes means 2464 satoshis or $0.23.
As of today, average transactions per block is 1116, and the average blocksize is 1062207 bytes, i.e. the average transaction size is NOT that 224 bytes minimum, but actually 952 bytes.
952 bytes x 11 satoshis per byte = $0.96 cents per transaction. 
NOT **"a few cents"** as you put it. Almost a dollar on average!

 charges $5 on amounts $500 - $999 i.e. between 0.5% and 1%.
How much is the typical Bitcoin transaction fee needed to actually get the same amount confirmed?
According to this, even at $0.06 / byte, you're talking a minimum of $13.44 for a single input and single output (224 bytes).
Hell, you'd need to be sending $10,000 or more before Bitcoin was cheaper than existing remittance methods.

As someone who has lived in the Philippines for 18 years, I can tell you that a DTI (Department of Trade and Industry) registration is as easy as choosing a name that no one else has registered, and paying the appropriate fee. That's it. Any fool can register a business name.
After that, you will usually be required to register with the BIR (Bureau of Income / Revenue?) if you are issuing receipts / doing any kind of money exchange in the Philippines.
This is because the government gets a cut on any foreign currency sent into the country, for example, any amount I send in US dollars to Philippines will usually incur a 0.25% "penalty" which gets deducted before it appears on my bank account.

Yes, on general principles I agree with you. By hypothetically, consider these two situations ...
1. Passwords are hashed with SHA 7500 rounds.
2. Passwords PLUS a random string based on say md5 of a record ID are hashed with SHA 7500 rounds.
Does exposing the fact that  uses a more complex input weaken the hashes? Of course it does! An attacker now has everything he needs to do a dictionary attack.
Having said that, anyone whos managed to root your server can analyze the code and understand what extra steps you are taking anyway. But on general principles, not exposing the method used to hash and what you are actually hashing is patently more secure than broadcasting the steps to the world in general.
In this case, ONLY the original attacker may know the exact steps ... and he's looking for a quick buck by selling the lists and letting someone else do the hard work (or indeed get absolutely nowhere with them). But for the site owner to come along and say "we lost all our password hashes, here is how they are constructed" is just idiotic. Now *everyone* knows how to attack the list.

No, it's a value for which I can feel confident that Bitcoin isn't just a flash-in-the-pan, and something that can maintain it's value during the non-bubble periods.
We had a long period around $50 then a bubble, after which it settled at $130. Then a second bubble to $1000+, which I feel was over-exagerated by some big investors buying in, making a mint, then cashing out.
If it settles at $250 and maintains that level for say a couple of weeks, I'll be happy to but in and play around with maybe a few thousand bucks, even if it's static for a year is irrelevant ... just that it won't suddenly drop to zero, and has the *potential* for another massive bubble in future. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 12:52:05
Why DO people just delete posts like this? FWIW, here's my reply, which has no context whatsoever now the scenarios have been deleted :-(
Where does the PRNG get its entropy from? Is it taking solely user input like that silly brainwallet did (exposing addresses to common dictionary attacks), or using random values based on system time, or a combination of these and other sources?
Public + private keys generated from the ECC curve don't have "collisions as such", what this post would seem to imply is that the bitcoin address derived from the hash of public key was identical to another one already in existence.
This in itself is quite possible ... you're taking essentially a random 2^256 bit value and hashing it into a 2^160 address space ... every single address can have 2^96 potential collisions where *different* public keys could hash to the same address.
Unlikely? Yes. Impossible? Nope.
Scenarios listed, I'd still say (a) is most likely, then (b), (d), (e), (g) and leave the conspiracy-theory tinfoil-hat NSA spying on us ones at the end i.e. (c) and (f).

They don't need to "break" the hash algorithm ... they simply run the traditional dictionary attacks and wordlists using the same hashing algorithm, and compare with those on the list ... kindly supplied in full detail by the idiot who runs the website.
Not that it would have mattered in this case, seeing as the signature string "$5$rounds=7500$" is conveniently saved as part of the hash. That combined with the length of the hash and a basic knowledge of the outputs of various PHP hashing algorithms would have been enough.

I mentioned this on another thread ... I don't think they *are* trying to prevent themselves from losing money. I think they are buying the bitcoins, and if it's undergoing an upward trend they sit on them for 5 to 7 days, sell them at the higher rate, and then pocket the difference after refunding your original dollar value.
And if the bitcoin price is stable or on a downward trend, they just release the coins to you after that same period, incurring no loss to themselves as they'd already bought them at "zero-day" at the rate quoted.
Either way they win. They either pocket the potential gains that should have belonged to the client, or alternatively lose nothing by passing any losses on to the client also.
It's happening *way* too often now that well established traders are suddenly "high risk" and losing all the potential gains.

Your perception may be somewhat blinkered by your libertarian leanings. I'd invite you to explain *why* you think it is broken?
It has had an 18 day hiccup ... it's not been the first time, and it won't be the last. If the GOP hadn't been playing blackmail games with the country, this would never have happened. The only thing that is broken is the two party system and the ability of various branches of the legislature to pull shit like this in the first place. This time it was (R) fucking (D), next time it will be (D) fucking (R). Perhaps the answer lies with the people, in insisting this clusterfuck needs to be remedied so it can't happen again?
The NSA spying has caused an outrage, but the US isn't the only country doing this by a long chalk. Does that imply that the UK, Australia, New Zealand and most of Europe are also "broken"? Not to mention the possible majority of US citizens who actually seem to be okay with it.
Apart from that, it seems like business as usual. One of the best indicators of the confidence in a country is the exchange rate. Over the last two years, the EUR &lt;-&gt; USD rate trend has been a flatline of 0.779. Sure it fluctuates in response to bad (and good) policies, bad (and good) international decisions, the government being effectively dead for 18 days etc - but it bounces back.
There is nothing to indicate that the USD is going to crash and burn now, anymore than there was in 1978 or 1996.
Libertarianism does have some strong arguments, but in combination with bitcoin discussions, the tendency to hyperbole is rife, as you've demonstrated here.

Because they are designed to run SHA256(SHA256(input)) on whatever input it's given, and designed to look for a result with N leading zeros.

But in the real world, bug-free software simply does not exist. Hell, only a few months ago there was that Unicode rendering bug that bricked iPhones email system.

So I take it you don't understand how OpenID works? It is designed using crypto techniques to avoid having to trust a further 3rd party with your email, password, username or other credentials. What better demonstration of crypto is there than that?
The point is, there is enough spam on the internet already. Whether you use your regular email address, or make a dummy one just for this purpose is irrelevant. Unless you are intending to either send spam to that email address, or sell it to a 3rd party for profit, you do not need it!
Every single day, there are servers getting hacked, and peoples email addresses and passwords exposed to the world ... Adobe just lost 2.3 million the other day. Minimizing the use of emails and passwords as a login mechanism mitigates the possibility that users will be exposed if they used those credentials on other websites.

If the only way to obtain bitcoins was mining, then I'd agree with you. But the barrier to entry has become so high now, the only way for mainstream acceptance and purchase is to buy it using other currencies.
That process *has* a paper trail, whether you choose to admit it or not. Wire transfers, credit cards, currency exchanges (online or offline), hell even Western Union are all legally required to have traceable records of who purchased what and when.
If it can be shown that you exchanged another currency for bitcoins, you might find yourself getting hit by the Inland Revenue (or equivalent in your country), should you fail to declare those profits. Also, if it can be demonstrated that you deliberately obfuscate the process by laundering bitcoins in one way or another, you might even get hit with money laundering charges.
Alternatively you could just bury your head in the sand, that's another option I guess ...

If P == NP then it simply means there is a polynomial-time solution to every problem. However, "polynomial-time" simply refers to something faster than exponential (someone correct me if I'm wrong here) ...
So let's say we have a problem (any problem) that might take longer than the length of the universe to solve (i.e. brute-forcing SHA256) and call it "exponential" ... a polynomial time solution might be *faster* than exponential but only take HALF the length of the universe to solve. That still really doesn't help us.
A polynomial solution doesn't guarantee a problem can be solved withing a timeframe we can recognize, it merely means that a polynomial solution will be faster than the current exponential solution.

While you could theoretically generate random points on the ecc curve and hash them at thousands or even millions per second
1. You have to query the blockchain for each one to see if it has a balance, no small feat with ddos protections, proxy detections etc.
2. Even generating say 1 milion addresses per second, 86 billion a day, 24 trlllion a year, thats still only around 2^45 ish ... a tiny fraction of 2^128. Even after 13 billon years (the age of the universe) youd still only be on 2^64.

This. Many people have a vested interest in mining hardware already, and have yet to see a positive ROI. A bitcoin at $1 would obviously see a massive decline in the use of mining hardware until the difficulty came down, at which point they'd resume and the price would climb again.
Remember, at $1 per coin, it only needs to go to $2 to see a 100% gain on your investment, and if it bombs, you've only lost $1. At $600 per coin, it needs to go to $1200 to see the same percentage return, and likewise you could lose $600 if it bombs. I know which scenario I'd choose to buy in at.

One instance of RSA-768 was broken in 2009, however it took 3 years and around 250 CPUs. It was estimated that RSA-1024 could be broken with 1000 times more computational power, and considering Moores Law, I'd say you'd be looking at 3 years with (250 x 1000) / 2 / 2 = 62,500 CPUs ... or you could trade time for CPUs as the main part (sieving) is massively parallel ... so maybe 250,000 CPUs running for 9 months ... or 1,500,000 CPUs running for 45 days etc etc ...
Just back of the envelope calculations you understand. The biggest problem for larger RSA values is the amount of physical memory you need to have to solve the final very large sparse matrix step. RSA-768 needed 4TB I believe.
Yes, it *could* be done ... but you'd need to repurpose a shitload of CPUs and memory for the sieving step.
I should clarify this is the *only* effective way to break RSA (i.e. using the General Number Field Sieve), it cannot be "bruteforced" unless you have more time available than the age of the universe.

Been there, tried that. It is possible to describe the entire algorithm in terms of an algebraic equation where each variable represents one bit, but the number of variables needed and combinatorial explosion that happens even over the course of one round, means the final equation to generate a collision with certain properties (N leading bits are 0) requires the solving of 1 equation with 512 unknowns. Which simply cannot be done.
You might find a weakness that determines the probability of a certain bit being a certain value that isn't 0.5 which gives you a slight edge ... but even then, you're probably only reducing the search space from 2^256 to maybe 2^(something slightly less than 256) ... so not that much help
Having said that, I'm pretty sure that the chance of a collision in the public key -&gt; address stage (SHA256 followed by RIPEMD-160) is a better attack vector.
There are 2^96 possible collisions for each address. Finding a collision *might* be doable with enough hardware and time.

In the response, while I mostly agree, his response to number 8 is complete nonsense.
"It removes the credit card fraud risk – once bitcoins have been received and confirmed a sufficient number of times, they are yours."
No, it doesn't *remove* the risk, it just shifts it all onto the buyer instead of the seller. You can purchase anything you like, but once the bitcoins are transferred to the seller, you have NO legal protections, and no way to recover your losses if the seller doesn't actually supply the goods.
So please, let's not pretend the system is perfect ... it's close, but no cigar. I'd really like so see some Escrow type services, but that in itself is fraught with exactly the same dangers i.e. how can you trust the Escrow service currently holding your coins not to just walk away with them.
Basically, the whole architecture allows more and more elaborate Ponzi schemes, be it pre-order mining rigs that take so long to deliver, they are redundant once they arrive, to any number of intermediary wallets, double or nothing gambling, and commission based "services" that involve you giving your bitcoins to unknown entities basically "on trust" or by word of mouth reputations.

Yes, but it's not a brute force against a 256 bit public key, it's a brute force against an 160 bit hash of that public key.
Each public key can potentially map to 2^96 valid addresses, but you'd still need to test 2^160 private + public key pairs, and the hashes generated before guaranteeing a hit. It's still a monstrous number, but not quite as big as the number of atoms in the universe.

You seem to be missing my point. If you have to convert to / from any currency, then it defeats the purpose of bitcoin. Do you think that person who sold a car for bitcoin will then use them at that ONE pizza outlet in their state who accepts it? Or maybe order a Porsches worth of Royal Jelly / Ginseng / [insert-other-homeopathic-bunkum-here] online with bitcoins? Hell no, they'll just wait for the right time and convert it back to USD.
Until it is accepted INSTEAD of cash / credit anywhere and everywhere, it's nothing more than a speculation vehicle. Once I can get paid in bitcoin, pay my bills in bitcoin, eat using bitcoin, buy shit in a convenience store with bitcoin, without ANY conversion to USD / GBP / EUR or whatever, it'll only ever be an investment opportunity.

Which brainwallet does already, and has been demonstrated to provide NO obstacle whatsoever to people employing dictionary attacks.
Adding one more *known* step into an algorithm does not detract from the fact that the original passphrase is still too weak. A user determined random number of SHA 256 hashes might be slightly better, but again, humans are also useless at picking random numbers.
Ask anyone to think of a number between 1 and 10, and you will get statistically more people picking 7 than anything else.
And the more you try to make the passphrase longer and more complicated, the easier it becomes to forget.
There is no easy answer to this problem.

The task is extracting the maximum amount of milk with the minimum amount of moo - Lord Vetinari.
Thing is, if you believe the anarchists amongst us, everything will be okay, and we'll rely on altruistic people to pot into the pot on a "as-needed" basis.
Unfortunately, as governments know, and anarchists seem to forget, human beings are generally selfish bastards, and while they might chip-in once in a while, when they're asked to donate to this soup-kitchen and that disaster and those sick people over there and thirty other needy causes a week, they'll soon resist it and fall back on the "I've got mine, fuck you mentality" that they currently condemn the 1% for.
And at that point society falls apart. Yes, we need the IRS for the simple fact that without it, people simply would not contribute enough to maintain the society. Now you can argue all you want about unnecessary wars and making savings on traditional government, sure there are savings to be made. But at the end of the day, who decides what's a "worthy cause", if not just another self-appointed bunch of governers ? And what happens to the non-worthy ones ?
Are you going to make all your decisions by referendum, or concensus ? How does that accommodate minority viewpoints ? Or indeed anyone who doesn't mine bitcoins ? Basically, if you remove the current government, you'll merely end up replacing it with something worse ... invariably a dictatorship, where an even SMALLER group of elites (compared with the current system where we can change them aroudn every 4 years) make all the decisions. And we all know how well those work out.
TL;DR; IRS takes money by force because humans are inherently greedy, despite a few altruistic exceptions.

No less than 3 "trusted" websites have been "hacked" in the past couple of months, and apparently there is no recourse possible to anyone who lost money or sensitive passwords etc. Seems people are far too trusting, and rely on word of mouth way too much, which in these days of astroturfing and proxies, are all too easy to fake. While not a Ponzi in itself, the methodology is remarkably similar.

If I could just address your points with an open mind as opposed to an obvious bias.


Instead of "no control" except a majority concensus (currently by one or two mining pools who if colluded, could determine the entire future of the currency overnight). How is this different than banks colluding on LIBOR rates?


As opposed to being easily hacked. if you haven't been paying attention, millions of bitcoins have simply "vanished" due to hacking (or site owners simply deciding that disappearing is more profitable than staying online).
3) It is likely a scam since if it were popular, it's creators could just mint more bitcoins to defraud us all.
I guess you weren't paying attention as to how many millions of Bitcoins were mined by the first early adopters.


As opposed to it's value being determined solely by buy/sell ratios, and the ease in which you can convert Bitcoins to fiat and vice-versa (incredibly difficult and a major stumbling point - and if you quote "local bitcoins" it will go very badly for you - I live on 1 of 7,000 islands in the Philippines ... who *exactly* is "local" to me ???). Don't kid yourself, right now Bitcoin is a speculative tool for the vast majority who are priviledges enough to live in societies with instant banking and minor hassles getting "verified as 'NOT-A-TERRORIST-TRANSFERRING-FUNDS".


If the creators of any bitcoin website go out of business or indeed the blockchain itself is compromised, there is NO COMEBACK WHATSOEVER. Hell, even banks insure you for the first 50 grand!
Clearly the idiot who wrote this piece either is deluding themselves that Bitcoin is anything other than a vehicle for speculation, or doesn't understand Pyramid Schemes i.e. the value is bolstered by many new investors joing, while older investors "cash-out" at inflated prices for minimal initial investment ... 13 cents to 1,000 dollars etc ... THINK, who profited the most, and how high were they in the pyramid?
While I expect to be downvoted by the "zealots", anyone with half a grain of common sense will think twice. Bitcoin is not cut-and-dried, not by a long, long way.

I believe that if you find a polynomial time solution to the factorization problem (ala RSA), then you can also rework that solution and apply it to modular elliptic curves (the thing ECDSA uses).
We know there are already polynomial time solutions to RSA, but the best to date was RSA768 (bits), and that took almost 3 years on hundreds of PCs. To scale up to RSA1024 (bits) would take around 1000 times more resources, and possibly half the time (Moores Law).
A 1024 bit RSA would be the equivalent to a 256 bit Elliptic Curve ... so I think cracking an ECDSA key i.e. getting the Private Key given the Public Key, might already be possible, but it would take a shit ton of resources and energy.
