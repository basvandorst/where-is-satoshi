At the bitcoin halving in july of 2016 the value of a bitcoin was about $450. Experts predicted that bitcoin would hit $1000 by the end of the year and would even go up as high as $5000 to $10000 in the next 4 years. So far they have been right in their prediction. I've been mining bitcoin since april 2016 and I have acquired a good amount of bitcoins. Since I've been involved in bitcoins I have grown significantly financially. There is currently a new bitcoin trend that has taken the bitcoin community by storm and it's also growing rapidly and this trend requires a very small investment on your part and starts as little as little as 0.0001 ($0.12 current rate). So far this is the best and easiest way that I have earned bitcoins. If you want to know more about this PM me.

You are entitled to your opinion and I respect that. But may I ask you one thing, have you ever participated in one of the programs? Because  if you had you would sing a different tone. Standing on the fence and screaming "Don't believe him guys, it's designed to take all your BTC" is the best way to proof yourself a failure. Keep doing what you've been doing and I'll do the same which is making money. Everyone else who wants proof that I'm earning bitcoins for real may contact me. And FYI I make my website on wix because I also earn money from that.

This is the only subreddit I have used for this and you are the only one that responded publicly about my threat all other responses are PM's so I don't know what your talking about spamming. That is not even allowed here and I was only replying to an existing threat. So yes be honest and please don't spread rumors.

Like I said before I respect your opinion and if your comment was based on facts I would even consider quiting the program. But I did my due diligent and I'm earning bitcoins with the program and because of that I will always defend my position. I understand you're being cautious, so am I being 15 years in the online business.
