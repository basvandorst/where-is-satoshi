I love that someone as misinformed as you is going around doomsaying. You could not have proved more thoroughly that you have no idea what you're talking about.

Believe what you want. Crypto of every variety has had ups and downs and will continue to do so. If the basis for your mindless panic is a one day dip in prices I don't know what to tell you. Even now the price is well above the all time high from six weeks ago.
Crypto has and will continue to have a huge impact on the tech sector, and despite your shortsightedness the world marketplace is already slowly altering course because of this phenomenon.
Whether you believe me is irrelevant. Bitcoin may succeed or fail, as may any other individual token, but this bell can't be unrung. Cryptocurrency will be a big part of our future.

I just want to thank you for boosting my confidence even further, if someone as dumb as you was proselytize for crypto I would be concerned about it's future.

I'm not saying you're wrong necessarily, here or elsewhere, but I would be very careful with this fervorous mentality that there is no such thing as bad news for Bitcoin. Thinking like that is a good way to lose all your money.

It's because saying "it's a bubble it's a bubble it's a bubble" and then yelling "I knew it!" every time the price dips is not adding anything of value to the conversation.
The price has gone up, and it's gone down. Sometimes drastically, in both directions. No one really knows how high it could go, or whether Bitcoin will be dead by this time next year. It's all blind speculation.
But as of right now, all the people shouting that it's a bubble have yet to be proven right. Current price is still above the all-time high from six weeks ago. Maybe Bitcoin will die, but it's not dead yet, and acting like you've been vindicated because of a price dip is hilariously stupid.

I can't help but laugh at people saying anything and everything is "good for bitcoin" no matter how disastrous it may be, but I have to admit, seeing BTC bottom out at 13000 was definitely a big confidence boost. The korean ban rumor was very bad news yet the lowest dip was a month-old all-time high and we rebounded off it almost instantly.

And now dropping down to *only* 9.5k is an absolute catastrophe and "the end of bitcoin."
