Such a great point. Everyone looking at futures for visibility into the cash. When really its only a fraction of the volume.

Yes easy to HODL when its unleveraged, investment as part of my portfolio. I actually dont care what the price is day to day. I buy the same amount every week at the same time. I put zero effort. Whil that prolly has hurt me a few percent here and there. Its stressfree and i go about my life...
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:34:14
Unfortunately u wouldnt understand if i told u. As a professional trader for 20 years and a member of the CME. This thing is going to launch when futures get listed. Brings a whole.new level of investor to the table. Theres not enuff btc in circulation to satiate this appetite.

700 bill by 2019? It will be 1.4 tril at leas by jan 1 2019. If it was only 700 bil i would seriously consider getting out.

Agree but that price is a long way from here.

Why i put my paycheck every month into btc then sell pieces for spending. Then leave the rest. It changes the whole mindset. USD is worthless in the future. Moar deficits moar borrowing etc.

Nobody has to win. BTC is digital gold. Get mad if u want but the reaaon the price is soaring. Is cause people hoard it. Same as gold on bitcoin is actually a scarce resource. Its not PayPal (even if thats what it was intended to be) and people dont buy PayPal stok and hoard it cause i can send someone rent money. ETH is totally different in the use of smart contracts. Does it have a digital value store yes. Will people HODL it for spec reasons sure. But in my mind not even competing for the same dollar as BTC. Both will go up forever due to the resource being scarce and hoarding and the ability to sell bitcoin in fractions. As ive said before btc is worth either infinity (assuming the TOM Foolery of central banks. Or nothing. If it was just a payment network it wouldnt be worth 4.5k a fukn coin. There is no in between...
@_date: 2017-08-31 04:00:57
Why would u ever use btc to spend to buy daily things. It goes up in value forever. The complete opposite of FIAT. Cause inflation is far lower. Use ur stupid paper money for the shit u buy everyday.
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:47:24
Safe to say they are not thinkin. I sold mine for .14 then woke up sik when it traded .48 i resisted the urge to buy it. Thank god. Then it went doen to .25 and i had to buy on bittrex. Just in case it went back to 1400. Them i realized it was free on hitbtc and liqui. So i dumped on bittrex and bought it over there. Noq cant figure out the other part of the trade. Cause i cant send it back to bittrex. Lol.
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:00:01
It was over 1k btc bidding at 5% i lent some at 4.99% only for 12 hours tho.
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:41:47
It traded 100 mil on bittrex???
@_date: 2017-08-31 04:44:19
I did the same late may. Boughtfor the first time at 2.7k then 2.5k then 2.1k then went to 1.7k felt like an asshole. Now i dont feel stupid. I buy 500$ bux everyweek. Many will do the same. Beats the fuk outta investing in my 401k. But then again most people one here dont even know what that is.
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:50:02
I sold at that price 24 hours ago. 8 hours ago i was so upset. Now realize my genius. Lol
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:58:25
Serious question why has it traded 100 mil to the upside on bittrex if its such a scam. I dumped mine yesterday had my coins at bittrex for this. Then watched it go up 600 per from where i sold in 12 hours and thought. Im the dumbest mfer on earth. And everyone that is calling me still figuring our how to get theres off breadwallet is fukn rich?
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:59:40
Yah my end goal isnt to support myself into retirement its to preserve the purchasing power of the money i have now. And i believe BTC is best situated for that vs gold.
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:45:20
I bought in at the ATH at 2700 ish in may. Then it crashed and i bought moar. And moar and moar. Its always the ATH or its going to zero. So who cares! MOAR!!!
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:50:11
And that is coming fast. CME will introduce a whole new class of institutional money that wants to bet on price without risk of losing coins. 50-70k by end of 2018. Who knows beyond that. Higher price actually equates to lower volatility.

how can they run a node without the miners? dont they need the antminers to run the node? I realized i am going to get downvoted for this idiotic question. Im not new here.

They could easily sell it in the OTC market. Granted it would be at a discount say 10-25% but cumberlandmining would prolly take at least half.

Thats factually untrue. I know several gpu miners 200 or bigger. And they set all their settings and specifics to gpus tweaking each card to maximize a specific coin. Different coins like different settings. The switching algos are for hobby miners that just want to make money with a workstation while not using it or gaming.
Its way to risky from an uptime perspective to switch coins. Mining rigs are like women. They purr along and everything is going great until u touch em, get near em, or shake the loor around them then they break. And its endless hours of 'troubleshooting' and like women there is no guarantee that worked the last time will worl this time.

Such great points. its either going to zero or worth unlimited, and if it ever gets institutional money. its going to a bajillion. i've been sayin since 2013 buy bitcoin, sell gold. now is no diff. dip is great i just buy moar everyweek.
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:54:35
what does  stand for?
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:33:06
I agree with this. but that will happen overtime. eventually as markets mature they stabilize, this happens with any new trading vehicle. i have traded many new emerging markets nat gas, feeder cattle etc. and as the products mature, the volatility tends to decrease except for supply and demand shocks. 
TL;DR i sold two gpus for $900 dude paid in btc 4 hours later he had paid 990. 2 weeks later he only paid $670ish

yes COINBASE is terrible, but no other way to send fiat to buy bitcoin or anything else then have to transfer to that dumpsterfire polo or bittrex. wait til this gets easier for soccermoms to buy. then it'll get really fun.
@_date: 2017-06-04 21:42:11
Too your point. im trying to buy a bunch of these ALT coins for the explicit purpose of taking one to the moon. My number is so stupid. i wouldn't sell it exchange it or do anything with it. i will just hoard it. Everyone has a price, that's what makes a market. but to spend BTC then replace with FIAT doesn't make anysense given the fees. im in a sitch where i can't get enuff money to the exchange to buy all the coins i want at once.

@_date: 2017-06-06 22:55:23
Good for you. I buy a lil everyday cause i can't send money to exchange fast enuff. I just keep buying the ATH cause  its going to a bajillion. if it goes down i will just buy MOAR and MOAR AND MOOOOOAOOARRRR!!! finite supply unknown demand equals see you on the MOON! i bought my first BTC last week. This isn't even close to topping. Think of it as a store of wealth and there are only 16.5 million banks and all the money in the world wants to go there or at least the 4.6 trillion in gold right now. and in order to get in this bank you need to buy out someone elses right. That puts each bitcoin at about 278k buks (ish) of course another technology could come along or a better coin or whatever. but in the meantime a long way to go from here.
Congrats on your sale. FreeRollin now. Great trade.
@_date: 2017-06-04 21:38:57
Everyone keeps talking about a bubble. Great logik in this thread totally agree. BTC will keep going up based on people moving money outta bullshit assets into this or other coins. market cap of COINS is 90 Bil. Someone HOLD MY BEER.. that is absolutely a fly on the wall. what if apple bought BTC with the 58 bil they are holding in cash offshore, and then transferred it back on their balance sheet? Point is no one knows, and the potential is enormous. this isn't even mainstream to people with money yet. Just chinese people trying to get their money outta the country. wait til it goes mainstream in the US... price of BTC or ETH or something else will be recok. Don't let anyone tell you its a bubble. Its a bubble when no one sees it coming.
@_date: 2017-06-11 15:08:35
This is an excellent post and I have suspected this. for example if polo is charging 15 to 25 basis points per trade and they have millions of dollars of executions how are they not making all the money? if they did 300 mil in volume in ETH yesterday thats 450k in fees and they can't answer a support ticket? and have closed the trollbox to focus on support? somethings amiss
