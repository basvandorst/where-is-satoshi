Not a physics major but have seen high tension cables snap before. If the tension numbers are correct above, the backup cable won't matter much. The snapping cable would likely slice through the passenger like butter as it recoiled.
But let's assume the passenger survives that by some stroke of luck. It's highly likely that either the snapped cable is going to jam the pulley mechanism that the rider is attached to, or worse... The weight now resting on one cable causes that cable to sag and the rider, now lower than expected, no longer line up with the clearing in the trees...

I'm probably going to get a lot of hate for being Coinbase user seeing that there is a general dislike of them around here. We'll chalk it up to being young and naive (or something like that). But I'm now kicking myself. I had a reminder on my calendar a week ago to pull my BTC out [of cointbase] because I feared something like this would happen around the end of the month and unfortunately life got in the way and it looks like I'll be lucky if my coins transfer to my wallet before the first of the month.
Needless to say, I'm not going back to Coinbase once all my funds are pulled and I'll be on the hunt for a new exchange.

fwiw, I've got them showing up "unconfirmed" in my wallet now. If my understanding is correct, this means they've been processed on the Coinbase side and it's now up to the network to sort things out.

Not sure if trolling or serious here. If they hold the private key of a wallet and the chain forks then coins valid of BCC are effectively duplicate of the BTC chain. By not giving you access to the BCC they are pocketing them, plain and simple.
