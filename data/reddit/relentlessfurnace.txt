Oh I know what if friken means. Instead of going on a great road trip/tornado chase down in the states in May I have to scrap what would be the 1 last trip to the "land of the free". Because once weed is legal here, they might as well close the 49th. When I look at the charts I don't see a major reset being quick. This one likely lasting 6 months. By then its far too late for us canucks to go visit the states. Eh

Major roads only? or is it like a national border where you can't take a backroad?

People like you and everyone need to be educated. but i know without a doubt people are stupid. They don't have checkpoints at state lines, what's to stop idiots. But it's my fear regarding People thinking "legal on both sides, lets bring it over" mentality. I heard the USA customs won't even let you in at all if to use weed. This is because Customs/dept of homeland security is a federal agency and holds to the very strict old ways. After July 2018 the most common questions asked by the guard will be "do you smoke weed" "have you smoked weed" "do you have weed". While My health prevents me for even considering the stuff I know it will cause major delays. And at some crossings long enough to have to spend the night. I could fly to Australia in the time it takes to drive from Calgary to Great Falls.

But but but. If it's like July then It won't be testing new highs for 6 months(July again). But Canada makes Pot legal in July. The Canada/USA border will become a traffic jam. NO NO NO I want to go BEFORE and my crypto is my gas money. I hate the idea of spending the night at the border because 10 idiots in front of me took their weed with them. Spring USA or bust

It's not the state law. The federal Law that applies to all ports of Entry. And it is a lack of you knowing that is why I genuinely believe the USA/CAN border will be a gong show for years after July 2018

Downvoting because of opinion? That's why I name call. Why do i even bother make any points because there is always someone who fucks up the whole day. PS I worked for a few months in the stock market looking for stocks and reading charts so I KNOW their fees and requirements. Crypto is peanuts in comparison. A word of warning, I take names for my big bag of dirt. Screenshots and such. After being criminally defamed on twitter over my opinion of El Nino I take shit seriously online now.

Bitcoin is the only thing that does not require a minimum amount to purchase. Money made trading is mostly between altcoins(much like how real money is traded).
   
Becuse of this even the impoverished can get BTC and use it. And also trade it with altcoins to grow it. Sadly the current market has caught up with me, dropping faster than my profit and has today Crossed over into the NEGITIVE for the first time. Should have traded using Tether :(. Im trying to get about 50-70 percent profit(I was up as much as 3 times) so I can buy my new pc upgrade(newegg now takes bitcoin in Canada!). A stable price would be better. It has dropped so god damn fast that someone in Africa could buy BTC at 9k and head down the road only to find out it's 6900 and be unable to afford the thing he got the BTC to use on. It is still too unstable to be usefull for that.

Well for one your continuing to respond with heavily negative feedback and using very clever insults. I don't have to be paranoid to think that your the one who put that single - on my post. Tbh the last part of your comment gave you away.
By the way you ever thought about charities who operate in Africa using Bitcoin instead of getting hosed by Fiat banks. I should probably mention those guys right?

If the recent 2017/2018 bubble is the same played out as the one in 2013/14 I STILL see $500,000 by that time. Who said Bitcoin(or really anything) moves in a predictable fashion. This time around it is happening faster. If we got a 2013 repeat with more speed, then it entails we go down to $3500 for a few weeks at the bottom(maybe in the fall) and spend most of the rest of 2018 and part of 2019 between 5k and 15k. Toward the end of 2019 beginning of 2020 were at about 30-40k. and similar to 2017 there is a surge during 2020. That brings us potentially as high at $650,000. So based on that it would come down to the wire for the old man's dick.

Okay okay dickhead. Almost no minimum.
Go pay the $10,000 minimum investment for a stock market broker! I'll stick to my sub $1000 equipment to buy BTC. Oh and have fun with that 15% penalty for your western union and such. And those 10% broker fees per trade                        
Laptop or phone: $200             
Electricity(for device):$10/month or $100 for a solar panel.         
Transfer fee(current): Under 10 bucks             
Data plan: $30/mo          
Sorry for saying no min when it's 1% of the min to buy stocks or send fiat!

Banks only get their power because they owe each other astronomical amounts of money. All it takes is a few more housing bubbles to pop and the whole facade comes falling down.
Canada is next in line. The libs and Provinces like BC killing the jobs while pumping up the mortgage bubble at the same time. It won't end well for the banks

LOL only regret is not getting bitcoin when I WANTED to lol. Took a couple months to get all set up with exchanges. That 2 months was from mid Oct to mid Dec. Delays cost large sums.
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:34:29
i recall saying 5k on the zclassic subreddit. I was closer lol, Now we make our way to the next peak thus summer. Gonna be a hot one.

This is all part of the plot to make the rich richer, and the poor poorer. Bitcoin has some of the lowest entry cost of any volatile investment. Lets compare what you can do with $300.       
         
Massive gains or losses in Crypto: YES!!! 
          
Gains/Losses in Stock market: NO!!! Even if you could  
you's lose most of it in fees.   
           
Real estate: You joking right? Not gonna happen. 
      
Gold, silver: Yes, it's easier to buy real gold in your hands though.        
             
Savings, low risk stuff: Sort of. Your gains won't surpass inflation and if you would be lucky to double that before you die, Even if you invested in your 20s.   
              
If someone were to put that $300 into crypto and hodl to the next big bubble thou could easily turn it into several thousand. Over a 3 year wait(like 2014-2017) that is still 400-800 percent per year. The fact you could take a couple hundred bucks and turn a profit with it is what makes this new market so tantalizing. I can hone my skills with peanuts before every putting any serious money on the table. Sure AF can't do that with the stock market.

Well the "million dollar BTC bubble" is yet to come.
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:39:39
Lol, and in a place where the current system does the most damage. Students with peanuts and scary 5 and 6 figure debt amounts hardly care about the current system. The current fiat system grows with debt, the more you owe, the more your worth in interest.

Sadly me too. Blame the Canadian banks. I was all set up in October 2017 but it took until damn near Christmas before I was able to get any fiat into my accounts to buy bitcoin(I ended up buying with Flexepins I get at a local Chinese eats/store establishment). To be honest I have all the right to rob that damn bank. Had it gone my way I would have bought at the same price as today but BEFORE the run up to 20k. Knowing it's resistance I would have sold at 20k. I might have lost a bit in the new year's bear trap. BUT I also still would have picked up Zclassic. and doubled that money again.

I've been using Bitmex, but it's hard to make more than modest profit because it's always "overloaded" when the market has big moves.
