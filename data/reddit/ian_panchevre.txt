No no no! Stay the fuck away from Cex.io!!!! One of my colleagues got really excited about crypto and got impatient. He wired $90,000 to Cex.io! Guess what? The wire was never credited to his account. Cex stole his money! His bank account can confirm the wire, but Cex has not credited (It's been nearly 1 month now) and there customer support is completely unresponsive. He is now working with the FBI and his bank to try to get his funds back, but things are not looking good. Stay away from Cex! You have been warned!

Yeah except this time hedge funds are going to dump billions of dollars worth of bitcoin. If you saw a train coming barreling down the train track, would you hop off or HODL?

Why was he raising money? Did he have some sort of emergency? Happy for Andreas! Just wondering if I missed something here...

Wait for the Tether bubble to pop:

Yes, yes, yes. This will 100% happen (when? who knows). Pumping up an asset, then shorting it, then dumping it, is totally illegal in regulated markets. But guess what? Market manipulation happens all the time with crypto. It's the wild wild west. And now Wall Street is giving itself the tools to do it on a bigger and faster scale.

Wise advice. Take some profit now, yes. And don't put BTC on your credit card. Don't mortgage your house. Don't sell your car. Only invest/gamble what you can lose.

I sell everything and move to fiat USD.

Harold (Grandpa's name) will buy back in during the next mega crash and take coins from all the "HODLers" who just can't take it anymore...

If I were you, I would buy a little bit now to build a position and hop on the train, but deploy most of my capital during the next panic sell off. I can't imagine there won't be buying opportunities again below $8,000...

I am deeply concerned about Tether. No, it's not resolved by any means. It's just getting worse (printed $95 million USDT in the last two days). Yes, it will take the whole market down and probably knock out Bitfinex entirely. 
Read and educate yourself. And protect yourself.

Even selling 1 Satoshi breaks the spell that Nakamoto never sold any BTC. So yes, I'd move to cold hard cash (and then buy back in on the massive downswing).

So sorry to hear this, my man... My first bit of advice: Don't dig yourself a deeper hole. If you're tempted to get back in the market, don't. Take a step away and let your mind clear before you try to trade again. 
And be honest with your wife. The money is not coming back any time soon. Time to plan and move forward. You'll get through this.

You have no idea what you are talking about. The CME futures contract will allow you to place bets on the future price of the currency. A short sell is equivalent to betting it will be down in the future. It's a technical distinction, but functionally the same. So yes, it's going to get very easy for not just crypto whales but any run of the mill institutional fund or billionaire to short Bitcoin.

Satoshi owns about 10% of Bitcoin, so if he/she/they are dumping BTC it will tank the market.
