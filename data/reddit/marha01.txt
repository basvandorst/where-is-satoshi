There are ways to make anonymous BTC transactions, especially when most things move off-chain in the future. Monero advantage is a temporary one, just like advantages of other altcoins.

Cant you read with comprehension? Borders still exist even with the internet. The internet made borders vanish, but only for transfer of information. Crypto will hopefully make borders vanish but only for transfer of financial value (and this is not in conflict with usual right wing ideology). Borders for things such as immigration or nation states are not going anywhere and will not be affected by cryptocurrencies.

Most conservatives and nationalists tend to support free trade and exchange of value between nations. Bitcoin may destroy extreme isolationist nationalism (North Korea, Venezuela), but moderate nationalism will be fine.

Crypto will not make borders disappear, in the same way as internet did not make them disappear. It will only make barriers to financial transactions disappear. Free flow of money, information and goods is not at all in conflict with most nationalist or right wing ideology, that is just your straw man view of it. They are against unregulated movement of people. And you would need some kind of a decentralized personal teleport to make those barriers disappear. Not gonna happen anytime soon, if ever.
However, crypto could make welfare state disappear. Hard to fund it when you have big issues with collecting taxes. So if anything, crypto is more of a threat to left than to right.

Then you are wrong. Fascism definition simply does not fit Venezuela, anymore than it fit the Soviet Union.
Whats wrong with plain old "totalitarianism"?

many people expect the price to temporarily go down because big financial institutions will be able to bet on price decrease

It wont but leaving Schengen might. Lets just say that in the long term, having a common border area with countries that have weak immigration enforcement may not be a good idea.

No, the point of Starlink is to bring fast internet to rural or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wealthier people and big cities have fiber already.
