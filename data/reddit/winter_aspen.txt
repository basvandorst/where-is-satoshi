I am sorry you are incapable of critical thought, and I wish you the best going forward.

100% agreed. Take care

No, they're just living off the fruits of what nationalists built. 
Its easy preach collectivist feel-good messages and call critics Nazis; the rest of us are interested in identifying the behaviors and traits of certain groups that find *much* more success and prosperity than others, and we aren't interested in diluting those beneficial behaviors and traits for the sake of delusional idealist fantasies. 
I have no issue with legal Mexican immigrants (I grew up with many) who wish to adopt and embody the values and culture of the United States of America.

While you're correct its also important to note that Democrats lost *everywhere*, not just the presidency.

I believe Donald's rhetoric has reflected exactly this^


Nations are a set of ideas. Borders denote the perimeter of those who share the ideas of the nation in which they live. The condition of nations are the product of the ideas and values shared by the people in those nations. 


If the USA created an embargo preventing US tourism + importing of goods, ended the drug war, and deported all illegals + prevented legals from sending their money there, half of the Mexican population would starve to death. We didn't wreck their economy, we *are* their economy.

That sounds like a great job for the government of Mexico.

That's what happens when you're so incompetent you campaign in states you're guaranteed to win and neglect smaller battleground states.

My source is common sense, but I'm kind enough to do a little googling for you. [These guys]( do a decent rundown of the numbers, all of which are publicly available.
Of course I'm well aware that the only reason to request sources anymore is to attempt to dismiss arguments without addressing them on their merit (and waste other people's time), so by all means have at it.  
Anyway this stuff isn't tough to figure out. Border state that basically advertises itself as the place to 'drop anchor', doesn't enforce any sort of immigration law or voter ID, spends billions subsidizing (incentivizing) jobless broken homes... c'mon now.

Come on man, its California. I'll accept some differences of opinion on most things but get real.
@_date: 2016-12-04 19:47:28
There are many problems. *Illegal* immigrants are just one. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 04:41:52


K. Lets say they're distorting by 50%. Nah, lets go further- 90%. Its still an abysmal net-loss. 


So basically "ain't slave labor neat? Stuff's cheaper". I think I'll get by paying $2 or $5 for a head of lettuce.


Addressing inflation, high taxes, and various regulations + adding tariffs &amp; import taxes are all weapons at our disposal. 


By breaking our law via illegally entering this country.


If you have an issue with the law submit legislation to adjust it. I have no issue with such approaches. Non-enforcement however is not a valid option imo.


Partisan sources indeed. Anyway, such incidents can be addressed an shortcomings of the law can be rectified. Non-enforcement of the law is unacceptable.


Just another product of overly ambitious labor laws and regulations here in the states that can be addressed in time. 
One poor 'solution' after another has produced a number of predictable economic symptoms that can all be alleviated in time. Thankfully the nation is going that direction whether one half of it is upset about it or not. Cheers-

You can read but you seem to have trouble processing the words.
Not only does your post reinforce my last post, but it feeds into my prior posts as well.

Legal immigration is not a problem that needs stopping. **Illegal** immigration is the issue. 
Anyway, I'm all for ending the drug war, as well as enforcing our laws when it comes to *illegal* immigration.

I would have the same opinion if we shared a border with Russia and white males were crossing illegally in droves. 
But hey, keep blaming 'the man' and being racist. You do you.
@_date: 2016-12-04 22:50:50
Okay here there are some things I honestly agree with. 
You can combat it with economics for sure; I'm 100% behind that approach. We're on the same page there. 
That said, the wall prevents the "low hanging fruit" border-crosser, and its absolutely needed (much like Mexico's southern wall is needed to prevent the same thing from SA to MX). 
I'm also against "movements" and identity politics. My views are undeniably nationalistic, so I use the term just for ease of conveying them without listing every opinion I have 1 by 1.
I am also vehemently anti-war, whether that be against terrorism, drugs, or poverty. As a libertarian I don't even want the government to be able to have the power to create the funds to pay for such things. 
As for living off the fruits, I'd say even upon reaching financial independence we still owe those who came before. Fact is the people who came before established a nation with specific values, different from other nations' values. Values like making your own way, accepting the free speech of others, etc. The border is imaginary in the sense its a geographical line that is not visible (mostly), but it is very real in the sense that the people on one side of the line live a certain way, and the people on the other side live another way. Each are entitled to their own values, but not all values and cultures are equal when it comes to promoting prosperity and success. 
Olive branch? I'm tired lol

I am saying her popular vote win is solely attributed to California's immigration enforcement &amp; social spending ideology.
@_date: 2016-12-05 14:25:06
It is estimated that anywhere from 3.5m to 7m illegal immigrants are not employed at all. Many of these people live with individuals who are legal, often times their children who are able to receive benefits such as TANF, WIC, SNAP, and cash welfare. 
That said you're right; an economic solution must be in the cards along with physical prevention of entry. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 01:36:46
I will not deny that employers contribute soc. security funds for undocumented labor- unfortunately those funds are [dwarfed by the overall costs of illegal immigration](


Without these individuals those businesses would be forced to raise their wages to competitive levels in order to attract legal labor. 


An American is an American, and I have no gripe with them. I don't want to hear about how terrible it is that we deport their illegal parents though. Can't have it both ways.


I would prefer a two-pronged approach to the issue. We have laws that I simply want to be enforced. If Mexicans wish to become citizens that's fine- just get in line like the rest of the immigrants who respect and value the law. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 21:02:20
Sorry I respect your right to have an opinion on the matter but you're just wrong. Our representatives are elected to represent *us*, not the rest of the world. Undocumented individuals wear out our infrastructure and utilize our public services without contributing anything whatsoever. Unfortunately they are also statistically shown to commit much greater amounts of crime per capita than normal citizens. Their illegal status also encourages them to commit additional crimes in order to evade law enforcement on top of the crimes they already commit; a phenomenon illustrated by the incredible rates of hit-and-run in border states (over 50% compared to under 10% nationally). Lastly, I would question why you feel these people's lives are "ruined" simply by forcing them to live in their home country? Would it "ruin" an average American's life to return them to the USA? Is Mexico literally hell? The fact of the matter is that Mexico is the result of the cultural values and traditions that its citizens adhere to and vote for. *Illegal* immigrants from Mexico are less likely to adopt American cultural values and integrate successfully for a happy life than their *legal* counterparts; that's the point of having an effective immigration system.

You are living in a nation you jackass. Every single developed society on the planet Earth is a nation-state.

If it were a true democracy California's immigration enforcement (or lack thereof) and social policies would determine every national election from here onward. A handful of counties would effectively decide how life would be for *thousands* of cities and towns across the United States.
