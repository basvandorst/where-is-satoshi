That flashsell!

Did you see how many orders all got filled at once? Pretty impressive
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:42:14
Can you explain what this naming system is and how it works? Cheers! :)

It is much faster if you torrent the blockchain rather than using the client
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:22:23
I'm spending!

I've personally successfully used both coinjar.io AND btradeaustralia.com
Maybe btrade is worth a look?
Edit: Also, I identified myself with coinjar. Note that they have no current way of deleting your information, even if your account closes
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:29:38
I switch between them and coinjar depending on which has the best price (fee included).

haha. I have no money on my exchange atm :(
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:22:01
I love watching these $60+ price drops :)
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:33:49
More power to ya
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:05:21
Ah that makes sense. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:43:59
I tend to agree, but why is a faster proof time a bad thing? I assumed that it'd be good.
Cheers in advance :)
Edit: Sorry, I asked this without first reading on. I found the answer. Thanks anyway :)

First up, make sure you back up the wallet.
You seems to have a fairly good idea about what the password is, hwich is a good start.
If you can remember the exact number of characters then you may be able to figure it out.
I remember hearing in this sub about someone who cracked someones PW for them and actually returned the wallet. Perhaps you can try and find that post and contact the guy? (again, only if you believe the story)
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:51:36
Haha, this gave me a laugh :)

I think that by the time you're taking advice from strangers on the internet, you're already a fish. Speaking in generalities of course
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:24:38
Don't remind me about Julia -_-*
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:29:24
Keep up the good work
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:27:25
That's why I never sell, only buy and use :P 
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:44:09
Yes. Sorry that I wasn't clear. I assumed that the wallet.dat was the only item contained in the encrypted TrueCrypt volume
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:59:02
Honestly, it seems like he was going to try scam you haha
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:31:55
Is this a coffin?
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:18:22
If there are any questions, feel free to ask
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:38:12
Yeah it's confusing me. Btrade's price doesn't fluctuate at all either. Their current sell price is also the previous "steady" buy price
