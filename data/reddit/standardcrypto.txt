Users do need to be online to move money but they also need to be online to log into a web page.
With full lightning, they can send the funds directly to recipient 
A -&gt; exchange -&gt; B
but then the exchange can't act as escrow. 
There's no scenario where the exchange holds on to the funds for more than a brief window of time while acting as escrow. 
Not sure where time locks come into it, other than the channel time locks that apply to all lightning transactions to prevent fraudulent behavior.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:04:59
Academic concern trolling.
It's just putting more locks on the door, and requires changing the protocol.
You still only get 24 hours to retrieve the funds. What if you are at a retreat with no wifi, or in a coma?
Don't keep all funds at an exchange. Don't keep any funds at an exchange that advertises they don't use cold storage. Admittedly it was hard to read between the lines with bitfinex, but one can imagine a future bitcoin that uses this covenants thing but somehow bungles that.
Speed and security don't go together. Exchanges could also work as escrow agents that hold only fiat and briefly escrow bitcoin between otc trades, with everything happening on chain, or later flowing between lightning channels.
There is no need to change the protocol.
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:49:20
quite the contrary, with lightning the exchange could have ZERO control over the crypto funds except for a brief escrow (could be microseconds) period while settling channels.
For the fiat, it could be a bank and they have the fiat, and you have hft trading. Or it could be like coinbase and the exchange doesn't have control over the fiat either, but settling takes longer (days).

Eventually some creditor will defect and say "these motherfuckers owe me money" and the scheme will collapse sooner rather than later.
Without proof of reserves, there's no way for creditors to know where they stand in line, and no incentive for them to report problems, so shenanigans can go on for years rather than hours.
That's why you do proof of reserves.

Bitgo has totally discredited themselves as fiduciaries, and hopefully will die painfully taking all their investors money with them, for allowing this to happen.
But this doens't mean that bitstamp and kraken are in the same situation as bitfinex.
Stamp said they only use bitgo for hot wallet, and I don't know about kraken but hopefully the same, with the cold wallet physically isolated and transactions subject to human approval.
Technically bitgo never advertised themselves as a fiduciary but they kind of crossed the line in some of their press releases, which is why they deserve to die.
But if they don't die, and the humbling teaches them and the rest of the bitcoin ecosystem to tell the truth and be careful with private keys maybe that is ok too.
We should all be on the lookout for exchanges that duplicated bitfinex's idiotic setup.

So many ways.
They could have had segregated hot and cold wallets for each user.
They could have done a proof of reserves scheme with comingled funds.
They could have stopped offering margin to americans.
They could have made a stink about the CFTC and encouraged users to lobby the CFTC with reason and logic to change this rule.
Finally, as a reminder the bitfinex faq page claimed 0.5% was in hot wallet, this was never updated after switch to bitgo scheme.
Blaming the CFTC is the wrong thing. Bitfinex and bitgo are responsible for the bitcoin.

With paper wallets, you have to trust the manufacturer of the hardware you are running the web browser on, plus many other layers of hardware and software such as the browser, the javascript bitaddress is running, the various js libraries this depends on, the js to bytecode compiler, the video drivers that display the address, and on and on.

Sounds to me like you are doing it right.
In a collateral enforcement scenario, if JPM goes to zero the short party takes it all, and if it doubles the long party gets it all.
If it more than doubles the long party would have done better buying the underlying but at least they get something.

On the whole, miners benefit from a declining bitcoin price because if keeps difficulty down which means they have less competition.
Exchanges benefit from being custodians, because they have the option to fractional reserve (or exit scam in the extreme). Lightning would cut into the custodial role because it allows exchange customers to transfer crypto among themselves without third party risk for the fiat (you still need to trust exchange with fiat).
Everybody is going to drag their heels with lightning until they are forced by demand to capitulate and provide this service.

didn't popescu already dump macroscopically during the xt kerfluffle?
since mirceau opposes any size increase, seems he is positioning himself for a volatility trade (facilitated by mpex) betting that block size never increases but hedging himself in case it does. basically mpex will be the place for speculators to bet that "small block" bitcoin will be the surviving chain even if xt or similar seems to have the hashing power "temporarily."
problem is if he has already dumped a lot during the run down to 190 he may not have enough to throw around to push his agenda through.
he needs the b-a yes brigade to get mpex flourishing again to capture cross chain volume when (if) chain splits for real.

Jimmy is going to have a hard time.
He has to not only have discipline for mixing funds etc so his stash is off the radar of the government, but he also needs to trust his counterparties not to report him.
Or he can not trust his counterparties, but he needs to be anonymous to his counterparties, including counterparties that might be government agents tricking him into tax evading transaction they can send him to jail for.  Or enemies that will report him to gov.
Usually the goal for criminals is to PAY taxes, so their funds are legitimate and gov will leave them alone, but make it seem like what they are paying taxes on is non-criminal activity.

Services that monetize well get the most attention.
How would you monetize the "use an arbitrary device for better security" feature?
There probably is a way, maybe even what greenaddress is working on, but it isn't the easiest thing.
I think we will get it eventually though. Maybe when they are giving out hardware wallets as freebies in cereal boxes, or at least you can buy a trezor without being on a wait list for six months.
As a side note, I think the block size limit is probably not going to be raised, meaning that the future of bitcoin is in secure off chain transactions, with the blockchain as a settlement mechanism between wallet services like coinbase/bitpay. So maybe when bitcoin is secure for grandma, it won't be secured by thinking along the lines that you are, but rather having logins to sites like coinbase etc being secure enough (vanilla 2fa etc), and only the services like coinbase need to worry about real security of private keys. Who knows though. In the short term, people are using blockchain for personal transactions, so your concerns are certainly valid.

If price only goes up, early adopters benefit to the point that no one has any bitcoin anymore.
If price drifts down, either wealth is concentrating or diffusing. If concentrating that's bad and bitcoin will eventually die (when the people buying more and more of it realize no one else has any bitcoin); but if the bitcoin is trickling out to more and more people resulting in a more balanced gini coefficient that's good, eventually the circle widens and it becomes useful in more and more places and bitcoin takes over the world.
There's no easy way to tell which way the gini coefficient is heading, but my money is on diffusion and eventual success (and much higher prices). It will just take time for the dynamic to play out.

The real rally, when it happens, will be driven by demand and simply being organically ready. 100 to a thousand is very different from 600 to 6000 let alone 16000.

As I understand it, this is similar to already available m of n signatures. The new part is that the participants can't actually see the funds they are securing. I think both the amount and the address part is somehow hidden.
So you have a conversation like "Friend, keep this paper I'm giving you safe. It's part of securing a very valuable thing. I don't want to tell you what that thing is, or how much it's worth. But, it's valuable. If just you lose it I'm still not ruined because there are some other friends participating in this scheme. But if if 6 of you fuck up, I'm hosed.  So do me a favor and don't lose this."
Come to think of it though, it seems to me you could achieve the same thing with shamir secret sharing of a vanilla private key. Can someone explain how this covers something new?
Wait, I think I get it.
Shamir scheme could cover one key, but it wouldn't be a way of generating arbitrary transactions and have your friends m of n sign them, without knowing what they're signing. This scheme does that.
Note: your friends can still steal your funds (or find out how much money you have, without stealing it) if enough of them betray you.

EDIT: in fact it's worse than that
    "When modeled as a combinatorial game, we have the following properties:
    When all the moves are unrestricted for all player, the proposed algorithm does not work since there is an incentive to con the other player and deviate from the agrees exchange.
    If we restrict the player's moves on either the buyer or the seller by assuming they are using the standard Coinffeine client....."
So, it sounds to me like this scheme only works if both players agree to use some software written by Coinffeeine. (The client.)
But how can you tell that your counterparty didn't roll his own client?

Early adopters are rich but stressed. They believe in bitcoin but they know it could evaporate. Many have sold part of their holdings, and they have trigger fingers on the rest.
That's part of what keeps prices down, or at least stable.
For the price to rise, there needs to be more owners in stronger hands.
This is happening, but meanwhile bitcoin is still inflating at 10% a year until the next halving, which also puts downward pressure on price.
If adoption / shift to more and stronger hands, balances out the above factors for downward pressure, price will stabilize and eventually probably start going up again.
If the early adopters stay stalwart, this puts less downward pressure on price, but it also keeps bitcoin more centralized, and the big money / smart money knows this and will be reluctant to buy in more heavily with so much bitcoin in such few and often anonymous / criminal hands.
It's a complicated dance.

Mulling more:
For cold wallet, you can get rid of the two micro sd card connectors. If there is a keyboard that works with micro usb, that would be perfect. (But I'm not sure if there is, maybe there are only usb keyboards.)
If you only need to enter the seed once, I guess using the touchscreen to enter the twelve words, while awkward, might be good enough. But if you enter the seed every time and then wipe for safety, the keyboard option would certainly make things easier. The keyboard would also be good for entering password, if you're in paranoid mode.
If you don't need keyboard, you can get rid of micro usb.
Then the only thing you need for communicating is the camera. That might be awkward though. If it's really awkward, you need to use either wifi or micro usb for communicating with hot wallet.
If it's wifi or micro usb, you need some way of convincing your users that signed transactions are the only thing wallet ever sends. That might or might not be a feasible solution.

Well, it's the same tradeoffs along the off ledger axis.
But if you wanted to move the actual store of wealth between banks, you're either carting bags of money or bags of gold, either of which takes an armored car which is expensive.
With bitcoin, you just transmit information.
That's why bitcoin is taking over the world. It's simply a cheaper way to move value around when you DON'T want to go off ledger.
The point is, compare apples to apples.
You shouldn't compare a credit card transaction, to spending freshly tipped bitcoin.
CC transaction = coinbase send. (faster.)
Blockchain transaction = physically move gold or banknotes. (slower)
But in the second scenario, while they are both slower, the blockchain transaction is still pretty damn fast compared to the armored truck route.

There needs to be mechanisms to prevent exchanges from colluding with short cartels, or indeed shorting themselves.
This is why we have regulation for legacy money exchanges.
In the case of bitcoin, regulation could help, but there are also cryptographic non-centralized mechanisms which could keep exchanges honest.
Factom for instance is working on machinery whereby exchanges would log every trade on a blockchain.
This would not only provide a warning canary for goxings where the exchange is doing shenanigans it shouldn't be, but also give users tools to evaluate exchanges that seem shady (suspiciously cozy with shorts, let's say) and stay away.
I try not to drink all the libertarian "market will solve everything" kool aid but there really are a lot of places blockchain technology seems to provide almost miraculous alien-level technology for promoting honesty, fair dealing and decentralized trust. The problem is these solutions are theoretical, unintuitive, and it will be a long time before they are mainstream if ever.

There's a bootstrapping issue of how to load up the cold wallet safely with the seed (12 words if electrum).
You might want a usb keyboard dongle on the cold wallet, which is used solely for this purpose. That is, the user would type in the 12 words if they need to bootstrap a new cold wallet.
A tricky bit is metadata, which is to say things like account names. I guess the simplest thing would be to just not support this. But if you could find a way to, it would be a big plus. I can't think of a way to do it without sacrificing the simplicity of your design, but I haven't thought that hard either.
You might also want to look at bip32 wallets for inspiration, they are probably the future.
If you could somehow be electrum compatible, that would be cool.
I think the electrum developer just got some funding and is ramping up his project in a more serious way, so you might want to make contact with him and see if there is a collaboration opportunity.

Bitcoin has similar scarcity properties to gold, and different use properties.
Gold's use properties are industrial. Bitcoin's core use property is that it takes bitcoin to send bitcoin, because of transaction fees.
These are negligible now, but if bitcoin takes over the world transaction fees will play a role in setting a floor to the bitcoin price; just as industrial uses matter for gold.

Interesting timing...
My conclusion is that the best possible thing for the mastercoin ecosystem is for the price to crash down, and stay down.
These unjustified bubbles get everyone giddy, full of hubris, and lazy -- or just distracted, which is almost the same.
A low valuation keeps focus on the dev, keeps the early whales on their toes so they cash out sooner when there is a rise, and generally keeps the overall project sane.
Not to mention it gives fresh money a chance to accumulate small positions across more hands, which is the healthiest thing for the ecosystem.
It's probably a good time to buy mastercoin (along with other 2.0 assets), but nobody should be expecting to get rich quick, or ever for that matter.
I'm glad to see there are more offerings in the pipeline.

I like it from the design and usability perspective, but I think you got some things wrong.
Use electrum/armory with viewing/signing wallet split, as your guides
Cold wallet shouldn't even display a balance. It should do one thing and one thing only. Hold high value private keys, and sign transactions with them.
Warm wallet should display two balances:
  -- Warm balance: (safe to carry around town, keys on wallet)
  -- Cold balance: (addresses on warm wallet, keys on cold wallet)
For people that really have a lot of bitcoin you might want more than one "warm" wallet, to avoid flashing around high balance when going about day to day. (Even if it isn't spendable, it might make you noticable to criminals.)
To access coins on cold wallet, generate transaction unsigned transaction on warm wallet, transmit to cold using qr code and camera, and transmit signed transaction back to warm wallet using qr code and camera again. Warm wallet can then transmit transaction to network. Warm wallet should have wifi/connectivity, cold wallet not.
You might also want a way to check addresses on cold wallet, to protect against address substitution attacks. (A little hand wavy, but see standardcrypto blog.)
Overall very nice. I wish you good luck and if you have questions or would like to discuss feel free to pm.
Final note, all communication should be with camera and qr codes, get rid of the dongle that connects warm and cold wallets. If the camera is very expensive maybe come up with another plan, but if you can do it with a cheap camera that would really be ideal. It will also play better with other systems.

Yes, definitely.
Most merchants cash into fiat, like 99% most.
A lot of bitcoin spenders are early rich, and spending bitcoin at overstock is just another way to reduce the hoard (and the risk that goes with it) by putting into something less volatile.
The people that are buying the bitcoin are people that would like to have more bitcoin than they have now, i.e. late adopters.
So currently the merchant flow is moving money from early adopters to later adopters.
The more the flow, the more the supply. Late adopters prop up the market at the current price, but when it looks like there's plenty of coin for sale and support looks weak, the price drifts down into later adopters decide it looks good.
Paradoxically, the bitcoin price might have to go down to get a reasonable distribution into the mainstream, and reduce the massive amount of hoarding by early adopters.
Early adopters don't like it when the price goes down but suck it up, rich boys.
When (ok if) merchants starting hoarding some of the bitcoin they get rather than immediately flipping it for fiat this dynamic will reverse. Potentially violently.

If you'd gone "off blockchain" with both you and the sender having coinbase accounts and the send being just a ledger move within coinbase, it would have been quicker.
But you would have been vulnerable to coinbase shenanigans, like fractional reserve.

nice words but i don't share your optimism.
Seems to me the same challenges exist for assasination markets as for the original silk road. It's difficult to establish a reputation but it can be done and once accomplished it can run for a long a time. as with silk road, there are ideologically motivated people who will run a death registry behind tor, and do the other pieces as well.
it seems to me this is quite bad for bitcoin, and civil society in general.
the first victims will probably be labor union leaders, journalists, etc. maybe even public persons who support the idea of assasination politics. total clusterfuck, and probably extremely bearish for the price. so i hope it doesnt happen for a while.
the last link in the chain are the tor exit node operators.
so, i think the end game of assasination politics is it will be illegal to run a tor exit node.
people will still do it, and it will be possible to stay anonymous on the internet, but a lot harder than it is today.

I support an increase, but I'm not a fanatic about it.
It's reasonable to see what core comes up with for now, and how long it will take while some miners are also signaling open-ness to raise the block size without buy in.  This is anti fragility at work.
Samson Mow can be patient, because mining revenues are high enough, halving hasn't happened, and frankly there's not that much mem pool fee pressure (other than spam attacks) from organic demand.  
If it's a year or two for now, price is stagnant, mempool is regularly full of high fee transactions that miners can't collect, and lightning is stuck in rewrite hell with nothing concrete to show, miners will increase block size for purely selfish reasons, independent from block size drama on reddit.
The only danger is that an altcoin will surpass bitcoin in the meantime, perhaps a proof of stake coin or ethereum-like.
But core has a point as well.  Block size should not be increased lightly.

move them gradually, and move them to addresses where the funds can't immediately be spent, using op_cltv (op_hodl).
if all funds were moved in this manner, with only a small fraction spendable, satoshi would be signalling to the market that he is in it for the long haul, he has faith in bitcoin, and nothing is going to tank the market (at least he is not).  It might actually raise the price.
To keep the funds publicly hodled, satoshi could keep moving the funds once a week, pushing back the hodl experitation day indefinitely.
People would "watch satoshi" like today we watch the fed.  But it wouldn't be an all or nothing thing, it would be "ooh, he's selling a tiny bit more now.  does this mean anything?"

It won't keep doubling at the current rate. Assuming full world domination (million to 10 million dollar bitcoin), it will double another ten times or so, and then top out at a yottahash (1000 exahash) in 15-20 years. This ignores moores law so the final number may be a bit higher, but not a trillion or more times higher.

Yes, there is a well known prophecy that has it briefly touching 415 USD. The prophecy is unclear as to why this happens. Either multiple simultaneous exchange hacks, or maybe BU block size increase hard fork.
According to the prophecy, this large downward move is necessary for the price to move higher than its current congestion zone. 
The prophecy also states that a film will be leaked of the POTUS pleasuring himself. Interestingly, this will not negatively affect his approval ratings. At any rate, the price can not move higher till after the POTUS webcam leak.
Finally, the next large move ("mooning" as some call it) can not happen before 2019. Probably means no ETF for this phase of price growth.
This three part prophecy is expected to chart the future of bitcoin for the foreseeable future.

I generally appreciate mike hearn, and I support large blocks, but I find this analysis unnecessarily alarmist.
In particular, as evidence blocks are filling up, hearn cites problems at the prohashing pool.
From what I understand, these concerns are overblown.
Prohashing is a low power hobbyist pool, which pays out small amounts frequently to a large number of miners.  This results in large transactions, and to make this economical prohashing has to make tx fee for these large transactions significantly smaller than the recommended tx fee rate.  I don't have time to track down proof of this now, but I recall this from a bitcointalk thread.  (Further confirmation or refutation of my claim would be appreciated.)
This amounts to small time miners who insist on frequent payment for tiny shares, being pushed out.  These are transactions that bitcoin can survive without. 
In short, yes blocks are filling up and yes we need bigger blocks, but we aren't at a crisis point yet, and it's possible mike is being disingenous by citing prohashing as evidence.
Not so much disingenous, as rationalizing a decision involving macroscopic amounts of his own personal wealth which has experienced a wild ride.  To me he sounds simply burned out.
Good luck with r3 mike, your work is appreciated and you will be welcome back anytime.

I think you might have confused what btchip communicated actually.
Btchip stated


and you contradicted this. Note the *seed* there.  It's not 100% clear, but I think he meant what you are calling mnemonic.  Otherwise he would have said "they still need to know the mnemonic *and* the seed passphrase."
Fleshed out: 
I think by "seed passphrase" he meant what  you are calling (and the bip39 spec calls) mnemonic sentence, and I am calling seed phrase (also in my last blog post).
As opposed to user-specified or supplementary passphrase. Which you, following the bip39 spec, are simply calling "passphrase."
I think the root cause of the confusion is the wording of the bip39 spec: "mnemonic sentence" is poorly named.
It's not a sentence. It's just a list of words.  It is a mnemonic, but then again so is the optional user-specified supplementary passphrase.  Sentence here is particularly unfortunate since the user-specified passphrase *could* be a sentence and that would probably be a good idea.
It's not really a phrase either, but I think that's ok.  Passphrase is generally understood to simply mean "long password."
I would change the bip39 spec as follows.
    mnemonic sentence ==&gt;&gt; seed passphrase or core passphrase or device passphrase (since it is device generated)
    passphrase ==&gt;&gt; supplementary passphrase or secondary passphrase or user passphrase or salt passphrase (since it is used for pbkdf2 salt)
And I would try to use these terms going forward to avoid future confusion.
tldr, Congratulations on the popularity of the trezor and adoption of bip39, now help people understand how to use it with good documentation :)
BTW, I would go with "device passphrase" and "user passphrase" if you want my opinion.

Thinking about this, seems that it would be a good idea if wallets deterministically spent outputs.  Then if a wallet accidentally rebroadcasted the same wanted transaction twice, without knowing the first was already gone, the second would fail because it used same outputs.

consensus majority could make decision to destroy outputs older than a certain age (like satoshi coins).
there would be announcements: "move your coins or you will lose them."
the motivation would be to determine if satoshi coins (and other quiescent money) are lost forever or just hybernating.
if they're lost forever, they can be removed from the mempool, and also the market has a more accurate view of the true monetary base. (there would probably be a significant uptick in price if old coins are lost). if it turns out satoshi coins are still viable, price would drop but at least this knowledge would be priced in as a one time event going forward.
this is pretty unlikely to happen, but I could imagine it wihtin the realm of posibility.
so to answer the original question, you would lose your coins if they fall before the cutoff date, if you just sit on your hands and do nothing for long enough and this scenario comes to be.

Using electrum instead of armory to split watching and signing wallets makes it much easier. Otherwise looks pretty good.
You could boot to a live CD every time rather than keep state. Easy to do this with Ubuntu, probably doable with windows too.
You might also consider sealing the cold computer in a tamper resistant evidence bag which you sign every time you seal it, to prevent someone bugging the keyboard to steal your password. This also helps you resist the temptatikn to use the machine for other purposes.
Your most likely problems are either fucking up the backups/forgetting passwords, or an evil roommate attack. So don't ignore physical security. Make sure people with fragmented backups know what to do if you get hit by bus. Do a fire drill. Pita I know but live by the sword.....

Counterintuitive but see 
Look at the history. Asicminer was ANNIHILATED by rising bitcoin price and fierce competition for hashrate share.
And if you still don't believe me, ask a miner. Someone you trust, not a PR flack for a major mining operation.
If you know the facts, it's really really obvious / non controversial.
And for the final proof, see if bitmain comes up with a 2/4/8 mb compromise that would have a chance of sign off from core. It won't happen. BU is a stalling tactic that he KNOWS will never be approved by the economic majority. It doesn't matter. The point is to block segwit and stagnate the price for a while so he can accumulate more coins.

and disagree if you will, but at least understand what the hashrate share means to a miner. 
Fees don't really matter that much at this point. Well, they're 13%. They matter. But the bulk of the fight is for the block reward.
Better to accumulate more bitcoin at a lower price, and with lower transaction fees, than less bitcoin at a higher price, because you are being outspent by frickin exxon.
That is, assuming you are long bitcoin and believe it may eventually take over the world.
Bitmain can always let the price rise by approving segwit, once Jihan has accumulated enough and/or is not making a healthy profit due to organic dilution of rising hashrate and eventual halvings. In a few years I guess (safer).
Or the economic majority can force his hand by unleashing UASF and getting segwit approved sooner -- riskier, but better for hodlers, if it works.

pools are like politicians... they have to find the right blend of message to get people to vote for them or at least not defect
miners want price low, but not too low
they want economic majority apathetic (not pissed enough to do uasf) but not dumping either

This assumes all bitmain miners are S9s. In fact the s9s are probably supplementing a much larger population of older miners, gradually being replaced as they die.

You're not wrong, but there's an even more fundamental reason to block segwit.
BitMain/PBOC are trying to suppress price by delaying segwit, it's as simple as that.
This BU fud is just a pretext.
Hashrate follows price. With a rising price, more miners would chase the hashrate, more competition for Bitmain. Maybe those bitfury blockboxes would finally start selling.
Miners want the price to go up EVENTUALLY, but after staying low as long as possible so they can accumulate.
Bitmain is accumulating bitcoin at a suppressed price, with a greater share of the network.
The solution to this monopoly isn't dropping prices to force his hand, it is raising the hashrate so he is diluted out. Which happens with a rising price. Or, with time, as block reward halvings phase in over the years.
I am opposed to UASF for safety reasons, but if this forces his hand it might be better for hodlers even with the risk. Otherwise it's stagnant prices and wait for block halvings perhaps.

BU is all about stopping lightning... BU will NEVER activate segwit, or allow lightning, they are lying when they say they might.
the intuition is that lightning makes spamming / fee manipulation too expensive for miners.
with full blocks and no lightning, no matter what the block size, fee manipulation need only happen at the margins since trustless transactions are forced on chain.
with lightning, I would expect much smaller blocks and all blocks representing real activity (clearing). When fees get pricey, users react by switching to lightning wallets, not paying higher fee.
very humbling situation for miners, especially if they are not certain about price size increase. 
clearing on chain (aka no lightning) really does enable miners to keep control of bitcoin, by maintaining their ability to do fee manipulations to keep blocks full and fees high.
in this light, the recent "spam attacks" with full blocks can be interpreted as experiments by miners (bitmain) to see how high they can push fees.
basically how sticky are high fees once achieved, and how long does it take the mempool to clear.

I think this litecoin pump might actually be rational, if it is on the basis of segwit activation.
That of course is the narrative. The actual hashing numbers don't show this -- bitcoin stil has more segwit support than litecoin. But perhaps the pumpers have insdier info.
At any rate if segwit activates this actually makes litecoin tangibly more valuable, for instant trustless value routing between all exchanges that accept litecoin — great for arbitrage. Arbitrageus WILL buy litecoin, if only to use lightning to move money more quickly. Will take some months for lightning on litecoin to emerge of course.
assuming bitmain/ver conspiracy controls both litecoin and bitcon asics, the conspiracy would be to first pump eth, then litecoin and perhaps other segwit approving altcoins, and only after a number of altcoins have segwit and actually functioning wallets and it's being used for arb, only then to approve it for bitcoin. maybe in a year or two.
UASF is the wildcard in this scenaior.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:44:32
Miners benefit in the SHORT TERM from a a stagnant or decreasing bitcoin price. Lower price, lower hash rate, less competition.
Miners know that activation of segwit will hold the price back. That is why they are blocking it. In fact you can tell which miners have become hodlers by which pools are backing segwit (bitfury). 
Over time, miners become hodlers, paying back their loans and accumulating significant amounts of bitcoin.
When enough miners have become hodlers, pressure to activate segwit will increase and it will eventually go live.
Could be years though.

There are very few attack vectors for hardware wallets.
Let's set aside attacks that require a farraday cage to defend against, and consider only undirected attacks.  
Assuming compromised firmware on the HW, the only attacks I am aware of are side channel attacks, and with deterministic signatures I think that door is closed.
Address subsitution attacks require compromising both the trezor and the transaction-generating device.  Possible, yes.  But extremely difficult, and certianly more difficult than replacing HW with vanilla offline computer with much larger attack surface and far less tamper resistance.
My advice here is intended for average users.
You see what contortions typical users go through for security (eg look at 
on current thread.  
The risk isn't really stolen coins assuming offline security is followed properly with cold off-the-shelf computer rather than HW approach.
The risk is that for unsophisticated users, contortions will result in security through obscurity and then lockout due to nonstandard approach or anxiety from paranoia resulting in trying to memorize things that should really be written down.  
Assuming everything done properly, offline cold computer is about on par with retail HW for security, yes.
And HW can be hacked at the factory (via a side channel I guess?) just like offline computer can be bugged by active atacker / evil maid.
But when you compare the ease of use of HW, versus all the pitfalls and paranoia and lack of standardizing of going offline, I think the choice is clear, if you want to onboard a lot of people and get coins securely off exchanges and into hardened individual owners.
HW are the better choice.

@_date: 2016-06-15 15:55:07
Why does bip44 reduce security? From
the account hierarchy starts
m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index
First three levels are hardened (indicated by the apostrophe).
The non hardened levels at the end for change indicator and address index are the same in all bip32 wallets, right?
What is the security issue?
I think I see.  bip32 recommends (and bip44 follows this) non-hardened change addresses, and you don't want to do that.
The rationale for the recommended default is this way you can share a single mpubkey per account with your accountant (or whoever), and they can follow income and outgo.
Otherwise you have to share two mpubkeys per account (active and change). This would be the case with your scheme.
I understand being paranoid by default, but I think more people will run this if you do bip44 by default.
Typical use case would be to have a viewing wallet in the cloud with a live node, and continue to use electrum 
or whatever with local wallets unchanged as before.
In any case I am very happy to see this, and thank you for your work.

From your first link
"For gold or silver there's an actual cost of production price floor. Oil makes up a large part of that floor, but even if you invent free energy, you're still constrained by the fact that you're in a closed ecosystem with limited supply and most of what can be mined has already happened anyway, and most things on the periodic table have some type of inelastic demand in the first place."
If you had free energy, both gold and bitcoin would go to zero.
You could print gold out of water by tearing the protons out and mushing them back into a new shape, or get more gold from asteroids using your new energy source to power the rockets, or whatever.
In this far fetched world, your new money substitute would be something that is not constrained by energy. Perhaps attention, or some social goodwill measure like Cory Doctorow's "whuffie."
The point is, in this world, the actual world, you don't have free energy.
Both bitcoin and gold are constrained by this inconvenient fact in a similar way.
"If you have no fee market, you don't even have a price floor with a static transaction flow variable in place. So you then need a block size police force run as a centralized technocracy to prevent anyone from changing it. "
No police force is needed. The block size is enforced by checks and balances between miners who can decide what gets mined, and bitcoin holders who can dump their hoard if the block size does something they don't like, and economically important nodes such as exchanges which decide which chain to follow. You can see this dynamic playing out today pretty nicely according to the original plan.
Bitcoin is basically gold that you can send over a wire.

These are valid blocks according to the protocol. If other miners choose not to build on them, and exchanges chose not to follow these blocks "we don't accept chains where there are &gt; x number of recent empty blocks" this is basically a fork. I think bitcoin would be in an ethereum type situation.
Perhaps the best thing for bitcoin would be to have empty blocks (no transactions) for a while, and hope that eventually the PBOC runs out of money/coal or enough mining power accrues outside the attacking mine.

And IIRC, it wasn't so much bearish as expressing a strong TECHNICAL preference for bitcoin over ethereum. Which is to say they understand the underlying economic models of both, and expected bitcoin to ultimately prevail.

I agree that bitcoin will eventually be a base layer of the internet.
A big problem now is security / spam / DOS attacks... bitcoin can solve all of these.
Basically will quash DOS attacks by making it easy to ignore people who are too noisy, unless they also pay the listener for the privilege.
Spam? Same thing basically, go ahead and send your spam... as long as you pay the reader for the privilege.
Security? Bitcoin addresses (and lightning public keys)  easily give you a way to tied your identity to a cryptographic secret. All kinds of higher levels and webs of trust can base of this.
Someday bitcoin will literally mean the freedom to speak digitally -- when people would rather not listen to you. Attention is a commodity, and it will be purchased with bitcoin. 
There may be multiple internets based on top of bitcoin... but there will be only one bitcoin.

Well, I guess I would add to the list "Can you run the software on a secure platform?"
In practice, I believe for most users this is really only true for hardware wallets.
For software only wallet, you have to boot with live cd, on hardware platform that you know has not been tampered -- including by yourself, by accidentally clicking a link. This is in practice impossible for most users.
Possible of course to tamper a hardware wallet, but much MUCH harder.
Also you should add to the list "Do you trust the random entropy used for private keys? And/or "Can you control the random entropy used for private keys?"
For software wallets this is rather tricky, is /dev/random really safe on your particular platform? What a rabbit hole. For hardware wallets it boils down to can you trust the manufacturer and supply chain. Still a rabbit hole, but a smaller one.  
Also (for both software and hardware wallets) if it's bip39 as usual, you can and should add a passphrase that you control so the second question can be answered in the affirmative.

Open source and reproducibility is why I prefer trezor to ledger. 
Platform security is not just for windows. Linux, droid and iphone are all better than windows, but you get viruses and trojans there too. Compared to a hw the attack surface is too large for comfort with any non-purpose specific platform. It's really not a tractable problem. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 23:11:30
I agree, but I also think that in practice, this is technically too difficult for the majority of users. Also I think most attacks were not due to compromised wallet privacy, but poor irl opsec.
The proper thing probably is to use wasabi for privacy, mix in batches, and move to hw after mixing. That way if wasabi is compromised you don't lose everything, just one batch of mixing. But again, too hard for realistic use.
So my default recommendation is to use a hardware wallet and just keep a low profile for privacy and hope for the best. Hopefully the situation will improve in the not distant future.

\++ Trezor and Electrum. I recommend this myself. But to me, this is really just choosing a front end for using with a hardware wallet.
I don't think it's possible to use software wallets in a safe way, for funds that it would hurt to lose. The attack surface is just too large.
I mean, of course it is possible in theory. But most people can't manage it. One wrong click, and a virus has all your secrets now.
It's simpler to just default to a hardware wallet.

I would create a google doc spreadsheet and communicate using the docs comments flow. The final product could then find its way to github. Just my 2c on that.
Cost of 51% attack:
I would add another category of attack, call it "psy ops." For instance, terrorism or kidnapping demanding anonymous bitcoin ransoms. This could be real criminals, or government trying to rally public opinion against bitcoin so they can ban it or implement whitelisting schemes (actually what's the difference?). I am virtually certain this will happen eventually, and it may be the turning point that sends bitcoin into the next bear market (or the one after that). I intend to write a blog post about this at some point. These types of false flag operations are cheap as heck, if the stakes are high. So you could add a row for that.

I think trezor is a great product and have recommended it to many people. However, physical security is part of their security model.
"Quickly and trivially" is not well defined. If you use a passphrase, you need the passphrase to steal funds not just the physical device. Not that hard to get with a tareted attack though. The point is that physical security matters when dealing with hardware wallets. It is naive to suppose otherwise. This applies to all wallets, including those with secure elements (like ledger).  For instance, an attacker can substitute a bugged wallet for your real wallet, and steal your pin number that way (this "evil maid attack" is in the Trezor faq iirc).
Rather than debate me about this,  why don't you ask your question on r/trezor and have them confirm what I am saying. This has already been confirmed, I just don't feel like digging up the thread. It's common knowledge, nothing controversial.

I don't think I understand what you are trying to say.
Yes, you should consider privacy,  but in practice the overwhelming concern is not to get ripped off.
Real privacy is hard to achieve, impossible for most users I would say. Perhaps in the future as the software matures.
If privacy is your thing you should probably use wasabi. Not hardware wallet compatible unfortunately, though again, perhaps in future.

You may want to have a look at 
Hashing Assurance Contracts. Mike Hearn's proposed end state solution to secure bitcoin, if a fee market doesn't provide adequate security when the block subsidy runs down.
@_date: 2015-08-18 11:34:03
Do enough people need faster confirmations to sustain a fee market at anything approaching current rates of hashing, though?  That is the question.
Clearly at this moment, the answer is no.
So what makes you think this situation will change, particularly at the fixed 1mb level? (Since I take it you advocate mircea's 1mb limit.)
also "what makes you think they will have climbed" is quoting me out of context, since it leaves what I was replying to out... which of course doesn't make sense but... is not what I said... I guess.
More, for the tragedy of the commons scenario with vanilla fees: yes speed matters all other things being equal.  I think often though, it just doesn't matter that much.  Trust matters more.  So, you outsource your trust to, oh say, coinbase, possibly with multisig, possibly with CPFP for bumping up transactions fee gently over time till it gets mined.  The recipient trusts coinbase.  They know they'll be paid eventually.  A month is too long, yeah.  A few blocks... enh, it's fine.
Rather than coinbase, it could also be some darknetmarket with wide trust and parsimonious transactions policy, same principle almost applies. (Slightly more need for speed.)
So I can see how a dynamic could develop that fees stay VERY low, with or without small blocks, forcing hash rate down, absent other non-pure-vanilla dynamics.  If you think this concern makes me a derpy communist who would rather ride the bus than in mircea's ferrari... whatever man.
@_date: 2015-08-17 07:00:54
It's speculation about a fairly distant future, but I don't see the flaw.
If a given level of hashing is required to secure a certain volume of commerce, and post some halving the fee market isn't sustaining that level of hashing, merchants and banks and other heavy users of the chain would band together to assure the chain; as today users of a public good like a lighthouse.
These aren't charitable donations, but a community funding its collective security, and could be enforced via membership dues, social pressure, and other mechanisms. 
Where's the flaw?

51% attack should be in the list somewhere, spelled out explicitly
I think it would be helpful to add a column for $cost. This is hard to estimate of course, but in some cases (like 51% attack) it's not so hard. When you look at the chart this way, it clearly sets out a path that bitcoin's job (and bitcoin supporters) is to make all these costs high enough to be safe against state sponsored attackers (or whoever). Where the cost of attack is low and the damage is high, is where the danger is greatest.

Now we have a system with a huge subsidy to miners, to get things bootstrapped, but which is guaranteed to end some day, and nobody knows what will happen then.
There's no guarantee that a vanilla fee market would emerge to support a sufficient hash rate to support global commerce, with 1mb capped blocks, either. Nor are larger blocks expected to result in a destroyed fee market, that guarantees miner doom after some halving event in the future.
It's hard to predict how these things will play out, and that's why it's good to have options.
What do you do if hash rate drops post some halving, and you start seeing double spends, but when miners try to raise transaction rates individuals would rather use non-bitcoin solutions than pay the higher fees?
Just declare bitcoin has failed?
Assurance contracts is a realistic evolution and repsonse in that eventuality.
If transaction fees alone suffice to keep bitcoin safe, in the steady state future, great. Nobody will bother with assurance contracts.
The point is I'm saying to consider the failsafe of assurance contracts in a steady state future, regardless of the block size debate.

120MW/sec should just be
120MW or 100,000kw (rounding down for napkin math)
In general, I like to think in terms of rates rather than annual usage.
US home consumes about 1kw
So we wind up at ~ same number of 100,000 homes.
BTW you can generate about 0.01 kw/m2 of solar, so that's 
10,000,000 m2 of solar if the bitcoin network was running on renewables or a 10km by 10km square, which sounds about right for 100,000 homes.

You want a link, fine, it's all covered in trezor faq
"Inspect the TREZORs memory with an electron microscope
You might imagine yourself dissolving the TREZOR CPU in acid, finding the reprogramming fuse, repairing it, and then loading evil firmware on the TREZOR. I’m no science fiction author, but my guess is – this might be possible. However, the Cortex M3 is a sensitive multilayer chip. The components inside are much smaller than those fake eBay amps. Chances are, all you’d end up doing is destroying the chip. Even if you succeeded in doing so, this will be a costly and time-consuming task. In the end, the bitcoins will be gone already because the original owner will have changed their recovery seed upon discovering that their TREZOR was stolen."
TLDR: secret is not buried in a secure element, given patience and a lab you can probably dig it out.
"Evil maid attack - replace the TREZOR with a fake
It might be possible for an evil ninja, or your little brother, to steal your TREZOR and replace it with a fake TREZOR. If the fake TREZOR was embedded with a wireless transmitter, then the fake TREZOR could wirelessly transmit any PIN it received. The attacker would then have full access to your funds.
If you are concerned about such an attack, it is a good idea to sign the back of your TREZOR with a permanent pen. Don’t forget to check the signature before each use.
The TREZOR’s chassis is sealed using ultrasound. Opening the TREZOR without destroying the case is nearly impossible."
TLDR: keep your trezor physically secure, don't just leave it lying around.

Bullion vaults could get government repo'd, like roosevelt did in the 1930s.  Don't think it couldn't happen again.
Same with bitcoin stored with 3rd parties, but it's a lot easier to take control of the bitcoin.
You said majority do not hold gold in banks, and I don't know about that.  Not saying you're wrong, but I'd like a source for that.
I did some napkin math, and half a percent of gold monetary base is tied up in GLD etf, assuming no fractional reserve shenanigans. (Big if) As a side note, it's interesting the the winklevoss bitcoin etf, if approved, would be in the same ballpark size with respect to portion of monetary base. 
My guess is majority of gold holders are not individuals, but institutions. And that a big reason for institutions to hold gold is "psychological collateral."  Not actual collateral, but other institutions in the interlocking black box of leveraged global finance see this is something that COULD be used as collateral with their counterparties if needed, if things get squirrely.  Which is a concern that is more and more on the radar.  The more gold the counterparty has verified (pricewaterhouse audit says so) the safer you sort of feel.
But, the big conspiracy theory goes, the institutions themselves are squirrely with the collateral, because gold is hard to verify, even for pricewaterhouse/kpmg. And there are perverse incentives for pwc/kpmg to lie if the government tells them to or for other reasons, like they did with enron.  So the price is low, and when "we the people" demand physical delivery, there will be a huge runup (for the gold that is actually there).
All well and good, but my take is, why jump through all these mental hoops, why not just start taking advantage of the transparency of bitcoin? It has to be dawning on some of the 1%, not to mention some of the institutional risk management officers in the above scenario...
Of course with gold there is no 51% attack risk though...

Law enforcement will identify addresses you control based on withdrawals from places like coinbase/circle.
Justice system will make life your hard for you, with "we'll embarass you in front of your wife" at the soft end and "guantanamo" at the hard end.
They will let you go if you hand over the passwords/keys.
In many cases it will actually be bad guys that get pulled into the dragnet, but there is always collateral damage.
Ironically, a good way to protect yourself against such treatment would be to stage a theft and report the coins stolen to the police.  If it looks like "bitcoin confiscation" (like gold confiscation after the liquidity crisis of the 1930s) is on the agenda, I am sure people will start doing this.

There are perfectly reasonable bitcoin atms all over the world, just not in the united states because of enhanced aml/kyc.
The way bitcoin atms should work is as a software enhancement to the existing already installed atm infrastructure.  You should be able to wire e-money somewhere, or deposit cash to an atm, and get this cashed out to an address of your choice.
Or you should be able to send bitcoin to an address, and cash it out of an atm given a special customer code.
Outside of the US, that is how bitcoin atms work.
When the dust settles, I suppose that's how they'll work eventually in the US as well. Using the atms we already have, but with updated software.
It's ridiculous to build out a whole separate category of machines just to work with bitcoin.

First seen safe replace by fee does not have the double spend problem.
FSS RBF has widespread political support (eg I think peter todd approves despite being contentious otherwise) and some miners are already supporting it.
So far as I know, no miners support unsafe straight rbf currently, which is probably a good thing.
We'll hopefully wind up with widespread fss rbf when the dust settles. 
Cpfp does make double spending easier. currently only eligius allows it and mike hearn and others have a problem with this. 
The way you can use cpfp to doublespend is submit two transactions, and then use cpfp feature to ensure that the one you want is the one that gets confirmed (if it gets mined by eligius)
Maybe miners that allow cpfp will be punished somehow, like by block withholding attacks or something.
There are some non-criminal use cases for straight rbf (and cpfp) as well, but it's a much more contentious way to do things and has only limited political support.

How does CPFP not make double spends easier?  (Honest question).
You submit two transactions (intentionally to cheat the exchange), and you can influence which one gets accepted by specifying an additional transaction.  To the extent that miners accept your offer of additional fees, you can steer the double spend.
My understanding is "replace" in RBF/FSS RBF and the "child pays" mechanisms are fundamentally different.
In the "replace" mechanisms there is only one transaction that gets recorded, but in the CPFP mechanism there are (at least) two with one building on the other.

"My money is on the reason being a mining economic tussle about time to market of ASICs, in a consolidating and maturing market, with real-politic and business confidential information we are not party to."
Miners want to suppress price, simple as that.
I am not sure how co-investment among the major miners could help here. Either you are a miner that is also a hodler (paid off loans and accumulating bitcoin) or you are still trying to make back your investment and want to hold back hashrate to hold on to your share.
Even big whale miners that are also holders are probably better off holding off hash rate increases in the short term, as they can comfortably accumulate meanwhile. They know the price will rise as soon as they activate segwit, and can meanwhile stealthily accumulate. 
All incentives are aligned for foot dragging against segwit among miners.
UASF is short cut to force miners to accept segwit (but more dangerous). Or option b, wait for organic hashrate increase plus threat of eventual halving to force miners to allow price increase from approving segwit. Might be another year in that case.

Can someone explain what the use case is for armory, versus hardware wallets?
What is either 
    -- already doable with armory
    -- in the roadmap
that can't be done any other way?
My view is that airgapping, and maintaining an airgap, is simply too cumbersome for most operations, even highly sensitive ones, and that therefore the industry is consolidating around hardware wallets.
If there was a future for armory, I'd say it would be a non-airgapped solution for managing multiple high value wallets, which interoperates with hardware wallets.  So the emphasis would be on snazzy interface for power users with lots of wallets (trusted third party) and not on the super high security path.  But I'm not an armory user, maybe someone could enlighten me...

" I have to spend this BTC through the channel of the wage payer or..."
The point of lightning network is that all endpoints should be reachable (like the internet). So this could be restated
"I have to spend this BTC through the lightning network"
Moving on
"the wage payer determines the fee to route my payment"
I don't think this is true. My understanding is that every hub along the path can add a small fee for routing, but this fee is expected to be tiny because there is competition within hubs, all hubs are equal modula trust/reliability/uptime. And a trust breach is an inconvenience, not a loss of funds. So it's really not comparable to lock in with banking.
"If next month the payer has to pay me 3BTC again and I only have spend 1BTC from previous month he will need to make a new channel of 2BTC or close the old channel and make a new one of 5BTC."
I still think this is nonsensical. Payer will use existing channel to send another 3 btc, if there are enough funds in the channel. Or, payer will open new channel.
Realistic scenario, say you are google employee.
payment routing:
Google -&gt; ADP/Bitwage &lt;payroll&gt; -&gt; Coinbase -&gt; Fred Smith &lt;employee&gt;.
Google will have a big channel open with ADP, which it ocasionally does have to close but not too often.
Now let's say Fred Smith wants to buy something from amazon .This gets routed
Fred Smith -&gt; Coinbase -&gt; Bitpay -&gt; Amazon
When google closes its ADP channel, this has no effect on the Coinbase -&gt; Fred Smith channel.
Transaction volume goes way down compared to everything trust free on ledger. Exactly as was claimed all along.

I'm not saying you're wrong. You make good points.
To clarify, when I said "no one would notice" I meant the basic paradigm we have now might persist even with much more valuable bitcoin.  To a casual observer, things wouldn't look THAT different (necessarily).  You could still buy stuff with fiat, and most people would.
There would be more buy/sell points for bitcoin (on par with gold) but it would still be "store of value" not something you use day to day (in this scenario).  
People would still grumble and say "bitcoin's dangerous, too volatile" and mostly stay away from it, except the kind of people that would buy gold, stock up on ammo, and talk about the apocalypse on reddit.
In terms of the hugeness of the shift of assets, consider too that it doesn't take 2T USD to move the price 2T, just whatever it takes to move the order books.  (Same to the downside.)
Again, not picking a fight, just painting a glass half full scenario in case it gives you additional futures to consider.
As a final point to consider, the same fractional reserve shenanigans and plunge protection / price manipulation games that sovereign wealth management plays with gold to control the price, could also be played with bitcoin -- if enough people can be convinced to keep their bitcoin with third parties that is of course.
Yes there'd be more worry about inflation, countries defaulting or getting closer to defaulting... but this is sort of the world we already live in isn't it?  Just a matter of degree.
With regard to the napkin math... yes, it's napkin math, but I put in a little effort.  gold monetary base... 6.8T usd...
That's where I came up with 100k usd btc for monetary base parity (which would be 2.1T usd bitcoin monetary base, with a somewhat ballpark reduction flowing out of gold.
BTW, if world governments, particularly governments that claim to have gold but actually don't, get in front of the curve and buy up bitcoin (secretly of course and slowly), they could essentially steal a chunk of the gold value this way, from "slower / stodgy" goldbugs, and avoid or defer a gold default event if there is a "gold run on the bank."
Bitcoin might well be a way to keep the powers that be more or less in control, maintaining the status quo, if the PTB play their cards right.

Thanks for engaging in this discussion.  Glad you watched the movies, it tells me we can try to understand each other.


To me, this is speculating.  The devil is in the phrase "risk based basis."  What does this mean exactly? Some operating binder filled with math I suppose -- and is this public?  At the end of the day though, small risks can balloon into large risks in seeming violation of statistical properties. Because statistics are hard to get right, which was the underlying message of the movie Margin Call.


Here is a scenario.  Halsey's anti-bitcoin bias is transmitted to the risk management team, and Uphold tendency is to run a bitcoin deficit.  The bitcoin price makes a large upward move.  The Uphold risk management team thinks they are hedged because of their large dollar reserve.  But, when it's clear that the large btc move is potentially parabolic and they start buying bitcoin to cover, this pushes the price higher yet, in violation of their models.  (Granted the current net bitcoin deficit is currently not that big, but this is more to explain my thinking of what could go wrong rather than pointing a finger at something currently broken.)  Further, the Uphold model assumes bitcoin can be borrowed at low rates to cover "bank runs" but in a parabolic up move, rates also spike, and there are shortages of bitcoin available for shorting and other borrowing purposes, making this more difficult.  
In summary, my position is that Uphold should be two (decoupled) operations, a holding company with very small fees for holding (negative interest) and minimal risk (no trading risk, only counterparty risk) and a second company for trading (which pays positive interest).  It should be possible to invest in either operation, and the risk should be explicit.  That's just how it should work.
Further, the transparency page is great, but to my knowledge Uphold does not do merkle proof of reserves on its bitcoin assets, nor is it clear to me how this bitcoin is being held -- is it just on an exchange somewhere?  Perhaps you know more about this since you've done the due diligence, if so I would be interested to get the full story.
The merkle proofs apply to all crypto, so actually to voxel as well.  (I am unimpressed by voxel btw but that's irrelevant to discussion of overall risk profile.)
The fact that many exchanges don't do cryptographic proof of reserve doesn't excuse Uphold from doing this on their claimed crypto reserves, if indeed it is in a wallet where they control the privkeys.  And if it's not, there is again counterparty risk (hidden from depositors).  Some exchanges *are* starting to do proof of reserves, slowly and dragging their heels but it's happening.
Furthermore, even for the fiat (or the crypto if it is with third parties) there is another technical means for verifying funds, tlsnotary on cached web pages from the third party, that confirm funds availability.  Uphold isn't doing this either.  And neither is anyone else really, but again that doesn't excuse it.
In short, if Uphold really wants to be a paragon for a new model, they should at least pay lip service to crypto proof of reserves for their cold crypto assets, and tlsnotary for everything else.  They don't have to do be doing it actively, but they should at least put it on the road map.
But Halsey Minor is a bitcoin skeptic, and I suspect he is pretty firmly in the "old model" where funds are secured by the threat of arresting and ruining custodians if they cheat, but without real technical verification with teeth (crypto proof of reserve / tlsnotary).

it's a little more work to derive equivalentr functionality for ledger since you have to work with second factor cards, since no built in screen for pin.

True. But compromised nodes has relatively small impact currently, I think.
I guess there could be a super-sybil attack, or segmentation or... nothing that is really more than a nuisance and fixable.
I think with transition to segwit and more secure thin clients, the attacks get weaker still.
Again, not that the OP is wrong, but the issue is really node/miner compromise generally, not this specific attack.  And since nodes/miners are online with a large attack surface, I would expect some macroscopic proportion of nodes to be compromised at all times.  Bitcoin consensus needs to be resilient enough to deal with this reality.  And I think actually, it is

Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets have compatible bip39/bip44 seed phrases, and I'm pretty sure there are other HW with same, as the industry seems to be standardizing on this.  All hardware wallets include paper backup of seed phrase during setup.

Lindy and Thier don't guarantee bitcoin's success.  Unlike gold, bitcoin requires a continuous energy input (mining) for its security.  
When the block reward starts to dwindle in coming years, the shortfall will have to be made up with fees to secure the network.
Some people think the best way to do this is low volume, high fees (settlement).  Others think settlement fees only will be insufficient to secure the chain, and the block size will have to grow -- make it up on volume.
I don't know who is right.  But that is what is at stake.

That's a policy detail, and it's an interesting and important one. (I'm still thinking this stuff through.)
You could issue color coins as bearer tokens, where the recipient has full control and full responsibility, and could transfer to anyone.  This would of course go against the grain of current laws and regulations.
Or, you could state that if the tokens they are transferred without the stamp of approval of dell/sec, the transfer will not be honored. You could enforce this with multisig -- transfers require but user privkey and dell/sec privkeys for example.  
If the user loses privkey, the stock unit tied to this token could be "retired" and the stock re-issued under a new privkey.  You'd then have a database of "lost" stock id units, where colored coin tokens are no longer honored.  But then you lose some of the value of using colored coins in the first place.
With the multi sig above, you could "reissue" the token to a new user privkey, using dell+sec+other trusted backup keys.  Of course you cold also "take back" the token, if the backup key holders conspire. Scenario: the user is the wikileaks trust fund which has some stocks, and the gov decides that wikileaks doesn't deserve to be paid dividends.
There are a lot of interesting questions and wrinkles here.
The point of backing this with the bitcoin blockchain is the trust model and rules can actually be reflected and implemented with crypto rather than relying on a much more expensive court system to arbitrate when there are conflicts.
It's not necessarily about having a revolution, there are opportunities for efficiencies, saving costs, and saving time.

I'm sure it will be at some point, and given the cryptographic guarantee I can't imagine it not being eventually accepted as evidence.
Of course, a key factor with notaries is that a trusted party who does this for a living (the notary) actually witnessed something, so the end game here is probably notaries using this tech for digital documents that they have stamped with their own signature.

yes, there will be another large rise, but not for a while. (probably years)
My feeling is price follows "path of maximum pain."  That is, the path that will cause the greatest pain (mostly emotional pain and stress) to the most people, with pain proportional to percentage of net wealth invested.
A nice steady rise would be easy for HODLers to hodl.  If the early money never divested btc would be concentrated too much (much more than fiat) and the experiment would fail.  There needs to be periods of panic for long time holders to unwind.
Other market participants like volatility, know how to trade it either way. There needs to be periods of stability to shake them out too, so they get bored with the whale shenanigans and leave the market to fresh (and maybe more naive) money.
In short, expect the unexpected.
The feeling is percolating that we are maybe due for another megarise now.  So, that's what is not going to happen.
Unless it does ;)
To add more meat to this "delayed rise" hypothesis, institutional buyers with large budgets will play whale games, jerking the market to the upside and the downside using large fiat budgets as collateral for bitcoin short positions, cartel behavior, doing insider trading on exchanges they control or where they can spy on the order book, getting exchanges to allow fractional reserve for them ("cheat but don't get caught") and cheerfully pissing on the rule of law, not to mention arithmetic and sanity, to achieve buy in without a large run up in price.
To add to the fun, factor in that state rule enforcers and regulators will enforce unequally, where the institutioanal money is serving the interests of the state, which has its own agenda: price suppression, possibly an early grab for small sovereign wealth funds, and generally not letting crypto get entrenched until they are good and ready.
Market shenanigans will work for an unexpectedly long period of time, but eventually the bad exchanges will be shook out, and the short margins will be called in.
But not for a while.

First of all, don't panic, 99.9% you're fine.
Not an armory user, but from casual crypto scene following I don't think armory is dead, it is just in a transition phase.
Your plan looks good, but I would make one change to it.
Make a small (few pennies) test wallet, and do the backup and restore there first, to make sure you have all the steps right.
If it's a lot of bitcoin, make sure you do the signing on a computer that is "cold" -- known safe and not connected to the internet. If you don't know what that means, do a little research.
There is probably an armory community somewhere that can help you more.
For long term storage, I would start using a hardware wallet -- trezor or ledgerwallet, and there are some others that follow bip39/bip32 standards.  A recent article I wrote can maybe help you orient to hardware wallets:

I kind of agree, but I see another nuance to it.
By allowing to tokenize everything (using color or equivalent) bitcoin actually strengthens trust systems.  It helps to weed out bad actors, and it helps good actors evaluate how much trust they can safely place in each other.
For instance, the gold depository could commit to putting all material operational debts as publicly auditable tokens.  It could also submit itself to the rigors of multisig so it can't move tokens (gold bitcoin or other) without some super-trusted third party (think bitgo or even a government regulator) stamp of approval.
There is no silver bullet here if there is a total zomie apocalypse meltdown, but I think overall it could nudge existing systems in a healthy direction that maintain longer survivability by piggy backing on the trust inherent in bitcoin.

I love the noncustodial shapeshift model, so don't take this as criticism -- seeking understanding here.
My understanding is shapeshift allows small but not large tether transactions, precisely because large transactions might cause tether to reject the fiat conversion, resulting in an unhappy customer and general drama.
That is to say: shapeshift and other non-id-checking tether exchanges intentionally restrict tether volume to a greater extent than would be required given simple market demand, basically to avoid causing aml/kyc drama.
If the EU AML directive puts a greater squeeze on crypto token businesses, a potential outcome is that tether would reject fiat conversions for tether that passed through un-kycd addresses (like at shapeshift), and shapeshift would in turn cease to trade tether, or at least further restrict volume.
This despite neither tether nor shapeshift being EU based, but nobody wants to piss off interpol, I conjecture.
Does this represent a fair picture of the current state of tether trading?

So what this amounts to is a better backup then, where if a thief gets one piece of the backup this isn't enough for him to steal the loot. Or if one piece gets lost or destroyed, you can still access the funds.
That makes sense.

"Per sources close to the development, the platform issued 150 types of tokens that directly track the value of 150 traditional financial instruments, including shares of highly reputed firms like Apple Inc., as well as gold, oil and several other precious metals, and users of the system can seamlessly invest in these assets."
"directly track..." Looks like you're probably buying futures, like with whalepool.
"150 types of tokens" ... hmmm, is there a token play here somewhere? Hope not, it's useless and rife for shenanigans.

True, but:

I agree with what you said. However...
If you're using a hardware wallet, typing in the passphrase each time solves the problem of the hardware wallet cheating on the entropy.
If you're not using a hardware wallet, you're kind of already screwed on the "not having a keylogger on your signing device" angle. 
I recently was having a convo with u/dooglus about this that I am thinking of reopening.

What is the user supposed to do with just a seed? To use this to hodl, addresses are also needed, and then you are back to trusting something that programmers have created for calculating one or more addresses in the HD wallet.
Nice explainer project for what a seed is, but not useful for actually holding bitcoin safely.
TLDR if you are trying to figure out if this can help you hold bitcoin safely, it can't, just get a trezor and use a seed + passphrase.

It would be very similar to credit in a gold standard economy. And there certainly was credit there, back in the day. Though it was harder to get than now.
There would be "fractional reserve" in the sense that trusted banks would loan out more bitcoin (or gold) than is deposited, in exchange for paying their depositors an interest rate. 
One crucial difference in a bitcoin standard economy versus gold standard economy, is that with proof of reserve, it would be much more difficult to lie about how much is actually loaned out in such a fractional reserve scheme. So overall things would be more stable and boring.
Also bitcoin locked in multisig escrow accounts would be used universally as collateral in a wide variety of contexts.
@_date: 2019-01-10 13:52:10
That makes sense.
However, there is already a recommended way of addressing this issue, which is to use a user-controlled passphrase along with the hardware-wallet generated seed. The passphrase can have as much entropy as you like. 
So in terms of providing utility, I still see this more as an explainer than something for actual hodling.

Good idea, worth exploring.
Downside is cme/cboe still has almost as much security risk. The only difference between this scenario and normal bitcoin as collateral scenario is the hacker has to broadcast transaction first before he steals funds from cold wallet. So it’s really just adding more locks to the safe. You also save the transaction fee but that’s little money.
If you have an unbroadcasted transaction you are still a custodian and you need to understand how to safely store bitcoin.

Why didn't this pick up the problem in CVE-2019-12998 / CVE-2019-12999 / CVE-2019-13000 ? 
According to the writeup by rusty russell, this is indeed a bug in the spec.
"Discovery ---------  Rusty Russell (Blockstream) discovered this while working on protocol tests for the specification itself, as part of an ongoing effort to test multiple new proposed features add new complexities.\[6\]  The discovery occurred while writing tests for channel opening negotiation, in particular that invalid variants were rejected; while writing a test where the opener supplied an incorrect \`funding\_output\_index\` in the \`funding\_created\` message, he realized that it would not be rejected by the c-lightning implementation, which only checked the confirmation count of the \`funding\_txid\`, and not even whether the \`funding\_output\_index\` even existed!  This requirement was not mentioned in the specification, so Rusty immediately disclosed the problem the authors of the other most widely used implementations (eclair and lnd).  Their own investigations revealed that they were similarly vulnerable in limited circumstances. "

Looks like you weren't hacked, but locked yourself out.
Not a jaxx user, but have helped many people with wallet recoveries.
You probably wrote your seed down wrong. Go word by word. Look for where your handwriting is messy or ambiguous. Identify the words where transcription errors are more likely.
Then have a look at the bip39 word list / dictionary and for each word in your "mistakes candidates" look for the most likely word that it would correct to.
As a side note, bip39 wallets should give you an error ("impossible seed phrase" or like) if one of your words is wrong. Possibly jaxx doesn't do a good job of that. So it may be worth switching to a different wallet for the restore job.
Good time to get a hardware wallet.

Trezor is open source, there is a knockoff called bwallet.
review of bwallet from trezor (not a great review but informative):
or you could buy a ledger wallet with almost as much functionality
problem with ledger is no screen, so it's harder to defend against, eg, address substitution attacks or signing a transaction that steals all your bitcoin.  but for that cheap a price, it's certainly better than just running electrum with a password, which will get stolen the first time you get a computer virus.
because of the on-device screen, trezor is really the best option imho, for high value wallets.
for medium value wallets, ledger is ok.
i would only do low values without a hardware wallet at this point.  
UPDATE: Actually, did a little digging, and the problem with no screen isn't address substitution attacks.  Ledger protects against that pretty well.  
The problem is restoring from backup is insecure unless you are on a known good computer.  Which is a bit of an edge case.  
Still, I like that trezor has a screen.
Restore is exactly the kind of high stress / high emotion situation that you are likely to cut corners and screw something up.  The screen really helps in this instance.

Wallets that build on top of the same token are compatible simply by virtue of that.
So any wallets that are built using tokens from 
    -- open assets / colored coin
    -- or omni 
    -- or counterparty
will be compatible with other wallets that do same.
Open assets / coloring seems to have the most traction at the current time.
Seems like a pretty good solution to me.
To make it concrete, if google wallet and apple wallet both supported open assets tokens, and citibank issued a usd open asset token backed by citibank reserves, you would be able to send citi/usd tokens from google wallet to apple wallet, as easily as you could send bitcoin from mycelium to blockchain.info.
Tether/usd is an existing system that is built on top of omni, that is used for arb between polonix and bitfinex and a few other places.
To exchange omni and open asset based usd tokens would be a bit more work, but presumably it could be done on an exchange that supported both.
I guess we will see a lot of these types of systems coming onine in coming months and years.
There's a good interview about the coming fiat/crypto token wars at 
with patrick dugan, from the omni team.

Bitcoin is somewhat hamstrung by capacity now, it's true, and it is not a certainty that lightning roll out will be successful.  I think it probably will eventually be made to work.  But only time will tell.
I am sure there is someone at apple watching these things.  And I am equally sure they have no intention of discussing apple strategy with regards to bitcoin, as they never spill the beans on anything in history of the company, until they are good and ready.

seeds are generated on device.
in trezors case the seed words are displayed on the trezor screen.
in ledger's case the seed is leaked to a computer with screen so that needs to be secure. it's the only time seed is leaked. (at creation) iiuc.
ledger is pretty secure but this creation time leakage, which is necessary because ledger doesn't have its own display screen, is a reason why I prefer trezor to ledger among the ledger likes.
(of course this difference in form factor makes ledger nano a lot xcheaper)

if you are using coinapult to secure value in usd, they wouldn't need to hold your bitcoin keys any more than they need to in the mycelium case.
and/or copay could support shapeshift, which also doesn't keep keys. that has usdt, aka tether usd, which is a colored usd token built on mastercoin/omni and hence bitcoin m of n address compatible. 
the only drawback is I think shapeshift imposes a fairly strict limit on how much usdt you can buy.
I'm not sure if this limit is for kyc/aml/anti fraud, because liquidity is low, or both.

as lentilsoup said.
trezor-like hardware wallets don't leak privkeys.  They only sign transactions.
It's a much smaller attack surface, and single purpose.
If your main computer, where you have viewing wallet, is rootkitted, you could still fall victim to an address substitution attack.
But that limits losses to transactions you're tricked into signing.
But you won't lose all your privkeys, as you would if you got rooted on a computer that holds your privkeys.

they can tumble, buy fiat on localbitcoin or insure the value using coinapult or similar with no identity check.
saying this is too technical for lawyers (responding to other comments) is a cop out.  This is an adversarial situation.  Assuming your adversary won't use full spectrum of technology to accomplish goals (hide assets) just dilutes understanding and defers the magnitude of the cognitude shift.
bitcoin's like gold, that you can smuggle across borders, in your brain.
if someone is hiding assets and they know what they're doing, you need to block them from cashing out to bitcoin in the first place, or you need to be very aggressive about shaking them down once they have the coins.  dpr style aggressive.
even then you need to be realistic that you may get some back, but not all back.  Because plausible deniailiby / "sorry I lost the privkeys."
That's scary, for repo men and the lawyers who serve.  But it's the reality of the tech.
And that's only with what's possible now, with the current crappy tumbling.

The end game seems to be an arms race for control of tor endpoints.
If the NSA runs all tor exit nodes then bitcoin is no more fungible than at present. The NSA will always run some (unknown) proportion of exit nodes.
So fungibility of bitcoin is (unknown) measure of strength of individual non logging honest control over communication, against a "log everything" adversary that sybil attacks (or five dollar wrench attacks) honest communicators.
Take "NSA" above as a convenient representation of state or social desire for control over flow of information and identity of communicating parties. (All governments combined and collaborating if you will.)

I think the ideological turing test only makes sense for answering questions that are not in the factual realms, such as about religion.
I also think there's a presumption of good faith required. At least the people who you are trying to model aren't directly attacking your economic interests.
Would it make sense to try to fiture out an "ideological turing test" for a mugger who is actively smashing your head in before he steals your stuff, or if your country is being invaded or your people enslaved?
Why would you do this. It's just a way of sticking your head in the sand and going limp and passive while lettting your adversary wins because frankly, you have no balls.
Let me put this another way. If you are a typical hodler (most of us) letting miners centralize bitcoin will make you poorer and take power away from you and give it to the people whose code you are agreeing to run. If you are a minority who benefits from taking control of bitcoin (big miner, government or bank defending fiat institutions, eric voorhees), you will benefit. So which one a are you.

I think you meant "tor hidden service."
Thank you for pointing that out. I read up on this a bit more.
From the tor design paper: 
    We provide location-hiding for Bob by allowing him to
    advertise several onion routers (his introduction points) as
    contact points. He may do this on any robust efficient keyvalue
    lookup system with authenticated updates, such as a
    distributed hash table (DHT) like CFS [11].3 Alice, the client,
    chooses an OR as her rendezvous point. She connects to one
    of Bob’s introduction points, informs him of her rendezvous
    point, and then waits for him to connect to the rendezvous
    point. This extra level of indirection helps Bob’s introduction
    points avoid problems associated with serving unpopular
    files directly (for example, if Bob serves material that the introduction
    point’s community finds objectionable, or if Bob’s
    service tends to get attacked by network vandals). The extra
    level of indirection also allows Bob to respond to some
    requests and ignore others.
If the NSA is running the introduction points chosen by the hidden service, the NSA now knows the location of the hidden service.
So I think my original point stands, at least to some degree.

Basically there needs to be outreach from users to exchanges first, and other critical infrastructure following that. But exchnages are most critical.

If you're not trusting, you should buy. If you're trusting, you can rent.

Find someone with a hardware wallet, who is trustworthy. So they won't punk you by giving you a bugged hardware wallet. They wipe their wallet and rent it to you for a bit.
So you borrow it, initialize a wallet, record the 12 words and a passphrase and print the mpubkey or batch of first addresses. Wipe it, test that the backup works by performing a restore. Then you wipe it again and give it back. If you forget to do that, they are trustworthy so they wipe it for you and don't steal your funds. You can do this face to face too, to reduce chance of human error. Handholding.
Use this to hodl bitcoin. When you need to spend, you need to borrow the wallet again. Awkward, but better than "getting some sense of computer security."
A hardware wallet doesn't much more than a raspberry pi. Anyone that can afford a burner laptop can afford a hardware wallet. This needs to be burned into bitcoin culture.

I think there eventualy needs to be some financial incentive to be running a full node, analogous and perhaps complementary to the incentive for mining. (Most?) Miners would be full nodes as well, but perhaps there would be businesses that are only nodes and don't even attempt to mine. For want of a better word, we could call this transaction mining, or maybe transactioning foraging.
The idea is that FullNodes would gather transactions in batches, and sell these batches to miners who will pay them a cut of a block if they find it.
Possibly the batched transactions would be dark wallet tumbled transactions, but possibly there are other applications as well, such as
 
This is a little half baked Vycid, my point is that the future is in transaction processing, and maybe it hasn't been fully invented yet.
Also relevant: 
 (see bip22 and bip23 linked from there), from bip23:
"There is reasonable concerns about mining currently being too centralized on pools, and the amount of control these pools hold. By exposing the details of the block proposals to the miners, they are enabled to audit and possibly modify the block before hashing it."

The most efficient shipping today are 130nm 0.007KW/GH. With next gen 28nm asics, we could see a 10x increase in efficiency, to 0.0007KW/GH. I'll use the less efficient estimate for now, since that's what actually exists.
An hour of mining nets about 60 bitcoin.
Since we're miing at about a petahash now, an hour of mining is 1e6GH/s * 0.007KW/GH * 1 hour = 7000 KWH or 7 MWH.

My understanding is that mining becomes uneconomical on electricity costs alone at the current price, somewhere in the 60-80 petahash range. So I don't think it's realistic to forecast a petahash, unless prices rise over a thousand. 
I bought some more on the rumor, but I'm staying skeptical.
Would friedcat really go out on a limb like this?

I don't care about ecology. I mean, I do, but this is about making bitcoin a success.
I am concerned about physical limits, which are first experienced as economical limits, or put otherwise "feeling poor."
Block reward halves again in 2016.  If overinvested miners "feel poor" they will start switching their datacenters off.

I totally agree.
I like to study the  blockchain transactions though, for a number of reasons.
It's public and transparent.
More important, I believe Bitcoin will thrive or die based on what happens when block rewards decrease, most drastically in 2016. 
If there's an orgy of hardware spending to get that block reward, and then miner transaction fees don't at least show some glimmer of hope of replacing a macroscopic amount of minining revenue, mining operations will begin to have trouble paying the electric bill, and it will raise the specter of a 51% attack driving price down as well.
You can fake transaction volume if you're evil, but you probably don't want to be paying transaction fees on that. So transaction fees are a really good thing to pay attention to.
From what I can tell, transaction fees aren't going up the way I would like them to.
A lot of things could change that, starting of course with just better adoption, another big run up in price, and or loss of faith in fiat. 
Huge non-mining transactions and puny mining transactions won't work in the long term for bitcoin. We need to see transaction volume go up, and it needs to go up a lot.
Network deficit, the difference between transaction fees and costs to miners, is I think the key metric here.
According to blockchain it's only getting worse. Unfortunately blockchain info is tarnished because they use unrealistically bad numbers for cost of electricity and W/GH and $/GH. Still, the shape of the graph is evocative. I wish there was a place where I could view the "real" graph for this. I think it would look less dire, but still worrying.
So get all your friends using bitcoin by 2016! :)

He claims there is a hedging strategy, but he also explains (iirc in a bitcointalk thread) that he cannot explain what the hedging strategy is because this is 
a) proprietary
b) gives advantage to his competitors
That's reasonable enough, but it's appropriate to a prop trading fund, not a bank whose primary responsibility is to hold its depositors funds safe.

They are not the same thing. 
What they have in common is that both involve trust. You need to trust coinbase. You need to trust your hardware wallet lessor not to provide a tampered wallet.
But coinbase is supposed to have custody of your keys. Your hardware wallet lessor isn't. 
Coinbase is centralized.  An informal network of hardware wallet lessors is decentralized. 
Coinbase reports transactions to regulatory authorities. Your hardware wallet lessor shouldn't even know your addresses, if he's honest.
Coinbase is a  risk. Not your hardware wallet wallet lessor.

The best case scenario, with no cooling cost and 28 nm, is 0.7MW/PH. 
Seems low to me, but in any case still a lot. Hoover dam produces 2000 MW, so even at the low end our mega-mine is consuming 0.2% of power produced by the dam.
Just for fun, I updated the original post with a picture of the Hoover Dam and an estimate that 1 of these dams is an exahash of 28 nm gen 2. (With the higher estimate including a good chunk for cooling.)
I don't think we are going to see an exahash in 2014.

Sure, here’s my math.
Daily volume is about 20,000 btc, yields revenue 600 btc, monthly 18,000 btc, or 1.8 million usd if all converted.
So 5 million confiscated is about 2 months of revenue and change. That’s material.
Sure, MtGox has been around a lot longer than 2 months, but throw in some bad trading on their own book, and set asides for legal costs, and it isn’t so simple.
There’s a more depth at

I know that's what the data says, but it's hard for me to swallow 350k BTD/day in "real" transactions. Even counting things like drugs and gambling as real.
We know 10.5k is satoshi dice
but where's the rest of it coming from? 
3.6k is mining... ???
My current operating hypothesis is lots of little gambling sites, but according to the above article that still only covers 50%. Where's the other 50% coming from?
I am not sure if I trust the blockchain numbers for transaction volume. They admit it is an estimate and hand wave about an algorithm.
Judging from
which is not an estimate, it looks like about half the output volume. Is this reasonable? Yes, if you assume half of outputs is change. But is this really true? 
Putting on my tin foil hat, I am starting to wonder if some early adopters are just shifting large amounts of bitcoin between addresses they control, to keep the blockchain graphs looking the way they want them to.
I have been scratching my head over this quite a bit trying to understand better. 
UPDATE: Yet another source of shadow volume is bitcoin being moved around between accounts controlled by same person, but not for nefarious reasons. For example, cold wallet to hot wallet at the various exchanges and gambling sites, or exchange wallet to local wallet for users. I think it would be better to exclude this from the velocity of money calculation, but of course that's not so easy.

That equilibrium could be switching to a competing alt coin, not bitcoin.

So what do you think should be the social policy towards homeless people?
I think you probably will answer "lmao, not my problem, fuck them, lmao."

With room temperature functioning machinery I could maybe buy 1 cooling : 1 power, rather than the 2 cooling : 1 power estimate suggested to me by my data center savvy friend. 
There is lighting, there are fans. There is going to be some additional power overhead. 
It would also be good to add in rent and human overhead to get a full picture. Another day.

Totally true, and I am very bullish on bitcoin for the long term.
But to destroy Neo Bitcoin Bank, it only needs to tank long enough to spark a run on the bank. Even if it recovers later, the bank's reputation stays tarnished. Potentially bitcoin as a currency could get tarnished as well, although this is irrational.

It's more like, homeless people are deterred from begging in many neighborhoods, so they are a nuisance in the few places that tolerate them.
If it was a crime for police and security guards to harass homeless, you'd see them evenly spread out everywhere. Instead they congregate in the few places where there is a social conscience and people have the decency to help those who got the short end of the mental health or economic stick.
@_date: 2013-09-16 17:25:05
Oh, so it was you that came up with that. It stuck with me.
@_date: 2013-09-18 21:57:23
I see what you mean that a run on the bank isn't really a problem with your model.
The hedging strategy remains the risk point, for those with pegged accounts.
@_date: 2013-09-18 16:14:53
What I meant was the way it will actually work, not the way it's presented.
Winklevoss ETF: you deposit in dollars, the dollars are converted to bitcoin. If the value of bitcoin crashes, you lose.
LMB: You deposit in euros, the euros are converted to bitcoin. If the value of bitcoin crashes, you lose.

I think 60m is low, bitpay was reporting fast growth in march.
There is also a lively vps market (I'm fuzzy on numbers though), and it looks like porn content may tip in 2013-2014.
When there are debit cards that make easy btc to fiat spending, that may also be a sea change. CFIG for instance is working on this, and I think they're not the only one.
Overall it's a sputtering start, but I think not a dire as you say.
But then, I found it hard to swallow a million usd/btc also :)

That's pretty much it. CFIG plans to launch a bitcoin debit card as well.

I stand corrected.
My original point is unchanged though.
The question is what they do with the revenue once they get it.
@_date: 2013-09-08 00:00:30
Half the fee is in bitcoin, half in USD. And then the revenue is, possibly, traded on the open markets to achieve further gain, or to increase holdings in a currency which is required at a particular moment in time, such as to buy up an exchange (bitcoin) or to provide a rainy day fund for a lawsuit. And you can wind up on the wrong side of a trade.
@_date: 2013-09-16 06:51:32
You could power all of Las Vegas with 7000 MW, or 350 of your 747s. 
It's kind of baffling that you claim a 747 or an aircraft carrier (also mentioned in the link) as an inconsequential consumer of power.

People will be kidnapped / ransoms in bitcoin. If it doesn't happen for real, it will happen staged as a psyop.
Assasination pools.
The popular media will cry "IT HAS TO BE REGULATED"
I think we will see seeds planted about this fairly soon, but no serious action will occur prior to a major price increase. Governments/law enforcements are afraid of streisand effect. And bitcoin lobby may be effective behind the scenes.
It can't be banned (or rather, banning would backfire), but it can be harassed / coerced / tamed.
Government will not let currency devalue without a fight
there will be moral equivalent of capital controls.
We'll see something like it's illegal to use a bitcoin address that is not tied to your social security number. That will slow it down.
Tax on industrial mining, and regulations on what transactions miners can approve. Tax/regulation on mining means less mining, that means less security, easier to attack.
Also governments may require that miners only mine transaction for whitelisted addresses. Some countries will band together and require this from miners, and some miners will obey, and some won't.
This will fork the block chain.
It will get messy.
Finally we will see bitcoin competitors backed by fiat, and perhaps government gold reserves, and branded by visa/mastercard. And no fear of being harassed for using the "good" kind  of crypto. So this could present a credible competition and further slow the growth. 
But, I don't see any of this happening until well in the future -- 100k usd/btc.

I thought you were a troll but I guess you're serious.
Look, 
a) a lot of homeless are mentally ill, in many cases self medicating with drugs. They need physical safety and comfort to reduce their stress levels to the point where they can even start dealing with the mental issues. They need food and shelter a million times more than they need tough love. The shyster homeless that beg effectively for a living don't need your help, it's just a job for them (or a scam depending how you look at it) but the marginalized, truly addicted and mentally ill are in desperate need.
b) come on man, lighten up. It's christmas.
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:20:15
Is a good place to start for the history on this.
Mental illness and homelessness are very much linked. And many of the addicts are "self medicating."
And why are you so high and mighty against addiction? Some addicts are successful and high functioning, some non addicts are total losers. And it's impossible to judge who is addicted visually, an addict could fake you out if he is slick enough into being just a hard luck case.
Quit judging, start helping!
