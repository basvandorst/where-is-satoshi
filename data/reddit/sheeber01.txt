Because chances are it was not some crazy online hacker who did this it was likely someone close to you that your just overlooking or not considering. That usually the only way you can “hack” a trezor.

Sounds more like your physical seed was compromised. Did someone help you set up your device? Have you been around any new people lately?? Same thing happened to a friend of mine in 2017 at the peak of the bull run he thought it was something he did wrong with his trezor but it turned out to be the guy who helped him set up the device and told him a pass phrase wasn’t important who had his seed the entire time and when the account was big enough he took the entire thing. There’s probably a post from it on here back from December 2017.

Sounds more like your seed was compromised. Have you had any help setting up your device? Have you had any new people in your house lately? Someone with your seed can easily enter into a wallet like mycelium and have access to all your BTC holdings. The same thing happened to a friend of mine back in 2017 at the peak of the bull run. He had someone he trusted help him setup his device and the guy told him the pass phrase wasn’t important. Meanwhile he had a copy of the seed the entire time and when the account was big enough he took the entire thing. At first he thought it was a problem with trezor or something he had done online but turned out to be something much closer to home. Same guy has been doing this to other people as well. Maybe same thing happened to you.
