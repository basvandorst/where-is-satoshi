i used this one, you have to submit at a new hour (f.e. 08:00) because at 08:01 they will have reached their max for the hour.
my transcation ( was stuck for 4 days despites 100 satoshis/B and when i succesfully added it, it had 6 confirmation in one hour

You re absolutely right, I had them stored on Paymium ( its bad i know ) so i had just transfered them into my wallet. Could that be the problem ?

wat? I'm just posting this as information because "bitcoin-central" is based in France and I am French. I am not affiliated to them.
@_date: 2014-08-18 06:53:49
Though it would scale up. Thanks for the information

I am gonna talk about this to my CEO, I work in a languages school and we are looking for students from all over the world... This has many advantages for us I guess
@_date: 2014-08-18 06:53:02
Thank you. Those are words that a CEO wants to hear :)

I use multibit and it told me that the transaction was getting confirmed. It took approximatively 1 hour. Moreover, I received an email from bitpay telling me that i had received a payement for an expired invoice, cant reember the exact words so I m sure i did not fucked up at this part of the process
@_date: 2014-08-17 23:20:21
I tested the day BTC price went from 450 to 380 then 400 again etc..
@_date: 2014-08-18 06:48:52
Got it, thanks !
@_date: 2014-08-17 23:24:36
Thank you, i should have highlighted that all of this is new to me, I just hold and am very new to transactions. 
Can you please tell me how bitpay confirms that the product is bought ? Because I received 0 email, just one few hours later stating that an invoice was paid after expiration
@_date: 2014-08-18 10:44:04
Can anyone explain me why I got this email from bitpay when I bought my product: 
Partial Payment Received
An invoice has been partially paid but has expired. Because the invoice was not fully paid, it is not yet being processed. The following options are available:
Refund the partial payment (and try the payment again), or
Accept the reduced amount and mark the invoice as fully paid.
@_date: 2014-08-18 08:28:06
I dont understand why i didnt receive a confirmation email from bitpay
@_date: 2014-08-18 06:48:30
Thank you for the precision
@_date: 2014-08-17 23:14:11
I received nothing on my company email that i used when i created the account on bitpay.. 
And what should I say about the 4% "taxes" ?
@_date: 2014-08-18 06:52:09
This is why we are looking into bitcoin. But I guess I need to know much more before putting this option on our site

I was just happy that bitcoin is featured on French National TV. My parents and friends watched it and asked me questions about it. This is worth more than a blurred QR. 
The post was absolutely mind blowing, very high level stuff.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:53:35
i didnt even know about a French community. it will help me understand bitcoin on a deeper level in a easier way ! thank you
