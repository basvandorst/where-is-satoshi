It's funny how everyone waits until the very last minute! The writing has been on the wall many months ago and there are so many alternative exchanges and wallets where you could transfer your funds to. 
It's nice to be ahead of the average sheep holding their savings in fiat (especially from emerging markets), but what's the point if you're gonna loose your BTC in the end?
Rule  on online exchange keep only funds you're actively using to trade
Rule  in online wallet keep only funds you're going to spend in near future - like a real wallet. Just few hundred bucks
Rule  rest of your funds should be stored in addresses, where you and only have access to private keys - preferably properly generated paper wallets

Have you seen what happened? Ghash reached 51% - bunch of peoplegot unhappy and sold their coins - price plummeted - miners noticed and switched to different pool. 
In prisoners dilemma there is no feedback loop like here. Miners can mine in ghash until it reaches 100% but everyone would sell their coins in the meanwhile and those miners would be left empty handed. Not on their best interest.

Also there is a global demand for international internet money which will only be stronger over time. Now, I have no doubt developed countries like UK can overhaul their banking systems to be futuristic and up to date with split payments, real time settlement, peer-to-peer. But i see a great difficulty this being implemented in every country at the same time and while maintaining inter-compatibility for seamless transfer across borders. So this is where crypto comes in. Being state-less it’s one of its major features and individual central banks just can’t compete with that in any meaningful way. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:12:04
I get your points. But you're only reinforcing my point: your title is misleading as you don't really offer a 'bitcoin debit card'. Whoever chooses your card is back in fiat and it's effectively trading when topping up your prepaid card. While on the true bitcoin debit cards it's more like cost averaging because you don't really check the price everytime you pay in store. 
Like I said, I absolutely have no beef with you and the other prepaid cards (that can be topped up with bitcoin). I am just saying they are really not comparable to cards that convert bitcoin to fiat at the moment of purchase. So it's like comparing apples and oranges. That's what I find deceitful in these comparison tables. I am pretty sure you might have the best and cheapest top-up card but it's not debit card per-se. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:47:36
It's bullshit. The only true Bitcoin debit cards (as mentioned in title) are Xapo and Shift (where is that one mentioned in your comparison?) as they directly debit from your Bitcoin balance. They may have higher fees but you're effectively hodling bitcoin until the very last second before purchase and you're exposed (benefiting) from bitcoin price raises. This is the only way for a true bitcoin hodler. 
All the other cards are just regular prepaid cards that can be topped up with bitcoin. You can do that by selling on exchange and topping up any other prepaid card. Nothing interesting to see there. 
As much as I support innovative bitcoin companies, Afaik this is just Bitwala shill post for a product completely different from Xapo offering.

Hey... I feel sorry for you. I don't wanna be ass or anything, but in the end it is your responsibility to take good care of your coins. You wanna stick with services that at least claim they keep most of the user's funds in cold storage! 
Did they listed who the owners of the exchange were? Real names of persons behind it? Did they have some venture capital backing? How old was this exchange?
If you have a bit of doubt about the service, just keep bare minimum in there. Everything else in your own cold storage. Transfer to the exchange only when needed to minimize the risk.

@_date: 2013-12-02 19:35:06
Just listened to the whole show. And yesterday I listened to the one on Ed &amp; Edan's
I had a respect for Peter before there was bitcoin. There was no other viable alternative to rotten fiat other than coming back to hard asset backed currencies. 
But when Bitcoin was invented, this changed everything. There are old people who don't get it because their minds are wired up different way. One of them is Peter. He is probably too old to have sufficient abstract thinking capabilities. 
There have been some forward thinking Austrian economists who saw the light decades ago before the the technology existed. And now it's here. 
Value is subjective. Consensus on value creates market and money. There doesn't have to be anything physical behind money. Just strictly enforced rules. 
Because people are easily corruptible, they first pegged currency to hard assets like gold so no one can fake it. The properties and distribution of the physical asset itself enforced the rules. But the bankers found a way around this. And the people fell for it at least for 100 years. 
Now the rules are enforced by cryptographically protected algorithm. No room for corrupt humans to get around the rules. Rules based on physical properties is just outdated concept in the world of information technology. 
Value is just human imagination and doesn't have to be tied to physical crap. 
Welcome to the now! Bitcoin is the next step in evolution of money and gold is the past. Get over if Peter.

Why would you scan a private key with app like that?
If you're talking about paper wallet, your private key should be covered with something in the first place (paper fold) so cameras around you can't take picture of it. 
Or encoded. See bitaddress.org

If you're new to Bitcoin, I would definitely recommend keeping your funds in Coinbase account first. Make sure to enable 2-factor auth!!!!!
After you get more familiar with bitcoin and surrounding security practices, then you can create encrypted paper wallet and transfer your holdings there.
Do not transfer your bitcoins out of Coinbase account to any software client/wallet if you use Windows! They are much safer in the cloud than on your average Windows machine.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:31:27
Are you the new Dread Pirate Roberts?
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:00:53
I am not sure if I understand your questing but I will try to answer it anyway. 
1. Just download Coinbase app on your smartphone/tablet (android or iOS)
2. Make account within the app. 
3. Get someone to send you a dollar!
4. Profit!!
If you like it, log in on your computer and set up 2factor authentication before buying more Bitcoins!

In the other Schiff vs. Voorhees topic I brought up how older generations have harder time understanding abstract concepts while younger people don't. There is a TED talk on this topic

@_date: 2013-12-02 20:27:19
Btw. I briefly mentioned that some old people doesn't have enough abstract thinking. 
There is good TED talk on this topic. It's called something like "are we smarter than our grandparents?" 
Speaker argues that people who didn't grow up around computers and information technology have harder time understanding abstract concepts (like bitcoin, dollars backed by debt, computer memory, etc.). That doesn't mean they are less intelligent than younger generation. But their brain is wired different way very much connected to physical things (like gold). 
Peter seems like to be one of them.

I am not saying digital representation of gold is a bad idea. Quite the opposite. There is not a problem with competing monies.

@_date: 2013-11-18 01:20:51
That's the risk of saving in fiat! Fiat is not money... it's just a currency. So it's not very good way to save. If he bought any physical asset with his fiat, he would be much better of when we switch over to bitcoin. He is not gonna get richer when holding physical assets, but he won't loose either!
It's dumb to hold PAPER assets as SAVINGS! 
It works in times of money printing. But in a long term is very BAD idea.
So the wealth shift will only be from fiat holders to bitcoin holders. Everyone else will be just fine!!!!!

Events like this cast bad light on Bitcoin in the eyes of "normal" people. It gives government/law-enforcement them extra work and they will try to regulate/outlaw it as much as they can, so they don't have to deal with this shit. 
That's why developers have to take security seriously and users have to be careful where they keep their coins!

What? What's the difference if he has it in one address or many? 
His final addresses are know since the guy tracked the coins thru tumbler. 
As long as he has the money on address that the original owners can't reach he is safe. Then he can take his time to come up with plan how to distribute the coins to different addresses without drama.

You can probably issue gold-backed IOUs on Ripple network and that could serve as digital form of gold. But the counter party risk is a problem.

So the money to Gox came pretty fast. I was pleasantly surprised. 
I also found out BitStamp accepts AstroPay as well. 
So I went to try it and had no luck. When redirected to AstroPay website, there was a form to fill out (not the case with Gox) and the form kept saying my name, DOB and ID number is not correct. So I was not able to get past to form. Anyone was successful on Bistamp?

Now you have a lot of government paper thou. Enjoy. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:59:53
It does. 
But there are multiple issuers of IOUs even within one jurisdiction. If one defaults on the holdings everything still goes as normal. 
It encourages depositors to be careful with their deposits. Unlike state/central bank issued and insured dollars. 
It brings back the old system Peter seems love so much where each bank issued it's own notes. 
It's just digital representation of old concept and some people are genuinely excited about it because it's less controversial than say bitcoin. 
I see it as viable competitor. Why not have digital IOUs backed by gold used as currency. It's definitely an improvement over Gold ETF for example. You can use it for trading and as a currency because of the underlaying payment network. 
But it's still no comparison to bitcoin. Bitcoin is new, it's fresh, it's revolutionary. 
No counter party risk for the win!

Yeah! Cool. I have fixed my English a bit. But you got my point. 
I just tip people who are genuinely interested. Kinda like here in reddit but usually they coinbase mobile app. It's the fastest way to get them started. And I guess it's more secure than their average windows computer. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:42:12
Yes and yes!
As I said in another comment, future of bitcoin in its current is still questionable. It's too early to tell. 
But the ideas behind it are here to stay. They fit exactly with Austrian economics and with common sense. 
Bitcoin is just first implementation of those ideas. Maybe there is a security flaw waiting to be exploited. Maybe it can be fixed or not. 
Maybe there will be new coin down the road. 
Bitcoin rules are based on math and protected by math. Math is a way to go. 
Maybe with quantum computer and new state of matter, this won't be the case anymore but for now were good. Gold can also be imported from outer space, but haven't been even to Mars yet so we are not worried about that either.

I wouldn't say 95% but I can imagine there will be significant drop as bitcoin gets understood by large gold holders. 
Gold is pretty useless as form of currency these days. It being used as store of value and if bitcoin (as currency) gains wider adoption, I don't see reason why not transfer big chunk of your gold holdings into bitcoin. The deflationary aspect with predetermined limit is way to go. With gold you never know how much of it is it out there.... hidden in nature, governments, space.

Also bit of deflation happens when someone permanently lost private keys with balance larger than 0. 
But I assume this is not happening faster than new coins being mined. So price rise cannot be attributed to deflation just yet. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:27:24
Exactly. This is free market at its best. 
No arbitrary trading halts from central point. No one "saving" the economy. The more exchanges the better.

This is exactly how fractional reserve banking was created. 
You gave someone your hard assets and they gave you notes. 
No one ever checked if there is enough gold for the notes in circulation. And when they did, they refused to give up the gold. 
Why would this time be different? 
Peter Schiff is holding onto idea that's already proven flawed and that renders him irrelevant. It's like someone still arguing communism is great. While the underlaying principle is somewhat noble, it just can't work in real world. It's been proven again and again. And the same goes for hard asset backed currencies.

I call bullshit on that. If that is gonna happen at some point, bitcoin will be developed enough to just take over broken financial system. 
Don't forget bitcoin is not only currency but also payment infrastructure. It can also be issued in physical form by trusted 3rd party which solves the use in area where population is not tech savvy enough or doesn't have internet.

Gold was the best thing nature could offer to be used as money before the electricity was discovered and utilized for transfer of information. We loved gold back then as a species. 
Then came the time when information could be moved around at almost the speed of light. So the moving value had to keep the pace. Gold was deposited and in safes and all you needed to move was the information about the gold. 
This was so much better than moving around physical gold that people just switched over to this new system. 
And then came around some really smart people (politicians and bankers) and they saw no one (or at least the majority) really cared if the gold was there. All we needed to move around was the idea of value. 
And they defrauded us. Now we are back. There is no coming back to gold as currency. 
It could still be used as store of value like any other physical asset which doesn't spoil over time. But that's about it. 
I predict value of gold going down over time. Who needs gold anymore? It's really pretty to make jewelry, but there is jewelry imitating gold/silver and people are happy. 
For use in electronics, there are many cheaper alternatives for most use cases. 
I am not by any means arguing that gold is useless or doesn't have any value. I myself hold few coins for fun and because they are pretty. 
But gold as currency is not coming back and closed minded people like Peter Schiff who are wrong and delusional. 
The price of gold is right. It's based on supply and demand. Gold is neither undervalued or overvalued. Maybe someone's manipulating the price but there is nothing you can do about it. 
All you can do is get rid of your gold if it's not performing as store of value and switch to something else. Maybe bitcoin, but that's everyone's own decision. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 13:37:07
