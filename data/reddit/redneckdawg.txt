We don't tax capital gains on bitcoin, but income tax is applicable if you sell services or goods for bitcoin.

Portugal: Capital gains on bitcoin and cryptos aren't taxed here.
You only pay taxes if you receive cryptos as a payment or if your professional activity is related to mining/trading.

One of dozens. That's aimed at foreigners and I haven't checked it, but I suppose so are the prices.
You may want to check  (real estate portal), Remax Portugal website, Era website, Century21, etc. There are hundreds of real estate agencies nowadays. The ones I mentioned are the most widely used by portuguese as they operate on a national scale.
However, if you're looking for luxury villas or condos, you may find more adequate listings in agencies such as Sotheby's or any other Portuguese agencies ained at this market segment. If this is the case I can check a few and come back to you with some names.
I don't know what's your plan, but Lisbon and Porto are no longer off the beaten path places. Although the country is small, you have plenty of choice if you are not looking to move to a big city. There are plenty of medium sized cities to small towns that may also be very interesting options. ��

There's a project for that but it's got its own token. Look up Maecenas, (ticker: ART).

"Reportedly" is the keyword here. I'll translate that for you: We are just making this shit up, we have no idea what is going on.
