Greetings from Rochester, NY!
I think things will work out. From everything I've seen, Gox just has the worst public relations disasters going on atm. Obviously they have problems, but I think they will sort it out eventually...
That being said, I've been buying Gox coins. I know that's a risk, but one I'm willing to take at the price.

This is awesome! Was searching high and low for bitcoin taking online cigar retailers earlier this year, especially when the price was at 1k ;) , great news! Will be making a bitcoin purchase soon. 
Now, any idea if you guys will ever consider taking litecoin?

It's a digital currency not unlike bitcoin. If I wasn't on my phone I would post some relevant info. 
It does my have as much support as bitcoin does though. I would certainly push bitcoin before litecoin however, and once you guys become familiar maybe think about it then. 
In any case, truly excited about this news. I would cross post on r/bitcoin

Lots of people are buying, that 9k sell wall is getting eaten away. Now is a great time to buy.

Love all this fear-mongering, keep bringing those prices down fellas.

I don't know what Mt. Gox is doing to ensure everyone that everything is okay. Honestly it's quite the opposite.
That being said, I'm buying either way. Both on btcbuilder and on other exchanges.

Yeah, I'm basically on planning on buying all my christmas presents as well using the btc I've made through gyft

I've been spending and buying throughout this Bitcoin run. While my inclination is to horde it, I also believe in the importance of using BTC for what it is, a viable currency.
Furthermore, I've been able to buy things from friends and give them their first BTC, which has made me proud. :)
