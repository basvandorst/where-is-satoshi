9 years ago, I discovered bitcoin's existence and did nothing other than observing it. Never thought I wanted a time machine this badly.
Edit: Holy shit the replies, look at all the people on the same boat ~~because it could have been a yacht~~.
Short story: 
I've never thought bitcoin could be this *big* in economical success before its actual success purpose of use. 
As a programmer, I treated it as one of the many many open sourced project I've seen, and be intrigued by the technology as a normal tuesday to me.
So as usual, I just wait and see in few years we can adapt this technology and use in daily lives like many lifespan of a successful project. 
It turns out half way, we are here buying, trading, and waiting to moon before I can walk in to mcdonald to get a happymeal with my coins.

generally, conferences should have one language to be decided to be used as 'main' language of communication, and most of the time it is English.
