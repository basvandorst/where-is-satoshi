If I remember right he said that Bitcoin on LN can only support around 500m users. Litecoin using ln could then support 2 billion users. There is still a need for more than just bitclon and litecoin but I really do believe that these two will be the main 2.

With 2mb blocks bitcoin on LN will support over 200 million active users, considering the avg user commits back to the blockchain will be once a year.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:37:55
Even if everyone kept there funds on a channel for about 1 year bitcoin can only support 130,000,000 active users. How often do you can to keep your funds off chain? A week, a month, a year? Eventually, we will need alts. Atomic swaps are so important for crypto currency to scale to a global payment network.

It will be your choice how you want store your funds. How often you want to commit back to the block chain is up to the user. The more often users close a channel and commit back to the block chain the more fees will rise just like today. As fees rise the less often users will want to commit back to the blockchain. On channel TX will be tiny compare to the tx of closing a channel. The market will force everyone on layer 2 technologies. Once layer 2 technology matures users won't want to move back to the blockchain because of the cost of fees and because everyone will be using layer 2. This is just a theory based on the best case scenario of layer 2. I am still skeptical ln will even work but I also believe that we can't scale for the world on blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:35:06
High fees will force us to use layer 2 technologies like lighting network, once/if they come out. If all the tx on chain were cheap why move to layer 2. Core has designed it this way. I really hope the ln comes soon.

Litecoin is not a scam. Just because the creator sold his small share of coins doesn't mean anything about the tech. All it will do is allow for more fud and speculation. Bitcoin maximalist think that Bitcoin is the only crypto worth keeping and all other coins are scams. Not everything is a scam and litecoin is not a scam.
@_date: 2018-08-29 07:27:06
I wish Satoshi would come back and sell all this coins he mined just to prove that what the creator does with his/her coins doesn't matter in this space over the long term. It shouldn't matter the reason if the tech is sound. Since litecoin is very similar to Bitcoin then it will stand the test of time just like Bitcoin. This is crypto and not a stock in a company.

Honestly, I think its better for Litecoin in the long run if Charlie is less involved in the coin. A coin success long term should not be defined by the creator of the coin as if it were a founder of a company.
Like it or not Litecoin will be apart of the lightning network. Some including myself believe that Litecoins could provide even cheaper routes on the lightning network. Multiple atomic swaps with litecoin and bitcoin could provide these cheaper routes. Additionally, it will also be cheaper to open and close a payment channel with litecoin. Instead of refilling in BTC we could refill in ltc and run an atomic swap to swap to BTC. 
If the lightning network needs to scale for global demand I would rather use more capacity though alt coins with a blockchain that mirrors bitcoin instead of a block size increase.

Why would a miner mine empty blocks? If there an incentive not to add tx to a block? The mining reward is still much larger than the fees from the tx in the block but over a long period of time the fees will become the larger reward. Mining empty block pays less than mining full blocks so even if it does happen over time it should happen less and less.

There are market patterns. Or at-least there are market patterns that traders look for. I sometimes wonder if these patterns speculators look for are like a self fulfilling prophecy.

Gold will always have inflation but it is unknown to how much inflation will be in the future. Golds inflation is somewhere between 1% and 2% a year. Bitcoin's inflation rate is know and will decrease to zero in about 100 years. Bitcoin inflation rate right now is 3.91%. The next halving will drop this to 1.8% and &lt;1% after that.

Just depends if BTC breaks the $6000 floor or breaks the $9500 ceiling in the coming month or so. If BTC breaks the current floor then we may have to revisit the long term floor of around $4000.   Based on previous trends the lowest floor at end of year would be $6500. 
Worst case in my mind is that BTC will be bear till end year and hit the long term floor. 2019 will be a slow grow to $20k, then the bulls come out in 2020.

I doubt that individuals would prefer bitcoin to cash for under the table work as most of this work would be low income. These people need liquidity for the now and by the end of the month and not savings for the future. Right now Bitcoin is too volatile to being paid in Bitcoin and use it as a currency out right. However to be less volatile we need the liquidity. It's a total chicken vs the egg problem that will take a long time to equalize.

It's not about being honest. Humans are suseptable to greed and Bitcoin security model revolves around that greed. Proof of work uses electricity kind of a like a deposit. Let's say you have a huge mining operation and you use 100k in electricity a day. If miners play by the rules of bitcoin then you will be rewarded with bitcoin. You can predict what your profits will be based on costs of electricity, hash rate, current/future network difficulty, and the price of btc. If miners try to cheat then the work(electricity) will be forfeit. No matter how rich these miners are there will always be an incentive to play by the rules.

I completely agree. Being better is subjective and is most likely a trade off feature for feature.

If the price wasn't so volatile then sending the exchange value wouldn't be so terrible. The biggest thing I think we can do is to start preferring to be paid/owed in Bitcoin.

I think LN is going to be very massive for Bitcoin over time. In the future I think the 1mb blocks will be bottleneck for the number of users who can use close and open channels on LN. I think alt coins like litecoin will be a way for more users to open and close channels. Bitcoin can only support 200m active users on ln. Litecoin can support 4x as many. I think we are about 10-15 years away from this becoming a problem. I know Bitcoin will be on top but it will need other chains for ln to work on a global scale.

Bitcoin miner's are rewarded more by using the cheapest source of power. Use of this power is pretty crucial to the security of the Bitcoin. This is what proof of work is all about. No matter how much Bitcoin miner's use Bitcoin will still be around. Mining hardware efficiency, hardware cost, cost per watt, price of coin, mining reward, and mining fees are all the variables miner's have to work around. Overtime the price will go up and flaten if git becomes gloablly adopted but mining reward will go down. If the price doesn't go up from this then profit margins will change. That could lead to a decrease in hash rate on the network. It's hard to say what when happen long term. I choose to believe that mining will force and fund innovations in cheaper electricity. I just hope that comes with a lower carbon footprint.

Get a 401k loan. Take only what you can afford to lose.. Be prepared to lose 80% of your investment but hold though it if the worst happens.  I did this through 2018 when I bought bitcoin at 6500.  Bitcoin is rising but there will be consolidation. There is still a small possibility that this is not the next bull market and could come back down to 3000.  Long term I think it will rise to new ath but I think the market is going up too fast and too many people are afraid to short. Greed will change that as bulls take profits.

Bitcoin is the alternative to the fraction reserve banking system. If the debt defaults then it's a likely that users of that system will move to an alternative.

I was curious too. This is what they list on their website. Coinbase and Dwolla currently charge no transaction fees. Both companies reserve the right to create a per transaction fee in the future.
Shift's cardholder agreement allows Shift to charge the fees listed below.
Plastic Card Issuance Fee: 	$20.00
Domestic Cash Withdrawal Fee (applies to both ATM and Over The Counter “OTC” withdrawals): 	$2.50 (per transaction)
International Cash Withdrawal Fee* (applies to both ATM and Over The Counter “OTC” withdrawals): 	$3.50 (per transaction)
International Transaction Fee*: 	3% of total* (per transaction)
Card Replacement Fee: 	$10.00 (per Card issued)

I would say that in 50-100 years crypto will replace fiat. Bitcoin may be the most dominant coin in the future but it will not be alone. There will be thousand of coins like there are today. In 10 years Bitcoin may be the preferred currency but it won't replace fiat like you said.

I agree with them if we choose to look at Bitcoin as a commodity and not a currency. If Bitcoin is treated mainly as a store of value then I can understand why they would think that this is not a good investment compared to other assets. The only way to earn more is find someone who wants to pay more than what you paid for. It's pure speculation... It's as if they ignore that Bitcoin is a currency. Until Bitcoin is widely used as such these types will never see what we see.

Based on the long term logarithmic trend line for previous bottoms, Bitcoin has yet to reach the true bottom. Right now that bottom is around $4500. End of year is around $6000. I don't think we will see sub $6000 again however I don't think we will have a big breakout bull run until Bitcoin bounces from this line again.
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:04:13
I understand your point that nobody knows where the market is going but I feel more convenient that it will hit $6000 vs going down to $1000.

I really didn't give it much thought before the launch about how successful bakkt will be. Services like these always take time to build clientele. It was over hyped for a whole year. Honestly, the dip is a good opportunity to buy more Bitcoin. Long term is what matters in this space. In 5 years bakkt may or might not be huge but I am confident that bitcoin will be worth more than it is now.

Smart phones generally are more secure than laptops because of the software on top. Most user run their laptop and desktops in admin/root. If you give software root access then the device is not secure.  Smartphones are more locked down. Most users don't have root access to their phones so there is no way to give root access to a rouge application. That being said you still have to trust the hardware and it doesn't matter what you have because it's always a risk.

Greshams law suggests that good money becomes scarce and less used. Why?  Is it because owners of good money want to hold onto value or is it because when something is more scare it becomes hard to divide and keep account of.
Has there been  any other money of value that would be considered "good money" and be easily divisible as bitcoin? If mirco-payments are as convenient or more convenient than fiat then bitcoin may become more than just a store of value. It might have the properties of good money but might be used as liquid as bad money. Only time will tell.

Lightning network for Bitcoin can only support 100m-200m users with the current 1mb blocks. Litecoin currently can allow 4x the users to become part of the lightning network. Atomic swaps will make it very easy to switch between Litecoin and Bitcoin. How many years in the future we will need the capacity for Litecoin to get on the Lightning Network.

If you are trading you will pay nearly twice as much in taxes than your father. Long term tax rate for him would probably be around 15% while short term is around 25% but it will depend on your income levels. You have to trade up around 12% of your orginal buy in just to break even. Good luck.

My estimate is $18k -$50k. I think it will slowly rise to around $25k or so. I want stable movement upwards.  It may peak to $50k if the bulls come out. It's had to say where it will be and how it got there by end of the year. I think that btc has hit it's bottom but we might just hit it again.

I think service based companies that adopt the lightning Network for streamed payments will be the first employers to have streamed paychecked to it's employees. Salary employees would be easily to adjust but hourly would be more difficult.  When it comes to product based companies the only way to stream payments would be though a delayed stream. Stream payments would literally flowing cash. If you are not getting a stream in you won't want to stream out.

When the lightning Network matures, it could change the way we think about money entirely. The uses of lightning are much more interesting to me than blockchain.

There are three outcomes over the next few months. BTC could go up, BTC could go down, or BTC could stay the nearly the same. Doesn't matter to me what way the price goes over the next few months. I rather it go down so I can buy more month to month. I hope for a slow climb to 18k by the end of the year. I really don't want to see 50k this year. I want to buy as much as I can now while the coins are cheaper.
