It would probably have to be based outside the U.S., Coinbase isn't asking for their own enjoyment it's just KYC/AML law they have to follow.

The 1st rule of avoiding fees club is don't go on social media and tell people about avoiding fees club. If they see tons of people saving money they'll just add a fee.

Buy BTC, but not right now. Wait for it to go down first.

Gemini, Kraken, LocalBitcoins, etc. I have to cash out bitcoins regularly via ACH so what I care most about is fees. Loved Circle, now using Gemini because it's around 0.6% all said and done between BTC deposit and bank account. I used Coinbase before Circle with no issues but once they raised their fee to 1.5% I bailed out of there.

Yep, and it's too bad too. I loved their site, easy to use and no fees.
To OP: You can still use Coinbase with a PayPal Debit card but with something like 4% fees.

Gemini is great, I had no problem with them at all until they raised their fees. That's when I made the mistake of looking to GDAX and their low fees :(

Been using Gemini ever since Circle dropped BTC support so long ago, signed up for Coinbase to get the lower GDAX fees after Gemini raised their fees.

Account restricted issues. Signed up &amp; did full Level 3 verification, the second I deposited BTC "Account Restricted" and can't buy/sell/withdraw. Signed up right after Gemini raised their fees to get the lower GDAX fees.

1. I doubt they'd ever see this in the 1st place so I'm not really asking them for anything, this isn't even in r/Coinbase.
2. Even though this contradicts  a bit I'm talking to their upper management here, not the support staff. I'm sure the support staff do the best they can and have no control over the higher ups not hiring enough people or doing whatever they need to do to get things on track.

Nope nothing illegal/immoral/questionable.

Last I checked Kraken had high withdrawal fees unfortunately. I tried signing up with them probably the 1st week or 2 they were open, even before they supported my state :)

PayPal is too easy to reverse and they nearly always side with the buyer regardless of evidence. If you must use PayPal get a PayPal debit card and use Circle :)

Just make sure you get it from their actual site since there was a fake BF sale last year for TREZORs.

In your biggest markets open local merchant accounts + bank accounts + Bitcoin exchange accounts. Use exchange's API to buy Bitcoin with local bank account and send Bitcoin to your UK Bitcoin exchange. Use UK Bitcoin exchange's API to sell coins to your bank account.
A nuisance to set up but works, just depends on how big your company is if it's worth the set up time + cost.

The fee market sucks and always has, such a waste of BTC compared to just having a realistic block size and paying 0.0001 BTC per TX.
