Yeah. Some people don't understand the responsibility that comes with a living, breathing pet. I think it would also really help to educate the public about neutering their dogs or at least keeping their dogs from getting pregnant. Cause imagine if your dog at home gets pregnant and has a bunch of puppies and you can't find homes for them or take care of them yourself so you take them to the shelter.
Also it's not just bad people who can't take care of their dogs that end up in shelters. Some people die, some people face disasters, who knows. It's just unethical to keep supporting puppy mills.

Paying for a rescue is very cheap and the payment is for their vaccinations and such before they give you the dog. So no, it's considered adoption, not "buying".

No, I never said that.

That wasn't an argument. The mills would be shut down and the impregnating of dogs to be bred for them would stop. The dogs currently in the mill could be sold for low adoption fees by the organization putting an end to mills. Or, the mill would be forced to sell its last set of dogs at their price of choosing. Those specially bred mill dogs would be bought by the public fairy quickly. Then, there would be an end to the mill cycle. Shelters are flooded with abandoned animals who get euthanized daily and that is the ethical issue at hand.

Yes, because it creates demand. The more puppies you buy from these mall stores and puppy mills, the more business it will generate to keep breeding these dogs for large amounts of money when there are so many doggos who don't get adopted and then euthanized every day in the shelters :(
