We've got blockchain, and we'll see how to go about it. Several people here wrote and have presented with positive suggestions and answered our questions.
I think we have got some heavy reading up to do, which we will do soon. Bitcoin seems such a powerful currency, without international transfer hassles and so on.

How much is too much?

We will comment just on one point:
Don't know about post-Soviet countries, but in Ukraine, all orphanages are not strictly state-regulated. There are different regulations depending upon different kind of licenses that they have, and primary duty of the state is to see that they are:
- Properly serving food, high standards and nutrition
- Cleanliness and sanitation
- Doing their best to provide best environment to the children
Often certain officials might inspect and monitor, frequency of which, again, depends upon licenses. 
We encourage you read this before blurting out blatant cynicism:


     1.4.1. Будинки-інтернати I  профілю  для  дітей  з  фізичними 
вадами і нормальним інтелектом дошкільного та шкільного віку,  для 
яких самостійне пересування є значно  утрудненим  або  неможливим, 
які частково себе обслуговують (змішані за статтю).
     1.4.2. Будинки-інтернати,  де можуть одночасно функціонувати:
     - відділення  II  профілю  -  для  дітей з глибокою розумовою 
відсталістю,  які можуть самостійно пересуватись і обслуговуватись 
(розділені за статтю);
     - відділення III профілю - для  дітей  з  глибокою  розумовою 
відсталістю,  які  можуть  самостійно  пересуватись  і  не  можуть 
самостійно обслуговуватись (розділені за статтю);
     - відділення IV профілю - для дітей різного ступеня розумової 
відсталості,  які мають складні фізичні вади, не можуть самостійно 
пересуватись та самообслуговуватись (змішані за статтю). 
On everything else have addressed you previously as well, and while we respect some cynicism, despite providing proofs etc., you are bound on demeaning us.
Hence we will ignore.

Thanks :)

Thank you...

You are honest about spreading hatred if so.


Show where we did that?
We end our communication with you here. 
All proof is on the album anybody who desires to ask further information can pm and we'll gladly answer them.
@_date: 2014-08-01 10:50:26
Thank you...
We hope community here can push us nearer to our goal
@_date: 2014-08-01 10:13:12
...Why not, become a patron or orphanage patron? :)
@_date: 2014-08-01 14:07:19
Sure, we'll do it...
Where do you think we should do it - Politics &amp; Society section or Bitcoin discussion?
@_date: 2014-08-01 00:18:37
@_date: 2014-08-01 01:16:41
Well, we do not have a website yet, but since one gentleman from Australia offered us to make one, I think we can do that. 
Bitcoin100 looks really interesting. Thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2014-08-01 01:15:04
Actually we did explain, in case you didn't pay attention.


May I ask you where are you from, and from where did you form this opinion?
Because if this is the kind of expert opinion you've formed just by reading news, then we have nothing to say.
There are lots of such flags here, and they are not only flown by Svoboda - they've a long history behind them. 
They are generally popular in the West but it's not so abnormal to find them here. We'd prefer if you visit the country and then look for yourself.
@_date: 2014-08-01 16:36:29
Although we do not have a website currently, and we hope to have it soon.
Thanks. We have written them.

Bitcoin seems such a wonderful community! We're completely pleased!
You guys have converted us to use the digital currency. We thought it is something very complex. 
While I still don't understand few things (how to transfer it to Ukraine, what do I need etc.) but we hope with your help we can figure it out. 
Our goal is just very big and if this Bitcoin community can play a big role in achieving or bringing us closer to that, we'll be indebted...digitally! :)
**We have unfortunately less time, and we request your help. Spread the word and please contribute in any way you can.**
**Edit:** Shout out to you guys, you are awesome! 
We were too scared to even try Bitcoin, and thought it is something too technical for us. But you guys have been very helpful.  Right now we are reading more and learning more about Bitcoin. 
We think we have figured out that it shouldn't be too hard to withdraw Bitcoins in Ukraine. This is so much better than normal currency and banks! 
As a small gesture of thanks, we're adding the Bitcoin address on our AMA. 
**Please contribute, and spread the word about this campaign among your friends and acquaintances, it is very important and critical for us.**
We are still far from the goal, and we really wish and hope that the Bitcoin community helps us bring closer to our goal.
**Edit 2:** We have hit $1500 mark, thanks to you! This is absolutely something new for us...
**Edit 3:**  We have crossed the $2000 mark!
**Bitcoin community is amazing. We want to be one of the first campaign of its kind in Eastern Europe to get funded by BTC. Maybe we can make it a reality? :)**

That's 2,7% of our aim that we seek though, although it's really effective that we are more than 22% of our indiegogo donations, just through bitcoins only.
Given the amount of trolls and other throwaway accounts and with several AMAs yesterday, our own AMA and campaign was undermined a bit. And more than that, we actually have a lot to cover through for campaign and long distance to go.


We asked mods here if they could sticky this post, but they politely declined, which is fair since they said that we are not a big international charity as such.
We are very impressed by power of Bitcoin - this is something entirely new for us. 
Who knows we might be one of the first social campaigns in Eastern Europe to be completely funded by a digital currency... that'd be great!
Do you think we should do it and post on such cryptocurrency forums? Which sites or forums would you suggest us for it?

Actually we cannot receive payments through PayPal in Ukraine.
Also, we have heard many cases of abuse through PayPal, so we prefer
either cash or wire transfer. Or, in fact, get funds transferred by ourselves - since we've been helped by so many people here!

Wow, you seem to have a lot of hate filled inside.
Just looked at your comment history, Redditor for 1 day and all comments are about AMA
Oh and one more:


We are here for sincere efforts. We are on this sub because we were suggested about this digital currency but some wonderful people here.
And not here to feed the trolls - kindly do that somewhere else. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 14:22:28
Thank you... 
We're going to do it
@_date: 2014-08-01 01:49:01
