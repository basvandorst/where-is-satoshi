Your constant brigading and negativity is why you can't engage someone in a meaningful discussion. Highlighting what you think are problems, and provoking meaningful debate have value, but most of what you post is 'I told you so', inaccurate facts and things that others may find offensive - aka trolling. Money is factually far from the most important thing in our universe, FYI (oxygen on planet earth, water, gravity, social relationships - I could go on).
It's also very odd to come to community that you clearly don't like and post compulsively. I don't like caviar, therefore I obviously don't to a caviar forum to tell everyone else how wrong and stupid it is to like it.

Yeah that's fairly normal. Mine has around that many connections and I rarely see any outbound blockchain upload traffic on it. It's still important for the network as a relay though AFAIK so I try to run it as much as possible.

I think that experience is common for the majority of individuals in this space, even the earliest adopters. Most have had a significant 'missed opportunity' in either BTC or Alts.

The author is only a fool if they sell for a loss (unless it's an emergency) with this particular asset. Accepting and addressing that they didn't receive instant gratification (and the reasons why they sought it), and then practicing patience and nerve would likely serve well in this situation. Above doesn't apply to the majority of Altcoins though.

Can I buy bitcoin with reddit gold and then buy pizza? �� If I can, it's a real Christmas present.

All in good time, the precipice takeover event will surely occur once this is achieved and we shall inherit the earth. Thanks for the Silver!

Too may people were waiting for precisely 3k (the biggest historical support line). Anticipating that, more experienced traders set their buys a bit higher - something we have seen more often the past couple of years. Always best to start buying gradually as the resistance line gets closer and pay attention to the order book depth and triple/double bottoms. The more time one has in the markets the better equipped to assess and trade on these dynamics. I would wait for a slight pullback before buying this recent pump, but 3k is looking less likely.

The word bitcoin miner (eh hem, digger) just got a new addition to the definition.

You sold low for a loss after buying high out of FOMO then panic. This is your way of processing it your loss. Problem is that its banal, boring and also embarrassing for yourself. Contributes nothing to the discussion.

You're an idiot, and that is a really stupid 'point'. Not engaging anymore. Good luck being alone forever.

For newbies I think Blockchain.info. just be careful about backups.
