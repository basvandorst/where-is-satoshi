I think that was just more satire
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:00:31
Satire, that actually mirrors some truth with these know it all teens, lol

This.  Now that everyone is trying to get a piece of the pie the game has changed.  It's now used by institutions and will eventually be used as currency that volatility has to slow down a bit.  Not everyone can get rich, and since everyone is now expecting that, the money will be moving somewhere else.

Unless you yourself forget the password to the encrypted .zip file.

Me too.  I can't stand these teenagers thinking they're so much smarter than their parents.  The memes are annoying too.

That’s ridiculous. If we’re taxed on gains and don’t convert to fiat until the next year, or even years after that and it drops, wouldn’t we lose the fiat money we paid the government in the year of the taxable event?  If they aren’t willing to treat crypto as a real currency than it shouldn’t be taxed like one. At least for crypto to crypto, that is.

Agreed, would just suck though if I somehow forgot that as well

Hence the invention of the "short squeeze"

I love the analysis you made here...tons of red flags so I'm gonna go with scam here as well.

How do I report gains/losses on crypto to crytpo transactions when I have no record of USD value at that time, only record I have is the price I sold for that currency pair (I.E. sold 9000 XRP for 1.2 BTC)?  With hundreds of day trades, (mostly losses) this seems quite tedious to figure in USD for each trade.  Any tips?
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:23:26
Just bitcoin, or crypto in general?
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:30:56
Basically what all the noob panic sellers are doing right now, lol

No one knows what will happen.  And what does happen, will be without ration or reason.

You can gamble away a 401K too if you choose to put it in a mutual fund that drops.

And now all the people that were all butt-hurt about missing out crawl out of the woodwork gloating.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:52:30
Not exactly.  I believe it (or crypto in general) will eventually be adopted.  But it will be as a functional currency, meaning the price will not fluctuate as much, and therefore be reliable to spend and store value, with no more get rich quick schemes.

It's going to 100K easily by the end of April.  I'm sure there's someone out there willing to saute and eat their left nut if it doesn't!
