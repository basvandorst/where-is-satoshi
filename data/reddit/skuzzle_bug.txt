If someone could find a way an algorithm could be blindly directed with a set of rules to find cures for diseases, that would gain support from the world. Mining and crypto could have actual faith behind it at that point.  Just a shower thought.

Ouch that's a lot of dough.  Congrats on your ventures. I need a napkin @_date: 2014-08-11 17:02:41
I imagine solo mining with that much power would be profitable.  Its practically a pool all on its own.

Have a quarter for supporting the cause @_date: 2013-12-25 08:25:19
You won't get a lot of local traffic in town that time of year, I can guarantee that.  You would need to get closer to the ships and be street level to be successful IMO.  It's a great idea.

This shop isn't in downtown Juneau. It's hidden in a mall in the valley.  Its nowhere near tourist traffic.  I love that they have the balls to show support in this politically...colorful town.

Those spaces aren't cheap. Plus you have to rent them all year. And heat them in the winter even when they are vacant.  Im not sure if it's that way for all of them. But the few I have asked that's how she goes.

That isn't bad at all.  How is the traffic in the senate? I've lived here for almost 30 years and I don't think I've been there twice.

I wonder if mining difficulties will change for better or worse if this falls flat on it's ass. I still love Bitcoin. Great idea, awesome hobby and perfect way to heat my garage.
