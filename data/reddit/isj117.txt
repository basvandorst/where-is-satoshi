Okay so that's the scandal with the "leaving empty blocks" thing.

Thanks for the clear description, you did correct a misconception about how this works. 
So let me know if I have this straight, the miners are actually the bottleneck in the fees limit and not the full node yes? By picking a limited number of transactions to verify and since the 1MB limit is in place they wont include lower rate transactions. Correct?

Okay so I'm already doing that, so I would open that up as a VM appliance template then push it out to the cluster. 
1. Would there be any value in multiple VMs on the same hypervisor?
2. Is Bitcoind single threaded or anything I should know?
3. Could I use the same blockchain data on say a NFS drive? I noticed it "locks" the data but is this a hard restriction?
At the current setup I have I could spin up literally hundreds of full nodes (might not fit on a 10g trunk link tho) but hard drive capacity wise it seems redundant and impractical to host 15+ TB of the same data... Thoughts? I could do de-dupe in ZFS but I think thats whole file or nothing not just parts of the large files.

Okay, looks like I'll need to read a bit, this will put a scratch in the general bitcoin fee's yea? And if you could, can you summerise why this is different from the usual methods? Thanks in advance.
Edit: Never-mind I found their chatroom.  I'll go bug them.
**Anyone else have other options too?**

Thanks, you've answered my questions. I dont think its worth throwing up so many of the full-nodes but ill throw up 3 with tons of resources, take care &amp; Merry Christmas.
