I'm not all in because people are talking but because I did my own research. Maybe you are holding BTC because people are talking? But nothing wrong with that. Everyone has like their own opinion, man.

ok? look up blockstream, lookup how lighning network works, look at satoshis white paper. Im not reinventing the wheel here.

I said I "held" bitcoin since 2013 obviously until I went all in on BCH. Not sure how to make it any clearer for you. And its BCH not Bcash...this concerns me that you dont know this.

I think deep down inside you are just afraid of all the changes happening to BTC in the cryptosphere. And how irrelevant potentially bitcoin could end up in the future. Nice, i held bitcoin since 2013 too. Do you still hold AOL stock too from when AOL was big?

That is nice that you contributed code. You seem to have a grasp of how blockchain technology works, cool. However, you seem to not fully understand the economics and the private interest groups who want a piece of the actions behind the distributed ledger systems. They know that scalability is a problem within bitcoin, and yes the community is trying to address the problem. But are you aware that scalability has been long solved? The code and algorithm has already been patented. Bitcoin will have to use it while once again private interest groups collect fees turning bitcoin into a giant centralized super bank that doesn't benefit the greater good of mankind while potentially even seeking to influence policy changes that puts other crypto coins and its users at risk of not having freedom of separating themselves from our banking system. With Bitcoin already mainstream the flood of new investors and people wanting to own bitcoin couldn't care less of how the back end code works for bitcoin they just wanna own bitcoin like a pair of nike sneakers just for the fact that its cool to own and to see the value rise to make a quick buck. And yet there is a dumb fight between bitcoin community and bitcoin cash that is not benefiting anyone. How do we fix this?

blockstream owns bitcoin, blockstream is backed by banks and private interest today, implementation of lightning network will turn bitcoin into another centralized financial institution that will force businesses to be transaction hubs who blockstream collects transaction fees from...this is not what satoshi wanted, satoshi wanted bitcoin to be permissionless peer to peer electronic cash that cannot be manipulated by private interests and laws, blockstream devs that didn't agree with this bitcoins new direction have been removed and some jumped ship to bitcoin cash who are trying to continue Satoshi Nakamotos vision..bitcoin is not bitcoin anymore, it has been infiltrated and manipulated, only we the people can fix this, we need to protest and pressure the bitcoin devs not to steer away from nakamotos vision that made bitcoin great

 lol
Yes, when it was showing signs of success with slower transaction times and ridiculously high  fees.  lol
I'm done responding to you after this, your logic doesn't make any sense. And you clearly can't distinguish BCH from Bcash and that shows me the level of your inelegance and ignorance.

its going ok, im in it long term...how is your bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:16:20
 this is my theory, i think all the bitcoin is fine, i think they're just using our hashing power to mine for themselves...in a few days they will say everything is ok...but while we we waited they mined a shit ton of coins for themselves with our hashing power
