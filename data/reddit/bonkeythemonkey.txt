I'm sure the exact same conversation happened when BTC was at $1, $20, $400, $1000

Hmm I'm expecting BTC to trade at $200,000 in 4 years time. That's only a 20x move from here.

You don't need $1 for the value of every asset in the universe because some people will never trade their bitcoin. If there was only 1 bitcoin traded then it could be $2billion.


You can by fractions of a $2billion coin like 0.0049

Hmm that was probably the last real chance anyone could've had to get 1 whole bitcoin.

Yea... but the market was going to hit 7.9k this regardless of the news. There was just so much money to be made on liquidating the shorts and causing a fomo.

You're suppose to sell as it does a run like this rather than buy in because it can turn very fast

that was over a year ago....

People don't use bitcoin for this type of shit
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:32:17
20x from the low is the standard so don't sell and buy back in higher...
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:24:26
too late... I've lost it all :(

You'll realize why you don't use bitcoin for this type of shit after the first time, once you work out the silly cost you paid and then see bitcoin do a 500% move thinking "oh shit why did I buy these shitty gift cards"
We've all done it once and then never again.
