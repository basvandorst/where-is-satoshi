It's already been the "next scam" trading in yobit for months. Then again, only someone completely fucking retarded would buy a copy paste novelty bullshit coin and expect something else.
@_date: 2016-08-12 07:26:14
It's clear that they didn't run their business according to the rules. As in past tense. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 16:21:39
I don't even want regulation. I just want the company that gets robbed to lose money, and not their customers. Or *gasp* routines that makes then unable to lose $70 million in an hour. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:49:01
Depends entirely on whether there are victims or not. You can't steal from someobe that says you didn't. If they make customers whole, and take the loss on their balance sheet they could easily let the hacker off the hook. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 16:46:22
None of the definitions automatically apply to Bitfinex. Depending on how you see the hack, Bitfinex were the victim of theft. 
@_date: 2016-08-22 06:01:40
Okidoki kid, you might want to get back to your altcoins now.

@_date: 2016-08-21 02:33:24
1. Baiting.
2. You don't understand how the Blockchain works. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:26:03
You took the risk of leaving USD on an exchange. There is zero difference between the two. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:12:39
Sure. But then again, he can easily just keep himself in hookers and blow doing OTC traded and mixing 500 BTC at a time. Not too many people that wouldn't buy BTC, tainted or not at a 30℅ discount either. No need for theatrics as we have seen from Bitstamp hack, Sheepmarket, Silkroad 2.0 etc. The only think he doesn't want to do is hold for years and let Blockchain analysis catch up and identify him. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:19:31
Well, it seems Bitfinex will make sure all their customers are equally fucked by simply opening without rolling back margin positions anyway. 
Pretty sure I'll go ahead and file suit for my most likely margin called long position that they disallowed from closing before market price dropped. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 02:30:37
Only brain-dead people make blanket statements about millions of people. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:20:03
100℅ likely to be a scam, and 100℅ illegal to take part in a deal for stolen funds. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:43:21
Also. 91 confirmations? That takes a while. No way the hack was at 18.00 UTC
@_date: 2016-08-12 16:48:23
All you type is 100℅ speculation with zero evidence. Good luck with thay in life. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 04:54:35
Agreed. But that's where crypto is an odd asset since it's limited in supply and in a lot of legal "room" with different countries treating them differently. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 02:36:18
Who cares. Trunocoin has already taken most of the money retards will give up on yobit (the shitcoin scam exchange of choice for idiots) and is dead.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:47:35
Sure. But the underpinning value of those coins was less than $50/BTC at MtGox. The rest was caused by willibot during the run-up to the crash. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 02:25:29
Clear cut theft and pump and dump scam isn't a moral judgement call. I wouldn't be surprised if the "founders" (see scammers) end up in jail before too long. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 02:29:12
And obly lose 10% if you try to move 20+ BTC due to shallow market. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 14:16:29
The entire point is thay you don't have to with KeepKey holding your funds as you approve evey outgoing transaction by signing it physically.

At a crypto exchange ran from a foreign country. So how is it different than being in crypto again?
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:07:17
I have no issues trading there in the future. Given that they provide a financial statement, security audit, solvency report, real time hot and cold wallet auditing and true account-segregated multi signature with me as primary key holder. So..... 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:12:36
In this scenario they legally have to socialize the losses. The law doesn't care about individual accounts if the company is insolvent. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 02:28:03
And then spam about it 5 times a day for pennies? Oh wait, that's just the developers doing that. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:18:57
Logical, but unlikely that they were THAT fast. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 02:32:04
Astonishing amount of denial in the comments. Yeah, Bitfinex is fine, they didn't do anything illegal or shady and will 100% have no problem in the future. 
Thats so last month. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 23:11:26
Oh no, a 20 year old kid may have made a mistake. Why aren't the CIA working this?
@_date: 2016-08-21 02:39:45
I seriously doubt that. 
@_date: 2016-08-23 14:11:31
Well yeah, but an anonymous one makes it far easier to realize the profits from the scam..
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:09:44
They won't be. Even socializing the loss to ButGo using all their capital, and raising more I doubt they can swallow $60 million+
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:20:02
Id this is true it's more than likely coverable by finex.
@_date: 2016-08-21 08:17:52
Aww... Did you piss yourself or just grow up in a trailer full of inbreds?
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:19:47
None of it is illegal til they are charged and sentenced in court. Rule violation with fines and "they are an illegal company" isn't the same thing. And even it it was, there is currently no legal complaint lodged openly again the company. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 02:17:32
He's implying two things. 1. If the addresses are in LE possession (they are) they might be waiting the hackers. 2. They might be sending small transactions to facilitate mapping of the receiving aggresses and possible action it coins are moved to exchange. 
Also. Selling the coin doesn't mean selling the private key. They still control that, and can use it to send taint coins.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:18:10
How is it different? If they are insolvent ALL assets are equally liable. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:08:12
Worth less at the time of loss. And it was 400k all said and done. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 02:24:20
What's worse, having it in the hand of known scammers that are dumping it on the market. Ftfy
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:40:34
Doesn't matter to customers though since you are equally responsible for all types of assets. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 16:30:35
Counter argument? You apparently think transactions don't affect the transaction trail. Not much today about that. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:21:51
Seems a company is legal until it's illegal. So per definition, Bitfinex is legal. 
@_date: 2016-08-18 17:21:07
Bought my keepkey months ago, and not only is the hardware just great. Support is above and beyond. A++ experience. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:45:18
Not by the end of the day. 
@_date: 2016-08-18 17:26:58
Blew me away. I had an issue with an early keepkey thay didn't load full transaction history and I was worried a transaction was "lost" (8+ BTC).
The keepkey team worked on it over I think the weekend before Thanksgiving. Providing updates every few hours. 
Solved it for me before the weekend was over. Truly a great experience. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:42:04
At least "more likely" to be either a scripted rotation script to secure funds. Could of course be the hackers as well, but we shall see.

Theory and practice are not the same thing. If they were there would be zero miners outside of China. 
@_date: 2016-08-22 06:03:21
Or we can just let them hang themselves when the dark market exit scams them for all their coin. Aka. gets hacked. 
@_date: 2016-08-27 04:08:56
Yuck. Now I feel like if I buy it I'll be a racist orange idiot. Thanks.
@_date: 2016-08-16 18:36:23
That's not the option.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:17:43
What would that prove? There are $10s of millions in shorts on the exchanges every single day. A large short is not even close to evidence of wrongdoing. He could short as much as he wanted completely safely. 
The DAO hacker shorted a TON of ETH and he hasn't been even close to being found. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:16:12
Hey, at least my 240 BTC leveraged long is still open so. . . Oh wait. . 
@_date: 2016-08-27 13:17:09
Overall it has never been true, but it is slowly getting closer. I live on the US and pay $0.08/kWh and have mined with positive ROI on every generation of mining equipment so far.
I will give you that it's not massive amounts, and in reality during some periods buying BTC and holding was a better investment than mining. 
I do think that we are nearing a point where home mining will be financially viable again. And I think that is due to technological advances that were almost impossible to predict (efficiency of ASIC).
Ironically it's actually easier for home miners to ROI than large farms due to the inverse economies of scale when it comes to management and cooling. 
Thay said, no one is getting really wealthy from home mining any longer. So it's more of a hobby. 
I'm not really arguing that the theory is not true, it's just that theory takes a very long time to catch up to practical application. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 02:26:16
Only spammers use it as it is. Founder won't get diluted, he will just dumb, make millions a go away.

In a chapter 11 scenario all coins are treated equally badly. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:19:07
Not THAT insured I'm sure. I negotiated with them a few years ago and the insurance cost rises with the sum you want to insure as a customer. $60 million would be $100k+ a month if I remember correctly. Not sure Bitfinex has that level of insurance. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:15:49
Obviously they don't need a lesson to figure out the attack vectors. What they do need is funds back, and the hacker might like to not be chased by the FBI and crypto community. Keeping $20 million and walking away might be fairly attractive. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:50:09
If short volume increases five fold hours before a 50℅ crash induced by a hack, conclusions can be drawn. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 15:53:12
"Grumpy holdouts" is an interesting way of describing people that got robbed. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:06:06
Except for the inevitable customer DDOS of course. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:59:01
If course that's not fair. But that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:14:30
It's real easy being cavalier with money when you are winning. I had the same attitude before my 200 BTC vanished into the hackers hands. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:18:49
It's their money. They could easily structure a legal deal that lets him off at least close to completely. Or at the very least enough that people stop looking. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 02:40:43
Did you really expect some fly by night gambling site would pay out 100 BTC? Well, that's almost cute. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:33:11
"doesn't seem likely"? Yeah, no way that he was behind the extra 5000 BTC margin short volume hours before the DAO hack. Prob just a coincidence. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:41:42
Where can you see this and what sums? 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:45:58
Well, that's game over then. Will you still reopen to allow users to withdraw any remaining client funds.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:14:13
Not sure that it will matter for me personally. I had pretty solid margin in my position but depending on when they come back, that might not matter.
@_date: 2016-08-18 17:22:50
The fact that they were hacked could you know, be part of the reason that they are presenting this offline key solution. 
Also. They weren't hacked in a traditional sense. They had an employee betray their trust. Quite different than code incompetence. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:12:40
It's irrelevant what Bitcoin was when MtGox went down since the bitcoin price at that point had almost no Fiat backing. Price was massively inflated by the insider trades that eventually killed gox. 
Bitfinex is a completely different situation. 
The "real value" of the bitcoin lost today is greater. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:40:20
More like 0.01 BTC to 1000 people, 200 times over weeks and weeks. Adding new people and inputs every hour. That's a lot of data to slog through. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:14:02
Well, there sure as hell was never $80 million in actual funds in MtGox that were lost. It was 90℅ "air" 
@_date: 2016-08-27 04:09:50
Almost anything will ROI over time with no running costs what so ever, so yeah. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:13:13
Yeah, well most likely. But it didn't become devastating before it started playing the marker over the total collateral. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 00:23:19
Does it come with a while gaggle of spamming retards to post about it 5 times a day on Reddit?
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:20:37
Yeah, ha ha. No way that they would cooperate with the law or anything.

Just because someone else is making more money, doesn't mean making money is bad. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 02:20:50
90% of the people that lost money did so because they wouldn't withdraw for a very long time. Also: for over a year, they were the only exchange available. If you got USD in and managed to buy BTC in 2011-2012 you are up 10-500x even with the massive loss in the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 21:26:53

@_date: 2016-08-02 23:09:03
About 1.5 Gox if you factor in spot price at 400k-ish Goxcoins lost. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:18:09
Not in "real money" since Willi Bot that was responsible for the volume from $100-$1000 also was the reason for the loss. At $100 losses in real equity terms are larger with Bitfinex. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:24:30
Per customer. Bitfinex is a customer, you are not. This might mitigate 1/200th of the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-27 12:52:52
Your.... Yep, Trump standard retard confirmed
@_date: 2016-08-25 21:28:05
Bitcoin is (in the show, as in life) the real currency. E-coin is the debt coin north from the hack and banks inability to operate a functional chain of equity custody. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:21:29
Agreed. But what I am talking about isn't paper value, but rather invested equity. 
The run-up that led to the $1k peak and following massive crash was underpinned by almost no actual investments as it was basically just a bot driven internal rally.
I'd imagine based on Gox Fiat balances (post crash) that the "equity value" of the 400.000 BTC (invested Fiat total) was less than $25 per BTC. 
In the case of Bitfinex I'd wager it's closer to $300 average. 
It's a somewhat squirrel way of looking at it, but I think it measures "real impact" better.
And in that light I think the Bitfinex theft was actually worse for the customers. 
Sure, it sucks to lose "$10 million in BTC value" , but if you only paid $50k for them, it's play money anyway. 
A lot of the people that lost "huge sums" in Gox, were early adopters that may have lost 10k BTC, but to them it only represented $500 in invested equity, or some mining time. 
If you pay $10 million and lose $10 million, you are in for a real rough experience. 
I hope that makes my view a little clearer. 
Tldr: It sucks to lose a winning powerball ticket, but if you work for 50 years to make $200 million and lose that, then life sucks more. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:26:37

@_date: 2016-06-24 20:11:48
Depends entirely on if it's bitfury that is selling or not. The founding group at bitfury has 100.000s of BTC in personal holdings. But yeah, if it's the corporate entity. Definitely a paper trail 9 miles long. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 23:44:50
So it's important to finish THAT hardfork, but not do anything about keeping up with the vision of Satoshi and fork to increase blocksize. Gotcha, good thing we have you to interpret what is essential and what is not.

@_date: 2016-06-24 11:25:33
In this phase I agree. Previous 6 years this was not true, but we are reaching critical trading mass and small market cap (still) causes more volatility than it should. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 13:29:17

@_date: 2016-09-29 18:55:58
Well, not do be a dick but having a relatively new Reddit account doesn't mean I haven't been active in the Bitcoin community since 2012. 
There is also plenty more research done on blocksize increase than segwit/lightning and a fork for larger blocks would be trivial conspired to the multi tier implementation of segwit and payment channels. 
Comparing it to ETH is pointless since no one is against the concept of a hard fork, just the reasons behind it. 
Bitcoin has already forked several times with no issues. 
So yes.

Yeah, keep transactions to a minimum. That's how you grow. 
@_date: 2016-09-29 17:14:23
Where do you get this notion? Most of the western world have internet connections over 50 Mbit and a 2 TB drive is like $40.
You can run a node on an VPS that can handle 20 MB blocks for like $20/month.
If the "community" can't handle that to scale transaction capability 10 x then Bitcoin deserves to fail.

Blocks will still be full, and no one will still have figured out how to implement lightning.

Personally I think measuring "average" over time is irrelevant since it doesn't take into consideration the fact that usage of the Blockchain has slowed due to the fee peaks and congestion but ok. 
And no, I realize that in chain scaling comes at a price. But claiming that it will "just not work" because we need to take into consideration people running nodes on a modem with a T81 calculator like Lukejr wants is just not smart.

This is what's wrong with the bitcoin ecosystem. Miners should be at the very top. 
@_date: 2016-09-28 16:13:18
Everything is vaporware until implemented. Also. Most of core critics have no problem with segwit or lightning. We (I) just feel that it has been a huge time sink to delay on chain scaling waiting for segwit and lightning that isn't out yet and doesn't even have a time set roadmap.

Any financial instrument that includes a mechanism of which a owner is restricted from selling the product over an open market is a scam, period. (with the exception of contractual lock in periods of preferential shares or strike dates for options and futures) Onecoin is a clear Ponzi based on this alone. The fact that it's not an actual crypto currency isn't even important in the light of the fact that market price and exit quantity is set by the same central organization that profits from the sale of the instrument. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 14:04:57
Yes it would. Geographical decentralization no, but ownership decentralization is more important from a "bad actors" standpoint.

You are both wrong. It's about 12% if we strip variance. Look ar pool % not blocks found over a short timeframe. 
@_date: 2016-10-12 23:32:52
As much as I would have agreed with you in 2012, in today's crypto landscape this would most likely lead to a devaluing spiral with users jumping ship for other currencies and bitcoin dying a death of many small cuts. 
I also don't see miners being able to, or having motivation to perform any action so detrimental to the network that truly drastic action is motivated. 
That said. In a situation you describe, I would probably argue that Bitcoin would essentially reset, with price dropping to double or even single digits on extinction fear alone.

Miners know this. And they are justifiably worried that mining fees aren't going to cover mining cost at next halving or the one after using 1MB block size. Why would they want to compete with lightning on uneven terms?
@_date: 2016-10-22 04:12:01
By whom? Not the community I'm sure. Or the many other developers. Or the person that stated that it was on the roadmap. Or are you talking specifically through extension blocks, or just larger blocks as a whole?

You can call it what you want. The intent of Bitcoin was always to have the entities that propagate transactions decide on the structure of the network. The miners are the network, you are not.

So I guess we can just turn off the miners And blocks will flow freely? Oh wait. You would think even node owbers would realize that running a node for $40 is slightly less "I'm the backbone of the network" than $100 million in mining hardware. Sure we need nodes. But I'm pretty sure that Bitmain could setup 10k nodes over a weekend if they wanted to.
