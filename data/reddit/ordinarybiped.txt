Everyone predicts the next economic crash.
@_date: 2019-11-04 07:59:49
That's irresponsible. You should never put all your eggs in the same basket. You should try to diversify from now on. I know my comment won't be popular here obviously, but seriously if you believe that it's a certainty that Bitcoin will go to the moon in the next few years you're delusional. There's absolutely NO certainty in that, anything can happen.
@_date: 2019-11-16 08:47:58
For a moment I thought this was about macroeconomics and then I read the comments and remembered where I was. Sorry, buy Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:39:44
How dare you saying that here
@_date: 2019-11-15 08:53:49
100% true and effective
@_date: 2019-08-25 13:41:48
That's not issue, the issue is mass adoption and Bitcoin being used in everyday life
@_date: 2019-10-24 23:26:08
Why are you saying "Mark"? Is he some kind of acquaintance of yours or something?
@_date: 2019-08-25 23:24:20
What happened to you so that you could be so butthurt from such a simple comment?
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:26:08
Are you freaking kidding me. There is no way she has enough understanding of any of this. She's obviously used by adults. Stop being so naive. If something goes the way you think doesn't mean it's right, she's just a kid, she can't lecture anyone about economics.
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:28:21
Anyone here thinking otherwise should take a good look at themselves and realise how pathetic they are.
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:27:18
Yeah it does. It's completely unethical.
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:27:38
Thanks. A rare glimpse of common sense here.
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:27:01
And it's disgusting to see so many adults here being happy about this. They should be seriously ashamed of themselves.
@_date: 2019-10-26 18:48:08
OP if you're older than 12 I've got bad news about your IQ for ya
@_date: 2019-12-28 22:27:26
No. BTC will be mainstream and accepted worldwide when it will be easy, cheap and secure to use for every day operations. This is not the case actually. And the denial from the community is pushing the date of mainstream adoption even further.
@_date: 2019-12-26 20:52:50
That's not what happened. You're presenting things so we think you're innocent and youtube is evil. It's not. You're evil. That's why youtube removed your content.
@_date: 2019-12-26 21:40:27
That sub is full of people willing to believe conspiracy theories so it's not surprising scammers are using it to complain when youtube ban their shit content
@_date: 2019-12-24 12:17:01
You're dreaming.
@_date: 2019-12-26 18:00:53
How is demonetization the same as censorship? Please explain this to me.
@_date: 2019-12-12 23:43:13
10 millions... How many people have a credit card, or fiat? 7 billions. That's 0.1% of the population. And those 10 millions definitely don't use Bitcoin every day.
@_date: 2019-12-15 15:44:17
How is that related to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-12-03 07:33:13
Go tell that to most people who are still afraid of online banking
@_date: 2019-12-05 08:17:50
Here we see the reason why Bitcoin is not going to be mainstream any time soon.
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:10:23
Any example?
@_date: 2019-12-26 21:09:45
That's so retarded, like most posts in this sub.
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:00:13
Theres no censorship on YouTube.
@_date: 2019-12-18 21:08:00
@_date: 2019-12-02 22:30:11
Because it had 1 chance in a billion to succeed at that time
@_date: 2019-12-15 10:36:46
1 million $ is nothing. Your local dentist has a bigger insurance fund.
@_date: 2019-12-27 01:46:20
No... Only scams got removed, people tried to associate themselves with bitcoin but bitcoin was never the reason why youtube kicked them out
@_date: 2019-12-24 10:33:20
By that time the central banks will have made their own cryptos and Bitcoin will be nothing more than an historical curiosity.
@_date: 2019-12-26 20:32:37
"Merry christmas" are you sure you understood what that means? Obama is saying that you can't be free in a world where people can hide illegal activity. And he's totally right. There's no freedom from tyranny if tyranny can be protected by encryption.
@_date: 2019-12-02 22:27:24
Right, because the average Joe is a computer security expert.
@_date: 2019-12-15 18:17:51
Right, OK
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:47:59
You failed
@_date: 2019-12-02 23:03:16
You're completely delusional. You're assuming most people have confidence with anything done on a computer. Nothing could be further from the truth.
@_date: 2019-12-12 23:13:19
That's not the reason. The reason is that it's way less practical and user friendly than fiat. The state of denial in that community is way too high.
@_date: 2019-12-13 15:26:48
Hackers could have exploited potential flaws though, as bitcoin is still very much a work in progress
@_date: 2019-12-14 19:29:50
If you had any notion of macroeconomics you would know nothing could be further from the truth. The economic situation was much better when they were young.
@_date: 2019-12-26 21:43:34
This title explains in one sentence why bitcoin won't go mainstream for at least decades, if ever at all
@_date: 2019-12-02 22:54:58
Yeah they did more than anyone else to make bitcoin more mainstream, a ton more than this sub ever had or ever will
@_date: 2019-12-15 10:35:19
If you're not into tech and programming (and I mean if you don't know how to use Bitcoin outside of exchanges) and want to invest some of your savings in bitcoins, just go to coinbase and buy some there. I know some people will jump on me for saying that, but those people ARE techies, and you're not. Coinbase is the safest way to do it as they're the biggest player. It's highly unlikely they will fall as they already manage billions of $. Smaller companies might offer you more, but you also take the risk of them collapsing and you would lose everything. And that has happened many times in the past.

ITT: people who don't understand why private companies can't be allowed to issue their own currencies.
