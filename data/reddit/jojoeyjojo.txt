Check any market site like Bitcoinity and they'll show you the numbers of Bitcoins needed to shift the price up and down to whatever level you want.
The markets have very thin order books, so neither number is particularly big. There may be 11 million of the things out there, but there's a very small fraction being actively traded.

Regulations aren't to blame for every Bitcoin exchange being a bunch of shitty computer guys playing at captains of industry with no knowledge of financial security or economics and $600 million of other peoples money on the line.
The fact that competitors got called out as shit and not supported by the financial sector is not a bad thing, think how many more Mt Goxes there would have been!

That's what most people in r/bitcoin are secretly here for, they want another speculation bubble to get rich quick.

I really like Not because of any intelligent or quality posts here, but because I get to see economically ignorant people condescendingly dismissing something that is taking over the world economy as we speak.
As Bitcoin continues to grow like I know with absolute certainty that it will, I look forward to coming to this sub and watching you people try to resists as Bitcoin takes over.
You will stubbornly oppose bitcoin and refuse to convert your declining networth into the new superior money while being fucked into poverty by economic reality. You will be raped by bitcoin.
But it won't stop there. After bitcoin has established its supreme and unquestionable dominance over all money and economic activity and you scoffers are in abject poverty you will tearfully submit to Bitcoin like the bitches you are. You will offer whatever you have of value, your homes, your labor, etc for a few satoshis. You will do this because you will have to do it, as no one will accept your worthless fiat garbage.
And I'm going to be laughing as I watch you grovel and beg in the abyss of poverty while occasionally reminding you "I told you so"

I think you'd be hard pressed not to lay a lot of the $1100 crash at the hands of Mt Gox and the wave of negative press attention that followed.

Regulation of financial services so that site owners have culpability and oversight and can't just go "oh our friend has the wallet key that we need and we can't reach him, ciao", like has happened to several small exchanges in the last week?

Bitcoin has lost 50% of its value over the last 6 months, that's worse than basically every fiat currency caught in a financial crisis, like Greece or Iceland. Except Bitcoin isn't in a crisis, this is it *operating normally*

Anyone can start a business as long as they fulfill the regulations ensuring a minimum level of competence and oversight? Shouldn't be too hard.

I think it's mostly automated bots that are still reading the final Bitstamp total of 276 and probably making bad trades for their owners.
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:03:59
So everyone should sell now because it's only going lower and buy back in end of 2015/start of 2016

Yep, this, he didn't "just want to mine Bitcoins", he wanted to get rich quick, and was willing to go along with any unbelievable con that promised that.

The Ross guy hired the one guy not in prison from the group who built the original Silk Road. That guy wasn't in prison because he was an FBI agent.

Lets hope it was stored in fiat at a bank so it wouldn't be hacked and unrecoverable, eh?
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:21:56
It needs to recruit new members for the price to rise and absorb the millions of dollars in newly mined coins every week, which is similar.

How fucking dumb are they to hire the only guy not charged from the previous version. Surely that set off alarm bells?

You still have to deal with moving the ASICs and facilities wherever, you know - real world stuff.

I think it's worth noting because together all of those are pretty terrible for the Bitcoin business ecosystem. 
I mean, if creating a business about sneaking around Netflix regional restrictions that can be shut down at any time is a better, more profitable option than running "the NASDAQ of the future" then what does that say about Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:02:16
Yes, we certainly dismantled the Mt.Gox scam before anything bad happened like the unexplained disappearance of $620 million in BTC that no one was ever able to get back. 
It's a good thing that companies like Bitstamps internals operate completely off Blockchain, meaning that we can see in - oh wait.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:24:09
There's been lots of negative news:
* Bitstamp hack
* Butterfly Labs scam
* Vault of Satoshi shutdown
* CEX.IO shutdown, insolvency of every cloud mining company
* BitPay layoffs
The low price is hurting the Bitcoin business economy - the Bitpay one is the most worrying, if they fold then we lose so many companies like Microsoft too.
