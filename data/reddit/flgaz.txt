Everyone considering quitting cigarettes please investigate Vaping. Cigarettes are the best nicotine delivery system bar none. Patches did nothing for me, was able to quit using gum a couple of times and weened myself down on the Nicotine but 6 months later a overwhelming craving would come out of nowhere and I'd be back.
Vaping is about as old as Bitcoin, and just as experimental. With the network effect only now is real scientific study is going on with long term effects of vaping. Just like Cryptocurrency it is different than how we used to do it. So using IamHawke232 logic we shouldn't use a sauna/steamrooms because we don't usually breath warm steamy air. I am going to use both technologies and I have the belief they will both have profound disruptive effects on the future.

Did the same, then a month later Mike Hern rage quit Core and Bitcoin crashed! Oh well Bitcoin was now cheaper and I could buy more, Thanks Mike!

Don't agree. Is it possible that some small percentage of miners may risk that short term the price may go way down but in 5 years it may be much much higher and it is worth the risk to them? You are saying no one is willing to be that bold and or reckless?

That's a feature, not a bug!

Like having more control with bi-weekly purchase. 
Is automatic, but can tweek it at will.

As the Mining reward dwindles, the only incentive will be the transaction fee and if the network is big enough it will motivate enough miners to keep validating the transactions. Just one of the  many brilliant things Satochi set up. at the beginning Bitcoin was worthless. With no way to buy enough computers to run the network. You had to somehow get people to start the network. Over time if the network is successful the network will sustain itself.

Another good reason for Purse. Buy stuff on Amazon and get a discount and someone receives bitcoin expanding the network of users. Concentrating Bitcoin to just a handful of players does not make make the network more valuable.

Thanks for this. I never took a class on spreadsheets and this helped with how to automate getting the price, Kind of exactly what I was looking for, again Thanks
question what is the f(x) to get the price called? for Eth,Dash..ect

Maybe something to do with "Mixed Berries"?
@_date: 2016-11-02 04:58:15
Who said you had to buy a whole one? I could by 0.03 for under $23 USD right now.

You will need to see the question beneath the question you asked. 
Which is, What is the coinbase transaction? Is one thing happening or is there two completely different things happening within this function.
It is 2. You ask about the transaction fees being enough to sustain the system. As the system is set up as long as it is running any participant can choose to spend resources to mine for the network and help secure it. Fine so far.
The other function is the "Miner Reward". You are designing a peer to peer decentralized network and you have 21 million tokens you need to distribute as widely as possible (because you are designing a decentralized network). How would you do that? Helping secure the network has value, how about giving  the possibility of 50 tokens for 10 minutes of computer work? When I first leaned about it I remember  deciding that it is  kind of like a store gift-card. Never really saw usefulness in those. Pretty much dismissed that it could be immutable. Should I have set up an obsolete desktop as a miner? Well that ship has long since sailed. 
What happens when you subsidize something, you will have more of what you are subsidizing. There is a mind-boggling amount of hashing going on now. In my opinion because of the subsidy of the miner reward making the efficiency  of industrial scale operations more profitable. As the miner reward decreases it will make it harder for the large mining farms to justify spending capital to chase more hash power and the hashing target may go down.
I presently do not mine. Does not make sense for me to spend 2 BTC to mine and expect to make 0.5 BTC in five years. But I use electricity to heat my home in the winter and if I could spend 2 BTC  and heat my house  and end up earning 2.1 BTC in 5 years  I might consider taking the risk. (Just pulling the numbers out of thin air, I have not calculated it at all). It all depends on how decentralized the system is. We will have to see what the Market will decide.

Saw them on bitcointalk today the artist wants over $20 each for limited run of 100.

Haven't needed to try using this but it might help you out. [viabtc tx accelerator](

Found that clunky too, transactions are included in a block.

Wondering if anyone has written anything  about the possible parallel between Bitcoin and the first big conflict in early American history, the Whiskey Rebellion. Farmers were converting their grain into whisky because it was easier to transport, easier to store, and mice wouldn't eat it. Whiskey was a store of value. The Government was really in debt because of the war so they were trying to tax it, the farmers did not agree. People died over this and to quell it President Washington Pardoned some of the farmers.

No it wasn't!! I started buying 8 weeks before that. OK looking at the all-time chart it does look like a little bitty pimple.

Being programmable money a second layer of programming can do sub-satoshi (Lightning) and pool them to whole satochi to be included in the blockchain on settlement.

That is a really smooth curve! I'm expecting a wild bumpy ride.

Why are you not printing out paper wallets and putting small amounts of mBTC on them and using them person to person as bearer bonds. Just one transaction fee to get it on the blockchain, then the same paper wallet can be passed many times. If the situation is a matter of survival and the only merchant you can get food from will accept it, you will be able to exchange an empty wallet just once but you will still need to eat again.

Exactly this. the reason they are at 18% is I assume they are selling from a wallet they have held for at least a year so the capital gains IRS tax is 15%. Is a 3% profit margin after spending on getting the BTM's deployed so out of line? When I sell  on Coinbase Pro it is not a taxable event for the buyer but I will document my capital gains on my 1040.

Bitcoin is very fast, but you bought them with fiat money and they are really slow. The pending means that the money is slowly going through the banking system.

PBS (I think) showed a documentary a couple of weeks ago exploring miners around central Washington State. Very cheap Hydro power. The Electric Company was driving through a residential area with a camera crew. Came across a large Garden shed structure that they said use as much as 600 houses in this one smallish structure. Went to the nearby power transformer for the block. it was unusually hot. Up to now it has been unregulated that is going to change because of the cost of the upgrade to industrial scale infrastructure no one is willing to pay for and doesn't provide all that many jobs.

That monstrosity was already completed and in someones filing cabinet waiting  for the "right" time to be be enacted, It absolutely did not matter what party was in power at the time.

I remember going to a Home improvement show in the early 90's and one of the booths was selling Encyclopedias. Chatted with the salesman for a few minutes. I wasn't snarky, he was a person who needed a job and got one selling encyclopedias and still felt that they were useful. He was doing honest work and still the world changed.
