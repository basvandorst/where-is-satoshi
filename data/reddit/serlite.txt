I noticed that happening for a while too, and here's what I got when I contacted Support about this:








So...situation's not looking too promising, seeing as I sent the question in June. If more people were sending in Support requests about Bitcoin they might prioritize it higher, but I reckon that's a significant minority of HB buyers.

Worth noting that a lot of the highly-voted comments on responding to this news aren't fully supportive of this either. There are plenty of rational people involved in the crypto space, be careful not to ignore them for the more emotionally-driven ones.

Not trying to throw into doubt your understanding of Bitcoin, but an increase in mining hashpower will actually decrease the amount of time it takes to find a block, at least until the next difficulty adjustment (in about 1.5 days as of this writing).

I don't think we're disagreeing here - I concur that block time has consistently been under 10 minutes/block on average (otherwise, difficulty wouldn't have trended upwards to compensate). Hence, my original statement that an increase in mining hashpower will decrease block time.

I feel like you're overlooking the actual effect the increased hashpower has been having recently; on average, we've been having in excess of 7 blocks/hour these past several days (which is, well, a bit more than 2 seconds off the normal rate of 10 minutes/block).

This is rather frustrating news, as Steam was one of the few remaining vendors that accepted Bitcoin in my country.
At this point, BTC's meteoric rise in price is becoming a bit less exciting to me, because as time goes on I'm finding fewer places I can actually use it. I hope the tide turns in the future, but at the present I'm just a little disappointed that we seem to be regressing in adoption.

I'm not really invested in any side of the argument, but I was somewhat displeased by how blatantly certain Steam accounts appeared to be shills in that thread.
There were good points raised, but there was also a pile of level 0 users accounts, or older accounts that hadn't played a game for the past couple years. It makes it really hard to gauge how much actual user support there is for any of the cryptocurrencies being pushed by them as a result...

Although this move makes sense, it is a bit disheartening to me because most of the purchases I made with Bitcoin (prior to TX fees exploding) were less than $100.
At least their eventual support for other cryptocurrencies could make this possible again for me - I suppose in the meantime I'll just sit tight and watch the situation unfold.

It doesn't hurt to. Though if your plan is just to buy Bitcoin Cash and sit on it for the long term (and not try to play the markets), it's probably safer to create a wallet on your own machine (eg. Electron Cash) and move any purchased coins there.

Most big exchanges seem to support BTC/BCH trading - consider Bittrex or Poloniex, or even just ShapeShift.io if you're not intent on depositing your BTC to an exchange just to make a single trade. Note that asking about BCH on this sub may get you some negative reactions. For more supportive responses, consider r/btc (who are much bigger fans of it).

You may also find it under the ticker BCC (which can be bothersome since that was originally held by BitConnect Coin):

I love that Steam supports Bitcoin payments - it's the only currency I've been using there since they enabled it.
But since fees can at times be prohibitive (a lot of games are cheaper than the average TX fee when on sale!), I like to add funds to my Steam wallet in one big transaction when I plan to go on a spending spree.

In the spirit of completeness, I don't think it's accurate to say that wallets supporting the payment protocol consist of "mostly bitpay and copay". The list also includes wallets like Electrum and Bitcoin Core, so your options aren't that limited.
(That said, I'm not a huge fan of being restricted to using the payment protocol.)

Possibly worth noting that for a period prior to this, Newegg.ca already accepted Bitcoin as a payment option. Then BitPay lost their banking partner in Canada, causing Newegg to remove the option around May 2017.
I guess the situation has changed? News of adoption is always a plus, in any case.

Unfortunately not, Amazon and Newegg both deal in regionally-locked gift cards.
