More often than non-economists.

This is what every bitcoiner is hoping too.

I can see somebody still believes in the "free, anonymous, instant" slogan they've already removed from bitcoin.org (because it never was true)

In 1995 email was ubiquitous in universities. Cryptocurrency isn't.

Swiss banks have offered this service for decades if not centuries.

You don't actually understand what any of those words mean, do you?
@_date: 2019-03-26 10:27:31
Of course they do but that's beside the point.

If your "friend" is too dumb to use a normal bank transfer properly, how long do you think it'll take before he sends all his bitcoins into a black hole address?

Yes, religions do exist.

Real bitcoin died years ago when the devs introduced the first non backwards compatible bugfix :(
@_date: 2019-03-29 00:46:44


It's because the people writing them are retards.
@_date: 2019-03-07 10:14:50
And never use them at all. Just hodl.

Let's pretend the super-high fees, full blocks and various spam attacks never happened.
@_date: 2019-02-17 20:26:58
APompliano constantly lies when he's shilling bitcoins. He's a liar, a teller of deliberate falsehoods to deceive people.
@_date: 2019-02-18 10:47:09
So you're saying bitcoin will be fine in 25 years?
@_date: 2019-02-17 20:22:47
They have, it's called cash or another bank.
@_date: 2019-02-10 05:35:29
Actually it never was
@_date: 2019-02-13 03:29:45
More lies from PompAndDomp, eh?
@_date: 2019-04-11 12:47:03
Maybe turnp will pardon him too
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:44:02
Lol do you really think the wealthy people bailing out would be allowed to keep their wealth? When they leave just confiscate their real estate and stocks.
@_date: 2019-04-05 10:04:16
Enforced hodling, super good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-22 14:31:46
Lmao, every billionaire trying this would first pay lots of taxes in the conversion process and then utterly crash bitcoin when they try to cash out in Somalia, unless all their bitcoins are stolen first. I bet it becomes a super popular strategy!
The best part of course is that all the actual wealth (real estate, infrastructure, factories, technological know-how etc) remains in the country  and only worthless bitcoins leave it :D

The government officials are clearly smarter than you so at least you would be better off if they managed your money for you.
@_date: 2019-04-02 09:51:29
Yeah, it's mostly about mentally ill 4channers.
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:45:49
They do you dummy, the post you're responding to is complete nonsense.
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:51:15
Tell us more about your funny religious beliefs.
@_date: 2019-05-09 08:48:18


It's been ten years. You are not an early adopter in any sense, stop deceiving yourself.
@_date: 2019-05-09 08:52:11
Now this may be a confusing concept but sometimes people resort in hyperbole and purposefully misuse technical terms as a rhetorical device. If you mentally translate "Ponzi scheme" to "pyramid scheme" it suddenly starts to make sense.
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:39:10
Like, the total number of bitcoin UTXOs is about 50 million right now. There are over 7 billion people in the world. That's one UTXO for every 14 people supposedly using cryptocurrencies. Do they share it?
@_date: 2019-05-01 17:10:33
An even more interesting thing to consider: what if the moon is made of green cheese?
@_date: 2019-05-10 07:37:47
If you believe that 10% of the world's population is using cryptocurrency right now you're beyond deluded.
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:28:31


You did not link to Kaspersky Labs, you linked to a bitcoin propaganda site. Funny that you can't tell the difference.


Lmao, another one.
@_date: 2019-05-10 07:39:11
Factually bitcoin is a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:21:52
