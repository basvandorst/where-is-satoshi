You seem to have a deep misunderstanding on how the futures market works. There’s some good posts recently I would recommend reading up on first. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:39:16
My understanding is that it’s the power of the federal government to raise taxes. If the government needs more money to pay back its debt it can just it from increasing taxes. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:42:10
Nice! Make sure you understand whether you would owe taxes or not on it based on your local laws. At least in the US selling for a different coin is a taxable event. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:24:35
Completely agree and well said!
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:05:04
There’s unfortunately no way to not pay the transaction fee. The fee changes depending on how many people are trying to send bitcoin. So I would just wait for a different day when things are calmer and less people are trying to also send transactions (less competition for the same block). Maybe in a few days or so. Then the fee should only be about $1.50 then. It’s be high fees the past few days. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:34:34
Lol calm down. The answer then is that the futures are not affecting by hard forks beyond any price changes of the current bitcoin chain. I hope that answers your question.

This is amazing! Well done. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:11:51
Yes Coinbase is good. Use their exchange (GDAX) to sell with no fee and save 1.5%. It’s easy and the same login as Coinbase. You’ll need to get verified by giving your social security number, address, etc. Then just link your bank account to send the dollars to. 
Make sure you pay the capital gains taxes. Coinbase and the other exchanges may/will report your earnings to the IRS. This has come up in recent news. 
Congrats! Good luck and it’s pretty easy. Do a small amount initially until you figure it out.

Each share is supposed to represent 0.1 bitcoin and the shares are now 1K each. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:21:58
First do $500/$10,000 to see the amount of bitcoin you can buy. 
Then multiply this times $50,000 to see the amount it’s worth. 
The equation then is =$500/$10,000*$50,000=$2,500 
I suggest just using Excel or a Google Sheet. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:27:23
It takes several business days for your money to get to Coinbase from your bank. Coinbase won't give you the coins until they get the money to protect themselves. It's the same reason that depositing into the USD wallet takes 7 days.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:54:20
So sending bitcoin over the network always costs the transaction fee. If you’re willing to potentially wait for it to be confirmed you can get away with a lower fee usually (like $0.50). If you send from GDAX to a bitcoin wallet they pay the fee for you. So it’s not free but GDAX pays it probably so you use their exchange more often. 
Does that make sense?
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:36:55
Not dumb at all. Essentially you just make a private wallet which will allow you to control the private keys. 
I would recommend the Electrum wallet. It’ll also give you a list of 12 words which you can recreate the entire wallet with. Back this up securely. 
Then your wallet will give you a public address to receive bitcoin from. In Coinbase do the send bitcoin button and use your wallets address. I would do a small amount first to make sure it goes to your Electrum wallet. 
There’s a transaction fee each time you send bitcoin (~$2 or so). If you send your Coinbase coins to GDAX (the exchange that Coinbase owns which is easy) they’ll pay for the transaction fee to send the coins to your Electrum wallet. 
Does that make sense? It’s easy once you do it once. Look into making your computer secure too.

I think they are referring to whether your bitcoin is on an exchange or not. If it’s on Coinbase you don’t own the bitcoin (because you don’t have the private keys) but you have an I owe you (IOU) that the exchange owes you one bitcoin. 
It’s usually recommended to get a hardware or offline paper wallet and hold your own keys. Make sure you understand how it works and keep it safe. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:02:36
Happened to me too today :(
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:30:18
From previous threads on it seems most people have less than one bitcoin. Some of the early adopters have a lot more though.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:27:09
Don’t forget that bitcoin is incredibly risky. Maybe it’ll go to the moon or maybe it’ll go to 0. 
Can this family member survive without this money if bitcoin goes to zero?  Just a simple stock market mutual fund should net you about 8% a year. 
Never risk more than you can comfortably lose. 
I would recommend using your personal funds for bitcoin investing but keep the trust money for the family member in boring safe investments. 
Why is the money in a 0% savings account? Online savings account are now 1.5% or so or if buy some bonds or CDs for a 3% or so. I know that sounds boring but the money will be there when your family who you have a fiduciary duty to needs it. 
There’s financial advisors who you can pay for a few hours  to help you decide the safest places to put it. Investing should be a slow consistent boring process. 
I love bitcoin but I would never use a family members money that they need to survive off of with to buy bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:03:14
Yikes. Never invest more than you can comfortably lose. If you’re living paycheck to paycheck but have millions in bitcoin you can’t lose those coins. I would sell half and buy a house with cash and diversify into traditional boring investments like stocks. 
At least sell some of it so if bitcoin crashes to 0 someday your life is still better off.

Yeah it’s instant to buy and sell. I used Coinbase to deposit the USD which took a week unfortunately. Wish it didn’t take so long.

I tried it with a very low amount first. They pay the transaction fees so it was fine. Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:28:29
There’s you could check out. Make sure you understand that the mining difficulty goes up over time so your profits in amount of bitcoin will decrease over time. 
The mining hardware is typically really loud and hot, and you need to factor in the cost of electricity. There’s online calculators to estimate the profitability of a specific hardware over time for various coins. 
Honestly, you might be better off by using the money to just buy bitcoin now. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:37:59
Your coins don’t actually go anywhere when you submit the transaction. After a few days if it isn’t confirmed your coins will appear back into your wallet. Your wallet just shows that they’re gone so you don’t try to double spend it but they’re still there. You definitely won’t lose the coins if it isn’t confirmed. 
Sorry it’s taking so long. Things are acting unusual recently it seems. If it’s been 3 days the transaction should be canceled pretty soon so don’t worry. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:30:42
Pros are lower transaction fees for the company (credit cards like Visa charge 2-4%). Good publicity. Maybe more sales. Customers who are passionate about bitcoin might buy more often just to be able to use them in the real world so more sales that way too. 
Cons are time to get it setup and an additional payment system to keep working. Risk of the bitcoins being stolen. Taxes on bitcoin aren’t clear yet. Volatile price of bitcoin to dollars. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:21:59
Look into the electrum bitcoin wallet too. I've been using it and it's great. Lots of features, easy to use, and it will give you a 12 word seed to remake the wallet with (i.e. a paper wallet).

True and thanks for pointing it out. I fixed it.
@_date: 2017-10-30 06:02:49
It sounds like you’re doing everything right. Maybe another viewpoint is to not invest more than you are willing to lose. 
It seems that you have so much in bitcoin that it would be devastating to lose them all. You might miss out on future profits but there’s nothing wrong with selling some and keeping the money in a traditional bank where you get more protections. This may help you feel less anxious while still benefiting from future bitcoin price increases. 
Just need to find the right balance of risk and reward that works for you. It’s a high risk high reward investment and there’s nothing wrong with scaling back how much you have invested. 
I personally think bitcoin will continue to do well but who knows what will happen in a few years. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:32:23
GBTC and Overstock.com (OSTK) might be interesting for you to look into. Hopefully a bitcoin ETF will be approved eventually. 
GBTC somewhat follows the price of bitcoin just look into what the price premium means and the risk of/when a bitcoin ETF is approved on the stock price of GBTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:39:59
No there are no fees for transferring between Coinbase and GDAX or for doing a ACH bank transfer to Coinbase from your bank account. It just takes a week to clear which sucks. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:52:13
There's no fees if you're willing to wait a week for the bank transfer. Alternatively Coinbase will buy the coins for you know to lock in the price while the money is transferred but charges a 1.5% fee. You can buy with 0 fees but have to be patient enough to wait 7+ days for the bank transfer. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:25:15
Yes Coinbase is pretty safe. They even offer a bitcoin vault which you should check out which I was impressed with. A hardware wallet would cost about $100 so it’s probably too early to invest in one. 
However a paper wallet is free and pretty straightforward to do. Check out the electrum wallet if interested. A paper wallet is super safe as long as you don’t lose or forget the 12 word seed. Make sure there’s no malware on your computer. 
If you want to send your coins to a paper wallet first send it to GDAX (the exchange Coinbase owns) and then send it to your paper wallet. They’ll pay the transaction fees that way. 
Great start and just keep hodling!
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:44:24
It’s because Coinbase needs to make sure they actually get the bank transfer before giving you the coins. Otherwise you could just buy a large amount of coins with a fake bank account and then transfer the coins somewhere else. 
Bitcoin transfers are not reversible so Coinbase is just protecting themselves. I agree it’s frustrating. My deposits into Coinbase take a week too. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:05:06


No one really knows. I personally think it is better before the fork. After all the uncertainty I think the price will go higher, but we're all just guessing for now. 


Yes you would have equal amount of ~~bitcoin~~ coins on both chains. Keep in mind the exchange value of both chains won't be equal, and one chain will likely eventually die off. It's debatable which chain is most likely to survive. Safest bet is to hold and not sell either until it is obvious. 


Hopefully not, but yes there is always a possibility that bitcoin will go to zero. Lots of risks including government regulation stopping the exchanges, some technical problem with the code, fighting among the developers, if businesses never accept it as payment, etc. Some of these have already happened (such as China temporarily banning bitcoin exchanges) but so far bitcoin has ignored the threats and recovered. 
Just don't invest more than you are willing and comfortable with losing. Bitcoin is the first of its kind and the future is exciting.

To get the free bitcoin transfer? No you don’t need to.

Coinbase is probably the easiest and is likely the most common.  Check it out. They also own the exchange GDAX so you can buy and sell without fees if you use a limit order. It’s free and instant to transfer between Coinbase and GDAX. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:52:55
This is really awesome thanks for posting! 
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:12:39
Do a free instant transfer of your coins to GDAX (the exchange Coinbase owns) then do the bitcoin transfer. GDAX will pay for your transaction fee. I learned this recently and saved a few dollars. It’s super easy. 
Also if you don’t know yet, use GDAX to buy and sell to have zero fees (if you use a limit order). I recommend looking into it. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:39:07
I also used electrum and when I set the fee to the second lowest that it allows it still gets confirmed. 
I would recommend setting a low fee and also selecting the replaceable option. Then if it’s not confirming fast enough you can simply click on the transaction to increase the fee. It works well for me. Just try it out on a small transaction to see how it works.

Thanks for responding, and I appreciate your counterpoints. I actually did read the article and others similar to this in this subreddit before.
The relevant parts of the article are here:




Bank of America decided that it is likely (or not worth risking) that the government would determine that this guy is running a money services businesses without the proper licenses. The bank would be risking large fines if they did business with an unauthorized MSB.
Here is a great article (from the same website) which explains this much better than I can: 
A very relevant part of this article is that according to FinCEN:


The article has lots of other interesting points which should make it clearer.
It is not relevant that the daughter's account had no crypto transactions. They closed ALL of his accounts at bank of america (including the custodial one for his daughter).
Perhaps BOA was too cautious in closing his accounts, but that's due to the current anti-money laundering laws and has nothing to do with banks being "afraid" of bitcoin. I love bitcoin and I think it has the potential to make a difference. Just don't use a business account for crypto transactions and there's nothing to worry about. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:57:55
The guys account was closed for doing crypto transactions using a bank of america (BOA) business account (not a personal bank account). There are a lot of anti-money laundering and regulations the banks need to follow such as know your customer (KYC). Bank of America then decided it wasn't worth it to them to risk huge government fines by keeping this guys account.
Perhaps the anti-money laundering laws should be changed. This is not a bank of america problem and any bank (including credit unions) will close a business bank account for doing crypto transactions without the proper licenses. 
The bank did not close the account because they are "afraid" of bitcoin. They closed it because the amount of money they would make off this guy's account is much less than the government fines for doing business with him.
