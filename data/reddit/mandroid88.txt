Wait, what the fuck? Deposited $1000 to Technocash on Monday as a deposit to MtGox, then yesterday I got a call from my bank "confirming" my transfer, asking if I had made it. I wondered what the call was about - thought they just wanted to make sure my account wasn't compromised. Wonder if my deposit will turn up on Gox...

What made the price jump by such a huge amount in the last 6 hours? I bought in 3btc worth on Havelock and these are now worth 3.5btc ... I was in the process of moving 10+ more btc to purchase more shares but am now worried at how volatile the market may be due to this huge price increase today.

weexchange.co = Australia (they technically do US/Canada but no one uses them for that)

$86 was not hit until the last three months, you didn't buy in a year or two ago.

MtGox takes 3.45% on deposit (then the usual % to trade to BTC), WeExchange.co takes no fee on deposit or on exchange (only fee is $2.50 on AUD withdrawal). What we need is Australian bitcoin traders moving away from these places that charge 7.9% or 5% over to a system like WeEx so that volume increases and support is shown for fairer options.

I put in a 10 BTC buy order on WeEx this week at $135 because Mt Gox was fluctuating around this mark. Because I paid no fees, this was equivalent to buying on Gox at $130.30  (135 minus 3.45%) - BUT I had to wait 24 hours for my buy order to be filled. Last time I cashed out some BTC for AUD I waited almost 48 hours for my order to be filled. 
I wish an exchange had the features of WeEx (low/no fees, fast customer support, TWO FACTOR AUTH) with the volume of Gox. But I don't think that will ever happen, I've been waiting long enough.

Yeah it's a 50/50 chance, either it happens or it doesn't, right?

There is an exchange called weexchange.co that runs in tandem with BitFunder (asset market for buying/selling ASIC PT shares among others). The Australian part of it is run by Graet who also runs ozcoin mining pool. I can't reccommend weex enough, it's bloody great! ZERO FEES for depositing (MtGox charges 3.45% through Technocash) and flat $2.50 for withdrawing (MtGox charges flat $10).
Why haven't you heard of it? That's the only downside - trade volume is low as it is mostly used as a way of getting BTC into BitFunder. To be fair, the website still claims to be in "beta".

Misleading headline as this is not an announcement but a leak of info regarding future plans. Just how public the 800-1000 TH figure was meant to be remains to be seen. 
Still exciting news in any case - the AM shares on all major exchanges are definitely showing hungry buyers looking for a good deal now before this explodes and the price gets to 4+ BTC per share. If the 800 TH figure by December is true, and BFL/Avalon/other vapourware suppliers continue their current game, there's no reason AM won't be valued 50% higher than current.

In the last 12 hours I went from 16700 to 16200 - woohoo!
