That's good to hear, I'd heard previously that the company use a bunch themselves before selling to the public, making centralisation even more of an issue.
I'm a tad surprised that I've not seen any discussion of moving to an ASIC resistant system. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:55:14
non-Bitmain miners?
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:37:50
Now the important question is, do they support SegWit?
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:40:32
We need LN fast, and to pester every exchange that isn't using segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:58:46
I would have they not shut down.
Over the last week I've been checking other services I might have used to no avail, RIP.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:23:45
The bailouts are what lost any faith I had in government.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:35:56
LBX need to jump in soon on people wanting an alternative.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:38:24
Definitely liking the look of sia, are there many exchanges that use the coins?
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:44:45
From what I can tell nobody has a definitive timescale, but from what I've seen discussed a lot of progress is being made recently and it could be sooner than anticipated.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:15:57
We buy the dip
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:34:17
This was pretty much my thought process, took the plunge a few dys ago &amp; I'm already glad that I did.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:47:55
They can't tax what you don't sell.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:41:37
So could this for example be used as a way of removing centralisation from ASIC miners if the need ever arose?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:15:58
No which I'm assuming is one of the reasons for it taking so long.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:37:37
Deflation, similar to inflation that we go through with the fiat system.
A more serious concern at that point would be centralisation to those who can afford miners as they will get a cut of every transaction.

[I never thought I'd feel the need to use this in relation to BTC](
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:17:05
Given that it seems some people view this as war, yes pass me the popcorn. I love a good shitshow.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:36:55
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:55:56
I'll have what OPs having.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:10:48
Would it be possible to move to an ASIC resistant system? If so what would the pros &amp; cons be?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:35:45
This just tells us that not many received their paychecks today...
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:19:07
There's a London based one opening soon which is probably worth checking out.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:18:08
We buy the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:10:57
So is this why the price shot up so much today?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:26:38
I woke up to us having shot past £9K, finished work to this.
Here's hoping it'll help future mainstream adoption as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:24:33
The current buy wall is making me happy
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:03:16
I wonder how easy it'd be to setup a swiss bank account...
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:52:57
I'm always ok with free beer.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:16:01
I did one yesterday, I think it took about an hour or 2, it's going to be slow until people implement segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:26:43
[This has had some media attention and should be launching this month](
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:22:10
In regards to treating it as an investment, be sure to think in the long term to avoid panic sells which you may later regret.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:38:32
First time I tried was a week or 2 ago, couldn't do it then either.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:22:42
The other night I had a dream that it dropped to about 100, and my response was to buy what I could.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:53:30
I imagine GPU mining might become viable again. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:22:44
I've been debating on how I could one day convince my family to accept them at our launderette, would be a nightmare just explaining what bitcoin is to start off with, would also need to convert all the machines from coin-op to tokens.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:55:33
Scratch that we need the 13K memes ready.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:59:43
Reasoning for the recent "flash crash" aside, a sudden spike following it sounds about right.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:32:06
We can only speculate, it could be a fair assumption given that for many it'll likely be brought up especially if family remember a member mentioning it to them at some point. I've also seen mentions of people gifting family members small amounts to try and get them interested in it, not to mention "Uncle Joe decided to treat you all using some of his magic internet money profit". Nobody here can answer for certain, but if I had to take a guess it'd be "yes".
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:52:28
Just make sure he'll expect occasional dips before new ATHs
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:02:39
So about that beer...
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:41:10
Same, I'm assuming I should get any coins I have off GDAX leading up to these.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:21:19
Suddenly dying alone doesn't seem too bad.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:02:29
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:36:46
The more bitcoin that is being used for general transactions the more stable it will become. 
In this scenario the value increasing and adjusting for deflation wouldn't be much different to how people handle inflation now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:38:20
So we've got about 10 years until the UK govt catches up then I'm guessing.
