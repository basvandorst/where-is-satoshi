100% Not true. I saw this floating around. I have the charts that show high volume but clearly it isn't just longs. Believe the data or believe what others tell you. Your choice.

First, it wasn't a crash...AND...No...The total opposite. The fast drop  killed CrytoCompare. They are always yakking on their Twitter page about security, institutional investing and regulations (LOL) and this is exactly why there will be very little of that done thru these shitty data providers that freeze or fuck up when the volume spikes.

Sellers...LOL. Profit takers from earlier this week. It was only a freakin correction but it was a bit more than 3%. Are you in and hoping it goes up every day???
Very little shorting apparently, at least on CME. The short contracts dropped all thru the retrace.

The chart he was using was BTC1! on Tradingcharts. He was pointing to the wrong date and he was assuming all the daily volume on the CME were long contracts just because the volume bar was green. Typical nonsense cherry picking, pump or someone that has no idea what they are looking at.
See if this will open

Read up please. Do a search. It totally depends on what you want to do. Hold, Trade (get in and out), Spend, Swap...endless reasons to use various wallets. Oh BTW...Don't blow thru the parts in the set-up about your seeds and keys...LOL

Unfortunately it's still a democracy and Florida is run by the old money voters.

Considering their recent acquisition, that would be the VERY LAST exchange to go to...LOL

You think $4000 is tough. It it ever gets to $6000 this will look like childs play. Lots of money to be had in this space but it sure as hell isn't hodlers that will be making it anytime soon. You want to get rich quick you have to buy the one in a million shit coin and get lucky.

News???...Why does it have to be news? Look at the data, volume, short contracts etc...It is NOT fuckin news. It's people making money while HODLers wait patiently for the moon landing...LOL
Profit takers and weak hands getting stopped. Long term still looks very favorable BUT no moon shots anytime soon

Actually it was NOT. Profit takers selling from earlier buys this week. CME short contracts went DOWN during the fall.

Do you think the govt gives a shit...LOL. They will just print more and you will have less. What does that solve? A fool and his money soon part. That will be your meme...
