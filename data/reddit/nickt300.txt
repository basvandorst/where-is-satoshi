Bitcoin Gold has failed. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:13:59
Amazon was an example. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:14:43
You miss understood. I used Amazon and eBay as examples. Bitcoin Cash can easily be used for them. Bitcoin cannot. Was my point. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:18:19
Great analogy. 
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:34:48
You did a great job translating this. Thank You,

After the failed attempt to kill off Bitcoin Core by Segwit2x, then what? What will the group pushing this nonsense Segwit2x do? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:10:22
You mean the same Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin.com exclusively supports?
Bitcoin Gold is a rushed mess. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:23:32
We don't need SegWit2X when we already have  a Bitcoin Cash. SegWit2X Was nothing but trying to hijack Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is what people are willing to spend for it. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:22:52
BTC only failed due to lacking, slow &amp; expensive transactions. If they can make BTC run more efficient for example, I don't mind paying transaction fees so long as the actual transaction is FastR.
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:54:15
Amazon nor ebay would never accept Bitcoin Core as is. It would be disastrous and incapable of handling millions of transactions on a daily basis. lol

I don't believe everybody is against the actual hardfork to make the Bitcoin network much faster and smoother. The major issue I believe is the speed in which they want to push the hardfork. Such as it probably needs more testing for example. 
Will this November hardfork split the coin? IMO if this happens, I can see it crashing. I hope not. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:28:15
Just remember Bitcoin as it stands has major transactions issues and high expense. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:29:45
There's several ALT Coins that can do MUCH MORE than Bitcoin can ever do. I agree, there's a ton of get rich scheme's in this Crypto madness, but there's also many that serve a purpose with highly innovative technologies. XRP Ripple? Golem? Ethereum? Bitcoin Cash? Monero? IOTA? OmiseGo? ZCash? etc., I can go on and on. All serve unique technologies which Bitcoin is incapable of reproducing. Nothing but good old DD before putting money into anything.

It's because the majority don't pay close attention to the dealings with bitcoin. They only see its value increase without realizing how or why. 
Segwit2x needs to fail or Bitcoin as we know it will be a total failure. IMO
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:23:04
"""Bitcoin Segwit2x (AKA NYA agreement) is a soon to fail hard fork scheduled for block 494,784 to increase................"""

What's a BCash? That's obviously not Bitcoin Cash. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:25:41
You are taking his comments out of context. You should never have mentioned racism at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:13:36
Its only a network update. Nothing more to stabilize the difficulty.

Who allowed the majority of Bitcoin Mining to happen in Asia? It should be spread around, so all can vote in a fair manner. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:31:29
There will be approx: 15-20 Crypto's that will exist after all the crapcoins are flushed away. Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Monero, Zcash, Dash, Golem, Civic, Tronix, Decred, XLM etc., are IMO among the survivors. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:44:09
Bitcoin Cash are faster transactions times and cheaper. 
Bitcoin Cash can also be used for Amazon, eBay for example. Bitcoin is incapable because it's too slow and expensive.  
"""Bitcoin Cash is the version of Bitcoin that most closely adheres to the original design."""
Based on the arguments presented above, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the only fork of Bitcoin that resembles a natural continuation of the original Bitcoin invention. All Segwit chains have altered so many fundamental properties of Bitcoin that it seems a stretch to refer to any of them by the Bitcoin name.

Sega was 1st with many things. Isn't it always like that with the underdog. Those were good days. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:26:08
Bitcoin has its problems. There's no question about this. But this Hostile Take over attempt by this SegWit2x nonsense wasn't the answer. 
Good Ridden to the 2x. Only Bitcoin Cash is the true 2nd. To Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:20:43
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:22:48
The only Bitcoin with scaling issues is Bitcoin. The Bitcoin Cash fork fixes that.
