I'd donate if it was a 24/7 folding rig, but donating so some guy with a lot of money can make even more money, where it benefits no one but him, seriously?

That's a ridiculous amount of work! How long would that take??
@_date: 2013-06-16 10:24:51
That's incredible!

Holy fucking shit. That was a long read but so very worth it. I can't help but feel a little sorry for the employed writers though. I mean they were trying to make money by doing actual work for once. I also like how she tells him her God won't let him get away with this. I wonder how she thinks their God feels when they're the ones doing the scamming. I'd love to hear them trying to justify that in their angry prayers. Also I hope those documents were actually used for something like improving OCR software because if they really were in the requested format with matching page numbers they probably really are worth a bit. I doubt it though. It's a pity that the links to the files don't work anymore, I'd love to check some of these pages. It's amazing how he kept his cool during that phone call. He must have been cracking up.

Could you elaborate?

Apologies, I just spent the last hour browsing this sub's all time top posts and didn't come across it. And the fact that it's getting some upvotes means at least some people haven't seen it yet right?
[Oh and KarmaDecay found no results either.](

Thanks, that was exactly the kind of answer I was looking for. Do you have to look for and make all of these smaller exchanges yourself or can you just tell a trading website the amount you want to trade for and it does this for you automatically? Why do you have to make these transactions one after another, can't you request all of them at the same time, sidestepping the problem caused by the price fluctuating over time? I suppose this isn't possible because at any given time there aren't enough sellers to meet all of your demands at once? Or because other people are buying btc too so you can't /are not allowed to fulfill every single offer? And what would happen if the market somehow someday crashed and everyone starts selling but hardly anyone buying, would you simply be stuck with your coins or still be able to sell but just at a much lower exchange rate? Sorry for all the questions and my mediocre English.
