How often does a client pay in Bitcoin? Do you usually suggest it or do most users already know you accept it? What are Italy's tax laws concerning Bitcoin? What wallet do you use for your business?

Thanks, I'm sure plenty of us here needed a reminder to chill out

I don't see how any of the answers to those questions could be used against him? I'm merely curious how a legit business uses Bitcoin... Whether they use a special wallet, maybe there's a really good one I've never heard of for example. Also curious of Italy's tax laws particularly now, considering all the attention Bitcoin has drawn lately.
Definitely not meaning to pry, OP, just trying to engage in conversation.

You ever try building a puzzle multiple pieces at a time? It doesn't work. Little by little is the name of the game

Every single day I pay for beer at my local brewery in Bitcoin no problem, Breadwallet sending to Coinbase. The only issue is getting people to actually get a Bitcoin wallet.

Speak your mind

Not to mention the possible additional risk of the mixing service retaining your information for who knows how long.

Do yourself a favor and don't use anything related to Bitfinex

I've had some trouble using a machine like this, namely a 40 minute transfer window of funds to my wallet.

I'm not trolling. 
Consider Bitfinex's shady history and reputation for a lack of proper security. There's a reason proper exchanges (such as Kraken, for instance) haven't had any security issues, while Bitfinex continually shows their lack of proper security.
I say again, **avoid Bitfinex**. There's no reason to use them when there are a dozen other exchanges that actually do value user security &amp; privacy.
