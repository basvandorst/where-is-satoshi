Mind if I ask.  How many coins did you buy back then? I have always wondered that with people that bought so long ago? I entered at $2400 with just $200 but have put much more in around $4500. Obv, that's nothing to someone like yourself.

I hear you, but for the Bitcoin millionaires of today, what would you advise they do? I assume cash out cryptocurrency into Fiat on an as needed basis until BTC is more spendable on the basics like electric bills and such? Thanks for the reply and discussion. I've been in BTC since about $2400. So, not long. But since my first $300 buy, I have pumped a ton in and am now thinking long term.

Sorry. I'm trying to learn. Statements like this, push people away from the community. I do wish I had checked the FAQs first though. Didn't intend to be a bother to you.

Wow, this is the first time I have ever been tipped in anything on Reddit. Very cool and thank you!

I sincerely appreciate this source. Thank you.

You have given me the best answer, as I though a single Satoshi was the smallest unit it can be divided into. Thank you.

I agree. And again, maybe I should have gone thru the FAQ. Anyways, if I had known that a Satoshi wasn't the smallest possible denomination, then I wouldn't even have bothered to ask. I guess, the question still is true and we'd still hit zero even with smaller denominations, but I guess it's less worrisome.
