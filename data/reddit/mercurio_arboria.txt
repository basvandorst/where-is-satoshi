If you still want to buy them in the future, I have purchased 2 from mintcell through Amazon and they were sealed, I have not been able to detect any problems whatsoever in terms of buying from this reseller. I did see a terrible case of a person who had purchased one from another reseller with an obviously tampered with recovery seed but mintcell seems legit. (I do not work for ledger or mintcell. If anyone wants to contradict this info or warn me of any impending issues, please feel free to do so!)

You don't need to generate a new one, but you can. If you are mostly nervous about typing something wrong, then sure, use the same one if you know it works. I have done it both ways. Hope this helps!

I just read this entire thread. I am thinking that maybe it is some sort of covert advertising for a competing wallet company? Like OP is going to get another wallet and then post how easy it is to use? Or it is a bot? I just can't figure it out.

Thank you so much for sharing this story. I know there are lots of people out there like your brother. I'm not so different myself. I hope you and everyone affected by this type of situation can heal with time.

I think even if it goes down dramatically, I'm going to hodl because I still feel upset at selling when it was at $1,000 and $2,000 because I thought that was it.
And during the time when it was in the $200s I thought that was it and didn't buy. I may just have PTSD from that but I just don't think the rollercoaster ride is over yet.

One of my favorites, both then and now!
