You don't have to use it's site. You can use it with other wallets, e.g. Electrum. Also you can recover your wallet with your seed phrase at any time. Reading and understanding the basics of your tools is as important as using them. Please don't skip that (annoying) part.

…how could this fading of existence look like? I read this quite often but never saw it pictured out. BCH price can crawl down to a few cents, difficulty would adapt making it profitable again - why should it cease to exist? Someone would still trade it and miners will mine when profitable. At what point should this change (even with BCH
