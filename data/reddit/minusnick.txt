Awesome, thanks for helping me out. My friend and I are just jumping head first into Bitcoin, so it's a little murky.

Alright, I think I get that. On Multibit I just made a wallet and I can see the address (I think it's the key) as 171rhVste6g2YEjLeFc6UxtsaZH7avxwaN. I'm just gonna tell they person to send the bitcoin to that address, then I'll search that address on blockchain.info and see when the confirmation pops up. That's correct, right?

Okay I'm downloading Multibit, it seems fine for now. Would I have to transfer my Coinbase wallet to the Multibit wallet? Here's where I'm confused about the whole concept; decentralization is a little confusing for me.

I thought that a larger amount would avoid the fee as well, but according to these guys it still charges for "data" 
Since I'll be using Multibit now anyway, I can eat that $0.06, unless in the future I can figure out the fee system.

Thanks a lot. Yeah I'd feel fine waiting for just one confirmation (even though I'm certainly no expert in this field).
Just curious, do you have any experience with localbitcoins.com?

Thanks, I found my address for my Coinbase wallet. I guess I can write that down.
So I will give the person that code, and then go on blockchain.info and watch the "Latest Transactions" list. What do I look for to see that it's my transaction though? Do I check if the amount matches, or do I see if the string of letters/numbers (the hash, right?) matches something?
Also how long does that take to pop up? I read that it takes about an hour for a transaction to go through, so will I just be sitting there with my arms crossed waiting?

Actually it seems that there's a 0.0005 btc charge no matter what, so yeah I don't have enough money to send it over. Considering I got that for free, I guess I didn't lose anything. Thanks for your patience though.

Trybtc gives you 0.0005 btc (not 0.005) initially, and it sends it to a Coinbase wallet that it sets up for you. Now when I try and send the 0.0005 btc to the wallet address on my Multibit, it says what's in the pictures:
even though it still says i have a balance of 0.0005 btc
No idea what's happening here.

I have the initial 0.005 btc, and it says its gonna charge a 0.005 fee for the transaction. Does that mean I've basically lost that money?
