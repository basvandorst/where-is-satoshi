"Adoption" doesn't have much to do with price increases. 
Price increases when long term holding demand goes up (by people who save capital in Bitcoin, not spend it in stores).

My life is about I, I, I, me, me, me and the people who do business with me - like Uber. Too bad you can't do anything about it but whine and cry about how low skilled workers won't get my money anymore. 
If you want to waste your money on inferior government protected monopolies please be my guest, I want people like you to be out of cash as quickly as possible. Go find the lowest skilled taxi driver in your area and give him your salary for a 5 minute ride, you will increase your imaginary impact of transportation on economy.

No, the reason why governments ban gambling is because they fear some of the slaves would get distracted and decrease the tax output, or simply because it's competing with their contraband monopoly on gambling like state lottery.
The only thing they protect is their ability to drive luxurious cars, eat expensive food and travel around the world for resources extracted from tax slaves, all the while feeding their addiction to power and domination of other human beings.

They could make a proof of stake chain and retain 50 - 60% of the control.
What I think would happen is that people who got their hands on it would rush to crypto exchanges and try to flip the trash to Bitcoin. But after a while the currency could stabilize, they would simply threaten people into using it the same way all fiat currencies do it. Most fiat currencies are just imaginary numbers anyway.

I love the idea and I hope someone makes a slightly different version, working much more like the OpenBazaar model of exchange.
I imagine a marketplace, where customers would post a demand specifying pickup location and drop-off location. Drivers would subsequently post their bids, and the customer could choose the best offer - real time price making. Besides price offers, both parties would also suggest a list of agreeable arbiters to dispute a conflict should it arise.
The customer would then send the Bitcoin transaction to a escrow multisig wallet. Upon arriving the agreed drop-off location he would simply confirm the transaction. In case of a dispute the arbiter would come into play.
This would also solve the problem of mercantilist threats of violence, since no government could prove any financial exchange has occurred between the driver and customer. Drivers living in dangerous areas (like EU) could operate in stealth mode, not disclosing any information about the car and in case of government harassment could claim they are simply picking up hitch-hikers for free.

We live in a world where one country creates and exports banknotes, while businesses and workers in other countries, such as China, exchange their products and services for these pieces of paper. We let the creators of US dollars live at our expense, because until now there was no way we could directly trade with people around the world without a reserve currency.
The situation is slowly changing thanks to Bitcoin, a p2p network that now allows us to do business directly without the US dollar. We now have a chance to prepare ourselves and position China to be the world’s crypto-financial powerhouse. With Bitcoin China will not only become the largest economy in the world but also the biggest player in the financial sector.

In a free market nobody is forbidding you to play communism. You can gather a bunch of friends, give them funny costumes and order them around (and if they don't kiss your hierarchical ass you can declare mutiny and blow their brain out with a phaser).
Meanwhile, people with a brain understand that human desires are unlimited and resources always limited. It doesn't matter what technology is available - you still need capital to produce and maintain the technology + a price mechanism that transfers information about which desires (there is infinity of them) people prefer to have satisfied with given production capability.
If you think that communism can work if only there is some magical level of technological progress that will enable it - go ahead and try - with your own time, resources and people who voluntarily want to do it with you, and leave the rest of us do business with each other.

Absolutely, if I pay my suppliers a fixed fiat price and sell tens of products, I will not manually update 100 product prices every 30 minutes to compensate for rate fluctuations.
Not being able to specify the prices in fiat and have them automatically converted to BTC will render the platform useless for most sellers (and especially those who operate with tiny margins).
Another problem is shipping price. If I ship my goods internationally, there are hundreds of different shipping costs depending on the customer's location. Shipping prices must be specifiable in fiat too and tied to delivery address / location.

Calling facts hyperbole is not an argument.
You are right that "it has been agreed upon" what people will be forced to do / not do, except for you had absolutely no say in it. It has been agreed on by your owners, and you as a good slave will either do what they say or silently disappear from the scene. You may pretend like someone asked about your opinion but not everyone will play along with the charades. And by the way, there is no "your town" - you didn't build jack squat, perhaps you own an apartment or two so go decide how to cover costs of running it there and stay out of other peoples lives. 
I'm not surprised facts are not popular or the average slave gets defensive about them. It's inevitable and it has nothing to do with knowledge, ideas or truth. State is a manifestation of family. People approve of the state because they have been raised in families where parents acted exactly like the state - issuing orders and threatening to punish disobedience.  To survive, children simply developed subconscious behaviors based on emotional impulses to please authority and avoid damage. 
Everybody gets so emotional about this topic because it's not about the state - it's about the people that have a huge influence on their lives and challenging the state actually means challenging their history and all relationships, plus a fight against all the subconscious protection mechanisms that want to keep them away from that.

Bus drivers and delivery drivers are mostly exactly the same category as taxi drivers - try to start your own free market bus company and you will get a government shotgun to your head in almost any city around the world.
You got it exactly the other way around - Uber is not transferring wealth away from customers, it is transferring wealth from parasitic inefficient mercantilist guilds TO customers.
The fact that I save 50% of the cost is transferring wealth TO me, not FROM me. Plus now I can spend all the saved money on goods and services that I couldn't afford before and grow the economy. Transportation costs are a net minus on the economy, the aim of economic progress is to make them lower, not higher.
You say some guy went all in to acquire just 1 skill in his entire life: steer a wheel and step on a pedal - so now I have to pay an increased price for his stupid decisions and laziness to the rest of my life at gunpoint? If you make stupid all ins with your career, don't expect others to pay for the consequences (or quit being a bus driver and go work for Uber).

Last time I was in Seoul I looked at coinmap.org and went to check out 2 places - one turned out to be a fake entry (Paris Baguette in Hongdae does not exist) and the second one - Caffe Zecca - told me they don't really want to accept Bitcoin because they don't know how to put it in their accounting.
After 1 hour of persuasion they finally agreed. Then it turned out they don't know how to process Bitcoin payments. Another 20 minutes later they figured it out  and let me buy a coffee for BTC. Not exactly high tech powerhouse experience :)
@_date: 2014-03-22 03:15:36
You don't need to convert your Bitcoin into fiat. Even if you (or any other business) start accepting Bitcoin, the overall amount of customers who will pay in BTC will be a tiny fraction of the overall cashflow (especially at a place like an established bakery).
You can just keep the Bitcoin and use it to buy stuff or pay your suppliers if you get lucky and persuade them to accept BTC too (just push it every time you do business with them and you will be surprised how fast some of them will get on board).

Phone numbers in Korea are tied with identities, they basically use phone numbers as primary ID's in every online service.
The implication of using your friend's phone number is that you would have to deposit KRW to Korbit from a bank account that is under your friend's name (maybe not necessary for very small amounts).
@_date: 2014-12-06 06:06:06
You are lucky, Korea is the easiest place in the world to get Bitcoin.
Your best option is to open an account on Korbit ( and send KRW directly from your bank account. It takes less than 10 seconds to have the money on your Korbit account ready to buy BTC.
As a bonus, Korbit price is usually lower than Bitfinex and Bitstamp so you can earn an extra margin on the difference.
If you dont want to register an account just use the BTC atm in Coex mall.

Not to spoil the fun but this doesn't make any sense at all.
There are only 2 possible scenarios how this will play out:
* the blockchain will be the ultimate record of property, which will give huge incentives for private key theft (imagine you have a private key to a multi-million dollar house and it gets stolen or lost) - which average people are not willing to take
* the government will keep another database which will be the ultimate record of property, in which case it doesn't make any sense to have the blockchain for storing redundant information
The point of blockchain is to prevent control / manupulation by 1 party and resistance to government attacks - it does not compute for a goverment to use a blockchain for anything, they can just use a simple database instead.

Yes, first they are willingly born (the sperm is asked if it would like to be born and to choose a family), then 10 seconds after exiting the vagina the newborn is asked to willingly get assigned a slave ID (that happens in the geographical area into which I willingly got delivered), then at age of 6 the kid is asked to willingly enter the state indoctrination system for 12 years or get caged, and after finally getting out of that the fresh "citizen" (slave, cough cough) is asked to willingly hand over 50% of all generated resources and to obey 100 thousand pages of arbitrary rules. All perfectly willingly and voluntarily. 
And of course, it's the wonderful people who see benefits of community who are slaves, not those who are confined to a geographical area delimited by imaginary lines and threatened to hand over what they produce and obey the commands written on pieces of paper. 
Best of all, it's the people who see benefits of community by forcing other people who never asked to have anything to do with it (all completely willingly of course) to be there and obey their bs.

respectfully, I disagree. I think it's quite clear that it's the inverted elephant with a stick in its ass pattern that is the only and best answer.
Remember, every time an inverted elephant with a stick in its ass pattern is at its end, the price either goes up or down - significantly or less so. Looks like somebody really wants to make sure the price goes up, since it went up. But don't jump to conclusions yet! We must wait for a triple confirm ended by a squirrel on a unicycle pattern to be really sure the price went up - or down.

This argument seems strange, since whether someone does or does not accept Coinbase-only wallets is his personal preference and has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
Analogous situation would be if someone claimed he is not going to accept transactions from addresses containing capital C or end in even numbers.
You will always be able to create an arbitrary criterion by which you will not accept transactions on any system. Of course the government wants to spy on all transactions, this wouldn't change even in z-cash or monero. The government would simply prohibit using those systems altogether for official businesses.

Great update, especially the xPub export feature.
Do you plan to add a function that would inform user of incoming / outgoing transaction on a system level? (something like Wallet32 or Blockchain.info does).
When receiving a payment, it would be great if some action happened in the "Receive" view to notify the user of incoming/broadcast transaction - display a message or change view to make it clear that the sender made a transaction.

from 2013 interview with DPR at forbes:
Bitcoin did more than enable the modern online black market, Roberts says. It also brought him and Silk Road together. Roberts isn’t actually the site’s founder, he revealed in our interview. He credits Silk Road’s creation to another, even more secretive entrepreneur whom he declined to tell me anything about and who may have used the “Dread Pirate Roberts” nom de guerre before it was assumed by the person I interviewed. The current Roberts discovered the site shortly after its creation in early 2011. Around that time, he says, he found a security flaw in the “wallet” software that stored Silk Road’s funds. The bug could have allowed a hacker to identify the site’s hardware and steal its Bitcoins. Instead of exploiting the weakness, he helped the site’s founder fix it, gained his trust and became an active partner in the business. Eventually, the current Roberts says, he bought out Silk Road’s creator and assumed full control. “It was his idea to pass the torch, in fact,” says Roberts. “He was well compensated.”

My point to make is that I don't care about how many people are unskilled workers - it's heir choice to be unskilled. I still wouldn't care if 99.9% of people were unskilled. If the taxi driver wants my money, he can either provide a superior service or get out of the way.
All I care about that Uber saves my cash and allows me to increase my standard of living + I do more business thanks to the savings with more people I like. If, as a consequence, skilled rich people get some of my money because they provide a service I like more, then all I can say is I LOVE IT. Rich people get richer? Good for them if it's money earned by voluntary free market exchanges like Uber.
I don't care how many people lose their jobs due to automation - it's not my problem some people wasted their life drinking beers and getting stoned instead of going to the library and learning to code or do something productive (web is full of FREE resources on learning any skill-set, so nobody can make an excuse anymore).

you must also realize that different people will have completely different interpretations of what decentralization is and why they should care about it
for some people, decentralization means no center = more than 1 of X, for others it means every single user has to be a full node
the fact is that a vast majority of people (yes, the couple of people on Reddit are not a representative sample of all the people around the world who own and use Bitcoin) who own Bitcoin and use it don't care about decentralization or are much more shifted to the "more than 1" interpretation, they will never run a node and they mostly care about limited supply and great usability (I can send money to whomever I want, fast and inexpensively)
if some ivory tower academics will push their interpretation of decentralization, people will just leave and use whatever system satisfies their needs (and again, Reddit is NOT a representative sample of the average Bitcoin investor / user - don't get the impression that what you read here from a couple of people is what everybody thinks)

The point is that what you or I prefer almost certainly does not represent what hodlers prefer in aggregate.
You also have to understand that those who are willing to stick around no matter what are the ones who are the most excited to have a say in the outcome, people with skin in the game will be the decision makers in the end. This is not just about scaling but voting on how the meta decision making in the ecosystem will play out in the future. A lot of people are in for the super long run, they don't care what you end up with 1 month or 1 year after the split, plus the split gives them a chance to dump the token they don't favor and load up on what they support, possibly more then doubling their holdings.

Try to play devil's advocate and give the best possible interpretation of Roger's argument. Do you think that the best than can be said is "pushing for a particular scaling solution no matter the cost in terms of security"?
Obviously not even people who viscerally hate the Unlimited side truly believe that's what the Unlimited side thinks. How about this: people on both sides have very different affinities to risk and evaluate potential costs and benefits differently.
For different people it may be acceptable to go with a solution if there is 50%, 10%, 1% or 0.01% chance of failure. I would say it's unfair to characterize either side as going for a scenario "no matter what".
Despite how both sides of the debate see each other, neither has the goal to harm Bitcoin and both believe their preferred solution would help the ecosystem more. It's cool to argue why that not might be the case, but trying to portray the opponents as evil / crazy / intentionally trying to harm Bitcoin will only cause people to attack straw men instead of real positions.
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:41:12
I don't think loudness has anything to do with arguments. In this case I would say Roger Ver was obviously much more passionate about the topic because he has a lot of skin in the game, whereas the other guy admitted to barely owning any Bitcoin and using it 4 times a year to play poker.
My impression of the debate was 2 archetypes fighting from different perspectives - "the academic" who has little skin in the game and mostly talks about hypothetical scenarios vs "the entrepreneur" with huge amounts of skin in the game and talking about practical problems.
I wouldn't be surprised if this was actually the dividing factor in the entire debate - people who are heavily into theory and hypothetical scenarios vs people who live and breath Bitcoin in their everyday lives. Both types will view the debate from different angles.

A lot of hodlers would stick around because they have no choice (no bank accounts or willingness to open any government monitored exchange accounts / not interested to liquidate and also because they are excited about having a say in this situation).

this is what I am talking about -  strong negative emotions creating an illusion of something that is not there
In general, if someone has a behavior "no matter what" about some serious area, he would die. Such as: that guy insists on driving 150mph in every situation no matter what means he would die pretty soon. If someone behaves in a way that would cause his death pretty soon it implies the behavior is crazy, which implies he is insane. When you say guy X does Y no matter what, it's a roundabout way to imply he is mentally ill (not as an insult, but factually). 
I don't know Roger Ver very well, but he doesn't impress me as someone who is crazy. Quite on the contrary, he has one of the most successful lives of almost all the people I have seen in my life - which would be an evidence contrary to the hypothesis he is crazy (crazy people, on average, would fail constantly because their mental model of reality would lead them to behave self destructively). 
To prove he is crazy you link an article and comment on it "he doesn't care if Bitcoin becomes X", but when you open and read it it says quote:
Roger Ver is not saying that he thinks bitcoin will become Paypal 2.0, or that he would like to see that outcome. Ver is simply stating that there is a risk of that happening if the digital currency scales too quickly. He is saying that is a risk worth taking because 
You might, of course, disagree with that (I would too in this instance), but I don't think that quote makes him mentally ill.
This segwit vs unlimited debate reminds me of the US presidential debate and the anti-trump hysteria, when every other article was discussing how crazy and killer-dictatorial he would be, instead of focusing on the facts. It looks like character assassination did the exact opposite as the anti-trump side expected, why not leave it out in the scaling debate and focus on the facts?

No, it does not 'depend entirely on other currencies', it depends on current supply and demand of Bitcoin vis a vis other goods and services on the market.
Same as if people who use Ukrainian Hryvnia as money charge prices depending on current market supply and demand for Hryvnia, one time they charge X and other time Y for the same product or service.
Just because the time period for adjustments is different for various currencies, doesn't mean you arbitrarily get to call whatever you want "real" money and whatever you dislike not "real" money. Not up to you, it's up to the involved parties to decide for themselves.
@_date: 2017-01-11 05:10:24
problem is, you are not an authority deciding what money is and isn't, because it's subjective for each individual
if I and people I interact with economically decide that Bitcoin is money for us, you have nothing to say about that (it also goes in the opposite direction - if people I interact with decide that something is NOT money, even though you think it is, then it's not money for us)
it may not be money for you, and nobody has anything to say about that either

In China, the black / grey market is much more developed than in the west. Everyone knows someone who knows someone who can get things done - it's all about guan xi (the Chinese style networking).
Banning Bitcoin would make the government lose face - all the activity would just move to the black market, the only thing they would achieve is the exact opposite - people would start paying more attention if they smelled the government is scared of something.
They probably hope to frustrate and slow down the market as much as possible + try to discredit the ecosystem with state propaganda, that's the best thing they can hope for.

The argument that I am making is that all the talk about how great the blockchain is and how it will be used for this and that is complete BS. 
Blockchain is simply a mechanism to protect users from violence, borrowed from torrent architecture. It does so pretty expensively and serves no other purpose, so if some guy claims how he will create a blockchain based product to do X - he will have a massive overhead and lose against a guy who does the same thing as a centralized cloud service.
There is absolutely 0 reason to use blockchain for anything else than enabling Bitcoin the currency.

Paper wallets don't make much sense anymore (especially to average users) - either you only work with smaller amounts of coins, in which case Mycelium is completely fine and secure enough or you want to save capital in Bitcoin, in which case you are much better of buying a Trezor. Make it simple, don't introduce unnecessary complexity.

The "ocean-frontiness" of Bitcoin comes from the fixed supply of the abstract tokens = limited money supply.
There is no reason why the smallest unit should remain at 1satoshi, it can be lowered to anything in the future so there is no reason to expect scarcity there. Plus it's also possible there will be other (cheaper) off-chain / side-chain solutions developed for that.
If anyone tries to sell you on the blockchain BS, they don't know what they are talking about. Bitcoin is all about the currency / money, not blockchain.

The genius of Bitcoin is in the abstract token - since it's not physical, it's extremely difficult for malicious actors to use violence to influence what is happening with the token.
All the other uses you are talking about are generally tied to some physical asset, which basically means either you have a consent of the government, or you blockchain scheme is completely useless (it's cool to record house ownership on blockchain, won't help you much if a bunch of thugs with guns come to take it away from you).
Then to problem is that blockchain is immutable, which goverments hate - they want to have complete control over everything, so they will never allow anything to be determined based on a system they can't influence. The only reason Bitcoin is still running are those abstract tokens = the currency = the perhaps only real value of Bitcoin.
I'm sorry but all the blockchain talk is just pure BS.

Someone was just trying to give an intro into Bitcoin.. it was bad. The speaker with one hand in his pocket giving some dry statistics and irrelevant descriptions.
Nobody cares about statistics - show them how to download Mycelium on their phone. Give each attendee 1 Euro worth of coins, optionally set them up on local trader.
While they are waiting for the 1 confirm, explain why Bitcoin is superior to government money with distributed guarantees of limited supply, how it can't be seized, blocked, capital controlled, etc. and how they can do international payments with small fees.

Why do these problems concern you?
Bitcoin is already wonderfully solving a lot real problems - right now. What's the purpose of asking hypothetical what-if some possible future will look like this or that questions? Nobody will every answer that correctly - Bitcoin is a complex system and it's not possible to predict what exactly it will look like X years from now. 
You can look at what is happening now - every problem introduces an incentive for people to solve it, so far there has never been a problem big enough not to generate sufficient incentives for being solved.

I'm genuinely curious - does anyone know about a person who lost coins from Mycelium because of a hack? I've never noticed a single case and I'm not able to google anything. 
What is the chance of having your coins stolen from a Mycelium wallet vs having your real wallet stolen? If it's lower, then it makes sense to be comfortable carrying around coins in your Mycelium up to what you are willing to carry in your actual wallet. I doubt you would recommend people to put every single dollar into a safe hidden inside the wall, so why do that with Bitcoin.

There is no reason why anyone should trade the physical commodity itself. Hundreds of years ago people understood it's easier to trade property certificates - which are basically infinitely divisible. 
In the 21st century, there really is no reason why anyone should use property certificates printed on a piece of paper instead of having them cryptographically secure in some easy to access online database. You can then own 0.0001 ounce of gold / silver and use it for trading.
The only reason this is not happening is that politicians need money they can create at will, which they can't do with precious metals. Power over the monetary system is much greater than what you take in in taxes. You can also siphon-off monstrous amounts of wealth from people who are forced to use the money undetected - where do you think most people in the top 1% get their wealth from.

It looks like you didn't understand the argument, so I'll try one more time:
if deflation reaches a certain intensity, it would blow up the banking system. In that scenario central banks are likely to inflate, so expecting deflation to continue is betting on that not happening.
Hedging against deflation only makes sense if you expect it to continue in the future. Also it's not a good idea to simply keep cash balances in a bank account because in reality the money is not there. You could put some cash in a safety deposit box or something similar.

So if mainstream media is singing praises about something, that is supposed to be a proof that they understand what they are talking about and the claims are true?
None of these magical blockchain products have ever been developed - nor they ever will, since it's cheaper to implement them via a normal centralized cloud solution.
blockchain only exists to protect Bitcoin users from government threats - you obviously haven't read your history. Nakamoto institute put together a nice reading list for people who care to understand why Bitcoin uses the architecture it does and how it all started:
@_date: 2015-07-23 01:24:48
Any supply of money is just as good as any other supply of money. It doesn't matter if you have an overall money supply of X and price Y for some good, or you have 10X supply with a 10Y price.
What matters is the change in supply - when supply changes, there are those who benefit and those who lose. Paper money is used because it can be easily inflated and benefits those who are connected to the government and receive the money first + as a central bank you can charge interest on money created out of nothing. It's the best business model ever.
The common knowledge stories about how there is not enough supply of precious metals make 0 sense, they are just a sophistic argument for people who don't understand economics to not feel so bad for using government money that constantly loses it's purchasing power.
@_date: 2016-02-03 02:13:51
Yes because 95% of the money supply (of government currencies) is credit. The money that you have in the bank is in fact not there, the bank has loaned it out or used it for something else and hopes it will get paid back. If too many people try to withdraw cash or if the debtors fail to repay their debt, the system can blow up like a house of cards.
It is not improbable that in such a situation the central banks would step in and rescue the system with massive money printing, thus devaluing your cash holdings.
Holding cash is a gamble that the deflation rate will not be big enough to cause serious problems to the fractional reserve credit based banking system and an inflationary response from the central banks.
With Bitcoin you know almost exactly what the supply is going to be at any point in the future plus the Bitcoin monetary supply is pure assets and no credit, so it can never get to the same situation as the banking system.
