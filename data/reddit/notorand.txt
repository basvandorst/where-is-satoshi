Bitcoin is a way shittier "investment" than college or a house in general. Bitcoin is all speculation which you would not technically classify as an investment. Both a college and a house (when research is done) will have enormous upside in the long run. Honestly, I'm surprised this is the number one comment right now and to be frank I'm pretty ashamed of and the circlejerkery. Anyone that thinks "investing" in bitcoin is a safe way to make money is an idiot. I have no doubt crypto-currencies will succeed, but there could be a fatal flaw pop up at any time that kills a particular one. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:35:52

I just read your post and immediately went to the gas station and bought 20 $1 scratch offs. Thanks for your sound logic. And owning stocks mean you own part of a company whose goal is to generate profit. It's just too risky for me to categorize as an investment.

If $40 lost makes you uneasy you should probably get out now. It's very probable it could drop down even further and that's when nervous people sell and realize a loss.

What is the quickest time that exchanges are able to credit your bank account? I see your point if merchant acceptance became common place. Just saying people act as if PayPal fees are ridiculous.

Prolifetip: Keep emotions and money completely separate and invest in non-risky positions such as index funds or blue chip stocks. You can do this by never investing more than you're ok with losing. I'm in my early 20's and have grasped this concept quite well without ever actually losing any money from investments.

@_date: 2013-12-12 10:51:24
Well I'm trying to show you the responsible ways of doing this. You're earlier persistence of continuing to buy bitcoins was frustrating. You were not listening to anyone's advice. I don't think a single person has said to buy more and if they did, they care less about you than I do. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 12:10:24
Haha. I like your style. Thanks for pointing out these benefits. Almost about to put my coinbase account to use finally and hold til I'm 50. One more thing that really bugs me though. The 10 minute average wait time for verification. Ok so say I open a store and setup bitpay for the 0 verification method (I think that's what it's called) so I don't have to wait for 10 minutes to verify transaction. What's to stop me from getting screwed? Obviously for large purchases this isn't an issue but fast food or consumer retail definitely would be an issue.  
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:52:23
Telling other people what to invest in is a lose-lose situation. Unless they're willing to give you a percentage of their gains.

PayPal offers no fee when sending money to family or for gift purposes. I don't know the limit but I've done it many times. Downside is it'll take a few days to actually reach your bank account.

Sometimes being hard on people is the best way for them to learn. Would you prefer me say " I have so much faith in bitcoin being at $1500 next week, put all your $$ in?" Who knows I could be right, or I could be wrong, but guessing for you is not an option at this point.
@_date: 2013-12-12 10:06:45
Are you an idiot? How old are you man? Grow the fuck up and stop gambling. You sound like a whiny bitch. Your dumbass learned a valuable lesson so deal with it. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:02:11
I don't know man. I feel like bitcoin is the perfect "thing" to use technical analysis on as it has very limited fundamental value compared to actual stocks. Your experience may definitely be helping you. I mean if you really believe in yourself keep on doing it. That's the best test. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:34:08
Gotcha. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 10:40:04
Which clearly proves you didn't learn your lesson which is the fucking point I'm trying to make. Deposit into bank account and look for Craigslist jobs you can do for money in the short term. Only sure thing out there. Best of luck. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:50:06
Wow. You clearly don't need to be speculating with such a short time frame in mind. The fact that you're expecting to cash out by the 28th is idiotic. Risking more money than you're ok losing is the perfect storm for cashing out when you're at a loss. Why are people so stupid?
@_date: 2013-12-12 10:49:36
Nope, if you're referring to 2008, then if you would have bought and held through it you would be fine today. I don't know what stocks your funds you owned, but the general market has been reaching all time highs recently.

@_date: 2013-12-18 14:37:16
So are you suggesting that they are more worried about their people losing money than having control?
@_date: 2013-12-12 10:52:41
Diversify. Like I said, do some reading on if your looking for less riskier ways of having your money work for you. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 11:20:18
I've been interested in bitcoins since the Silk Road closing (about 2 months) and wanna kick myself in the face for not buying at 85 which was the price on preev when I was looking and talked myself out of it. But hey, I can't tell the future and I shouldn't feel too bad about it. And your ignorance extends WAY passed bitcoins and into finance in general. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:57:14
I saw in another speech that he suggests that the altcoins haven't even been invented yet. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:58:03
Ok. Didn't realize they handle everyone differently. Is it based on the amount of coins purchased? Clearly if you haven't received coins yet, something is up though. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 06:01:36
What is the issue with Mt. Gox? Why is there price higher?
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:09:16
You're way too emotional of an "investor" man. Just stay away from any risk with your money. This is obviously the best choice for you. By putting in money you could not afford to lose, you've proven at this point in your life you should not do anything like this as you're more of a gambler than a buy and hold type of dude. No one knows where the future of bitcoin is going, especially short term, so stay far far away. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 06:00:08

Ok. Well at your age I would hope that you have some sort of portfolio that consists of mutual funds and relatively safe long term investments, maybe with a few riskier positions such as bitcoins for shits and giggles. Head to for advice on this. But only use money that you're ok never seeing again if worst comes to worst. Now I want you to write on the white board 1000x " I will never risk money I can't afford to lose again."

Positive emotions is Apples only value? Wow. It has nothing to do with the fact they make devices that enhance people's lives on a daily basis? It has nothing to do with the fact that they generate billions of dollars in profit every quarter? Apple devices create value in people's lives. Bitcoin has the potential to enhance people's daily lives but no where on the scale of an iPhone can. I mean if I want to send money to a family member for no fees with Paypal I can do that with no fees. They created a service that gives people value. Sure I probably can't send hundreds of thousands of dollars through PayPal but how many people actually need to? To me, bitcoin's only value to me is in the hope that other people will utilize it and hopefully drive the buy price up for me. It's cool and potentially revolutionary due to "decentralized" nature of it which makes it unique from all other currencies, but damn get your head out your ass with this "emotional" value. Sorry if I sound like a dick. The circlejerkiness just needs to be kept in check.

So just wondering, even if you did get the wallet file, how would they get the password if it was encrypted?
@_date: 2013-12-12 10:25:06
No. Lots of people believe in the future of bitcoin as a convenient and anonymous payment system. If you would have just told your story and said, "Hey, I learned a valuable lesson about get-rich-quick plans" then I'd view your situation much differently. However, you keep asking about when to invest in bitcoin again like anyone has any fucking clue what the price will be next week. You need to realize this makes you stupid when it comes to finances. Yet you're just going to keep on posting, asking people for their crystal ball answers. Grow the fuck up. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:45:10
I don't think he's suggesting it's superior. Just that it's futuristic. Was this a serious comment?

That means less risk in both directions. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:46:49
I kind of think an alien society is paying Ron Paul to not be overly optimistic because they know it'll raise the price of bitcoins. They are slowly collecting funds to purchase bitcoins but would prefer lower prices.

@_date: 2013-12-12 10:27:21
I'd feel for you if you weren't an idiot and made it seemed like you learned your lesson but you clearly haven't. You're wanting people to predict the future. I think you're stupid because you think this is possible and risked more than you could lose. I have no sympathy for stupid, especially when you don't learn.
Edit: realized you're not OP but I'm leaving my comment.  
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:58:40
No guaranteeing how long it will stay this way though, so isn't it a bit pointless to mention?

Ok. So after replying back and forth with this dude I'm about 95% sure he's a troll. There's no way he can be this naive with money at the age of 42. He just created a post about buying mining equipment now. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DAVE STOP TROLLING OR STOP RISKING YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!!!
