Bitstamp and Gemini are better, but don't support that many alts + they do not trade in Tether (money without backing).
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:35:35
i copied your messege + added a second proof, hope you don't mind:








@_date: 2018-01-10 11:56:38
so basically, with BIP8 you have to signal you are explicitly against it? And 90% has to be against it in order not to be deployed? And this can be done with any upgrade? Like Schnorr Signatures which may come later this year too?
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:03:52
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:19:59
Too centralized
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:33:43
when SegWit is adopted, i'm pretty sure if it would be at 30% that mempool would slowly be declining, at 100% it would be empty in 3 days.
Then we have Lightning Network and Schnorr signatures.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:41:17
but it already is.
If you mean world currency, where all/most of the countries will use it? Ofcourse that ain't happening (not in the foreseeable future), governments want control of their money.
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:31:34
bitcoin.com is back, or at least i see it, but i know it wasn't there like 2 days ago.
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:32:56
it really depends on Tether, if everything turns out ok, then that is for sure a possibility
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:31:52
i was wondering the same thing as the user above, but can you tell me what's the difference between BIP8 and BIP148 and how Jihan can or cann't block the updates? Cuz i was pretty sure that Jihan will be blocking all updates to Bitcoin going forward and we may not be getting any updates anymore, that was my fear, that he would single handendly stop everything.
PS: We still need like 90 or 95% people to agree for the soft work to go through? Or who will be "voting"?
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:21:23
bookmarked, looks nice and easy to read, thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:06:04
upvoted your comment, cuz you da man! :D
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:57:28
BitStamp, use BitStamp :) They are supporting SegWit and bathing transactions and they do not trade in Tether, they don't have withdrawal fee-s and they are very good :)
Not sure about BitPanda, but you can do your research if they have this things or not, i'm just telling you BitStamp does (=
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:15:22
hopefully noone sends tx more then 5 sat/b anymore, so they mine empty blocks and lose money, even if it's not significant to them, but any money not made by them, is money made by someone who is not hostile against Bitcoin and deserves it more.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:10:25
ok, so if i understand this correctly, they can put BIP8 and 2 months activation period (example) and let's say 70% signal support by that time, the upgrade will be executed, people will have to upgrade their nodes and if like 60% of the nodes get upgraded, it would basically force other people to upgrade too? Would this be considered a successful upgrade?
PS: And if only 10% signal support by that 2 months, the upgrade would still be executed, forcing everyone to upgrade or we would have a serious problem?
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:43:06
Bitcoin costs 2000$ in super computer power and electricity to create 1 single Bitcoin, how much does it cost to create a US Dollar? It has to have some value.
Then, Bitcoin is backed by hundred of thousand of transactions per day.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:44:33
fiat is not backed by gold since a long time ago. They are making it out of this air, that's why it's worth around 2% less every year.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:47:23
except, Bitcoin Gold is literally a scam, they premined 210 000 coins and ran a malware on their site to steal Bitcoin-s from people who tried to claim BTG from their site.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:46:04
and there are more short positions then long ones.
This explains the dumps on Bitcoin, every time it rises like 1000$, they dump it. Wonder how long they can keep doing it.
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:06:35
dark mode in every app FTW
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:27:05
oh, i get what you are saying now. Basically if the mempool would be 10 000 000 unconfirmed tx-s, we would still have 200k+ transactions per day even if NOONE would be using Bitcoin for a month, because they would be mined still and counted as tx-s on that day, am i correct? :D If so, then you may be right.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:35:24
can you link it?
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:29:57
they can just spam the mempool with high fees and mine them back (include them into their own blocks), which means they wouldn't be losing anything, but it would still be a loss, since they wouldn't be mining other transactions (only receiving block rewards) and thus making a profit, but if money doesn't matter, it's possible and has been done before probably.
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:46:30
you should watch some interview-s and you'll see which questions to ask :P
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:31:52
people can hold Bitcoin longer then someone can afford to lose money over that kind of attack, it has happened before, it will happen again.
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:49:26
that's on Kraken and other exchanges, it's normally better to trade it into ETH and move to another exchange with cheaper withdrawal fee-s (Bitstamp has no withdrawal fee-s for example).
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:26:04
it's limited, there will be like 115 million ETH in existance in 3000 years i think, something like that.
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:08:39
He's saying market will crash and will need some time to recover, maybe 70-80% crash amd few months to recover.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:44:43
it will obviously be 100% premined and centralized. In other words, Ripple.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:31:23
mining centralization is the real issue tho (and not high fees), they can spam high tx with high fee-s and mine them themselfs...
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:30:57
SegWit and batching transactions. That's why mempool is emptying, transactions per day DID NOT decline significantly.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:09:45
what the actual f*ck :D do i see this right? To deposit using SEPA it's free, withdrawal to SEPA (meaning credit card) is 0.9€ and no deposit/withdrawal fee for BTC/ETH/LTC? :o
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:16:38
i don't think he is, 1 million seems very likely for now.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:36:10

@_date: 2018-01-08 22:59:00
no need to check, it's 15k, +- 300$ :D hopefully we see some growth soon, even tho it will be hard, because CME futures are 3x more on short then long, meaning they are shorting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:43:26

It's "Bitcoin" not "Bitcoin Core".
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:22:50
i remember a few weeks ago when BTC was rising like hell and all other alt-coins were staying at the same price more or less, ETH for example was 300$ for a few weeks and BTC was rising like hell. Hopefully something similar is happening now, when BTC price is stable at around 14k, then it booms closer to moon :P

@_date: 2018-01-08 00:30:31
BitStamp or Gemini. I personally would recommend BitStamp, because they use SegWit + Batching transactions. Gemini is not a bad choice eather (but is availible in limited countries).
PS: BitStamp has no withdrawal fee for BTC/ETH/LTC/... Not sure about Gemini tho, but maybe they don't eather, they are pretty cool guys :)
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:08:18

i once asked about this, but not because i wouldn't know how to do it, but because i'm pretty sure average person wouldn't know how to do it or wouldn't bother to do it (it's too "hard" to do it), it has to be dumb proof. Since i don't completly understand this yet, can it be done "dumb proof"? Can this be automated? Can people do this without runing a LN node? How easy can this get? Can it get as easy as downloading an app (or Ledger/TREZOR implements it) and all i do is load some BTC-s into my LN address and i send the BTC-s and that's it? Everything else should be automated or i fear this can't get mass adoption.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:43:51
no need to panic :D
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:42:24
Yeah, i'm from EU, it costs me 0.4€ to do a SEPA transaction from my mobile phone, which then takes money from my credit card and transfers it to an exchange, surely this can be done in reverse too? I didn't actually do it yet, but i guess this is how it works? :D
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:29:12
can wallets do this automatically somehow? Because if people have to manually open/close channels + everything else you just said, this will be SUPER confusing to people and the Lightning will be used even less then SegWit lol, it has to be "dumb proof" in order to get mass adoption, otherwise i don't see that happening. If i try to explain that to my father, he will never understand it and will never use a Lightning Network, he would just want to send BTC to an adress and that's it, nothing more, nothing less, everything else has to be done in the background.
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:52:18
why were you sending on a non SegWit address? Anyway, you can do "child pays for parent" transaction, which will put both transactions through, meaning you send another transaction that will pay for that transaction + the stuck one.
Google "child pays for parent electrum".
I sended 2 transactions today for 85 satoshis each and they both got confirmed in under an hour, just saying, cuz now is a good time to move funds if needed, since mempool got cleared pretty well.
PS: Ledger Nano S can do that automatically, if you are using it (not sure about TREZOR or others).
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:34:30
would it be possible in the future to have a Lightning Wallet without running Bitcoin Core full node? If not, then LN can't be mass used, because most people are not ready to do it.

you are wrong, Tether affects Bitcoin/alt coins in a massive way (much more then Bitconnect sh*t coin for example). It simulates new money (fiat) coming into crypto, if that money turns out to be made out of this air, it will have a massive effect on whole crypto market.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:17:04
nicely written, thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:11:21
i'm afraid not this time (even tho i hope so), cuz ever since CME started trading futures, Bitcoin isn't going anywhere, they are dumping/shorting it since it began trading (even at midnight when they started, there was a massive dump). Wonder how long they can keep shorting Bitcoin like that, the price goes up like 1000$, then a massive dump happens.

@_date: 2018-01-10 00:41:14
this makes me so happy :D knowing they don't have SegWit, they probably can't even implement it, cuz their devs suck and can't even do a hard fork correctly (B2X fail).
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:43:47
wtf :D
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:27:18
you are right, but if 100% of transactions were SegWit, the mempool would be empty in 2-3 days, we don't even need LN yet (it ofcourse will help), atm we just need more SegWit transactions, even with 30% i guess the mempool would slowly be decreasing.
The real problem is mining centralization tho and not high fees:

@_date: 2018-01-08 22:34:57
do you need to have your own Lightning Node to use this? Can this be simplified like A LOT (cuz for average person this is too difficult to do)? For example, can Ledger/TREZOR add this to their wallets and that's it? Is this even possible?
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:55:40
well, hopefully they don't know how to add it, cuz all they can do is copy/paste code, NOTHING else, they can't do anything on their own, if Core quited, their trash coin would literally die lol
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:19:05
yep, they did, but they are losing money because of it, even if it's not much, someone else deserves it more, someone who actually want BTC to succeed

Don't forget about Tether
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:13:33
0, because people would be desperete to change Tether into BTC for ANY amount, just to get off from Tether, which would be collapsing in price.

as many people falsely think, the problem is not Bitcoin fee-s, it's mining centralization. Roger Ver and Jihan Wu (he owns 20% of the mining himself) are against Bitcoin, so they can and are doing + probably some other bad actors.
@_date: 2019-07-02 07:06:23
You totally can mine all the Bitcoin you want in the US, but the electricity is way more expensive.
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:39:53
Batching and using SegWit would reduce feey by 80%, meaning Coinbase would be paying 80% less fees, tvey ofcourse won't decreese fees on their site, they will just keep those 80% for themself, but atm, they don't wanna even do that, making them lose probably millions in oberpaid fees, that could be their profit.
Most exchanges don't lower fees after they implement SegWit, they just keep the money they saved for themselfs.

And yet they use subreddit and not "bch" + their main site is "Bitcoin.com" and they don't find it weird or confusing.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:45:45
they want more people mining BCH and if they want that, they need to increase the price, so it's more profitable. This means less Hash Power for BTC = even slower transactions and more fees, which they hope would turn people into BCH, so they can dump on them and make some money when BTC becomes more profitable again.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:26:22
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:21:10
you would need a hard fork to do this + it is not needed, on the long run it doesn't matter if it's a 1MB block or 8MB, both SUCK for mass adption and thousands of transactions per second, the solution is second layer aka. Lightning Network, which wil work just fine on a 1MB block.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:01:21
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:10:33
no, but you are paying higher fees and transactions take longer because of that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:54:27
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:51:51
ok, i get it, just one more question :D Will Lightning Network need the same "approval" as SegWit did? Meaning (i don't know) like 90% of the network? If yes, then i fear it will never happen, because Jihan can just say "fuck it, i'm not supporting this" (because he has like 20% of the hash power) and it may never happen, is this a real possibility or not? Meaning only 1 person can f*ck up everything?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:02:01
probably yes, it should go through when you wake up :D
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:35:45
because developers understand that it doesn't have to be, block sizes are a short term solution, they do not scale enough with transactions, in the long term it doesn't matter if you can proccess 10 transactions/second (1MB block) or 80tx/s (8MB blocks), both of those absolutely SUCK in the long term when people will be doing tens of thousands transactions per second, block size is NOT the answer, this can be solved only with second layer aka. Lightning Network.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:10:50

It's not, BCH is literally ran by mafia, they have a CEO, they are confusing people on porpouse to buy Bcash instead of Bitcoin, they have ticker on reddit, even tho ticker should be BCH and then they use Bitcoin.com site to promote their coin, if that's not confusing, then i don't know what is.

isn't this what they are doing right now?
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:22:28
i don't understand that, they could implement SegWit and charge same fee-s like every other exchange does. They have fixed withdrawal fee, which will not change even if they implement SegWit. That's why it's only good to use Coinbase as a 1 time stop, to buy Bitcoin, withdraw it and never use Coinbase again, except if you wanna trade it on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:50:48
if he calls it Bcash it's Bcash, if most people call it Bcash it's Bcash. Why do you people call it "Bitcoin Core" if it's just "Bitcoin" then? :&gt;

I'm still a little confused about how easy/practical it will be to use LN. I'm confused about opening/closing channels. What if i forget to close a channel? Can it be done automatically right after making a transaction (or for each transaction)? If i go to a store and pay for a beer with BTC using LN, from my phone, will i still have to open and close the channel manually? Cuz that's highly impractical to me + as i understand (from Andreas videos), you can lose your BTC-s if you don't close the channel?

they can't use ASIC Boost on SegWit (they could on their forked B2X tho), so that's why they don't support it.

no, Lightning Network will make BCH obsolete, BCH can't compete with Lightning Network on any front. LN will have MUCH lower fees, faster transactions (seconds) and will still be decentralized.

literally everyone can run a Lightning Node alongside the Full Node + you get paid a little to run a Lightning Node if i'm not mistaken, so there will be many Lightning Nodes, how does this make it centralized? I don't understand. What centralized is this (this is Bcash):
55% of reachable Bitcoin ABC 0.16 nodes are hosted by Hangzhou Alibaba according to:

"Bitcoin will replace fiat", this will never happen in my oppinion, Bitcoin won't be the world currency simply because governments/banks/countries won't accept/allow it. If it exists in "peace" next to other currencies, it's already a big deal, since we can use it if we want to. I mean, we can dream, but being realistic, i don't think so, but i do have high hopes/expectations for Bitcoin (=

so, do i understand this correctly? Lightning network will have it's own address, just like SegWit does? And we'll have to pay "high" cost of transaction to get Bitcoin-s on the LN (just like a normal transaction)? But once it's there, it's a win-win :D
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:16:00
SegWit is backwards compatible, sonyea, you can send from non-SegWit (aka. Legacy) to SegWit, so just send it to SegWit address and you'll be fine.

i suggest you withdraw a small amount (like 5€) and be ready to lose them, but at least you won't lose everything, and if it works, then you know you have nothing to worry about.

blocks are not 1MB, i mean they are, but only if full. If a block doesn't contain a lot of transactions (the first blocks), then they are not 1MB in size, which also means if they would be 8MB blocks and not full, the size of the blockchain wouldn't rise that quickly.
For example, Bcash blocks do not take 8 MB in size if they are not full. But 1MB blocks are fine in my oppinion, as long as they don't get spammed by bad actors, luckily we can just HODL until Lightning Network (=

i'm surprised that literally 10 minutes after first Bitcoin futures went into effect on CBOE or CME (i'm not sure), price tanked from 20k to 15k, or something like this, literally 10 minutes after midnight when the futures went into effect, and yet people will say they have nothing to do with it :)

whatever you decide to do, just please don't buy on Coinbase and do not buy into BCH, almost everything else, you should be fine :) the price went down like 30% the last week, so it might be a good time to invest, you are not buying at "all time high", you are atm buying the dip.

increasing the block size is not a solution, 1GB block size every 10 minutes is NOT a solution to have 5 000 transactions per second (i made that number up, no idea how many txs/s it would be in reality). Bitcoin WILL solve all the issues it has, it just takes time, Lightning Network can do thousands of transactions per second without any issues instantly and almost free of charge, it's developing very well:

@_date: 2019-03-13 18:00:43
spoofing/wash trading is NOT allowed on other markets/stocks. It is in Bitcoin (or crypto in general), because it's not regulated. So manipulation is happening for sure.

that's not the joke, that would be called truth  
joke IS NOT allways equal to truth
Let me explain this to you, since you don't understand the concept of sarkazm or the joke. What OP ment was, that since he bought, the price drops, that's because most of the time when people buy some BTC, the price drops next day, he didn't buy for 1 billion $, he probably bought for a few hundred or something, so this has no effect on the price really, but normally when people decide to buy, the price drops the next day, because randomness, but people feel that way, that just the reverse happens then it should.
I don't know how to explain something this simple to understand, but i tried my best :)
PS: joke:
"yo mama so fat, that when she walked by the TV i missed the whole episode"
your answer:
"that's like impossible, noone can be so fat, the joke would be 'yo mama so fat i missed 0.2 seconds of the episode on TV'. ", right? because it's more realistic and can be the truth.

@_date: 2017-08-24 18:42:43
i wouldn't, the dude actually really wanted to help me, he wanted to show me how to send another transaction and pay fee-s for both transactions, this one and a new one i would have to make using Electrum. I'm assuming that's a legit way to do it, but i'm not gonna do it, since if i would have to pay 0.5$ fee-s for my 0.2$ transaction to go through, it's simply not worth the time, as i would lose more money and time to do it, it's better to just leave it unconfirmed forever.
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:27:28
yes way
@_date: 2018-10-07 11:41:54
ofcourse they are, he's losing money on porpouse, since as you said, he just collected block rewards and not transaction fees, but he wanted to make mempool bigger or something and make transactions expensive, but failed and lost money doing it.
@_date: 2018-10-07 11:39:22
none, he's losing money because he's not collecting fees from transactions. Mempool looks good, so he's not clogging it or anything, just stupid waste of money.

If mining a single Bitcoin today costs 6000$ of super computer power and electricuty, it will cost 12 000$ after. So eather price increases (because miners won't be willing to sell for a loss) or hashrate drops to compensate for it. This are the only 2 choices i guess. If a miner is selling as soon as he mines it now for 6400$, he won't be selling at a loss after difficulty increases.
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:22:33

Ledger Nano S for 70€ is not a bad choice eather
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:57:43
I "plasticified" (not sure its called that) my paper, so it doesn't lose the ink and the paper would become unreadable, also water does not damage it, then i keep the paper safely on another location and never together with my hardware wallet, so that if i lose the Ledger S or it gets stolen, it's worthless, but fire would ruin my paper yea, but if that happens i still know the PIN so i would just quickly make a new account and transfer the "money" there, cuz you can log in only with PIN

ok, i get it now, what he's saying is 1MB blocks are max. size on Legacy blocks, but that would make blocks full and fees skyrocket, but technically, it's still only 1 MB.
But it would be logical that you can fit more SegWit (and even more native SegWit) transactions into 1MB block than Legacy transactions?
But i get it, what he's saying is technically correct, even tho people would be raging right now if it would happen.

i was thinking the same, because of that if i understand correctly, mining Bitcoin should become a lot more stable now, because if a lot of miners jump on BCH their difficulty will adjust FAST and Core chain will be more profitable again, so miners have to jump back again.
This means both chains should have stable mining now, while BTC will keep majority of the miners (around 90%), but both chains can now co-exist in "peace", both will probably be almost the same profitable to mine because of that.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:48:18
yes it does.

Check B2X GitHub and tell me it's not true :) Some Core members were working with Satoshi himself, so who is better suited to implement his vision, Satoshi even said on the Forum, that biggest chain does not mean it's Bitcoin. Riger Verr (or whatever he is) has said that B2X is PayPal 2.0 in an interview, so he admited to it. And you are telling me that is what Satoshi wanted? I'm open minded too, i think OmiseGO is a good coin to invest in, so is Litecoin :) But when BTC gets Lightning, it will be enough for some time.

@_date: 2017-11-22 20:49:58
that would be because Bitmain is still the most efficient one probably + they wanna patent ASIC Boost (basically a scam), which would just strenghten their monopoly even further.
ASIC Boost cannot be used on SegWit, that's why they don't mine it. But they can mine BCH or SegWit2x (if it happens in the future) with it.

Bitcoin Cash is being pumped, because they want to make it more profitable to mine then Bitcoin, so that miners won't jump back to Bitcoin after difficulty adjustment on B2X.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:17:35
soon-ish they will come, a Japan company is making a 7nm ones i've readed somewhere (meaning they are probably better then the Bitmain 14nm ones), then hopefully other companies join and in some time, hopefully the monopoly stops or won't be that significant anymore.

i'm not 100% sure, but i think Samurai Wallet can "lock/block" that particular transaction (the BTC amount) and when you send a transaction it won't use those "shady" BTC, so noone will be able to track you/them.

What are you trying to say? Still the number one coin.
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:46:30
exchanges... they have fixed transaction fee-s, so they can make money out of it, even if transactions with 1 satoshi / byte would be going through, they would still have 0.001 BTC fee for transaction (except for Poloniex, which has 0.0001 transaction fee, 10x less then Kraken for example).
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:53:50
because Jihan Wu can only mine non-SegWit transactions with his patented ASICBoost scam operation. NYA people/exchanges will keep using non-SegWit transactions and complain about full blocks and fee-s.
BCH can be mined with ASIC Boosts, that's why they endorse it + they could mine hard forked SegWit2x too, but they cannot mine Core chain SegWit with their ASIC Boost machines.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:43:31
yet he is still attacking Bitcoin Core, because he has too much power.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:24:58
this is because they wanna sell of their stock, so they can start selling their new "TREZOR T".
Otherwise, i'm pretty sure "Ledger Nano S" &gt; "TREZOR", not sure if it's better then new "TREZOT T" tho.

@_date: 2017-11-13 14:15:24
there are a lot more bad actors then you think, NYA was signed by 95% of hashing power. Their plan was to attack Bitcoin with B2X fork, which might still happen, since BCH is not doing that well after the attack yesterday.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:14:20
when they ship it and people test it, i wouldn't pre-order it even if it was 200$. But i really do hope it's real, Bitmain needs a competition.

Ledger Nano S or TREZOR, definetly don't have it on Coinbase or any exchange, move it ASAP, you never know what will happen, so don't risk it. Especially don't leave it on Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:38:11

@_date: 2017-11-01 15:37:39
I have enugh BTC and i'm getting equal number of B2X after the fork, i actually don't mind that much which coin reaches 100k or 500k (as John McAfee said), i'll hodl both, so i don't mind that much, but i don't like the way B2X is doing this, so i hope BTC wins. I'm onto ETH too, so don't worry about me, i'm not all-in into BTC :) i'm only afraid if BTC loses and Core developers quit = Bitcoin dies, noone has so much experience that Core has and B2X has only 1 developer, who doesn't remotely know what he's doing, he doesn't even remotely have the knowledge, if Core quits, Bitcoin dies.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:06:04
oh, i didn't know that lol :D thanks for the info :P
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:13:06
if Bitcoin gets 51% attacked, then a rollback (before the attack) and a hard fork will occur and Core will have to implement new PoW too, to prevent future attacks. Until then, nothing changes. But the "not friendly" actors know that Core will do that and all they would be doing by this, is throw away an insane amount of their money.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:54:00
Why do you think SegWit transactions are so low? Because NYA "players" don't wanna use it, so they can have advantage with ASIC Boost

They can mine non-SegWit transactions with ASIC Boost, which is around 90% of the transactions.

there will come a time where you only see 0.1BTC in your wallet, you send it to someone and EVERYTHING else will be handled in the backend, opening/closing channels, everything, people won't even know how it works, just like people don't know how TPC/IP works and yet everyone uses Internet. We are getting there, but slow and steady, every coin who is saying they are already there are lying and full of crap and obviously centralized.

nobody uses BCH anyway, no wonder noone uses Schnorr on there.

@_date: 2017-11-02 00:10:06
That's not true, they changed their stance multiple times. First they said current chain is BTC, then after a week they said B2X is BTC, now they are saying B2X will become BTC after 2 weeks.

@_date: 2019-12-11 23:05:20
One question.
Since full nodes validates transactions, does this mean full nodes push transactions to miners (mempool)? Meaning i can push my transaction with only my node, even if others reject it?
Or if i wanna be sure my transaction goes through, i need a full node + miners to find a block to include that transaction into, or is full node enough to do that?
Let's say some bad guy wants to push his transaction (into mempool to be mined), does he need only the full node, or miners also?

@_date: 2017-11-01 22:41:55
BTC won't have most accumulated difficulty after (exactly) 2 weeks, because it might take more then 2 weeks for the difficulty adjustment. At the same time, also BCC will be pumped, because B2X attackers won't want miners to go back to BTC, so they have to pump BCC (and make it most profitable) and let BTC dry out, hopefully this won't happen tho.
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:08:44
You didnt get what he ment. Everything is the same, except BTC went up 18% :)

@_date: 2019-04-06 08:15:06
Well, they would save money with transactions, since this is the only thing they care about (as a company), if they switch to SegWit and keep the withdrawal fees the same, it would cost them less to do transactions, meaning their profit would be bigger.
This is how it would help them, then it would also help the entire crypto space as an side effect also.

Agree, but there will be time, when opening/closing/refilling channels will be done automatically. You'll only see "1 BTC" number on your phone and you'll scan a QR code and everything else will be done automatically (with Lightning) in the background, so people won't even know it's there. We are getting there, but such things take time, luckily i'm young, so if i have something, it's time and i can't wait to see that in action :) this is when the real adoption starts.
@_date: 2019-04-18 15:00:47

i hope it goes back down again, since i wanted to buy some in a week or two and price point below 3900 is a fantastic deal in my oppinion, since i need to buy it at ATM which has a 5% fee.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:55:35
i don't know, did they double the fee-s for withdrawal? lol
@_date: 2018-11-11 02:36:07

@_date: 2018-11-28 20:19:00
what do you mean by "double dipping"? I can see the transaction on my "Ledger Live" and it has 700+ confirmations, that's from the one i bought not too long ago. Should i be worried about something?
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:03:06
i can't decide which one would be better if i was buying now, "Ledger Nano X" or "TREZOR T", since they fixed the biggest limitation of Nano S, which was app storage, the Nano X can store 100+ apps, the Bluetooth feature also looks quite nice to me. So it's a hard choice.
@_date: 2019-01-19 11:37:53
well, you definetly got a point there.

Use protonmail or something, and when you recover the phrase, make a new, fresh and secure address and transfer everything to it, you know, just in case someone gets the file from the cloud in the future, don't leave anything to chance, but it should be safe in the cloud until you can recover it.

what are the chances of  Schnorr signature-s to be activated like ever, if Jihan (or another big player) just says "NO"? Is there any counter to this? Because without him agree-ing, even SegWit wouldn't be activated and he could have single handedly blocked it? Can the same happen to  Schnorr signature-s or any other upgrade that would be done to Bitcoin?
Or am i missing something? I'm just curious on how this can be done.

i'm pretty sure US just said "he is the president" and that's it, Maduro then said diplomats have 72 hours to leave embassy, US said "the president (we chose) didn't say anything", so if Maduro tries to do anything to the embassy, US will take military action against Venezuela (since you know, "attacking" US citizens is not allowed). BUT WAIT, i bet you didn't know this, but Venezuela makes 1.2 million barrels of oil per day. Venezuela has oil, i'm pretty sure this has nothing to do with it tho and US is just trying to make the right thing here, i'm sure their chosen president wouldn't sell them cheap oil or hates US in general.
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:09:28
no, you scan QR code on your phone (your address), put in the money and that's it, the Bitcoin is sent to your address. End of the story.
It's more expensive, because ATM owners will take a fee out of it, but it's anonymous, because noone knows you bought it, except for the cameras, if there are any :D
@_date: 2019-01-18 20:03:31
Personally i'm not scared of any attack that has to happen if someone needs to have phisycal access to my PC/hardware wallet, the odds are just too slim, i would win lotto before someone doing this to me, especially since i'm VERY careful about such things.

Everything will be fine, i bought the most at 3600€ (previously at 1650, 1900 and 2000€) :) and i'm not panicing, the only thing that will make us lose money is if BitCoin goes down, which i'm not even sure can happen.

Everything will be fine, i bought the most at 3600€ (previously at 1650, 1900 and 2000€) :) and i'm not panicing, the only thing that will make us lose money is if BitCoin goes down, which i'm not even sure can happen.

if you buy 1 ETH mining power per day, they probably make 1.5 ETH per day with your money and take that 0.5ETH for themself. This is why, it's allways better to get your own rig and keep everything for yourself :)
@_date: 2018-11-11 15:47:29
sell some if you need the money, if you have enough and have a steady job and owe noone the money, keep it for a few years, you are gonna be a very happy man then.

my guess would be, he's talking about this:
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:25:01
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:17:12
Are you saying they will automatically copy all transaction made on BTC to their S2X?
“They will have 0.15 nodes running that relay all transactions over into the segwit2x network automatically.” 
I don’t quite understand what this means? I’m just trying to understand what will happen.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:21:09
they can't fully regulate it, but they can try to make it legitime and regulate it a bit, such as US, people don't have to report buyings with BTC that is less then 600$ i believe. I consider this (if it's true) a good news, since believing every country in the world will just let BitCoin be was too much to expect, but a little regulation doesn't hurt i guess. They still won't know how much BTC a person has or what "cheap" things people are buying with it. But if you buy a house it will be suspicious, so it's a common thing to report that i guess.
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:12:07
BitCoin mining is illegal in Venezuela, BitCoin will not replace their currency. Stop believing everything you read without doing some research.
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:17:34
so we just have to keep our BTC-s in a hardware wallet and then somehow check which chain an exchange supports before sending BTC to an exchange? Is this the safest way? (=
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:49:08
i'm not sure i understand that in the detail, but i allways though it would be like this, but i believe you :P i'm not an expert, it's just what i though, because i though if they have all the coins and they sell it for 5000€ each all the time, price probably won't go below 5000€ cuz noone can get them cheaper :D that's just how i was thinking and i'm probably wrong too :P
@_date: 2018-02-28 08:59:08
If i'm not mistaken (which i might be), but i though when Coinbase activates SegWit, everyone will get SegWit addresses and there will be no way to use legacy addresses, meaning 100% of Coinbase users would use SegWit, is that not the case and people are able to choose?

Satoshi himself has at least 1 million BTC (that he never moved and probably never will, cuz this would mean BitCoin price reduce, if he's still alive, noone knows), then there's a guy that lost 300 000 BTC while mining early days ( and there are countless more stories if you just google it.

i'm pretty sure if a bank would issue their own cryptocurrency they would premine 100% of the coins, meaning they would have all the coins in existance to begin with and then offer (sell) them to the users. There's no way they would give anyone "free" money.

i just have a "noob" question (just to be sure).
When BitCoin Gold / SegWit2x fork happens, does it matter on which "chain" you have you BitCoins, by that i mean, does it matter if it's on "Legacy" or on "SegWit" one? Can you have some on "Legacy" and some on "SegWit", or all on eather and you'll still receive full amount of new alt coins?

@_date: 2018-02-08 17:05:37
while that is true, the same thing you could buy on those ATM-s (coupons) can still be bought on every Petrol gas station, which there are hundrets across the country (much more then those ATM-s), so it's not a big hit + the banks allow deposits to exchanges, they are not baning deposits, so it should be fine.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:30:50
miners will stop mining it, the difficulty will lower and miners who have cheap electricity will mine it with a profit.

i doubt it, an ASIC miner is still like 50 000 GPU-s probably, but if they attack it and Core devs must change Proof of Work alghoritm, then it's possible they'll change it to GPU mining yea.

"In the coming weeks — nearer to the date of the fork — we will provide a more detailed plan for how Coinbase will approach naming the two Bitcoin blockchains."
They did not say how segwit2x will be called, and it may as well be "BitCoin", which means it will be called BitCoin on GDEX too = everyone should stay awqy from them until they explain it + they are on the list of NYA signers.

Don't buy on Amazon from resellers then, i bought from their own site/store for 70€ as i said, it's cheaper then TREZOR. I'm sure you can find it cheaper if you don't buy on Amazon, i think Ledger has resellers listed on their site too, so that's a good start, there must be some from Canada who sell it for normal price.
EDIT: here for example:
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:42:41

the price will most likely go down, because people will transfer BTC to alt coins again, since they were doing the opposite now, to get free sh*tcoin B2X.
Just see what happened on October 25th (Bitcoin Gold fork), the price dropped by 10% the next day as people were trading BTC back to alt coins. I don't think enough people will be droping B2X into BTC for the price not to fall, at least it didn't happen with Bitcoin Gold fork.

because core developers say it's NOT needed and they can scale BitCoin with SegWit and Lightining Network to new heights, meaning thousands/millions of transactions per second.
SegWit2x (2MB block size) just wants to get rid of Core Developers by doing their own fork basically for no reason then controll over BitCoin protocol.
EDIT: who you believe is up to you, but i'll stick with the team that is developing BTC from day 1, instead of some mega corporation (BitMain).

Coinbase is in NYA, so you should stay away from it, because your Bitcoins won't be the real Bitcoins after the fork...
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:32:57
if you are planing to invest quite some money in BitCoin (let's say 300€+), you should definetly get the hardware wallet (Ledger Nano S or TREZOR) and store your BTC there, if you control your private keys, you will also get the other coins after the hard fork, if i'm not mistaken, Coinbase did not give anyone any "BitCoin Cash", if you would have BTC on your Ledger Nano S, you would have gotten the same number of BCC (BitCoin Cash) as your holdings in BitCoin.
And hardware wallets are FAR more secure then storing your coins on an exchange. If Kraken gets hacked, you are out of luck basically.

i'm not gonna store all of my money on the smartphone probably ever. If BitCoin would go to the moon and i would be using a TenX card for example, i would just send small amounts to the card allways and then spend it in a week or so, and then send some more BTC for a week again, and so on... I feel like this is the safest way, do you even control your private keys if you store your BTC on the phone?
(this is how i was thinking of doing it in the future) Something similar as i am doing right now with online payments, i have a Visa for online payments that is NOT "connected" with my main card, so i'll just send the amount i need to the Visa card and then pay with PayPal or directly with Visa (Amazon).
This way, there's no chance of me losing all of my money at once, or at least a minimal risk i guess.

Depends on the structure of transactions, optimized transactions "cost less" then non-optimized ones and thus you can fit more into the blocks. It's not everything about block size, first there needs to be improvements that optimizes and reduces the transaction sizes itself, which SegWit did, Bech32 does it better and Schnorr will do it even better (if i understand this things correctly).

I agree with you, but only in one thing, it's MUCH MUCH easier to manipulate dominance downwards, but not upwards (except if you remove alt coins from Market Cap site).
This dude explains it pretty simple, because gaining BTC dominance means all altcoins have to go down, while BTC has to go up, but making some sh\*t coin with fake market cap is so much easier to do, then throwing billions to BTC to gain BTC dominance.
But i don't wanna argue anymore, thanks for modding the sub and coding for the better of us all!

i wish BitCoin would be minable with GPU-s, then it would be much harder for them to make forks, since they own the majority of the ASIC-s, they can literally fork BitCoin every day if they want i guess...
@_date: 2018-07-20 08:50:17
he said it pretty well
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:35:08
f*ck it, i'm making "Bitcoin Diamond", it will SOLVE all the issues, it will be mined with shoe ASICs only, those:
it's gonna be great! I already have 5 000 000 of 21 000 000 ever released, so stay tuned while i farm some more!

Bigger picture, so you can actually see something:

damn, this is worth the watch
@_date: 2019-09-27 08:13:34
I'm not complaining, but i would bet it's not gonna go below 5k (even tho i kinda hope it will, so i can do one last big buy).
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:28:38
i don't know, but do you watch Discovery and the show "Gold Miners"? :D They get like a few million bucks worth of gold each season, but this also requires some serious investment in the equipment and if you are out of luck, you could actually be empty handed, while mining BitCoin is probably more safe, since you can't be unlucky and not get any BitCoin while mining it i guess :D

you can do what this guy did:
@_date: 2018-07-25 16:07:07
why do you continue to work for 2$ per month, if you have internet access at home (slow one) and you can make more money per month with it + you would have more time to help people if really needed.
Do you have any family members outside of Venezuela, who could send you those 2$ per month if really needed for example, so you wouldn't have to work the whole month for basically nothing?

@_date: 2019-09-27 15:26:18
Did i get more then 10% return per year on the initial investment, HELL YEA, rich peoole are aiming for 5-8% per year, buying Bitcoin was a better decision then buying Gold or S&amp;P500 stocks, so i'm happy.
If it gets lower, ill buy more, i know what my target is and how much i want to own, then i won't buy anymore and i'll buy some, LISTEN TO THIS, Magic the Gathering cards, yes, i'll invest in a card game, i'm a crazy person, Magic is going to 0 also, f_ck that crappy game.
If i lose my money, will i be homeless? No. Will i lose my car? No. Will i be able to pay my debt? I don't have any. Will i lose any life standard i have now? No. But if i win some, i'll buy a Tesla and continue living as i am now :) everything the same, i'll just drive a Tesla :D i don't need or even want a lambo :)
PS: i'll consider selling my BTC when it becomes illegal in Switzerland :)

Why don't they simply call the BitCoin chain thats coin is worth the most "BitCoin"? (=

I hated Elipay when i saw the news, but they still offer BTC payments also, so it's ok i guess, until they start doing shady stuff. But he paid 4 million $ to them, so no idea what he got for this.
@_date: 2018-07-20 08:47:18
this guy gets it.
Even if BTC has a 10% dominance and there are 20 000 coins out there and ETH has 4% dominance, i would consider this a huge success and an impressive one.

With all those money printing it's true, i know what you mean
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:34:50
hey, i know i'm answering late, but i didn't understand the difference between paying someone every day or when the contract closes (meaning 1 time payment when contract expires vs paying the differences every day, if i understood correctly what you said), isn't it the same at the end?
And can you explain to me what happened today with Bitcoin short sellers, since Bitcoin went on a flash bullrun.
"Liquidated short on XBTUSD: Buy 9,984,230 @ 7650"
first question, does "Liquidated short" means that long position won? If so, what does the other things mean? :D How can i calculate how much did that person lost/gain?
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:46:10

Noone said the fight is gonna be easy, but remember, BITCOIN CAN NOT BE STOPPED, it can be regulated, but it can't be shut down, it will allways exist. Skype, AirBNB, Uber, ... Were illegal too at one point, now they are kinda standard.

You should buy before the fork, but expect price to drop after the fork, so don't panic :)
@_date: 2018-04-05 00:14:57
Cheaper, faster and more secure.
@_date: 2019-09-29 13:15:47
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:30:10
if he was forced to buy $9,984,230 worth of Bitcoin @ $7,650, wouldn't he be actually in profits now that the price is 7700$? He can sell for that and he's in profit (theoretically)?
A lot of people were saying that this means, that the dude actually lost 10 million $, meaning his leverage was 10 million and he didn't/couldn't put a bigger margin (as you said, it was very fast) and he got liquidated for that 10 million, which is 10 million loss for him? :D
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:31:47
because raising the block size to 2MB cannot be done (realistically) without a hard fork, that's why we got SegWit, which is a "software fork".

DAI ( is the real deal (true decentralized token that will always be worth 1$, or very close to that, just like Tether for example), i REALLY hope it gets widely used and replaces Tether and "Real USD" in the future.
PS: it remained stable at (close to) 1$ when ETH was 1400$ and fell to 400$.
@_date: 2018-04-03 00:07:45
All of things you mentioned.
@_date: 2018-04-28 20:19:17
normally when BTC rises, alts rise a little more, but when BTC price goes down, alt drop more too, so... you do the math
but since BTC is the king, no alt can surpass it's market cap in the near future :)

they wouldn't, but 90% of people in America would stay away from it, so it would be a blow, BUT when US Dollar collapses or next recesion comes things would be very different.
I don't even know how they plan on baning all crypto, there are MANY coins (ETH etc.) who are not only currencies, but much more, but can still be used as currencies if needed. So i don't even know how they would plan to do it. There are just so many use cases for crypto and their blockchain i don't know how they could do it. Also, there are people who are saying (i'm not from US), that Bitcoin is legal right from first amendment (that speech and money count as the same thing) and they can't ban it eather way.

I'm pretty sure one of major exchanges doesn't support SegWit yet, and if i'm not mistaken it's Binance. I may be wrong tho.

It does, it takes the load of BTC blockchain, because exchanges are using it, without it, we would have had more tx-s in mempool, also Lightning helps, so we are better positioned now then the last bull run.

@_date: 2019-05-15 22:23:54
BTC can handle more transactions then it could the last time, so the same bullrun wouldn't be so drastic on the fee-s. However, it can't handle all the transactions, so people will need to get familiar with off-chain transactions, Liquid, Lightning, atomic swaps, etc.
But Bitcoin might handle all the transaction the next bullrun (after this one) hits.
@_date: 2019-05-08 10:43:23
can someone explain how could they even do a rollback on the chain?
How many miners would they need? CZ said he could offer each miner who found a block 300 BTC (instead of 12,5 which they found), is that enough to rollback the chain or what? Other miners don't matter or what?

PS: go to [ click on some random transactions and you'll see how much people could have saved in fees.

"This transaction saved 41% on fees by upgrading to SegWit and could save 16% more by fully upgrading to native SegWit-Bech32"

Nothing happened, also nothing happening when BTC drops. It's pure manipulation and long is winning. Obvioisly 8000 to 8600 in minutes is not organic growth. But here we are. When BTC was 3200$ it felt like nothing would move it upwards, even if the news were positive. Price does not reflect news anymore.
