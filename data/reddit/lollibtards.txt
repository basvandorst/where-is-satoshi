Coinbase have been bcash cohorts all along.
They recklessly backed 2x.
They intentionally propped up the price of bcash by not letting their customers dump it.
They are obviously complicit in insider trading.
They are probably technically insolvent:
They are still making pathetic excuses to delay using segwit.

How can I be repeating myself in my first post?
1 is a whole number, so is 5.
People use 1 and 5 USD notes.
Imagine that a billion dollars is is called a bilcoin.
See how that has absolutely no impact on 1 or 5.


How ever do people cope buying something thats 99c or 9.59 then?

Same for Ledger, but Ledger had it working on the day.
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:08:47
...Because you can't do the exact same shit. You will never achieve the same level of security with a software wallet.
If you have 100usd worth of BTC it's not necessary.
Once you have tens of thousands or maybe hundreds of thousands of USD worth of BTC it's insane not to.
With a hardware wallet your private keys never leave the usb device.
Even on a pc infected with whatever trojans you like, your BTC is totally safe, every transaction has to be physically authorized on your Ledger/Trezor.
Long story short, it's by far the most secure way to hodl your coins.
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:45:52
I always understood it as... You bought 1 BTC at 3000 usd, when BTC is 4000 usd, you then trade said 1 BTC for  10 ABC shitcoin at 400 usd each. You just realized gains of 1000 usd and it's therefore taxable as capital gains. Unless you're a trader where it would be taxed as income.

No problem, just restore your 24 word seed to any compatible device/wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:19:37
Except when you make it you're potentially exposing the private key, same again when you have to import the private key to spend it, then repeat the cycle all over again.   Hardware wallets solve these problems. Your pc can be brimming over with trojans and your coins are still 100% secure.

True. It's like... I wanna buy something today that costs 250usd worth of btc. I buy 250 usd worth of btc and make the purchase,  it cost  me 250usd. I lost nothing.  Other than in the sense I'm losing 24/7 all the time I'm holding any kind of asset I'm not immediately converting into btc to hodl.

Yeah, but... that'll no doubt be on a capped amount (few thousand usually).  Making it kinda pointless if you have say 50k you want to put to work.  Even if you stay on the case with ISA's, you'll probably not find better than 2%.   Inflation at a claimed 3.5%, in reality it's more like 7.5%, but they hide it by shrinking products etc.
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:38:20

Full nodes validate transactions on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin has this longest-chain rule where the chain with the most work in it is the one that everybody follows, except this chain also has to follow all of the rules that the network has. The full nodes are the ones that check that the chain follows the rules, and if a chain doesn’t follow the rules, it doesn’t matter how much hashrate is behind it, that chain is ignored.
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:21:01

Ok, let say I'll give you the fact that this time isn't different... The fact still remains that right now never in the history of btc has anyone that bought the ath lost money,  as long as they hodl'd.
I'm not saying we won't have correction/crash, but to claim btc's situation isn't different this time is incorrect...Even msm is starting to pump it, well, relative to before... The mainstream adoption S curve, if/when it happens will bring daily price increases inconceivable to most people now...

"People were saying this same shit in 2014... as Bitcoin hit $800. "you'll be fine - just keep hodling... nobody has ever lost if they just keep hodling". Then it plummets to under $200, and it proves that this was the stupidest advice ever - you could have 4 times as many coins if you took a step back at $800, and bought back in at $200."
Where did I say it was the best course of action, or that they couldn't have made more if they were some kind of crypto genius like you?  I still missed the point where they lost money if they hodl'd... " If they hodl'd" isn't a cop out, it was a fundamental part of my statement.   
People who bought this ath, will not lose money as long as they hodl.  Just like previous ath buyers have never lost as long as they hodl'd. That's a fact. Unless you're asserting that btc will never pass the latest ath.
I even said more than once about the possibility of a correction,  but you seem hell bent on creating strawman snake oil salesmen who are screaming it's impossible btc will ever go down even momentarily.
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:04:14
Except it's not 2013. I know what you're saying, and there could be a correction... But it's an entirety different situation now than 2013.  Infrastructure,  awareness, and perhaps most importantly there's now a real feeling BTC just 'works', tried and tested.

So if someone outplays you, kills you and takes your place and everything you have you shouldn’t really mind, because natural selection.
No, you should mind, it's your job to outplay them and not let them take what you have... because of natural selection.
We have fundamental different views of life, I’m glad most humans see things the way I do, we’re not in a jungle.
Clearly they don't though otherwise the money wouldn't have to be stolen from you under threat of violence/being put in a rape camp.
Humans are trying to be a superior species, we’re more than just natural selection, we are ethics, morals, intelligence, love, compassion, ingenuity amongst so many other things.
Bullshit, people want to appear that way, but sorry it's just not true.
 Take away the police and the strong would eat the weak within days. Not to mention about 8 people own more wealth than the bottom 50% of the planet's population. Hardly anyone actually cares or they'd do something about it.
Btw, a person with a disability can in many cases have perfectly healthy children. Ideally we want healthy bodies, but don’t forget about healthy minds.
That's true but then the child becomes a burden on the taxpayer.  Making them less likely to feel they can afford to have kids. So essentially we're enabling the weak genes to reproduce at the expense of the strong not reproducing. Sounds like a great evolutionary move huh.  We're completely going against nature and wonder why everything is turning to shit...
One of the greatest human minds alive today is Stephen Hawking, he did more for mankind than you and me, probably more than most of reddit, and you know the shocker? He has a severe disability, according to you he should have been killed when he was born or something, think about this..... maybe you should be the one to die? What did you do for mankind?
Now you're just putting words in my mouth, where did I say anyone should be "killed at birth"?
Indeed that would go against natural selection, which my whole argument is in favour of.  
I'm not pro or anti disabled people, I'm totally neutral. Good luck to them, but not at my expense.  Even that's not exactly true, like I said, it's sad, maybe I'd choose to give voluntarily, maybe not, but that would be *my* choice.  Having my hard earned money taken from me against my will is wrong.
Maybe I should be the one to die... that's exactly my point.  I'm making my choices with possible outcomes in mind. I don't smoke because I don't want cancer. If someone else decides to smoke and end up with cancer from smoking. Not my problem.
What did I do for mankind? I don't burden it. I'm not a parasite.
Which is more than can be said for a lot of people.

  Where did I say I think BTC will be trading at $500,000 within 3 years?
Could your precious Eth not be used to make a smart contract for the bet? Or is it solely used for ICO scams...


 I don't want to put money on anything. I'm happy just holding BTC, but thanks for the suggestion.


Eth is a shitcoin, controlled by a private company/counterparty risk, flakey details on coin cap/inflation, has already proven it's immutable ledger is absolutely mutable, all aspects subject to change at any time on the whim of some Russian kid or his puppet masters.


The only reason any money is going into these shitcoins is speculation, to accumulate more fiat or BTC. Drivechains will begin the great shitcoin cull.

The massive amounts of power used is what gives Bitcoin it's value. It's literally based on the concept of mining gold.  It has value because it *can't* be created out of thin air.  This value represents the energy used to find/create that bitcoin/gold, and also the time/energy of all the people that were mining for it and didn't find it.  
Personally, I consider it a good thing that developers can't suddenly change the rules on me when it comes to storing large amounts of wealth yes.

And who should pay then? For the ones that can’t pay for themselves?
No one should be forced to, perhaps if your "everyone cares" theory is true people will give voluntarily what is taken from them by force now... but we know that wouldn't happen.
I’m not putting words in your mouth, you’re the one saying they should be abandoned to their luck, that includes the possibility of death, by cancer, other illness, disability, bad luck or whatever.
All of which is very different from killing disabled people at birth. 
One is murder, the other is nature.
Just saying I'm not putting words in your mouth doesn't make it so, you absolutely were:  "according to you he should have been killed when he was born or something". 
You’re not a burden for now, and you’re saying that about yourself, others might have a different opinion.
I kind of doubt that as I don't rely on anyone for anything.  I see it that I need to keep it that way as it's not other peoples responsibility to look after me.
You keep talking as if I'm affording myself special dispensation or am somehow oblivious to the fact I could be injured etc. The reality is quite the opposite, as set out in my last message.
Some extremists could consider you a burden, be it for your ideals, for your looks or whatever, then what? Natural selection and fuck you?
Anyway, we won’t get anywhere with this, that much is obvious.
Extremists could consider someone a burden for their looks? Ideals?  That's pretty abstract.... but yes, if they take exception, there will be a conflict and the stronger/better will win through. That's what evolution is all about...
I'm presuming you wouldn't feel it was right to outright steal from people, so why does using the state to do it on your behalf make it ok.... because that's exactly what it is.  Deadbeats vote left for "free"  stuff. Shocker.

Whether they are NO2X or not, any good HW wallet will support the chain in the sense they will provide users access to their coins.
As I can see from the UI ledger has preempted support for the 2X chain right back from before the Btrash split. 
In principle it's good to support NO2X companies, but with HW wallets they aren't in a position to change your coins in the sense that an exchange/broker could sell you 2X as BTC.
Unless I'm missing something, which is possible as I'm pretty tired right now.

Bitcoin can take anything good on board, using sidechains, that you conveniently chose to ignore.
"bitcoin will never be anonymous"
Again, see sidechains. Even Lightning in many ways can solve this issue by keeping most of the small transactions off chain. Confidential transactions are on the way. For now just use a mixer, ya know unless you're not a drug cartel member, in which case it doesn't matter much.
LOL bitcoin is not considerably centralised.

You just keep saying the same thing, without any explanation of why.
You seem to think the success of BTC is exclusively dependant on poor western investors. Whom for some reason you continually assert have little incentive to invest. 
Firstly,  bitcoin is a global value exchange system.  People do and will increasingly use it not to make money but for that reason alone. A significant part of the earth's population is unbanked, bitcoin is the first real opportunity for them to help themselves.
Secondly, these western investors you keep saying are sure to scoff at the low returns offered by bitcoin investment...
What on earth do you imagine they are going to turn it down in favour of.  The other investment opportunities with returns greater than bitcoin?   
Why don't you help out the little guy and list a few here.
There's just no logic to the idea that a poor person isn't going to make an investment unless they're able to make enough money to retire on from it.

By virtue of the fact alt coins exist at all, bitcoins dominance had to drop. Being the first,  it's dominance obviously started at 100. With thousands of alts it's actually pretty amazing it didn't drop further than it did. 
Let's not forget  it's huge surge now is inspite of the creation of bcash. Which overnight materialised as one of the largest market cap coins, and is still the 4th.

Only in the sense that you need to know it to access the coins.
The problem is you have to write it down somewhere.
If someone gets hold of it, they have access to all your coins, they don't even need your hardware wallet.
A passphrase is actually a 25th word which creates a new seed.
This means if someone gets hold of your seed they would still need to know your passphrase.
On the nano s you can even attach a pin number to a passphrase, so that you don't have to type a long string in every time you plug in.
Perhaps this makes it slightly less secure, but probably not in any meaningful way, as the device will wipe itself after three incorrect pin attempts.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:10:37
Although the passphrase attached to pin is exclusive to ledger AFAIK?

We aren't necessarily talking about "someone" though. 
Wall Street is coming and it's institutional money that would take BTC to such highs.
"What happens if fiat were eliminated from society and Bitcoin was only accepted?"
Then bitcoin would have exceeded a value equivalent to 500k.
"As the price increases, there is little incentive to invest because the potential for any returns is significantly less in Bitcoin's fixed system"
You keep just saying this as if it's fact. What do you mean fixed system? Why is the potential for returns significantly less? Less than what?
You mean because some very early adopters made massive gains? That's literally how capitalism works, you get there earlier than the next guy you make more money.
"late adopters own less Bitcoin than others as the prices increases"
And your point is what?
"Whereas with stocks, there are continually new and emerging business that may or may not succeed, but they still provide opportunity for growth"
How does BTC not provide opportunity for growth?
Again, the question is "Does anyone think a $500K price is in the realm of possibility?"
It's not "can individual investors retire early from bitcoin investment?"

"Ethereum will always have more consensus failures than bitcoin. It has a larger attack surface, and competing implementations.
Ethereum will always be more risky because they abuse the “default option” power over apathetic nodes. Thus any regulator can just have them make aml/kyc/sec reg a requirement and bye bye efficiency.
Ethereum will always have more down time than bitcoin, check out 2017 for instance. (see point 1.)
Ethereum has 3x less reddit users, a couple x less twitter mentions, a few x less wallets, a few x less press, a few x less years of testing, less hardware wallets, less adoption in nearly every way. Where can you spend this “currency?”
Ethereum tricks developers into losing far more money with “smart” contracts that have bugs, than bitcoin does with accidentally sending change to the miner instead of to a new address.
Smart contracts will always be dumb as long as you have to trust a signal from the real, non digital world (oracle problem.) If you have to trust any way, then just let the oracle do it all.
There’s nearly no demand for the Ethereum gas you’re supposed to buy to process transactions, because no one really uses it for computing, it’s just speculative platform utility. Gambling on gambling. Which just got banned in china.
Their blockchain is bloated. It grows faster than many users can download it. It’s transactions per a second is maybe 3x bitcoin’s. It’s very likely sharding and other solutions will not “work” if you care about immutability/trustlessness.
Ethereum is more centralized, more risky, loses more of peoples money, down more often, and always will be."

Yeah, but I'm not wrong though am I...
Indeed, you started your first reply with "i don't disagree".
(Instantly giving anything you have to say less weight in my eyes due to lack of basic literacy.)
Essentially you've gone from your stated position being: "i don't disagree" to: "sorry i just had to explain why you're wrong LOL".
(There's that ignorance regarding basic literacy again; curiously the LOL is capitalized though.)
Can you see why you're not making much sense? You seemingly can't decide whether you agree or disagree... Sadly, it only gets worse going forward.
"you could say this about virtually any investment"
Of course you couldn't. The very fact you would make such a  ridiculous assertion only confirms what the lack of basic literacy had already indicated. You're just not that smart. Sorry, but people aren't obligated to spoon feed you due to your lack of education/IQ.
Let's say there are maybe 13 million available coins, due to Satoshi's million and burned coins/lost keys.
There is estimated to be around 7.5 billion humans... That would come out at about 0.00173 BTC per person.
Let's make a conservative estimate of say $20 trillion worth of global currency in circulation. 
If just 5% of that went into BTC we'd be at about $77000 BTC.
Of course, that's just currency. We also need to factor in other asset classes, like gold for example... I'm sure that's probably another 6 trillion right there alone. 
Do you see where this is going yet?
Perhaps this visual depiction of S curve adoption will help:
Clearly, BTC is at worst only just entering the early majority stage, it's probably much more accurate to say we are still inside the early adopter's stage. After all, the target market is everyone, and I'm pretty sure less than 10% of people are using BTC. 
Yet you claim: "i can guarantee that btc returns in the next 4 years will be less than they were in the past 4 years."
Do you even understand how stupid that sounds? Unfortunately for you, the price of BTC isn't limited by the depth of your imagination. Literally textbook Dunning–Kruger effect right there.
"any stock, property, or cryptocurrency technically has unlimited upside, with a maximum downside of 100% of the initial investment. that is a fact. lol"
ANY stock or property? Come on, we're dealing with reality here. "Technically" you could win the lottery every week.
Also, claiming to not recognize Bitcoin as having the greatest ROI potential while citing nothing other than shitcoins as potentially superior is laughable. You really don't even see it, do you...
"significantly better tech"
It really should be apparent to anyone paying attention that people want Bitcoin because it's Bitcoin.  It was the first. This first mover advantage does and will persist, it established the largest support both from users and from developers. Being able to boast the largest user and developer base ensures a strong network effect, this causes more users and developers to gravitate towards it.
For a shitcoin to compete with Bitcoin, it would need to offer something revolutionary, which can't be implemented using Bitcoin. Shitcoins are nothing more than a sketch pad for new ideas. Don't forget Bitcoin can incorporate whatever it likes as long as it reaches consensus. There's also a little thing called drivechains. It's a well-accepted phenomenon that the longer something stays in the lead, the longer it is likely to lead.
You just don't make any sense.
On reflection, it's somewhat unclear if you're merely stupid or just trolling.
If you still want to claim you: "can guarantee that btc returns in the next 4 years will be less than they were in the past 4 years." you should head over to Mcafee's twitter and take him up on his bet that BTC will be trading at $500000 within 3 years.

Full nodes validate transactions on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin has this longest-chain rule where the chain with the most work in it is the one that everybody follows, except this chain also has to follow all of the rules that the network has. The full nodes are the ones that check that the chain follows the rules, and if a chain doesn’t follow the rules, it doesn’t matter how much hashrate is behind it, that chain is ignored.

It's only available on a fairly recent firmware update.
In any case it's an option that you have to enable via the security setting option on the nano itself.
I strongly advise you refer to the Ledger website and fully understand the instructions before you attempt this.
As you have two nano's it shouldn't be a problem though. As you can make the new passphrase seed on one, check it, double check it.
Then when you're happy with the way it works change over the other one too. Thats what I did.
You don't even need to worry about forgetting the attached pin too much as you can still enter the passphrase manually by selecting the "set temporary passphrase" option.
Temporary just means the passphrase isn't stored on your ledger.
It sounds more complicated than it is.
If you really get stuck just message me or email the ledger support address. 
Edit: Just realised you're not OP, so maybe you don't have two nano's... If that's the case be double careful.
Anyway, Like I said, if you get stuck just ask.

You don't really seem to understand even the fundamentals of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin developers can't create coins out of thin air/change the supply and creation.  It's actually very difficult to make changes to Bitcoin, and it's like that for a reason. For a change like that to take place there would have to be a consensus between pretty much all users.
Let alone asserting that, at any point another crypto not could but *will* come along and everyone will jump to that one.

It's not random though is it you fucking shill. It can only hurt 2x nodes (Which is why you care).
GTFO shill.

In Zagreb quite a lot. Mind naming the  restaurant/bar?  PM is fine.

Dat international bank transfer fee though...
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:36:06
Works out about 10% if you use broker. If not you have to make an international bank transfer which costs about £25, that's before you even pay Coinfloors exchange fees.

Wall Street is coming.
These life-changing sums of money you keep talking about is a mere drop in the ocean for hedge funds

What a bunch of absolute pussies "Please don't do it". 
They mean, don't dare to do what I wasn't man enough to do.
Due to growth I'm about 2/3 in BTC. 
No regrets, in fact I'll buy more.
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:42:05
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:32:30
Please if you're still doing it? I think I'd actually cry if I received 1 bitcoin. Not ashamed to admit it.

You can always extract your private key from Ledger if you really want to.

Nah, go fuck yourself, you virtue signaling little prick.

Only B was already holding members of A's family hostage. Also  C (Russia) also invaded  B (Poland) at the same time, yet war was not declared on them... Britain was never B. Even if it was, it would have been A and C attack B together, After having kicked the shit out of B, C somehow convinces B it was all A's fault, then B ignores the sound beating from C to focus on its real agenda (Opposition of Nazism).

Because the others are all priced in BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-10 23:38:01
I bet 1400 would seem 'reasonable' now right. Thing is, it seemed extreme when it first hit it.  The best time to buy BTC was in 2009, the second best time is now...
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:14:03
People who opposed Nazism DID cause World War 2...

I think Westerners don't really get it in the sense that Westerners act more like adults than little kids.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:53:40
I think you'll find Russia also invaded Poland at the same time, actually taking more of it than Germany did... So is that REALLY the reason...
@_date: 2017-06-23 23:15:34
I don't think it's correct to say everyone missed the invention of National Socialism.

A little bird told me Coinbase accidentally added hundreds of ETH to some peoples accounts... Apparently some people even managed to withdraw it before they fixed the error. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:44:13
If there would only ever be 21000000 ETH that might actually mean something. Infinite appearing matchsticks will eventually attain a greater value than all the gold on earth.

Ledger or Trezor.  Thats all there is to say about it.

If bitcoin ever falls apart its effectively all over for crypto for a long time.
