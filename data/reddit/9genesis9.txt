did you just assume BTC gender?

Yeah, just because you are bitcoin supporter doesn’t mean you must hate everything else. It also fun to join altcoin hype.

40% loss in 40 years is a long time, compared to fiat or crypto. Even if you are bitcoin holder, gold is also good alternative. Diversify on other things, not just in cryptocurrency

No, of course not. I mean, for survey only. 
Just received more than 5 responses, thanks everyone!

Me to others: never invest more than you can afford to lose.
Also me to myself(whisper): go all f*cking in.

Its nothing compared to 1000 btc wall at $17250 on the other day. Pretty sure we will get 19k in few hours.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:30:19
Cool we have few days left in 2017
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:30:33

could not agree more, there is no black and white. both have benefits and limitations. Its either both exist as complementary or one exist that overcome its limitations.

They are experienced and major player. Of course they have better crystal ball than us.

If you’re western. As asian, we are 10k since yesterday or the day before for some exchanges 
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:17:46
i was so ready to cut loss @ $1000, but it kept rising. it was my lucky day.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:49:41
Only 2 possibilities, my analysis this year quite accurate so far. its either up or down from current price. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:54:05
Many people put order between 9900 to 9999. Thats why we are not 10k yet
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:09:05
Asian numba wan!
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:34:14
Thats what i thought, not just this sub, other like ethereum is also similar (hodl, moon, etc).
I like the idea of bitcoin and many other crypto, however, i dont know whethere it will be realized or not. So, money and profits are still my priority.

Hey dad! Its me your son.

TA is more than you think, most people can't use nor understand it thats why they call it BS. 
It includes human psychology and bots are programmed based on moving average. TA + news helps daily trader, especially for ping pong. Since bitcoin daily volume mostly comes from bot.
Do you really think hedge funds make a lot of money in bitcoin? lol
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:44:04
Whats the plan with the remaining 200,000 BTC?
Edit: I forgot its 160k BTC now
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:07:00
True, but reading chart do help for trader. Whales are not going to put their money if things like EMA hasn’t cross yet
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:34:49
Ah you dont get it, back on your principle pal. Few hundred bucks prince increase/decrease (e.g. 7100 to 6800). Of course it takes hundred thousands or millions to pump/dump it.
Really $30b? How stupid your hedge funds risk $30b in barely $10b volume market lol (plus fake volume from USDT)
Everyone will gladly cashing out from your hedge fund pump. 
Don’t worry, i got plenty from my trading, still working on my bot tho.
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:48:55
Do you know those who use TA are using moving average as well? 
Seems like you spend too much on basic principles.
In this bear market of course no trader trading large amount of money, anyone can manipulate.
Only few hedge funds makes money, just like trader. 
As for now no hedge funds can manipulate to beat mt.gox dump if happens. Not to mention another network attack on bitcoin. Miner manipulation are stronger than just few hundred bucks pump and dump to win a bet.
From your statements, i can see you are a failed trader thats why you are so salty.
