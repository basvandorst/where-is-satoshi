Bitcoin is not the lottery, like anything else people need to educate themselves about what they are investing in. The [white paper]( is the best place to start, next step is to research inflation and how the federal reserve works, then research deflationary things and figure out how Bitcoin fits into it all...

I would take a look into Monero; BTC -&gt; shapeshift.io -&gt; XMR, then XMR -&gt; xmr.to -&gt; BTC, I haven't looked too hard at it but it seems like an interesting thing, I'd be interested in the commissions taken off the top.

I would like to hear the beginning of what he was saying to get context.

So you're saying he watched the trailer and said that? Ha ha! Not convinced! ;-)
I'm interested in what he was talking about? DACs, exchange,... What his take actually is that he dismisses the fact he can buy a "felafel".
I guess I'll have to wait for it to come out and sling some BTC their way.

It's not keeping up per the original design, code was added to drop aged (72hrs) transactions that aren't moving, so the backlog disapears and people move on.

I'm with you, normal routes like [xetrade]( are cheaper at the moment.

Like it or not, [inflation steals the value of your property]( over time, you are relying on the price to increase to match inflation, not to mention the always present taxes you're liable for once you buy it....

pfft indeed.

It's not "free money", you are overpaying for the product and getting a small % of the money back, you are playing a game with the credit card company and loosing. 
The credit card company charges a percentage of the purchase price to cover the transaction, this causes the retailer to bump up the price to cover the cost of the credit transaction. You might remember gas stations with a cheaper price for payment in cash or, if you're old enough, buying big box items and asking for a cash discount in the 90's.
The credit card companies colluded to force retailers to hide this fee from consumers, they recently lost this battle and, depending on where you live, you may soon see the cash/credit prices coming back.
Rest assured, this is not "free money", you are loosing the game you are playing, do the math.
