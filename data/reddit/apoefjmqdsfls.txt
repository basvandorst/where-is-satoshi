And here we learn true humanity. I lost coins on finex, you can give them back on following address. Thanks.
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:14:01
Yes, your numbers and math are wrong. First of all, the 61% is not confirmed, it was just speculation. Secondly, total loss is 36% of all funds.

I verified the signature and checked the hashes... I wasn't saying that I had a good copy because I torrented, I was just mentioning it that I didn't download it from bitcoin.org.
@_date: 2016-08-08 19:05:02
It doesn't matter what got stolen. Bitfinex had x money in custody, some got stolen, now they only have 0.64x of the money. Normally this would be a bankruptcy case, but I gladly take the 64% now, instead of 20% after 5 years.
However I can't imagine nobody will force them into bankruptcy so I think the second option will become reality... Hopefully they do enable withdrawals so that I can get my cut out.
The only reasons I can see to force them into bankrupcy is 1) revenge 2) idiocy and 3) a competitor seeing a nice opportunity to take them down.
The motive for reason 3 is obvious. I can also understand reason 1 because it does sting a bit that they have 36% of my funds and still in business like nothing happened, but I rather spend my time and money on other things. 
Reason 2 is for people who think they will get a better deal if they force them into bankruptcy. I think the chance is close to zero for a better deal when you go the legal route + you will also see none of your funds for at least a couple of years.

I don't think a lot of people really store coins on finex. Speculation is the main usage of bitcoin and finex was the most popular exchange for traders from the west. You need money on the exchange in order to trade.

Bankruptcy trustee of mtgox did exactly the same...

So you think it's the right number?
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:58:41
In a bankruptcy case, the funds will be split over all users. It doesn't matter whose coins are stolen.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:27:07
As it should be and as any bankruptcy trustee would decide as well (this is also how it went with mtgox). Bitfinex took custody of user coins, they can't pay everybody back atm so they give all users an equal haircut. This has nothing to do with bitcoin.
I was planning to talk to my laywer, but I don't see the point anymore since it would be the same outcome, except a lot of extra legal fees and a lot of extra time.
@_date: 2016-08-24 22:15:26
Seems like a database with edit history would solve your problems way more efficient than a 'private blockchain'.

If bitfinex files for bankruptcy, then yes, that's normally how it works.

36% still sucks, but giving everybody an equal haircut is the fairest way to solve this.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:18:32
From the bankruptcy case: 


That's around $450M. And they valued all the bitcoins at  50058 JPY (now around $500) but bitcoin was around $600 when mtgox went down.
The funds they still have: 202k BTC + 1,064,664,553 JPY, this is around $111M
So at current rates, they lost around $339M.

I feel like the btc-e story didn't really get a lot of attention, but all people who held coins at btc-e just lost them?? Without any prove that there was any wrongdoing? I actually used btc-e as my main exchange in 2013 when Mtgox started to act funny and have nothing to do with drugs, or money laundering or anything illegal. I'm sure the majority of their users were just normal crypto people. Luckily I didn't lost anything here, but a country like the USA just taking the coins and no communication what so ever after it? Is there even a process?

It has to do with relative hash rate, if bcash has 7.8% of bitcoin's block reward, you would expect it to have 7.8% of bitcoin's hash rate, but bitcoin also has transaction fees, which makes the hash rate of bcash go lower than 7.8%.

Mtgox supposedly lost 650k bitcoin, it's still under investigation. Bitstamp got hacked recently, they lost around 19k btc, but that's kind of a non-event since they take the loss completely themselves, so it's not really a lowpoint in the history of bitcoin, a lot of other events would qualify for that.
@_date: 2015-12-22 20:51:41


Total amount of the bankruptcy claims filed: JPY 2,663,398,225,570 (of which the amount of the claims filed by the three largest creditors amounted to JPY 2,533,517,211,285)
So around 22 billion dollars are claimed... don't put too much value in this since you could claim any amount you wanted.

I tried it once and the package arrived. It's just that you have to pay around a 10% markup. It makes sense of course, they are buying it for you and they need to make some money too. It would be more of a red flag if they didn't ask any fees, but a 10% markup doesn't really make the service attractive.

To be brutal honest, just throwing money at dozens of projects without any checks and balances is a very poor way to give away a fortune.

They can't freeze it, even more, if you manage your bitcoins good, they can't even know which addresses you own. They can of course put you in jail or take away your stuff/house. They could sort of reclaim that power when they start pushing for projects like coinvalidation so that companies can only accept bitcoins from trusted addresses. Or they can infiltrate in the big mining pools and demanding that they won't mine certain transactions.

Bcash (i.e. Roger Ver's version of bitcoin) has no claim at all to the name bitcoin. It's a minority hard fork of the real bitcoin. Bitcoin follows the initial vision of a truely decentralized network which everybody can join without the need for any permission, nor to send the coins, nor to hold, nor to check the rules of the network. Bcash breaks away from this by pushing nodes away from normal consumers into databases only a select few can own.
@_date: 2014-12-10 00:35:03
I expect that they would have shared the results if the numbers were better. That said, last black friday was during a giant bull run, everybody had massive profits, so it's not that weird that it's a bit less this time.
And I think they also lost market share to coinbase, it would be interesting if they release some numbers.

Bitcoin is all about freeing yourself from any dependencies, when you use third parties, you lost your independence. That's why real bitcoiners don't like these services, but it's a free market, people can use whatever they want.

When you send real bitcoins to the bcash address, do you see them showing up in the app (without first enabling the 'bitcoin core' option in 'advanced features')? I'm guessing not, so it's an understandable reaction that these people think their coins are gone. Also, when you install the app it says that it is making a bitcoin wallet, and then it shows a bcash address which makes it all very confusing.

In highly competitive markets, there's a lot of incentive to change habits, but not every market is so competitive. I'm actually not really against these payment processors because otherwise almost nobody would start to accept bitcoins. I was more being off-topic and referring to the average joe using services like blockchain.info.
(but you could debate that using those services isn't really accepting bitcoins, but it's more like using bitcoins as a payment service, buy you have to start somewhere I guess)
EDIT: but it would be nice if there was some free software available that merchants could use if they don't wanna rely on these services, the software could be connected to for example the bitstamp api and sell the bitcoins immediately if that's what the merchant wants.

It actually is really easy to accept bitcoin as a merchant, just generate a new bitcoin address everytime someone wants to make a payment or soon you can use stealth addresses. You can link this to an api of an exchange so that everything gets sold immediately for bitcoin if you only want fiat. Why do merchants not do this? Well they probably aren't that familiar with bitcoin and when you use a third party, you can of course shift the responsibility to them. Also, third parties lock you at a certain price during the purchase of the customer, which is hard to do on your own.

The main purpose of mining is actually, well mining. The nodes that send the transactions to the miners already verify if the transaction is valid, so in normal cases, miners don't really have to verify because they are already verified, they just have to do the POW. People normally have to run software that checks if their rules are fulfilled, if a miner sends a block that violates one of your rules, your software will not add that block to the blockchain. So if users agree on certain rules, then the miners have to comply, otherwise they're mining for nobody.

You have to be a bit realistic, yes there will be court fees etc, but it won't be 60%, I think 20% is a lot more reasonable and still on the high side. And if they will liquidate it, it will be paid in JPY and the price will just depend on what they will get for it.. Plus you also have to take in account that probably a lot of creditors won't claim their bitcoins back, so their share will be redivided.
@_date: 2014-11-29 22:17:54
No, your software will only accept blocks that follow your rules, if bitcoin users agree on certain rules, but miners use ones that violate the rules used by most users, then they are mining for practically nobody, because almost nobody will use their blocks.
Miners can add rules that don't violate the rules used by most people though, and this might give them some dangerous power, but miners can for example never change the total amount of coins without users agreeing on it.

As I said before, miners can currently do bad things, but they still have to follow the rules of the users otherwise it won't have any effect. At the moment they can for example mine empty blocks so that no transactions go through, or first raise the difficulty and then suddenly disconnect all their miners so that the difficulty is so high that with the network that's still remaining, it would take for example a week to mine a block. Or just the traditional 51% attack. These actions however are extremely expensive, so the malicious actor would need a lot of funding and benefit from the downfall of bitcoin.

I think you're confused. Miners can fork the main chain to do a double spent and if they have enough mining power, the fork can become the main chain, but that's all within the set of user-defined rules. If miners suddenly gonna reward themselves with a 50btc coinbase transactions, that won't work unless the users agree with it. Even if they have more than 50% of mining power.
@_date: 2014-07-04 16:23:06
Look at the massive spikes in [bitcoin days destroyed]( on 21 December and 6 February, I'm pretty sure that's when the theft occured. On 7 February mtgox halted bitcoin withdrawals, do you need more coincidence?
Also, on 10 February there was a massive dump on btc-e and bitfinex to around $100, pretty suspicious and I think a good starting lead for investigators.

Because 20 MB blocks are again a big step away from decentralization. In an ideal world, every wallet should check whether the blocks they add to the chain follow their agreed rules, otherwise this power will be given to the few persons who mine and set up nodes, but the real users won't have any power over the consensus, with 20 MB blocks this becomes more and more impossible.

Don't wanna be disrespectful, but I think the documentary was pretty long-threaded, sometimes even boring. And I can relate to almost all the events that happened in the documentary, so for a complete outsider, it probably would even be less interesting. 
This documentary is completely from the pov of bitcoiners, which was most likely also the intention, but it makes it really biased, maybe even to the annoyance of the outsider, whom, in general, is a bitcoin critic.
@_date: 2014-11-29 21:28:54
lol miners can't rewrite the protocol, they can choose to not mine some transactions, but the transactions they mine still have to follow the rules of the protocol otherwise nobody will accept their blocks. So almost everything he derives from this, is just false.

I understand that, but if he has to buy a whole mining operation to collect those extra fees, he ain't gonna make any profit.

The lightning network is a way to take a lot of load away from the bitcoin network. I'm not saying that we should keep the 1 MB limit, neither is btw, I'm just saying that it should feasible for everybody to run a node, so when in the future it becomes trivial for everybody in the world to have bitcoin core on his laptop with 20 MB blocks, then I won't have any problems with that.

The users have a lot more power than they actually think. It's absolutely not true that miners control the network.

Theoretically, segwit actually only needs &gt;50% of hashing power, since from that point, segwit miners can just ignore all blocks that don't signal segwit, so you can actually reach 100% signaling with just over 50% of hashing power.

It's basically a premine scam. They raised 31k bitcoin by selling premined coins. The product itself is a security nightmare. It's almost impossible to sync a node without the --fast parameter, which basically skips all validation.
Bitcoin made the right decision to make the base protocol as simple as possible, so that more advanced transactions can be build on top of it. With ethereum, the base protocol can run turing complete scripts, which is just screaming for major bugs.

Not everybody has to run a node. I would argue that it is even better when people who don't have a real opinion about the network rules, don't run a node because they will just follow the path with least resistance, but people who do care should be able to do it without much overhead.

They do secure the network, but they are subordinate to the rules the users accept. If some miners decide to change the rules, doesn't matter how much hashing power they have, if the users don't follow, they will just be mining for nobody, because nobody will accept their blocks.

It's weird that a lot of people don't get this, but a miner is there to make money. The market price of the coin will determine where all the hash rate will go to. Hash rate follows the price, not the other way around.

Every transaction under 546 satoshi is a non-standard transaction, so that's another 0.00819 btc. You also made a typo, the fee is 0.00001 btc and not 0.0001btc.
Also, normally, the first 50kB are getting filled according to priority, and these low value transaction will have very low priority so old coins and big transactions won't really be affected by this denial of service attack.
the priority rule
     priority = sum(input_value_in_base_units * input_age)/size_in_bytes
The 546 is the min when you have one input and one output (when your transaction is 182 bytes), if your transaction is 500 bytes, the minimum output should be 1500 satoshi if I understand correctly, otherwise it would be considered dust.

You should just resend the tx, don't use this service, it's a rip-off. The bitcoin core client currently suggests a fee of 0.0557 BTC (around $62) to get it confirmed within 4 hours. Transactions with a lot of inputs should be a lot cheaper once segwit is activated.

Assuming they have that many bitcoin, assuming core supporters don't have more bitcoins.


So you're stating here that miners will follow the money, it's the same I was saying.


The main reason why there are miners, is because they are making money. It doesn't make a lot of sense to mine bitcoins, when mining will cost you more than you pay for it on an exchange. The amount of money a miner is willing to spend on mining is entirely dependent on the price of the reward, so no, hash rate does not drive up the price. Even if some miners are just doing it to buy bitcoins in a more anonymous way or whatever, the only effect they can have on the market is to not sell the reward, but the amount of money they spend on the mining has no effect on the exchange rate.


Looks like the two biggest exchanges, poloniex and bitfinex, already stated on their website that they will list the core implemenation as 'BTC' and the other one as 'BTU'. Coinbase is far from the biggest exchange  and it will be really confusing when the major exchanges list the core implementation as BTC and and coinbase will list the unlimited implementation as BTC. I doubt Coinbase will risk this major confusion (and possible legal risk).
The only thing that the mining cartel has going for them is the slow difficulty retargeting, we'll see how that plays out.
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:45:39

Current threshold is 95%, it's possible to reach it with just over 50% of hashing power, but then the segwit miners need to collaborate in a 51% attack which is unlikely. With UASF, we can safely enable segwit with just over 50% of hashing power. We can even enable it with less than 50% of hashing power, but then there is a risk that the chain will split.
@_date: 2015-05-31 23:20:04
Well I'm willing to believe that these businesses aren't against decentralization, but they also have no motive to favor it, I guess most of them are indifferent about the matter, they just want bitcoin to work. This lack of emphasis on the core values of bitcoin, like decentralization and independence, will just turn bitcoin into paypal2.0. If that's what the current community wants, well ok, but I will move forward and liquidate my bitcoin assets if it ever comes to that.
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:25:16
An 'anyone-can-spend' output script is non-standard, so by default, a non-segwit miner won't include it in a block, but he will accept mined blocks that contain non-standard scripts that valuate to 'true'. 
It's possible the chain will split, but that requires two things: (1) A malicious miner mining an invalid segwit tx and (2) non-segwit miners are the majority.
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:18:16

If you control your own private keys, you have to do nothing. You will automatically have coins on both chains.
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:40:15
Besides BU being an untested (and imo destructive) change to the consensus software, it will also result in a chain split. With UASF for segwit, there's a big chance the chain won't split. I agree, it's not perfect, but I think it's better than an eternal stalemate.
@_date: 2017-03-04 01:52:43
Miners don't accept non-standard tx's. A segwit tx is a non-standard tx for a non-segwit miner so he won't put it in a block.
Nodes will also not relay them, since for a non-segwit node, the tx is non-standard and for a segwit node, the tx is invalid.
It is possible of course that a malicious miner includes an invalid segwit tx in its block. Non-segwit nodes will allow the tx, segwit nodes won't, so the chain will split when the majority of the miners is not running segwit, when the majority is running segwit, non-segwit miners will just follow the segwit chain since it will be longer.
It's not the best outcome, but it is still better than a BU hard fork.

You have a misunderstanding about bitcoin. Hashing a chain doesn't give it any value. Hash rate will follow the price of the coins that can be mined not the other way around. A miner can't force a user to follow a certain chain by guessing some hashes. The miner follows the user because the user adds value to the chain so that the hashes of the miner have some value.
@_date: 2016-03-17 01:16:35

Don't invest your time in scamcoins. You need more than 50% of mining hash power to double spend the coins, or if you have zero confirmations, and you opt-in for rbf, you can try that.

Asking which one is the fork is just a technical question. S2X is changing the consensus rules in a way that they are not compatible with their previous rules, which means that they are hard forking the chain. 
As stated numerous times, the hash rate promises are worthless because they will just switch over according to profitability, like is happening with Bcash. If you read the statement, it even says that hash rate is not important 'The Bitcoin Core implementation will continue to trade as BTC (or XBT) and all exchanges will process deposits and withdrawals in BTC even if the BTU chain has more hashing power'.

While an increase to 2MB is already a dangerous move when the entire community agrees to it (which is everything but true) because with segwit enabled this will lead to blocks around the size of 4MB, with an absolute maximum of 8MB. A recent Cornell study showed that blocks bigger than 4MB will result in the loss of a significant amount of nodes in the network. Note that the study didn't show 4MB blocks are safe, it just showed that 4MB is an upper bound, meaning that there might be other reasons why even smaller blocks might be unsafe.
The big problem is that this is a hard fork out of political reasons. An increase to 2MB won't solve anything! Blocks will be full again after a few months and we will have the exact same problems again!! So whether it is a hard fork to 2MB or 1.05MB or 1.000001 MB, none of that makes sense. It splits the community and will result in a loss of trust in the system for the general public. So you are asking the right question, is this hard fork worth the chain split? There are no winners in this split, only losers.
Bitcoin is all about security and decentralization, when the community throws these out of the window to boost somebody's ego or for some short term profits, it becomes clear that a decentralized currency is a utopia that cannot stand the test of time.

Can you give me any source that Core wants to stay on 1MB forever? You can't, because they never said that. Look up the Core scaling road map. They are even suggesting block size increases in the future. 
The B2X hard fork is reckless and has no majority support. Hard forks might happen in the future, when they have unanimous agreement, coded by competent devs and will serve more useful upgrades  ( than a silly 1MB increase to boost some egos. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:18:14
Oh really? It looks to me like miners are dropping BTC like a stone whenever BCH is more profitable to mine, and same goes the other way. It's very expensive to go against the short-term incentive of the mining reward and it doesn't look like that's happening at all.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:17:56
We can only have a clean hard fork when there is nearly unanimous consensus (and no mining hash rate doesn't represent that, see my comment [here]( S2X is trying to change the consensus rules here. They clearly don't have near unanimous agreement so we default back to no change.

That would be true if hashrate stayed around the same level which is not the case. With constantly increasing hashrate, you're far better off in a pool because you can earn bitcoins in respect to your current share of hashrate (which is constantly declining if you don't keep buying equipment).

20 exchanges signed this document  stating that they won't list a contentious hard fork without replay protection.
S2X doesn't want to implement replay protection, do you think these exchanges, who didn't sign the NYA, will not follow through on their words?
@_date: 2017-08-20 03:04:54
The S2X hard fork is not intending to implement replay protection. This means that when you send a tx on the bitcoin chain, and the outputs also exist on the S2X chain (which will be the case for all outputs in the beginning), the tx will be 'replayed' on the S2X chain, meaning you will also spend your S2X tokens.
This leads to a big mess where people are sending coins without their knowledge on the other chain. This is how Coinbase and btc-e lost a lot of their ETC during the DAO hard fork.
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:34:07
You're looking at the wrong numbers, you can see here that 20% of hash power is hashing on the Bcash chain 
You're making a lot of assumption without any backing. Only 4 out of the 20 exchanges also signed the NYA. They NYA is very short and vague statement, left open for a lot of interpretation. The signees might have thought the chain had replay protection, or expected it to be uncontroversial. As reality sips in, it's a very controversial hard fork which will make it very hard for them to follow through with it.
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:47:51
There is no progress yet because we had to wait an entire year for segwit activation. Now that segwit will get activated in two weeks, capacity will increase with segwit tx adoption and people will start working on implementing LN. If segwit was activated a year ago, we would probably already be using LN.
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:03:39
I don't think you're understanding it. You can still send 0 fee tx's just fine. What is being removed is the built-in reserved place for possible zero fee transactions (which all miners stopped using).

SPV wallets might switch between chains when the hash rate distribution is 50-50. Users WILL lose money when they send coins on the other chain without their knowledge because of tx replay. There might be confusion with ticker names. In short it will be a shit show and for what goal?? What do we win with this silly 1MB upgrade?

* I'm accusing them of breaking the intent of the NYA. The intent was to unite together to prevent a chain split. The chain already split making the NYA void.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:16:22

We are right now witnessing a beautiful example for why mining intention has very little meaning. As of writing, 40% of mining hash power is on the BCH chain! You know why? Because currently it's more profitable to mine on that chain. They have a broken retarget algo that allows them to mine at a very low difficulty. Right now they are mining a block every two minutes! Miners just follow profitability and they will move to whatever chain that will make them the most money.

It's not a straw man because you're arguing that when 92% of the miners are signaling for NYA means that there is consensus about it. I'm telling you that a few Chinese people control the entire bitcoin mining industry, so that's not representative in any way for the entire bitcoin community.
And no, I don't see hash rate as a vote. Hash rate will always converge to the point where all coins with the same hashing algo are equally profitable. So right now 92% might be signaling for B2X, but when the two coins hit the market and both have equal value for example, the hash rate will just converge to 50%-50%, so these early hash rate promises have no value, the market price will decide the hash rate.
50% of the mining power was also voting for BU, now that they have bcash, most are still mining normal bitcoin because the bcash tokens have not enough value.

B2X is a well funded attack on bitcoin. Do you think people should stay silent about it? It's a corporate take-over, with devs paid by some bitcoin companies to further their agenda. The Core team is an open collaboration of mainly volunteers. B2X, funded by a few companies, is trying to change this by putting their own team in charge. Should we just ignore this? The main dev even owns a blockchain analysis company called 'Skry'. That company basically exists to help LE track coins. Do you want a guy like this as lead dev of bitcoin? Passionate users will actively resist these hostile take-overs so expect a lot more noise about B2X.

So important for them that 50% of hashing power switched to BCH in a matter of hours because it was more profitable to mine? The only thing btc miners are loyal to is the hashing algo because their asics can only do one.
You're doing a wrong comparison BTW. Miners buy their coins by buying hardware and electricity. A normal hodler buys his coins directly on the market. A miner doesn't lose more than a hodler, even less since mining can still be profitable so they basically get a discount on their purchase price.

@_date: 2017-08-20 21:38:27
No, that is not the fundamental design of bitcoin. Miners cannot enforce hard forks, they cannot force users to follow a certain chain. The only power that miners have is picking what transactions to mine, which might be taken from them as well when more anonymity layers are added to bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a consensus system, it's not possible to give each user plugins to customize the protocol to their liking, because those plugins will (most likely) break consensus and your client will just fork away from the main network.

A lot of people seem to prefer CPU/GPU mining because they argue it's more decentralized, but as you can see these ASICs also have their advantages. A sudden big drop in hashrate would be very inconvenient for bitcoin because of the slow mining difficulty retarget.

Why aren't people who are just interested in lower fees using a coin like Dogecoin? Their current median fee per tx is 0.1 cent! Yes that's cent, not dollar. 
People pushing this high fee narrative are either ignorant about the workings of bitcoin or intentional malicous. They are not interested in just low fees. They are interested in using bitcoin with low fees. They don't see, or want to see, why people are paying these fees for using bitcoin and that changing certain variables to lower these fees might change the whole reason why people were paying these fees in the first place.
You are describing a made-up conflict between people who want to pay low fees and between people who want to pay high fees. The real conflict is between people who can look past these short-term deficits and between people who can't. 
The NYA (which I never agreed to BTW and had no community involvement) tried to find a common ground between the two groups. It makes a lot of sense from a pure business POV. I'm arguing in my OP that even if you agreed with the NYA, the agreement is completely void because it won't achieve the desired goal and will only make things worse.

I think your fall is going to be painful. Try syncing a node from 2 years ago and tell me again how the software hasn't improved. The core team is the ONLY dev team working on the protocol that's coming with innovation. The other ones are copy and pasting Core's hard work, changing a few variables and trying to get credit for it. 
If you install the ABC client of the big block team on ubuntu (which has a closed dev team that you cannot join), the software is still called 'Bitcoin Core', that's how professional they are.

In the 0.13 release of bitcoin core, there was no 'within 1 block' fee estimation, the quickest was 'within 2 blocks'. Since 0.13.1 there suddenly is a fee estimation for 'within 1 block' and it's very high. At the moment of writing, it's 0.011 BTC/kB to get in the next block and 0.00062 BTC/kB to get confirmed within 2 blocks according to the Core client. Maybe some wallets use this code and that's the reason for the sudden high fees?

I always use the 'confirmed within 6 blocks' fee estimation from the bitcoin core client and it's almost always confirmed in the next block.

Bitcoin needs a healthy fee market or the chain will become very unreliable once the block reward gets too small, and a good fee market also helps the miners during a block reward halving, to smoothen the shock. Especially in times like now when most miners are operating at break even.
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:17:01
Yes, it just takes 6 mining pools cooperate.

The ceo was a real buttcoiner. [1]( [2]( [3](
and this for example


A currency offering close to total anonymity is obviously the currency of choice for ransoms of all kinds. This is just one of the reasons for Bitcoin should never become a monetary standard.


"There were over 300,000 known incidents in the last quarter. Deprived of the use of their computer and important files and with little recourse to the law, victims often feel forced to pay the attackers the hundreds of dollars that they demand to unlock the data.”
"The virtual currency is anonymous, at least until it is exchanged for conventional money.” — In case the merchant is an outlaw, Bitcoin will most likely stay anonymous,
"But Bitcoin is gaining legitimacy, with Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, writing last month that virtual currencies hold “long term promise” for innovation in finance and Silicon Valley companies aspiring to use it as the basis of a low-cost alternative financial system.”
A different, fully traceable, Bitcoin system: yes. Bitcoin as it is now: total nonsense.

@_date: 2015-08-11 16:37:57
That doesn't mean they support xt though, the chinese miners already said that they are OK with 8MB, but won't change to xt for it. And if you look at the nodes, it's quite obvious xt supporters are just a vocal minority. Currently, 160 of 6025 nodes are running xt.

No probably not, but it still works right now so that's a great opportunity for greeks that want to have some money out of their bank account.


Not sure who's selling there, some people presumably still prefer money on their bank account over bitcoin.


Currently there is a 1% markup excluding fees, I don't know what fees apply there.

@_date: 2015-07-07 04:19:31


The goal of bitcoin is to be able to send money in digital form to any person without any intermediary, and to be able to control that money without having to rely on an intermediary.
It is promoted as a low cost payment system, but that's not the main goal. I remember mostly bitpay started to push the zero fee argument, I always found it to be a bit dishonest, because the future of the fee market has always been a bit unclear.

Seems to imply it's normal to use this optimization.


That's odd, why not use it? It's just a long-published ASIC optimization.


Oh you even designed the circuit to use it. Seems strange not to use it then.


You even hold the patents!!!


So you're saying it's very positive for your business, but you still aren't using it?


Oh really, that's strange, doesn't look like you're signaling for the fix.


But you're the patent owner, right?? So making ASICBOOST difficult is a loss for you.. but you aren't using it right?


So the developers have to work with you so that you can keep using ASICBOOST. Hypothetically of course, because you aren't using it right?


Not really no, hash rate will increase to the new equilibrium.




You're saying it's not good for bitcoin, but you're also saying that calling the optimisation an attack is bad?

I'm also pro segwit, but it makes a lot of sense to add hash power when the price is going up. On the other hand, there seems to be a very strong positive correlation with segwit signaling and price so adding more non-segwit hash power is an odd move in that perspective.

Hey, I just saw you did an AMA around a month ago on r/btc. I don't know who tricked you into posting it on r/btc instead of r/bitcoin, but I hope you realize r/btc is not a bitcoin sub, but a subreddit of a bitcoin clone called Bcash or BCH. They are quite hostile towards bitcoin so you should take their opinions with a grain of salt.
I also want to inform you about Bitpay's recent decision to force BIP70 for every bitcoin payment on their checkout. Instead of just showing a bitcoin address, they now show a BIP70 QR code which only very few bitcoin wallets support, besides their own corporate wallet of course. I'm sure you're seeing a higher drop rate once the customer sees the Bitpay checkout page because the customer has no wallet that supports BIP70. 
Besides the BIP70 controversy, Bitpay is also being funded by Bitmain, the largest bitcoin ASIC producer in the world and biggest financial backer of Bcash or BCH. Bcash was created by them because they had a patented efficiency advantage in bitcoin mining that wouldn't work anymore after the segwit update. So the only reason Bitpay is supporting bcash now is because they are being funded by Bitmain.
I would like to point you into the direction of an open-source alternative of Bitpay which Cheapair just started using  It's called btcpayserver and you can find the code here  It's even possible to accept lightning payments with it.
I'm already using Destinia since you started supporting bitcoin around 2014 iirc. I'm probably one of your first bitcoin customers and the first time I booked a hotel through your site with bitcoin it went horribly wrong and had to call 5 - 6 times with your Spanish support team who didn't know anything about bitcoin and they told me they didn't know the bitcoin credit card : ). I wasn't mad at all because I was glad I could pay my hotels with bitcoin through a European agency and in the end it was all sorted out. I just hope Bitpay and the bcashers aren't dragging you into the bitcoin scaling wars and trying to push you into the cesspool that is the altcoin world.

Miners can choose which transactions to mine, that's correct, but no, they don't decide the consensus rules. You're flipping cause and effect. The coin with most value will get the most hash rate, so yes, the coin with most hash rate is the coin with most value, but it has the most hash rate because it hash the biggest value, not the other way around. Hash rate itself doesn't give value to a coin.

the users of the system. It is due to this level of encryption that a virtual currency such as Bitcoin is in
principle much more secure than using cash, credit and debit cards or direct money transfers between
traditional banks. Bitcoin is in fact the first global electronic currency to have even been developed.


of the need for a 'third-party verifier' of transactions. Bitcoin usage would help to 'de-fragment' the
global financial market, which has always been the preferred market model by banks around the
world seeking to (thus far) prevent the emergence of a global electronic currency. This therefore offers
a number of potentially highly-positive impacts stemming from the fact that use of virtual currency
could be cheaper, easier and faster than existing methods of payments. For example, users of Bitcoins
do not need to use bank accounts, with the associated credit and security checks that make their use
complicated in comparison, simply accessing a 'digital wallet' via an internet connection.
Transaction costs of making payments for goods and services should fall dramatically were virtual
currencies to be more widely used. This would help smaller business and 'start-ups' as this type of
running cost can disproportionately impact upon their operating expenditure capacities. Not only
this, but use of Bitcoins could vastly improve access of buyers with sellers. With an enlarging of
markets for good and services, accompanied by faster personal and business transactions across
international borders, the impacts for the EU's and the global economy are potentially massive.
Furthermore, if virtual currencies were to be embraced by financial institutions this could usher in a
new era of highly secure, cheaper, and easier to access means of payment.

I don't see what your point is, a lot of users doesn't make it hard to take something down. They can probably take the whole Visa network down with a hit on a button.


That's a good one and one of the reasons the required resources for a node should be as low as possible.

@_date: 2016-10-17 00:54:44


Your mistake is thinking that it is out of goodwill. If it's possible to pay a lower fee, people will pay a lower fee, that's why you need a fee market so that people compete with each other to be in the next block, if their fee is not high enough, they will have to wait longer. 
Right now, the fees aren't actually that imported for the system since the block reward is still high (their function right now is mainly spam deterrent) but they will become more and more important to sustain the system so it's important that we create a fee market.
You either make it dependent on fees or you have to add a yearly inflation rate to sustain the system.

40 cents would be enough...And how long will you have to wait for your SEPA tx? Big transactions can take a couple of days with SEPA! If you make a right comparison and allow the btc tx to get confirmed in a few days instead of minutes, your fee would be a few cents or maybe even zero.

Some online wallets like blockchain.info receive funding from Bitmain to not implement it.

No, because traditional tx's are still max 1MB, only with segwit tx's you can have more than 1MB.

Bitcoin has its own scripting language but you can't really make your own scripts since only a few predefined scripts are allowed by the bitcoin network, you can find them [here]( Older versions don't have the segwit scripts marked as allowed scripts so they are non-standard to them.
Transactions that have a non-standard script are not relayed by nodes, but they are accepted in blocks if the script returns 'true'. A non-zero value is true and the scriptpubkey of a segwit tx always pushes the hash at the end so they are always true.
@_date: 2016-10-29 20:07:00


No they won't forward them since it will look like a non-standard tx. They will however not complain when they are included in a block.

Your math is way off. When you have 10% of current hash rate and switch to the bip148 chain with 0% hash rate but same difficulty, you will have 100% of the hash rate on the bip148 chain, so you will mine a block every 100 minutes on average just like on the other chain.

If the price of these bip148 coins exceed the price of the non-bip148 coins, the bip148 chain will get more hash rate than the other one and since bip148 is a soft fork and fully compliant with existing rules, the whole non-bip148 chain will get orphaned and miners will lose all the rewards they got on the non-bip148 chain.

We aren't talking about facts here. A market outcome is only a fact after it happened. Nor am I saying that something will happen, I was merely correcting OP about the false notion that current signaling rate is an indicator of hash rate support. The hash rate support will just depend on the price of the coin.
Reasons why the segwit coin might become more valuable:
* Allows for massive scaling solutions like lightning networks
* Fear of the orphan risk which will result in a loss of all mined coins on the non-bip148 chain
*  There is massive support for segwit according to  and little opposition
* The market is clearly not interested in a BU fork 
* a UASF will show people that miners are overplaying their position and have much less power in reality
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:40:20
The only parameter that will matter is the price of the coin. When the bip148 coins have the most value, they will get the most PoW and the other chain will get orphaned. You can bet against this by selling your bip148 coins. The market will decide.
@_date: 2015-03-08 21:54:24

They need cash, it's easy to convert bitcoins to cash. With Monero, you first have to convert them to bitcoins at an exchange, and then convert the bitcoins to cash which introduces extra breadcrumbs.

A 2MB hard fork is such a short sighted move. You risk a potential fork so that you can kick the can a few months further? If there will be a hard fork, it should contain all kinds of improvements that are in the HF wish list.

@_date: 2017-05-05 17:34:42
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:15:35


Because miners mine the coin that makes them the most profit. Current signaling doesn't account for the main or maybe even only force behind mining, which is profitability.


It is needed to do it efficient.


No, only the non-bip148 can be orphaned since bip148 ignores non-segwit blocks.

Because they allow for massive expansion through lightning networks. Mining hash power follows the price of the coin, so they will have security relative to their price.


Because non-segwit blocks are not valid under bip148, so the bip148 chain will just ignore them while segwit blocks are valid on the non-bip148 chain. So the bip148 chain satisfies all the rules of the non-bip148 chain, but the opposite is not true. Miners follow the chain with the most proof of work, since the bip148 chain is a valid chain under current rules, whenever this chain gets the most pow, miners will automatically follow it, resulting in orphaning the non-bip148 chain.
@_date: 2017-05-17 23:35:12
Eumh, the code for 2MB blocks is already ready for half a year. It's called segwit.

Not really, because they recently announced a partnership between Bitpay and Bitmain. [source](
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:06:09
There is no real correlation between current signaling rates and effective hash rate that will follow the bip148 chain. There is only one parameter that will decide the effective hash rate: the price of the coin.
When the price of the coins on the bip148 chain exceed the price of the non-bip148 chain, then the bip148 chain will get the most hash rate. At this point the non-bip148 chain will get orphaned away since bip148 is a soft fork and fully compliant with existing rules. All coins mined on the non-bip148 will be destroyed, so it's actually risky to follow the non-bip148 chain since at any time in the future, there is a chance that the entire chain will get orphaned.

They aren't there forever, they eventually get dropped out of the mempool like the tx never happened. You can always get these tx's confirmed by spending one of the outputs of the tx with sufficient fee. It's called CPFP (Child pays for parent). 
Block space is indeed a limited resource, and bitcoin can only process 1MB of tx's every 10 minutes. That's why a lot of people are interested in lightning networks. It will will allow for secure transactions off-chain, and they only have to settle from time to time on the bitcoin blockchain.

Your entire comment is correct except the last sentence. I think you're confused about the term 'orphaned'. It's not overtaking the other chain, but abandoning an entire branch of the chain. This cannot happen to the bip148 chain since the non-bip148 blocks are not compliant with bip148 and if they were then this split wouldn't have been possible.

That was a bit awkward.

I think you're overestimating the amount of lost coins. You should only deduct the coins that are certainly lost, like the block reward from the genesis block and bitcoins on this address  this why you can make a real boundary, otherwise it's just speculation.
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:35:31
The network still has to synchronize, otherwise you can send the same coins multiple times. It doesn't really matter whether you use a linked list or a DAG.
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:58:42
Action you can do now: 
* Install the bitcoin abc wallet on a clean VM so that their malware won't be able to compromise your computer. Copy the blocks and chainstate directory from your .bitcoin folder to your .bitcoin folder of the bitcoin abc client so that you don't have to wait for it to sync.
Actions after the hard fork:
* Since bitcoin cash has replay protection, you can just send your proper bitcoins to a new address, your bitcoin cash tokens won't follow. (you can maybe check this on a block explorer, I don't know if they have one.)
* Now that your proper bitcoins are in a safe place, you can import the private keys of the addresses that now only should contain bitcoin cash tokens in your bitcoin abc wallet.
* Send them to an exchange that supports the trading pair and dump them
* Note that if you don't want to bundle your outputs out of privacy concerns, you should make a new exchange account for every output. (and use a VPN with different ip address and stock browser)

I don't think you have any idea how big the current margins are for miners, but I bet the Chinese mining farms are strategically placed so that their electricity cost is very low. So when their operational costs are negligent, there is no reason to stop mining, because they already bought the equipment.
In the worst case scenario, 50% of hash rate is pulled, since that will result in same pay-out as before the halving, so 90% is a ridiculous number.
This scenario isn't actually that new, we've seen the price dump 50% or more many times, which is basically the same as a 'halving'. Hash rate usually just kept going up, so my prediction is that we'll see at max a 10% decrease in hash rate.

That's absolutely wrong, bip148 is not a hard fork, but a soft fork. Bip148 will produce blocks that are also valid for the non-bip148 chain, but the opposite is not true. That's why it's not possible for the bip148 chain to get orphaned.

The age factor was there to prevent spam (sending the same coins over and over again would result in a very low priority because age of the coins would be very low). Nowadays priority is not used anymore, just the fee rate. I'm not sure if I understand your question.

Action you can do now: 
* Install the bitcoin abc wallet on a clean VM so that their malware won't be able to compromise your computer. Copy the blocks and chainstate directory from your .bitcoin folder to your .bitcoin folder of the bitcoin abc client so that you don't have to wait for it to sync.
Actions after the hard fork:
* Since bitcoin cash has replay protection, you can just send your proper bitcoins to a new address, your bitcoin cash tokens won't follow. (you can maybe check this on a block explorer, I don't know if they have one.)
* Now that your proper bitcoins are in a safe place, you can import the private keys of the addresses that now only should contain bitcoin cash tokens in your bitcoin abc wallet.
* Send them to an exchange that supports the trading pair and dump them
* Note that if you don't want to bundle your outputs out of privacy concerns, you should make a new exchange account for every output. (and use a VPN with different ip address and stock browser)

There is not a single alt that has a significant better scaling method than bitcoin. The average fee of a mETH tx is currently $1. source:  . You don't even see them complaining about the fees, because the whole fee drama in bitcoin was orchestrated to pump their altcoin that in reality even scales worse than bitcoin (see for example poloniex that had to stop ETH withdrawals because the whole network was congested because of some ICO, mETH uses an account system so you can't just pay a higher fee but you have to wait for your tx to get confirmed before you can do another one)

By promoting bitcoin unlimited, you are supporting a coup d'etat of the reference client from a few corporations with paid devs. You're supporting to deny users to participate in the network by running a full node because not a single normal user can afford a $20k node as your prophet Craig Wright was proposing. Your company is accomplice to the (most likely failed) attempt of destroying bitcoin as we know it.
On-chain scaling is only possible when you throw all the properties that makes bitcoin valuable out of the window. LN will enable cheap tx's, but we kinda need segwit for that, which your side is trying to block.

* no clue what bitcoin is
* no clue what problem bitcoin is actually trying to solve
* no intention of educating themselves
The early members of the bitcoin community that got interested in the subject because of ideological reasons is being overtaken by a mass of people who only care about making more fiat money.

It's because when you short bitcoin now, you're actually shorting (BTC + BCH), but bitfinex only sees it as a BTC short, so if you short BTC now and buy the same amount of BTC, you're getting BCH tokens without really holding bitcoins.

Is it really that hard to write an article about bitcoin without factual errors? I don't want to dissect the whole the article but just to make my point:


No, their argument is that decentralization is one of the main points that make bitcoin interesting and they think that bigger blocks will endanger that important value.


This is probably the most stupid error. Bitcoin's POW algorithm uses the merkle root of tx's in a block. This is a fixed size number regardless of how many tx's the block contains.

You're arguing with false numbers. The node statistics you see on numerous websites are the full nodes that also seed, if you just download bitcoin core you are only a leecher but you do full validation. So we don't really have statistics about how many people run a wallet with full validation.
But I agree with you, not enough people use a wallet with full validation and this is a problem that we need to solve with education and by making it really easy for people to use these wallets. It's crucial we make the required resources as low as possible so small blocks are a no-brainer. 
Coinbase profits from this step towards centralization because this will make them good friends with the regulators and will force people to use third parties to send and receive tx's.

And that's just wrong. You sold 10k bitcoin on bitcoinbuilder iirc. That means that 10k bitcoin should be deducted from the claim, not just the money you got from bb! 
You could have chosen to not sell those coins on bb and THEN you could have made your claim for $5M. 
It's the same when I now get 20% of my coins back and then sell the other 80% I didn't get on bitcoinbuilder.. I hope you see that that shouldn't be possible.

FRR rate on bitfinex is currently 0.038% per day. The bcu contract ends this year, that's still 214 days to go, so 1.00038^214 = 1.0847, so 8.5% by just lending them out, instead of 7% by selling your BCU tokens (and locking up BCC tokens till the contract ends)

No they don't, the users decide which chain they'll follow.


Exchanges will accept both tokens, it's in their interest because it will generate a LOT of trading fees. If you follow bitcoin development just a little bit, you'll know that core devs will not follow this hard fork. Wallets will probably also make sure that both coins can be used.

Well yeah that's what I thought, so they pay $480k a month.
So if they had 3% in October, they had around 7.5Ph, which gives around $600k a month at current rate.
edit: For current hash-rate, their break-even price is $175. That warehouse in the middle of nowhere and those workers are probably negligible.
@_date: 2015-02-06 23:34:02
Well, I don't know what they paid for their miners, but currently you can get 1Th for $200 on the retail market so that would give $130k a month if you only use them for one year.

It will actually all depend on how they will manage the bitcoin assets. You'll get a bit more than 20% if they mix bitcoin and fiat and if every bitcoin is worth $240. It's also possible that they will handle bitcoin and fiat separately, because in the balance sheets they don't even talk about the bitcoin assets. Or maybe they will take the value of bitcoin from the moment mtgox went bankrupt and calculate the liabilities to the customers according to that or ... well who knows.

I haven't had any issues yet because bitcoin is still a very small phenomenon, but bitcoin has a serious fungibility problem. It doesn't require much effort from governments to turn bitcoin into Orwell's wet dream. The EU is already proposing a database to link addresses to identities and bitcoin is still in its infancy. I think this will evolve into a whitelist provided by the government, and merchants will only be allowed to accept bitcoins from these approved addresses.
We are not there yet, and in current form, the lack of fungibility does change my behaviour. Especially when I need to pay somebody, I have to watch closely what address I use ( I use the coin control feature in Bitcoin Core) otherwise they can see that I have at least x bitcoins.
Other things I currently worry about, but don't really act on. I sometimes buy bitcoins on lbc. I have no idea what the background of these bitcoins are, and because of lack of fungibility I might become part of a crime investigation just because I bought some bitcoins.
