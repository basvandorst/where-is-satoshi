The public won’t care about decentralization, until they are censored from their money.
BTC is far more censorship-resistant than PoS coins.
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:57:01
Yes I agree.
Tether could be a major issue for BTC and all of crypto. 
Trillion-dollar lawsuit pending.
You haven’t really answered why you’re on a crypto chat forum, if you’re so pessimistic towards crypto.

We should check back in 10 years ;)

People will spend money on food, shelter, clothing, things they truly value.
People won’t starve to death to hoard money.
That’s a fallacy perpetrated by Keynesian economists, who want to inflate away debts.
@_date: 2019-10-09 19:33:34
You don’t know when I bought, or when I plan to sell.
So you’re just commenting baselessly.
@_date: 2019-10-09 14:10:38
If Trump outlaws on and off ramps, BTC won’t be the only crypto negatively affected.
If the hash rate drops, the difficulty algorithm will adjust. 
Do you know how many times people have declared BTC dead when the price drops?
It’s comical.

Institutional investors will be more interested as futures contracts become more robust, with more volume.
Also early.
@_date: 2019-10-21 23:56:10
People would absolutely accept the money.
They would accept it to pay their taxes.
They would also accept it due to legal tender laws.
A grocery store, for example, wouldn’t have the option to refuse fiat.
Neither would doctors, hospitals, utility companies, etc.
Again. I love and own BTC.
But as long as there are governments, there will be fiat.
@_date: 2019-10-09 11:49:07
Nothing in the BTC protocol suggests altruism IMO.
@_date: 2019-10-09 11:49:21
Thanks :)
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:09:14
I think fiat currency issued by countries is here to stay. 
I just think BTC offers digital scarcity, which will have value moving forward.
@_date: 2019-10-08 16:29:46
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:46:34
But wasn’t that based upon future expectations that BTC could be worth more in future? 
It was (and is) digitally scarce, so it could increase in value vs fiat even in 2009-10.
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:47:34
I’ll ask again:  what is a better bet than BTC?
BTC is currently difficult for the average person, I agree.
But it’s relatively early.
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:10:30
Most doctors will remain in the US, I can assure you.
Yes, people can convert their BTC to dollars, to pay the tax.
You conceded my point.
There will be US dollars.

Yes I like Monero.
I have found it a bit difficult to use.
My desktop struggled to download and maintain a full node, but I managed. 
Like so many crypto’s, Monero needs an easier UI for normies IMO.

I’m not waiting for the volatility to decrease anytime soon.
@_date: 2019-10-24 19:08:00
It takes quite a bit of time, effort, and licensing to become a physician in the US.
I just don’t see people leaving the US, to work in systems they don’t know, to earn less.
There are also licensing issues and language barriers when moving. 
The USD will be worth something, because the US government is involved in reimbursing millions of people.
Those people will be reimbursed in USD.
They will accept the those USD, pay taxes in those USD, and will be able to exchange them for goods and services with all the other possessors of USD.
Remember our exchange ten, twenty, or any time frame you want.
I’m very confident there will be millions of people using fiat.
Having said that, I’ll still be investing in BTC for the foreseeable future regardless.
@_date: 2019-10-08 14:39:42
Thanks for the thoughtful reply ����
@_date: 2019-10-22 18:41:33
Imagine a world with 25% unemployment.
A mother presents fiat to a grocery store to feed her baby. 
The grocery store owner says:  “sorry ma’am, BTC only.”
There are no political consequences.
You go ahead and keep believing that fantasy.
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:57:01
What was it designed to do?
Wasn’t scarcity a key component of the protocol?
What happens when demand goes up for a scarce item?
If miners didn’t think BTC would be worth more in the future, why bother to mine?
Surely they would know it would be a pointless exercise?
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:23:38
Capital controls exist now.
BTC hasn’t been hacked in ten years.
I don’t think BTC will “take over the world.”
But I do think it will be a digital store of value, censorship-resistant, and allow parties to transfer value without permission from third parties.
What other crypto tokens do you all think are likely to be more valuable than BTC in the medium to long term?
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:44:33
See previous reply.
The other possibility is that Tether is propping up the market.
I acknowledge that is a possibility, but it is not a fact.
@_date: 2019-10-21 16:35:45
I love BTC, and own a significant percentage of my net worth.
But fiat isn’t going away.
If unemployment ever reaches 25% in a developed country again, you can bet there will be massive government intervention in the economy and the money supply. 
But BTC can do very well without displacing fiat.
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:10:48
Demand has and will continue to go up.
Not overnight
@_date: 2019-10-09 17:27:45
Try to financially transact with a nation under US sanctions.
See how well that works for you. 
Curious why you are posting on a crypto chat.
Just here for the trading volatility?
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:23:12
I agree that BTC can collapse to zero under the right circumstances.
But as of 2019, BTC is the most liquid coin.
It’s not just market cap.
It is the coin most recognized as money on the market.
It has a fixed supply.
It is the most secure.
Again, it is the most liquid.
What other coin, after ten years, is more likely to replace it as a digital store of value?
We are witnessing the spontaneous emergence of a new monetary good, in the form of a scarce digital token.
It takes time for demand to grow, and price discovery to play out.
Hence the extreme volatility.
PoS permits more human intervention in the consensus mechanism.
@_date: 2019-10-08 14:37:58
BTW, my only position in crypto is BTC,
10% of net worth 
So there ��
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:58:34
What is the context of your reply?
I’m a little lost, due to replying to multiple people.
Are you saying fiat and Visa are better than BTC?
In terms of transfer of value, yes.
Problem is fiat is subject to capital controls and censorship, unlike BTC.
@_date: 2019-10-22 15:36:50
Government will force businesses to accept it, via legal tender laws.
@_date: 2019-10-09 19:14:33
Ok ����
@_date: 2019-10-09 17:40:43
I read Austrian economists. 
The idea that people hoard money is a myth.
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:27:19
That’s a pretty good example of how Keynesian economists see the world.
Now take some time to read some Austrian economists. 
“The Bitcoin Standard” by Saifedean Ammous is relevant here.
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:46:49
I understand the theory, and Austrian economics quite well.
The point is, governments are not going to give up fiat.
Why would they? 
They have too many ways to force people to use their currency.
Businesses that collect sales tax will be forced to collect the tax in fiat.
Healthcare providers that provide care to MediCare &amp; MediCaid will get paid in fiat.
Landlords with HUD tenants will be paid in fiat. 
All government employees will be paid in fiat.
Military contractors and soldiers will be paid in fiat.
The government is massively involved in reimbursing people in 2019, vs 1913.
@_date: 2019-10-09 14:44:47
BTC has the highest hash rate in crypto, even after dropping from ATH.
In terms of liquidity and security, what is better?
A PoS coin that can change its consensus easily?
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:51:41
I think BTC will still be volatile at £380,000.
Again, very early in price discovery of an emerging new monetary good.
@_date: 2019-10-09 17:24:20
There are absolutely capital controls in the West.
@_date: 2019-10-22 15:35:18
Suppose unemployment rises to 25% in an economic depression.
The government provides fiat to the unemployed, and forces businesses to accept it as legal tender.
You think people won’t use the fiat?
To think otherwise is delusional.
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:17:15
The supply is fixed.
The hash rate and thus security is high.
It takes years for demand to grow, when we are talking about the spontaneous emergence of a new monetary good, on a relatively free market.
Buy around now, sell if there is another parabolic run.
Wait for Mayer Multiple to drop back to .7-.8, then buy back in.
Have a position before 2024 halvening. 
That’s my 2 satoshis anyway ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:43:18
When a new monetary good emerges on the market, with a fixed supply, there is going to be extreme volatility as the price discovery mechanism plays out.
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:54:07
I agree that BTC is a big risk.
It’s only ten years old.
Gold has thousands of years of history.
But in terms of crypto, it is the oldest and most secure.
What do you think is a better form of scarce digital money?
@_date: 2019-10-21 21:17:10
The government would give it to them, in the case of high unemployment.
@_date: 2019-10-09 13:49:12
Very true.
But BTC is the most secure network.
It is also the most liquid.
Consensus is very difficult to alter.
10 years is a big head start on network effects.
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:58:58
He may have begun coding BTC prior to the crisis, but it gained popularity as a deflationary currency after people saw what kind of damage fiat can cause.
I agree the US home mortgage market was a major part of the crisis.
But fiat currency permits the excesses, correct?
@_date: 2019-10-12 02:21:23
This book explains why BTC will likely continue to dominate the crypto-marketplace. 
It’s more than the tech.
@_date: 2019-10-09 17:42:07
No I meant why are you chatting on a crypto channel, if you are so unimpressed by it?
Just here for the trading opportunities in crypto, due to high volatility?
BTC’s price rise since 2013  is proof that people are slowing adopting the deflationary currency, as a store of value.
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:47:10
Scarcity was built into the protocol.
Re-read the white paper.
There is a fixed supply.
It’s a deflationary currency.
Bitcoins are the first digitally scarce asset.
It was launched in response to the Financial Crisis of 2008-9.
That crisis was the result of fiat currency failing.
@_date: 2019-10-08 22:31:04
Thanks for your reply!
I think the value of BTC could become large enough, such that, when there are no mining rewards, the transaction fee will be mutually beneficial to the person changing the fee, and the person paying it.
For example, someone wants to transfer .25 BTC from France to China, year 2142.
The fee is worth paying, because it is lower than other options.
And the network is worth securing for that fee, because there are enough transactions.
@_date: 2019-10-09 13:58:23
The network effect is based upon the fact that BTC has the most liquidity and security in crypto.
@_date: 2019-10-09 19:43:25
Last chance to buy below $9000! ��
@_date: 2019-10-22 18:17:12
I think BTC will gain adoption over time.
That’s partly why I own a significant amount.
But I don’t think fiat will go away completely.
If there is massive unemployment, the government will issue fiat.
And businesses will be forced to accept it.
People will also be forced to pay taxes in fiat, including on crypto earnings. 
Governments and therefore fiat are not going away completely.
There are too many statists for that.
Tell me:  what happens when government fiat fails in modern states?
Do people use fiat for some purposes, or do they only barter, or use precious metals, or use crypto?
I’ll answer for you:  there is still a role for fiat.
@_date: 2019-10-09 00:09:37
That makes sense.
IMO, Proof of Work provides scarcity in a way that  Proof of Stake just cannot.
@_date: 2019-10-09 13:59:28
Of course it could fail.
But at this point, what is a better long-term bet?
@_date: 2019-10-09 19:20:29
There is no security, when a person is investing in a digital asset that is emerging on the free market.
It will be very volatile for quite some time.
@_date: 2019-10-08 16:26:30
Where is a good place for thoughtful discussion about BTC?
@_date: 2019-10-12 14:41:39
I plan to HODL if price goes lower.
The only reason I would sell is if prices rises parabolically.
Then I would sell and rebuy at Mayer Multiple about .7-.8 ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:47:35
Good point ☝��
@_date: 2019-10-15 16:02:58
Problem with gold:  it gets centralized in government central banks.
Also difficult to transfer across large distances.
@_date: 2019-10-21 17:27:22
The unemployed would use it.
So would taxpayers.
@_date: 2019-10-22 10:03:23
Yes, and then the government will issue another fiat currency to replace the failed one.
@_date: 2019-10-22 17:44:40
People would use the fiat, if for no other reason than to pay required taxes.
Paying required taxes is a use case by itself. 
By legal tender, I mean businesses would accept the fiat in exchange for the goods or services they are offering.
If they did not, they would bring the wrath of the government upon their business.
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:22:01
Now BTC needs better fungibility.
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:51:22
So I’m a doctor.
Many of the patients are covered by MediCare and MediCaid.
What happens when the government says:  “you must see these patients to keep your license.  And you must accept fiat for treating these patients?”
Furthermore, the government says:  “you must pay your taxes in fiat, under penalty of imprisonment.”
You don’t think the two examples above are government-enforced use cases?
By the way, healthcare is about 20% of the US economy and growing.
If the government ties licensing to accepting payment in fiat, that’s a big use case.
@_date: 2019-06-29 21:15:05
I own both BTC &amp; LINK.
There are countless use cases for smart contracts, but they need access to real-world data. 
Oracles provide that real-world data, and LINK does it in a decentralized way. 
Smart contracts can perform functions for businesses cheaper and more secure than they way things are typically done now.
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:41:03
Suppose a business is required to collect sales tax (hint:  almost all of them are).
And that sales tax is required to be paid in fiat.
Will fiat just go away?
Military contractors will be paid in fiat.
Healthcare providers reimbursed by MediCare &amp; Medicaid will be paid in fiat.
Government employees, including teachers, will be paid in fiat.
Landlords that have HUD tenants will be paid in fiat.
On and on...
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:56:48
I hold both BTC &amp; LINK.
The projects do different things.
BTC:  digital gold
Limited supply
Strong network effect
LINK:  decentralized network of oracles, providing real-world data to execute on smart contracts
Each coin can perform functions the other cannot.
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:22:27

@_date: 2019-10-09 19:13:45
Billions of people have an opportunity now to buy BTC.
If the rich want to buy it all up, they will have to pay the market price for it. 
It doesn’t seem to be that different than gold or other scarce assets in that respect.
