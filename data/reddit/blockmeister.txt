BTC sub began as a sub for big blockers before the BCH fork was a glimmer in anyone’s eye.

Is it people worried about high fees moving funds from non-segwit addresses outcompeting new Segwit use cases for block space? Segwit is growing, but if a number of people holding money in non-Segwit addresses (ie every long term holder) were suddenly worried about the outlook of their investment they’d have to out-spend Segwit transactions to move their coins.

HungDownLo probably wasn't using the exchange.
@_date: 2015-12-04 08:41:03
i don't know. There isn't a 100% trust free way to do this I'm afraid. However, the contract could be written to depend on more than 2 exchanges for redundancy, and that any exchange dropping out will send a release signal when they can no longer provide data. If all the exchanges shut down, the contract and everyone's coins are automatically released.

Bitcoin really only has two things going for it. Decentralization and a limited supply.

Well, if it depends on multiple exchanges reporting their price, I don't think the variable is too wide. The smart contract just has to know that a threshold has been reached. And this would have to be a smart contract, because it's a public statement saying that a person believes the price *will* rise so much that they will lock up their coins until it does so.

Yeah that's less of a metaphor and more of a lie. How does it help people understand Bitcoin?

Is there a way for one transaction to be blocked until coins in another address move?
@_date: 2016-03-09 03:21:16
This is what makes me wonder.. What if there was some sort of financial instrument that you could purchase that would be backed by a certain amount of bitcoin, but wouldn't be able to be spent until it attained a small amount of appreciation, say 5%. This would encourage slow steady growth of the currency's value by having people hold during bear months but spend on bull runs.

When your transaction is your ticket, you won't need a middle man like Ticketmaster to convert your dollars into an identifier in an arena's ticketing system. Also, Wikipedia says they employ nearly 7,000 people, so their costs aren't exactly zero.
@_date: 2016-01-25 04:18:27
Sure, but how many people can prove they are the recipient of the transaction by signing something with your private key?
@_date: 2016-01-07 07:45:40
It's always just a change in miner consensus away.
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:38:47
Did miners quit mining in protest of this as well? 42 minutes since the last block was confirmed..
@_date: 2016-01-25 06:02:45
Well I don't think it could reduced to a one step process under any scheme. You purchase the tickets and you present them at the door. The purchase is recorded on the blockchain, and the proof is generated by a BIP 120 capable wallet. You can read about it here:

Block size does not determine the quantity of blocks, relative hash power and probabilistic luck do. Block chain size is bound above by the block size limit and time.
@_date: 2015-08-13 14:38:48
I mean sure, 99.9% of altcoins start as a fork of bitcoind (the code base). But most people wouldn't call them forks because the vast majority (all?) of the 'altcoins' people are trading out there started with their own Genesis block.
@_date: 2015-08-13 15:16:49
You can hold that view, but you'll be the one out there solo mining it, because you're out of consensus. :)
@_date: 2015-08-21 03:15:24
This network effect you speak of applies to both chains more than anything else. One will win out. But the other is still way more dispersed than any other coin.
@_date: 2015-08-13 05:59:47
It's not a fork if the history of its blockchain doesn't branch off from some point of the bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2015-08-22 01:42:57
Assuming the fork goes along and fractures the community such that some people are willing to accept small-block Bitcoins, and others who accept XTcoins: if you had just withdrawn before the fork you'd be able to spend the coins on both chains. Otherwise you'll only be able to spend on whichever chain Circle or Coinbase deem to be the winner.
@_date: 2015-08-13 15:53:39
Since you're in the field of renaming things, what do you suggest we name what people currently refer to as forks, i.e. a splitting of an existing blockchain due to consensus rule changes?

Give it a more granular time range (I chose Jan '13 through today) and you don't see that uptick at the end.

To quote my friend the last time I asked him what Bitcoin was: "Bitcoin is so WEIRD." To quote another: "Bitcoin is GAY." For people who don't know anything about it, it definitely ruffles their feathers.

I don't see why any miner wouldn't support CPFP with those exact rules. To get an older transaction to confirm, a payee could just send one of her change address amounts to a new change address, but with a larger fee.

Because Bitcoin is an experimental currency and a $6,000 holding may or may not be a position OP could safely lose.

If my back of the napkin calculations are correct, assuming O(n^2) time complexity for verifying, 4x23's node would take 2 hours and 46 minutes to verify just one 20 MB transaction. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 23:52:15
M2M transactions are only useful when trying to convince a machine that you don't own to perform some action for you. I don't need to transfer money from my smartphone to my hypothetical smart car to crank it, public key cryptography handles that just fine without a blockchain.

Is this even about Bitcoin? That may be the vaguest non-answer I've ever heard in my life.

IANAL, but you may want to check with one to see if that counts as selling bitcoin (requiring you to apply for a money transmitter license).

I had not considered CPFP raising a knapsack problem before, so kudos for shining a light on my ignorance. It seems that treating any chain of unconfirmed child/parent transactions as a single transaction worth the sum of its fees would reduce it to the same complexity that we currently have for the problem of "which transactions do we include in a block."

Can you provide some data showing how much MMM users purchased during the run up?
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:57:13
Interesting problem. Bringing up that you'd prefer them not to post the transaction IDs on social media would likely discourage them from posting about your business at all. Do you really drive enough Bitcoin business that any useful information can be gleaned from their posts?
@_date: 2015-11-30 08:29:55
I see that as well, but... that's human perception for you.
@_date: 2015-11-29 13:08:26
Yes. Child pays for parent. Meaning if the transaction gets stuck, the receiver may create another transaction spending those unconfirmed coins to another address with a larger fee.
@_date: 2015-11-29 13:13:10
You could use the same address, but it's more secure to just move it another address because by creating the transaction you've revealed your public key.

I don't know what to think about advertising for bitcoin. Pros: Exposure is great. Cons: People generally associate as anything being advertised as being something that has an owner. I hope I'm not being a graybeard here.

Credit card information that is stored by all business storing payment information: the credit card number and the expiration date. Data not stored: the CCV on the back. So they wrote a script using the data they already have to remind users they might want to update their credit card information so the next time they go to buy Bitcoin with their credit card, they won't be denied. How's that creepy again?

If all that is securing Bitcoin is a wristwatch, then I can buy two wristwatches and double spend my transactions while blocking yours. Hash power must always be on the cutting edge or the system doesn't work.
