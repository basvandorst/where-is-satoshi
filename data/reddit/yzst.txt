How did you connect your app to a server showing real time prices + how accurate are the prices at any given time?

Good question! Have you ever stopped to consider how or why we've come to create a support system for the disabled? And I don't mean historically. What I mean is that on a purely logical level there are already enough people who care to support the disabled to pass laws that do so. So there is no reason to believe that changing the economic system would change the support systems for any particular group. 
Think of it this way. You pay your taxes which are partly used to support the disabled. Now you might say that you are paying against your will and that you wouldn't pay otherwise. But in either case there are still parts of your taxes that you would be more than willing to pay if they were not forced upon you (i.e. policing, the fire department, education) as they all act as a form of insurance that have positive externalities. If there are already enough people to vote in a law that protects certain groups then ought we not believe they will do the same in a Capitalist market? Capitalism is just democracy where you vote with your dollars. 
Imma keep it real tho. A lot of what I'm saying is theoretical and I don't think we should live in 100% capitalist society. I'm actually not again standard income but A LOT of work needs to be done before we can put that into place.

One could say that Communism leads to a more 'Totalitarian atmosphere' in the government. Making it more difficult for constituents to influence their representatives. Over time, this causes officials with insufficient experience (and public support) to be placed in positions of power. Inevitably, this type of government will eventually make a foolish decision - such as messing with the strongest nation in the world at the height of its power.

That's absolutely true. 
Capitalism is what we make of it!

There's a lot more to discuss on this issue. But a decent start nonetheless.

I think they look at it more like a temporary investment than a normal account balance. And given the fact that everyone's hearing about it, it seems like the type of thing most people would want to share. 
But I hear ya. I have 'friends' opening conversations with me about how they could've bought whatever amount at whatever time and I'm just like: 
mmmk...thx for sharing.

The tech isn't new. Just the way it's used is what makes it unique. Tbh all this crypto stuff isn't that big of a deal if you live in a developed nation with a stable/uncorrupted central banking system...imo.

I mean...it's true that Communism has never been 'fully' tried. But neither has Capitalism. Every nation in history has only ever been a mix of the two - leaning one way or another - but never fully achieving either. 
I'm a hardcore Capitalist btw. So I hear what you're saying lol.

I get that *most* of the users on r/bitcoin have a solid understanding of how bitcoin work but very few people (in general) understand how government policy works. 
We ought to take a moment to seriously consider how much we know. 
Also, I'm not really interested in debating whether or not it's possible because we would only be arguing the definition of regulation and/or the extent of it.

I was tryna be polite lol. Most Economics historians agree that political climate plays a role. Unless you're talking about economics within a bubble where real world influences have no effect. But that conversation's kinda pointless since you know... it  doesn't exist.
