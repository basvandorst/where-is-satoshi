\&gt;they literally told me they wouldn't do anything about it because I wasn't important enough
Lmao. Bull. Shit.

No it isn’t. Your economics is rusty.

100k+ bitcoin. Thanks for the laugh.

I mean it kinda is. People spend money and usually "buy more" with their time by working.
I'm a bit high right now so excuse me if that was stupid.

I’ve never been so sure of someone (you) being so uneducated in my life.

Pyramids and Ponzis aren’t the same thing. You are right that bitcoin isn’t a ponzi, but it very much is a pyramid scheme.

70% is correct.
(6,000-20,000)/20,000 = -.7 ...or -70%

OP you are fucking delusional.
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:49:24
Are you actually serious? The only way this remotely makes sense is if you mean there's no *risk-free* way of manipulating a market for profit. That I would agree with. But there are plenty of ways to manipulate a market for profit with varying degrees of risk. E.g., people in the inner circle of highly populated pump and dump groups make bank.

You need the price to be more than 8250 to win...yeah you're fucked.

This will literally never happen...bitcoin is totally unfit to be a major currency. Who in their right mind would want to risk their net worth plummeting by 75% in a few weeks due to speculation and market manipulation? I mean if you have a problem with how governments manipulate currency now, surely you realize that what they do absolutely fucking pales in comparison to how whales manipulate crypto prices.
A currency needs stability. Cryptos don't have that and are only profitable investments while people are willing to pay a price higher than you. This is a bubble. Blockchain tech is probably here to stay, but cryptos? Not until a well-regulated and stable crypto comes along...one that isn't subject to manipulation, price swings, etc...will there be a chance in hell of a crypto replacing fiat.

Who cares if it's deflationary when it's laughably overvalued?
@_date: 2018-07-19 07:09:22
Oh no! Whatever will they do without his 300 bucks!
OP unless this is one of your many bank accounts you probably shouldn’t be cryptoing. You don’t seem to have anything you can afford to lose.

50k to win 3k...yet I still like it. If bitcoin ever hits 50k I will eat Mcafee’s dick and floss with his ass hair.

I dunno man, shorting is looking pretty smart.


That’s really not true. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:02:15
False equivalence. Bitcoin is worth so much less than $6800 that shorting with low leverage is still a pretty smart move. I’m not saying it won’t go up today or tomorrow. I’m saying it will almost definitely hit 4-5k before it goes back to 13k.
