Are you allowed to say this?
@_date: 2015-12-18 22:13:22
I think internet used to be much faster couple of years back.
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:06:25
Any plans to roll this out to UK?

Someone has got a qr code.

WTF is this?
@_date: 2015-12-18 23:00:23
Nothing changed apart from blockstream's agenda.
@_date: 2015-12-20 16:46:43
Never with 1mb blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-22 14:38:43
what is wrong with it?
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:06:37
That's pseudo code
@_date: 2015-06-22 15:31:59
I find it very useful to play downloaded files on my TV. Others don't have this functionality. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 06:28:11
I used 'economic' fee on mycelium without any delays.
@_date: 2015-12-18 22:59:08
It definitely can't be more harmful than limiting the block size and increasing the fee which makes bitcoin almost useless for developing countries.
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:58:34
Makes me proud! 
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:50:33
I agree that this is an aggregate market and indian influence is not much yet but Chinese market has got lots of depth and it'll definitely impact market short term. Although longer term it shouldn't make any noticeable difference.   
@_date: 2014-12-24 01:03:57
Interesting, who has been selling then?
@_date: 2014-01-13 10:53:04
Deleted it! 
@_date: 2014-01-14 16:50:09
I think people are bit concerned about uncertainty in Chinese market. I guess most investors are waiting till early Feb.

Apologies if it is a dumb question. 
I'm new to Reddit, not able to grab that why would someone down-vote this post? 
@_date: 2014-05-28 14:23:52
Bullish not bullying.
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:59:48
I don't think they can regulate bitcoin directly however they can regulate points where it interacts with fiat, an obvious example will be exchanges.
@_date: 2014-12-13 04:10:10
40 minutes are a lot. Generally it takes about 10 minutes.  I would like to hear any expert opinion on this.

Great. I'm eagerly waiting to buy my groceries by bitcoin in London. Hopefully it will be soon! 
@_date: 2014-11-26 23:25:31
Much better. Thanks. Has anyone used it?
@_date: 2014-04-05 18:13:55
Most of my coins are on paper wallet created by bitaddress. Always keep some coins on my mobile in mycelium to spend wherever I find any opportunity.
@_date: 2014-04-05 15:29:22
Someone mentioned cryptodechange.com. Never used them before?
Couldn't find any FAQ section there.
Appreciate any comments or feedback!
* How much do they charge for delivery? 
* Which exchange rate do they use?
* Do you guys recommend them?  
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:02:57
This is great!
Unfortunately nothing in my area - E1 4RE :( 
@_date: 2014-04-12 13:31:52
May I ask where are you from?
You can also have a look at coinmap.org to check your local area.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:56:37
Seems like you have been around for a while but it's worth mentioning that day trading is very risky.  Not only you can potentially lose money on bad trades,  also any exchange can do what gox did without any warning. 
I personally only use exchanges to buy and move coins to paper wallet as soon as possible. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:48:28
Most likely he is not SN. Otherwise it's a tiny gift from community which I'm sure will be used for good cause. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:34:42
There is definitely some dark force pulling bitcoin to 666!
@_date: 2014-12-30 23:14:20
Now they don't even need paper to print more.
@_date: 2014-12-30 19:15:59
@_date: 2014-11-26 22:59:31
Thanks,  had a quick look. The sell price is more than 10 usd less than bitstamp. Not worth it i guess. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:33:49
Apart from multisig functionality, how is it different from localbitcoins?
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:58:52
Nothing has been confirmed yet, it's all speculation. Even if someone stole these BTC, it doesn't mean they disappeared. They are still circulating around. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 22:36:52
Great stuff mate. Hopefully 2015 will be better.  Merry Christmas! 
@_date: 2014-05-26 16:57:05

@_date: 2014-03-05 14:23:18
localbitcoins.com, use a seller with good reputation. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 10:24:00
Completely agree. If bitcoin survives, very likely it'll have lots of value and uses. If it doesn't then there wouldn't be any miners/nodes/network etc. and you will end up with nothing at all.
@_date: 2014-08-06 14:51:49
@_date: 2014-08-06 14:56:09
Got it! Thanks
@_date: 2014-02-24 13:44:27

@_date: 2014-04-06 19:56:21
@_date: 2014-12-23 23:58:51
It's better than nothing but ideally you should be able to change this option just before making transaction depending on priority. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:25:19
How exactly do you handle fiat?
@_date: 2014-01-14 11:57:23
So happy to read this article. Finally someone in media eventually talking about potential of bitcoin and how it can help  tackling issues that we have been unable to solve for decades.

I'm a UI developer and also in similar boat. Looking for a simple JavaScript solution for payment system. Not sure if it's possible. Something similar to bitpay setup. Client wants to retain bitcoins and 1% fee is not an option.
Found a nice tutorial but it's using PHP:
Not sure if pure JS solution exists?
 Any thoughts? 
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:55:35

Paper wallet is 100 times more secure than any online storage in my opinion. I personally created 10 addresses on a BIP38 paper, made three copies and stored on different secure locations. I've written down my password and also emailed myself some hints in case I lose that.
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:18:07
Does this work in UK?
It says your browser is set up to save but no option on order page?
@_date: 2014-12-27 11:18:51
He replied very honestly I think but digital currencies are not going to take 15 years to mature. My guess is 5 years max.
@_date: 2014-12-24 00:32:58
Disagree. 
You can understand core bitcoin protocol and not believe in its potential applications that will bring greater good.
Intention of original post was not to take price as progress indicator but measure it in terms of infrastructure and usefulness. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:17:50
I think it is a very good news for Bitcoin as it brings more legality and helps businesses to adopt and embrace this wonderful technology. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:17:12
Considering their price I'm not sure if it is a good idea to buy large quantities. Btec/bitstamp will be cheaper if you want to buy more than 2 btc at current price. Localbitcoins is better for anything less than this.
@_date: 2014-12-16 17:11:42
Good to know.  So which one has most competitive price?
@_date: 2014-01-15 09:59:43
I might be wrong, as far as I know you are not supposed to vote on bases of opinions rather quality of content? 
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:13:26
I think they mean cold storage at secure physical location.

I thing 1.05 is too high. There are plenty of people with great reputation selling at 1.01. I sold twice at market rate which served me pretty well considering exchange rate and remittance cost.  
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:28:57
One address should be fine but having multiple addresses helps in following cases:
1. If somehow that one private key gets compromised you lose all your coins.
2. You can spend coins more easily from cold storage.
3. You always have spare addresses for future use.

I have been doing front end development for many years. Moved from as3 to JS. Although I have done quite a lot JS and played with many libraries and frameworks but never really understood it deeply. I'm trying to go as deep as possible in JS because I might need to write an angular based library. 
I was also wondering about angular 1.3 and 2. I think it's worth learning 1.3/4 because it is not going to go away for long time. cordova/ionic sounds interesting. I personally wanted to try different workflows such as angular/requirejs or angular/browserify etc. I'll be on this for next month. Let me know if it makes sense to crack this together. Cheers!

@_date: 2014-04-05 16:12:38
Thanks for providing this info. I have asked them same questions, they should really have FAQ page.
Their live support is not replying either. I'll def try them if they get back to me.
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:19:28
It might work in future. Developers are working on a layer on top of core protocol to make micro transactions faster and efficient. These transactions don't need to interact with blockchain directly. 
@_date: 2015-05-16 08:38:15
I understand what you are saying but unfortunately I didn't know about Bitcoin till 2013. I would have done my research if I knew about it. 
I still strongly believe that this is just a beginning. We are going to witness many imaging things built around btc protocol and I'm proud to be part of it.

Coloured coins, side chains, WWL, parallel chains and rest of the fancy terms are absolutely useless without bitcoin being valuable.

It is bit early for general population to understand bitcoin. With time I hope volatility and awareness will increase and I genuinely believe we'll get there.

@_date: 2015-01-05 13:29:33
Wow, seems like it works!
@_date: 2015-01-18 23:29:11
Yes I have android. I used to have it then it disappeared.  Is it location specific? 
@_date: 2015-01-11 23:37:48
Why? There is nothing wrong with Bitcoin. 
It was a mistake if you got in for quick profit. I bought some at 900, 600, 300 but I'm not willing to take any loss. I'm in for loooong term. 
Anyway,  best of luck for your next investment!

If you can find one on Amazon then use purse.io.
Scan.co.uk also accepts btc.
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:24:54
You really don't need to wait for confirmation unless you are doing $1000+ transactions.  Chances of double spending are very very slim.
Most of the wallets have implemented standard fee. Even transactions with 0 fee get included to block eventually. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:58:21
They certainly contribute.
@_date: 2014-01-31 14:38:47

Well, you have to use an exchange if you want to buy. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 12:16:03
Anyone used this?
@_date: 2015-01-08 14:59:44
It indeed happened but generally it is very safe. Now they introduced $10000 insurance as well.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:20:58
As long as core protocol is sound everything will be fine. This volatility is good for equal distribution.

@_date: 2015-01-06 19:35:07
Bitstamp buying?
@_date: 2015-01-03 10:59:45
I understand that micro tipping is game changer in countries such as india but it's something that bitcoin is not able to achieve at the moment. .0001 fee translates to 2 rupees approx which is not acceptable for poor even at these low prices. Please explain me if I'm missing anything here.

What are you trying to say?
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:32:07
I think opposite will happen. People will convert fiat to btc and get the hell out ASAP.
@_date: 2015-01-06 14:53:02
I think we are making good progress. Didn't read the article but title is much better. Not like how it used to be, 'bitcoin hacked'.
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:05:46
Isn't it improving as ur numbers suggest? 
This is all part of the game. If it doesn't kill makes you stronger. My money is at risk as well but at the same time I'm not to worried. In fact this will encourage us to make more secure tools before we go mainstream.

I wouldn't suggest using purse for buying coins if you have any other option. It is expensive option but safe for buying. 
I have used them many times for buying on Amazon without any issues. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:36:25
I think this is an attempt to spread FUD. Why don't to ask bitstamp about the issue before posting it here?
@_date: 2015-01-07 12:28:02
No, it defeats the purpose of creating bitcoin at first place.
@_date: 2015-01-04 17:27:34
It could still very well be 2015. This could be a golden buying opportunity.  
Who knows.
@_date: 2015-01-07 23:54:46
That's a great news.
I have used your service many times without any problem. 
Quick question, how do the refunds and warranties work if you buy from third party seller because Amazon doest cover it?
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:43:59
I'll definitely take 5%.
@_date: 2015-01-03 11:19:11
Could someone please tell me that why did they temporarily block github? It has nothing to do with anything.
@_date: 2015-01-28 11:59:45
Very good news indeed. There are millions of software companies in india. It will be great for adoption if this trend picks up.
@_date: 2015-05-16 07:18:01


Gutted I didn't find this article in 2011 and followed his advise.
@_date: 2015-01-05 13:44:47
I made a deposit on 31st which has not been confirmed as well.
@_date: 2015-01-31 23:36:36
Now that is a million dollar question.  Wish I knew.
@_date: 2015-01-16 18:18:16
Why the fuck are you pimping this moron. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:45:26
Not gonna happen. They only lost 5m which is not a huge amount for Bitstamp. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 11:40:02
Ask them to install any wallet and send them bits? Am I missing something? 
@_date: 2015-05-11 12:46:58
Cash is always more risky. Always deal with someone who has bit of history and decent reputation in public place. I personally find bank more convenient.  
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:11:33
I bought at 900, 600, 300, 270 and still buying. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:55:18
Bull shit
@_date: 2015-01-16 12:41:09
You need to use an exchange then, Btcxindia or unocoin. Or try to sell on localbitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:30:00
It should be more stable than gold because mining is predictable, limited supply and it has thousands of more uses than gold. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 16:31:28
When did you start doing it. What percentage have you lost/gained? 
@_date: 2015-01-01 02:54:57
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:06:12
So which bank are they going to use?
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:03:45
Wtf is this?
@_date: 2015-01-12 13:25:24


Bitcoin is much more useful now than a year back. Its future looking very bright to me. I'm sure the price will catch up too. It might take a year or 5.
@_date: 2015-01-09 12:42:50
I'll get coins out.
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:49:51
This link tells you how to do it.
Also more fees doesn't always mean faster transaction. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 11:08:36
I'm sure someone will answer these questions or you should be able to find answers yourself. These topics have been discussed many many times here. 
However I feel you are missing the point, bitcoin doesn't always need to compete with traditional banking, it can also complement it. 
Lots of indians are abroad so people supporting their agenda/party will be able to donate easily using bitcoins.   
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:15:21
I got introduced to btc by reading a story about dude investing few quid and then forgetting. One day it turned into millions!
@_date: 2015-01-05 14:56:13
I didn't take any risk for cheap coins. Things were stable when I did deposit. I don't care much about price if I get money back. I'm not doing any trading, I believe in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-07 01:04:15
Up here in UK
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:08:19
This is true. I got  one as well. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 23:15:52
Crazy shit!
@_date: 2015-01-25 10:41:10
Agree but that market is tiny. You should try to make this service attractive to as many btc holders as possible. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:34:07
You can get gift cards or vouchers from pock.io. 
Purse.io is another option but make sure you don't use third party seller in case or return/refund.
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:32:10
Converting back to fiat for merchants is not a problem if you have easy access to coins. We need more services like circle in all countries. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 17:24:23
Either bitcoin will be worth a lot more that 300 or nothing in next 5 - 10 years. 
I got in at 900 and have no regrets. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:25:18
I think drops, bubles and volatility is decreasing as market matures.  I don't think we'll go much lower than 250 but what do I know?
@_date: 2015-01-12 11:54:52
Not even at $10,000.
@_date: 2015-01-05 13:54:03
I'm less worried about losing money but more upset about missing this golden opportunity to buy. Anyway lets hope for best and prepare for worst.
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:54:49
This is pointless.  The issue is to convert fiat into crypto. Once you are in crypto world, conversion is not an issue
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:19:15
No coins but recently made a fiat deposit.
Going to buy coins and send them to cold storage for 5 years at least.
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:33:38
Market needs confidence more than anything else at this point.
@_date: 2015-01-10 19:24:04
Because most took fiat or coins out I guess.
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:24:51
I'll buy bitcoins ASAP and get them out. I think many will do this.
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:24:31
@_date: 2015-05-08 11:03:44
Tried expedia &amp; cheapair but couldn't find any reference to btc in payment?
@_date: 2015-01-04 11:25:12
Then I wouldn't have spent 900/coin but honestly I don't care much about price if technology is going forward. I hope one day Bitcoin will be used for greater good.
@_date: 2015-05-20 15:00:46
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:27:48
Bitcoin supply is also predictable,  does that matter?
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:36:46


Hope they live up to their promise. I'm skeptical at the moment. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 00:08:18
Had a look strangely 'diasble local trader' is not checked? 
@_date: 2014-05-11 11:44:10
This 
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:13:22
someone got it working via tor.
@_date: 2015-07-17 00:31:29
Where can i find this data?
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:27:26
@_date: 2015-07-15 23:17:53
fucking hilarious!
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:40:14
thank you for your kindness sir!
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:27:00
I have been using it for long time without any issues. This is not good.
@_date: 2015-07-12 15:14:30
It is always risky. What if there will be no correction?
@_date: 2015-07-12 16:34:56
wow, that is brilliant!
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:12:44
how do you do this?
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:29:14
Do they use faster payments?
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:33:45
Any charity pls
@_date: 2015-09-15 20:06:54
I got this as well.
@_date: 2015-09-22 17:40:18
Cooffee table, bean bag and rug from amazon uk by purse at 20% discount 
@_date: 2015-09-12 15:19:10
They were never reliable.
@_date: 2015-11-04 09:17:48


Hodlers NEVER sell!
But seriously I want to know this as well.
@_date: 2015-11-24 22:17:30
I guess they also support UK?
@_date: 2015-11-12 15:22:42
Blockchain and banks are always down. Good combo!
@_date: 2015-10-15 12:35:21
Keepassdroid doesn't take btc.
@_date: 2015-11-18 19:56:30
I have used them many times without any issue.  Upto 20% discount gets picked quite quick.
@_date: 2015-10-28 16:31:44
I'm skeptical if we'll see 1000 this year but looks very likely next year.
@_date: 2015-10-01 17:27:04
Just use a proxy.
@_date: 2015-02-16 18:41:14
Still there is plenty of time to make a deal but if Greece goes out, it might impact bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 04:14:02
I love the fact that no one can really prove if you own some!
@_date: 2015-02-02 21:22:55
Nothing new here. There are already many apps doing this. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 18:24:13
Mainstream articles are getting bit better but comments are still painful to read. 
@_date: 2015-10-23 15:51:47
TATA steel having hard time in Europe but good to see them investing in btc.
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:25:30
This is why we have alt coins. Can we implement this in btc? 
@_date: 2015-02-04 14:04:37
Definitely you should accept bitcoin.  If you can't take the risk then use service like Bitpay to do the instant conversion to your  local currency. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 21:15:32
very good step by purse. Finally a reason to buy and spend btc for everyone.  We need to find more use cases like this.
@_date: 2015-10-16 19:47:06
Please don't start this again. It's not even funny anymore.
@_date: 2015-02-10 04:32:42
One of us. One of us!
@_date: 2015-02-13 14:54:10
I have used purse many times with success however i do have some rules.  I generally don't buy any electronic stuff.  It could be pain to return items if there are any  issues. Also risk is more with more money.  Your choice! 
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:11:22
They definitely do especially when it comes to updating ancient systems.
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:41:48
I think that was fake. Can't see them doing testing in production. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 05:11:07
Do you have HD?
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:20:57
I'm genuinely interested, how is this compromised? 
@_date: 2015-02-18 09:12:09
Very interesting indeed but isn't it only for small distance communication. can't see this tech being used for transmitting huge data across cities/countries? 
@_date: 2015-10-27 22:34:30
It is thai baht, not btc.
@_date: 2015-02-13 05:34:59
strange. I tested from electrum and it worked fine as you said. Sure it didn't work last time. I was using bitstamp though. 
Anyway thanks for looking into this. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 08:33:35
Understand that. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 08:33:12
Thanks. Considering this for short term. Seems like much better than mobile wallets. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 11:12:42
HODL! !!
@_date: 2015-02-21 23:28:29
It uses 128-bits random seed to generate its private keys. Any wallet supporting this will work. Your coins are safe if you have seed!
@_date: 2015-02-19 19:22:51
Totally agree. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 05:47:31
I'm in UK. No bitcoin option for me unfortunately. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:53:34
Why the fuck still people think universe revolves around US?
@_date: 2015-02-07 00:05:14
Bitcoin is here to stay witches! Everything else will fade away.
@_date: 2015-02-13 05:10:46
Old mycelium used to report tx immediately.  Maybe HD version does not support it.
@_date: 2015-02-13 05:39:45
Seems like u have lost dude.
@_date: 2015-02-13 07:30:13
Thanks
