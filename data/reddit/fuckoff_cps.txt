Up to you. Dont really care till they play fair themselves. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:51:26
Has to be. Look at what time zone its happening in and who would be awake to manually intervene on their stops. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:42:52
Theres actually a head and shoulders on the hourly chart and on the monthly chart. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:26:13
Is there a single regulated exchange? 
Bitfinex already started suing people that are asking questions. And that whole tether thing....
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:23:20
You mean when you were an extra early adopter? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:42:37
SELL SELL SELL FUCK YOU ALL
ONLY SO I CAN BUY A WHOLE BITCOIN AT 10
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:52:54
How convenient. Almost like the shit head rule where if people start panic selling an asset, big brother steps in to suspend trading.
And in 2008 when they stopped allowing short positions at times. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:21:01
Id put more in if I didnt have to pay 4 dollars to move 50 bucks of bitcoin or have all my shit still stuck in bitfinex. Till they fix all that shit, I dont see any educated person willing to put significant money into this at this level. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:15:05
It is when you control the 20% growth. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:37:49
Why the fuck should they report gains on taxes if they wont allow write offs for losses. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:03:36
Anyone else happy all the idiot money is flowing out of bitcoin? We can finally have a usable fuck tard free mem pool
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:44:47
Lol another crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:39:45
IOTAs going through that right now. See what their solution is 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:45:51
Again, pushed by people riding the wave screaming hodl not knowing what they are doing or what even the fuck bitcoin does. That wave is still a mile out to shore... but when it reaches shore, transaction fees will be in the 3 digits and people will kill themselves when they cant exit their over leveraged positions. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:58:00
It's very hard to purchase or sell iota recently because it's been spammed to shit and there aren't enough nodes is my understanding 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:55:06
Let me know what you think. Someones been spamming a vulgar message on IOTA essentially doing what you described the past few days. Not sure if the developers found a solution 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:40:12
This is why you don't throw money into something you dont understand. Sorry about Christmas. Hope you get your family gifts though. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:53:03
on gdax?

The point is "the law" doesn't mean anything unless you go about touting your gains to the wrong people 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:58:13
Wouldnt it just equalize out?
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:21:10
More dumb money in play. Love it. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:30:10
Throwing any extra money you have lying around into the bitcoin money doubling machine is the same thing as leveraging yourself in my mind. You're leveraging your future and what would have been ordinary retirement savings or mortgage paydowns. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:30:39
And bitcoiners have a problem with 0k because...?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:45:10
Bitfinex is still fucking everyone over. All my shit hasnt been confirmed in 3 days now leaving me at the mercy of the market. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:00:42
I had gotten some free coin from the other split before this one... but  yeah hopefully someone else knows how to navigate this 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:51:40
Youre deluded if you think the bitcoin price in USD doesn't push mental support and resistance levels. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:06:11
Yes that was the deal. Fuck off
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:19:29
You are full of shit. You're going to eat some cashews or some shit or some other bullshit. Anything but your actual testicle. Fuck you. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:40:46
You think more than 10% invested in bitcoin knowing what it was? Or was it the fact that it was a meme and people saw it as magic money doubling machine? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:35:28
Been waiting for 2 years now 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:56:02
Yeah fuck this there's no rationale left in this. Selling and out. Good night. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:42:20
im on blockchain.info do you know off head what happens? I basically bought in 2014 and have no clue what the fuck im doing. Just letting it sit in that online wallet thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:06:23
I dont think people are cashing out either. Its holding at 10K and keeps inching up right now. I'll wake up tomorrow and it will be 10200. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:47:53
Weren't those all news related? So unless some other negative news comes out, I don't forsee any reason for it falling unless people start cashing out. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:57:28
November 16. I have my downpayment tied up in this. Going to kill myself if the fork causes a crash. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:38:23
Does it matter? I dont care if idiot money comes in for the wrong reasons. We all still get rich and exit when new money stops flowing.
