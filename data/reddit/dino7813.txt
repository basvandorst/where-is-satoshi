Well I doubt any sophisticated attacker would try to steal it all. They would come to the same conclusion as you did.  But if you could steal a reasonable amount and figure a way to unload it quickly that would be the way to go about it. Once it is uncovered, then there would be a commensurate price drop.  
But what if they were extra sophisticated and could target lost coins somehow?  Coins lost in computer upgrades, death of owners, etc., that could possibly down with no long term price impact.  Maybe the could target long term holders somehow, such that it might be a very very long time before to owner realized their coins were gone.

It’s an interesting question, I’ve wondered if when quantum computing becomes more prevalent will the first bad actor that decides to attack it be able to easily break the chain, steal bitcoin with impunity?  Probably.  How far away are we from that?  10 years maybe?  Could there be a layer of security placed over the block chain based on quantum encryption to protect against this? Maybe, but effective defenses often lag behind offensive actions.

It would explode.  It’s been the best investment return of the last decade.  People, especially wealthy people, will be looking for an investment vehicle outside of the normal market influences.  Will there be enough of those folks buying in to counter those that find themselves needing to dump it to make gains to counter market losses?  Or even average people that need to dump it because they need liquidity due to being laid off or loosing income streams?  I think so.  I see a recession as the best thing that could happen to it.

Well look, there’s always a bottom coming.  But here’s the thing, the long term trend has always been up.
