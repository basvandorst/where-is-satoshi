People talk. People repeat what they have heard. I understand the "time to sell is when your taxi driver gives you stock advice" but I disagree that "coffee shop grandmas and construction workers yamm(er)ing about BTC" is a bad thing. Rather, it points to wider awareness and recognition of Bitcoin and crypto's legitamacy long-term.

$15k will be considered a low-water mark in a few years. (crazy-ass speculation of mine, far from scientific, but it is what it is)

Yes, it's a distinct threat, but it is not limited to crypto.

Gender DIVIDE. I didn't say shit about barriers to entry.
There are literally zero barriers to entry into the ocean for a swim, but my wife won't go in the water. I will. That's a divide, a difference in personal choices. And we are opposite genders. That's my point. Not that women _can't_ get into crypto, but rather that, by and large, they don't _want_ to.
Chalk it up to risk aversion, or whatever the reasons are.

It really only serves to further the gender divide in crypto.
Female is a Nocoiner, male is a Bitcoiner.

It's Bitcoin Cash or BCH.

Do you have to pay tax when you move a five dollar bill from your back pocket to your front pocket?
Same with crypto. Transfers without a change in ownership are not a taxable event.
My opinion, DYOR.

Yeah, friends new to the space fall for it all the time. I get a phone call or a text: "Guy on TV just said BTC was going to $100k"  etcetera

But when he finally came back...

Hmm... seems oddly familiar... varied organizations and individuals and entities working on similar yet different emerging methods of transacting with others across a distributed network of nodes...

I buy the dip while wearin' green &amp; I buy the dip in New Orleans.
I buy the dip in Arkansas &amp; I buy the dip off your weak hands y'all.
I buy the dip while skippin' rope &amp; I buy the dip instead of dope.
I buy the dip with fiat paper &amp; I buy the dip with Morley Safer.
He buys the dip even though he's passed &amp; I buy the dip 'cause it's worked in the past.

Transferring WITHOUT a change in ownership is NOT a taxable event. I'm teling you this. You already know it, you just want to be wishy-washy about it.

When I say "BCash", you say "Kicks ass"
Kicks ass!
When I say "BCH", you say "Set 'em straight"
Set 'em straight!

Gawd. Stop wondering
 Find out for yourself.
You are smart. Stop wondering and listening to hearsay.
Read from the direct source.

The IRS has a friggin website
Read some tax code.
We aren't your paid CPA or Tax lawyer.

Yeah, but basically every civilized country on the planet has capital controls and Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering regulations and even if a country doesn't have such laws and regulations, International Law is there.
So, an easy and reliable method of verifying one's identity in the Digital Age is a valid pursuit.

Actually, full-page adverts in widely-circulated publications is just about as mainstream as it gets.
