There is also a small fee per listing that you post, and they expire after 6 months and you need to pay the fee again. They also make money from people paying for ads for their items as well.

You will see the "current balance" that they owe you for mining but you have not been paid yet. However the money they were going to pay you with is no longer there. If we get lucky they will somehow find a way to pay what they owe to miners, but that seems unlikely at this point.

He probably games too man, the person who takes 2 months to mine $60 with one card is not the person you should be mad at.

I loved my 7.5! Ended up going back to 7.75 after that deck though.

Yep. This is what prompted me to change wallets. Super happy I did instead of waiting for them to implment it

Think of it this way, How much would you get paid an hour if you put that $300 in Bitcoin and the price of bitcoin doubles in the next few years?
Might be worthwhile long term :)

I would check on Etsy, at the very least may be able to find somebody to make you a custom one.

Planning on accepting bitcoin at a geek themed craft fair in Wisconsin in October, will let you know how it goes! At the very least I expect it will yield some questions. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 04:20:23
It worked out pretty well! Had a few conversations with fellow bitcoin geeks and had a sale in bitcoin as well!

You can also use Nicehash and a gaming rig( or any rig really) to get mining. Nicehas makes moning easy mode.
