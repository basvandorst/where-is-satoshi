Exchanges try to match buy orders with sell orders and vice versa. What happens when someone wants to buy/sell 1.1 BTC? It's a lot easier to match them with a 1 BTC and a 0.1 BTC order than to wait for someone with the exact same order amount.

Correct. Right now taxation is efficient because the taxing authorities are able to offload the cost for tax compliance onto businesses (and ultimately to their customers in the form of higher prices). If the taxing authority had to go around with an army of tax collectors, things would be a lot more difficult. 
Tax avoidance incentives would likely come into play as well. People would simply rent instead of own land, or move frequently to stay ahead of the poll tax.

There are several posts claiming DDoS without a single shred of evidence.
Here's reality folks: people who got in early are taking profits. This is causing the price to drop. MtGox was never designed to handle the kind of traffic it's getting right now. When ignorant newbs see the price drop, they panic. Getting trades executed on MtGox right now is like trying to herd 20,000 cattle through a 5-foot gate. The herd panics and the sell-off begins. Seasoned investors who know to look for these panic sell-offs sit back and buy into the massive dips thereby making profits at your expense.
The only ones manipulating this market are ignorant newbs who don't know anything about investing. 
How to know if you're an ignorant newb? Have you ever:
Posted a screenshot of the bitcoinity chart?
Posted a meme when the price moved 10%?
Asked r/bitcoin if you should invest?
Posted an announcement that BTC reached some arbitrary milestone?
Posted that MtGOX lag is due to lag and/or market manipulation?
Made a claim that BTC is different and not subject to the same laws of economics like every other investment?

This is what I was thinking. I'm no economist, but it seems to me that BTC's near-infinite divisibility gives it the kind of liquidity a BTC-dominated economy would need, right? 
For example, if everyone started hoarding BTCs such that 90% were effectively "off the market" then that would still leave something like 210 trillion satoshi available for trade which is plenty, even on a global scale.

If you read through the comments on the linked OP, the guy who owned the account claims that it was a current (i.e. non-interest paying) account used for operating his business. He was not receiving any interest on the account - in fact he was paying fees to the bank to keep it liquid. This was the amount of money he needed to stay solvent (covering AP/AR, paying employees, etc). He couldn't keep less than EU100k in the account or else he wouldn't have had enough to cover his ongoing expenses.

The other exchanges have every reason in the world to expose MtGOX if they were in fact manipulating the market. Every other market would gain big time if MtGOX fell. For exchanges, it's not just about profits at the margin - it's about volume. Right now, MtGox has 10 times the volume of its closest competitor. You're crazy if you don't think they would take that volume, even if it meant a temporary dip due to a sell-off.

The "deflationary problem" you referenced is illusory and I'll explain why.
The bitcoin currency base is a potential 2.1 quadrillion monetary units. That's quadrillion with a 'Q'. Also, this is not a hard number. It can be adjusted up or down as required. This fact is lost on most people.

Bitcoin is NOT a deflationary currency right now. It is an inflationary currency. Every 10 minutes, 25 new bitcoins appear and new bitcoins will continue to appear every 10 minutes for the next 140 years. Once all of the bitcoins have been mined, then it will become deflationary.

Well, the way you structured the scenario, I bought my friend's goat-raising services for dirt. 
Just because there was a currency exchange doesn't make the OP's claim any less accurate yet you, for some inexplicable reason, are hung up on its precision. You want to deconstruct the entire trade and then make a big deal about the fact that there was an extra step involved. To this I ask, so what? What's your point? Currency itself is an intermediate step in the trade process. 
Let me use another example. Let's say I give a builder a bunch of cash to build me a house. The builder orders materials, hires subcontractors, and proceeds to build the house. By your logic, it would be illegitimate for me to claim that I bought a house with cash. You would instead point out that, in fact, I bought the services of a contractor and he had to go through all of these additional steps to actually build the house - after which you would probably make some bizarre analogy to dirt farming and goat shares. 
Yet, if I told anyone (other than you, it seems) that I bought my house with cash, they would all instantly understand that what I said was entirely accurate.

It really doesn't make sense to apply macroeconomic principles to an early adoption curve. What bitcoin is experiencing is a special economic case that is not necessarily indicative of long-term trends. 10-20,000 people (maybe more by now) are queued up to buy a finite amount of bitcoins. That's why the price is climbing. 
We can talk about deflationary trends once the price of bitcoin settles. To discuss it now is meaningless.

This tinfoil-hat theory only works if this super-secret-squirrel cabal of bitcoin barons can find buyers for all of their coins. 
However unlikely this scenario is, the only effect will be to more widely distribute bitcoins to a larger pool of holders - dilution, if you will. And yes, this never-going-to-happen event would also depress the price of bitcoins for a time.
Would "normal" people - whatever the hell that means - get "screwed over"? Um, not unless they were ignorant newb speculators who bought into a double exponential growth curve hoping to make a quick buck. Those poor devils will continue to suffer the effects of a market correction. 
But for those who bought with the intention of holding long-term because they understand the fundamentals of the underlying technology and its potential to change the socioeconomic order - those folks will be just fine.

If, at some point in the future, bitcoin replaced every national currency on the planet (global M3 money supply today is ~$60 trillion USD) then the value of 1 BTC would be $2.85 million USD. A satoshi would therefore be $0.028 USD which is plenty granular.
Even if 3/4 of the BTC were lost, a satoshi would be worth $0.11 which is probably granular enough for most transactions. That said, the addition of a 9th decimal position would make the smallest denomination around a penny.

Solving the block is like rolling a pair of dice and trying to get double sixes. If I roll the dice once per second, I should expect to get double sixes about once every 36 seconds *on average*. However, it's possible that 60 or 90 seconds could go by between double sixes or I could roll double sixes twice in a row. Extreme deviations from the norm are rare and expected.

The currency exchange was completely understood by everyone...even the OP, who mentioned it within the first paragraph. Everyone understands that in this particular instance, an intermediary was used to facilitate the trade. There wasn't any attempt to keep this secret. We all understand what happened. 
Yet, all of that is completely irrelevant. From the perspective of the OP, bitcoin was spent and groceries were received. From OP's perspective, groceries were bought for bitcoin. It's exactly the same as if you use a credit card to buy something in a foreign country. The credit card company is the intermediary in this case, and there will certainly be a currency exchange at some point, but from your perspective you will have paid for those goods in dollars (assuming you live in the US).

Bitcoin is barely four years old but it has only gained *marginal* acceptance in the past 12 months. You want to get to maturity tomorrow but it's not going to happen.
General acceptance of BTC as a viable alternative to fiat currencies will take on the order of decades if for no other reason than momentum. Even if everyone suddenly *wanted* to switch to BTC, they couldn't. The amount of leverage in the current system is staggering beyond comprehension and will take a generation or more to unwind. 
In the face of this reality, worrying about intra-day price movements is the very definition of pointless.
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:49:27
Although it may not seem like it, bitcoin needs speculators. By driving up the price, they are injecting a lot of capital into the bitcoin economy. This is incentivizing businesses and entrepreneurs to start offering goods and services for sale. A $2 billion market cap attracts a lot of attention.

The number one reason that these kinds of articles irk me is because the so-called "analysis" is invariably comparing apples and oranges.

There is absolutely no service that governments provide that a private organization could not.

Prices are parabolic, but that does not by itself necessarily mean that a crash is imminent or likely. I do believe that a lot of the people flooding into the market will likely be gone within a few months. People are trying to jump on the bandwagon - a lot of the posts on r/bitcoin are of the variety, "I don't know anything about bitcoin and I've never invested in my life! I'm scared! What do I do? Please, take my money!" These folks likely don't understand the real value of bitcoin and will not be able to stomach the volatility of the market. A few corrections and they'll cash out a few dollars poorer and with a bad taste in their mouths. 
The real value of bitcoin, however, is slowly being recognized by more and more people who have been waiting for just this moment - and there are millions of them out there. As they awaken, they will buy and hold - participating in the bitcoin economy. So, while there will certainly be corrections as early adopters take profits and amateur speculators retreat, it seems unlikely that a majority of knowledgeable traders will sell off en mass. Instead, they'll buy on the dips. Just look at the PM markets to see what this will look like over the long term. Run-ups, corrections, then long-term sideways trading.

Apparently, the newer ASICs rigs are priced to break-even after only 1 month. However, the price of the rig plus the waiting time of several months is a bit of a barrier for most people. So yes, it's easier for most people to just buy bitcoins.

This is the case in direct p2p transactions just like if you were paying cash to someone on a street corner. However, there's nothing stopping a 3rd party from underwriting a particular transaction.

Nor do I. The largest and/or the most corrupt governments (but I repeat my self) might but I think a lot of other governments will simply view it as a novelty. It's a big threat when yours is the world reserve currency, not so much otherwise.

Nowhere in the OP did I see mention of the United States. This line seems to imply that the OP was talking about all governments:

Is it possible - yes.
Is it likely - no. 
Reason: everyone would have to be willing to sell. This alone means that it probably would never happen. Some people would hold out just to be dicks. But, assuming that the rich individual *did* manage to buy up every last BTC, then what? They would essentially hold a monopoly on a worthless currency. Everyone else would simply move to a different currency.

It may temper expectations, which is a good thing.
The ideals underpinning bitcoin are new and foreign to 99% of the population. It will take a generation to challenge the ossified thinking of the great mass of people. BTC needs to build trust and credibility over time. Four years is simply not enough. 
Don't worry about today. Even with the massive publicity BTC has received, you can probably ask any random stranger on the street about it and they won't have a clue what you're talking about. We're so close to it, we think knowledge of it must be ubiquitous. It's not.

I would change the 3rd line from "one" to "at least one". Other than that, looks great.

If you have a purpose for buying them outside of pure speculation on their future value, then it's a no-brainer. Simply buy them and start using them in lieu of fiat.

It's a poor analogy. Esperanto does not solve a fundamental problem. Although there are something like 7,000 languages, the reality is that the vast majority of the planet speaks 4 of them so communication isn't really an issue. Also, the marginal value of Esperanto is difficult to measure - its mostly qualitative.
Bitcoin solves the fundamental problems of fiat currency and central banking, almost all of which are quantitative.

This is exactly what people think will happen with regard to hyperdeflation. "Wow, the purchasing power of this is going up so fast, I'd be a fool to spend it right now. I better hold onto it in case it keeps going up."
Then, without transactions, the market tanks. That's the theory anyway.

I feel your frustration. For me, it was a quick slide from mainstream statism to voluntaryism with only the briefest stop-off in Libertarianville. A large part of the reason is that political libertarianism is trying to play by the rules - campaign, get elected, try to change the system from "the inside". It's pure folly. The game is rigged. In the end, it's just another power grab.
Create the change you want to see in the world within your own life first. Bitcoin, while not necessarily the answer, is a means to achieving personal liberty. The progression of human history has been toward more individual liberty, not less. Change takes time. We'll get there eventually.

First, it's *especially*. "Specially" has a different meaning. Just letting you know in case you didn't, so don't hate.
To your point, the current sell-off and resultant panic has nothing to do with a lack of oversight or regulation. It has to do with educating yourself about investing. What we are witnessing is simply the market in action. People who buy into double-exponential growth curves are taking huge risks. People who are not cost-averaging are taking huge risks. People who are trying to "time the market" or who are buying BTC to make a quick buck are taking huge risks.
The market is self-regulating. Those who get burned by this current sell-off will learn a valuable lesson. Those who waited will get a massive dip to buy into and thereby profit.

Dear OP:
Do you have a mortgage or two on a house you own?
Do you have children and/or owe child support?
Do you have credit card debt?
Pay for utilities? Gas, electric, water, sewer, trash?
Have insurance payments to make?
Car payments? Gas?
Are you responsible for buying groceries?
In short, do you have any responsibilities right now for which that $1,000 would probably be better spent?
If not, then BUY SOME BITCOINS, CHILD!!! You could be a millionaire before you're 18^*.

I'm sorry, OP, but this kind of paternalistic bullshit is annoying. I wish people like you would stop telling others how they should use their bitcoins or what's best for the system. It's really none of your business. Stop telling people what "we" need to do. There is no we.
This, more than anything, is why I'm glad it's a decentralized system.

Perhaps, though it's important to recall that the EIC was granted their monopoly by royal charter - backed by the full force of the British empire. It's not like it evolved naturally.

@_date: 2013-04-01 04:24:41
The purpose of a currency is to facilitate trade. The value of bitcoins are inextricably tied to their utility as a currency. Without trade, bitcoins are worthless. 
Also, markets do not go up indefinitely. People want to buy things and when the price gets to a certain point, they sell the bitcoins to buy what they want.

Right now, the value of all Bitcoin in circulation sits 68th behind Serbia in M0. If Bitcoin increases in value 10X then it will become the 32nd largest currency (in terms of USD) in the world between the Hungarian forint and the Danish krone.
