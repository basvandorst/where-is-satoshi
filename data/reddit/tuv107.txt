I think in the long term it will go up, personally especially if you believe in what bitcoin is I wouldn't sell.

I don't know about any fork but coinbase will give you as much BCH as you had BTC on coinbase at the time of that fork on August 1st, what you did with your BTC after doesn't effect anything.

Probably not. The market is still young and in many's opinion if it does stop gowning it will be because it stabilized not because it crashed.

I think it's dangerous to take any advice on what will happen in the short term but nearly everyone here would say in the long run it will rise. 
It's going up pretty fast so you might not have the chance to buy at this price again but no one could tell you for sure.
Also coinbase is the best place to start buying bitcoin for beginners.

Put a dollar bill and the rest in bitcoin. He might think a dollar fiat is worth more the 10$ of btc, this way he can't feel cheated and happy that he got something extra.

Why? What's the harm of increasing block size in the mean time?

In this recent case all those coins were donated by a Chadette.

I remember reading that there's code to implement already in place to add another 8 decimal places if this becomes a problem.

Do something to deserve your coins.

Number of U.S. households powered for 1 day by the electricity consumed for a single transaction - 8.45. 
Is this true? That's crazy!

It actually seems like somewhere I might like. Thank you.

I think you're being emotional calling them traitors. Most of bch owners still want a decentralized currency and they think bch is better then btc for this. Do you think ETH holders are traitors as well?

I understand that much, but say for example there's 50 000 nodes that individual people run. But say 70% want to fork bitcoin and the other 30% don't. Theoretically could entities that have the resources that want the 70% to reach consensus run 20 000 extra nodes to get there?

I can't think of any example that would use katakana or hiragana right now but I'm sure there's words that have  ん in the middle of them. If spell out Kanto or bento in katakana or hiragana you'll have a ん in the middle of a word.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:24:24
I'm not trying to argue I'm telling you how I see it and I'm asking if it's the correct way of looking at it. See I didn't know that the nodes had to do work to be part of the consensus. To reiterate I'm not arguing for the sake of arguing I was genuinely trying to understand and maybe I was being a bit dense. But nevertheless thank you for your time and answers I didn't realize that the nodes had to do     work to mean anything.

The fee is a little prohibitive but it's the same no matter how much you spend so I usually wait to there is a big sale and buy like 10 things at once.

They were talking very favorably about it on coast to coast last night.

You're right though vowels could be one character and also funnily enough N can be. 
So bitcoin would be
The character before the ト means it repeats the first letter of the next character if ッ is small, if it's big it means tsu.

Ghost, politics and scam medication.

I could be wrong, and I'm asking to clear things up not to attack bitcoin but to understand it better. I want to see it succeed not only because I have a fair amount of it but because I think it's a more fair way to operate then by using fiat. But I thought when you run a node you could vote on upcoming forks. That's why I thought someone can run multiple nodes and vote multiple times. I just want to clarify that this isn't this case, and if it isn't by what means is a consensus tallied?

 " - " is used when there's a long vowel in katakana, in romanji you would see a line on top of a vowel . It's only used for vowels. Also the loan would try to get the same sound not the same spelling. So hall would become ホール which is Ho/o/ru there is no L sound in Japanese.

I hate Trudeau and I would rather the conservatives in, but the dollar started going to shit under a conservative government.
