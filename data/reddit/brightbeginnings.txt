Hello!  
Bright Beginnings for Kittitas County is a 501(c)3 nonprofit early learning center in Kittitas County, WA ( and we target poverty in our communities by engaging families with young children in building stronger foundations for their future.
BBFKC provides high quality, individualized intervention services for children under 5 including a Birth-3 program connecting children with physical and cognitive disabilities with special care service providers and in-home education for the parents to help their child better interact with the world they're growing up in. 
Kittitas County has experienced a drop in child care providers and capacity that significantly impacts access to child care for the residents of this rural county especially when taking into account approximately 72.2% children under 6 have all parents working and 1 in 6 of all children under 18 in Kittitas County live in poverty.
As the largest early learning provider in Kittitas County, these results make it clear BBFKC is a driving force in our community to provide early learning opportunities for its residents, and indicates BBFKC needs to adapt to the changing market by creating a plan to expand hours and number of children our programs can serve. 
Funds for expansion will help BBFKC break the cycle of poverty by providing more families in Kittitas County access to high quality early learning resources and will decrease the unemployment rate for families currently unable work due to lack of childcare.
We've applied through the website with detailed contact info. Thank you so much for the opportunity!
