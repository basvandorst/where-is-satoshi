Haha. Made sense to me.

I thought this was going to read something like this: "Bitcoin, taint like traditional money and it taint like traditional investments" or something along those lines.

I actually had a choice to either invest in gold or on bitcoin. Glad I chose bitcoin.

Should have started with "Hey idiot"

Any idea what will be discussed during this meet-up?  I'm definitely interested and may try to make it.

So the guy at 579-580 on the red side was trying to sell x amount of coins at that price?  I'm wondering why it stayed on so long.  Did he put up such a large amount that nobody was willing or capable of buying it or did he just not finalize the transaction until just now when the wall went away?

Is Justin Beiber getting deported?

Also terrorists have used shoes in the past.  We should also ban shoes.

So much truth in that gif I could feel it.

And... It's gone again.

I think we will have to pay $10 for every bitcoin we own so -$10 sounds about right.

On the bright side, its still better than where it was 24 hours ago.  Lets hope it stays that way.

I'd pay a bitcoin to punch that guy in the face.

As it was starting I was thinking to myself "how did I not know about this bitcoin commercial beforehand"?
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:21:41
It was nice while it lasted but I hope we never see 300 again. Onwards and upwards.

What does the 1000th comment get and can this comment be that?
