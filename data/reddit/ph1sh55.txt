A suicide hotline was a sticky post for a long time, so I will guess yes.

enough to cause the price to crash to where people thought it was worth less than 200 bucks.

Just because they didn't pursue that specific charge doesn't mean the instance didn't happen. 
There's a lot of fanboys in here that want to pretend this guy just ran a marketplace and are whitewashing claiming "that  never happened because he wasn't charged" which is a complete lack of understanding of our justice system. Go read the extensive accounts and logs of his actions and conversations and decide for yourself.

something something market crash, something something economic depression

a theory I heard put forth was that these institutions have been building very large long positions leading up to futures opening (which has helped fuel this insane run-up).  Once futures open they will purchase short futures contracts and liquidate their long positions to induce a crash.  They can basically make guaranteed money there, then they will buy it back up as panic carries the price down, rinse and repeat.  We'll see though, it should get real interesting over the next month.

Sounds like you may have a misunderstanding of how the market works.  For every buy or sell you need both a buyer and seller agree on a price for the coin/share etc.  This doesn't occur in a vacuum and buy and sell offers change all the time.  There's nothing that says the market would revert back to the 'original price' if someone sold what they just bought because it's entirely dependent on the offers that are out there at that moment in time (and they change constantly in response to price movement).
Say there's 5 sell offers at $1.00, 5 sell offers at $1.05, and 15 sell offers at $1.10.  The closest buy offer is $0.98, so right now there's no actual transaction occuring until the offers meet.  Until you decide to purchase a 'large quantity', lets say 20 units at 'market prices'.  To get 20 units of coin x you buy up all the units up to $1.10.  This becomes the updated market price on the ticker.  Now the dude who had a buy offer at $0.98 panics and wants to get in and tries to buy at $1.10.  Maybe the sellers seeing the momentum coming update what they are willing to sell (by using a limit order) and increase what they are willing to sell at.  More buyers jump in taking all the available sell offers so sell offers keep rising in price, which pushes the price up.  At some point the willing buyers run out at a certain price, and then more sellers will try to unload and have to start lowering their sell price to reach a buyer.  If you sell that 20 units later you could be selling into willing buyers at a higher price, meaning the price would not have to return to what it was when you first bought.
A 'whale' i.e. someone with a lot of capital or shares of the coin/stock etc can move the price to start the dominoes of momentum that smaller buyers and seller react to, and use this to their advantage to rebuy at better prices, or sell at higher prices.

Bad analogy is bad, a trading card is not an attempt at digital currency where functionality matters. See Myspace and AOL as immensely popular first movers that got surpassed by later businesses.

turbo tax premier has pretty good coverage on more complex stock/investment situations.  I had a year where I had a bunch of wash sales and it was a lifesaver for walking me through it all.  I use it every year for my ESPP situations as well..  You have a larger margin of error with bitcoins as well because there's no 'broker' sending tax information to the IRS on the other end....so seems like they kind of have to trust your data to an extent.

That money wasn't everything.  You have built it up to be, but it isn't.  As difficult as it may be right now...look at the bright side.  Your son is 5 years old! FIVE!  Do you know how many parents have started building up significant college funds for their children when they are 5 years old?  Not many.  You were way ahead of the game.  Many never even do.  Is that worth killing yourself over?  NO FREAKING WAY!  The most value you can give to your son is YOU, not money, and it's not even close.  If all you're passing on is money you have failed.  If your son would value the money more than you, you would have already failed at fatherhood.  In 13 years is college education going to even resemble what it does currently anyway?  The whole student loan cost of education skyrocketing can't continue...something has to give.  Barriers to higher learning are being broken down.
Take a step back because you are in a moment where you are lacking perspective.  You 'lost' (if it's completely lost) more than many ever see in their bank accounts.  You probably even have other assets.  You are still ahead of 50% of the 'middle class'.  People without immense material wealth are HAPPY all around you.  
Comparing a child having to pay through school with a child losing their dad is practically cringeworthy.  There is NO COMPARISON.  Maybe you have to hit your rock bottom to realize it, but it's the simple things in life that matter.

at the time you find the gold nugget it would have a fair market value which would be your starting point.  If that value then rockets up $1000/oz and you sell you would be taxed on the value 'gain' from when you first acquired the gold nugget.
edit: Actually I may not know what I'm talking about, it may be counted as income when you find it as well..

I'm not OP but here's an analogy: Look at a low volume stock.  If there is very low volume the price can jump around quite a bit due to lack of buyers and sellers meeting on an agreed upon price.  On the other hand a high volume stock many buyers and sellers are able to find agreeable prices- it is liquid.  
Price moves on a per transaction basis are smaller for a liquid stock.  Think of penny stocks vs stocks on the DOW, or small cap vs large cap.   A larger pool of buyers and sellers tends to stabilize price movements.  It doesn't mean volatility is impossible, but it tends to result in less volatility than a smaller pool of participants.
For BTC, If more companies start accepting it, it likely correlates with a larger market and more participants in BTC.  in BTC-USD terms there are a larger pool of buyers and sellers to meet on agreed upon prices which tends to increase price stability.

Stocks will never drop.  Because stocks are bought by people who have disposable income.  These people do not need to sell stocks to survive, so they never sell their stocks.  Which means stocks can never go down in value.
