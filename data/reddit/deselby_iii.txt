I wish they'd list the 17 predictions made by Krugman. Do you have the raw data?
Because Krugman's track record is a mess, from his prediction that the internet wouldn't have a meaningful impact on the economy, to praising the European model just before the Euro debt crisis, to saying Argentina (which just asked for assistance from the IMF) had a bright future ahead.
I suspect the study you cited has a strong liberal bias, but I'll try to keep an open mind.

Well, I don't think you're a shill as you're merely pointing out the fact that the current implementation is fatally flawed from a privacy and fungibility standpoint. 
It's not like you're making the claim that Bcash, with its fully transparent blockchain, can provide better anonymity than the LN, or anything of the sort.


I would like to understand how. On the Tor network you'd set up a bunch of nodes and launch frequent large-scale DDoS attacks on legitimate node operators as a way of re-routing traffic through your own malicious construct.
How would an attacker go about doing this on the LN? I mean, subvert the routing algo with a 90%+ rate of success.

Why use blockchain, though? It's not decentralized in the slightest.
@_date: 2018-05-18 14:02:10


Because that's how Satoshi programmed it. 
Also, because it doesn't lead to malinvestments into stocks and real state, because under a Bitcoin standard it would only make sense to invest in solid businesses capable of generating free cash flows.
2% inflation is a tax and leads to the misalocation of capital. Plus, wages don't always move in line with inflation, thus eroding the middle class' purchasing power.
The only valid criticism would be that under a Bitcoin standard people would stop taking loans. This would be a problem for small businesses, but one that could perhaps be overcome by a mechanism similar to Treasury Inflation Protected Treasuries, tracking inflation.

Historically, maybe. But the 8% average return is predicated on the idea of economic growth, which was much more easily obtained back then than it is now.
Consumers are tapped out as we enter the endgame phase of monopolistic consolidation by the likes of Amazon.
Stocks keep going up because of blatant market manipulation and price suppress in the PM market.
 I mean, the Bank of Japan OWNS 75% of the ETF market and a decent stake in a number of companies. 
The Fed does it too, through proxy vehicles like the Swiss National Bank. How's that a free market?

It's systemic. I mentioned a few examples, but there are others like high frequency trading and 'analyst' reports meant to deceive and manipulate retail muppets.


I can agree w/ that statement. Banks would have thought twice about taking insane amounts of risk if there wasn't implicit assurance they'd be bailed out.
Still makes them a bunch of sociopathic elitists with delusions of grandeur, willing to take advantaged of a dumbed down, financially illiterate public,though.


Perhaps. That's hard to quantify. The point is to create a system of incentives that's better than what we have now, and isn't
based on trust. 
Even if I were to accept your premise (which I wouldn't without rigorous data), it's fallacious to assume we have to put up with a corrupt system because, at some point in the past, it had the positive aspect of bringing prosperity to the middle class.

I didn't mention socialism directly, although I referred to a number of social policies  usually defended by proponents of socialism.
Now, as for the relationship between universal health care, SS and 'free' college and gun rights is the basic dictotomy between individualism on the on side, and the notion that the government knows what's best for its citizens.
So there's almost perfect overlap. I believe in the right to speak my mind (1st amendment), the right to defend my property and protect myself from government thugs trying to suppress my right to free speech (2nd amendment), the  right to manage my finances (SS, health care, inflation, Bitcoin, etc), and generally the right to be left the fuck alone.

You could argue, and I would agree w/ you, that the failsafe is the Federal Government stepping in to prop up failing banks w/ taxpayer money.

I see. Do you think this will change as the network topology becomes more expansive and decentralized? Tor itself only has something like 8,000 relays and exit nodes. LN will likely have millions of channels open between hundreds of thousands of users across the globe.
Also, wouldn't a form of 'churning' help out w/ plausible deniability? In Monero, for example, you can send funds multiple times between wallets under your control to increase the anonymity set exponentially.
An intermediary node might be able to deduct who its predecessor was once if there's only one viable routing option, but over 10 txs the link should effectively be broken.
I do agree user profiling will be a problem, just like browsing fingerprinting for Tor users before.

Your argument is flawed for two reasons:
a) The expert problem/fallacy. Empirical evidence suggests the econ. profession is devoid of skill. Unlike a dentist, a lawyer or a professional translator, economists and central planners have no 'skin in the game' and an abysmal track record. 
Greenspan and Bernanke come to mind as two highly educated intellectuals who were completely wrong on everything. 
Although, at least in the case of Greeenspan, he knew the theories he was spouting were nonsense, but just went along with it for financial gain.
b) It excludes the possibility of collusion, which is ludicrous since banks have been caught manipulating the LIBOR rate, jawboning precious metals and selling crud in the form of MBS and CDS derivative products.
In fact, the government was complicit in the whole sub-prime fiasco, by actively encouraging home ownership and reassuring investors real estate bubbles could only be regional.

As it stands, large corporations will use talent capable of developing the technology to automate most tasks and keep everything for themselves. 
Once that race is won, you'll see an absolute concentration of resources to the detriment of everyone else. At that point they don't need care about the unwashed masses anymore, as they're no longer needed to produce things and consume their products.

But these are just people doing their jobs. Jeff Bezos of Amazon is a tyrant. 
As for banks, you're right. They're evil. I think they serve a purpose, to a degree, though. It's not my style, but I'd be okay w/ banks if they
took deposits and upheld responsible lending practices. 
It's not going to happen, of course.
And besides, who's to say a Bitcoin Standard would work? I like to think it would, but the whole system is built on debt and growth projections.
Pension funds require 6% to 7% annual growth in perpetuity to stay afloat. If you don't prop up the market w/ debt it all comes crashing down. Billions of people empoverished overnight. 
We'd really have to build a Citadel to protect ourselves from the social unrest.

The government claims Cazes used his personal hotmail account in an automated message sent to newly registered users on the site.
He knew about Ross and the Silk Road, so do you really think he'd be that careless? I have a hard time believing that.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:05:13
I think the government used a zero day to take over AB and nab Cazes. 
Which is what I suspect happened w/ the Silk Road, after which they planted fake evidence in Ross' laptop.
And I don't mean some milquetoast exploit only targeting Windows machines with Javascript enabled like they did during the Freedom Hosting incident.

Hmm, that sounds too dystopian for my taste. I know you meant a decentralized, encrypted login, but that still poses a security threat, especially when you throw corporations like Microsoft into the mix.
Also Lyft and Uber sound great on the surface, but when you dig deeper into their operations you see Uber employees barely make enough to pay for the depreciation costs associated with driving people around in their vehicles. I'd imagine Lyft does the same thing. 
Banks have a history of rackteering, so they're fair game in my view, but cabbies are hard working people whose livelihood is being destroyed by the new 'gig' economy. And it's not like working conditions are any better for those working for Uber/Lyft. 
AirBnB is probably better, but we want to avoid giving any one corporation monopoly-status. It could work with a decentralized, open-sourced platform, but let's not take it too far.

What the fuck does that even mean? The blockchain is as transparent a medium for transaction as one can conceivably exist.
Even if you manage to launder you BTC, you'll  still have to game the legacy banking system through the use of cash mules, ratholes and transfer pricing schemes. It's not a problem unique to BTC.

Interest is waning because the price is down, just like in 2014. Meanwhile real research is being made, and when LN is fully operational and BTC can be used for transactions, and Hedgies and Central Banks finish accumulating their stacks, the search volume will go up as the norms rush back in.

Yes, there's one from January 2017 for Bitcoin (slightly less bullish but still predicting $100k by 2024) and one from February 2018, which predicts the total marketcap for all the cryptos will reach $50 Trillion by around 2028.
I'm on my phone and too lazy to perform a search, but you can just google 'trolololo Bitcoin price logarithm Bitcointalk' and you'll find the latest forum thread with the revised chart.

That's the 1000 BTC question. If Satoshi was Hal Finney working w/ Nick Szabo, then I don't think they'll ever move, at least not for a couple hundred of years.
One thing that has always terrified is the possibility Satoshi was the NSA. I don't entertain that thought often, only when I'm severely depressed, but everything's possible. If that's indeed the case, we'll find out soon enough.
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:25:41
I dunno, but I'd be willing to finance that little trading operation of yours. $10 for a $500 drop - I'll have more BTC shorting the market than Roger Ver!

Roger Ver has his faults, but he was right in telling these dipshits they don't understand Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:50:50
So the fucktard didn't start offloading in September, he admits the sale of BTC and BCH took place between December and February.
Kobayashi is full of shit. This was blatant market manipulation. He's not dealing w/ the garden variety brainwashed slaved trained to worship at the altar of collectivism found in Japan. 
We know you're a piece of shit Nobuaki!
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:10:45
It's that kind of elitism that caused this split in the first place. I have my own issues w/ BCH, but I can totally understand Roger Ver's frustration with the way the Core team runs things. 
Ver and Vorhees own businesses that process tens of thousands of transactions each day, i.e., the lifeblood of the network. Saying their opinion shouldn't be heard is myopic nerd-think at its worst.
Criticize Roger for not disavowing Faux Satoshi's preposterous claims, and for associating w/ Jihan and McAffe, not for his frustration w/ high fees.
By the way, Richard Heart is a scammer w/ a shady past and a hypocrite. He shits on Ethereum (rightfully so, mind you) but has the gall to launch his Computational Fluid Dynamics Token on their network. He's just another pump and dumper looking to make a quick buck.

The report mentioned that the trustee took all possible steps to maximize value for claimants, so it's obvious Kobayashi is aware of his duty to investors.
The problem is that he's a fuck face bureaucrat operating under a blatant bias against BTC. The timing for the sale was shit and completely intentional. 
The FBI are scum for stealing Ross's money, but at least they had the decency to do it in an open auction.
Not to mention the fact that proponents of a decentralized currency went crying to the goverment the minute they realize their trust in a lard ass, socially inept Frenchman w/ an escort addiction was misplaced. Fucking pathetic.
Wences Cezares warned people to buy BTC on Mt.Gox but to withdraw to a wallet the moment the transaction went through. Other people could have done the same. No need to get the nanny state involved.

If he found a way to make BCH more private than BTC, then I might see some merit in Roger's argument.
Can we really expect any innovation from the Bitcoin Cash side? Do they even have a real development team? 
Implement CoinJoin transactions by default to take advantage of the low fees, and hire someone to do research on Schnorr so BCH can have that ahead of Bitcoin.  Anything!

I don't know about George Marechal's work to make a judgement, but for stock prices the statistical evidence suggests a limited number of factors like earnings information (which is nearly impossible to predict ahead of time and with any degree of consistency) and exogenous factors (M&amp;As, wars, terrorist attacks,etc) account for the bulk of price action. Consistely delivering alpha then becomes a near statistical impossibility.
In the case of Bitcoin, the log returns follow a Levy-Stable distribution with infinite variance.
How on earth is TA supposed to work with a probability density function that wild? 
Plus, why would Tone Vays make any of his predictions public when he could simply trade on his calls and make a killing? Given a decent sample size of profitable trades I'm sure he'd have no trouble raising enough capital to start his own hedge fund.
The fact he chooses not to take that route seems indicative of the fact his 'insights' are mostly noise w/o any predictive ability.

Given the choice, I'd take Trump over Hillary any day of the week. Doesn't mean I'm a 'Trump supporter', though. 
I can give you a laundry list of things he's done wrong, from the omnibus bill to Syria, to pretty much everyone he's ever appointed to his cabinet.
Perhaps I worded my response imprecisely, but he had more engaged supporters and won more states, whereas Mrs. Clinton was the 'safe' candidate and therefore had a lot of people's vote by default. 
Plus all the major media outlets were prophesizing she'd win. It was a relentless media campaign. If anything, wouldn't it be fair to say the DNC colluded w/ the media to influence the election? 
As for Wikileaks, I did read your comment. If you agree the content is legitimate, then what's the issue? The American public didn't like reading about pedo Weiner and Podesta the freak and voted accordingly. Maybe not the people in CA and NY, but she knew the rules: you have to win the electoral college.

Oh, they know what it is. Maybe not the stooges in congress, but they know it's something that left unregulated would threaten the status quo, so they'll do every thing in their power to regulate it into oblivion.
The puppet masters at the top do all the thinking for bumbling buffoons you see on TV, like Schumer and Pelosi. The elites have been doing this for hundreds of years. They have the experience, the intelligence, privileged access to information, and unlimited resources.

It is a tad puritanical, for sure. But if a lot of people started doing just that, i.e., living on BTC and BTC alone, adoption would spread pretty damn fast. 
Problem for me is finding a supermarket/convenience store chain. I suppose you could order from Amazon, but a) I don't want to associate w/ that company and their monopolistic, creepy stalker, control-freakish ways and b) I believe true adoption involves native support at the Point-of-Sale level.

You're just trolling, right? The 5% figure you mentioned refers to the programatically defined expansion of the money supply, while the 3% inflation metric represents a measure of price inflation as reflected by the CPI.
So no, you're wrong. The purchasing power of 1 BTC has increased 7-fold YoY, while the PP of the US dollar has DECREASED during the same period. 
Similarly, the Fed continues to expand the monetary supply at a rate greater than 5% per year. After 2020, monetary inflation will go down to 2.5% for BTC, and 1.25% by 2024. By 2028, we'll be looking at .625, .31, .15% and so forth, whereas the Fed will simply continue to debase the currency of the United States like it has been doing for the past 105 years.

I wouldn't be surprised if the bulk of the money came from paid ICO sponsorships. And I seriously doubt he ever made $4 M.
Even the whole thing about working at IBM seems suspect to me. I've watched a number of his videos and he has admitted on multiple occasions that he cannot read code, at least code pertaining to cryptocurrency projects.

I'd hate to see BTC used for something like Alexa. It's amazing the lengths people will go to be enslaved by evil corporations like Amazon or Google.
Cars don't need to be fitted with Alexa. Just open the damn window and scan the QR code.

This NOT good news. ML for Columbian drug cartels is a-okay when your HSBC, but it's a big no-no when it involves crypto.
Seriously, though, what the fuck have Phil Potter et al. gotten themselves into? Counterfeiting, fractional reserve trading, money launderimng...there's no way they won't end up in jail.

Exactly. Quality is shit nowadays for pretty much anything other than consumer electronics.
Especially for food, like ready-made meals and such. I've been told they don't even use real chicken anymore, only edible plastics with fake grill marks.
