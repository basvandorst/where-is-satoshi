The difference in this is that the money you borrow from the bank is very real money that you have to pay back to that bank at an interest. Whilst the money that is lent to you was not ever even owned by that bank and is given to it for free. 
Now one could argue: But they they are legally responsible to pay that money back...
Well as seen in the last financial crisis, they are as long as they can't. And when this zero sum feedback loop of 0% interest loans that is lent out and repackaged in other shady finacial products collapses. The very real tax money that all of us don't have because we support our societies is then given to these banks that were taking advantage of a "rigged" system. All without asking us...
This is what is exorbitantly insane. That financial institutions are allowed to play and fuck around with money they don't even have and make more of it. Creating hyperinflated bubbles of nothingness.
Credit is a needed thing in our societies to exchange future energy to build something today. That's fair enough, yet when this is a privilige given only to a select few that act behind closed doors at their own discretion to increase personal wealth as opposed to the collective benefit and growth. It is more than fucked up - it is literally deranged!
The state of the finacial system being as it is today does not mean that it makes any sense at all. 
Not saying that crypto will solve all of it at once but it is a step in the right direction. As long as we are living in authocratic and oligarchic pseudo democracies it is all going to be a challenge.
With a growth in human consciousness and societal evolution we might be able to tackle these things on a more fundamental and personal level. Where individuals might understand that having multiple millions or billions to their disposal is actually not making them happy or bettering the world in any way.
