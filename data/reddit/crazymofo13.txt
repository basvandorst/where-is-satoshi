try and bait him to get proof.  Approach him with an offer to buy a small amount bitcoins.  Make sure you transfer to his bank account and track the coins in the blockchain.  If they are the same coins he will have some explaining to do.

Try and trick him into selling you some of the stolen bitcoin.  Make sure you pay into his personal account and take screenshots of everything.  That way you know for sure who it is.  They will have some explaining to do.  If you have all the evidence maybe the police will help.

Its a new tech.  They will not have the staff that know what to do properly and probably dont know what to write in the accounts.   I would advise only small transactions until companys know what they are doing. Especially big companys.

If anyone is interested I will look after their private keys for them.  :)

Bitcoin will be around forever but I dont think it will be the long term global front runner.  Only thing Bitcoin has got thats good is the well known name and its accepted in a few places.  There are better cryptos so it would make sense that the better ones will eventually take over.

Yes.  The downfall of anonamous trading is that there is a lot of fake trades.  Its the wild west out there

Price of coins is missing the point entirely. Wannabe day traders thinking they are gordon gekko ha ha.  Blockchain is here to stay. But in what form?  Very doubtful it will be the first blockchain (bitcoin).  In fact thats pretty crazy to think the first blockchain would get it right.  Kind of like thinking the internet would never evolve past AOL chat on a 3k modem.   I can see bitcoin being around forever in the back ground by geeks but it will not be the fine tuned crypto that will eventually make keeping track of money a whole lot more efficient.   The possibilities are endless

Imagine this.  Crowd funded hostage releases.  If the bad guys don't get the money they want from the authoritys then they can put out a hostage video online and say we want this much money in bitcoins or the bunny gets it.   Then no matter how much the authority says we do not give in to terrorists people on the internet would end up paying the ransoms.

Blockchain tech might oneday be the norm but bitcoin most certainly will not.
