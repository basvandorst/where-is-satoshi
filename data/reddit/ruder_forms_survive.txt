In my opinion 2+2=37.

Where did the bank get the money that they loaned you for your house from?

Hmm, so I should buy cryptocurrencies when people use childish language rather than rational argument to attack them...

Not if you actually know the history of why that sub was created.

r/btc was created long before Bitcoin Cash existed. It was created because discussing hardforks was considered to be altcoin discussion on this forum (and disallowed).

Sounds to me like inflation encourages unnecessary spending which could lead to depletion of resources and, oh I don't know, a global climate crisis of some sort?

So basically governments are different from households because under our system we require households to operate responsibly and we don't require the same of governments?
Kind of the point of the OP isn't it?

A post about bitcoin cash about how we don't pay attention to bitcoin cash. Paradoxical, no?

Cold storage.

The fact that you have to point this out means we're really starting to reach Eternal September on these forums.

Inflation can be an effective tool for transferring wealth from average working people to the rich.

The US money supply is controlled by private institutions like the federal reserve (and other private banks creating money through fractional reserve banking), not the government.
You have zero democratic representation with regard to these organizations.

There are more than 20 empty houses to every one homeless person in the us.
People just sit on property because they know it's a better store of value than a currency designed to lose value.

Even if that is true (it is partially, but it also ignores the fact that many of those types of mental illnesses are "diseases of civilization" only found within our current form of capitalism), the fact that there are so many houses going to waste should tip you off that there's some systemic artificial scarcity going on. Hell the entire concept of land ownership completely fails to stand up to the internal logic of modern ethics anyway. Follow the deed back far enough and someone got murdered for that land.

Inflation is evil.
You remember the huge tax increase gw bush instituted to pay for his absurdly expensive perpetual war?
Me neither.
You pay for that by inflation.

Yes. Not free money. Taking your own money back from those who have stolen it.
In our current system you have to work for money. Someone else gets to print it out of thin air. If you did that it would be called counterfeiting and you'd go to prison. A bank does it and it's the status quo.

Are altcoin posts telling people to use litecoin for small transactions when fees are high still allowed?

Maybe he loves BTC, but knows that it needs a fire under it's ass to actually get the tech scaled so as to be workable as a global currency.
BCH can be the impetus for working BTC scaling solutions to be created.

Cause the collective insecurity of this forum is showing?
