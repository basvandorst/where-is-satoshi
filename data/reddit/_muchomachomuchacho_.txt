I made the mistake of not realizing it was a gallery with image descriptions on imgur. If you just looked at the first image and didn't read the description, I can understand how you'd come to that conclusion.

For anybody who does know what this means, it basically means when they make changes to the code of their website they don't put it on a test server and test it first. They put it live right away on the website. 
When you make changes to code no matter how trivial they are it's always best practice to test them on a "test server" before going live because a small mistake can break many things causing lots of problems.
The fact that they have a bitcoin exchange without testing all changes before going live is... well, [insane](

I would suggest you make an extensive post on the legalities of Bitcoin and publish it for free. You'll gain notoriety and establish credibility. If you want help in setting up a website, I would be willing to help you at no cost. 
For the record I think if you didn't care about anonymity you could simply setup shop without giving anything away for free. I only suggest the idea of setting up a website/giving out free information to establish yourself and ease concerns.

Buy as much as you can right now. Tomorrow at 2:34pm sell all of it. Once the crash hits its lowest point at 9:13pm on Tuesday evening, buy back as much as you can afford. You're welcome.
