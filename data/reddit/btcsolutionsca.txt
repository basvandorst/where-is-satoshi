The regulations are a bit different in Canada. This is totally legal and accepted my our banking partners. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 16:13:23
Thanks for the differentiation! We are a Canadian based brokerage and ATM company. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:43:53
Know a good lawyer?
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:34:26
We tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. Over and over... ATM's are great! You need a killer location and a love for Bitcoin... And not buy it from robocoin!! That ROI is terrible 
@_date: 2015-06-19 04:31:35
I'm sure we could. Will have to look into it. Was hoping to get this done without lawyers... but I guess he wants to get them involved. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:07:59
Their software game has increased.. He had been using our money to pay for it!

Would love to hear your questions and comments. We are doing and AUA (ask us anything) at 11 am. Obviously the story is written by us but the emails and messages are all there. But please. Ask away.

Still going to get this published? I have reached out 3 times to Jordan with no response.
@_date: 2015-06-26 06:22:06
The process is:
- request Bitcoin via  (no need for secure HTTPS link as it is merely a contact form)
- we get back with your quote and account details to drop cash into the bank
- once deposited, we verify and send bitcoin to the address specified in the original contact request form. 
Visit  or email us for more info!
@_date: 2015-06-19 02:14:12
Everyone's support is greatly appreciated! After reaching out to Jordan, we have still not heard back! Unbelievable. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:41:50
Anyone think he will have the decency to respond?
@_date: 2015-06-18 17:34:57
STILL haven't heard from Jordan or the team at Robocoin. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:46:02
Your absolutely right. 
I wasn't comparing Bitcoin to Company Z. I am comparing Bitcoin to the stock market with day trading. Shares are a great long term investment. They are (relatively) safe, you can be excited and grow with the company. Dividends are outstanding. It is also (99% of the time) slow earnings. 
If you day trade Bitcoin you can make 30% in a day if you use the right tools (8x leverage with good timing on the market). Those are great!!
@_date: 2014-10-08 14:51:22
YVR would be great! They have made it clear that their doors are quite closed, however. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 05:16:15
We were all green at one point! Let us know if you check it out and have any questions! You can test the waters with $10! If you make an account with sign up code rdit I will connect with you personally and help you out... Even get you up and running with your first $10!

Glad to see new comers to the space!

Great idea! You can trade with as little as $10! Go give it a shot! Let us know what you think at trading
@_date: 2014-10-08 15:27:43
Great thoughts and points! Thank you very much! Check out the BitcoinCA page/post here 
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:17:03
Which do you think Will we see yearly lows or $1000/coin?
@_date: 2014-10-08 16:28:00
Bitcoin is so much more than the price! It is a payment network. If PayPal's stock price drops it doesn't make PayPal less valuable. It makes its current, short term value for investors weaker. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 14:53:58
Struggle is most airports are unwilling to hear out the opportunity of a Bitcoin ATM. It is a miracle we got in with YXX! Was thinking maybe the publicity from North America's first Bitcoin ATM being in an airport would stimulate the community.
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:21:04
Do you think the volatility of Bitcoin opens up for serious day trading potential? There are a number of avenues people can leverage and hop in and out of positions numerous times/day and profit accordingly. 
Your right, big money won't invest - but the market volatility to anyone with some charting researching background could seriously profit! Don't you agree?
@_date: 2014-10-06 02:33:16
Short it with 8x leverage. Put your money where your mouth is spookthesunset. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:51:03
Hey LIpigpenLI we are the same way! If you are constantly watching the price are you day trading too? Not to push a product but if you want to make money on the small moves in the market fire us an email info or check out btcsolutions.ca/online-trading and let us know if you have any questions. 
PS we are definitely on the same boat of checking the price all the time!! Glad to see everyone commenting!! Cheers!

Bitcoin shouldn't be bought and held to used if being used as currency. It should be bought on an as needed basis to use for purchasing.
If people didn't use their stored, held Bitcoin to purchase stuff and took the cash they were going to use to purchase it, put it into Bitcoin and then bought it the price fluctuations wouldn't be an issue. They could benefit from all of Bitcoin's strengths and not suffer from it's only variable.  
@_date: 2014-10-08 15:26:34
Ah - your from the US. Canadian's don't have a Coinbase. But fair enough. Thank you for your feedback!
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:26:50
Long term, very nice!
@_date: 2014-10-08 14:57:33
It looks like you say this from the standpoint of a person who does not use Bitcoin now. If there was only one airport in BC that had a restaurant would you fly through that airport? Or just pick whichever was cheapest?
@_date: 2014-10-27 16:35:27
As mentioned by quadrigacx you can see our ATM's at

Different jurisdiction. Same problem!
@_date: 2014-10-25 11:12:39
Thanks for your feedback. We appreciate it! The rates page is displayed to show the scaled leverage and unfortunately has to be the way it is to get the information across! 
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:20:11
Totally agree! 
Adam here - personally I am stock piling! Opening up long positions with max leverage will come next week after we see some indicators I think! What does  think?

@_date: 2014-10-30 17:59:52
Actually, no! We put up the 8x. If you invest $100 we give you $700 - giving you 8x more! We have a stop/loss system set in place so your position gets closed out automatically should the position go the wrong way and remaining funds (usually 30% of your initial investment) is deposited back into your account and ready to reinvest! There is, absolutely, risk involved. But we have created an excellent, no margin call, maximum leverage system allowing users to profit 8x more without having to risk 8x more!
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:14:08
Thank you! Edited!

Matches the app! Consistency! Nice work!

That is basically the only reason we are in the door. He doesn't want it there unless the airport traffic will use it, though. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 11:05:54
Thanks for your input! Why do you say that? You can take out as little as 2 and as much as 8. Users have a ton of flexibility with our trading products. Check them out! 
@_date: 2014-10-08 23:54:48
That's true. But $100 limited counted doesn't really do any good...

I think this is an excellent question!
No doubt banks are helping people move money. They have been for years. Further to that the dollar is way more stable. The value Bitcoin holds is in its speed and "borderless" nature. An added bonus to using Bitcoin to transfer money is the low (if any) transaction fees. 
Typically to transfer money through the banking system you are confined to your region. Otherwise you have to pay a fee to convert to foreign currency (if they will let you transfer in the first place) that is where Bitcoin's true advantage is. It is like transferring gold (or something else with world wide value) instantly and for free! Much like sending an email or text (or reddit post) compared to letter mail or hand delivering. 
Hopefully that clears things up somewhat. If you have any questions please let us know! We are pretty active and want to help spread Bitcoin knowledge! 
Great questions! Keep asking those!

Demand. Every time you fly ask where the Bitcoin ATM is. Be outraged they don't have one. Ask all the shops to use BTC..
It will take time.

Online exchanges (3-5 Business days for account funding) or personal brokers and ATMs offered by companies like ours.

Thanks a bunch! We appreciate the love!

Great points! I reckon the halving will play a massive role in monetary value indefinitely! Seems like a no brainer - the miner's costs essentially double!

No, I wasn't commenting on the ETF. I was commenting on 
"and people that buy stocks generally don;t buy things that don;t produce money."
Bitcoin can product money, via day trading.

The fee charged is the cost of not having to trust an exchange and having instant access to btc
Same reason most people pay thousands in interest for a house every year... The alternative is non existent. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 03:58:05
That's because the bank is happy holding your money and charging you a monthly fee 
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:12:16
Love it! 
Are you using a system to accept? Or just a mobile wallet?
We made a free software that you can use to accept btc, ltc, bch where you control the address and it spits out a nice report when needed

The thread was deleted. Reddit doesn't like the idea of "public shame"

That is strange. And very dodgy. The most recent one shown on their email blast is in Las Vegas. Anyone confirm?

Hey! Thanks for the comment. 
I'm thinking he will go bankrupt as no company with this kind of CEO can thrive. It just doesn't work in the world. 
Fire him a tezt and encourage him to pay us back! Would be greatly appreciated!

We had the same thought. 
On some other models (where software permits) we actually built this warning into the UI and shut the machine down for 1 minute if we think the user is a victim of fraud
Edit: for clarification we are the owners of this particular bitcoin machine

This one is at remedy Cafe in Southgate mall
@_date: 2019-04-16 13:43:40
We met with the police several times to come to this conclusion. The official police notice made it more official for the victims and it was agreed upon that this was the best step. 
However, we had no real say in the design or spelling (obviously...)
These signs get revisited every six months and we are excited to have them revised
@_date: 2019-12-12 22:54:57
You never know if there is private key behind the coin under that duct tape.

Where are you located? If you are in Canada we can sell you the BTC
@_date: 2015-10-08 18:14:27
What are you doing with the "buy bitcoins" button? Could we discuss something?
