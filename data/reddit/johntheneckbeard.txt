That's a serious risk my friend. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 13:48:01
His ass. Like most of his claims here. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 19:32:20
This is your 5th topic about it? 
You are now simply spamming/trolling and the mods should do something about it. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 12:30:43
So you deleted your comment. I take it then you have nothing to back up your claims?
Just another case of i love drugs and Bitcoin so Ross is innocent? What a surprise. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 16:25:26
Yes we know. Just like 90% of the posts here yours is a repost. Why is it so amazingly hard for you people to stop doing this?
@_date: 2014-09-16 12:27:20
Ok, we've had about 10 topics about this now and it's getting really ridiculous. 
No, Scotland is not gonna make Bitcoin its official currency. exactly 0% chance this will happen. 
Now please stop. Topics like this are the reason why so many people don't take us seriously. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 22:02:38
Either up or down. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 19:16:54
Stop it man. It was posted 30 times already half a week ago. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 09:19:17
You're clueless. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 16:13:31
Wtf? How is this not general finance?
In that case no financial news ever is off topic and should be posted here. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 15:09:40
This has only been discussed 200 times before. 
Did you just think of this for the first time?
@_date: 2014-09-12 15:57:12
No thanks. I stay far away from people like you. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 07:56:18
Yes we know. Please stop the reposts. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 13:10:38
A style called stupidity?
@_date: 2014-09-15 19:48:02
This is a Bitcoin sub. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:25:35
This was already posted 10 times yesterday. What exactly does it take to stop the crazy amount of reposts here?
@_date: 2014-09-17 19:07:09
Yes we know. It was posted 15 times 2 days ago. 
Unless it's your first day how did you not notice the massive amounts of reposts here? And then when you post something don't you think maybe i should check for reposts first? When will you people learn?
@_date: 2014-09-14 13:37:11
Nobody knows. Anybody who says otherwise is lying. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:30:16
I come here for BITCOIN news. Why do you people fail to understand this simple concept?
@_date: 2014-09-12 22:41:20
Just like reading that "article".
@_date: 2014-09-16 09:20:38
Yes we know. Because it was posted many times already. Is it really so goddamn hard to stop reposting things here?
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:20:20
No. It has nothing to do with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 13:40:06
Your posts are getting more retarded by the day. From all the cultists here you are by far the worst. Just stop posting. This place is better off without people like you. You are the reason people make fun of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 12:01:24
At no point you noticed we speak English here?
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:26:50
The typical reply in each and everyone of these off topic posts. 
"If you can't see this or that then you must be blind"  
@_date: 2014-09-14 12:06:48
How much weed do you smoke daily?
@_date: 2014-09-16 19:48:51
I explained this before to you. ALL your posts are reposts. Each and every one of them. Why do you insist on keep on doing this? Just stop wasting your and our time and stop posting. 
Once again. All of your posts, every single time, are reposts. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 21:22:08
Either up or down. 
Not a single person here can tell you anything else. Why even bother asking. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 16:11:59
Not the video but your replies. You are not mentally stable. And very young most likely. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 12:00:19
This is getting ridiculous. Every day you post these Scotland articles here trying to create a circle jerk. Are you mentally challenged or what? What is wrong with you man? Scotland will NOT start using Bitcoin. I can guarantee you that. Just stop with these retarded posts every day. You idiot!
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:56:55
I noticed this is the newest trend here. Post off topic content and then add Bitcoin somewhere in the title or story. 
It's retarded. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 11:56:11
Damn, that post really makes you look retarded. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 12:33:35
Most likely yes. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 21:01:07
They don't care that it's an obvious fake. A lot of them prefer to live in Bitcoin fantasy land. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:09:10
Not gonna work. All these nice little group ideas never work. Give it up. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 06:38:48
The only post with real facts here and ofcourse downvoted. As usual. They hate facts and reality here. 
Every Bitcoiner is innocent and anyone who says anything else gets downvoted to oblivion. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 19:11:24
That Andrea person is an anarchist extremist. People like him or her are absolutely completely worthless. The best thing that could happen would be to put all those idiots on an island and let them create their anarchist utopia. 
We can all guess how that will end. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 22:01:30
Yes we know. Because 'surprise surprise' it has already been posted several times today. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 21:32:17
So what are you asking then. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 13:46:33
So basically you just posted a sensationalist title trying to get a nice circlejerk going against the evil Comcast. Am i right?
@_date: 2014-09-12 23:41:16
Not with a credit card. But let's just ignore that. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:11:52
@_date: 2014-09-16 13:00:14
Complete waste of time. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:20:27
The off topic news is getting a real problem here. It's getting ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-09-11 18:26:44
Amazing how you know what the right price. 
Since you have this info why even bother asking us?
@_date: 2014-09-15 16:03:27
Is this the newest trend or what? Posting off topic news and then find a way to put Bitcoin in the title. It really is completely retarded and i see it more and more. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 18:57:58
Can you just stop posting off topic financial news?? You're getting real annoying. 
This is a Bitcoin sub! 
@_date: 2014-09-17 15:24:54
Amazing how many people here can look into the future. This sub is such a special place. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 12:31:07
Just stop man. This was posted 20 times 2 days ago. Can you just stop posting completely. You are like the village idiot in this sub. 
Idiots like you are the reason people make fun of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 12:29:57
Thanks for repeating last week's news. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:35:20
You don't have to explain to me what Bitcoin is you idiot. I own more than most people here. Still i don't care about off topic news that are created to start a circle jerk. 
Actually that must be the problem. These circle jerk posts get upvoted by broke kids with 1 or 2 coins. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 22:37:16
Your site is one of the dumbest Bitcoin sites that get spammed here. Pure garbage. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:16:15
He doesn't care. He is already looking for the next off topic financial article to post here. 
He is a dumb stoner kid who hopes the financial market will implode so his 2 coins might get worth more. 
He hopes to speed up that process by posting nonsense here all day long. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:55:02
If only you could understand how ironic this post it. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:03:02
And another off topic post by the biggest cultist in this sub. 
All day long all he does is post random financial news in order to create a Bitcoin circle jerk. 
When are the mods gonna do something about this?
@_date: 2014-09-15 13:32:20
The off topic news and made up titles here gets more idiotic by the day. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:09:24
Ffs man, can you stop posting random financial news! You annoying idiot!
@_date: 2014-09-16 12:00:37
Can you explain to me what's fake about it?
@_date: 2014-09-13 19:42:57
And another retarded made up story to create a Bitcoin circle jerk. The stuff people do here to try and make the 2 coins they own worth more is just crazy. 
@_date: 2014-09-11 00:02:16
Please man. It's been top news for the last 2 days and posted about 75 times already. Did you really think you are the first to post this?
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:56:00
Yes. It's already been discussed. A repost. Who would've guessed. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 11:53:23
Unless you like throwing away money why would you possibly do this?
@_date: 2014-09-15 13:40:03
You sound very butthurt. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 15:47:26
As i said if you could only understand it. Poor kid. 
Here's a hint. Take a guess who is looking crazy in this conversation. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 19:41:38
Yes we know! Please just stop. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 11:54:40
Now i'm supposed to pull down my pants and start jerking it while screaming BITCOIN USER NOT AFFECTED!!11, right?
Or is there another reason why you created this post?
@_date: 2014-09-16 15:29:00
Stop it man. Please just stop it. It's getting really ridiculous now. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 11:44:59
Nice title....if you like sensationalist nonsense. Which ofcourse they do here.  
@_date: 2014-09-17 00:07:02
Because i'm annoying as fuck but also make sense. 
In the first 30 minutes my posts get downvoted simply because of "oh, it's that guy again. Imma downvote him". Then the next batch of readers are like "he might be annoying but he's right". And they upvote me. 
I noticed this because when i start a new nick i mainly get upvotes because people don't recognize my name and aren't annoyed by me yet. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 14:25:36
News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 18:43:56
It was already posted before today. Why is this so hard to understand?
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:24:18
No, has nothing to do with the article. Isn't mentioned anywhere. 
You simply take a random article, added some made up stuff to it and hope to create a Bitcoin circle jerk. 
We're getting close to the point where people are just gonna make up random shit to submit here. It's getting more stupid by the day. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:03:40
I understand why outsiders call it a ponzi. 
I highly doubt you care about other people's children. 
I think you only care about the 2 coins you own and you need others to make it worth more. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 15:00:37
Yes we know. Because it was already posted 15 times 3 days ago. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 11:43:54
Please stop it. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:15:53
Blah blah. 
Yes it's off topic. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 18:59:48
Ok this shit is not only getting annoying but also completely retarded. 10 topics a day asking if Scotland will start using Bitcoin and now simply claiming they will. 
There is ZERO chance they will. Zero!!
Just stop it you idiots!
@_date: 2014-09-11 18:25:36
Yes, we know. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:06:21
Just stop posting financial news all day here man. You people always find a reason why it belongs here. In the meantime this sub is flooded with random financial news. News that serves one purpose only and that is to create a childish Bitcoin circle jerk. 
Why is it so hard to just post Bitcoin news here and financial news somewhere else. Do you realize most people come here for Bitcoin news?
I have a question for you which i hope you will answer. Why do you think the mods made a rule that says that financial news doesn't belong here?
@_date: 2014-09-14 12:56:16
Doesn't it bother you that you type like a 12 year old? Don't you want to be taken seriously in life? How old are you?
@_date: 2014-09-13 10:41:59
Such an original topic. Highly controversial. First time i see this. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 17:24:32
You are here all the time. You must have noticed the insane amounts of reposts here every day. Why do you do the same thing?
What does it take for you people to stop reposting stuff?
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:31:05
It's really simple. why put your money in something that gets worth less by the day. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 11:41:20
Can these idiots stop calling it a Bitcoin exchange?
@_date: 2014-09-14 12:03:35
I sure hope you're not older than 15. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 15:00:48
Yes we know. It was posted many times yesterday already. Why is it so goddamn extremely hard not to repost everything 10 times??
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:59:50
HOLY FUCKING SHIT! BITCOIN USER NOT AFFECTED!!!1!
I'm gonna stroke it till i'm sore!
@_date: 2014-09-16 13:34:10
This has been answered at least 200 or 300 times here already. But just don't use the search and ask it again. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 22:16:17
For the love of God, please just stop posting! How many times do i need to explain it to you?? EVERYTHING you post has already been posted. Usually a day earlier. Everyfuckingthing! Every post you make is old news!
Why do you just go on? Why?
@_date: 2014-09-15 15:15:33
I take it you sold your house, car and everything else you own and put it in Bitcoin. Anything else in your case would make you a hypocrite. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 11:48:52
Dates, facts and reality mean nothing here. The only thing that counts is creating nice Bitcoin circle jerk at least once a day. No matter how. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 21:59:17
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:01:34
Life is so easy when you're 16. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:18:34
Me too. People absolutely hate reality here. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 12:08:04
No please, tell me what exactly is fake about it. With some sources to back up your claims ofcourse. 
Also falsely convicted. What does that mean?
@_date: 2014-09-14 13:37:20
@_date: 2014-09-15 22:43:55
Wrong sub. 
Please stop. This sub is turning in a random financial sub. It's getting stupid. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 19:23:08
Great. Thanks to you he will go to jail for 12 years. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 12:28:40
Any sane person would directly find 10 reasons why this won't happen. But as always a lot of people here live in fantasy land.  
@_date: 2014-09-12 23:44:41
So people who try to steal coins get their coins stolen. Nope, sorry, can't feel sorry for them. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 12:02:18
He is completely delusional. There are a lot of delusional people here but this guy is really completely detached from reality. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:54:23
Ah right, thanks. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 17:46:04
You really think you're the first to post yesterday's news? Use some common sense and stop the reposts man. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 15:04:28
Please, just stop posting off topic financial news here all day. It is really annoying for the majority of users who want to read about Bitcoin. If we want financial news we'd go to a financial sub. 
Besides that it's also just silly. These posts serve no other purpose than to try and create a Bitcoin circle jerk. Maybe we're mature enough now to stop doing this. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:20:56
Nope, not allowed to ask such questions. You got downvoted. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:51:26
Did you really think you are the first to post this??
@_date: 2014-09-14 14:14:00
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:22:50
I wonder how out of touch with reality one must be to think Scotland might start using Bitcoin. 
The fact that this is posted 3 times a day shows how many lunatics there are in this sub. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 14:00:11
Yes we know. You can stop posting about it. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 15:12:48
Every day 2 dozen people here post random financial news and then claim the rules don't apply to their post because it's relevant to Bitcoin. 
You can make pretty much anything relevant to Bitcoin. 
In the meantime me and 1000's of other users who simply want to read Bitcoin news have to browse through this shit all the time. 
If i want financial news i will go somewhere else. I come here for Bitcoin news. 
Why do you think the mods made that rule. Please answer this question. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 15:28:24
Stop smoking weed for a week. You will feel better and appear more sane. Really, try it. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:41:17
This has nothing to do with the goddamn article! Once again you posted random off topic news and added some of your own blah blah to create a circle jerk. It's pathetic as fuck!
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:56:00
Without reading all that i take it this is yet another sensationalist title?
@_date: 2014-09-14 11:57:23
And another retarded topic from the biggest idiot in this sub. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 12:58:53
Why the fuck would i want to watch that video? Stop obsessing with it man. You fucking freak. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 20:42:19
We know. We got it the first 10 times it was posted. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 13:35:15
What does your story have to do with Bitcoin??
@_date: 2014-09-14 13:08:57
Ok. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 13:43:30
Only on this sub will something negative be on top of the mainpage posted as something positive. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:29:37
Critical thinking is not the same as making up shit just to create a circle jerk. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:17:43
Tell me about it. Many people here can't handle it. And i think you are one of them funny enough. 
In the meantime i have no idea how your reply is relevant to my post. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 10:41:13
Yes we know! Please stop!
Edit: you are the same person who posted this 2 hours ago. Are you gonna repeat this all day or what?
@_date: 2014-09-16 15:51:14
Don't click that shit. Nothing but ads and redirects. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 12:02:07
How do you know this? Did you just pull this out of your ass possibly?
@_date: 2014-09-15 12:02:10
Just stop it. Please. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 19:42:51
I was gonna explain some basic financial, investing and economics stuff but i realized it would be a total waste of time. 
You're too young. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 07:46:20
But if they would use Bitcoin you would love them. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 14:15:44
Yes we know. There was already a big topic about it here. 
If only you people could stop reposting everything 10 times. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 12:34:09
70% upvoted. Hilarious. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 15:15:50
Actually yes they can do plenty of things against that. Get out of your stoned anarchist fantasy world. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:25:06
Wow, any idea how fucking pathetic and childish that sounds? Also you have to be completely delusional if you think that bothers me. 
Actually the fact that my posts affect your life in such a retarded way highly enjoys me. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:52:38
Those who downvote me feel free to explain why. What did i say that is so worthy of your downvotes?
@_date: 2014-09-16 19:17:23
Oh god...
Look kiddo, i am as much a Bitcoin supporter as the next person here but unlike many here i don't live in fantasy land. 
I don't have to show you this years Bitcoin charts and explain to you why someone who is losing money won't put it in Bitcoin instead. Or do i?
Nobody in his right mind would do that at this point. 
Please don't tell me this is why i'm being downvoted. Because i mentioned Bitcoin is going down. And has been doing so for months. 
That would be pathetic as hell. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:30:58
Stop posting random financial news here all day you annoying idiot!
@_date: 2014-09-11 07:44:13
Stop lying. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 19:03:25
Tired of waiting for what? You act as if the price is guaranteed to go up. Sorry, it isn't. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:41:37
Discussed at least 50 times already. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 12:40:24
Just stop posting here. You make the rest of us look stupid. Bitcoin is better off without delusional cultists like you.
