What would other coins' fees and transaction times look like if they had the volume of Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:17:47
If matters where we take our BTFD business.

Surprised we haven't seen any "do something" memes

USD works as money even though most transactions happen through third parties... credit cards, Venmo, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:52:09
Probably both.

I continue to HODL, so I still have equal parts BCH and BTC, right? And selling off BCH would have no effect on my BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:13:32
It's probably not as simple as transferring it back to an exchange. Depending on the type of storage you are using, there are different ways of extracting your BCH to a BCH specific wallet.

Good news is...it's still a great time to buy! Bitcoin might not be getting any lower, but it sure as hell is going to the moon! BUY AND HODL NOW NOW NOW!

You're killing me Smalls.
Cliche ≠  hyperbole.
Inception is covered under the umbrella of the hyperbolic "yesterday." 
Stop being difficult.

You're obviously intelligent but inexplicably being an ass, so I'll leave you with that and move on.

Those are just the bitcoin rules! I don’t have any altcoin rules 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:54:34
“Yesterday” being hyperbolic....

EAT IT JIHAN
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:21:08
My rules (I didn’t make them up, just aggregated):
1. Always talk about Bitcoin. 
2. Never talk about your bitcoin. 
3. The best time to buy was yesterday. The second best time is now.

I think these pairs will be used.

ELI5? 
Edit: for those confused like me, his tweet says they agreed to an 8Mbit base block size. 8Mbits = 1MByte, or 1MB, which is what Bitcoin currently has. Smart joke!
