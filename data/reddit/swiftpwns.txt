Bitcoin is hitting mainstream and this fludgates have opened unto these understaffed exchanges, I know you're all worried about your unanswered tickets, but that doesn't mean you can come up with things to justify the unaswered tickets. Be patient.
My first basic verification didn't go thorugh so I had to continue with the enhanced one, the enhanced one failed because the bot didn't recognize similarity between the letter Č on m ID card photo and the letter the same letter on the website because it got converted to another sign.

Correct, the pin is for that specific Trezor device only. You can load up into another Trezor or any other wallet with just the 24 word seed.
 
  
The passphrase is  a different story though, you need it same as the seed.
Directly from Trezor FAQ wiki: 
**You have forgotten or lost your PIN**
You can always reset your PIN by wiping the device and recovering it using your recovery seed. See Wiping the Trezor device for detailed instructions.  
**You have forgotten or lost your passphrase**
Similar to the loss of your recovery seed, this is also an unfortunately irreversible circumstance. Nobody can help you access passphrase protected accounts.

1-5 business days, thats the time it would take for the wire transfers, excluding weekends of course. That's considering you have an exchange account with enough verification tiers to allow you to pull out as much as you want.  
Something like selling through localbitcoins would be faster.

**Please read this.**   
**Mining** isn't really profitable with a PC anymore, you would have to buy a specialized computer unit which costs a few grand, and even then the yield isn't that much. Times have changed a lot, you have missed the times where you could mine with just your PC, things slowed down, there are many more people in the game and the competition is very strong. There are several multibilion crypto mining companies.  
"I still don't understand why it depreciates in a sense"  
Hardware advances all the time, it will yield you less and less as better hardware gets released.
The way you approach mining nowadays on a 1-person scale is by getting a few gpus and building a mining rig, then mine an altcoin (not bitcoin) that is profitable to mine and then you just exchange it to bitcoin. You also mentioned that you have low to none computer knowledge.  I would strongly advise against going down any mining path. I am talking from experience, it would have ben a lot more profitable for me to just buy more bitcoin when I started my mining adventure plus it costed me a lot of time and some nervers. Just buying bitcoin is simpler, easier and  way less time consuming.
**Learn more** . You think you know enough but you don't, go to [Andreas Antonopoulos's]( youtube channel, sort videos by most popular and watch some of that.  Check out this subreddit on a daily or weekly basis, get yourself familiar with the crypto atmosphere, the community, the news, the advancements.
**Just try it out.**  I don't know where your'e from, so just do a google search for lists of the most popular bitcoin exchanges and see which ones work in your country and go with one.  Get a mobile app, get to know how it feels buying something with bitcoin.  And then if you plan to invest more,  get a hardware wallet so you can store your bulk safely.

A lot of us are waiting man, as there is a huge influx of new users they have a huge backlog to go through and that results in people panicking and writing more tickets, making a snowball effect and making things way worse than they already are. Keep calm and wait, nextime do exchange stuff during the calm, not during the storm to avoid delays.

Only with old software versions and the attacker would require physical access to your trezor and he would have to be a professional.  
Even by the offchance that you lose the wallet, the chances that someone like that finds it are slim to none.
And that is all considering if you still have unpatched software. If your's is up to date there is no flaw that someone could exploit.
Just make sure to have your seed at atleast 2 places. If you only have it at home and your house burns down, what do you do?     
Also, consider learning the seed, I'd recommend that for anyone that holds at least 10 grand worth.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:06:02
Exactly how I feel, people are being greedy and impatient as per usual, HODL on and go about your daily life as per usual, we didnt hit mass adoption yet.

The earlier the better, buy as much as you can afford to lose, educate yourself about it, no you dont have to buy a whole bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:50:25
Change banks to one that has a less agressive stance against bitcoin, inform yourself which bank, if any in your area that might be. If you can't find any information about that you could just go to banks directly and talk with the advisors if they have experiences with bitcoin users and see what they got to say.

One thing to add, bitcoin mining does not actually use a lot of energy compared to other things, for example the energy for fiat money or gold, espesically because a lot of big bitcoin mines use power from dams and other such sources where they take use of excess produced energy.
But all-in-all this argument does not even matter because in a few years most electricity will be clean.
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:13:14
The cheaper one, when I bought it, the T one was not released yet, but I'd still buy the same one, they do the same thing, one is just fancier.   
Remember this is something you don't handle very often, its where you send your coins to and HODL them, it doesn't need to be fancy.

I bought a hardware cold wallet the second the value of my bitcoins was the value of a hardware cold wallet. The sooner you do it, less worry you will have later on, also during bull runs these things tend to sell out and have long shipping times, I'd get it now while its still calm.
@_date: 2019-05-28 17:21:25
Terrible analogy again, price of Gold going up was not unique because Gold wasn't a new technological internet breakthrough that seems like the next logical step.
The internet's birth, like many people here in the comments are refering to is the perfect analogy, something new arising, with clear advantages over its predecessor and only the ones with enough knowlege are the first to see its potential.
His gut feeling doesn't arrive from him liking how bitcoin is marketed and probably not by the bubbles either, but from the advantages he sees in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:41:03
This is what bitcoin is becoming, too high fees to move it, so you just HODL.
