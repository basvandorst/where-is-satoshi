It would be even easier on the streets lol. hookers have cell phones. all they need is a mobile wallet. Scan there QR code, send em some coin and get porkin. probably easier and less risky then dealing with bundles of cash

Maybe a small drop in hash rate from some China miners getting booted off the network. Other then that, nothing. 
@_date: 2019-03-09 15:09:43
That was probably before the price drop. These days mining has become much less centralized in China.

Naa but better yet, you can roll up your private key back up phrase, set it on fire and light up all the same.

Yes, mine what ever coin is most profitable with your rig set up, then convert those coins into bitcoin. Or better yet, just sell your computing power to the highest bidder on [ and get paid out in bitcoin.

It’s crazy to me how they are allowed to just change up such an important index to show whatever results they want. Sounds like fraud to me. I don’t understand how this isn’t a more talked about issue. Its basically the reason why the middle class in America is disappearing. Thanks for the link, I’ll definitely check it out.

I highly recommend choosing a wallet from this list as opposed to lumi--  [
I have never heard anything about lumi wallet. I personally use electrum, its great.
[  found this regarding lumi, proceed with caution.

Very well done sir! Top notch content.

Most exchanges that offer fiat pairs require id these days. Any wallet that isn’t also an exchange will not require anything

I think the cost of mobile phones will continue to decrease as the technology used to produce them continues to improve and become more efficient.. Prices have dropped dramatically in almost every tech sector over the last 18 years. The drop in computer hardware is particularly steep. Internet connectivity is another thing that will continue to be rapidly developed and enhanced across the world as it has been since its inception. Since 2012 alone the number of ppl connected to the internet as grown by 82%.. All I'm really trying to say is that based on my observed trends of time, it looks to me like internet connectivity will continue to drastically increase, mobile phone prices will continue to drop, bitcoins infrastructure will continue to be developed and strengthened all while the purchasing power of fiat around the globe will continue to drop.. I'm not saying bitcoin will become a global reserve currency over night, I just think it will slowly continue to develop into the more attractive option for ppl to use as a medium of exchange/store of value as these trends continue.

Maybe. Only time will truly tell. However according to the law of accelerating returns, the pace at which technology grows tends to speed up exponentially over time because each new generation of tech builds on the improvements of the previous generation leading to a positive feedback loop of improvements. As far as electricity goes, the % of ppl with access to electricity has been rising steadily over the last few decades. Only around 16% of the world doesn't have steady access to electricity at this time but these numbers will keep on the decline as the cost of renewable energy sources continues to drop and become more affordable and effective with technological advances in production and development. Over the last few years alone the cost of solar panels has dropped over 60%.

Sounds like you bought using a bank account (ACH). This payment option can take a few days due to the way the old school banks settle payments and such. If you use a debit/credit card you should be able to move your coins off of coinbase immediately after buying them.

I agree that btc is not ready to be the official global currency in its current state. However I think its safe to say that btc will most definitely not just sit idle going forward into the future. It will continue to be developed and improved upon by the massive open source community btc has behind it. As the tech improves becoming more user friendly and robust, it will become a more viable option to meet the needs of the unbanked around the world. Btc as a competitor to fiat is a good thing for the consumers. It may not completely replace gov money, but it will be something that gov money has to compete against. This competition will hopefully incentivize govs to run a more conservative fiscal policy.

I think you may be surprised at the mobile phone penetration rate in developing countries. These days more people have access to mobile phones then they do to clean water or electricity 
 
There is a phone called the "freedom 251" that only cost $4. The trend of digitization in general is one that doesn't seem to be slowing down at all. It makes sense to me that bitcoins value proposition will only increase as this trend continues. Look at "Metcalfe's law". I also don't think its fair to say btc has put up more barriers for ppl. If anything it has simply given them another choice. With that said i def agree with you that bitcoin is ahead of its time. However the world is catching up at a really fast rate. It will be really interesting to see how the tech is being used in the next 5-10 years.
