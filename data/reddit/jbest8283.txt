You mean the part where it specifically says you're not allowed to sell Bitcoin miners? I think people are failing to see the point here. It's not that they don't let you buy virtual currency, it that they won't let you sell a computer.

Depending on the rig, he was probably doing anywhere between 250-500khash/s which, today, would give him between 0.002btc and 0.004btc a day. I'm sure a few months ago he was making more LTC than that. I guess it really depends on when they were sold...LTC was worth 40$ each for a short period.

@_date: 2013-11-05 01:40:13
Think about the fact that some/most of the people with huge reserves of BTC mined it or obtained it a few years ago when It was worthless. It only looks like a lot of money because they are now worth $240 a piece.

Bravo! Think about Bitcoin as a startup business. It has issues whether in the market or financially, but at the core it has people who believe in it and will follow it off a cliff. The entrepreneur is usually the one who sees it coming and is smart enough to bail, the believers jump over. But, if that startup makes it, the believers win. It's all risk.
I see you post this stuff all the time but you say you have "tons" of coin.
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:42:55
This is exactly what constitutes the adoption. People who no nothing about it all of a sudden have it. Wether they are using it to try to make some quick cash is irrelevant (and probable). They are still learning about it and telling friends. Some are immature kids who just made their first thousand dollars because they bought in at $500. But they are still participating in this monumental event.
I have to say, if my 15 year old self were here making the dollar value I have from Bitcoin I would be posting memes and screaming "moon!" all the time (I ocassionally do...).
It's a neat game to play and it's neat to think that maybe we could all be rich because we believed in change.
@_date: 2013-12-16 11:37:41
And there no problem telling people where to look for answers. But you can do so with decency.
@_date: 2013-12-16 11:34:29
This isn't a crash, it's a correction. When the price jumps from $750 to 1250 in a couple of days it's bound to drop. When it drops %50 and stays there for an hour or two it's not a crash. It's been extremely steady for a whole now at ~$850, you may experience another small drop next week for Christmas... It may go up. But I assure you, if bitcoin crash's, you will know.

While I agree with this entirely, That is the start of adoption. I would bet (not a blowjob) that you are more intelligent than the average person, so its something you notice.

I have to point out that anyone who compares Bitcoin to beanie babies needs their head examined...I know you are referring to an article and I am too.
I am not economically inclined so I definitely have no weight in this but I will say that when Bitcoin is accepted in most places that accept FIAT, you will see it's true value. I don't think that the correlation between merchants accepting it and the price increase is a coincidence. Sure, some of the value is speculation but some of the value is also acceptance, and that is gaining ground daily. 
This technology is too important to lose. I may be biased because I own some but I see this becoming worth **way** more than it is now. The fact that people have started using uBTC is mind blowing.

Ok, so someone bought a pizza for 10,000btc. Sure, that's the "beginning". We currently have an introduction to the mainstream. That's the beginning. As much as I like to dream, I don't care about the money side of this. I would like to be able to retain at least what I put into it, which is VERY minimal, but I would rather see it become something.

2) Gold in its infancy. 1 oz of gold was very volatile for a long time and depending on what you feel as volatile, it still is.

I don't mean to be "that guy" and this in no way means that it *couldn't* drop to nothing, but it has launched to a global scale. There would have to be some serious pressure to kill Bitcoin and I think from the acceptance, even tolerance, of a few countries already is an incredible sign that it's getting less and less risky.

Yes. As is the reason it drops most of the time. I think that's the reason it didn't "crash" when silk road got shut down, people believe in it more now. I believe it's almost a self fulfilling prophecy and the only time it would makes sense to remotely think of running is if governments crack down on it. Whether or not it amounts to a ridiculous sum in the next few years is to be seen. But at the very least, you can save or easily invest in new startups.

The exact same thing happens in markets now. Early adopters and people with a lot of money manipulate it. 
Personally, at a very basic and potentially naive level, the number of articles from reputable news sites is a big indicator of what it could be. If this was a "scheme" it would have been squashed already. The bitcoin community aren't the only people able to access the code for how this whole system works. Its already been said that government officials have been through it and found it to be sound. I would wager that anyone who is completely against the growth of bitcoin has a huge stake in the fiat world.

I think the ability to send and receive Bitcoin as an individual or merchant with no fees is an incentive.
I believe the ability to sent and receive with complete anonymity is still an incentive.
I believe that if you believe current FIAT is backed by anything other than speculation you are naive.

@_date: 2013-10-22 09:41:45
Its amazing how reluctant some people are to help spread the word about something they think is world changing...anyway...
I am pretty new to bitcoin. When I first started I spent money on creating a GPU miner (don't do it). I started trying to mine BTC but quickly realized it wasn't feasible at all. I switched to LTC   and made a bit of money. GPU miners were pretty much going away (if you didn't have a monstrosity of a machine you could barely even mine LTC anymore) so o stopped and sold the machine to recoup my money, which I did. I then decoded to just start buying them.
 I live in Canada and use CaVirtex. After I purchased a few I started buying shares in companies with them on Havelock Investments. This is pretty much where I have ended up. I trade some bitcoin every day and make a little bit buy reading the charts.
The whole process of where I started to where I ended has been awesome and I hope it continues to stay this cool. Enjoy the brave new world, and welcome to the ground level.

@_date: 2013-12-16 19:37:35
It seems like it's trying to stay at 750. I believe it will be between $650 and $750 and stay there for a while. It needs to give some sort of stability over a period of time, and when it does, it will bring more people in.
My perception of a crash will be if this hit $200 or lower and that may be generous. China is currently crushing the price but I think it's for the best right now because it did get incredibly high, incredibly fast. Even between $650 and $750 it's high but much more manageable. 
I don't know, I'm talking out of my ass but I assure you that if this actually crash's there will be no mistaking it.
edit: while I'm writing this BTCChina is heading toward $600. This will be bumpy.

We are still at the "real beginning" of this and you know it. Prior to July, no one knew about Bitcoin. That's July 2013...The beginning is when it is written about daily in papers and magazines. The beginning is when you see companies like Bitpay crossing the $100mil mark. The beginning is when you see a university accepting Bitcoin for tuition in Cyprus. I can go on.
When you don't see it in the media anymore and you walk into a walmart that has things priced in BTC, we reached our goal.
@_date: 2013-12-07 13:41:58
Ok, first of all, the news from China was not devastating. There was news
 from the UK that changed regulations for the better. Bank of America's, David Woo, weighed in on bitcoin in a good way. A  Lamborghini dealer in New Port started accepting bitcoin and actually sold a Tesla. ZipZap will be adding 28,000 locations to let people but bitcoin. The biggest university/ institution in Cyprus stated accepting bitcoin for tuition and has already received tuition in BTC. 
There is a ridiculous amount of good news around bitcoin right now but the media will only jump on the negative. If you sell off your coins because of a little bad news when there is a substantially higher number of good news then maybe you should just spot it when the rest do. There's absolutely no shame in saying you were part of this revolution but had to back out because it was too volatile. It's not for everyone.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:59:02
I actually can't even believe you went there. The point was that the traditional market has had 227 years to grow with the acceptance of the US gov. Bitcoin has been around for 3 with basically complete hatred for it by any government establishment and has only become an accepted form of payment for some businesses. 
There is going to be a huge shift in wealth in the coming years the likes of which will make your head spin.

I agree that it can drown out relevant info but that's what down voting is for. Telling someone off definitely does not help address their issue.  They came here, we got them, they're interested don't stone them. Some people like to know that someone is there to hold their hand, we need to suck it up because that's what we are here for.

Its extremely bothersome. I watch it day in and day out and now I'm even more interested. Wondering why it falters, when it will pick back up, how my stocks will do... Takes a toll on the mind

where are you?
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:20:38
It actually doesn't matter. If you look at it as a way to have flat than you're doing it wrong. It will be a very recognized currency and you will have some at some point. The amount you have depends on what you do right now.
@_date: 2013-11-08 01:23:45
I think the point of this is to say we need to switch to mBTC...maybe?
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:22:54
Yes because its extremely simple to tell someone who probably isn't tech savvy how the bitcoin protocol works. Its very easy to argue, with a person who has grown up using actual cash for most of their life, that magic internet money is taking over. Yes you're right, bitcoin is a failure, nothing to see here.

We're already seeing "could replace". Just watch the show, its rather fun.
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:00:47
Yes but I think bitstamp is having issues with BTC withdrawal. There are a couple of people taking about it right now.
I've never put USD in btc-e but I have transferred a few coins to trade for alts and have never had a problem.
@_date: 2013-12-16 11:40:03
The point is, most of the time they don't even get that. They usually get "Why you so stupid, stupid?"
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:14:46
Yes, you can. Now tell everyone you know!

People sell houses for millions, in bitcoin. People sell cars for hundreds of thousands in bitcoin. Just because you would do it with "fake internet moniez" doesn't mean the rest of the world won't leave you behind.
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:30:16
Hell yes! Take my money!
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:02:06
Yeah, I transferred coin into it...then transferred it out. The amount of time I wasted to cancel a buy order was insane. Not worth it to buy QRK.
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:51:06
Of course we will. Though it will always fluctuate, it will level out like gold.
@_date: 2013-10-10 20:05:06
My credit score is in extremely good standing. Not worried about one BS CC company ruining it. Ill have the last laugh when bitcoin takes over anyway.

17 cents when referenced to a dollar is a lot...
What's 17% of a mil?
@_date: 2013-11-09 12:00:05
Or, you know, don't stay away from them and make money... I invested in it with no issues. Bitcoin sent to me every day
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:42:53
If people accepted Beanie Babies as a form of payment you could. Hypothetically if someone were so inclined and wanted a Beanie Baby they could purchase a pizza and trade for it...But I digress. 
It's odd that you referenced Beanie Babies without seeing the article/video (can't remember what it was) but it was CNN.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:50:19
He's actually probably right
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:01:19
This is completely true, and I know it. Its just so hard to remove yourself fro. The goof news and its even harder to run from the bad.
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:18:22
The fact that this is even on the news, in the same sentences with NASDAQ, point of conversation at the US senate meeting, is absolutely INSANE!
We are one step closer to bringing a new age of technology. I am extremely proud to be in the internet and Bitcoin generation.

This is extremely disappointing to read. You seem like a brilliant 8th grader and should be treated as such. DO NOT stop what you are doing, and change the world.

@_date: 2013-12-06 11:07:12
Most people are sheep. When the I internet came around a lot of sheep had no idea what it was or how it worked, they were afraid. By nature we are afraid of change.
I've created paper QR codes to the BTC wiki that I give to people or just leave in random locations. Just point then in the general direction and of they are interested they will find out for themselves. Is harkening with or without them but I know it's hard to feel like you're the only one in a room watching a revolution.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:30:39
Why would they accept dollars? We KNOW that it's worth less every day.
It is a gamble, but an increasingly better one every day. That 100BTC Maserati (~$100,000) could be worth more next week if Bitcoin goes up. People are taking advantage of the infancy of Bitcoin and selling something big like a car would maximize the potential returns. (I realize this can go both ways, but they are confident in it increasing)
@_date: 2013-10-09 13:30:11
Yeah...they like to reverse payments. That's what happened to me. Good thing I was only selling Litecoins 
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:34:09
I actually think its clever. People always associate bitcoin with illegal activities so to throw in college tuition at the end makes people realize that it can finally be used for more than that.
@_date: 2013-10-12 19:32:53
If you look at bitcoin as being a way to make FIAT, you're doing it wrong.

The funny thing is it been hitting "record highs" every day for the last week
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:59:55
Delusion... I love when people blatantly say that as if bitcoin hasn't climbed from a few dollars to 1k in a year. The fact is, no one knows what will happen. If a bitcoin is worth 100k at some point will you come back and apologize? No. But I'm sure that if in a year its still at 1k you will be back laughing.

He's not the only one who believes it's worth more. But as they say, it could be worth anywhere between 0 and infinity. To quote a famous toy, "to infinity, and beyond!".
I jest. I believe in bitcoin and most of its community. Its been said time and time again that magic internet money is the future, we just don't really know if bitcoin is just a stepping stone.

By the way what's the price now?
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:47:43
Ok, so USD has been around since 1786. Your comparing 13mil being traded through exchanges every second...a currency that has been around for 227 years. Bitcoin is trading 13mil in 24hrs...a currency that has been around for 3 years. 
The truth is, Bitcoin is already challenging the dollar. Bitcoin is a world currency; that's the challenge.

The biggest problem is we keep looking at it as USD. There will come a time when that lamp is worth 0.002btc, and that will be all. There will be no conversion. We pay what we think is reasonable. We are in control now.
@_date: 2013-11-08 01:31:48
The average population DOES NOT have the capability of understanding this, it's a terrible fact. I know this is something that should come with years of practice but I think in this day and age we can come up with a better "Marketing" conversion than this.
People don't even want to get into it because all we talk about are Bitcoins. When we really should now be using mBTC as the norm. I don't believe that a "Satoshi" has any marketing capability at all. 
@_date: 2013-10-16 16:49:05
"Bitcoin is used for drugs" 
Indicates that Bitcoin's sole purpose is for drugs. It's very easy to get defensive over the statement when most of the people here use Bitcoin for everything else besides. Regardless of what you actually meant, that's what was stated.
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:42:06
There will be banks specific for Bitcoin. Check Neo &amp; Bee
Its not that people will never use a bank, but for people who don't feel like they can keep them secure, its a good option.
