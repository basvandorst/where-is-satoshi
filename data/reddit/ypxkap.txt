i would strongly disagree that the idea of induced demand is being taken out of context by urban planners to argue against increased capacity. if anything, not enough attention is given to this fundamental concept by policy makers because they fear political consequences. 
the 405 moves nearly 400k commuters per day at its current capacity. let's double it to 800k, a multi-billion dollar decades long project. now the freeway can serve twice as many people. 
immediately, this will happen: 
-people who commute at off peak times to avoid traffic start leaving work when they're done.
-people from the valley who weren't willing to work in west LA start looking for newer, higher paying jobs there.
-people who were paying more in rent to avoid this commute move to the valley and drive on the new 405 because it saves them money.
-companies that were considering moving to the valley no longer have any incentive to do so.
-the population of LA has grown 20% in the time it took to expand the lanes and most of the growth will occur in areas serviced by the 405. 
This has been scientifically demonstrated to very quickly (years, not decades) eat up any efficiency gains made in the network. (check out the aforementioned induced demand, also [the law of peak hour expressway congestion]( [Marchetti's constant]( the [downs–thomson paradox]( [i-10 in texas]( etc...)
also, with twice as many cars coming in on the 405, we have to double the capacity of the vast majority of the roads in adjacent areas, AND we have to find parking for the 400k new cars. west LA would basically just be one giant road.
as i said, there are many reasons this isn't applicable to bitcoin, i'm not talking about bitcoin at all. but the reason the LA MTA won't continue to spend huge sums of its tax revenue to widen lanes isn't a conspiracy at all. it's been studied, it's been tried, it doesn't work.

the concept of induced demand is well researched both by the economists mentioned in the article and countless others in urban planning circles. also, the research this article was about explicitly does try to control for the factors you mentioned.
whether or not it's a valid metaphor for bitcoin is debatable (it probably isn't...) but unless you consider the study of economics to be pseudoscience you have no basis to make that claim.
