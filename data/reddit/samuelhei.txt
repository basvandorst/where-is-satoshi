Hola, aceptas reales brasileños?
@_date: 2014-03-28 11:23:58
Yeah, is like 628,54 dollars.
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:45:14
I do.
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:59:57
Good one. We need more like that here.
@_date: 2014-04-09 23:17:01
Exchange rate! Now in the bitinvest 1 BTC are 588,51 canadian dollars
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:45:06
The problem is add money to btc-e from Brazil.
@_date: 2014-04-09 23:02:38
Very nice!
@_date: 2014-05-09 14:12:03
Good point, but it depends what price based they use, BTC will be volatile if people sells their goods for dollar based price, and against is true.
@_date: 2014-05-26 20:27:25
I think gyft can do that. 
@_date: 2015-08-07 12:31:41
Like a payment gateway, but the user deposit FIAT in the Exchange and the Exchange pays bitcoin to the service provider.
@_date: 2015-08-07 12:39:23
With bitpay you pay with bitcoin and the seller receive fiat. My idea is to pay with fiat and the seller receive bitcoin. This is when the bitcoin is the only payment method.
@_date: 2015-08-03 11:49:48
Thanks, I will add.
@_date: 2015-07-29 22:38:05
Thank you for your wisdom I believe there is light at the end of this tunnel too, we need more discussions like this to improve our companies (yes, as customers, they are ours).
I really don't expected this page have so much attention from the btcjam staff, when I experienced the support service before was quite frustrating, and for what I see now I take my hat off.
I will be pleased to hear more. Please, keep me updated.

So for example if one person needs a loan for health reasons, how use escrow or smart-contract for collateral?
@_date: 2015-07-29 23:59:18
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:28:14
Thanks for the response.
@_date: 2015-07-29 18:12:17
This is sad, we are running out of options. What anti-fraud features do you suggest?
@_date: 2015-07-29 22:39:05
Sorry for your loss. Do you used autoinvest?
@_date: 2015-07-31 11:39:18
@_date: 2015-07-29 17:39:22
Good Ideias! Sad that the btcjam have the no listening to the users policy. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 17:33:54
So many sad stories :(
@_date: 2015-07-29 23:34:20
ok, why not.
@_date: 2015-07-30 01:47:26
@_date: 2015-07-29 17:20:40
Good Strategy!
@_date: 2015-07-29 17:25:55
I am not a active investor there, but thanks! What do you think that the btcjam can mature?
@_date: 2015-07-30 00:12:14
No worries, we are all here for the same. 1000 bits @_date: 2015-07-29 17:45:04
Wow! I was only thinking that the returns are lower than they sell it but negative returns is a new story. This is false advertising! 
@_date: 2015-07-30 11:26:00
@_date: 2015-07-30 00:05:59
Thank you again for the tip and the words of wisdom.
@_date: 2015-07-29 17:21:28
Do you have a idea how the collateral can be done?
@_date: 2015-07-29 23:55:45
This massive support from btcjam staff is new to me, other times when I experienced the support service was frustrating. I said, and said again I take my hat off for the support now I'm seeing. And I will add in next edit a appologies to btcjam staff. Thank you!
@_date: 2015-07-29 17:35:34
It is sad to say, but 
@_date: 2015-07-29 17:24:11
Yes, that is what they sell to us, but with this scam rate I am not surprised. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 01:16:08
I will add this link to my next edit. We will be pleased to hear about your updates.
@_date: 2015-07-29 17:19:23
I lost a bit of money there too, but I was not a active investor. In Brazilian Bitcoin group  there are people reporting big losses too and most experienced people there don't recomend btcjam at all. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:00:29
Thanks for the response Gustavo, I'm not looking only to me, I already lost my hope in btcjam, I'm looking for the people that deserves the truth.
If it is not exponential it leave us with the annualized return in 30% (12 * 0.025) in 0% fraud. This is 18% is 60% of expected return, or 40% of fraud. This still a big number.
And look after they claim that the return is not 18% but -22%! What was the wrong math?
Can you clarify all the doubts of this topic? 
@_date: 2015-07-29 17:26:42
I agree, but do you have a idea how the collateral can be done?
@_date: 2015-07-30 11:36:32
I think deserve a response too. I'm only providing visibility.
@_date: 2015-07-29 17:28:50
Good point.
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:33:53
The return is in check too, but this is not the question he asked.
@_date: 2015-07-29 15:14:29
hehe :)
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:23:23
Thanks BTCJammer for the response, let's hope that it can resolve all issues. But listen to the community is a great step. Congratulations.
@_date: 2015-07-31 11:38:19
Thanks for tagging. To all be clear, you are saying that if we have diversified in only 50 plans instead 80 or 100 is possible to get negative returns like had?
@_date: 2015-07-29 22:48:56
and I will add this to the next edit too.
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:16:41
Most likely it is a hardware problem, so you need a reliable technician to look for components that's not working, or you can buy other mSata (like yours) and replace the storage components.
@_date: 2015-11-18 10:23:15
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:29:07
Let's hope someone here place a better solution. :)
