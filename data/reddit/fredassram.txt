The community has really evolved of late... for the better I think
@_date: 2015-05-05 20:18:11
Have been a long time user of Circle and referred many friends in US and Europe. Never had issues with signing up. Did you try calling their support line?
To be fair I prefer to buy on exchange as well. Bitstamp is very reliable for me

Great to see the Coinbase brigade hard at work downvoting all the negative comments in this thread

Ooh Argument from Authority... one of my favorite logical fallacies

Easiest would be to look at a chart of Bitcoin prices.
Next best thing to do is to read 's blog at ofnumbers.com for some analysis of Bitpay and other Bitcoin companies' performance over time.
@_date: 2015-08-24 05:24:39
You're right about the shittiness of their payment processing operations (and of the Bitcoin payment processing industry generally)
Also Coinbase optimistically generates like $2-3mm a year off their exchange (10k coins per day traded, 30bps per taker side). $1bn valuation? Color me incredulous

Based on first-hand experience and independent analysis like Swanson's, yes BTC ecosystem is in multi-year decline
@_date: 2015-08-23 17:12:25
solid reasoning bro. 
I remember this one time I came to the conclusion that Jobs and Bezos were mean people. And so I smashed my iPhone and cancelled my Prime membership.

Wow the fifth Circle bashing post this weekend.
It's cool to see Coinbase finally stepping up their marketing spend
@_date: 2015-08-24 06:42:19
Oh ok buddy. Look at the state of the Bitcoin ecosystem. It's been in a perpetual state of decline for the last 2 years. If anything I would expect their revs to go down over time. So yeah... if you think the market would reward Coinbase with a 400x revs multiple on flat to negative y/y growth... well I have some investment ideas to sell you
@_date: 2015-08-21 21:08:19
You realize that when you sell on Circle you actually get a better than market rate right? So you can actually go rebuy your BTC at Coinbase at a profit. 
You fucking moron
@_date: 2015-07-30 03:06:29
Shit man. Do you think it will turn them off of BTC when you get arrested for running an unlicensed money transmitter operation?
@_date: 2015-08-25 16:17:55
I would wager not. If you had a high-quality, growing, cash cow business like their 1% fee business, you would not cannabalize it by creating a 0 fee maker exchange. My guess is they had to launch the exchange to demonstrate the type of "growth" that their simple-minded VCs demand, which in general generates 0 to negative return on invested capital
@_date: 2015-04-30 03:47:07
Unequivocally positive for Bitcoin!

You mean Halsey Minor's history as California's biggest income tax delinquent?

The way it works is that when you start owning a large % of a company, you get to have board representation as well
@_date: 2015-04-08 03:24:16
You seriously gave zero weight to the theory that there are actually people out there who are expressing their unhappiness with Coinbase? Are you that arrogant and dense?
Blockchain, Circle, Xapo are all regularly the target of r/bitcoin's wrath.
Did it seriously never even cross your mind that people might also hate Coinbase?
@_date: 2015-04-30 07:06:11
Have used circle for many months and it's always been buy and sell at same price
Edit: just tried it now and it is still 0 spread...I suppose we wait and see if it stays that way with the new products they are releasing
@_date: 2015-04-04 19:26:47
Bitcoin.org has a number of resources. Personally I use circle.com mainly and sometimes coinbase.com to buy, sell and store BTC. Trying to secure your own private keys (vs using credible, US-based, VC-backed web wallets) is vastly overrated. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 11:23:24
Move your coins to Circle or Xapo where they will be completely insured against loss or theft. Don't take the risk of holding your own private keys if you're not confident in your own technical abilities 
@_date: 2015-04-21 02:54:29
I don't really get your point. Why don't you just use Circle to buy via credit card?
@_date: 2015-04-06 13:44:45
But...but...Internet of Things...Money of the Future...
@_date: 2015-04-06 12:52:58
Great story. When do we get the "rare inside look" into Bitpay, Circle and 21?
@_date: 2015-04-30 07:00:18
I also get all of my financial news from Rolling Stone magazine. 
@_date: 2015-04-04 19:19:17
Use circle.com instead. Link your bank account or credit/debit card.

cool response, coinbase employee
@_date: 2015-03-17 02:07:28
Good observation. Something you definitely couldn't do with Coinbase because of their ridiculous 1% transaction fees
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:10:09
Glad you had a good first experience with bitcoin via Circle. 
Safe to ignore most of the nutjobs/assholes on r/bitcoin these days. Most people here just like hating on various bitcoin companies and services. Such a toxic community
@_date: 2015-03-17 01:47:57
incorrect, read the rest of the comments on this thread
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:50:58
i think free means you can buy and sell at the same price with no additional fees on top. It doesn't mean they guarantee you can buy at a better rate than coinbase.
if you think the circle rate is too high, you can sell at that price with no fees on top. and then you can buy on coinbase to complete the arbitrage!
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:51:56
cool, hope coinbase doesn't read through your post history. you know, because of the drugs
@_date: 2015-03-17 01:40:02
Gemini might actually try to be in compliance with regulations instead of Coinbase pretending to be in compliance and then getting the shit smacked out of them by New York and California
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:52:39
totally agree with you -- circle has much to improve in this area
@_date: 2015-02-17 01:52:10
so literally you are doing USD -&gt; Coinbase (probably) -&gt; BTC -&gt; Gyft (via Coinbase) -&gt; Sears -&gt; Shell
in god's name why?
