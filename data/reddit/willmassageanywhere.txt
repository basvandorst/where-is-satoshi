Damn that is a shame.... So that fee is on top of your fee almost I might switch from coinbase for that reason. Thats bullshit

Rae, I'm talking about the fact then when I Go to buy BTC on coinable or ETH on the buy page the price of the BTC is higher than the current dashboard market price 
@_date: 2017-05-22 01:51:20
Thanks homie, what do you know about GDAX? I'm about to start using GDAX. Instead of directly buying off the coinable app. Have you used it 
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:00:12
Like..what do you mean.. the market rate is higher than their dashboard rate... then why don't they show that rate on their dashboard

Ok but like you would have to first move your btc to a Japanese exchange right? I heard all these foreign exchanges require you to have a in country bank account though to use them. Or are there exchanges that are anonymous 
@_date: 2017-06-03 12:12:38
This, transfer to electrum first for example. Suck dick that bitcoin Xfer fees are out of fucking control right now. Don't wanna pay 10 dollars just to move my btc.... wdf is going on
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:41:06
So the only important thing is that you are holding your coins in your own wallet, such as electrum, at the time ?

Its happened to me, about 7 months ago I sent 200$ in BTC to an address and it never came through. When I looked it up and contacted the service in charge both of us figured out It was a dump/fake/scam address just like this one. I only lost 200$ but just like this one there were poor chumps with much more BTC in the address with more being sent as I cried :(. 
How the fuck does this happen?
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:17:41
Its not a malware man Its a glitch. Same thing happened to me months ago from literally a computer that had just been reformatted
