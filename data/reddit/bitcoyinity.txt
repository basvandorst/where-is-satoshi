Bitcoin is essentialy created by "Miners" using modified processor computing running networks of computers or nodes working fancy mathematical equations or kind of like cracking a needle in a haystack puzzle, agreeing on a decentralized trusted  ledger. All in a peer to peer network ( think of napster and better yet Torrents.) Making sure double spends don't occur and push transactions all at the speed of light that can be sent anywhere in the world with almost zero transfaction fees. Creating a system that can spin off many other usefull innovations from the blockchain protocol that runs it. Therefore bitcoin creates a usefull incentive to barter for just like any other object of trade our society deems worthy be it cattle, cowrie shells, whales teeth and manillas (ornamental jewellery), such as the ancients used. Gold silver and precious metals in modern day and the next step is bitcoin, the Internet of money.

I indirectly know the guy that is behind this start up. He made his money at a real young age buying and selling domain names. It should be interesting to see how well this turns out.

Exactly. I spend coin as much as I try to spread the word of bitcoin. I sent my girlfriend more bitcoin today. She is getting the true meaning of it and is acquiring some through websites that do surveys etc. what I'm trying to say is spend bitcoin as much as you would horde it. If everyone took this approach we would be in a better place.

I read about this preparing to happen a few months ago and I'm glad it is going through. The more I see acceptance from  if investors the more hope I have. To the moon indeed.

Trying to talk my brother into buying some last year and then showing more and trying to get him to think about it. He's a good business man but is pretty slow to adopt new technology. The other day he basically told me he wouldn't even consider buying and learning about bitcoin. But he loves his Apple stock so he's tough to relate to.

I worked for my family's electronic voting company for years and the biggest thing I learned is how distrustful people of e voting. They didnt have a problem trusting an ATM for example but had major problems trusting our machines.
I am learning about cryptography and hope one day it comes into play building a secure voting system that assures accuracy, and security in the industry.

Way to go man. I've spent coin booking hotels the past few days due to an emergency. It couldn't have better timing for them to do this in my case. Cheapair gets my vote.

I gues it can. Depends on your woman.

I lost my cell phone and going through a hassle changing to another phone number so I couldn't buy if I wanted to. They use Authy and I was flagged to provide photo ID and a slew of questions like last log in date, name of new cell phone carrier and model of cell phone, reason why I'm switching. I understand the security measures but am starting to lose patience. Guess its time to put my coin in cold storage and peruse other interests for a lengthy time.
@_date: 2014-02-15 18:05:23
What I think about is bitcoin itself the product of some massively complex computer system no one knows about.

I got mine to start a coinbase account. She made a few millibits doing some bitcoin faucets and the likes. It's a start. It I don't think she will ever be as hardcore as me with it.

I have spent 11 of the 13 I have purchased in the past year. And I limited income. I believe in Bitcoin and want it to grow. But if I had more income to hord it I probably would have a
Nice amount in cold storage just for that purpose. 
In the next year as the developers and big venture capitalists dump more resources into the mix I think it will become more of a easy thing to do to spend instead of horde.

It's cool to see it shoot through the tubes without fail. I have to admit the first time I sent a transaction I was skeptical.

Lots of connotations can be derived from that movie. This is a good example. This article was a little all over the map with its assumptions but overall a pretty good read.

I'm foggy today. I'm homeless in one of the worst winters I've seen in years. But low and behold I saw that Cheapair.com is accepting bitcoin for thousands of hotels so I'm safe and warm tonight.

I'm pretty poor also but I was an early adopter and now I have a savings system that has been deflating. Besides, it's not as tempting to spend my coins as cash or credit cards because it is a new technology that isn't accepted everywhere just yet, so for once I have an incentive to save.

I have faith in Coinbase and they have already made security improvements for their API code. Sounds like some user had not implemented certain safety factors and got compromised not once but several times.
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:27:39
Not concerned about the price. Bitcoin isn't going anywhere and will bounce back up in time. There is so much computing power and money being added to the ecosystem that it will survive. The protocol and code is solid and will spin off new innovation we haven't even dreamed of yet. Computers and the Internet were pretty limited and in the realm of nerdy geek stuff just some fifteen years ago. We're just seeing growing pains that's all. Even if it all goes to zero I think I did pretty well and would have no regrets. I've learned much about everything from encryption to macroeconomics and have had a pretty cool hobby to tinker with.

Cold storage and paper wallets. Easy and secure way to produce for noobs.

There are many layers of complexity and simple answers are difficult to convey to a large part of the population. I try to tell 10 people each day something about bitcoin. At first not many people related just a year ago. Today I often get at least a , "oh I've heard about bitcoin." so I guess that makes me feel a littler better.

I am somewhat stuck with an old iPhone because of lack of income. But over a year ago I met a man that seemed lacking of computer tech but has happy as a clam to purchase a cheap android tablet. I'm talking a decreped homeless alcoholic on disability and foodstamps who hasnt worked a computer since the early 80's for publishing purposes. I played with an Android phone last December for a few weeks and installed Mycellium and really enjoyed the whole experience. So I feel your views are merited in my eyes.
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:19:20
This question has sprung up here for a while. Search for what others have posted. From my research it is not possible. Voting must be anonymous and untraceable. But I have different views to this. I am by no means an authority on this. But I have studied the blockchain protocol for almost two years and have been involved in electronic voting systems industry for almost 15 years and I have a feeling this can be done. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 03:06:57
I am constantly trying to think of ways to build a business around bitcoin but I'm not that tech savy. Buying bitcoin is all I can come with also.

 I don't like how the article spins criminal dealings with bitcoin because cash can be used just as well. I do however like to use articles such as these to demonstrate practical real world solutions to people unaware of bitcoin.
