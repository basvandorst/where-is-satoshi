I don't think alot of people here really grasp how big an undertaking this would be. To build a net neutral ISP would require building a completely new global internet infrastructure.
Do you think $93 million would be any where near enough to build a global back bone infrastructure? The UK alone is investing over a billion sterling in different broadband projects.
Even all the meshnet projects that exist are still reliant on existing infrastructure so they can eventually be censored.
Change will only occur from changes in government and demonstrations from your wallet. Don't support companies who do not believe in net neutrality.
Please stop drinking from the coolaide before posting.

I can tell you roughly how the bitmain time line will be.  
Bitmain will announce 7nm tech  
Bitmain will take pre-orders for 7nm tech  
Bitmain will use customers money to mine with 7nm tech for several months  
Bitmain will then release the miners to customers once the difficulty has considerably increased  
Bitmain customers will be happy with the big creamy load Wu has left around there ass because now they have 7nm tech  
Bitmain customers will only just recover their initial investment after several months, just in time for bitmain to rinse and repeat the cycle

Download the bitcoin core client.
disconnect your pc from the internet
Import your private key to BTC core.
Spend wisely!!
Do not listen to the bad advice here about importing to web wallets, or the ridiculous notion you need to brute force a public key. You have the private key therefore a wallet client can derive the public key from this. It is basic cryptography and mathematics.
And if you are not sure what you have is a public key or private key, again do not follow the bad advice given here of inputing this to a web based block explorer, if it is a private key it will be exposed, use the core client to look up the balance.

i dont think it was to prevent premine, as satoshi was still the first person to mine BTC and premine wasnt a thing untill the rise of the scam coin. bitcoin transactions are like a chain (hence blockchain) they need to know where the unspent outputs come from to verify they are unspent to spend them, at that point there was no transactions so an exception to the rule needed to be created to start the chain e.g the genesis block

The 51% attack is only if one person/entity can decide which transactions to into the blockchain.  This is a concern for big pools where there's a single pool operator making the decision about which tx are accepted, and the miners are just "drones" that follow along.  If that pool operator modifies his software to execute a double-spend, then he gets the mass of miners in the pool to come along with him by default (though, if it was proven he did this, many of those miners would jump ship and mine at a different pool).  
But with P2Pool, each individual miner gets to decide for him/herself which transactions go into the chain, as if each miner was mining solo.  So you get the decentralization of a bunch of independent miners, but they all still get to share the reward of the blocks.

login 
if (user enabled 2fa){
load 2fa
if (2fa input === computed 2fa){
load account
else no 2fa {
 load account
the MITMer doesn't know weather the logging in user has 2FA enabled so wouldn't know weather to display the 2fa input screen, of course they could just display the 2FA screen by default, but other wise they would have to like you say go look up see if it is enabled but how then would they insert the 2FA into the login process. If its the case that there is no 2FA on logging in but there is to transfer then your correct the wallet system is flawed

the Bitcoin Foundation isn't the defacto body/organisation we don't have to follow/support it people only do because its the only one. 
The foundation really does nothing to look out for bitcoins or the general bitcoin users interest so why do we insist on following it? They've had board members convicted of crimes due to links with silk road (as much as i like board members who stole our coins  M.K, links to the russian mafia, as well as countless other nefarious and corrupt activities.
Not to mention  leaving the foundation for lack of transparency
As with Bitcoin this is about consensus if we say "we don't want you representing us any more" setup a new trade body, thats run transparent and fairly, there's no reason why it cant work better. The only real issue is how a new body would take control of real estate such as bitcoin.com/org

Thanks guys the images are already on imgur
yes all the webservers ect is hosted on the bladecenter at the farm, we dont worry about the dark we just make the goats get on a treadmill and work off the grass they have been eating, the 2.5% fee is to invest in more goats, as someone pointed out on btctalk the more they eat the more they shit and the more the grass will grow so a bit of a catch 22 problem but that is only a minor issue :D 
in all seriousness once i finish off the nmc merge mining and we have some more people joining the pool we will drop the fee

why is cloud hashing considered a scam when a company can honsetly rent out part of there hashing power?

its about proving interest in the use of bitcoins, of course he could just buy the product in fiat and buy 10% value in bitcoins, but buying the product in bitcoins shows to merchants providing a bitcoin payment method people will use it, then buying the 110% back from an exchange shows people still want to deposit fiat in exchange for bitcoin.

this makes no sense, merchants who accept payment in bitcoin are instantly converting these to fiat by selling at market value on exchanges, increasing the volume of btc available to buy decreases the value. Decreasing the volume of btc available increases price, its simple economics of supply and demand.

There was some funny quotes in the video but on the whole its pretty stupid, especially the section on buying drugs with bitcoin and money laundering there was no need to include this as this isn't the sort of attention bitcoin needs to be successful, yes we know it happens (and its helpful) but why brag about it?
While i agree users should control their private keys, and a blockchain model with client side keys could be better. The idea of Circle is that its so simple even my nan whose set on not upgrading from her 3310 could use it.
And also you never touch up upon a key feature of Circle that is their right on the front page. so il link you again incase you didn't actually read it
[**Circle Bitcoin Deposits are insured**](
For a more detailed read, their TOS which you should always read for a site like this






So basically if their ever hacked and keys stolen, you'll get an insurance payout, If your hacked/phished due to lack of security on your part you won't. That seems fair to me, and since circle uses 2FA as default i see it pretty hard to do, They could take this one step further and use a .bit domain that utilises blockchain tech to ensure your visiting the official log-in url.

Come on lets not advise new comers to bad practices, its not safe you dont control the private keys, and coinbase are in the pockets of the us gov and can/will freeze your funds if they think is necessarily


Welcome to the bitcoin world, the easiest method id recommend downloading electrum creating a new wallet and storing the wallet.dat file on two usb sticks, put one usb stick away some where safe as a backup and use the other usb stick to store your wallet on and plug into your computer as and when you need to, make sure you delete the original wallet off your computer to make sure viruses and hackers can't steal it.
When creating your electrum wallet you will be provided a seed, write this down and store it with your backup wallet, this means if you ever loose/damage/corrupt either usb you can restore it in electrum from the seed.

@_date: 2014-10-23 15:32:07
i think the point is people over and over again suggest to enable 2FA and check https certs, dont store on online wallets on here yet people dont listen, then when you suggest that to people you get a barrage of shit saying "well you shouldn't have to"
You should take the same level of precautions with your bitcoins as you do your banking,  when you login to your online banking or email you check to see if the https connection is right (or at least i do) so why not do the same when logging into blockchain?
Also this bullshit attitude using TOR makes you invincible needs to be changed. TOR is only good for somewhat hiding your identity, it is not a security tool. and TOR has been well documented in its weaknesses, one being bad exit nodes, which is the whole catch 22 situation with using that network.
If you insist on wanting to store your bitcoins on a web wallet and want to hide your anonymity use a VPN. Their are recommended VPN providers that accept BTC and don't collect logs.
If you are highly paranoid about privacy you can still use TOR, but take sometime to look at the features and realise what you can do with it. TOR has a feature that lets you select your exit node
so why not setup a free amazon EC2 instance and install TOR and run it as an exit set your TOR config to use an exit node you control then your privacy is somewhat secured, same principle if you have the luxury of plugging a rasp pi into another network say friend/family.
Or go one step further tell your tor connection to then go to a VPN after to make the final connection, so the provider doesnt penalise you for using tor (such as coinbase)
The problem with is people use these tools such as TOR and tails as a defacto security tool that will make them invincible which really inst the case

i guess this is true maybe this reddit should have a big fuck off warning "DON"T STORE YOUR INTERNET CURRENCY ONLINE".
Another big issue is that  is currently rented by blockchain.info and the wallet section tells people to sign up and use their service no mention of the QT client or any alternatives, so like you say people think its the best place to store them.
But in the case of the OP in question i doubt he was a complete noob, but nearly there as he stated he used tails so he thought he was completely secure, and like i said above its really not for security, and only gives you certain levels of privacy if you use it right.

I know it's not in bitcoin and that's why I am saying the consensus is not the best out there. It is possible to increase security decentralisation and throughput with network size just not in bitcoin.


That is just a statement backed up with no fact.
Fact is there is what 2/3 reputable hardware supplies. Where they get their silicon made into chips at 2/3 foundries, which they have to compete with every other chip manufacture for production time? You are delusional if your argument is bitcoin is secure because of it's large asic mining infrastructure, but there is only a small hand full of players that provide the infrastructure.
If bitmain/ebang/canna decide to stop selling hardware where would you get it? bitfurry? great if you have a few million minimum spend!! "we'll make our own!!" cool you got 6/7 million for an initial waffer run after several million to design and test? what if globalfoundries/tsmc/intel decide not to let you use the foundry? you got a few hundred million to build your own kid? 
"oh well we can go back to GPU" same applies there several integration partners who work with AMD/ Nvidia who get an allocation of chips. AMD/Nvidia get their silicon to chip from the same limited number of foundries, repeat argument above.
be a delusional perma bull if you want but this is fact

Maybe you haven't seen an alternative, maybe it will be here soon.
My point was that huge amounts of power goes into bitcoin that does not increase throughput. Your point about bitcoin being decentralised is kind of laughable when it is centralised completely around hardware manufacturers, and the even fewer foundries that produce the asics.

The difficulty in mining is an artificial mechanism and an arbitrary problem though. You're ~~literally~~ figuratively bashing your head against a wall to find a number with enough leading zero's, just to have the right to append a block, validation is still done by nodes. This is by no means a smart nor efficient way to solve the Byzantine problem. Yes it works, but so did pulling carts with horses from point A to B, until the combustion engine was invented. My argument is in this thread is why have we stopped at the horse and cart stage as technologist.

\&gt; crypto exchanges exist because of bitcoin.Lol didnt we have order book trading like 30/40 years ago crypto exchanges are no different to fx trading or stock so that is not innovative technology. In fact most crypto exchanges are sub par to the systems I mentioned.
The power of DLT goes much much much beyond shitty crypto exchanges, and merchants accepting payments. There is a whole world of use cases for DLT/Blockchains which are useful none of which are currently being built on bitcoin.

Exploitability of a system isn't inherently linked to the age of a system, hackers will go after anything with enough widespread adoption or for a high enough value system, there probably isn't hundreds of thousands of machines powering critical infrastructure on AmigaOS. If there were you would see more exploits for it.
Either way there is alot to be said for security through obscurity, so it was a good place to store your coins until you told everyone on reddit that is where they are.

bitcoin has multiple developers working on core, altcoin BCH has 1 (like S2X did)
BCH altcoin is primarily funded and backed by shitmain, so they can continue to use stolen ASICBoost tech to underhandedly handedly mine more blocks
Bitcoin has Larger selection of supporting libraries, clients and systems, compared to altcoin BCH soley really on custodial wallets provided by bitcoin.com and btc.com (owned by bitmain)
Bitcoin Large ecosystem of teams working on alternative scaling solutions, compared to BCH one core developer hardly even committing to BCH core repo (core had 100 commits last week).
BCH altcoin only solution to scaling is to increase blocksize that leads to centralisation of nodes, by making some people unable to run full nodes
So no I wouldn't say BTC is controlled by a select few at all

Well by that logic what benefit is a light client?
You are right to a certain degree the number of nodes is really an arbitrary number, but it is being used as a measuring stick as proof of what is the most popular chain, along with hashrate, signalling and price.
The real issue is with people who are not running full nodes and not understanding the implication of doing so, their thin client could unknowingly be connecting to a s2x node and broadcasting a s2x transaction which is why we have been asking for replay protection

error message is pretty self explanatory, bitcoin cant access the data directory because bitcoin is already running.  
You probably started bitcoin core and closed it haphazardly and the process is still running in the background, go into task manager shut down the process and start again.  
Locking files and directories is common in software engineering so you don't have multiple processes editing the same thing, in this case you wouldn't want two bitcoin core processes trying to write blocks to the data dir at the same time.

ethereum sharding proposals arent the same as what you are describing, but yes you could "shard" the database of blockchain across multiple devices, we have had the technology to shard databases across multiple servers for a long time now while it is more commonly referred to as partitioning, you would just have to implement that in the btc client it's self, from the top of my head levelDB doesnt support partioning so you would have to use another data store that does, or roll your own, and implement it into bitcoind or your own client implementation

A POW change is a knee jerk reaction by people who have not fully thought through the consequences of such a change.
Collectively there is billions invested in mining hardware, them people are not going to altruistically change their mining strategy to accommodate a POW change, they will continue to mine BCH, S2X or some other sha-256 bitcoin fork. With alot of major exchanges and bitcoin services providers saying the BTC ticker will belong to the network with the most accumulative hash power, you will be literally handing the BTC ticker to BCH chode gurglers or S2X banksters which are both more favourable to Jihan Wu.
If there was a POW change it would take large scale co-ordination to be able to ensure enough hash power available to point at BTC when the POW change that would just form new centralisation in a different pattern, and that's assuming ASICS couldn't be developed for the new algo, with bitcoin being so valuable it will always be an attractive option to spend on the R&amp;D to do so.

Does a transaction need to be confirmed in 10mins if you are buying something online? Probably not so you can lower your fee's and wait for the transaction to be included in a block

But I think the reason they have removed the whole concept of webforms from there is because system architecture is becoming more micro service oriented. 
System don't need to be all fully encompassing front to end systems. It is much more common in my experience for systems be built around api's that have zero opinion on front ends. You can then attach what ever front end javascript SPA to your back end API service.

A POW change would be a big final nail in the coffin for the original BTC chain, You would alienate all the miners. Yes bitmain has a monopoly on the production of asics but they are not the majority of the network hash power. 
Doing a POW change would kick all the miners off the network, these people range from thousands invested to millions, you would not see them altruistically change their mining strategy to accommodate GPU's they would go mine BCH or some other sha-256 bitcoin fork, and it has been stated by several large bitcoin companies the true bitcoin will be the one with the most accumulated network hashpower, you would be handing over the BTC ticker to BCH who are a bunch of roger ver chode suckers or S2X banksters.
You would also then leave the network highly insecure, unless you had a large period before hand to co-ordinate people building up enough GPU hash power to point at the btc network to secure it.
The problem is not switching the BTC POW but to stop buying from bitmain, stop mining on their pools, that is what will hurt them the most

They boast their project relies on ternary operators, ternary processors don't exist for every day computing, they are theorised at best. Meaning they just wrap this ternary logic in binary wrappers, IE pointless.

The problem is if there is something on there do you think the guy doing the work is going to send your file back?, if you go down the route of paying someone you will have to tell them what you are looking for, if they find it, theres a negligible chance they will admit it and walk off with the wallet.dat for themselves, you either would have to stand over them, or learn how to do it yourself which might involve investing in some expensive equipment that is fool proof to retrieve the files.

@_date: 2018-04-20 09:22:08
why would shipping data be encrypted? if so how does the company deliver it? yes it might be transmitted via ssl but ultimately the endpoint has plain text access hence you can be de-anonymised.

With  Dave's death he knew he could pull off the scam of the century claiming to be someone with no recourse, as well as  ripping off Daves' family for his estate with the claim.
I don't know Craig personally but know several people who work for him at his London NChain office it is widely spoken and known about from his own employees he's a dumbass who doesn't have the skills or intellect to build something like bitcoin, they also think he's a bit of a creeper.

bitcoin fails hard on 2 of the three points that describe a good currency, therefore it is not, and more like a store of value in which  means the project is already doomed to fail regardless of miners switching off (which goes to prove the point miners are only interested in it as an investment not a vehicle to transact)

This is called the finality of a payment, where someone accepts a payment as complete,
In this example the merchant receiving the payment says 2 blocks must be produced to say your payment is verified, with bitcoin's block-time that's 10minutes, but for two block confirmation is 20 minutes you have to wait to confirm. In comparison Ethereum with a 10 second block-time and 2 block confirmation that's a finality of 20 seconds.
