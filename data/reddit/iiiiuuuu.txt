The block size limit of 1 MB was introduced in 2010. Since then, the Internet bandwidth, computer storage and computation power have increased multiple times. Shouldn't we at least just keep the size not decreasing relatively?

It's not about increasing the blocksize too quickly, we need to just keep it not decreasing relatively.

Just rumors, please ignore any news from a pure speculative market.

No, in China we ban bitcoin everyday.

This is good thing. I think they may increase the delay to 24 hours in case you offline for a long time. And even you confirmed it, it still delayed for 24 hours, you could cancel it in 24 hours.
**The point is you could cancel a withdraw in 24 hours at any time.**

Your link has nothing to do with your title.

Yes, this is mentioned in my post, online wallet like Coinbase could easily implement this service. But our aim is to decentralize and even banks could get hacked.

@_date: 2014-01-22 16:54:13
If it is not feasible in Bitcoin protocol, we could only ask Coinbase to implement it. It's not reverse payment, it's delayed payment.
@_date: 2014-01-22 17:14:46
Banks are fine, decentralized protocol is perfect.

No news, bitstamp down, huobi down. bitstamp up, huobi up

Yes, this is for make the cold storage completely safe. The problem of your approach is you still need to find a safe place for your private key of new address. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:27:55
@_date: 2014-02-23 19:16:20
It's not confirm link, it's cancel link. Even your email got hacked, you could still cancel withdraw.

Price API down.
@_date: 2014-11-10 02:03:06
Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2014-01-22 16:51:17
Not the same, we need an address you can not making normal transactions, you can only making delayed transactions. And you need another private key to cancel it.
@_date: 2014-01-22 16:46:35
The delayed transaction is not considered as a spend, until it exit it's delayed time period, so there will be no chargebacks.
Even cold wallet is not secure enough, many people get hacked. We need to make Bitcoin as secure as possible. No one want their life savings have any possibility to get stolen.

I don't think it's a Tip.Me widget, it's a Tip.Me buttons/badges.  You could find details here 
@_date: 2014-07-02 13:43:55
I mentioned similar idea before. Hope the same delayed withdraw idea could be implemented into bitcoin protocol as well.  
@_date: 2014-01-22 17:12:20
So it is a separate saving account, only put part of your bitcoin in it, keep others in your hot wallet.
@_date: 2014-11-11 05:41:18
Wow! 1000 bits @_date: 2014-01-22 15:59:47
So we need a new kind of address that you can not making a normal transaction on it use private key.

Are you sure it's not a 6,000 buy order? It's unbelievable!

Chinese are faking their GDP, CPI, etc. Bitcoin volumes are really nothing.

This is a volume faking tiny exchange with some tens of volume. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:54:25
 Chinese gov won't allow it.
@_date: 2014-01-22 17:13:28
So I am asking here whether it is feasible in Bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:04:06

What he said is right, but it has nothing to do with current bitcoin pries rise in China. It's due to an on going LTC ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2015-07-10 23:03:44
Believe me, this is not true, I am from China.
@_date: 2015-07-11 02:42:30
I don't think there will be healthy bitcoin market in China in 5 years. But even for now it's still fun to play with this market if they only invest a small amount of money.
@_date: 2015-07-10 22:42:55
An on going LTC ponzi scheme is poping. And some people are trade their LTC for BTC.
@_date: 2015-07-10 23:39:03
This long time trend has nothing to do with china. 
We chinese people only do ponzi and gamble.
@_date: 2015-07-10 23:32:49
The schemer is dumping LTC now, and buying BTC. The time of crash of LTC was the same as the rise of BTC in chinese market.
@_date: 2015-07-10 23:18:18
If you can read chinese you can find all the information from Weibo.com
This ponzi collected 20% of all the LTC ever mined.

Not the same technology, VirtualRealPorn use stereoscopic video, VRGirlz use full body 3D scan. You can navigate in the scene instead of watch a prerecorded video.

This is my idea to solve this problem 
And I am currently thinking a sidechain that provide more secure option but slow on confirmation would be a nice solution.
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:41:16
Why? Even with the AWS and Google Cloud?

"Due to well known reason, BTC China have to temporarily stop RMB deposit function. BTC deposite, withdraw and RMB withdraw function are unaffected. BTC China will continue operation. Please pay attention to our homepage, we will provide other ways to deposit soon in the future. We are sorry for the inconvenience. "

I am Chinese, don't believe the volumes reported by the small exchanges in China. The only credible one is BTCChina. There's no integrity for most small exchanges. This is the reality of current Chinese society, profit over integrity, over everything else.

BTCChina start selling their BTCC Voucher on paipai.com(ebay of Tencent). Someone has already deposited money successfully.
