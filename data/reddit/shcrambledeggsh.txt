I'm pretty sure mtgox is a real corporation with real staff, real lawyers, real laws to obey. The chances of them blatantly stealing from their customers is pretty slim.

Electrum has been messing with their fee calculator. What I'm doing in this most recent version (2.7.18) is setting my preferences [like so]( then moving the slider all the way to the right.

You can go ahead and update, there's no risks involved in doing so (as long as you have your recovery seed phrase)

You'll need a computer with adequate RAM (any less than 1GB would make things pretty slow), and a reasonably fast internet connection.
The ideal setup for newbies is bitcoind on ubuntu. Follow the guides in this thread to add the bitcoin PPA repository, install bitcoind and set up a config file.
You can also install bitcoin-qt and gnome if you want to send and receive coins with the node, but that's a whole other project.

Of course it's recommended that users who store a lot of money on any exchange follow these steps once a month regardless. You're not always going to be notified about leaks/hacks like this one.

Sounds like he had issues with the software/websites he was using. His wallet must have messed up the transaction fee and resulted in a 3 day wait for his 21 BTC, and whatever site he was using must have been allowing 0 confirmation deposits when we had that transaction malleability bug last year.

You have to account for increases in mining difficulty, costs of cooling, maintenance, etc. I'm by no means an expert in BTC mining but I do know that it's not something you can simply work out on a spreadsheet and get a return of exactly 1.8 BTC yearly. You'll want to talk to someone that has a similar mining operation to the one you're planning to set up, ideally in your country.
@_date: 2017-01-30 04:45:59
If there's anything I've learned from using exchanges it's that you want to get your money off the exchange and into a hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger), otherwise client-sided wallet (blockchain.info, electrum, Bitcoin QT, etc.), or even a paper wallet as soon as possible. Securing your Bitcoin means controlling your own private keys and making sure that whatever device is storing those private keys will not be hacked. Storing your coins on an exchange means the exchange has your private keys and therefore has full control over your money.
In other words it doesn't matter so much which exchange you use, Bitfinex is best for liquidity/trading, Coinbase/GDAX or Gemini for legitimacy. Just pick one, get verified, get your coins and transfer them to a safe place.

Do not by any means drop your whole live savings into Bitcoin at this price. You are gonna want to spread that shit out over years ideally. If I were you I would look to get some coins in the $700-800 range over the next 6 months.

If you are checking the price constantly you probably want to reduce your investment/use less margin. Gotta be comfortable with your investments before you will make money imo.

Generally people aren't pulling these numbers out of nowhere, rather, they come from asking questions like "What if Bitcoin had the same transaction volume and throughput as Visa or Mastercard?"

The blockchain can fork, but in the end there can only be one main chain, and the rest of the forks will be left as "orphans". Like others mentioned, the 100 confs is to prevent miners from spending coins from orphaned chains.

Can confirm the banks are not having any of our shit. I got banned from my Canadian bank (TD Canada Trust) after a deposit (Bitcoin transaction) was deemed "suspicious" and "potentially fraudulent".

It's only a casino if you use an irresponsible amount of leverage, just because they provide 20x doesn't mean you should use it.

What is he even talking about? "Wall Street Put" level? Minimum investment threshold? ELI5?
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:45:59
Here's the thing right.. you buy BTC, claim the transaction was fraudulent, the BTC cannot be refunded, your bank is stuck refunding your transaction out of pocket while still letting it go through to the other side. 
In other words, BTC creates a real problem for banks, you will need to get multiple bank accounts. Keep one backup account that doesn't touch crypto at all.
Expect to run into issues. Crypto is a disruptive technology.

Nah you missed the bus. Long term, sure, short term, if you're gonna buy now you had better sell very soon if you want to ensure that you make some profit or at least break even.

2a) is covered by specified foreign property I believe..
@_date: 2017-05-15 03:59:13
Yeah well that's Canada so I'm not sure how much it applies. But the CRA did say Bitcoin is considered foreign property if it's held outside of Canada. Confusing stuff.
Actually I misunderstood your post, I think if you transfer out of an exchange into your own wallet you could claim that it's no longer yours and elect to not pay taxes on it.
Anyway though for most of this tax stuff it's your responsibility to declare everything correctly and if it's found to be wrong you get penalized.
