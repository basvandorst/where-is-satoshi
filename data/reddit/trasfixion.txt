No, anyone with a brain isn’t hoping to cash out, they’re hoping for crypto to take over the banking system and be used as a currency

Thanks for actually giving me an answer instead of downvoting me for no reason

You downvote me for asking a question? We don’t need people like you on Reddit

I wouldn’t say Bitcoin was never anonymous, in fact, Bitcoin was very anonymous before exchanges enforced KYC.
You’re able to track what Bitcoin was sent so what wallet, but it was impossible to tie a wallet with a person, especially before exchanges existed. Now however, Bitcoin can be traced to you since most people are verified on at least one exchange or purchasing site like CoinBase.

Both should be legal. This is supposed to be the land of the free. Every day they are being slowly taken from us though

There’s a conspiracy theory that the government is run by a bunch of shape shifting reptiles; of course that theory is ridiculous. There is only one reptile, and she has never tried to hide her identity as if she was human.

There are people who want Bitcoin to become the new gold, and for those people, more regulation legitimizes bitcoin.
Then there are people who have the same mentality of the cypher punk group, and they are very opposed to regulation, and see it as defeating the purpose of Bitcoin.
I fall somewhere in the middle, maybe leaning toward the second.

I love my Country. I love our history of fighting for freedom. I love how we were truly the freest country in the world.
I hate our legislators, I hate our government, I hate our banks. I hate how we are no longer the freest nation, I hate how our government has to stick their noses into everything we do.
I love my country, which is why I will fight for its freedom.

The whole reason for the fork was that a few miners didn't want Segwit and wanted to increase block size instead. If BCH added Segwit, it would mean the fork was for nothing..... well I guess the fork was for nothing anyways lol

LTC is trying to work with BTC to dominate together, so that works well. BCH is trying to take down Bitcoin, LTC is BTCs friend lol

Yeah yeah yeah, but it’s one year. Holding bitcoin for the last 12 months would have been insanely profitable. It’s not like we are talking about 5 years

That’s not true at all. Why not look at who signed the NYA in the first place 
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:27:50
Why not keep small blocks, keep it as decentralized as possible, and implement layer 2 solutions. We already have SegWit (which isn’t even fully running yet), and the lighting network on the way.
There are other ways to speed up and cheaper transactions without increasing block size 
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:30:19
BCH is extremely centralized right now

I truly hope Coinbase turns around and says FU to 2X
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:47:49
True, but at that point would you have done better just buying Bitcoin to begin with? Probably

B2X is a trash coin
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:47:19
The blocksize debate isn’t just about blocksize. There are more nefarious things going on.
And about blocksize, why would we risk another fork and continued confusion for new investors when we haven’t even given SegWit a chance to work yet? Shouldn’t we see how effective SegWit is before jumping on the next fork bandwagon?
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:32:28
We don’t need the government to protect us. If Coinbase wants to have 2x coin with no replay protection, we will know, and we have the choice to keep our coins on Coinbase, or to move them off coinbase.
No need for legal action to muddy the waters. If they do this, they will lose millions of customers, and they’ll have a mass exodus. So they either do what’s right, or screw themselves. I say, let them make their choice

He’s against 2X. May have been a misunderstanding 
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:38:14
Agree with everything except the “sue” part. We don’t need Governments to save us. Bitcoin is supposed to be above banks and governments. If bitcoin needs the government to save us, then we aren’t as amazing as we are supposed to be

The way the Federal Reserve bank and Central banks around the world are printing money with no solid backing, we will have a global Zimbabwe or Venezuela crisis eventually.

Think about what you said. Maybe this is a direct attack on BTC. Maybe there are people behind the curtains pulling the strings to try to take down BTC

This is exactly the reason. Happened with the Bitcoin Cash fork, happened with the Bitcoin Gold fork, and is Happening now with 2x. Once the forks are done, I expect BTC to pull back and alts to go on a run, but I believe BTC will only pull back so far, and will still be higher than when it started
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:26:37
Many people think like you, and that's why it will never go to zero. I may be wrong, but this looks like a huge correction from such a spike earlier this year. I think it'll all work out in the end.

Larger blocks increase centralization. Keeping Bitcoin at 1mb ensures it stays decentralized
