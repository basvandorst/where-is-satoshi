Ah ok, sorry. There are a lot of people spouting nonsense (on both BTC and BCH sides) and my approach has been to call them out in a direct but polite, non-confrontational way and see what their response is.
I see you're not one of those people.
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:50:17
Because people will pay it
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:08:50


Just curious, how do you know that? How much of the specification have you read yourself? What you are saying sounds like the other side of the coin that the BCH crew regurgitate.

Not related to fees, but yesterday it took 5 hours for a transaction of mine (out of an exchange, fee I can't control of 0.006 BTC) to be confirmed (for a single confirmation). That's not acceptable for mainstream use.
If adoption increases and BTC-to-fiat value rises, the fees will become untenable as it stands today. Also, the mempool would be massively backlogged in it's current form.
I really would like to see bitcoin succeed as a currency, but the current fees and tx throughput really need to be scaled to reach mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:01:31
The above average inflation might also drive the price down, reducing the incentive to mine compared to BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:23:57
Yeah, I made a similar comment elsewhere 
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:29:05
I found this video useful as a primer to get the basics of LN 
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:27:18
One price is what it's trading at (3551.94), the other is what coinbase is selling it at (3597.39).
The difference is called the spread 
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:15:32
My hope is that if LNs prove to be innovative and useful it will take a lot of traffic off the chain, reducing demand and lowering the price.
It would be nice if we then had a situation where on-chain tx's still cost more than off-chain, but the lowered demand and need for them results in a more affordable price.
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:07:22
What are you pointing out with the fork.lol link? BCH tx's are low, with a spike around Aug 16, I think someone was testing out the block size then.
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:26:10
But currently, BCH has had 3 blocks in the last 9.5 hours. BTCs mempool gets affected, and the BCH block rate stalls. I don't think anyone can really say BCH is dead or a success.
Both issues result in massive delays to tx confirmations but in different ways. At least with BTC you get the option to compete in the mempool (at a large cost) to be included, where as with BCH you current have no option.

lol, wait for the EDA to kick in, it's likely to cause a few issues...
@_date: 2017-09-26 08:04:27
I export the master public key when I generate the HD wallet seed and keep that on my computer. Then I can see all my transactions in Electrum as normal, I just can't send.
I haven't done it yet, but with electrum I can create a transaction, save it to USB. Then CD boot an offline computer, import the private key and sign the transaction and send it out on the regular computer.
There are some potential points for security compromise, but it's generally a secure procedure, if a bit cumbersome.

Nothing. I'm sure people have been trying for years, but apparently no one has yet been able to.
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:46:53
I should have used `-printtoconsole` after the upgrade, that would have pointed out what was happening.
@_date: 2017-09-26 13:04:29
That's true. If I made regular transactions I'd get one, but I rarely do so can't be bothered with the cost.

That was "satoshi's vision" right?

Is there a video link to this talk? I've wondered before about per-block re-targeting, and naively/ignorantly thought that a per-block trailing average sounds reasonable.
I would be interested to hear proper analysis on the subject. I'd also be keen to hear the same person judge the mechanics and consequences of Bitcoin Cash's EDA.

EDIT: I've just run with `-reindex` which has got it going, but was hoping to avoid doing it.

Their argument to this is usually something like: "That's fine the price just needs to double and it won't be an issue"
It's madness.
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:46:51
The BCH mempool gets cleared every block ( BCH just doesn't have enough transactions to create a blocksize of greater than 1MB.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:53:59
I think everyone who holds any non-BTC coin thinks it will boom, and personally, I think they're probably wrong. For something to overtake BTC, then BTC will probably need to crash, and if BTC crashes, everything else will probably go with it.
edit: also, if people choose a coin because "I can buy a whole one" then they are very misguided.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:18:13
This is the kind of response I see in r/btc. Ignoring the points being made and telling the poster their not in "reality".
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:41:48
Some believe that miners will work at a loss in long term self-interest, on a chain that is less profitable now, but more suited to their mining toolset (ASIC farms). Core's road map (LNs) marginalises their role, and the potential for a POW change could also be a disincentive.
I don't know how much this factors into total hashrate though.

But the issue as I see it is there's absolutely no interest in a size increase, even if there's minimal risk or issues. Much community fracture could be alleviated by even hinting that a (minimal) size increase is being considered. But that doesn't appear to be the case.
Having said that, I completely understand that it is by no means a real long-term scaling solution, other methods will **have** to be found. But, if it's not dangerous, it seems stubborn to not be open to working towards that too.
I understand that as block size increases less people can run nodes and the cost of the system increases, but there are already many people in the world who cannot run nodes as it stands. Where is the line drawn? It seem arbitrary at the moment.


Yeah, they're a joke, believe me, I'm no fan of theirs. I've spent a while posting in r/btc and I'm probably one of the most hated people there. I constantly point out the issues they have and I get shit on non-stop for it.


Absolutely not. Looking at the repos for BCH and 2x, I'm not impressed, they're clearly just hackjobs on top of BTC.


Can you quantify that? The data I see doesn't appear to support those statement.
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:23:43
I feel the same way. For now I've started watching the github projects of bitcoin and the wallets I use. I've also subscribed to the [bitcoin-dev mailing list](
While these often provide way more info than I want, it can be useful to get cutting edge information (e.g. when your wallet supports segwit)
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:31:35


But the mempool is currently at 60,000+ unconfirmed transactions. I know this is due to the BCH EDA shenanigans, but I don't personally consider this acceptable.


I agree, but why is it not even considered at the moment? All of the power that the 2x fork has could be taken away by publishing a roadmap of a (even modest) block size increase. It doesn't *have* to be at the behest of shitty forks and corporate interests if core would do it themselves in a steady, planned and tested fashion.
I don't want some weak fork from a single dev to derail the codebase of bitcoin. But it seems to me that if core said "yes, we're going to increase block size by 1-2 MB", then there wouldn't be any dispute and it could be done properly.
Unless I'm missing something, it's always stated as "this will be done in the future". It seems priorities are amiss when a simple (and unless I'm wrong, safe) change could be done now, and users are saddled with larger fees while waiting on optimisations to come, that don't even have a clear road map.
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:21:55


I dread to think. I couldn't imagine being a mod without someone paying me to do it.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:51:34
It seemed obvious to me.
There is clearly a conflict of interest when people who have the power to avoid addressing one problem (full capacity blocks) are also completely open about charging fees for their own proprietary solution ([monthly fees, TX fees](
Now, I completely understand the issues surrounding block increases. As they get bigger, overall cost increases and trust and security will generally decrease. However, it's also very convenient to state those issues when you are also selling a patented solution that you intend to charge for.
Even if in reality there isn't a conflict of interest (blockstream don't represent all of the core team), it looks very questionable from an outsiders perspective.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:34:59
My history is mostly spent criticising BCH in r/btc, so I think I've seen the worst of the worst, I thought other places would be better. That's a shame.

haha, bollocks. Should have read the release notes first. It's on a HP microserver so will probably take ages.

I understand. I see the parallels with open source software where the core product is open and free, and the extra features and support are an additional product.


I agree. And I don't think it's desirable. I personally don't want every single little TX of mine on a global ledger anyway (what would the wife say :) ).


Yeah, I agree. From what I've seen of the BCH and 2x repos, it looks like the absolute minimal amount of work has gone into making the required changes. You can see my comments on this topic [here]( if you're bored enough to read it.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:57:00

I did [suggest it](
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:25:21
I think it is a risk. Someone who has such a disproportionately large share could cause a massive crash the BTC price.
They could also effectively control inflation indirectly by releasing large amounts of coin at certain times. I've read the satoshi wallet has at least 1 million bitcoin in it, that's nearly 5% of all BTC that will ever exist. This could potentially be put onto the market to top up the diminishing coin rewards, skewing the predicted inflation level.
@_date: 2017-09-23 22:55:37
Currently it seems to be only a crude combination of devs attempting soft and hard forks based on their proposals, users voting with their transactions and miners voting with their hash power.
It would be nice to have something a bit more predictable or formal, but I guess in these early times it's rough terrain.
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:50:16


Can you elaborate on this? What would you say to a user who is unhappy with multi-dollar TX fees at this moment in time? They would say it's very much needed.


Then why don't core roll out a minor increase they approve of and lower fees for a year or so until LNs are ready?
@_date: 2017-09-23 22:49:48
Only if the community agree, I hope. I know the BCH crew oppose (to put it mildly) the core devs, but I hope people don't blindly lap up what the devs propose, like BCH do their miners.
edit: "if a change makes sense", guess that answers my own point, really.
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:28:17
Somehow I've avoided that list.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:47:48
Thanks for the kind reply, I'll take a look when I have the time. Would be good to get another point of view away from the toxicity of r/btc.
Do other crypto subs show opinion on r/btc? If so what is the consensus? I post there to have my ideas challenged, but my opinion is they are are mostly diehard bigblockers who will fiercely reject any dissenting opinion. I couldn't tell you how many times I've been called a blockstream core shill, even though I've clearly criticised BTC/core on several occasions. Any critical thought is smashed with downvotes and abusive replies.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:05:23


Looking at blockchair and blockexplorer, nearly all the blocks are above 900k. It doesn't appear that miners are mining very many half empty blocks at all.


I understand that, and I appreciate taking a conservative approach. But you said:


So I'm asking, if it is indeed fine, when why can't core approve a minor increase in size until LNs are more firmly established.
@_date: 2017-09-25 23:19:16


For that reason, I'm going to upvote it.
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:49:12
Whoever would do it would be putting the nail in the coffin. I guess while there's sweet, sweet EDA juice to be had it won't happen. Looking at the graphs I see a steady movement from BCH to BTC, but the USD price is relatively steady. I wonder if people are slowly dumping it for BTC and incoming buyers are propping up the USD price.
It's a shame the security of the coin has dropped so low, I feel bad for people who went all in and are now in such a risky position. Although, if the loudest members of are anything to go by it's apparently a non-issue.
