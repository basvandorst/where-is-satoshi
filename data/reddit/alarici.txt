Namecheap is great! I should pay more attention to Cyber Monday next year. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:11:00
Nice, will download today. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:49:56
Your dog and I are quite similar. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 01:27:06
Never heard of this until today, but I'm absolutely intrigued and excited about Augur!
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:09:46
Ha, I got certified when it first came out. Just thought it was a cool thing to pay a couple dollars for and test my knowledge. Good stuff!
@_date: 2014-09-14 03:07:57
Why is it better than BitWallet? I feel like BitWallet is just supereasy to set up and send some Bitcoin to friends and family.

[The digital homeless is now a thing]( Thanks Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:33:54
Fantastic video!
@_date: 2014-08-23 23:16:57
Are you getting paid to constantly hate on Vertcoin? Relax dude. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 17:27:04
@_date: 2014-10-18 16:03:04
I'm really excited about this! I think I'm going to work with my linux box today and mess around with OpenBazaar!
@_date: 2014-12-19 02:27:56
A lot of homeless actually aren't homeless. I just ran across this on the Internet a while back and thought it was funny. I can see how the title is misleading (I, for one, am quite the opposite of homeless).

I just signed up for Circle this morning! My $10 in BTC has gone up! 
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:58:15
I will start one.  I've made my way over from the alternative coin community and would like to take a more active role in Bitcoin agenda.  I was looking to form my own SuperPAC during SOPA so I'm familiar with the paperwork needed.  I'll get going on it this weekend.

@_date: 2014-10-15 23:31:34
Looks great! No complaints. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 23:32:41
Downloaded the G+ app and joined as well! 
@_date: 2014-09-19 22:12:48
Happy cake day matey! Never turn down a bit!
@_date: 2014-08-24 02:45:14
Damn lost $1500, :( [I'm here for you, bro](
@_date: 2014-08-23 15:50:36
Love your interface! Bookmarked.  
  
  
Shout out to Betcoinpoker.com. It's awesome, just needs more players!
@_date: 2014-08-24 02:40:08
Look at the big picture. Look at your life. Really? Let's try to be optimistic about the future. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 15:41:24
I cannot wait until my friends and family feel the same way about it as I do. Until then, I will continue hanging out here and talking with others about it!
@_date: 2014-09-02 04:24:07
Awesome! I bought a USB PCI-e Card from newegg this weekend using Bitcoin as well. Loved just holding my phone up to scan a QR code, making the payment. Fantastic stuff :)
@_date: 2014-09-18 15:46:22
Even if you buy a little Bitcoin with each paycheck it's okay to be upset with the price drops. That's your hard earned money failing, so it's natural even if you know of the risk involved. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:08:21
Thanks for the link, this needs to be more well known.
@_date: 2015-05-25 13:04:09
Has anyone completed the University of Nicosia MOOC and if so, would you recommend it? Also, do you think that a non-programming cryptocurrency degree would ever hold any weight anywhere? I love online learning and am seriously considering it, but thinking that a more reputable school may have a degree program soon. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 15:37:55
Really cool! How difficult was it to make? Would it be possible to make it battery powered so I can mount on my wall? 
@_date: 2014-09-19 19:41:44
Watched the first one, great elocution of great points. Well done!
@_date: 2015-05-24 23:45:20
If Amazon accepted Bitcoin for Kindle format... 
@_date: 2015-05-25 14:38:57
Sorry! [MSc in Digital Currency](
@_date: 2015-05-27 21:49:30
Looks really interesting!
@_date: 2015-01-28 01:32:31
Hi :) why not? [homelessontheinternet.com](
@_date: 2015-01-28 02:45:43
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-05-25 23:11:30
Thanks, remind me when I have to change my password again. :)
@_date: 2016-01-27 00:40:26
I'm certainly ready to put all this drama behind us!
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:43:50
There's numerous Bitcoin exchanges that would enjoy your business. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:55:59
Definitely. A lot of my coworkers and friends are open to the idea, they just have no clue why Bitcoin has me so excited. I do my best to put it into terms that anyone can understand. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 14:42:59
I'm probably going to buy some gold and silver to diversify a bit, but I'd rather a majority of my investments be in things I believe in. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:19:18
Why shouldn't it be, though? 
@_date: 2016-06-17 00:40:51
Really depends on what you're trying to do with it. Hodl long term or short?
@_date: 2016-06-04 21:19:35
I think it already has.
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:49:04
Yeah, if they are interested, I'll have them download a wallet and I'll send a few bits their way. Two of my friends now have Coinbase accounts and buy Bitcoin themselves. It's pretty cool to see this happening. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 21:15:09
I enjoy pin/password protecting all outgoing transactions. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 13:34:57
This really makes me want to get a Raspberry Pi. That is awesome! 
@_date: 2016-06-04 21:18:52
No one will ever truly know. However, I'm along for the ride.
@_date: 2016-12-04 07:28:14
That's beautiful. Hope to see more of these around the world!
@_date: 2016-11-25 04:55:09
Buy high, sell low?
@_date: 2016-12-08 05:44:31


@_date: 2016-12-08 06:23:15
Good link, thank you. Your comment was confusing, as Bitcoin had not been invented yet, but I see what you mean now. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 20:04:20
Thanks! Will be tipping soon!
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:12:48
Nice Post
@_date: 2015-08-26 06:34:38
Just got my email, now what do I do?!
@_date: 2015-07-18 01:15:39
Love the heat sink off to the side. Really cool!

Do you work in the finance industry? What was your purpose for taking this program? I'm kind of interested but have no ambition of working in finance or being a programmer. 
@_date: 2016-09-13 05:19:48
Bought it from [shirtwascash]( 
@_date: 2016-09-17 06:17:06
Big if true.
@_date: 2016-09-24 05:28:14
Yes, I'm working on getting a company started right now. I want OpenBazaar to be the main selling platform!
@_date: 2016-09-12 19:17:04
I have this printed on a shirt. I like that shirt.
@_date: 2015-04-04 18:31:51
Thank you! Great performance last night, I love that song by BANKS! 
@_date: 2015-04-22 01:19:14
I'm wondering if I can buy a $100 brick from the Planetary Society with Bitcoin. I might just do that  
@_date: 2015-09-25 23:51:32
That's a bit sensationalist; I'm guessing they didn't even bother. 
@_date: 2015-09-18 13:52:50
@_date: 2015-04-04 00:20:40
Rock on dude, and good luck!
@_date: 2015-09-16 01:24:08
This is outstanding, I hope it succeeds (and maybe write something for it in the future)! 
@_date: 2015-09-03 21:46:46
I, too, do things for the accolades. I'm in.
@_date: 2015-09-25 23:52:59
That is slick. Bookmarked.
@_date: 2015-11-04 00:23:52
It's pretty sexy to watch!
@_date: 2015-11-12 20:50:39
I honestly just have my friends download a phone wallet app then I send them $5-$10. If they want to know more, I'll teach them more. 
@_date: 2015-11-15 00:17:44
So my account didn't increase 156.797% since the last time I logged in!?  
  
I'm also removing all my orders for $3.00 a bitcoin hoping someone would erroneously type that instead of $300. ;)  
@_date: 2015-03-07 16:53:05
But this is like saying "I hid my cash, now I can't find it." Only instead of cash, he could have put his key in multiple locations...
@_date: 2015-10-04 17:55:52
Very cool and hilarious. Great website and video. Good luck!
@_date: 2015-11-22 15:05:01
That's good stuff, best of luck to you!
@_date: 2015-11-11 17:13:12
I love you this post made me lol! nice post! 
@_date: 2015-10-23 23:47:30
This is amazing, why have I not heard of this? I would like to Beta Test please! :)
@_date: 2015-11-10 19:24:52
I agree, and even now it's pseudo-anonymous, which is pretty awesome.
@_date: 2015-10-29 00:31:48
Just downloaded, looks beautiful. Nice work @_date: 2015-11-26 13:04:09
Obviously because I sold and life hates me. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 01:35:20
Will definitely use this, keep us in the loop!
@_date: 2015-10-16 20:42:39
I wonder where it will land and stick? Trading Bitcoin is exciting and I give credit to those that can do it successfully. I am not one of them. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 23:32:55
Very neat, I just bookmarked it for when I go live on OB. Danke!
@_date: 2015-10-06 22:30:49
Glad I withdrew yesterday. Wow.
@_date: 2016-05-31 13:51:04
Yeah, I have it in multiple places as well, and I'm trying to consolidate a bit and making sure it will be easy to access. I want it to be difficult for someone to physically steal but easy enough for my family to put together the pieces. 
@_date: 2016-05-21 20:37:09
Cool stuff, I subscribed! I think tips are awesome and I would love to start throwing a few cents to writers/bloggers that I like.
@_date: 2016-05-22 22:37:57
Awesome! You should consider recording your lectures and putting them on the web. A youtube series would be really cool. 
@_date: 2016-05-31 13:29:18
This is crazy to me and an excellent way to read up on Bitcoin. I have high hopes for a borderless currency taking over in my lifetime. 
@_date: 2016-07-10 14:47:24
You bring up a great point that people don't seem to talk about much around here. I would love to be able to mine Bitcoin as a hobby but those days have long past. I can only see increased competition in the sector, stability, and increased interest in Bitcoin driving the prices of ASICs down. Until then, it's going to remain centralized. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:51:02
Seems like it, he said something along the lines of "Bitcoin never was meant to be used for buying things" which I find ridiculous.  
@_date: 2017-06-10 11:44:37
Really? Digital currency was never meant for buying things? Currency. Not for buying things. Okay.    
Edit: Good job editing your post to something completely different.
@_date: 2016-07-31 09:33:05
A casino is one of Bit Bastion's main selling points? How about any sort of infrastructure and maybe SOME form of governance. Sounds like a cool idea, I just think it would be horribly executed.
