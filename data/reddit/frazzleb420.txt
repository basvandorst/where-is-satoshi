Well you obviously don't know 'plenty', plus you're overly arsey about your ignorance too.
I'm not listing all the points because it's a Friday and I just finished work haha. There's plenty of material around for to read, I'm sure you don't need me to regurgitate it all for you...
Err a lot of early investors DIDN'T benefit... Some lost out massively, you can't keep trying to paint what was a genuinely new &amp; innovative technology as a 'ponzi', just because that's the nearest think you know of to help you understand.
Bitcoin has gone up in value for all kinds of reasons, including the fact it's based on blockchain, as well as supporting crazy amounts of transactions, with a focus on decentralisation, and anonymity. (Ofc the blockchain is public, who owns what address isn't un less you make it so). All investors can make money as with trust comes value, and so if the tech progresses / stays innovative, then that brings value. Not to mention the rate of adoption by other people.
If you want to have a btc pissing match, I mined mine when it was under a few hundred dollars, and sold at £12k. So what? And who cares about your grandma? What your talking about is just the affect the media has on the market, slowly permeating further and further into the mainstream, until it hits yo grandma.
Bitcoin may not be the best crypto around, or best investment, or good at all in your opinion. It is not a ponzi though.

Perhaps, but tbh I'd be more ok with this if they edited the title once they got the upvotes (like over 1000? idk...) 
It's a cool piece of art, and deserves recognition, but now I know it's not banksy, the title's driving me mad...

You clearly don't understand bitcoin, altcoins, or cryptocurrencies generally...
