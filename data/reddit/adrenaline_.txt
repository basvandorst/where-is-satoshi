You might want to actually *read* the discussions I've had on Bitcoin without jumping to conclusions.
I do like how you don't apply the same bias against cpujockey.  Maybe because you only apply the label "troll" to people who disagree with you instead of to people who react to a calm difference in opinion with rudeness and insults?
What are you going for here?  Again, feel free to actually read the arguments I've made against Bitcoin and reserve your judgement for them, instead of my reactions to the true troll, @_date: 2014-05-13 16:41:03
I came in here because this thread was created by a troll *about me*.
Is this over your head?  I tend to respond to my accusers, especially when they are assholes like cpujockey.
I linked to the *comments section* of his picture because the first comment was dead on.  Again, context doesn't seem to be your strong suit.
I love that you continue to be a complete jackass though.  It just proves that you're just deadset on jumping in and being a dick.  Haha, man I really feel bad for you.
As a reminder, [this is how adults talk to each other](  You should grow up and learn.

It's come down to an eye for an eye against that guy, yea.  If is going to be a dick, then he should be surprised when I laugh at him.

You just don't stop, do you?  Just like a bully.
Yes, there are at least two people for every debate.  What's your point?  All you've done since butting in has been to apply judgement without context.  It's sad.
Pot, you need to stop calling the kettle black.  You might want to actually understand how context works, and how if someone belittles you and is rude to you enough, you're going to eventually have enough.  This was the case with cpujockey.
Move along, kid.  I linked you to how I debate with people who act like adults (unlike you).  If someone wants to act childish instead (you / cpujockey), they will be treated like a child and laughed at for acting that way.  
Your bias and purposeful rejection of context is palpable, and I feel bad for your inability to see more than 1 step forward.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if you and cpujockey were the same person.

[Oh god, this is funny as hell.  Thanks for the laugh.  I'm not even mad at you anymore :-)  I just feel bad now.](

I could have done that to the reply before mine, as well.  We were both writing long arguments.  No big deal.  TL;DR would have been a fine response, but it would have showed he didn't care as much as he initially led on.

Pot calling the kettle black much?
You called me childish, an asshole, a troll, and so on.
Maybe you need to invest in those mirrors you're so fond of.
If you posted your picture on Reddit and asked people to give their first impression, and the first impression was that you're a little keyboard warrior who butts in to make himself feel better because he is lacking something in his life, I'd link to it and laugh.  Yes.
Man, you're hopeless.  Have a good one, bud.  I'll allow you to have the last word, as it's clearly important to you ;-)

It's strange that you don't realize that chat makes you look like an ass.
@_date: 2014-05-13 15:06:33
Yes, and people are allowed to have opinions as to why Bitcoin is harmful to consumers without being treated poorly for having that opinion.
@_date: 2014-05-13 16:20:55
Have a nice day, bud.  I really hope you do some self-reflection sometime and realize you're just being a bully right now.
@_date: 2014-05-13 15:04:58
Well, the first thing would be to read it and then address the points.  We were both making long arguments.
You, on the other hand, just throw temper tantrums when people disagree.
I like how you are being a child by creating a new post about this though.  Grow up.
@_date: 2014-05-13 16:32:16
[This is how mature people debate.](
You might want to take some notes.  Are you done being a jerk for no reason?
@_date: 2014-06-27 20:49:13
His response was rude and unnecessary.  He decided to be mean to someone and then got all pissy when they were mean back.  Then he decided to lecture them, which is very pretentious.
Over at he is being downvoted for this actually, so I know I'm not alone.

It's definitely possible.  I used to take generic design specs from Excel and automatically create the G-Code to create snowboard core, sidewall, and inserts.  Hell, I'd be happy to do this too for a small cut.
@_date: 2013-12-16 13:39:45
Why can't you do it?
