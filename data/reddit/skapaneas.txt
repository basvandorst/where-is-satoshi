You don't understand how tough is to survive at Greece at this point. I sympathize Andreas he is the guy that saved my life literately with his preaching.
Roger veer owes him a big pie of the hype that is created for Bitcoins and all the money he made. It is because of people like Andreas.

there are better techs out there like ethereum's platform
I just check for news that might pump btc prices and thats it.
I don't think bitcoins tech is something new anymore it was a beta blockchain I am quite sure better ones will emerge eventually sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2015-12-24 09:40:42
sure thing.
Bitcoin as we all know is a very scarce unit. only 21000000 will be ever exist.
today there are ~15000000 btc if every human being was to flip their fiat currencies over to btc in one day that would result the biggest spike in price you would have ever seen in anything with a value. as a result to that now every human on this planet would be extremely rich depended their % on btc .that would result for the global debt from countries towards banks to be 0 since now everyone can afford to repay their debts back to banks.something that banks really dont want to see happening.
that is dangerous because banks do not care of being the richest entities on the planet (they already are) they want to control countries over their debt towards those global financial institutions. 
so they aim for power rather than more money since more money does not make sense when you already have more than you will ever need.
this in my opinion will result to bankers using their power wherever is applicable to control those that haven't got out of their debt. resulting to major conflicts all over the world,but not as a ww3 rather than a war towards terrorism since a decentralized global society its a actually an act of terrorism towards banking system from the people.
I don't think banks will win that war though they will eventually perish not because of their luck of power but because they will be irrelevant to global trading eventually noone will need them not even governments. since those will decentralized in the end.
thats the final act of decentralization 
TL;DR A global decentralized society has no need for central institutions.banks will eventually perish.
@_date: 2015-12-23 22:07:35

if ppl think that the price of bitcoin will be cheaper than my weapon skin in tf2 for ever I am sure we still have time to purchase cheap bitcoins at least for another year.until reality hits them up and they jump on the train too.
they will be late but they will still be the heart of the party.

Ethereum reached a consensus to fork out of the former bad/infected chain, There for it was an agreement between the investors to vote for the changes. Calling ethereum classic the real Ethereum chain is a bit stupid since the real ethereum investors have disregarded the faulty chain and moved on to a superior chain, At least they mt.gox equilivent event of dropping some billions worth of coins tanking the market is not an option for the Eth hackers it stands in a better ground for the future than bitcoin does in its current state... If every bitcoin hacker tried to dump their shit on the exchanges btc would worth 100$ by the end of the year. That was the reason we didn't want the hacker in our ecosystem and we fork the hell out of it. We simple have to protect our investments and Ethereum at least is able to do that, I am not saying bitcoin is not any good. It did fund the Ethereum chain so we have to respect that and protect the Bitcoin as much as we did with Eth but it is a secondary now. I hope bitcoin can survive all that shit and be the coin it used to be. Eth is not made to compete any currency it is made to change the world of online payments and finance work, Bitcoin still does not know what it wants to be when it grow up, a currency or a store of value. It is good to have a business plan or at least a roadmap to where you want to be in some years from now, Bitcoin still have not figure this out. And for sure it wont going to be able to compete at smart contracts anywhere near the coming years. It is already out of the game and for me the community should really focus on making bitcoin space a bit clearer than that. When I send bitcoin from a service to my wallet I expect to get btc and not some shit forked thing I never asked for, and yes this has happened to me 1 month ago after purchasing the advcash card. No one will ever take you serious if you practice such stupid things to customers. Just saying.

Well some of the shiny weapons I buy for cs:go right now are more expensive than bitcoin.. I guess I am fine with it I will probably sell a couple of them to buy 3-4 bitcoins if it drop more.
People really have no sense of values. whoever is selling bitcoin these days shouldn't own them to begin with. We will be way stronger holding without them is my guess.
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:18:45
So Eth is an altcoin to bitcoin because they share the same &lt;your answer goes here&gt;

Sure but investing to a 1080 for an African is like buying a house for me... Check their monthly salaries.

Also a side note why the hell would I want to be anonymous to do anything? I get tax reductions the more I spend.

I can't stress enough how stupid this is.at any level.

Good luck ordering anything online and send it at an address to pick it up then.

He didn't sold his shares. He find a window on the law to hedge them to his wife so she wouldn't have to pay taxes after his death. Steve jobs was the greatest asshole of all times but a great marketer, he could sell you a dollar for a bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:23:54
I don't really care about bitcoin, I think owning just 1 is enough for a lifetime and I am done with that minimum since years.

If you want to track to terrorists you don't start with the buyers. Just saying.
It is way more efficient to go with monitoring the sellers...

Gold is vulnerable to its elitist and cartel like markets is way more centralized than crypto and the majority of it belongs to the 1&amp; I personally will never support any value that is used to fund wars fund elites and cartels.
@_date: 2018-04-14 07:13:14
It is harder to track cash transactions. I bet that crypto will help actually to track terrorists down better than any fiat would.
@_date: 2018-04-14 07:26:00
if the only place to buy p2p currency will be exchanges theres no point holding something that cannot do the single thing it is designed to do.

I wanna see you return a warranty back that way dude. 
Anonimity is not going to cut it in financial services. It seems to me people have no idea what they are talking about. 
Also buying a house or a car anonymous plan a trip buying air tickets 
this subreddit is kinda delusional.
@_date: 2015-11-26 11:58:29
well if its safe for ISIS its safe for...
What do they really expect to achieve with that kind of propaganda?if anything idiotic statements like this only makes stronger the safety feel the bitcoin buyer feels for his investment.
In a sidenote where can I purchase a tank with my bitcoins?

I inspired this type of model back in 2007 there where no tools available back then.
The blockchain changed that we live in the begining of a new era. wasn't expecting this to happen in my life time.
the future is now.

Idk buddy in greece the only way I have to send money for worldwide transactions is the bitcoin.
so in my case bitcoin is more reliable than any bank at the moment.
@_date: 2018-04-20 08:55:48
So I guess you have not experienced losses from chargeback with some random guy on the internet walking away with your products and your cash yet.
@_date: 2015-11-26 12:36:34
since bitcoins circulation is $5.5B I say no.
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:43:35
thanks for this I didn't knew it.
@_date: 2015-11-20 11:23:25
it takes 1 brain cell to believe this scenario.
and about a billion of them to laugh your ass off.
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:36:09
You talk bullshit. The sole reason I am into bitcoin since 2015 it was a chargeback that made me furious.
But now I am kinda rich so I have this going for me which is nice.
@_date: 2018-04-23 06:26:29
Gold has lost its dominant use of being a currency for almost half a century now. I won't be surprised if it loses its dominance as the go to store of value too. None of us at crypto will tbh. For us it has already perish in both aspects.

You need to realize the century you are living in, thinking you can use anonymity in anything other than illegal transactions.
edit: Unless you only spend money for coffee and burgers \(with cash\) or either you live in a 3rd world country I can't understand what kind of purchases you think you can do on or off line anonymous.

There are more decentralized cryptos than Bitcoin out there so no big of an issue here.
@_date: 2015-11-20 11:18:51
since now the percentage of bitcoin is at ~0.025% of GDP I think 10% its not that far fetch.especially if there is a greater need for international/internet trade in the future than it is now.
@_date: 2015-11-20 01:15:17
I am sure this humvee is purchased with bitcoins...

when IMF and the european central banks decided that Greeks need to be under capital control I made my money bankless long live bitcoins.
 Banks are not a useful thing anymore neither its safe to keep your money on the pockets of such greedy scumbags that value printed papers more than human life.

Do you like to have a warranty at your products cause I don't know you could get one anonymous. /s 
Jokes aside you seem to be a teenager. Oblivious of how trade works in the real world.
