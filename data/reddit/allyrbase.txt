What about the Cryptosteel replacement cassettes from the previous batch that has issues? I've sent 3 emails so far and all I got was radio silence.

A word of warning from an existing customer... Wojciech is extremely communicative up to the point you discover that you have an issue with your Cryptosteel.
Good luck getting getting a response after he's taken your money.
Caveat emptor

Miners work to provide a service in exchange for payment by the community. 
The community decides who to employ for said service.

*facepalm* Gotcha! 
Apologies, I misunderstood your position.

Some users yes... from what I’m hearing *offline*, there are far more users that are against 2X than pro I’m afraid.
Community does indeed exist.

I'll take my chances with shitpeas.
Chances are shitpeas2x will fail miserably anyway.
I'll meet you back here in a couple of months so we can swap notes.

Yes fairly easy! Go to the core site an follow their instructions.

Correct on one node per IP address. Wrong on a walletless fullnode doesn't add anything.

Dangle as many gold carrots in front of them, miners will eventually and ultimately follow consensus, not the other way around.

Having the same issue with mine. Did you manage to resolve this issue?
