yea but in my bitpay wallet my addresses are still not segwit. are they ever going to fully accept segwit or are they just happy to be able to accept segwit transactions?

make an iphone one

@_date: 2017-12-31 00:33:20
when I do that i still don’t see all the transactions running through my node. now what
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:05:48
dang thanks i’m still new here
@_date: 2017-08-28 10:00:29
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:55:00
How do you read them numbers from that bot?
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:59:32
yea i'm n bitcoin I just want to see everything resolved and I want to see how this lightning network is going to work. this is a great idea I think
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:42:21
lol oops i wrote what i wanted to say in the title part sorry
@_date: 2019-06-10 17:25:20
So how do you make a bootable flash drive with your wallets.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:22:13
I really believe that BCH is a pump and dump for real
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:34:32
ok thanks
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:16:59
boo we don’t want BCH
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:16:18
Of course we want me to invest in Bitcoin you had the wrong answer
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:26:48
yea I tried this before I wrote this question. this doesn't work all it says is that Bitcoin-qt.exe is not a commandlet. I don't know how people regain access to there wallets. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:24:13
what do you mean replace it? what I do is where the new wallet.dat file is I delete that one and put mine there and nothing happens. I shut down bitcoin-qt then start it back up and another wallet.dat file populates there. so there is mine and a new one.
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:18:16
I did download the whole blockchain and when I go into the wallet folder and put my old wallet there nothing happens.
@_date: 2017-09-10 00:18:53
the blockchain store.com
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:24:40
Do you know what kinds of wallets I can set up to run through my node. I want my node to be the node that broadcasts my transactions. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:11:53
fuck that would be nice
@_date: 2018-03-19 08:07:25
dang I got iphone
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:52:37
ok thanks for the idea I will do that
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:52:30
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:31:09
I’m still new to this but if I make a transaction my node will know if it is in a block? don’t the other wallets do that too?
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:48:41
what do you mean copy wallet.dat I put my old wallet.dat in the wallet folder and then restarted and nothing happened when it booted back up it just made another random wallet.dat file. because I deleted the one it origanaly made.
@_date: 2018-02-26 02:02:48
thanks guys I finally got it. Now how do I make the icons in the bottom right corner bigger so I can see them
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:55:07
yea i did that I just want to make the icons bigger
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:17:09
Ok cool thanks for the idea
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:29:50
ok cool
@_date: 2018-02-26 08:03:15
dang that worked is that the only way
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:53:24
Really does that work
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:50:47
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:33:37
Ok thanks it does make sense because my last computer was old and the icons were bigger. Yea it's 4k
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:47:59
thanks for all the info I had my firewall not allowing it. but when I was looking there was like 5 bitcoin-qt on my firewall I allowed them all but I don't know why there was so many. I hope I did the right thing. I have more connections now.
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:46:55
well 20k again soon!
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:10:59
dang faucets back then would have been cool
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:03:02
that is the same price point when I started with bitcoin. and around $600 when I started to try and get others involved. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:12:50
so it could happen were two people could end up with the same private key then hey. It’s just huge odds against it. Thanks I always wondered how you could get private keys made offline now it makes sense that the computer just picks any combination at random instead of looking at all other keys. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:20:58
how do I create segwit addresses. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:18:07
That won't make them bigger just easier to see. Lol
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:43:32
ok thanks what about the version I am running now does it accept segwit transactions
@_date: 2018-03-19 08:06:58
ok cool I will check this out
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:06:35
Awesome shirt. where did you get it? I just bought a Bitcoin shirt with my QR address on it. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 07:47:16
I can’t buy crypto on robinhood yet!
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:18:30
I don’t think roger ver is smart I hate the idea of using unconfirmed transactions
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:50:08
it’s fine 
@_date: 2017-07-15 03:13:22
yea I am just using them to buy and then transfer right out, and I am not doing anything around that time
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:14:41
ok I will try
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:27:46
thanks for this. this is exactly how I feel too. hold strong. crypto for the long run
