I would personally never pay using BTC with 20$ fee's when I could use a credit card or other forms of payment. Why would you ever do this? Honestly...
Its cool to say "We are taking power away from the banks!" but at the same time you are fucking yourself over by paying way more than you need to...to what end? If you want to pay in crypto use a coin that has less fee's. BTC is not a suitable form of payment in its current state. thats just fact. Unless it is a high value payment. 
Convince me I am wrong. 
Also, most of these companies are just going to cash out the Bitcoin anyways, so what did you really accomplish besides paying a ton in fee's?
Serious question

If you paid in BTC and BTC plummeted to 1k for some reason, would you still want your refund in BTC?
no, you wouldn't, cause you're a whiny b*tch
Hypothetical situation: You were a business, and you could refund someone the exact amount of $ they gave you, and you pay either a .50 cent fee to get that money to them, or a 20$ fee to get that $ to them, what would you choose? You paid them the equivalent of USD in BTC, and you got the equivalent USD back in the form of BCH.
WAHHHH THEY REFUNDED ME!!!!

oh wait
most places cash out the btc instantly to fiat, because like it or not, btc has price swings. and if you got a refund, believe it or not, it would be the exact same fiat value you paid. I dare you to find me an example anywhere that would return to you the btc value you paid.

To play the Devils avocado, why people will buy Bitcoin cash is as follows. Bitcoin is hitting the mainstream now, and the people who are now suddenly interested in it are not interested in the fundamentals or philosophy from it, but merely looking for profits. From a surface perspective, lower fees (Bitcoin cash) looks far more attractive than 20$ fee.s. To them, everything else is the same, as many won't delve deep into the technical aspects of it. I believe that Bcash will definitely grow a lot in 2018 especially since it is now on coinbase. Love it or hate it, it's not going anywhere. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:08:01
People can do what they want with their money and their life. Who cares? People use crypto for all sorts of reasons. Why should they be restricted in what they chose to do with their life? Bitcoins not an official organization or a company.

To the Naive (Think to yourself now, Evian water. What is Evian spelled backwards? oh whoops....yeah the masses are easily influenced) there is no difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash except that it is an upgrade. I myself am a little bit confused on the inside because the Lightning Network seems just as centralized as Bitcoin Cash when you look at it right. Lightning Network requires everyone to send their money to a hub which will than exchange everyones money together offchain for very cheap. You just have to pay the settlement costs to the main chain. Who is to say what that hub could do to your money once it is in it. It is just as much of a bank as a bank is...a custodian of your money. And Bitcoin Cash is very miner centralized, which skews the system of checks and balances in Bitcoin. 
Anyways, I guess what I am getting at is there are many ways to view this issue, but Bitcoin Cash, mark my words, is going to be advertised heavily in the coming months as the new Bitcoin, and as the Original Bitcoin. It is going to grow in value because its immediate utility is far more useful than Bitcoin's, as it will have the same features but lower fee's. 20$ fee's make Bitcoin useless to a large amount of the world. If a system can accomodate more users and have a larger real world use case, it will long term be more successful.
I believe in a healthy future for both, but I think it is short sighted and ignorant to say Bitcoin Cash is without utility and has no future.

Litecoin also has the ability to utilize the upgrades Bitcoin developers developed and apply them much quicker than the years of squabbling it takes Bitcoin to get anything actually done. Litecoin has made more gains this year than Bitcoin has and its existence is important to the evolution of Bitcoin because it paves the way as to what is actually possible and secure for the Bitcoin network..
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:08:56
No because it will always cost $ to spend btc and when a free to spend alternative comes along people will choose that. To large parts of the world, even fee.s that are small to us could be astronomical to them. Bitcoin is the original template for crypto but that does not mean it is the best. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:53:03
No. I expect both to grow but bitcoins to grow more because Bitcoin has the infrastructure for large money investors. I feel most people investing in Bitcoin now are long term holders who aren't trying to do small transactions or actually spend it as a currency but to use it more as a long term investment tool. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 19:42:12
It’s going to get harder and harder to pass any changes through the BTC code. Prepare for the future now, or have the future come and scramble to keep up is the way I see it. Hopefully BTC does not become crippled due to sheer volume of use. Realistically, nobody is going to opt to use a crypto for everyday things that has even a .20 cent fee.

Consensus tickets for attendance are $2k+ per ticket, with rare exceptions like students can be elligible for a $1k ticket. There is mass media that will be there, as well as a bunch of exciting alt-coin projects that have likely been with-holding huge news just for this event. It seems like a likely candidate to be a catalyst to break into an uptrend. Lots of people that attend are looking to invest big $$ into crypto, either through hedge funds, personal, or businesses. It is a big deal in the crypto world. Last year the attendance was 2700, this year it will be closer to 8000. We will find out this week what is up, but it makes sense for Consensus to light a fuse.

with the real global trading percentage of china being revealed through the absence of 0% trading fee's, we can now see china's true role in the global btc trade. additionally, it would be expected that china would try to crack down on all ways the chineese are attempting to evacuate their $ from local currency. However, they can still buy btc, and withdrawal btw to their own currency. and being that BTC has been a steady store of value lately, even staying steady during these announcements when in the past, PBOC announcements would cause drastic drops in BTC price, it seems keeping their money in BTC would be as good or better than transferring to a foreign exchange to sell for USD at this point in time. Plus, the fact that PBOC is trying to legitimize these exchanges as opposed to ban them is favorable as well

right now, probably best use cases of btc are speculation, storage of value, or buying things you have no other way of acquiring except through btc. no one is forcing you to buy coffee with bitcoin, and selling your bitcoin to a merchant who accepts it for coffee doesn't do the community much good as odds are they sell it to an exchange in return for their local currency immediately anyways.

spending doesn't really help bitcoin much right now anyways, because most places accepting it will immediately cash it out so spending = selling pretty much.

why shouldn't you? if you believed in it back then for the long term, the same principles still hold. A lot has happened to bitcoin in the last 4.5 years. If the theft from MT. GOX, which handled about 90% of the volume back in the day, didn't kill bitcoin, what will? Bitcoin is very resiliant. 
Right now its biggest problem is that too many people are using it and so it has become slow, and the price has rise so much that the fee's are now expensive.
This is a good perspective to view it from. Sure, its not practical to buy a cup of coffee with it right now. But bitcoin isn't at that stage yet. A lot will have to happen for scaling it to get to the mass adoption stage. It is definitely still a good time to hold btc.

From my understanding, once adoption has plateau.d and the price is much higher, it will make more sense to
Use as a currency as it would be much more stable. Once it is a reliable enough store of value that a company would keep most of the Bitcoin they receive as payment for goods instead of immediately turning it into fiat is probably a time when it would make more sense to buy stuff with Bitcoin. I feel like the price has a long ways to go upwards still, but eventually it will start to level off.

For now I think it does everyone a favor if you just HODL it. Spending it means you no longer have that btc and that a store just cashed it into fiat. Buying stuff would act the same as selling. Might as well just hold till stores get to the point they would hold most of their earned btc.

OTC would be if some person/group/organization wanted to buy say 2 million dollars of BTC. They could go to a company like Circle or others, and arrange that deal.

How is spending BTC helping it? I see this repeated a lot and I gotta scratch my head. Spending BTC is cool that it is an option and it is good that more and more places are accepting it, but until places you spend it actually hold onto it instead of cashing it out instantly for $$, when you buy something with Bitcoin you are essentially just selling your BTC. Holding does far more as far as stability and increasing the price. The higher the price rises, over time, we experience less volatility which would incentivize companies to hold onto BTC that is spent on products at their store. 
HODL for 3 more years or more is a solid plan IMHO. However, no wrong way to use bitcoin, use it how you want to. But Holding it is not hurting BTC.

I would image (hope) that people buying 1+ coins at this point have done enough due diligence to understand bitcoin, what it is about and that at this point holding long term is a wise move. A less informed investor might also be playing with a lesser amount of $$. This is all speculation, but at this point to buy more than 1 coin takes a good amount of capital, and those who are willing to spend that capital are hopefully smart enough to understand smart investing and the bitcoin market. 
What i'm getting at is, in my mind it would make sense that the traders who are more emotional and impulsive aren't invested as heavily as those who understand the market. There are probably a lot of newbs invested not very heavily, but the people who own large amounts of coin understand bitcoin.

Being that the blockchain is fully transparent, this is inevitable. The hope with the bulk of crypto investors is to make big $$.

Bitcoin does face some serious hurdles if it will ever become a widely used world currency. The very fact alone that you have to pay a fee to send any transaction is de-incentivizing and will inevitably alienate a large percentage of the world population. If/when a free to spend alternative comes along, people will choose that over the pay to spend. Bitcoin has the front runner advantage for now, but the amount of people who own crypto now is minuscule compared to where it is going. Store of Value? Sure. For now. Scaling Bitcoin to a level that can handle a global user base at reasonable transaction times and affordable to all people will be difficult in my opinion. Especially with how it will only become increasingly harder to get any software upgrade with consensus passed through. 
In my opinion, Bitcoin will be king for a while to come. But it is not out of the picture for it to become a "MySpace" while something superior surpasses it as the "Facebook". I love Bitcoin, but it has growing pains.

Other crypto’s can &amp; will do international transfers for FAR LESS than 40$. Saying fees are 40$, why would anyone prefer to spend that to open &amp; close a channel when they could just use Venmo/PayPal/cash app/cheaper crypto’s. To me, this is a serious problem BTC will need to overcome.
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:39:16
I mean...what do you think about his points though? Because to me they all seem valid and are definitely going to be barriers to mass adoption. Why use this complicated non-reversible technology when you can use a credit card that gets you reward points and insures you against fraud? Why would anybody in their right mind use BTC for anything if the fee’s are 50$ (it will get there again if the price reaches a new ATH). These are all important questions to ask. I surely wouldn’t use it
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:44:15
Fees right now are low you’re right, I’m just thinking about when BTC breaks ATH again with hundreds of thousands/millions of new people using the network. I imagine fee’s will reach a new ATH as well. Also I was unaware of PayPal’s fee’s as I never really use it. Just when I have used it to send $$ P2P I’ve never had any fee’s that I was aware of.
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:26:54
Fees are low now. What about when they start climbing back up to 50$? Taxes for BTC are also a headache. Do you personally actually use BTC to buy anything? Things like Venmo, credit cards &amp; cash are way simpler. “Don’t send money to the wrong person”..mistakes happen, especially with the technologically illiterate. There is pretty much no reason for anyone to use BTC to buy stuff today except for the novelty of it in 90% of the cases.

I mean, that’s what lots of people say about BTC too, that’s why it has been declared dead so many times.

The amount of machoism and deceit McAfee portrays is up there with the best. But he is compelling, like the best too. At the end of the day though, I’ve met compelling “Buddha” types that after long enough one realizes are human like the rest of us, but sometimes even more full of it. I respect McAfee &amp; he does indeed have a unique trajectory from the rest..but he’s not “the one” &amp; 99.9% of people are too much of a lemming to even see “The One” if it was in front of them. Perhaps myself included. But McAfee is not somebody who should be leading this country. He is somebody who is in a way following Trumps blueprint of super wealthy IDGAF individual putting himself in the political spotlight. For the purpose of crypto advocacy, as he says. I imagine he intends on making fortunes with his publicity by advertising certain crypto’s. He does not plan on winning, is too rediculous to win, &amp; is not a serious candidate.

We are about to get some serious adoption in the future, and it takes forever to come to consensus on anything in Bitcoin.

Lol wut? You may have gone on a tangent there. 
Anyhow,  my thoughts on McAfee are...he is a smart person. Yet, he is also an idiot (at the very least, idiolizes an alcoholic/cigarette addict lifestyle as a positive thing.) knows he is charsimatic, charming person &amp; knows the youth are his audience. Plays into the image of the badass older figure who is the successful rebel (granted, he is authentically a crazy ass mofo who is definitely very smart &amp; skilled @ what he does, no matter what it is) but knows people are gullible. He plays into psyche to remain relevant and play people like a fiddle till he gets center stage. Once he’s on that stage, he will likely have luminarious things to say. 
My conclusion? I think he is full of shit, but worth listening to at the same time. I don’t think he’ll win presidency, nor do I think he cares to at the same time. But he will say what he wants to, &amp; it will likely be smarter, more entertaining &amp; more authentic than most anyone else. I’d be surprised if he doesn’t get decent airtime. Just remember, all the theatrics you see now...EVERYTHING...From this point forwards. Is theatrics to generate hype &amp; airtime for 2020 elections. He’s full of shit, but he’ll be interesting &amp; likely insightful in many ways too.

I believe the price can hit 100k for sure, and the higher the price goes the more stable the currency becomes. If you throw a pebble in a puddle it's ripples are more encompassing than if you throw it in a lake. The larger btc is, the harder it will be to influence the price.

That's kind of the point of btc original, peer to peer cash = no third party and associated fee.s. Point is, this technology will evolve to have no fee.s, some altcoins are alreading doing this.

In the video he said he didn't cash out the Bitcoins his store received (like the majority of all places that accept BTC do). Roger might be manipulative and misleading, but he's not an idiot.

Until it gets to the point that companies don't just sell off the btc as soon as they get it, using BTC for everyday purchases is unnecessary and inconvienent in my opinion and acts the same as you just selling it, since thats what the companies do. HODLing makes the most sense for the time being IMO.

What is your bad news? Obviously no one can say for certain what Bitcoin will do because anything can happen, but the general trend is up. Also, one of the main incentives for the vast majority of people to get into Bitcoin is financial gain. The amount of adoption right now is tiny in the grand scheme. A patient hodler buying now can still see huge gains in the long run. 
My advice to new comers is to make sure you understand what you are investing in, and if you believe in it. My personal opinion is this train still has a ways to go. China news used to really really shake the market, now not as much. The whole ecosystem seems to be maturing.

Hahaha, that's the part of the whole conspiracy theory I don't understand the most. Tether is designed to be pegged to the dollar. When btc is crashing, that is the most logical time for more tethers to be created, while people hedge their falling assets into something that will stay stable. I mean, that's the whole point of tether.
Theres definitely some large holes in the theory, but it is great FUD that's effective at making people hesitant to buy into BTC or make HODLers want to sell so they don't get wiped out by Tether.
For example...Say Tether HAS been being fraudulent. I imagine the venture was highly profitable, and they likely have enough $ from the profits they made to cover everything. If they actually used Tether to pump the price up to 20k than dumped, I don't see why they couldn't have exorbitant amounts of money. 
BTC has survived a lot at this point. The way I see it, there will always be FUD in the market. Always. I believe things will be ok. I'm happy I didn't sell in fear of a hardfork, in fear of it being banned, in fear of falling prices.

Its not about getting the entire world to use BTC. Its about making it an option for those people in the world who chose to use it, for whichever reason they find benefit in. For a lot of people it is for wealth storage because the general trend in BTC is up, or because their currency inflates so much that BTC is more stable. 
However, say there are 30 million people using Bitcoin right now. I do not know if this number is accurate or not. That is NOTHING in the global population. If there was only a couple percent of the global population using Bitcoin/crypto, that would be a many fold influx. I feel like as time goes on and the technology improves/costs go down, there will be 100+million people who find crypto useful in their lives to some degree at the minimum. Likely far more than that.

People leave BTC for other crypto all the time. BTC is the front runner and will be for a while, but the future for BTC as the forever and always best and most used, I think only time will tell. BTC has short-comings in it and is going to have to keep dealing with scaling issues and the community becomes increasingly toxic around scaling issues. Bitcoin definitely has the most established ecosystem of any coin, but once again this industry is very young. Its entirely possible what we see right now is 1.0 for crypto, and a second gen of coins are created that iron out the kinks and improve upon the protocol of what is available and popular today. 
They say though, money usually stays in crypto once it enters it, so the market cap of it all will keep growing. What was once BTC money will go into alts and vice versa. 
Going to be an interesting space to watch develop over the next coming years. I think it would be wise to view all of this space with an open mind, and not rule out any possibilities of what may or may not happen. Don't be afraid to let your mindset change along time, but pay attention and see what feels right.

I'm not saying they are making it Chinese currency or that they are trying to buy all the BTC. But I do feel its possible they could be accumulating BTC and they are definitely fully aware of how all this news they put out affects the market. It would be an easy sell at the top and than scoop up cheap. I'm not saying its 100% certain but I do feel it is possible this is going on alongside all of the ICO shenanigans which also do make sense because ICO's can fleece people of their money real quick.

Say it hits 2k this month. That's not the price one year, 5 years or 10 years from now. They would be doing this not based on the price right this moment, but based on where they expect it could go, and the impact it could have. They would want a stake in that.

China has announced that the ICO ban is temporary. Even if this news is true about crypto exchanges being banned, which I doubt it is because it all stems from unnamed sources and doesn't add up, it would make sense that the crypto exchange ban would also be temporary. I doubt a crypto exchange ban will happen, but if it does I highly doubt it would be permanent. However, it is fun China FUD yay. And i'm sure a lot of people will profit heavily from it.

Cheap was 100$ but BTC's future was also far less certain back than also. If one believes the prices could go 100k+ in the future, 4k is still cheap and the market has more confidence in it now than ever before in my opinion. Also, if you re-read my post right above yours, in the first sentence I say that I do NOT believe that they are trying to buy up all of the BTC, but that they could be grabbing a solid chunk. And yup, I agree that BTC is a global phenomena at this point and any country that bans it is doing their citizens a disservice.

Russia is putting 100 million into Bitcoin mining. Japanese company GMO just announced they plan on putting 300 million into Bitcoin mining, as well as making commercially available an ASIC mining chip that is over 2 times as fast as the current fastest ASIC, as well as being much more energy efficient. 
Given that these two countries announced their plans to up mining, I would not be surprised to see other countries follow suit. I think the days of China having such a monopoly on mining should hopefully start coming to an end  in the coming time.

cryptocurrencies will change the world in many, many ways. You are right in my mind though, this is a war for the future of our species. If a crypto succeeds that is centralized and controlled the consequences of a system that powerful with a central dictator would be catastrophic. That is because money could be controlled and monitored to a higher degree than ever before. A strong, robust, scalable and secure crypto currency that is properly decentralized to the degree that it is near impossible to gain control of the network is what we need. We have that with Bitcoin currently but it is important that there is a model that can exist far  into the future.

I've got a crystal ball but I can't see the future. Crypto has the potential to unwind things and shift the poles of power. It is going to be interesting to watch this GLOBAL phenomena unfold because the future really is unwritten and technology has disrupted every sector of our lives to date. You can order food online and have it delivered to your house. To say that governments would not want this to happen is one thing, but to say that it cannot happen is another thing. Truth is, nobody knows. But this technology is both powerful and contagious. Lets see what happens.

They can still demand their taxes and there can still be the old billionaires and millionaires of the world. But there can also be new-found, extraordinarily wealthy individuals who hold different world views/values than those of the past. People who have come into positions of extreme wealth who can use their wealth to actualize different ideals than those of the old. A lot of early investors in crypto are people who may not be cut from the same grain as the established elite of today. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:04:37
If the POW is changed, existing miners with their ASIC's would probably just switch over to BCH instead of letting all of their equipment go to waste. Wouldn't this just make BCH the more technically secure and tried and tested chain of BTC if it were to happen?

A lot of people I know, if were given 250 million or more, would assess their wealth as "well, I only need a fraction of this to live my life however they want to."

This convos not about me. Also talking about personal holdings of any crypto online to strangers is not smart, no matter the amount you own. I aim to be smart. I think Nexus is a smart idea. I don't have a crystal ball to its future, but it doesn't take a genius to see there is something distinctly unique and special about this coin technically. The only thing here is you actually have to look. Anyways, I've said what I need to if anyone read all this and is intrigued  just do your own research there is a wealth of info available online. Very interesting project that you'll most likely hear about again in the future in my opinion. As of now, no need for me to spend my time on people who largely aren't trying to listen or gain a new view point. presumptive criticisms of something you haven't given an open mind to or educated yourself on is a waste of both of our time.

Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs, but the way the world works right now is people owe taxes on this stuff. And the gov is going to find a way to figure out if you didn't pay. They don't want the public image either that it is easy to get away with this. If people don't think other governments are going to follow suit, they are naive in my opinion. Pay your taxes, save your future self the trouble.

Here's the thing...exchanges requiring kyc/aml doesn't restrict innovation, unless the innovation you are talking about is innovating new ways to make lots of money and dodge paying taxes on them. Buying BTC is a lot different than buying sugar, and people are making huge amounts of money off of it. Realistically, of course the gov is going to want to crack down on the on/off ramps of crypto to fiat. Duh they are going to want there to be kyc/aml, and I am surprised it has taken this long for localbitcoins to do this honestly. You can disagree with it all you want, but don't act surprised as the amount of $$ being generated and also largely not reported is huge and growing exponentially.

Eh, I've personally never had an issue with them. They had very slow customer service last year when I needed to use it, but they were gaining customers at a rate of up to 100k/day.

High Fee's can't compete with a much higher price. A 4k btc with lower fee's would give them more $ than 2k btc with high fee's. Therefore, I don't believe this logic.
 Miners are afraid that if segwit gets passed, there will be no block size increase ever because everything can go to layer two. This is more concerning to them over the longterm as the amount of BTC produced starts to decrease and the amount of people using it increases. They want to ensure their profitability, which makes sense because mining is a business.
@_date: 2019-05-04 09:35:07
Lol why in the world would you sell now? Youve lost out on interest? How much interest are you realistically going to make? Bc BTC has climbed from under 4K to almost 6k in ~2 months.

Did you perhaps sell btc on locL bitcoins to someone who may have done something less than legal with the coins?
Your problem is not going to be with exchanges but with the law. Simply put, no company is going to put themselves in risk of being non-compliant with the law so that others can break it. It makes sense if a company feels their user is breaking the law or aiding others breaking the law they would ban their account, or risk legal trouble themselves. We can all disagree with the morality of laws but it doesn't change the fact that they do exist and there are reprocissions for breaking them, reprocissions that a business would rather be safe than sorry with in avoiding.
Hopefully they give you a chance to explain your situation. To others, be mindful of what you do and where your coins go and how they get there.
