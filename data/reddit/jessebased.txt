I remember when they were at $11 and thinking about buying a couple but thought they were over valued at the time, a couple months later they were at $1000 a coin.....

Later in the report it was said that all his blog post were edited after 2013. So he could have registered the email, go back to his blog, edit old post to include the email, then let everyone think he is satoshi.

lol yes I believe you dude, I never said you were wrong. Time frame wasn't important in my story. I'm just saying I remember when it was a low price and then later hearing on the news that it was at $1000

This movie was for young hip people. It had so many references to underground hip hop and culture. If you didn't geek out from this movie then it wasn't for you.

Ok don't get me wrong, the story line was definitely corny. I bet you would have hated the ending. It is also a indie movie with a lot of first timers so I'm not being as critical as you are. But when I meant "underground culture" I meant current underground culture. Vince Staples, Casey Veggies, and King G were all underground rappers that were in the movie too. Most people would never expect to see them on the big screen so it was cool to me since I was a fan of them. 
Also the whole bitcoin and dark net is an underground culture I'm also apart of and it was awesome to see how correct they had everything and even used the real name of a now defunct darknet site(Blackmarket Reloaded).  
Then also throw in Chanel Iman(famous model who dated Asap Rocky), Zoey Kravits, and Blake Anderson in to mix. It was cool to feel connected to the movie which kind made up for the corny writing. Wasn't the best movie but it was cool, 7/10 would watch again.

I have both Circle and Coinbase apps on my phone as well as breadwallet. I simply buy bitcoins instantly on either app and copy/paste my address and in under a minute I have my bitcoins along with the private keys of my wallet. As long as I have breadwallet backed up on paper and have a secure pin im fairly safe. 
This as simple as it gets i think
