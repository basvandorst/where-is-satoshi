I believe you mean "Ajit Pai sights ...."

No dude, he can *see* it.

What if you are carrying a hardcopy of a seed, or a seed phrase, and it's worth $9990.00 when you go through customs, then as you are taking off in the plane, or even just before you fly across the border, trading price increases and it's now $10,100.00 worth.  Did you break the law?

Well, from my limited understanding (I've been trying hard to study the mechanics) a transaction isn't confirmed until it is included in a block, which happens approximately every 10 minutes.  The blocks are difficult to calculate (on purpose) and all the miners are trying to figure out how to calculate it, which is why it takes so long.  And when computing power of all the miners increases, the difficulty is increased to keep it at 10 minutes.
You may be verifying that your transaction has been broadcast out and that it is pending verification, but if it doesn't make it into the block, which can happen (not enough fees, high volume), then it hangs around for awhile trying to get into the next block.  Sometimes transactions [can take a long time]( to get into a block, and I believe eventually they give up and the transaction is discarded.  This delay is part of what the recent fork and the SegWit2x upgrade are attempting to fix
Fiat of course, the receiver is physically in possession of, so it can't really disappear.  I suppose it's a bit like credit cards where at a later date the transaction may not be allowed because of fraud, chargebacks, etc., which happen rarely enough to be acceptable.    But there is recourse to those situations in credit cards, I don't think there really are with Bitcoin.  I suppose that there would be a limit, where for a significant value transaction, the person would need to wait to see actual verification before receiving the goods/service.

The thing I don't understand about these situations is who has time to wait 10 minutes for the transaction to be confirmed?  I get antsy when the credit card machine is slow to authorize.  Really takes the convenience out of convenience store.

Right, that's pretty much what I was laying out.  But it could reach a point of ridiculousness. Right now we are 7.5 billion people.  The max coin is 21 million.  Quite a few are estimated to be lost already.  It's not a super huge problem, obviously.

Couldn't we eventually run out from mistakes once new coin are no longer created?  Would we just scale it at that point like Zimbabwe Dollars, but the opposite direction?  10^-6 BTC is now 1 BTC.  Or will it eventually just be using ridiculously small fractions?

My gold is in a safe in the basement.  Does it count towards that total or not?  Just curious.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:57:48
Because it's sarcastic gold.  I was poking fun at the term "above ground gold".  Gold in the basement is below ground still.

That's the joke though. In the original it is a coin of low value , insinuating that his current computer is off so low value (not being a Unix box) that a computer purchased with that coin would be better, though still low value.
The same joke is in the movie grease when the scorpion dents his car and offers him a nickel to buy a new car and girlfriend, implying their combined value is lower than that.

It seems that way, but if they all tried to convert to USD, then what would happen?
