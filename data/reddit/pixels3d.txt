@_date: 2017-12-11 17:48:56
Oh fuck.
@_date: 2018-09-21 15:51:31
I like it. Good job.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:00:59
Looking for the same thing. Just need the Trezor to make sure it fits. I got the printer and have printed it out lol
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:32:54
Don't forget to get a holder to store it in a secure location! Shameless advertisement, from me.

@_date: 2018-08-08 23:22:05
That is also an option!
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:21:18
Not 8, but a couple.
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:40:37
Don't you tell your family about your coins, how to operate the storage units etc. Nothing would be sacrificed here.
@_date: 2018-08-09 10:57:15
Check out  once they are finished you'll be able to get them there!
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:19:55
Not yet, I will upload a video for you. We'll do it for science!
@_date: 2018-08-13 01:36:50
Well of course!
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:20:53
But do you really?
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:15:23
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:15:10
This is actually a really good idea.
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:08:17
That seems to be Reddit's favorite place!
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:56:23
Maybe I should look at tapering the top.
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:22:42
When the prototype is all finalized you'll be able to get it at 
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:15:30
Why not?
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:10:18
The real question that should be asked is why not?
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:59:11
Oh, yes yes. That's exactly what I put away in the video. Not a pizza edition ledger.
@_date: 2018-08-09 10:54:56
Even if your joking, they will be for sale once the prototype is finished at 
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:44:39
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:18:52
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:19:13
Only if you know about it already I feel like. But you have a point.

I'm not going to lie, I'm surprisingly now worried about how many innocent pencil cup holders get thrown out each year.

This can be done if you'd like to custom order this!

@_date: 2018-08-08 21:19:27
They will be. It's my latest design, trying something new.
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:24:38
That's a pretty good option, but don't burglard go for sock drawers? Maybe that's a movie thing.
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:18:16

@_date: 2018-08-09 10:58:21
Hahahaha, thanks man. After being on Reddit for ages, you know exactly how most of the comments will be. 
There's some comment gold in here which had been cracking me up from the start!
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:08:59
Why not?
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:09:34
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:22:04
Not bad at all!

Creative ways are the best though!
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:27:11
I need 8!
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:21:46
Was waiting for this haha.
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:22:12
My inspiration!
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:20:38
In one of these. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:27:10
Luckily you got seeds to back it up!
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:08:39
I have 30+ Colors, it can be whichever someone chooses. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 10:55:55
That's next one the list. Once the prototype is finished there will be a ledger and Trezor one available. You'll be able to get it here 
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:56:18
That would be an odd thing to throw when there's plenty other objects!
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:23:01
I hope not!
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:25:38
Thanks for the laugh!
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:23:22
Who doesn't have their seeds stashed safely?
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:50:40
You'd be really surprised. Ever seen what goes for sale on Ebay?
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:26:10
You have a design? I'd love to see it!
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:13:25
I wouldn't say the least.
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:23:27
Hahahahahaha, hopefully my mom doesn't do that when she stops over.
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:24:06
Clearly lol
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:39:33
Most likely because you could probably just buy another.
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:51:41
Time to make it look ugly.
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:44:11
Not yet. But they will with adoption.
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:25:03
Nope, I mean ledger.
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:53:42
Working on it!
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:54:39
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:22:22
Why not?
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:14:08
I'm just happy I got everyone's mind off the price!
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:23:37
Jimmy, once the prototype is finished you'll be able to get it at 
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:32:25

@_date: 2018-08-08 23:22:52
Hopefully not!
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:44:26
Luckily it's on a ledger.
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:09:51
I could probably think of a few worst places, I don't think you're trying hard enough!
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:41:37
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:19:09
Yeah, it's okay though!
@_date: 2018-08-09 10:59:40
Please unnote. -civilian

r/bitbug42 What woocommerce extension did you use to integrate lightning payments? I'm looking to add it to mine also!
@_date: 2018-06-27 13:03:56
My shop has a few of them:
- Monoprice Maker Select v2.1
- CR-10S x 2
- Prusa MK3
Allows me to pump out orders pretty fast now haha.
@_date: 2018-06-16 18:39:03
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:25:26
and you should delete this ASAP.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:58:18
I'd be sad for a moment. So better off HODLing.
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:15:21
I'll get this started. We accept Bitcoin.  We product case and mounts for Ledger, Trezor and Opendime.
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:22:25
I re-read. I agree with the part about sites accepting bitcoin and automatically converting it back into Fiat.
My shop is CryptoCloaks  - We sell hardwallet mounts and cases.
@_date: 2018-06-17 03:50:13
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:14:48
I don't agree with you. 
Our shop allows customers to pay with Bitcoin and other alts. When we receive Bitcoin, we either hodl it or buy other items with the Bitcoin. When we get alt payments, we turn those into Bitcoin and hodl.
You might want to calarify your rant a bit.
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:37:29


We are currently using PLA Filament for these, which is not known to hold a static charge but anything has the possibility to potentially gather one.
This is a great idea to look into, as there are actually ESD safe printing materials.
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:46:02
Question, why do I need to send a picture of my government ID to you to get access?
@_date: 2018-06-27 22:18:57
I only want Bitcoin paid out so we're good!
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:19:32
Check us out at  for more colors!
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:04:54
Mirror vinyl wrap coming right up. No one will be able to see it.
@_date: 2018-06-16 18:38:14
We support crypto in general because it's the way of the future. If you were to look on the site, Bitcoin is stated as the main currency. Allowing other currencies help us reach more customers and helping us achieve our goal of protecting. It's sad to see this as a henderence to supporting companies that are trying to grow the space in general. We're sorry to see this stopping you, but we respect your opinion.

Adding to the list!!!
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:24:38
It was very easy actually. 
Only thing I had to modify was removing &lt;?php echo $gateway-&gt;get_icon(); ?&gt; from the payment-method.php file in the woocommerce plugin folder. This was to get rid of the huge Globee image showing in checkout.
@_date: 2018-06-17 03:49:53
We'll look into it! Thanks for the recommendation.
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:31:45

@_date: 2018-06-17 03:43:58
Litecoin and dash currently, and expanding slowly.
@_date: 2018-06-17 03:47:11
We're 100% sure about it helping us expand and reaching more customers. It wouldn't make business sense if it didn't.
We hope you enjoy the rest of your weekend!

How's the shill party going?
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:47:55
HEADS UP: They are handing out gold to shills to make them seem reliable!
Look at comments
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:26:07
100% true, that's why I stuck with "More" secure and not "Most" Secure ;)
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:48:56
Yup, exactly! I absolutely hated having mine just laying around.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:42:56
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:18:50
We are in the middle of a crypto war, and the lowest of the lows are coming out to play. Bring it on you scum!
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:35:06
Redditor for 2 days.... FFS. SKIP!
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:41:28
Spam is real. HODL AND SKIP THIS!
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:22:52
I just got an email from bittrex regarding old orders, they must've seen this and played damage control lol.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:19:52
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:38:12
LMFAO. It just never ends. HODL AND SKIP!

That's a good point. Uploaded a version without the logo. Thanks for the idea.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:49:59
Thank you also!
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:52:18
Weird concept right?
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:02:26
Don't forget to get a mount for that bad boy and keep it off your desk! Shameless plug. Thecryptocloak.com.
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:13:11
I wen't old English :P Thee like the knights of the round table haha.
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:44:51
I hodl because I need to show these old sacks of potato's that Bitcoin is the future and not just Fake internet money!
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:30:06
 What font is that?
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:06:06
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:30:10
Yes! We actually have one in the works!
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:45:38
SCAM detected.
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:53:57
I wanted to let you know we also have our items listed on Bitify. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:49:54
If you look in the description of the item, it states if you'd like to pay with a cryptocurrency to please message me. As Etsy has yet to integrate Payments with Crypto this is the only way.
I'm sorry you missed this.
Please message me and I'd be happy to get your order through!
We look forward to your business, as we do accept crypto!
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:31:49
LMFAO, I did the same thing. Stupid as hell but I got that Dirt Bike I wanted and paid for 20 credits.
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:26:37
I wanted to come back and thank you for your comment. This has helped us realize it wasn't as easy as we thought for users to see we accept Bitcoin. We have made some changes that will hopefully allow users an easier experience. Thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:26:32
We're back, let's see if we can hodl above 10K
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:05:58
This is a legitimate guide. VERY HELPFUL! Thank you for this!
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:35:43
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:30:44
And Yes! We accept several crypto as payments. We are trying to do our part to show that crypto is here to stay.

@_date: 2018-02-27 20:09:49
Thank you very much!
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:28:34
I can sell my 1070ti I bought for $450 for $900. Easy money!

Sound good! You should, they are pretty awesome
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:17:29
Looking at it again, looks better with The. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:48:29
Not yet but on the list!

Redditor for 2 months also.
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:56:09
WTF did I just watch lol.
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:58:54
Is this Ready Player One?
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:05:41
We make those too with screws! Screw-less Trezor's are coming next!
@_date: 2018-03-12 21:04:32
Those are fricken legit. Prepare for people to start yelling at you for shilling posters. Very nice work OP.
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:21:39
If that played every time a crypto donation came in, I would constantly donate it and make the entire stream the clip on repeat. I guarantee you people would join in just to keep it going.
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:49:14
Thank you for this, time to set this up for my business.
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:35:32

Search for CryptoCloaks on ETSY for more information!
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:09:50
Etsy links don't work for r/bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:08:08
WTF is with these titles telling us the creator has arthritis, is 16, etc etc etc... Is this the new trend?
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:17:00
You fricken joking right? Grow up.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:46:29
Thank you! I'll take a look.

Whoa whoa whoa, don't start putting us all into one cat. I own a house with a 25year roof. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:06:56
It's a pretty big milestone for us and we just wanted to say thank you r/Bitcoin! 
After starting in December of 2017, we've come a long way and you have helped us go way farther than what thought would happen!
Lightning Payments are the future and we'd like to do a big shout out to all the people helping others get Lightning on their websites!
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:47:50
No problem!
@_date: 2018-07-02 22:00:22
Awesome thank you!
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:34:44
A billionaire telling me what to do with my money. I'm down!
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:13:58
This exactly, thank you!
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:20:35
Absolutely, that's the best part of what we do. Custom pieces can be easily done! There's an option to select custom on most mounts currently. We're working on a better way to accept custom projects. Currently there's a request quote at the moment. We also have some ideas for limited additions in the works also.
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:31:54
@_date: 2018-07-17 00:10:16
Not dumb at all. Lots of people mount them under their desks, there's a screw and screwless model. 
You can also hide them wherever you can think of. Under chairs, in walls on 2x4, bookshelves. The possibilities are really endless.
@_date: 2018-07-17 10:31:37
Thanks for that suggestion! We'll see what we can do for that!
@_date: 2018-07-17 12:41:16
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-07-17 10:32:44
We've had roughly 16 lightning payments now and the avg amount was $16.

@_date: 2018-07-02 15:19:54
Where do I go to get my business added to the list?
CryptoCloaks :  : Hard Wallet Cases, Mounts and Accessories.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:30:16
After all the reading I have done today, I'm not sure either still.
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:34:46
If you guys have any questions for us, we'd love to answer them.
@_date: 2018-07-17 10:30:57
So far, the ad ban has not taken a direct effect on our business. It would probably effect us in the future when we start pushing ads.
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:12:21
Thank you! It's actually WooCommerce!
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:18:00
Some people don't have the tools to make it. We have the machines. We appreciate your feedback. It's been noted!
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:26:15
spit my water out, thanks
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:23:51
