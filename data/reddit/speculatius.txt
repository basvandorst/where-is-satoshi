They won't be, it'll probably not reach the market, but instead be auctioned off in a secret auction, with only some really big buyers invited. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 19:05:30


If they are as good with money as their big pockets might lead us to believe:
Wait for the price to go up before selling, because otherwise what's the point of buying them in the first place? 
I mean the only reason they might dump them would be if they got them really cheap, and that usually doesn't happen at auctions, because there are too many buyers for them. 
Also, 23 million is not a big drop in a 7 billion-market, so even if they were to dump it, the only thing that could affect the market would be the panic of the uninformed...
And I guess there are more than enough people waiting for these panic sells (If it got to that, I'd buy more BTC, too).

The so-called "Nobel Prize in Economics" is ridiculous anyway, as it is not the same as the real Nobel Prizes.
 Alfred Nobel did not create it, it was created by the Swedish central bank because they wanted something to celebrate themselves, and the Nobel family is not too happy about it. [(wiki)](
It's as if you would create a "Nobel Trolling Prize", and proclaim someone you like the winner.

It's just that you're reacting to an obvious [copypasta]( as if it were a serious comment, which is something I can only imagine a 14-year-old or someone genuinely new to the internet doing. 
And the fact that you immediately call me a troll, just because I'm making fun of you, further proves my point ;-)
Take it easy, the thread didn't go according to your plans, no need to be so bitter about it.
/Edit: Now that I've seen a few of your other comments, I see that you're just a cheap downvote-troll, like that darkwing guy... Well, my bad for replying to you.

It was probably a typo, because a part of the gag order conspiracy theory revolves around him using a 9gag reference in an interview that makes no sense to use there, and directly referencing it as 9gag. 
I know this sounds stupid at first (as most conspiracy theories do\^\^), but in the theory it made a bit more sense (which, again, is pretty typical for conspiracy theories), it was something like: 
interviewer: do you have anything to say to this? 
karpeles: 9gag (link)
interviewer: ok ....
I don't believe it, but I also think this is the best theory so far, but only because the other theories are even shittier.

Maybe you know about it by now, but I believe it can't be posted often enough:
Use keypass, or lastpass, or anything like that for your passwords, and make a really strong one for every site you visit.
Mine are all 20 characters, and way too complicated for me to ever remember, that's dangerous, for sure, but on the other hand as long as I don't lose my password file (and I have a lot of backups) and my master password I am pretty safe.
I'd really recommend you read a bit about password managers and decide if you want to use one, imho they're too good not to use nowadays.

The last few times this popped up, most people seemed to be convinced that they'd settle this off the exchanges, with a few big buyers in an auction, so that it would not affect the price that much.
(Of course this still affects the price because the people who would otherwise have bought at an exchange now buy there, but it should prevent a panic)
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:06:30
Yeah, it was a stupid thought, motivated by feeling like an idiot because I started buying in when it was close to 1000... 
I did not "invest more than I can afford to lose", but it was still most of what I had saved up for the time after Uni, so the idea behind lowering my standard of living was to come out even in the next year, even if the bitcoin price doesn't reach 1000 again. 
Instead I'll probably just have to force myself to stop looking at the price, maybe set an alarm for when it goes up enough, and then maybe sell if I need the money. 
The most annoying thing is actually that I got interested in bitcoin 2 years ago because of the technological aspect, but never invested in it until recently -.-
But on the other hand, I don't have to be rich to be happy, and I can't know for sure that I would not have panic-sold everything after the first crash even if I had invested 2 years ago, so why should I bother thinking so much about this all.
Thanks for being concerned, anyway ;-)

I hope this doesn't come off as spam, but if you were interested in joining this project and have a dev background, you might be interested  in [ethereum]( a turing-complete cryptocurrency. 
Depending on your viewpoint, it might not be as ambitious as bitcloud, but it sure looks promising imho (and is the first cryptocurrency that I'd define as "2nd-gen", but I may not know enough altcoins to actually have a realistic opinion on that). 
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:09:11
Yeah, but the one for economics is often criticized (rightfully, imho) because it is not one of the real Nobel Prizes, but was instead "established in 1968 and endowed by Sweden's central bank, the Sveriges Riksbank, on the occasion of the bank's 300th anniversary." [(Source)](
It's seen by many as a mainstream economist circlejerk that uses the fame of the real Nobel Prizes. And it seems to work, since most people think it is an actual Nobel Prize.
But now that I re-read your reply, I see that maybe just found it funny that you wrote "price" instead of "prize" (which probably just means that you are not a native speaker, but hey, some people will still laugh).
@_date: 2014-01-30 00:21:06
That's why you never try to convince your friends when it comes to money.
They do not know that they would be safe holding, and might panic-sell, and who will be blamed? You.
So just don't do it imho, it's not worth it. Inform those who are actually interested, and leave the rest be, it's their decision.
@_date: 2014-01-17 11:26:14
Yeah, but it's hard to crash a multi-billion-dollar-market with just 23 million dollars... I mean, it sure would cause a dip, because people are always panic-selling, but that dip should not last long. 
Especially because there are probably a lot of people waiting for this dip, and hoping to buy when prices are low.

Not sure if it works or not, I've tried to use it once and it behaved strangely, so I just expected it to be broken (possibly in combination with one of my many other extensions) and moved on... Maybe I should try it again.

I am still kinda new to bitcoin (had forgotten about them for about 2 years, and recently started investing), but afaik a guy named cassius once made physical bitcoins that were pre-charged, and he had some trouble (probably legal trouble) with that concept.
So he doesn't charge them, they seem to be like a physical paper-wallet, if I understand it correctly (someone correct me if I am wrong please!)

So yeah, that sounds pretty much exactly like a slap on the wrist.

@_date: 2014-02-25 21:32:39
Yeah, I'd love to buy now, but noooo, I had to buy when it was over 1000 because I am retarded, and now I don't have enough cash left to buy again while it is so low (I'm thinking about saving more money to be able to buy more, and drastically lowering my standard of living, but in the end, it's all just money, so I shouldn't care that much about lost opportunities and just stop looking at the price until it has gone up again).

Your last sentence could well be worked into your analogy.
These outlandish sums of money could flow into the crypto-market in the next few years, but they could be spent on other cryptocurrencies (for example if there were some not yet discovered flaw in the bitcoin code, and people would seek out securecoin or stablecoin in hopes that they would be safer).

I hate apple, have never bought a product from them because I dislike their business practices as well as their style, but I don't think removing apple gift cards will really affect them much. It sends out a message, I understand that, but I think the message might appear to many as a childish knee-jerk reaction. 
Even if pock.io is big enough for apple to care, your paranoia is ridiculous. I'm sure you'll find more than enough vote-manipulation and corporate pseudo-grassroots campaigns on reddit, but that doesn't mean that everybody who disagrees with you is paid by apple.

I'm not sure about how it works since I don't have an account at coinbase, but you should look into it as to when it buys... 
Because if many people used that feature, and the standard settings say "buy at the first of every month" for example, then there would be a price spike at that time. 
It's a good idea in general, I just don't see how you could get it to work so that it would not buy if the price is too high, and is likely to go down (but that is of course always speculative, and you can never be sure, so maybe you shouldn't worry about that too much)
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:50:02
Because others are just downvoting you without explanation:
I don't have a link ready, but it was known for more than a year, a dev even said that it was not of any priority atm, because pretty much nobody uses this as a unique identifier... Well, nobody except mtgox, as we found out recently.
From what was said in the other threads this popped up, it seemed like the other exchanges were simply intelligent enough to work around this known issue, but mtgox's codebase seems not to have implemented anything like that, so they got hit hard.

@_date: 2014-01-15 14:06:27
I disagree here. I do believe there is a need for many, since we can learn from every coin that isn't just a cheap copycoin. 
A lot of coins like PrimeCoin, NameCoin or StableCoin bring something new to the table, and I still have no idea how many possibilities Ethereum (a turing-complete cryptocurrency) will bring us, but I'm excited to find out.
By watching the results of these differences, I believe we can learn a lot about the future of cryptocurrencies, which are still so new that it is unlikely that BitCoin is the "perfect" coin. 
I see it like evolution. It's not the goal to find one "perfect" animal, instead you have a great variety, with random mutations. Most of them die out eventually, and the ones who survive are sometimes radically different, but often live together in symbiosis, or at least coexist...
