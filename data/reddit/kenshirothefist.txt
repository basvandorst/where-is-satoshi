Important note for all sellers - providers
After extensive internal testing we can finally provide you with our own sgminer and cgminer builds.
As you probably already know, NiceHash is using some advanced stratum protocol features, therefore older mining software is not supported. We have prepared optimized sgminer and cgminer builds for you to get optimum performance when mining with GPUs on NiceHash. Of course, these builds will also work equally optimal on other pools.
Our builds includes patch for seamless order swaping without interupts, the idle bugfix as well as some other minor impovements.
Get the software here: 
Please, download our sgminer or cgminer binaries and please report if it is working well for you. We will apprechiate any feedback!
On our software download page you will also find links to latest BFGMiner builds with good GridSeed support (BFGminer 3.99.0) - hopefully Hashra and others will include the latest BFGminer in their software builds as soon as possible.
Thank you for using NiceHash!
