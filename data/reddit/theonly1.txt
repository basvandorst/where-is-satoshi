that means they solve the block concurrently into pieces?

Core of my question isn't about pool and their payment etc. Rather I'm interested more into the technicality how a block is solved when more than one miners are connected to a single daemon. From your answer it's parallel? That means even though you are connected to a single daemon where there are other miners as well but you are doing your own computations to solve the block? It's not that doing a joint work to solve the block?

Sorry I'm not clear about your point, you are saying no joint work but  your statement is contradicting when you said 
"the central coordinator might assign a range to each miner - like, miner A will try all nonce values starting with 0 while miner B tries all nonce values starting with 1, something like that."
That means they are working jointly to solve the block? Isn't it?

To further elaborate, for example I got 100 machines, should I connect them all to a single daemon node to mine or it's better to let them mine with their own daemon node each?

"to be clear, assembling the block with the transactions etc is like .00001% of the work, and can be done instantly. the other 99.9999% of the work is basically "now find a random number that luckily makes the final hash value of the block start with sixteen zeros." so it really is about trying tons of random numbers as fast as possible. a simple problem repeated many times, not a complex problem that calls for high-level coordination."
Yes I know but it's not the answer to my question, if in a pool of miners, they are doing this each on their own or they divide the work to be more specific?
