They serve the same general purpose. People will buy stocks hoping they go up in price and then sell them when they gain value

It is neither. It is like a stock market

Shares are almost never used for ownership of a company and are mainly just used to get a perceived value

No the narrative here is that bitcoin is the best at everything because everyone here needs to talk it up 24/7 to condone their poor decisions

Okay but you have no clue when that will plummet down and your bitcoin won't be worth anything. Gold is good because you can just buy it and let it sit there and centuries later the value of gold will never change. However bitcoin can just lose value because of memes.

It has pretty much only been going up in value until recently

Not really. Gold is something you can keep for centuries and it will still be about as valuable. Bitcoin is something that could go up in value or spontaneously people could stop caring about it and your gold is worth nothing. There is no security in bitcoin

I am shocked at how some people can take so little and get such an ego with it. You didn't overthrow anything. Most people will still use dollar bills instead of highly volatile crypto currencies that can lose all value in minutes. Basically all cryptocurrencies did is introduce a new form of stocks and stocks hardly overthrew banks

No. It is like this crazy system where you can put in money and like watch some kind of "market" for "stocks" that decides the prices of your "stocks" and it could go up or down in value. It is a pretty revolutionary idea that couldn't have been made centuries ago and this "market of stocks" will definitely crush the banking industry

US dollars are heavily backed by every government and their value is guaranteed. The value of bitcoin is like the value of stocks it is just speculation. If some group of idiots sees that bitcoin has increased in value then they buy loads of bitcoin then the value goes up but if they freak out when it dips then it goes down. Social media can decide the price of bitcoin so reddit is pretty valuable on its price

They don't store value when their value changes drastically by the hour. You can't rely on bitcoin because it can suddenly drop in value by thousands of dollars

I am trying to say that crypto currencies are not a practical currency to use and their only benefit is the potential to invest in them and have them go up in value which is something that has already been done before
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:48:51
Yes it is will just go down in value because somebody made a meme about over 9000 so then people cash in at over 9000 usd causing it to go down in value. The issue is nothing is backing the value of bitcoin other than public opinion. It is just digital code that people can decide if it has value or not, at the end of the day bitcoin has no real value outside of what people give it

Okay but you are still suggesting a completely absurd situation. Those banks are rich as shit and if they can’t get their stuff back online then I don’t think we stand much of a chance in the world anyways
@_date: 2018-11-21 13:53:49
Are you seriously suggesting that bitcoin is the superior currency solely because of its use after we get nuked?
