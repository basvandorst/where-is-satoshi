KYC in the middle would be technically not possible.
Protocol itself ensures that each hub only knows hop which sends funds to it, next hop and amount.
But there is no information available from where the sum originates or where is its final destination. Or even how many hops there are.

i was doing a little shorting yesterday @ around 11.3k
waited for a dip that did not happen. and was exposed entire day.
in the evening thought ok lets put a stop buy and went to smoke. 
coming back from smoking it had rised to 11.8k 
Litterally if i had stalled one more minute and did not place stop buy , would of been screwed :)

Not exactly a point to add but agree.
Buying Bitcoin ETF versus Bitcoin is same as 
buying Gold ETF instead of gold.
ETF versions of both are just some questionable value paper contracts.  If S should hit the F you better have some real things in your own possession. 
It forces more people to learn that best is to be in control of your own investments. Any kind of ETFs, Funds, and all "proffessional investment vehicles" are mainly intended for their managers to get rich on management fees.
And in reality they are just a middleman leeches. 
(Why limit yourself with BTC ETF that you can trade in one platform during business hours while real thing you can trade everywhere in the world from hundreds of exchanges to face to face meetup. ) 
4) No ETF provides opportunity for regular Joe to get in before WS Fat Cat

If Alice would need to be a miner to attempt double spend.
Which most likely is not the case.
But even then Bob would just need to wait for block confirmations to be sure that hes transaction is valid.
Confirmations just mean that you can see your transaction in the block and there are additional blocks already mined on top of this block so no one is able to reverse it anyhow,

Ok how will this work?
I believe if some miner would mine segwit block Today then all nodes would reject it both BIP148 and all segwit supporting core nodes.
So what changes when BIP148 deadline is reached and Segwit block is mined. I understand that then still all core nodes would reject this block even as they support segwit?
Or do i understand something wrong here?
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:01:30
But it is also not about L1 ability to compete. 
As you can see there is opposition to L2 and Segwit. 
Yes L1 scalability is also needed.  But why we have to do it forcefully.
If you look Segwit at short term it is all about L1 scalability. 
L2 is not even functional.
And on long term we all know that L1 needs further scalability.
But why do we need to create risks. 
For example this 75% HW treshold is like intentionally asking for trouble. 
And another thing usually if different implementations are made.
A party makes its addition. But on current state it seems that BU effort is to spread the branches so apart that it is intentionally creating two species that can not make babies. 
So yes L1 needs to scale and L2 is needed.
And sorry Bitcoin should create new economy. That means that there must be many pies to split among many parties. 
Which is better for the world one trillionaire or million millionaires?
 
EDIT: One additional thing. 
We have to look also outside Bitcoin.  Lets forget about this internal civil war. 
It is not just important to make some decision inside Bitcoin. (satisfy miners/ satisfy users/ satisfy core/satisfy BU whatever.)  This decision must have competitive advantage also over outside parties. 
Lets take purely hypothetical stance.  
For example if i would be Bitcoin competitor. I would just dream of seeing such internal fight in Bitcoin.  Would just follow quietly and laugh and pick best features and put those together and then come out with everything running smoothly and probably with ultimate efficiency. 
We are making war in the middle of war.
So i guess we are actually all idiots.

Yes possibly, 
Question is if not announced transactions should have any place in the block.

I personally support segwit but would not mind some bigger blocks as well. 
The problem is that there is no available option to signal or support both. If there would be i am sure that such client would get majority support and we finally could move on.
Current path leads to 50/50 split which in my opinion is worst possible outcome.
95/5 fork seems like acceptable risk considering any alternatives. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:56:21
So donating to some entities who deal with this daily is a bad idea?
I did my share of GPU mining in the past , so no problems setting up the rig. 
But consider following:
1) my power is expensive
2) high power asic in my appartment living room would make my life intolerable.
3) all not technical people would have an issue to make this happen.
So would it not be more economical to participate helping competent party to set up serious facility in good location. 
Obviously by donating i am not expecting any return of investment on this except for trying to prevent BTC massacare.
Your approach would work if those nice small USB miners were available. But as i see those are all years behind.
Antminer 9 is  0.098 W/Gh 
best small USB variants are 33 times less efficient and even 100 times less efficient. 
So i hope you realize that me running solo would basically mean that instead of contributing to BTC i would contribute to global warming instead. :D

This sub reddit has 212,313 readers.
BU supporting miners have announced that they have 100Million to throw at fighting.
It would take 10 000 of us with 1BTC  to counter that (~5 % of this subreddit)
or 20 000 of us with 0,5BTC to counter that (10% of this subreddit)
So if all those posts here about the economic majority have any kind of base. it must be possible to crowd fund any amount of support.
I definitely can not run such project. but i guess that there must be some candidates in this 212,313 users who could pull this off.

I can imagine something like that:
Lets assume the current scalability debate is over and path is freed up for second layer protocols.
Then i see that L2 would bring good scalability to amount of transactions. But i see this L2 used between majority of bigger hubs/exchanges/remittance processors etc.
Not sure if it would be ever useful for end user to use L2 directly. 
So one immediate approach is to use those hubs as custodial. But i see that this would not be preferred option. 
As a end user i would still like to park my holdings behind private key that i control.
So i think that maybe some smaller , lets say "locally significant" blockchains come into play.
So for example i have my holdings controlled by me. In a chain that is pegged to bitcoin blockchain.
If i make a transaction it first goes to some local hub.
Local hub is handling bulk sidechain to btc chain transactions and is also a member of lightning implementation. So my sidechain tokens are converted to btc, and transported other side of the world over Lightning , where another hub is converting it to another user local blockchain. 
And this overall concept requires some Layer 3 addressing. 
At least to me seems logical. 
Climbing the OSI model approach :)

How far is the routing and how is it done now?
As i understand each node has a full table of channels.
Does the sending node calculate best path. And includes this path trail with transaction. Or the end destination is known to all and each nexthop makes its own decision ?
@_date: 2017-03-31 07:20:42
So she could broadcast a transaction to bob to network. So Bob sees the transaction but it is not confirmed.
On the same time Alice , provided that she has unthinkable amount of mining power attempts to mine a block where she adds this transaction to herself.
Then first advertised transaction to Bob would be invalid.
But considering the effort that Alice would need to make this happen it is not feasible. Unless Bobs sells alice a country and for some reason is ok with zero confirmation transaction. :)

Running a node will not give you any bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:46:11
Rule 1 
If you do not control the private key , then you do not own your Bitcoin.
Rule 2 
Every computer is hackable. 
So you treat any mobile wallet like cash in your pocket.
You might get drunk in a bar and lose it or some pickpocketer gets it. use those for reasonable amount of BTC needed for some period or some actions.
For long term storage investigate HW wallets and paper wallets. Paper wallets are cheap but you need to know how to handle those. (for example when you make a transaction out of them you must withraw all! , there is no change address there ) 
Regarding hw wallets its a bit of investment but trezor is something to recommend , really easy and secure and simple. 
Rule 3 
Dual factor auth is a must. In every portal that holds any of your BTC
Ok those few words should keep you reading for a week at least.

Misconception it is pseudonymous not anonymous.
It is not linked to your ID but you are leaving traces of you with each purchase. It is almost like leaving fingerprints or pieces of DNA of yourself everywhere and claiming no one can identify me. While this might be true when no authority has your fingerprint or DNA in their database yet. But once they have all your previous actions are bacically written in "stone" (read blockchain).  
BTC will change from pseudonymous to more anonymous in the near future for sure.

Must say i have never mined bitcoin. Did some altcoins few years ago. But such question seems strange , "cheapest  build for ant miner s7"  ant miner is a full product you just buy it or not buy it.  Only thing you need is a power supply unit that can feed this thing. And there might be some options to select different PSU.
When i was doing some GPU mining i used some leftover 2kw  Server PSU on which i did some modifications to save on PSU costs.
I think PSU is the only component where something if any can be saved.

If you make a transaction you just need to check that address you see on browser matches the one which is shown on trezor screen. 
If they match then all is ok. If there is a mismatch then it could be that browser plugin or third party application is compromized.
Same way is when you generate new address in trezor wallet. before you send any funds to it you press the check box that it would display the address on trezor screen. So you make sure that you are sending funds to correct address not to some fake address shown to you in browser.
Upgrading trezor device itself , trezor device warns you that firmware signature does not match.
So as long as you check every transaction address there should be no problems.

At least as far as i have seen , all Dumps and Pumps chinese exchanges are in the lead and US exchanges follow.
I believe that all this dumping currently is just related to two things.
Firstly the end of year race was unsustainable and heavily leveraged. So correction was needed.
Liquidation of leveraged positions just amplified this correction
Secondly PBoC rumors and their auditing of exchanges creating some uncertainty. 
I think for BTC it is enough to make decent amount of volatility.

To be sure you are secure the general steps are following.
* Make some bootable USB stick. Basically can be any linux iso. Or live cd or whatever.  (So you have temporary live operations system which is not compromised any way.)
* Download paper wallet generator to some usb stick.
* Boot any PC or laptop up from this bootable USB stick.
Do not enable any network connection.
* generate wallet on this PC and print it.
All this might sound as overkill but it ensures that:
* you have fresh system where you can be sure are no viruses or any other security risks
* you are not connected to internet while generating wallet , also to avoid any security risks.
As computer security experts say, if computer is in internet , assume it is compromised :)

Hmm, well i have allways been on segwit+lightning scaling camp. But in my opinion the arguments against block size increase were allways related to aspects that HF  is contentious and possibly disruptive.
I think there is nothing wrong with 2mb, it is conservative and reasonable number. And also it does not mean that all blocks will be 2Mb. But as bip91 activation showed us. It is possible to make so called signalling activation, so the real fork activation can have 100% support.

@_date: 2016-11-24 15:24:11
Can anyone explain me following.
Lets assume that Segwit activates and Lightning network is ready and can be in its full potential.
I understand following:
* Lightning can have huge transaction trough put as transactions are not recorded to blockchain.
* As transactions are not recorded to blockchain all the transactions are kept in a live online environment.
* Transactions can be settled to blockchain in case of some event where some servers go offline or channels have to be closed for some reason. And that assumes that there has to be some aggregation win other vise amount of transactions which need to be settled is same overwhelming as it would be now to push thousands or millions of transactions to blockchain.
So where comes this aggregation win.
In case of exchange to exchange transactions i can imagine that there could be thousands of transactions exchange to exchange and those could be settled with one transaction once a day or whatever period.
But in case of regular people transacting.
Does that mean that for regular people the concept of cold storage for example loses meaning, as you can not cold storage Lightning account state.
Does this mean that only way to keep some bitcoin balance is to have custodial account somewhere. And only those big hubs/banks have access to Bitcoin L1 network as they are able to aggregate meaningful amount of transactions.  
So basically peer to peer transacting for people loses its meaning?  Being your own bank loses its meaning?
Does this mean that if i as a person hold bitcoin in cold storage will be pushed out of holding bitcoin in such a way.
For example wanting to send one bitcoin to someone and then discover that as Layer 1 bitcoin is settlement network for big custodial entities and it might be that considering fees the smallest reasonable amount to send over Layer 1 Bitcoin network could be thousands of bitcoins?
Or am i totally misunderstanding all of this?
EDIT: That does not mean that such path would not be aiding bitcoin adoption and usefulness.

Well in the beginning yes it reduces maybe some load from L1 and puts some load to L2 which by aggregating transactions can have some efficiency. 
But what i usually do is try to project things further in time. And there i reach the understanding that if there is any kind of BTC adoption x fold. Then only way there can be such efficiency is by big L2 entities holding most of the accounts.

actually you do, i have silver coins, and they must be also in individual plastic casings. and you can get screwed.
for example i had some coins i wanted to sell, those were in tubes of twenty. it was cold outside and when i presented those they probably started condensing a bit as i entered warm room. so company that purchased them started talking that yes those arw oxydized etc and can only pay silver spot price etc.
so yes not very easy.
another problem with gold and silver is that how tha he do you verify that it really is silver or gold. 
carry laboratory with you?
crypto solves that problem. btc is btc

Thank You for links.
Definitely good sources 
But i still find several issues. Most of the methods require quite much knowledge from counter parties. And need quite active management.
For example they would need to be aware of protocol or store some PINs ,seeds on their own. 
Most likely i would then need to train all the participants regularly like yearly disaster recovery excersise :D 
I would prefer to have some anchor points that can be used in worst case scenarios. For example in last will scenario, or scenario when i get hit to head and forget all my own passphrases and access methods.
Let say i have  last will held by lawyer .
And only thing it states is following: There is a box in location A
And it can be opened when two persons from subset of XYZ are present.
Only thing they might remember is that at some point i scanned their fingerprints and told them that it is for my will. So there is nothing for them to remember , nothing for them hold or to lose. And sequence of events is initiated by lawyer.
So when those 2 persons open the device it just instructs them to insert fingerprints. And from there device will guide them trough all the rest.
From guides and keys how to access all my sites and digital identity  to guides how to access BTC etc. 
(In addition there could be some funny additional locks like they need to bring device to specific location and it accepts their fingerprints only when GPS coordinates are matching etc.)

If it would be legit the company would be bitcoin exchange or at least use bitcoin exchange. 
Why would they send money to some person in another country who uses bitcoin ATM. 
You do not know where the money is coming from. 
could be some legit money, drug money, laundering. 
Anyway there are endless possibilities for such company to offer exchange services , without paying thousands to some random person.

True bitcoin social media is full of bulls. and yes it is also a circus.
but compared to full media it is very small minority. 
So if we take overall (finance world) picture then bitcoin bulls are most likely 0.1% meaning 99.9% are bears or have absolutely no clue. 
For example 97.4 % of males are heterosexual. 
and we can see what this 2.6% vocal minority has done to silent majority.

"According to the U.S. Geological Survey, silver is about 17.5 times more abundant than gold in the earth's crust"
"Combined geological, aggregate mining data, and verifiable historical record show that about 190,000 metric tonnes of gold and some 1.6 million tonnes of silver have been mined physically throughout history"
If we talk about bullion then it is estimated that between all the vaults in the world there is 2.5 billion ounces of gold and 2.78 billion ounces of silver.

We already have:
Block Signalling
Node Signalling
Coin dance and other political polls.
I think another form of voting gives nothing.
How is the enforcing part done. If everyone still needs to install some node or miner implementation to read the vote output and cause some action then they can also just install UASF node and be done with it.

just wondering why dont we have some option to verify authentic trezor via blockchain. 
i believe there could be many workable options. 
example , when buying trezor , trezor could fund some btc address (10usd ) from known source and include private key with package. 
when you receive it you verify from where it is funded and swipe it so copying the code would not work. 
this was just example could be much better approaches

I would run this node.
1. Community split - Riskiest
2. 95%HF+Segwit - Moderate Risk
3. Segwit - Low risk
As path 3 looks unobtainable, and by default we are on path 1 , then path 2 looks to be only viable option.

Why do you think you are using electricity of mining site.
Web mining still just means that miner is browser based and uses your PC do do the calculations. 
So even if you are using just laptop which is not able to draw much power.
It is still the case that whatever power your laptop is drawing costs more than any possible mining gains. 
Or is it that kind of mining where you click some adds or complete surveys etc. and are paid with bitcoin?
In that case it is not much about electricity but rather throwing away your time basically for nothing.  Would suggest to calculate income per hour  rate. Most likely you could do anything else besides this activity to gain better income per h rate.
