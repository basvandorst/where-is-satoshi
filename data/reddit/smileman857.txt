Not sure who you used but my bank does it for $14.50 flat fee for any amount to most places.

When I send WUs worldwide it arrives instantly unless WU flags it for an audit.

“Days” aka minutes.

Yeah weekends are a thing and is a valid argument and needs to change. I never said otherwise. Fiat should be faster but banks have a right to do transactions as safety as they can when they are the ones liable if your moneys stolen.

Trust me, as someone who works in a bank, we do not like regulations. 80% of my job are random regulatory crap. Switching to crypto would make my life so much easier. 
And banks would survive, IMO. Banks lend money. People will still need money, crypto or fiat.

Up to, yes. It depends on a lot of factors. I’ve seen it take 5 days when it goes to a “high risk” country. But those delays aren’t bank side. Funds typically leave the bank instantly unless it flags for manual security review. It’s the big bad governments slowing those down, for whatever reason.

Naw just carry a CC. Most are fee-free these days. Bitcoin failed and no one takes it seriously anymore.

Let’s learn to be realistic. 
If crypto ever becomes mainstream all the banks will just adapt to it. 90+% of transactions in America are already electronic. Banks are slow to change because they have no competition, but they will when they have too. Debit cards didn’t destroy banks, and the concept is essentially identical to crypto.

I literally send wires as a job. The hold up with wires is entirely security verification bank side and foreign governments. I’ve sent a million dollar escrow domestically and confirmed it arrived within minutes at the other bank. I’ve sent millions to England from the US and it arrived that afternoon. 
The safeguards can feel sluggish but they exist because the people sending the funds are the ones liable, so they take caution to ensure they don’t lose out. If your “business” was liable for a fraud bank wire you could be bankrupt with one compromise. A single hacker could destroy your entire business in a minute. Using a bank makes that impossible, or at least significantly less likely. 
It’s obvious you’re out of your depth here.

Everyone knows this. It’s not a secret. 
Your money is insured, up to a generous amount. If you (lol) have more than 200k just split it up between accounts. You have literally no risk of losing it.

And that’s fine. If crypto is the better currency then we’ll be better off.

This is so... ugh. Clueless. 
You are allowed to keep your money under your bed. In a safe in your closet. In your car. 
You choose to use a bank instead (for good reason). Yes it’s your money, but your account is their property. Your vcc and cc is their property. This is told to you up front, in bold letters. It’s written on your card in bold letters. 
The bank (and visa, etc) protects you from fraud. If someone breaks into your house and steals your $20,000 in savings you’re shit out of luck. If someone steals your identity and gets your $20,000 from the bank you’re reimbursed, sometimes in minutes or days. 
That kind of protection requires safe guards that you’ll have to learn to deal with if you want that safety net. They give you access to use their systems and yes, you have to have permission if you’re doing weird shit with it. 
Yes, they can deny you sending money overseas, because you’re using their systems, or the systems they contract with. Why the hell you feel so entitled to use someone else’s transfer systems with no safeguards is beyond me. If you don’t want to deal with it you can fly your money to India yourself. No ones stopping you. 
I can see it now. You’re the type to bitch about “too much protection, I should be allowed to do whatever I want” but you’re also the first to complain when your account gets compromised, even if it’s your own fault.

Yeah it’s not a currency, sorry.
