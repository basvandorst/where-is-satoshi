"And when people were allowed to do that, they took down the rest of the market with them."
Care to back this opinion up with facts? Really think it had nothing to do with Glass-Steagall?
Or Gauss-Chern-Bonnet Theorem???
"SEC regulations have more to do with how companies solicit their securities and report their financials, than what someone is allowed to invest in. It's a subtle, but important, distinction." 
Spoken as someone who hasn't had their successful trades reversed by the SEC for arbitrary reasons. The stock market is a scam for taking money from average joes.. the moment you win, they take it all away. They just want to make sure the money keeps flowing upwards and anything else is a bald-faced lie.

Again, both of these points are completely moot because of blockchain and smart contract technology. But please go on repeating the same nonsense by all means.

And as people keep repeating, they want the right to take the risk or win the reward. They no longer want the SEC deciding they have the right to "protect" them.. it's a bullshit excuse as others have pointed out.. these regs are outdated and need to be challenged. You people keep talking about shareholders and voting, etc... hello this is what the blockchain is fucking for! Transparency, voting, escrow to protect the funds etc... Sweet Jesus, come off it already

To be fair Facebook and Google were started by DARPA not "by a college kid in his dorm room" ..kids in dorm rooms don't have racks of servers to scale-lets stop repeating this myth. The original idea and work was done by Adam D'Angelo(Quora) and co-opted by blueblood Zuckerberg.
