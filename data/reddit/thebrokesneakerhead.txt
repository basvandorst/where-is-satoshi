@_date: 2017-08-13 16:07:17

@_date: 2017-08-13 16:13:45
I just wanted to know if 800 worth of btc is a good option to acquire right now because ofc.. all time high. Ofc i want it as an investment option, dont want the 800 right now
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:34:16
How did you split your coins? I transferred the coins (i had in electrum during fork) to a mobile wallet. What now?
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:03:56
How did you get your bch on kraken. I have my btc kept in electrum. Sorry if this was a stupid question buy im really confused
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:14:31
No idea on how to sell it. Just have my btc on electrum. Idk what to do
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:03:45
Well, many people are talking about the correction which might happen soon, it's kinda scary
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:37:30
Will a different user on the same pc work? Moreover i have like 0.000066 btc left im electrum, that wouldn't an issue right?
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:21:50
Why do i need to transfer my btc to another wallet? :/
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:26:33
So i guess we cannot claim the free money and when we would be able to, it probably would have lost it's value 
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:21:04
So well, how do i sell my bch?
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:09:55
@_date: 2017-10-04 07:24:04
Following the question
@_date: 2017-10-04 07:23:21
What happened
@_date: 2017-10-04 07:22:47
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:30:58
And one more stupid question, what if i lose access to the pc i have electrum installed. Will just the seed help me recover my wallet or there is something else that needs to be kept in hand?
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:58:43
Thanks man (: 
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:29:06
Thanks a lot man. This 1st august has stressed me out, and pretty sure i am not alone. Bought all the coins during all time highs so pretty stressed
