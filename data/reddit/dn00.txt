You and I... We have tab problems.

It's best to have the lawyer talk if they intend to sue any way.

Any site can be used to distribute cp. The difference is if the people running the site does anything about it or not.

This happens with some people's normal bank account too. Usually doesn't stick.

Buying in all out during an all time high price? I hope you have balls of hardened stainless steel when the correction happens. You'd have a higher chance of making out with a head full of hair with alt coins instead.

This prophesized epic dump was disappointing. I wanted to buy more.

Coinbase should've consulted with an expert before adding a scamcoin to their exchange. I came back after holding BTC and LTC for years and noticed there's more elitism now than fans rooting for innovation. I read somewhere that the cryptocurrency community matured from 3 years ago, but it doesn't seem that way.
@_date: 2017-05-07 13:39:37
Funny you said that.
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:35:32
In terms of software engineering, it is.
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:08:36
I made up the numbers but there's a thread  of a guy in the exact same situation I gave.
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:42:48
Mainstream is when Amazon and my local 7/11 accepts Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-09 03:39:34
Yeah, that's probably why certain exchanges have eth and are adding ltc. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:45:52
Most here wouldn't acknowledge it.
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:53:48
Look into Litecoin instead. Bitcoin has issues, especially for smaller investments.
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:55:34
This is why BTC will never go mainstream in its current state.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:43:56
Yes but you will need to remember the password you set when you turn on backup. Backup is off by default so make sure you turn it on.
@_date: 2017-06-09 03:40:00
Money comes before innovation amiright.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:25:27
That's a face I'd like to punch.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:57:38
Man that really sucks. This kinda deter me from make any purchases with bitcoins but I've always been paranoid about money handling. Upvote in hope of that guy seeing this post.
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:50:14
Nice referral link.

Tell PayPal you got hacked if it takes saying so to get your money back. Do whatever you can. Don't give up. Good luck.

It's a really useful app. Made me aware of my spending.
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:57:17
I wish it was 20%...
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:59:15
Now imagine someone buying 1 mBTC and sending it to another address. He'd be rediculed when he asks why the fee is half of his mBTC.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:49:28
It's rising the same as bitcoins did. If it was pumped and dumped, the price would be back to $10-20 by now. It's not too late to double your bitcoins holding with litecoins =)
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:28:18
I didn't read your whole story (it's damn long) but I would change my story if it means I can get my money back. You could say the hacker took over your computer, used it as a proxy, went into your account, open and closed a dispute so that you can't open another one. If I was scammed, I'd fight back dirty. You didn't hear that from me though. Good luck.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:30:04
But really, just be a nice person and return it.
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:36:55
Just look for threads that talks about advantages of altcoins and disadvantages of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:15:04
Use authy so it backup your accounts.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:40:51
Damn you have no clue on what you're talking about. Random things start breaking when a site is getting hammered. Even if the frontend seems fine, there might be problems with the backend. Obviously there were communication problems between coinbase and their bank even though the website seems fine. You need to get that through to your head and stop spamming pointless complaints.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:57:08
Call your bank and tell them to block coinbase transactions. It's like banning yourself from the website but if you're gonna break a commitment, might as well.
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:00:11
I'd invest half... Keep the other half.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:40:08
DId you save your keys or QR code?
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:43:12
Well if you have funds in the account. Just send in a ticket and they'll send you a link to remove the authentication. You'll have to wait 2 weeks to log back in after that.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:16:04
So they're buying 20 coins at 700, then sell them at 500. They're losing money?
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:42:06
Can't access the internet without a computer.

He transferred them from offline wallet.

You use Authy so all your sites are backed up. Don't even wait to download Authy. Just do it now.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:59:31
Hey now, no need to be hostile =)
@_date: 2013-11-15 08:13:21
If you have a smartphone, get the Mint app. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:31:13
I think a lot of people who sold at 800, bought more at 600...
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:36:08
Compare the price when you started studying the market and compare that price to today's price. There's your answer.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:54:03
So ironic =P
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:17:47
You could just use apps that circumvents the notification.
