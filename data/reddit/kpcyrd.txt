Isn't this a gdpr violation? Any way to do something about that?

I would expect Signal to go with monero or zcash, if any.

A lot of people do it to seed the blockchain to other people.

You're going to have problems if you pick the words yourself. Never do this. Make sure the words for your paper wallet are picked with a csprng. There's a lot of confusion about dictionary attacks and people thinking they apply here. By the same logic all passwords are insecure because an attacker knows all the 256 possible combinations a byte can have.
Let's take a sufficiently large dictionary (cracklib-small, 54763 words) and calculate the odds. Let's go yolo mode and roll with 12 words. This is `54763**12` (54763 to the power of 12) and equals to 727523082681180378287184901627297602988267173735415806481 possible combinations. All of them are equally likely if you they are picked with cryptographically secure randomness. This number is larger than all possible keys you can have for 128 bit encryption (`2**128` = 340282366920938463463374607431768211456).
If we go further and pick 24 words, this number is significantly larger (`54763**24` = 529289835833927620882843989234989058689699048517602447522257718592140898207921729201841246765822304848099641603361). This number is so large, it's bigger than all possible outputs you can have with SHA256 (`2**256` = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936), which is the constraint of how many bitcoin addresses can possibly exist. In other words, it'd be more efficient to just generate random private keys and check if they have a balance.
Please learn to math.

In addition, if I'd ask you "can you mine me a bitcoin if I pay you $1 to do it?" Your reply would be "no" because it wouldn't cover the costs of mining it.
