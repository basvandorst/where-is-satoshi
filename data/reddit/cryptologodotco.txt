I appreciate your response. But I don't understand anything you wrote, honestly. If that's what we're talking about here.
Maybe that's on me that I didn't configure modems, but I'm a creative and educated (for arguments sake, no flex here) - so different industry and definetly not something you can show a laymen and just assume they would understand BBSes and 2400-7E1. 
I don't know why everyone is being all, "I can't believe you didn't know this". My 2 cents worth anyways. Continue.

Tether news was a pretty big deal man, and on top of that it is a controversy - juicy juicy goss. If BTC hits 10k then that is an all time high worth really sharing in my mind.

My point is, e-mail has evolved from what 'seems' to be rather technical to the non-early adopters (and this being more hardware dependent in your case, now not to focus on just the instructions). Today, we send email seamlessly, replacing letter mail primarily - is now adopted and utilised daily, in 2015 showing 205 billion emails per day.
Now, all i wanted to say is that - bitcoin - if seen as complicated now for adoption and daily utilisation to the non-early adopters, replacing fiat primarily - can be adopted and utilised daily in a similar fashion to the prior. ~~Keep your money my dude~~, and have my two cents.
Edit: You weren't even offering me $100, but offering to consider my argument - my bad brutha.
@_date: 2019-02-06 14:24:58
Yeah for sure, thanks for explaining.
My point is partially this. You need to explain to reddit users how to send email back then. And now you wouldn't need to tell a reddit user how to send an email.
I hope that bitcoin has the same fate. That it will become so seamless in the future and grow to mass adoption and utility in the near future.
@_date: 2019-02-06 14:00:59
Haha, I am not offended by it and happy you said that actually. 
I just didn't want all these ostracising comments by you oldies, but rather wanted to talk about how history can repeat in a soft sense.
What seems to be 'high tech' for its time (for some of us), adopted its way to mainstream and now used by little kids to old grandmas. The mother frickin' e-mail boys and girls!

Stack slowly bretheren. You'll get there in no time in the bear market.
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:47:32
Agreed - alternatively, it's time for adoption, and building a stronger community during the bearish market.

Yes you're right, but you need to look at economic theory of chaos rather than order. We are preceded from animals and our society/education systems acts as a framework of normality and archetypes of what is human, including fiat, tax and societal benefits - but we are very competent and also communal beings, yet we live in fear and repetition - 40 hours a week between 4 walls to pay a mortgage etc.
The tax we pay is going in many directions (many on many), when you leave society in a state of chaos, the rich eventuate to looking after the poor to create a balance and not need for a government to shadow this responsibility and domesticating us from our potential. 
Another crude fact is that equality had led us to overpopulation and benefits that are being wasted to not progress as a community - lots to think about here and many risks to take for economic and liberal freedom. It's not us against us, it's us against the governing bodies we feel safe and warm within. This is food for thought, happy for your opinion upon this.
