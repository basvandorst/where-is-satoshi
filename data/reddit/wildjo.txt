Yes.  Windows, sadly.  Working on getting up to speed with Linux.  I'm an old fart.
Anyway, moved file into the directory.  turned off hidden folders, but nothing new showed.  And, no new balance once inserted .dat file into new directory.  Does the .dat file need a specific name. Currently just "wallet.dat"? 
@_date: 2015-12-10 05:46:59
I have a backup file, but it's a couple weeks old.  No transactions during that time however.  Once I have new wallet synched, do I just copy that backup file in the new wallet directory?  Really appreciate any advice.

  Great, except the guy says:
" For one, the cost of processing [BTC] transactions, while free or almost free to the transactor, is rather costly and much more costly than other transaction mechanisms..."
@_date: 2014-01-30 16:44:12
Fiat/inflationary currency systems depend on ever increasing debt and ever increasing growth to service that debt.  That is why they all ultimately fail, particularly when resources are finite and negative impacts are externalized (e.g. environmental degradation).  Moreover, those systems benefit a small group at the expense of the majority via tax and fee systems exacted as a toll to participate in said systems.
Hoarding can be a characteristic, but only when there is a surplus.  Once there is wider adoption fewer BTC will be hoarded because they will be used for day-to-day necessary transactions.  BTC will also be used for non-necessities due to low transaction fees and frictionless transfer over long distances.  BTC will move back and forth between peers and there would be no need to board other than logical saving for future purchases and financial cushions.
Edit: "board" to "hoard".  Damn autocorrect.

The writing was on the wall last year.  Four months ago, MK and Mt.Gox were warned of the very vulnerability they now site as being the cause of the "leak".  They had the time, opportunity and resources to fix the problem (as all other exchanges have done).  They chose not to.  Moreover, they had the responsibility to do everything they could--to be cutting edge--in protecting client funds/assets.  They willfully and utterly failed.
Then, when their recklessness and negligence comes to light, they try to throw Bitcoin under the bus by blaming the protocol?!  
"The poor guy tried his best"?  Bull crap.  They didn't even try to be average.  They/he was warned of the vulnerability.  They ignored it.  
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:42:45
Coins still being created.  For price to remain same, need new money invested to buy those new coins that miners are selling.  So, fact that price staying in a narrow band, despite Gox fiasco, is good sign.  Means more investment every day.  For price to go up, need additional new money every day (to absorb new coins).  I don't see why that won't happen as Gox sensationalism fades away and we can focus on all the good news being generated daily.

You need to hook up with a BTC venture capital group like BitAngels.  They have the experience and legal resources to guide you.  You've got all kinds of regulatory concerns and with players from all of the world, you've got numerous legal jurisdictions to consider, with U.S. and EU being the more problematic.  But, the concept is cool and since you have a track record with an earlier version, you might have a good shot at getting into one of the several BTC VC incubators.  I think that is really the best way to have the resources to gain some sense of regulatory piece of mind.
One last thought is that you need to make sure your former partner is either on board, or assigns to you any rights he has or may have in the game based on his earlier participation.

I'm seriously considering the switch.  Glad to hear you are happy with your decision. 
As for keeping up to 3 btc on a phone, me thinks that's crazy.  Maybe .3 btc, but i'd never put more in an online wallet than I would feel comfortable carrying cash in my back pocket through a dicey neighborhood.  
But, maybe they're in the uber 1% and need a few thousand on hand for those impulse purchases.
@_date: 2014-01-08 13:26:06
I agree.  You have to compare it to the cost of creating, maintaining, distributing and protecting fiat currency and the legacy banking system.  Once you do that, environmentalists should embrace Bitcoin as its environmental footprint must be vastly smaller.

Tax and fee systems may be present in a BTC economy, but the fees are exponentially lower and aren't charged on all transactions.  Tax is a necessary evil in a fiat system and enforcement is much easier with AML and KYC requirements.  Enforcement much harder and not a necessary part of a BTC economy.
Why would people convert to the local fiat currency, if they can use BTC?  Makes no sense.  Pay small fee on BTC conversion and large fee (via tax, inflation, and, possibly, transfer fees).  Faith in fiat is eroding.  Faith in government institutions is eroding.  Both for good reason.  With broader adoption of BTC, I see fiat playing less and less a role (which is why most governments, particularly the U.S., will likely and ultimately be antagonistic towards cryptocurrencies).
@_date: 2014-01-21 15:03:37
It's got to become even easier to buy.  Look at how many--"How can a brotha get a bitcoin"--posts there are just in this subredit.
Also, given that BTC still being created every ten minutes, I read somewhere that it requires about $60 million in new money to invest in BTC every month to keep the price from falling.  Not sure if those numbers are correct, but the fundamental issue (need lots of new money every month or price will fall) seems sound.

I've tried the lifehacker podcast, and it is almost unlistenable most of the time.  To make matters worst, at least two of the hosts are hostile toward bitcoin, even though they acknowledge they don't know much about it.  I just wish folks would wait to voice an opinion until it is an informed one.

Just because others haven't had problems doesn't mean you won't.  By far, most of the account closures have come from the bigger, chain banks.  Getting your account closed is a hassle, so prepare for it up front.  And, if your are preparing by getting a second account at another bank (which is the smartest play), then go with a credit union.  Of all the problems I've heard or read about, only a fraction have been with credit unions.
Personally, I'd get away from chase anyway.  But, if I had both, I'd make the credit union my BTC account and the other for day-to-day.

Banks stopping withdrawals or closing is still a win.  They exist on a thin thread of confidence.

Regulation is government picking a side, either in the actual regs or in the enforcement.  The side they pick is--these days-- always the side with the money.  That's why the TBTF banks have merely had their hands slapped, if that, when fraud after fraud is uncovered.  
Far more fraud is occurring with fiat currency, despite regulation.  There's nothing that regulation can give us that the community can't self-generate over time. 
You open the door to government regulation and BTC ceases to be BTC.  Keep the reigns and self-organize.  The community and the core dev is doing just fine on their own.  We don't need federal/national government imprimatur to be legitimate.

Too many people have a vested interest in Bitcoin's success at this point.  Combined with the network effect, this gives Bitcoin a nearly overwhelming advantage, particularly in your short time frame.  If Bitcoin failed at this point, all crypto currencies would be damaged for a long while.  No cryptocurrency could recover within a year to replace Bitcoin.
I do think Bitcoin's success will create space for other cryptocurrencies.  But, they need Bitcoin to be successful in order to thrive, not fail.

I see this as the biggest obstacle to more widespread adoption by mainstream business communities.  Unless you are a BTC bull, you are likely to be reluctant to start excepting BTC because the volatility introduces more risk/uncertainty.  Only once BTC stabilizes (either in a narrow price range or long term upward with no deep valleys) will it become more appealing to commercial entities.  Of course, it's a chicken and egg problem, as commercial/business adoption is one of the major ways to achieve that stability/growth.

If BTC gains widespread adoption, you will be well off with a few BTC.  Remember, there will only ever be 21 million BTC.  That's like 0.03 or less for each and every person.

And, it's a shame.  All BFL had to do was communicate and not be such pricks.  I don't think they intended to be a scam, but, at this point, they might as well be.  Same end result.

No one knows what btc will do in usd.  Too many factors and too much volatility in btc market.  
If I had no btc right now, I'd buy a couple and look for other ways to accumulate btc other than cash.  I'd be looking for a price below $100 before I start thinking of buying more.
The price could very well go back up to $260 before it goes down to $100, but both are likely to be seen in the near future.  It could also go to $1000 or $0.001 and stick.  Who knows?  Generally, though, I'm a fan.

You don't indicate where you are located.  If you are in the U.S., you could file a civil complaint against a "Jane or John Doe" and have the court issue a subpoena to gox for the information.  Serving the subpoena properly would be tricky, as I don't know whether gox has a physical presence in the U.S.  But, it's possible that once you got the subpoena, you could scan it to gox and that would be sufficient for their purposes, though not legally enforceable.
Not the easiest approach, but a possibility, if you are set on pursuing your own investigation.

Armory wallet is the safest online wallet you can use and is getting better with the upcoming update.  Listen to the recent Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast (last Thursday's) to get background.  
Armory provides both online and offline storage, with the best security IMO available among wallets.
I am not related or affiliated in any way to either Armory or LTB.

I always keep some fiat on the exchange in case of a big crash.  I usually have put and calls posted as well.  If there's a big jump up, I won't miss it and sell high.  If there's a big drop, I get out automatically at or just below where I bought.  Learned my lesson a few weeks ago when I didn't have those in place.  Of course, if it wasn't so volatile, it would be as much fun!

I don't know about you, but if I were a miner, I wouldn't want the shirt:
1.  why advertise I've got the hardware;
2.  why advertise that I've got BTC for the hacking;
3.  why flag myself for an audit;
4.  and why do all this with a t-shirt that doesn't support the currency?
Maybe folks who actually mine don't mind.  
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:21:55
Yeah, when we drop back to the year 2011, then it will be a good time to mine.  Otherwise, buy on dips and don't waste your assets on mining hardware.

Don't confuse asking price for buying price.  I doubt anyone is able to sell for more than 1 btc, at least to any buyer that  has any idea of what they're doing.  The ROI just isn't there.  You'd be lucky to mine a single BTC with a 5gh miner over its lifetime, then there's electricity cost. 
A couple weeks ago, I could have picked up a 30gh BFl single for just over 2 BTC plus shipping.  So, again, doubt a 5 would go for anywhere close to that at this time.

The risk of an emp event such as a large x class cme/solar flare is small, but the consequences are huge.  You'd be mad not to prepare.
The risk of global economic collapse is higher, with significantly huge consequences.
The chances that btc will become widely adopted are small but significant, with tremendous upside for early adopters.
There's lots of risk out there from all angles.  Prepare.  Hedge your bets. 
BTC is one great way to hedge, among many other benefits (e.g. taking power away from centralized authority), so it makes a lot of sense to get involved and support it.
But, don't neglect preparation in other areas as well.  And don't put all your eggs in one basket.

I can't entirely agree with that.  I've had a confirmed account for a couple months.  Successfully purchased coins, only to have most of my subsequent purchases (where I would have bought low) cancelled due to being a "high risk".  I've heard similar complaints from others.
Coinbase just isn't a reliable method for me atm.

So, you've sold the ranch and bought all you possibly could at $120 so you can make a mint on Monday?  You're that sure?

I feel the same as the OP.  For those of us who are just now beginning to obtain the technical knowledge to employ safety measures, btc is a scary place to store any wealth.
On the other hand, my "cash" in the bank or in my back pocket can be taken from me or disappear for any number of reasons and the same precautions I can take to protect my btc aren't available to protect my cash.
So, btc is worth pursuing.  Have many eggs in many baskets.
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:06:47
While it is theoretically possible for a change to be made, at this point "lost" BTC is gone forever.  We know that about 10% of current 12 million outstanding BTC are lost/seized or in wallets that haven't budged in years.  Assuming gone forever, it makes the remaining 90% more valuable.
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:55:22
Also, people shouldn't feel like they have to buy whole BTC.  If $230 is too much, then invest in 0.1 or 0.01.  The main point of the OP is sound.  We are the early adopters.  Should BTC go mainstream, the BTC community will grow exponentially quickly.  It's value will likely follow.
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:26:08
This has been posted before.  Using 20% off pitch to try to drum up sales.  And, yet, they also recently announced that they will not be making their promised November shipment on their next round of products.

I guess it depends on what you define as getting your feet wet.  I typically don't shell out hundreds of dollars on eBay just to check something out.  And, if you go back a few weeks ago (when the price was around $60), BTC lots of 5, 10 and 20 were up for auction.  Now, the lots are for .1, .01, and .001.

What's there to know?  You buy one on Amazon, plug it into your USB, choose a pool and start wasting electricity and keeping your USB port from being lonely.  You might generate some dust, but not enough to even be able to move out of the pool (from either device mentioned in the OP).

I had this problem early on.  My first couple purchases and sales went off without a hitch.  My next couple were cancelled.  I called.  They said they "whitelisted" me.  All purchases and sales since then went off fine, including a buy at $69 that settled in the 90s.

Everyone assumes btc and the currency used to purchase the mining equipment will remain at its current value level.  If I want to spend USD (which is likely to lose value over time) to buy mining equipment to mine btc (which is a deflationary currency and, by design, should increase in value over time), then it makes sense to mine.  You have to accept or bet on those two premises (USD inflationary; BTC deflationary).  But, if you do, it makes nothing but sense to change some USD into hardware and electricity in exchange for BTC.

They have to register in each state in which the operate.  For an online exchange of this nature, they would have to register in all 50 states (unless they limit users to certain states they are registered in).

Here's how btc works:
A.  Right after I buy, price goes down.
B.  Right after I sell, price goes way up.
So, just ask me when I plan to buy or sell and do the opposite.

Thanks for the tip.  In fact I don't have a tab open or a phone app.  I was driving back into town when I noticed a huge number of "authorization login failure" emails.  until I got those, I had forgotten I even had a blockchain.com wallet.  It's been months since I logged into it.  Even had to concentrate really hard to remember ID and PW.  Don't really care about the 0.002451 btc in the wallet.  Was mostly posting so that other folks were aware that it could happen to them at any moment.

Best thing we can do is stay home and not shop on "black" Friday and "Cyber" Monday.  Consumerism is destroying the planet.  Use BTC for necessities where/ when you can, but it's just supporting the dominant paradigm to co-opt their memes and simply layer BTC onto it.  
@_date: 2013-09-20 02:53:25
I agree and disagree.
If you understand bitcoin (i.e. that is deflationary) and want it to/believe it will succeed in the long term, then you absolutely should get into mining.  I wouldn't go hole hog or put my finances at risk, but I'd divert some discretionary income in that direction, for sure.  You become part of the infrastructure and you earn btc through mining and transaction fees.  The icing is long term deflation.
If you are only looking to make a short-term buck, move on.  That train left the station some time ago.

In my opinion, BFL is nothing but an agglomoration of unfair and deceptive trade practices.  You can't believe anything that comes out of their mouth.  I'm kind of disapointed in "let's talk bitcoin" for letting them off the hook during a recent interview w/ Josh.  Let the dude go on and on about their upcoming products when they can't even ship their foundational product or run a decent enterprise.
My hope is that they go out of business, which is likely since they have pissed off a far majority of the core early adopters in the BTC field.  
If anyone has BFL_Josh's contact info, I'd love to have it and send him a thank you for making me a cynic and complete skeptic towards any BTC startup.  I won't say they are single-handedly keeping BTC on the fringes, but they are doing their fair share through the sketchy and outright deceptive practices.
@_date: 2013-07-10 02:17:48
Because the supply of BTC is fixed (21 million) and some amount of BTC will be lost each and every day, BTC is considered deflationary.  It will increase in value over time (whether you value in $ or swiss cheese).
The nice thing about BTC is that it can be divided into smaller bits, up to, I believe, 8 decimal places at this point.
0.001 btc is 1 millibit. 0.000000 is called 1 microbit.
Because of this, it's likely that the increasing value of BTC over time would not make it unattractive, in itself.
