OTOH, if you sell something on ebay and the customer claims they didnt receive ..

Of course he is a liar, afterall, he is running a restaurant named "BitcoinRestaurant" that does not accept bitcoin.

If you can't withdraw, the physical delivery is a lie.

But still no crypto-&gt;fiat ATMs in japan?

You can run offline air gapped wallet only for signing on older general purpose hardware with no networking and then you don't need to trust the code :-o.

Skip the headaches? A year ago AAPL crashed 30%
buy appl 4 years ago and you are up about 100%, compare to btc ...

Yes, let's backup our private keys on samsung's servers. That's a really good idea ...
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:34:15
Or if you want real cold storage, setup a wallet (generate seed) on *offline* computer and only ever use xpub key on an online computer.
Note that ledger nor trezor is not as secure as an offline wallet.
@_date: 2019-02-26 17:39:07
Great, I offer beginners to send their private keys to me instead. Thus they have to trust only 1 person and not a bunch of samsung employees (and whoever is providing the service for samsung).
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:36:04
Or even read the whitepaper - it's nowhere as scary as it seems.
@_date: 2019-04-29 16:08:07
Kinda happens with right-wing people in the US, doesn't it?

ie. the whole "insurance" is a marketing scam ... who would have guessed !

Reading is obviously harder than math.
If they pull MtGox ... no one cares about hot or cold wallets..
Try harder shill.
@_date: 2019-04-04 18:02:56


If they pull MtGox ... you get about 1% back if you are lucky.
@_date: 2019-04-03 20:06:31




Insured up to what ... 1% of your holdings? yay!
@_date: 2019-04-03 16:22:35
I agree with this 100%. As much as I don’t like MtGoX they are probably the safest place to store coins from an exchange perspective.
@_date: 2019-04-03 20:07:45
Insurance and "legal framework"? So you get 1% back if your lucky? You are right, that's a little bit better than MtGox.
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:20:58
no nano?

Perhaps they use btc to buy? :P
