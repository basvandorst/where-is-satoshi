It's more of a stop-loss cascade.

Coinbase is a broker and thus has its own reservoir of coins. You "get" them instantly because they're simply allocating the coins to your account within their own system.
FYI, you can avoid the fees entirely by using their trading platform, GDAX.

The best investments are made when there's blood in the streets.

Hopefully you can get this sorted out. Please keep us updated.

Caught that falling knife.

I have a similar price target, but I've set up a few limit orders on the way down just in case it doesn't get that low.

Do you think Lightning Network is a good thing for *the price* of Bitcoin though? I mean, if people actually start using Bitcoin to pay for things, won't it cause selling pressure?
I think it's safe to assume that most retailers aren't interested in HODL'ing. They're going to take all of their Bitcoin payments and quickly liquidate them for fiat so they can pay their bills.
Am I missing something?

If Bitcoin's valuation was based on fundamentals, it'd be almost worthless (in terms of fiat), let's be real. Pure speculation has blown up this bubble and you're seeing much of that air deflate as we speak.

Uh-oh, you went against the orthodoxy! Heresy!

The order book.

It doesn't help that confirmations keep getting slower and fees keep rising.

Look at the order book and make your own call.

There's *massive* resistance at the $5990 to 6000 range. I seriously doubt the price will break past 6000 any time soon.
Edit: Looks like the dam broke!

I never compared it to wire transfers. Remittances are actually something Bitcoin does exceptionally well. 
The issue for me is that it sucks as a currency. Three dollars in fees and 30 minutes of waiting isn't acceptable as a day-to-day means of exchange. Hopefully these scaling problems can be resolved eventually, the sooner the better. 
All of the really cool revolutionary shit we were pumped about, like bringing the unbanked masses into the world economy and replacing fiat - which aren't feasible with Bitcoin in its current state - have seemingly been tossed to the wayside by apologists.
I believe Bitcoin can be the future, as I'm sure most of you do, but let's not pretend that everything is hunky-dory.
