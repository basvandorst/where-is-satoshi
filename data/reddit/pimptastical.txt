Pretty sure you don't get it.  So let me break it down reaaaaaly simply.
Scenario 
- Run 3 BFL's at separate locales.  Say they each consume $5 per month of electricity.  I'm only on the hook for one of the BFL's consumption.  My hard cost is $5/month.
Scenario 
- Run 1 Larger BFL at my house.  Say it consumes $15 per month of electricity.  I'm on the hook for the total $15.  My hard cost is $15/month.
Like I said, it was just an idea.  Wanted to float the idea to the community to see if it was a good one or foolish.

Wow.  How far do I have to break this down for you to get it?
They completely understand.  They are totally fine absorbing the cost for me.  My point is I don't want to take advantage of any one of their generosity by saddling any of them with some huge hit to their power bill by running multiple machines at any one locale.  I have a few people nice enough to help me with an experiment, that they are completely clear on the circumstances on.
But, the FTL's (real or not) can't run headless so it's pretty much moot at this point anyways.

Understandable question.  The way I sold it is that if say three people agree to "host" my BFL appliance at a negligible impact to their electricity bill, and at that they are ok with it.  The more I host at one locale, the less negligible it gets, the less ok they are with it.
Although probably not ideal to have them at different locations, it would be the cheapest way to contain the "overhead".  But, it wouldn't work if I need a dedicated computer for each at each locale.
Maybe it's all just a bad idea, but like I said, just an idea.
