Look at the Cryptomatic website to see all the detailed images of this watch. This photo really doesn't do it justice!
 I bought it in 2014 when Bitcoin was around 200 dollars per coin. Been hodling it ever since. I could have gotten 002 of 200 - but chose 007 as I'm British and a big Bond fan!
All of these watches sold out fast... way before Bitcoin gained popularity. I'm just curious now to see if anyone else who is massively into Bitcoin would be proud to wear a watch like this? ����

Fair enough. All depends on what you perceive the value of an item to be. This watch is from a limited production run. Nothing else like it exists, and it's from an era when Bitcoin was still very much undervalued. Those who were invested in Bitcoin 3 years ago, and have since seen their investments rise by 10x or more - would be proud of having ridden all the ups and downs along the way. This watch is a strong reminder of your commitment to Bitcoin having paid off. It is for me anyway, and each of the other owners. This watch means more to those who own one than any Rolex ever could. As such, to me it's priceless. If it got lost, i could never replace it. But maybe I'm just to sentimental about it. ��

Not according to several specialist watch makers I've shown it too. They are very impressed with the materials used and the craftsmanship. This is no knock-off rolex! May not hold as much kudos as a real Rolex, but it means a lot to me as I got it at the start of my Bitcoin journey... before most people on here even knew what Bitcoin was! ��

About 1.4btc at the time - which was around 800 dollars. To me it didn't seem expensive at all as I had a lot of Bitcoin accumulated back then... and I was a massive advocate for Bitcoin. I'm now involved in Blockchain consulting, and this watch is always a great talking point in the wider blockchain community. So even though it's worth over 8000 dollars in today's conversion rate - it's still priceless to me.

Very fair comments,
Thank you kindly for your contribution here. It's definitely not to everyone's taste. I've never noticed anything wrong with the movement, but I can see why the makers cut a few corners. Back then they were taking a big leap to accept Bitcoin. Not long after I bought this watch, the value of Bitcoin dropped almost 50% over the space of a few months. 
No one knew the price would skyrocket to over $5000 dollars back then. I feel if they were to remake these today, they would put a lot more effort into using only the best quality parts.
It's got it's flaws no doubt - but for the owners who managed to get one early on - it really does represent a major achievement and it's one way we can prove we were there in the early days when the death bells for Bitcoin were ringing after the Mt Gox scandal. 
I wouldn't swap it for any Rolex in existence. That's how much it means to me. 
And I'm sure you will find plenty of other watches that cost over $1000, are worse looking, and with lower quality components... same way you can buy a painting for $2m that looks like a 2 year old had some fun with a paint brush... someone will still pay $2m for that canvas just simply because it has a story behind it that means something to them. Or they are more likely laundering money - but who are we to question? ��

Perhaps not - but the company who sold the watches in the early days would certainly have seen a massive increase in their profits if they held into those Bitcoins. 
As I paid 1.4btc for the watch, that is what it's worth. I didn't pay for it in dollars. You can only buy these with Bitcoin.

Depends on whether you are pricing it in dollars or Bitcoin. It's a Bitcoin watch, worth 1.4btc when I bought it. So say you bought it for £20, when £20 was worth $30. 5 years later £20 is worth $1000 (theoretically)... the watch is still worth £20 as a minimum. That's not accounting for the fact it's a rare limited edition, that you can't buy any more if you wanted one. You wouldn't say the watch is worth £2 because the purchasing power of the dollar has decreased.
