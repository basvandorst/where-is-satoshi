there are 8 numbers in 00212121, 8 is a factor of 24, each number might represent 3 words and will guide you on finding the order of the passphrase [maybe ;)]

Don't waste your energy on anything until you figure out why the 7 in 257 [not in the whitepaper] and the L from lost right next to it is crossed out.
It's not random
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:05:48
Yeah, why do we need to get rid of 7 and l [the notdef looks carefully and deliberately placed just on the L rather than the whole word] 
There are a few other words with the letters ost in the whitepaper that are also passphrase words

Why would it be a BIP39 and not the private key?
severely limiting in the way you could recover it
Isn't the white paper about private/public key cryptography?
why would the solution be a BIP39 key...?

oh, thanks
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:58:42
I think it will help us order the seed words
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:48:00
the seeds words are ALMOST costs and users, so they're cost and use respectively =^) idk lmao

Put your mnemonic words into iancoleman.io/bip39/ and select bip49 on the bottom, if the prize btc address shows up, put those same words into a bitcoin wallet and the btc will be yours

theyre from the bitcoin whitepaper
@_date: 2018-05-22 16:49:25
highly doubtful, even the creator has realized how convoluted and unsolvable it was that they moved the original bitcoin to a different address to remove a suspected password ON TOP of the seed. And this was AFTER they already gave multiple clues. :o

I think after all these years it had to have been found a long time ago, and probably by accident whoever found it; they probably didn't know about Fenn or anything, and kept hush hush about it because you don't want someone else claiming the gold you found in the woods.
But thinking further I'm sure he'd put a pamphlet of info in the chest or something so..... idk..... lmao

why is 7 from 257 [not in the whitepaper] and the L from lost crossed out??
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:20:51
not even, its [7][2][5]
not even in reverse or unfortunately, and those are citations, don't know what to do with the citations or how the 2 and 5, or 7 is related to lost with l crossed out
or maybe the 7 and l are infact selected, and they're the key, not whats uncrossed
@_date: 2018-05-31 11:55:37
has to do with the address starting with a 3
@_date: 2018-05-25 14:06:14
yes they will, transaction fees
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:57:49
you don't think it's odd there are 8 numbers there, which could perfectly factor into 24? The number of seed words? each number could represent a group of 3 words each
