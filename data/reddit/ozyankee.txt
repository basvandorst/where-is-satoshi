Any expert in a financial market cannot make such bold statements with any certainty.  They can only speculate or backup the POSSIBILITY of a price drop/gain with technical analysis or other research.  If proffesor Bitcorn was as smart as that, he would have bought as much BTC as he could when it was $13/btc and sold when it hit $1000.

So why are you called "ScryptRigs", shouldn't you be "SHA256Rigs"? :)

One thing I learned in trading is that there is no harm in settling for just under your target.  $990 would have been perfectly acceptable to take profit on instead of standing firm on $1000.  You could have then used that $990 to buy almost 2btc now and sit on it.
Next time, take the profit and don't be so stubborn :)

Nice title to this, do you work for FOX news?  The title should be Trading disabled on Mt. Gox.
That's all that's "happening".  Gotta love speculation....

I did the same thing, trying to cancel the wire and get the money back.  I knew it was a gamble but with the info I had about Gox it was tottering on the fence ready to fall one way or the other.  With the info I have now, it's inches from crashing down into the "doomed" side.
I called my bank to reverse the wire, they said it's not guaranteed I'll get the money back and the other bank or receiver can refuse to reverse the transaction.
