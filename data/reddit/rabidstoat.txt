Still not quite following, is the problem that OP only had little bits of money in bitcoin, and they couldn't be combined on his side and sent as one transaction, they had to be sent as individual transactions? Or in other words, if it costs a certain amount per transaction, why would someone use 64 transactions instead of one, what's forcing them to do that?

[Well, there's a general thread in their related subreddit.](

Just add blockchains to existing dating platforms. Done!

Not OP but I invested $150 (in BTC, LTE, &amp; ETH) when BTC was at about $3500. That is a tiny fraction of my investments at this stage in my life, more akin to gambling. I just like watching the numbers change so fast.
Got my $150 up to nearly $1000 when it was at ATH. Now it's back to $650. Even if it goes to $0, oh well.
Of course, when it was up like 800% I was like, why didn't I invest $150,000 instead of $150????

And held the whole time? Did you lose the key to your wallet for a while?

You can buy fractions. I own 0.015 bitcoin (that I bought at like $3500). So a little over 1% of a bitcoin.

Well, shit, looks right to me. *shrug*

True Bitcoin Cash.

I'm really confused. I don't follow bitcoin much but the articles I've been reading talk about BTC and BCC. In those articles, they seemed to mean BCC as Bitcoin Cash, or the forked Bitcoin alternative.
But is the issue that BCC is actually used by Bitconnect Coin or some such which, I guess, is another altcoin cryptocurrency and reported by some markets? And now it's really start to cause confusion with actual mining so people are trying to move toward an unused acronym in cryptocurrency which might be BCH? Though I saw another user say BMC (bitmain coin)....

Wait, bitcoincash.org says that the recommended ticker symbol is BCC, right on their main page.
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:11:19
Wait, so it's not that BTC is holding steady and the USD is rising against it???

Hi, I'm from the future. The next bull run for BTC will start October 17, 2018 and will last (with a few intermittent smaller dips) through May 2, 2019.

7200 what?
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:53:59
I personally wouldn't buy until it hit $3751.73.

I invested 0.1% of my annual post-tax income just to watch the numbers go up and down.

I liquidated my 401k and bought in at 20k, when it hits 50k I'll have more than doubled my money!

Bookmarked to check out later, thanks!
**Edited to add:** Watched a bit of it and definitely like this guy as a presenter. Will check back on bitcoin in 2-5 years to see if it's more stable. And I did appreciate this bit from the presenter in the video: "What is the endgame of bitcoin? I believe the expression is 'to the moon.'" Heh. Appreciate the deadpan. I only check in periodically on this forum but enough to know that's spot on! ;)

That's what I would consider speculation. Well, 80% speculation.
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:54:09
Is price (as a longer term trend, not shorter term fluctuations) thought to be correlated to adoption, or independent of it?
I mean, it does seem like it could be useful in places where there are barriers to electronic banking and the like. Though I'm not sure how the microtransaction nature of it runs nowadays. Most of what I hear about it being used for is drugs and speculation, but it's hard for me to discern how much of that is reality and how much of it just a side effect of where I get my information.

No, don't be silly, he was just staring at the chart to pass the time while waiting for his 9-year-old to come downstairs with sound investment advice.

Bitcoin is interesting but I'll never invest while the volatility is so high. I would become a nervous wreck at every jump and dip and become obsessed either worrying about a crash, or being giddy over gains. Just not worth it for me, too much anxiety for my investment portfolio.
