Yeah, but that's assuming they don't have other shit to do, like work, over the next 11 hours.

I still don't get it. Telegram doesn't have a QR scanner and that's not the telegram app he's using in the video.

Isn't HodlHodl kind of an ironic name for an exchange?

Wait, she was arrested for carrying a bitcoin cold wallet? What was she charged with?

Unlike the glorious ruble which has never been used for anything illegal.

Thanks, this is exactly what I was after. I love node and this seems like just the right place to start.

A surprisingly positive explanation of Bitcoin from the Guardian. I like their emphasis on cutting out financial middle-men. But I'm not exactly sure who the people claiming Bitcoin will destroy the economy are. And I don't think it really gives a balanced view of why Bitcoin is more trust worthy than banks. I guess they were struggling to provide both a pro- and anti-Bitcoin perspective in order to seem impartial.

How would it determine what size he needed the product in?

Might be waiting a while for that...

Weird, according to [this site]( they somehow identified him through his gmail account:

First time I've looked into bitcoin betting. It seems to work really, and is actually quite addictive. I placed a few bets on the price of bitcoin on there.
I also betted Scotland will go independent, because I'm a schmuck.

I doubt the NSA will outright admit that their surveillance program is the source of the leak. If it was any other source it would be fairly trivial for the NSA to find the culprit.

This is great. Exactly what I need to get started, thanks!

Wow, that's pretty stupid. He's fucked.

I strongly recommend using github if you want to get others involved in your project.
At the moment you've explained your idea, but it's not a new idea. Lots of people have tried to tackle how to make purchasing bitcoin easier, but very few people succeed. If you have a credible idea then you need to demonstrate it before people are going to be willing to sacrifice time to helping you with it.
Also read up on node. There a lot of really good packages available through npm that already handle 80% of what you want to code, so you can focus all your attention on that final 20%.

Please mobile optimise your site. The icons above your nav bar are horribly stretched on narrow screens.

Is there a write up on the distribution of bitcoin I can read somewhere?
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:18:32
No, I'm not from the US so I don't really pay much attention to how the legal system works there.

Probably a stupid question but who is Richard Page? Silk Road is registered in their name. I'm pretty sure you'd find a way to use a fake name if you're registering silk road, but it's still interesting.

Bittylicious is reasonably quick but limits your purchases and has high fees.

Put your wallet on a USB and lock it in a drawer if you're worried about the security of your computer.

No wonder they have so many grievances if they're having to resort to eating their clothes.

Alex Winter of Bill &amp; Ted fame is in the process of making a [documentary about Silk Road](
His previous documentary "Downloaded" was about Napster, and was really good.

Looking at that bitcoin/yuan graph I have to say that the relationship isn't particularly pronounced.
@_date: 2018-10-26 14:39:33


Incredible. You've completely missed my point and proven it at the same time.

Does anybody else here absolutely cringe when someone attacks someone as a "statist"? 
It's like that kid in school who thought they were edgy because they called people posers.

But surely if he's touched those bitcoin then it would be visible for everybody to see on the blockchain? Where did the exchange store its funds?

Appropriate username.

Does this make a value of $1 million the definition of "moon" then?

I'm surprised this isn't the most obvious thing. Get her a simple phone wallet, ask for $10 then send the bitcoin to her wallet. From the sounds of it she just wants to get a feeling for how it works. By overcomplicating it you're sending the complete wrong message.
Sure, if digitally illiterate people want to hold their life savings in bitcoin then we've got a problem, but people who want to make that kind of commitment will also want to make sure they understand at least a little about how to make it secure.

Why's that? What's wrong with Santi?
@_date: 2015-03-15 11:41:03
From what I remember this documentary conveniently concludes with bitcoin valued at 1000 dollars. The obvious first question will be how much is it worth now.
I didn't really feel like the documentary achieved anything worthwhile after watching it. It's enthusiastic sure, but it didn't provide any interesting content. It was just bitcoin enthusiasts being enthusiastic over the price rise and ranting a little fanatically. I don't think it ever did a good job of providing a coherent argument to convince sceptics.

How come I can't find this project on github? How can I get involved?

I imagine if you find yourself in a position where you are being tortured you're going to have bigger concerns than the security of your wallet seed.

Any thoughts on why the volume is seemingly high on Basel? I live in a UK city with a similar population size, but I can't imagine there'd be anywhere near that volume of trade if I set up a bitcoin ATM here.

Sounds cool, I'll take a look for them on coinmap. What else do they sell?

Can anyone ELI5 what happens when all the bitcoins have been mined? What changes? Why is the limit set to 21 million and not 42 million?

That's such a horrendous simplification of a very serious situation. It's not just about Greece's spending it's about the nature of the loans they were issued too.

Not an answer to the question but somebody needs to build a search engine that specifically indexes bitcoin stores.
