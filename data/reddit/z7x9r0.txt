Hodl, if you dont need the $$$. It'll stay steady between $700 - $850 then raise again above $1500 in the next 1 - 4 months. At that time we'll get another bull run and drop to $900. Been happening in small sizes all year.. (I dont have a crystal ball, but I wish I did. I bought when BTC was $815 and I plan to hodl. There's too much going on this year to not effect it jumping back up again like it did this week IMHO)

I think we'll stabilize around $700 - $850 and in 1 - 4 months jump back to $1500 and dip down to $900 that same week. Seeing it happen all year in smaller sizes. I have no crystal ball so who knows. Bought at $815 and will hodl for the long run

It's sad, but is true. HODL

This is going to be BIG if major news sources cover it actually going over gold, and talking about it all day everyday because of views.

We need more of it.
Each type of media, be it community or corporate based, has it's own amount of influence.
The more light the better I believe

We're talking about the start of 2017, right?

Any news on recent activity for the Bitcoin ETF to be approved? I feel it's inevitable

Some have been saying the crash is coming, but it seems like it's been buffered to happen later in time (like years). Do we have an idea of who will start crashing first?
China and then India are my first two guesses.
Some are talking about Trump having an effect, but I doubt that has any impact until action, rules, and laws are taking place. Otherwise it feels like gossip without any facts

win win

Any news on recent activity for the Bitcoin ETF to be approved? I feel it's inevitable, but have yet to see recent updates on it be approved
