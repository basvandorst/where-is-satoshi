Let me chime in with a little more tact :)
Microsoft wasn't actually "accepting" Bitcoin but merely converting it immediately to fiat anyways during the sale. Microsoft doesn't hold Bitcoin so this doesn't equate to a sell-off of any kind. This isn't a coin liquidation - nothing to impact the price in that regard.
More importantly, people don't buy Bitcoin so they can shop at Microsoft. A few folks may have, but if any sales were happening, the user most likely already held BTC by their own choice - not just because Microsoft started accepting it as payment. 
If anyone did hold BTC strictly because of Microsoft, well, you now see how few because the price hasn't changed. That's how few people really cared about Microsoft's involvement.
The only time Bitcoin's price fluctuates is when users buy or sell it directly. Before Microsoft was Steam. Before Steam was Overstock.com and TigerDirect.com. Many tech stores have started and stopped accepting BTC but the price keeps going up over the years. And I actually think you can still use Bitcoin at TigerDirect sooo. . . that kind of negates Microsoft anyways. You can still buy a SurfacePro or a copy of Windows10 with BTC. . .

Sure, now that btc is almost $20k it's easy to say this but back when it was under $500, if you had bills to pay and only owned a few coins, I'm not surprised if you sold out completely hoping to buy back in later....

It's important because the situation caused many bitcoin holders to switch to bcash. Calling themselves the real bitcoin. Now we can see it was just another ICO like the rest.

You raise a good point. . . We're all assuming the shorters will just have some magical abundance of traders going long. Why would I use the futures market to go long? I can just buy directly on the exchange now and hold. 
So does this mean, in the sense of supply and demand for short-long positions, there might be a lack of long positions? Thus a lack of short positions even available to contract? Would this somehow hit the futures market in a way that creates scarcity in being able to take a short position?
I'm new to this whole futures market stuff but have been learning as much as possible since the announcement to protect my investments. . .

Bank runs have happened. . .
And if anything you do ever turns out to be criminal, your accounts can be legally seized, whether you agree to it or not.
But my point isn't about banks VS crypto. I'm just clarifying that the product of this escrow chaos doesn't matter. It could be Beanie Babies that triggered a charge-back. It's not a fault of crypto.
This is about a bad actor, a single company, who's actions were triggered by 2 users using the least secure method of escrow. Had OP used e-Transfer and not released his coins until he saw the balance in his banking app, none of this would/could have happened. Again, nothing to do with crypto, everything to do with a single company handling a situation badly.
If we ever do get decentralized escrows whose only payment option is e-Transfer, this should be nothing but a thing of the past. I'm just trying to keep the focus that it's an Escrow Service at fault here, not the product being traded (crypto)

Hang on, you're kinda losing the point here. . .
Paypal CAN freeze your account just like LBC froze this guy's account. E-Bay's escrow service has the same checks-and-balances for charge backs and sometimes they also end up in a bit of chaos and delay.
However, OP wouldn't even have a problem if a USER hadn't scammed him. We don't blame e-Bay directly when a user gets scammed and initially LBC didn't do anything wrong.
Now, the delays since? Yep, as a company trying to be professional, I can't defend them or these actions. Not at all. But that's a company being unprofessional on a business level. It's not like LBC set up a predatory account to slowly become one of the most trusted users on their own site, then to flip the coin and start scamming everyone.
Ultimately, if you just pair escrow with e-Transfer, there's ZERO room for scamming (why everyone doesn't just use e-Transfer is beyond me). The crypto sits in escrow. The cash is sent out of users bank account with no option to reverse. Crypto seller confirms the money made it INTO their own bank account and notifies escrow service. Escrow releases crypto and there is ZERO room for scamming.
Remember, this has nothing to do with crypto and everything to do with an escrow service. If the only service was to conduct trades without the chargeback option, there would be no room for scamming.

I've got to admit, gold doesn't work when the power goes out anymore.
No way to find it's current value. No way to precisely divide it into pieces for trade that I can measure against the value I don't know. No way to carry around more than 50lbs worth if there's no power anymore (remember, gas pumps won't work without power so no more motors). And then the real caveat, hardly anybody holds any quantity of gold anymore to use for trade. 
We would probably all just use our current paper money, whatever isn't locked up in an ATM.
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:12:52
Actually a gov't couldn't do a 51% attack. They would need massive amounts of asic power to overtake those already with asics... and the hardware doesn't physically exist. It's already owned. They would need to finance their own asics, which wouldn't pass any 1st world country's budget in the first place.
And the gov't couldn't ddos without using tax payer money. Banks could try though, they control a method for purchasing btc through wire transfers, but again they would have to publicly disclose to share holders and their Boards where all that money went...
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:06:47
No. 
This has nothing to do with crypto and everything to do with an Escrow Service that allows a payment method which includes a charge-back option. Local Bitcoins isn't a scam site. That particular payment method is a scammy way to trade crypto and a USER scammed OP. Happens on e-Bay too.
I've been a trusted buyer/seller on LBC for almost 4 years now. I ONLY use the e-Transfer payment option and everyone else should only too. It's not like you can receive a defective product. BTC will always be "pristine". There's no reason to need a charge-back if the escrow service is functional. It's not like buying something on e-Bay and it looks nothing like the pictures or came damaged.
If people only used escrow services for crypto that had no charge-back option, there would be no scams on these services.

I've kept about 90% of them stored and invested the rest in other alt coins like Doge. McDonalds might be the biggest but Wendy's still rakes in the profit too. I believe alts can still profit and grow along side BTC, just like every other industry. It's just a matter of the community building utility into the currency. That's the investment risk we're all taking right now - which coins will succeed in building global utility / adoption. 
Anyways, good luck with your own investments :)
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:14:53
Perhaps. It would cost billions of dollars to manufacture enough asics to overtake the ones already built and running. And the cost of implementation and then maintenance. All those staff physically checking those asics and you've got to pay them enough to keep their mouths shut while they carry out the 51% attack, another single Snowden would destroy the NSA - especially to international gov'ts in bed with the US.
The truth is, I can see the gov't actually turning to btc to save itself. They're hostage to the federal reserve. They have been for decades. Even if the gov't wanted to help people, they can't, because the very financial system that pays for freedoms has indebted the people. What has the 2008 meltdown cost every US tax payer again? And what did you even get as a citizen out of it? All that debt and taxes you're obligated to pay now and for what? 
If the gov't embraces and legitimizes btc and ties a master wallet address to each SIN # like they already do with our jobs and taxes, nobody will be able to run a black market. They will once and for all have a total view of their citizen's money. It's a very good benefit to a gov't if they can use the blockchain to audit their finclances. Who can comlain now about shady deals when the possibility of fully trackable money negates most of that. If we actually get to a world of only digital currency, it'll be harder to hide financial fraud than it currently is with physical money and counterfit etc.
The curious part is for those of us who already have cryptos in wallets not tied to identifiers... technically, we all have black market money :) If the gov't legitimizes bultc but makes us all register, well a bunch of us have untrackable currency already... which I actually think makes it worth more... to me at least from this perspective...

? 2 million custom asics isn't a small order when the whole operation would have to be covert. And if it was that easy to manufacture asics I'm sure a single US company would have tried (bfl never made it to market...)




Other coins. Today it's not about shutting down btc anymore. You have to shut down all cryptos. Dogecoin is already growing a larger user base than btc and there are 300+ other coins the public could turn to. Maybe in 2009 when there were 5 different coins this was possible but it's a very different network today.




? The hardware isn't the problem, it's the mining itself. Each asic blade has its own miner setup and translates to a console screen that has to be monitored. And this is custom hardware / software with very little support available. I don't know if you've ever mined before but the system is not stable. I might be lucky if one of my miners stays up for 4 - 5 days before needing to tweek something in bfgminer. Sure, the gov't could write their own software too, just more costs and more people that have to keep quiet. 
And large data centres have full staff working around the clock. I used to work with Bluehost so I'm speaking from experience. And they're not using custom software / hardware. When an HP Procurve goes down you can just call HP. What about when an asic goes down? Again, more costs...




Add materials to manufacture. Then the cost of catching up to the newest 300 gh/s asics. Then the multiple years to overtake all crypros... yes, we're easily in the billions.




Avalon had cheap Chinese labor. Just the employee salaries in the US would destroy the project's operating costs. This is fairly understood which is why almost all our electroincs are produced.... by cheap Chinese labor. Perhaps Russia or China could pull this off... but financially and technologically we're at a point where it will really cost a nation to try. And they have to maintain their systems forever then lest another coin pop up... I just don't see allocating this much tax payer money as a minor cost the public won't question.

Does Vault of Satoshi have any merchant services? I hear good stuff about their exchange and purchasing btc...
@_date: 2014-03-30 11:50:24
Your costs are accurate if you already have the factory, materials and workers... like China, but the US doesn't yet. That's why getting asics has been so lucrative. There are some pretty heavy start-up costs involved just to catch up (and employee costs would definitely run higher here than in China... thus I'd be hard pressed to believe the same asics could he produxed as cheaply).
And you're not factoring in all the cloud hashing already running right now either... and growing.
Let's say the gov't actually spent the $750 million just to reproduce the current hashrate. Those 500,000 asics need to be monitored too. Even if 1 employee could look after 500 units, which would be incredulous, at $200k a year that's 1000 people costing an extra $200 million (I believe Snowden was making this with the NSA?)... 
I mean, at this point, without even buying supplies or a factory, we're at almost $1 billion... and that's just to catch up to today's hashrate...add in what KnC are currently manufacturing + other competitors and costs go up even further.
I'm not saying it's impossible. But considering the costs and benefits btc potentially provides the gov't, I'm saying it's improbable they would do this.
Just my 2 cents, thanks for the debate :)

Not trying to be a jerk! Just. . . yet again folks, NEVER rely on ANY exchange to be your long-term wallet!! Part of the whole point of having crypto is to have total control over it. Which means having it in your own possession!

Yeah btc isn't hard to get. Banning it doesn't make it hard to get at all. Banning it just makes the btc you hold useless in your home country. 
It's like banning email, suddenly you can't send emails in your home country but you've got all these credits to send thousands of emails just sitting on your phone. You can't actually ban btc. You can only stop people from using it on legit purchases that get taxed. The infrastructure is done so nobody can stop folks from actually holdikg btc if they want. Yoir gov't can just make it useless in your home country. It doesn't actually become scarce like a physical product.

There are all kinds of darkcoin/anon coins you can tumble your money through. It's not hard to make it impossible to link the $650 of crypto you bought in 2012 to any of your current money. Here's how:
1). Connect with any exchange legally. Do all that visibility/identity crap they make you jump through so you can transact without major restrictions. 
2). At any point you see fit, send your coins from the exchange to a tumbling service/darkcoin option. 
3). From this service/darkcoin, send back to your actual wallet (on desktop or mobile). This will "disconnect" the trail between the exchange wallet and your final wallet.
4). Profit.
If you really want this to not be linked to you, only ever log in to the exchange from a free-to-access public computer OR (better still) a stand-alone laptop with TAILS and all that other encryption goodness. 
I'm not advocating to commit tax evasion btw. I'm just laughing that the IRS thinks they can possibly enforce themselves on this with their current tech. 
Currently, if a seller is willing to sell me their house for BTC, an anonymous stranger can totally sweep in and pay off that bill for me with their BTC. And the wallet this BTC came from would never be linked to me. Currently.

Bitcoin is the brand name of a technology. With the upcoming Lightning Network, you won't even notice crypto being swapped to accomplish the exchange you seek. It doesn't matter which coin you use. They all use the same blockchain technology.
Don't get caught up in the brand naming. Start looking at the technologies behind it. I was pretty clear about those: lower fees and more liquid than our current system. With you in full control of your own money.

No other currency is called Canadian dollars. The unique part of that title is the word Canadian. Anyone else can use the word dollars, it's not brand-specific. But Canadian dollars are a specific thing and when you try to buy them, you expect a certain thing.
The word cash is just like the word dollars, anyone can use it. But the word Bitcoin is very much a specific and unique title.
I'm not just calling out bcash for misappropriating the name. I think it sucks that all the other BitcoinXYZ coins also try to ride the "bitcoin" branding.

Bitcoin is just the gateway drug. Once you have some, you can trade it for Doge and other coins. 
The cost for this exchange is typically 0.1% so on $10 for example you would pay 10 cents just to flip the Bitcoin into a faster, cheaper coin. Then it costs 1 Doge to spend Dogecoin - which is 0.001368 cents. So about every 7 purchases combined would rack up about 1 cent in tx fees.
Total cost: 11 cents to pull out $10 and spend parts of it up to 7 times. 
Now if you went to an ATM. . . 
- Can you even withdraw $10?
- Was it your banks ATM or did you get stuck with that $2-$3 dollar withdraw fee?
- Now that you've taken the money out, can you put back and protect what you haven't spent?
- Can you get mugged? etc, etc, etc
Using debit: 
- Prone to card skimming
- Using the banks money (which can be seized / frozen on you against your will)
- If card gets lost/stolen must go to a bank to get access to money again
- Possibly a monthly fee just to have an account
- Only insured up to a certain $$ value anyways, etc, etc, etc. . . 
Bitcoin is just the gateway drug. . .

At the moment, people are better off LEARNING what their private key is. Bitcoin isn't easy to get into yet. People don't just accidentally have bitcoin. If you took the hour or 2 to figure out how to buy BTC, plus did the KYC all exchanges are asking for now, then you should take the 8 minutes to watch a YouTube video about using your OWN wallet.
This is like asking a stranger to hold your house keys for you because the lock is just too confusing. Ignorance and hoping others will protect you is not the answer. Learn.

The main purpose of bitcoin though isn't all the shady stuff you're eluding to in your post. Traceless, decentralized, feeless. None of this is the point of bitcoin. We already have this with paper money.
The point of bitcoin is that NOBODY can individually alter the minting/supply of the coin.  No gov't or corporation can suddenly print their own, in whatever quantity they feel like. The blockchain being public and anyone being able to setup a node ensures that - we can all participate in the audit.

Thank you for that explanation! I didn't realize who was behind the fork or the impact! You guys have at least 1 more supporter now.

Hmmm, I really only download apps from the Play store.
Oh well.
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:40:36
Can't seem to find an app called changelly in the app store?
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:47:45
Oh!! Not yet but thanks for sharing! I'll keep my eyes peeled first thing tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:25:22
Does this mean a whale (like a bank) can intentionallly lose money to keep the BTC futures price down? Sorry, I'm kinda of a noob to the market side of things infiltrating bitcoin these days....

WPA2 has been compromised. No thanks.

A conference call?? People here sound like they hope Amazon will announce BTC integration but... seriously, via a conference call? I highly doubt that.
This is the kind of thing Amazon would want serious fanfare behind. I mean, we're literally talking about integrating a completely new payment tech.
Not trying to be negative, just straight-up...

Sorry, it's just you have 3 or 4 options really. All fairly easy to follow but just probably easier to understand in a quick 8 min video.
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:08:42
There are some really good Youtube videos coming out about this right now with answers to your questions. I was in your shoes about 3 hours ago and now I'm all caught up :)

So a bunch of guys who accomplished the impossible, 50 years ago, are putting down a guy today accomplishing the impossible? ....
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:31:40
Thank you! Looking forward to a Shapeshift alternative. I've had mixed experiences with their service...
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:20:32
I want to understand the topic better. Why are you against 2X? I haven't paid much attention these last few months but I am now!
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:31:17
I only regret the coins I didn't buy today....

Put your 1/2 into BTC now! Give her hers... in 1 year her money will be worth less while you hopefully profit :)
Unless you "spend" all the money on a piece of art and claim that's where all the money went, a judge can just subpoena your accounts and see the momey move. Aka, you'll get screwed over.... 
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:51:33
Is this what we're doing again? Bragging with the "I bought a whole BTC and here's my wholesome excuse for anmouncing it" thing? Didn't that die off in Nov-Dec?
Dad with multiple investments, also buys some BTC. Also, water is wet...

Happens all the time. I've done so when visiting Cuba a few years ago. I just trusted the Hotel Front Desk to exchange properly for me.
@_date: 2016-10-15 00:32:17
Exactly. That's the one worth more and it was new at the time
@_date: 2016-10-14 22:03:35
I bought a package online with my Visa. All inclusive. The flight, hotel, food and drinks were all included. Sunwing has a setup with their hotels for free buses from the airport when you arrive too. It's all part of the package and they take you back to the airport from the hotel at the end of your stay too. 
It's just up to you to have spending money for once you get to the hotel and want to leave and start exploring. So I just figured I'd exchange money while checking into my room. It worked out fine. Turns out Cuba has 2 concurrent currencies and one's worth waaaaay more than the other. I had no clue until the clerk at the hotel told me.

So when Western Union demands to see my ID before giving me my money,  that's a problem with the fiat, not Western Union's business??
Dumb Fuck :) I want to do business with you and rip you off so you blame fiat currency hahahaha I'll never get charged with YOUR logic :D Hey everyone jump on board! This guy won't sue you,  he'll blame the currency instead! &lt;3
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:07:06
Good luck! And hold your own coins in the future :)
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:47:23
You don't need any of that to just transfer your btc into your phone wallet or what have you... 
Leaving that kind of sizable amount of btc anywhere outside your reach is a bad choice. Very bad choice. Didn't you see what happened to folks this time last year on MtGox? Is $40k US not motive enough to protect that investment personally?
Never leave money on an exchange to just sit there. 
Otherwise, get ready for their rules and requests. Not much to see here. If someone accessed my own account and tried draining it, I'd be glad Cryptsy is doing all that they're doing to you. Sorry but anyone who's been scammed out of btc is happy Cryptsy has the protections in place they do. 
Don't want to play by those rules?  Hold the coins yourself :p
@_date: 2016-07-26 19:37:25
Your BTC clock is kinda cool! I hope the site picks up and we see more cool creative stuff like that :)

You make $15k net selling sunglasses online? Please. . . teach me. . . Or tell me how you go into e-commerce like that? That's practically my dream to get into web commerce like that. . .

+1 Cryptsy all the way. Sure, things get overloaded there sometimes but their customer service and ticketing system is pretty good. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:00:02
 
Quick. Lots of other altcoins to trade too. None of this "delay" people are talking about with BTC-e either.
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:08:11
Couldn't agree more. Folks need to consider the advantages alts provide as that extra step of anonymity in the transaction chain. 
There's a lot of dirty money out there too and alts make a great hiding place now that banks are getting raided and investigated more and more... just sayin' incase any fund managers are reading and need to wash some fiat ;) 
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:44:53
Or you can wash those btc through multiple altcoins, convert back to btc (it isn't the original btc you bought so it breaks the blockchain tracking) and finally convert back to cash to deposit and spend at will - unlinked to your original dollar bills :)
Btc is just the first step... If you're into washing fiat and whatnot...
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:27:55
Really? Just tried myself and got the insufficient funds message. No mistaken transfers over here...

I've had this same issue when canceling orders... Hit cancel, order disappears, balance doesn't go back to my account right away though so I'm stuck waiting around for the update before I can trade again... I've written their support too and it just sounds like growing pains. They've always sorted it out for me but yes, frustrating at times when you see a good opportunity and the site is lagging on updates like that. 
Good luck
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:55:45
See that's why I'm so confused about this - I've gone onto the blockchain site and my wallet says the funds are still there. It's like the wallet app on my phone never even broadcasted or something? But on my phone, things are still greyed out?
As I posted my entire balance to send, I have literally 0 btc left in my wallet to "race attack" and send another transaction. . . 
. . . so I guess I just sit back and wait from here? Maybe a few hours? Maybe a few days? Thanks again for all the advice folks!
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:37:15
Wait eh?. . . Any ideas how long? Otherwise I guess there's no way to "cancel" this kind of transaction?
