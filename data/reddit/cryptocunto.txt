See semantic change:
"Semantic change. ... In diachronic (or historical) linguistics, semantic changeis a change in one of the meanings of a word. Every word has a variety of senses and connotations, which can be added, removed, or altered over time, often to the extent that cognates across space and time have very different meanings."

@_date: 2018-05-02 21:23:53
If 51% of the nodes agrees then that's the concensus according to the Satoshi white paper. That bit isn't rocket science.
Which, incidentally, is what bcash couldn't achieve. So they forked of like a loony from a plane.

@_date: 2018-05-02 19:56:43
I'm not technically competent to comment on that. I suppose, based on what i do know, is that software development is a bit messy at times. I wouldn't fret...both Bitcoin and BCH use similar methodologies in development. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 19:48:47
1. No i didn't.
2.  Read the flipping white paper you guys are so het up on.  It couldn't be plainer. Satoshi actually mentions  the number of CPU'S in determining consensus, that and the longest chain as being Bitcoin, which in BCH's case only goes back to last August.
Mate, you can twist and turn on the hook all you like, but if you can read, which i assume you can,  then my point is made.
That said, best of luck to BCH.

"Whataboutism", as you childishly put it, is really "relevant equivalency". In other words, if you preach a certain attitude you must live it yourself or your entire argument must be invalid.  If you don't understand that nobody can help you further. Remain in ignorance.
@_date: 2018-05-01 22:21:10
See how that flys in the other sub. 
 BCH has a narrative of actually owning Bitcoin, but unfortunately can't claim it due to some technical reasons.  That's why they put in artificial qualifiers. "" Bitcoin Core " and" Bitcoin Cash". They are BOTH Bitcoin, see?
The simple truth is that on 1 August 2017 Bitcoin forked for about the 1000th time and that altcoin became a different thing. Whatever it is now, it's no longer Bitcoin.
In fact, the most valuable thing about BCH is the name Bitcoin which they nicked.  Take that away and all they have left is a Litecoin derivative.

To me if someone mentions core it is a simple identifier for a bcash shill.

There may be a general misunderstanding on both our parts, this being reddit and all?
I have actually forgotten the original point and can't be bothered to backtrack through all the threads to reread who said what. Claim this as a victory if you are so inclined.
I guess my main point from memory, is that the white paper permits changes as consensus through majority votes of the working nodes. If a proposal can't achieve that, it fails. I believe that segwit x2 failed the test and was abandoned?
By the way, i am not a white paper maximalist. It is too vague in parts and can be interpreted many different ways. Just like any religious testament.
Either way, you win  i just can't anymore!
@_date: 2018-05-28 06:04:52
That still doesn't make it btc no matter how hard you squint. The fact that r/btc existed before last August doesn't make it a bcash sub by any logic.

At this stage of development it is all crypto geeks.  It will remain so until mainstream adoption. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 05:35:52
You are wrong. Absolutely wrong.
The last sentence in the introduction, Satoshi writes:
"The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacking nodes".  Namely, less than 51%.
Also, i direct your attention to the last sentence of the white paper which explains how rules through a consensus mechanism can be enforced by voting with their CPU power.  
If bcash couldn't succeed in their attack on Bitcoin it was because they had the minority view.  Don't take my word for it, but you might take Satoshi's... 
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:35:25
That's an odd, unexplained thing from left field? 
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:20:10
You have said everything needing saying and covered all the points well.
I do notice the bcash tactic of engaging in a "measured debate".  All this does is to give them another platform to copy pasta the same tired old arguments that have been addressed 1000 times already.  They do it for fresh eyes in the crypto space, looking for new suckers every day.
I'm past trying to reason with them. They want to be seen as equals without earning the right.

You are completely ignoring the almost infinite divisibility of Bitcoin. A fraction of a Bitcoin is also deflationary. You don't need a whole coin to buy stuff. A few sats can buy food in the future. It stands to reason by any logic because that's what deflationary actually means.  Don't judge a new currency type by the ancient monetary way. In saxon times silver was fiat. They traded in 'hack silver", or a person would hack off a little portion of a silver blob to buy stuff. In that way you could both hold wealth as a store of value but also buy stuff.
Bitcoin is dead in the water if everyone just sat on it forever. This won't happen, there is no long term incentive if it is utterly unaffordable.

Market dominance is neither important nor permanent. The only reason that Bitcoin lost dominance is that 1600 altcoins flowed into the market and investors started chasing shiny new things.
Human nature explains why. Bitcoin went from micro cents to 20k in less than ten years. And it has dropped a bunch, true, but that price increase bitch-slapped a great many people. Believing that they missed the BTC bus, people began searching for the next shiny Crypto. The search goes on today.
If there was only one car in the world that car company would undoubtedly have market dominance. The fact that is that there are hundreds of car companies. Does not having market dominance mean that any one car company is doomed?
Yet in crypto that kind of market dominance thinking always alludeds to the death of Bitcoin. It is as if the world can only have one kind of beer, pizza or chair.  The coin will stand or fall on many measures, but market dominance won't be the linchpin. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:50:40
That, with respect, is a whole lot of crap. 
The thing about the great depression of the 1920s was that the rich had tons of money. Tons.  They just didn't spend it so there was none in circulation. The poor just couldn't get their hands on any at all. After the depression ended the rich felt free to spend again under the old inflationary system.
No rich bastard starved, plenty poor people did.

@_date: 2018-03-17 00:56:09
2018 was always going to be rocky (personal opinion) and I thought that even before the ATH. The price spike last November shoved Bitcoin’s crotch into the face of mainstream media and everything flowed from that. Tulips, moon, hodling, Lambos, bubbles, FOMO, and especially FUD.
This year will force crypto into the next phase whatever that phase may look like. All I know is that it will be like shiting a watermelon sometimes. I have a five year outlook and will not be surprised whatever happens. The price will likely go up and down like a whore's drawers for a while yet.

You are either a concern troll or just this minute walked into crypto. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:25:46
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:05:00
It is not in the least stupid. The tactic is deliberately designed to create confusion. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:00:35
I hear what you are saying, but the power of silence can also be effectively used by your enemies when you surrender the field to them. 
 In the 70s scientists tried ignoring creationism by ignoring it. Starving it of oxygen, as they said.  The tactic failed in that the only voices heard was that of anti-evolution. The problem got bigger and is now a large scale pest.  The same with the ant-vax clowns.  If you think looking the other way and avoiding a word will fix the problem i think, with respect, that you are mistaken.
I hate the stupid argument too, and tried reason at first, then ignoring them and now they get bolder with the lies.  No more.

Ver is hard at work testing Bitcoin's anti-fraud proofing. After he goes broke the Bitcoin community should award him a tin medal for services rendered. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:05:15
Me neither, besides that. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:08:45
Huh? 
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:19:44
Because the whole scaling debate is a red hering for bcash's real reason for existing. Covert cheating via a copyrighted technical advantage is why Ver forked. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:51:43
Nice summary. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:28:37
I don't care about the fork in the least. It's the misrepresentation that is the fraud. Promoting one coin under the guise of another is fraud. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:59:55
Ver has forked of it. Claims that he has the real Bcash Coiin. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:07:31
Let's put it this way: Satoshi original stash could be successfully sent to a BTC wallet. It couldn't be sent to a BCH wallet. That is because Bitcoin is Bitcoin and Bcash is an altcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 03:46:50
They are monetary motivated to ignore reality. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:04:10
You must be new here... 
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:00:47
A whole bunch of imaginary things. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:31:33
Let us ask the Bitcoin king to decide?
Or, everybody just decides to drop the fraud and let the market decide.
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:14:29
Funny i kept hearing it was going to drop to about 600 bucks. It just shows that people who predict prices pluck them from their butthole. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:14:34
You  called out shit, you just denied fraud.  No proof, no explaining the illogic, you just made an assertion.
For myself, i don't particularly care what you support or don't support.  You are just another rude prick on the interwebs. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:55:32
So a "law" as it applies to transistors should naturally be applied to crypto. Is that your argument?
Jeeze, you bcash shills are not even trying anymore... 
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:15:46
Get back ON the bus - not to the BACK of the bus.
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:34:05
Don't forget that about a year ago it was $1,000 USD.  If you live in the short term everyday is a fright.  Just buy the stuff and check in every six months or so and you'll be smiling. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:04:26
Bitcoin isn't a version - it's the original. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:57:10
Sez the Chinese miner's altcoin promoter.  Bcash is about as centralised as you can get. All the bcash nodes are actually related. When segwit came in it  inadvertently bumped Ver's cheating boost off the grid so he spit the the dummy and created bcash. 
I don't blame him, if i had a bunch of slavish dolts taking my orders i doubt that i could resist either. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:03:33
Get back on the bus. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:54:51
Have an up vote! 
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:38:15
This is kind of our fault at this point. Ver and bcash's methodologies are well known. They are just going to appropriate everything Bitcoin if we let them. Their social engineering practice is on point. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 19:38:06
Oh no... 
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:02:03
The dude must have been dropping LSD if he invented bcash. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:13:30
The whole ignore it thing is not necessarily helpful... This should be obvious by now. Time to start openly fighting back.
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:56:07
Sure, if you are seriously favourably comparing bcash to dodge... 
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:21:10
Pump and dumps can never be sustained. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 02:58:13
Unless you got yourself elected King of Crypto, you're opinions are also as relevant as that of a dog squatting in the grass. 
The difference between us is that I already except that mine are too  but you think that you can decide what is relevant and what is not based on your own opinion.
Good luck with that. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 02:59:41
What you may fail to understand is that Bitcoin price goes up and it goes down.  If you have anxiety about crypto investment perhaps you might try something else?
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:24:52
Depending upon how long you live? 
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:31:41
The white paper isn't a religious text. Anyway, it called for development through concensus.  Something that bcash couldn't achieve. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:16:33
How bout you put this shitpost there and stop being a jerk. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:50:34
Simple question: Are you trying to make a clumsy strawman argument?
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:06:59
Ignore them?
That's how they appropriated Bitcoin’s name all over the place. Many Bitcoin supporters are complaining about the childish war all the while the place is being taken over piece by piece.
Feel free to sit back and let it happen, if you want, but allow others to fight back.
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:04:18
I think that he's new here... 
@_date: 2018-04-28 00:48:32
That, at least, is true. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:25:06
Nope, you guys created a branch line to Nowheresville. Population YOU. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:32:51
You can be as cautious as you like in warning others, but if newcomers go to Bitcoin.com they will not even see your cautious warnings. They may buy bcash thinking its Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:10:28
Not impressed with your claimed credentials. Bitcoin is not bcash for reasons you should already be familiar with. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:43:53
Ah... You found the Bitcoin Cash White Paper! 
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:58:39
If an aeroplane is flying from point A to point B and some clown jumps out of the aeroplane with a parachute, did the plane fork?
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:01:37
I used to think that too... Until i observed Ver's tactics. Not anymore. Fuck them and their lies. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:49:11
The whole point of bcash is that nobody should be able to tell them what to do. Therefore we are free to do the same. And, if you think that r/Bitcoin is toxic, Babydoll, you better not stumble into the other sub. If they couldn't smash Bitcoin they wouldn't know what to post. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:53:09
Nope, we hate bcash because the facts are obvious. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:36:40
You from the Old Testament?
Who the the fuck are you with all this privileged information that you have to "warn" us? 
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:47:23
Yeah, pity bcash and the Bitcoin chain are not compatible so therefore any links to 2011 are non-existent. Therefore bcash is just another altcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:07:40
Exactly. None of his work is accidental. Fraud takes a bit of work. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:04:27
I'll correct that for you. "If the market wants bcash.... Yarda yarda yarda....".
