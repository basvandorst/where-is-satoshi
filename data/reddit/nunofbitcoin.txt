Yup, but Paxful is definitely not for pussies. blep

SInce it is a good service, might as well bank on their customer service. The live chat has saved me lots of dollars

This is honestly how I have my iProducts &gt;:)

I think it's worth a shot. I've been on it for months and no problems so far.

Have you tried peer to peer trading? The process on Paxful is pretty fast and I've traded with a lot of folks from the US
@_date: 2018-11-02 11:59:08
Peer to peer has made everyone a businessman, especially now with the demand for bitcoins! I heard it's now legal in Hong Kong among other places.

Yeah, they should really be getting in on this action if they really care for Venezuela. u/ray_paxful

Trade on your own as much as possible. This is why we learn the trade. But if you do lend your bitcoin to other people for investment, make sure you're fine with the possibility of them running away with it.

I don't know about them but strategies like that aren't new. IMO, since I'm a Paxful user, I get notified when they have news. They're doing a lot of charity (most probably for PR), like the schools they built for Rwanda, the scholarships for Afghans, them feeding Venezuelans, the Lagos innovation hub, I forgot the others. Note that these guys are clearly using their company for profit (Paxful is a decentralized P2P exchange, fyi), but they also evidently have a budget for social responsibility work as well. It may be just for PR or whatever, but people are benefiting for it, sooo I'm assuming this is what bitcoin will come to in the future. I honestly think these bitcoin companies are racing towards these countries with failing currencies, it's just a matter of how.

I thought they lifted the ban? [

I wish you'd be interested to learn more about this great currency but yeah, I understand you might need the money so I highly suggest you get it exchanged as soon as you can while the price is relatively high or I'm assuming higher than when your uncle started. It changes more or less every few hours. Sorry for your loss, be careful!

As long as we can really expect them to increase the quality of the website as well as its content, I have no qualms about the sponsorship. I do draw the line on their written content being explicitly leaning toward just their sponsors, but so far, if it's just the page, I can ignore it and go to wherever I need to go.

Here's a super simple YouTube channel, haha [

Isn't this what Bitpay is for? :)

Yeah for now I want to smart small, 1BTC is cool. I'll then grow it and trade maybe half of it from there. The other half to HODL

I guess because with their support, it gets easier to convince the more close minded individuals to believe in Bitcoin. I'm not for it either, other people are just being stupid. Also, not everyone is comfortable with Lightning (no hate intended).
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:31:48
Is there a place/list for bitcoin meetups? I really want to meet more people in the community
@_date: 2018-07-13 06:43:27
Might be useful: [
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:42:28
I'd appreciate a lower price. More opportunities to buy that dip. hehe
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:49:09
NICE. SAME! Great companies
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:47:19
YES, I'm waiting for the next "dip"
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:59:02
Just trade your bitcoin with someone who can transfer the cash to your bank account. That's what I use my Paxful account for, I only get cash when I need it and plus I get a profit.
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:02:33
Are you looking for a straight-up exchange or are you planning to start buying and selling Bitcoin? Because for straight up exchanges I use Abra or Coinbase and then for buying and selling bitcoin, it's Paxful. Depends what you need the Bitcoin for. I usually use bitcoins to buy and sell and get extra money ;)
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:46:56
Well, you should've been smarter then
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:22:49
Same goes with bitcoin
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:23:38
Why did you connect your crypto to your bank? \*grimaces\*
