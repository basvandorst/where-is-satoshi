You are more than welcome to join! There will be an after party at the Bitcoin Embassy. Free course tickets are on: 
@_date: 2015-06-13 22:33:54
In the bitcoin ecosphere we have various skills and levels of competence. Some prefer to read the downloaded blocks by the core deamon themselves, others prefer to stick with an API. To make the course easy and accessible to all we opted for an API. We will have many more of these events, every time a different API vendor / provider / third party app. As the Bitcoin Embassy Amsterdam we want to encourage and empower people to start working on blockchain projects, beginning with a core deamon course will distract beginners as it is too complicated for many.

There is no proof that hackers took any of the money and they might as well emptied the accounts themselves. They should be held accountable and therefore I will join a potential lawsuit even if the only result is that BIPS.ME is shut down it is worth it to prevent further damage. Companies like BIPS give the Bitcoin community a bad name.

The title should read BIPS.ME or more specifically stole over a million dollars from their clients and continue to do business as usual. Don't fall for this scam, do your research and search Google for BIPS.ME lawsuit or BIPS.ME scam...... I feel sorry for the shopify owners that are going to be scammed next. I was one of the prestashop owners that got robbed by BIPS.ME.... Since then Mr.  KRIS HENRIKSEN bought a new suit, a galaxy watch and moved on to the next target. Shopify....  Good luck.

The person behind BIPS.ME is  
Kris Henriksen
Founder &amp; CEO of BIPS, 
Denmark  - Internet
Current BIPS
Education: TEC
61 (connections on linkedin)
Summary: 31 years young entrepreneur, among other things (like scamming), owns and operates BIPS. "The world's leading way to make payments in Bitcoin online and beyond." 
I guess the beyond means that is where your Bitcoins will go if you use their service. There are no replies ever to helpdesk tickets on where our funds went, if you complain on G+ or Youtube you will just get blocked. The linkedin profile is real and shows Kris in a cheap suit, before he emptied out our wallets, I think he will be wearing something better now after stealing over a million USD from his clients.

I got a similar reply from their helpdesk. It was impossible to cash out small amounts because of their self imposed threshhold. As such BIPS is responsible. If BIPS can't refund, they are out of business but they continue to do business so they need a little help.... Sign up for the lawsuit here:

And next thing all your balances are emptied out and BIPS.ME ceo buys a new car. BIPS is a scam!

This is exactly the reason why people purchase a GENERAL BYTES Bitcoin ATM instead! This should NEVER EVER happen!

for a small fee it stores your document on the s3 cloud too. Handy if you are too lazy to use dropbox. I don't think the site mentioned above does that?

This is exactly what we did at first but found it is not easy for newcomers so that's why we have the option for paypal nowadays.

Not yet but it's rather easy to use: 
- visit 
- drag file onto square to upload (no mobile, use chrome for now)
- send 0.0002 to the address listed and wait for confirmation.
- once confirmed you get the transaction ID where your document's signature lives on the blockchain.
