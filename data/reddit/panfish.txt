Do you buy your groceries with bitcoin? Or do you buy them with gift cards paid for with bitcoin? What are the gift cards denominated in? What are your groceries priced in?
If you're buying potatoes for 3 mBTC/pound and paying at the register with your phone, then I stand corrected.

So why would he tell people to keep mining? That is effectively giving money away by reducing the efficiency of his own mines.
Are we to believe he's running a charitable institution?

True dis. Bitcoins are a useful technology for specific uses. Bitcoins are not magic beans.

 Yeah, the cost benefit to forging an American Eagle is much lower. You'd have to fake the more complex surface detail or do a "micro-hollow" job on a real AE. Then the Secret Service would be on your ass for counterfeiting instead of just the bank goons. (Although the bank goons would probably beat the hell out of you and throw you out of a helicopter instead of just incarceration.)

Yeah, I know. I thought I was going to see single digits. Or that the whole shebang was a North Korean scam based on a faulty elliptical curve to generate hard currency.

As someone else notes below, the premiums only cover a small fraction of the insured amount. If there's a systemic failure or a biiiig bank goes down, the taxpayer is gonna be on the hook.
@_date: 2013-07-10 01:46:55
No amount is too small. One of the whole points is that they're nearly infinitely divisible.
That's like saying you shouldn't save your nickels because the Cu/Ni in them is only worth 0.04-0.08 FRN. Or that the bank shouldn't bother giving you the interest on your balance because it's only 0.3%.

Utility is only subjective at a theoretical level, not at the practical level where human beings live.
Fresh meat is more useful than rotten meat. Pure copper is more useful than unrefined ore.

How do you expect an unskilled investor to compare the riskiness of Bank of Carlos vs. Bank of Dmitri?

But it wouldn't make sense to sell an asset that appreciates by 100% per week in order to avoid paying 4% per year interest.
It's only funny if the OPs are miners and are literally multimillionaires.

Why the heck would you spend your BTC to buy something instead of your Federal Reserve Notes? Survivalists have been deriding FRNs for decades and their advice is to use your FRNs to buy things of value (for them, gold, guns, and productive farmland) and not sell your valuables.

You can find an institution that does not participate in FDIC if you try really hard. Finding one that isn't a scam or run by (and for the benefit of) shady characters is harder.
Why would an average Joe ever choose a wildcat bank over an insured one?
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:10:25
I don't have the skills or the time to audit prospective banks. I would have to put my trust in independent auditors.
But how would I certify that the auditors are competent and honest? We can't trust the big accounting firms; look at Arthur Andersen.

This statement is not accurate.
Participating banks DO pay premiums based on their insured quantity and the riskiness of the bank.

It's true that the plants built in the 1960s have some issues. Modern designs avoid a lot of those issues, but there aren't too many of them getting built.
Think of the safety features (or lack therof) in a car built in the 1960s. They would be considered completely unacceptable today, but people don't think less of modern cars because of them

Common misconception.
Oil is priced in dollars. It can be bought with Canadian dollars, Euros, Baht, or those giant rocks they use down Polynesia-way.
If you go to Calgary, I guarantee you will be able to use pictures of the Queen to buy yourself a tanker full of oil. If you head to Brunei and want to give the Sultan four ounces of silver for a barrel, he'd be cool with that.

There are some non participating banks. But they're probably Ponzi schemes or money laundrying centers.

Try to get more than spot unless you're really desperate. You bought the coin at spot plus a coinage premium plus tax (sometimes). You should try to get that some of that back.
If spot is $30/oz, you can't buy a one oz coin for $30. There is a value to the verified assay and weight. You could pay $31-34, plus tax depending on jurisdiction and the size of your order. If spot goes to $40 and you need cash, try to sell for $43 and only settle for $40

Enzo makes an important point here. How is an average investor supposed to independently evaluate counterparty risk? 
If you have your jetski fund in Bank of Bieber and BOB holds instruments that rely on Bank of Gomez' ability to pay, are you really going to go to Tulsa and look at the houses that BOG holds the mortgage on to see if they're full of mold?

Let's say a lady in India wants to buy coffee beans from Nicaragua. What's the volume of exchanges from Rupees to Nicaraguan pesos? Not big. So how do you know you are getting a reliable price? You exchange Rupees for USD or EUR, then the USD/EUR for pesos.
I thought this example was going to support your point, but now that I wrote out I'm not so sure.
(I'm assuming they use pesos in Nicaragua because I am teh raycess.)

The real effect of btc is going to be lower cc fees and lower remittance fees. The wildcat alternative (btc) is going to exert downward price pressure on the cc and remittance companies who were basically collaborating and pricefixing before.

When a bank fails, they still have some assets. Only the difference between assets and liabilities needs to be made up by FDIC payout.
Your concern only comes into play when there is a string of failures, like what occurred in the S&amp;L scandal.
