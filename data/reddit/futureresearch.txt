"wreak massive havoc" is way over the top. Price would go down for a bit on large sell orders but so what? The Chinese and Japanese Central Banks each hold trillions of US dollars in forex reserves. It's like worrying the Swiss National Bank can "wreak massive havoc" because they've got $600 billion.

Controlling the monetary system enables them to pay for initiating that force against individuals. It's not cheap to keep all those bureaucrats, military, tax collectors and police officers fed and willing to get out of bed in the morning. 
Bitcoin cutting into the dollars market share will test the allegiances of those employees when the ability for the government to write a cheque is no longer unlimited

Bitcoin's ultimately fixed money supply means we won't have to suffer this:
"The Federal Reserve right now is trying to ward off technological deflation by having a target 2% inflation rate a year.
Yet economists I have read peg technological deflation at around 3% to 4% a year presently.
When nanotechnology really takes off and prices plummet 75-80% and technological deflation goes from 4% to 10% and then possibly 20% a year or more what is the FED going to do?
Will we have a race between technological deflation and the “printing press?” A fight between two exponential functions-the singularity versus exponential inflation and debt! It’s absurd!"

Well that's up to them, I'll still use it and enjoy the deflation

How much of the dollar market do a handful of people at the Federal Reserve control? They can double or triple the monetary base if they feel like it

Unlike with the Federal Reserve System there's no need to trust Satoshi with anything. He can't increase the monetary base any more than you or I can even if he owns more bitcoins than us.

How did he fix it? 
I've got the same problem sending from my blockchain wallet (problem started today).
