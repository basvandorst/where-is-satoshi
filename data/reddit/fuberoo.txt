There was a bitcoin shorting site called Bitcoinica run by a guy called Zhoutong who ran off with most of the money in Feb last year. Amir's company Intersango stepped in to the middle of the mess, before it was apparent Zhoutong had been the thief, and took control of the remaining funds, planning to re-distribute what was left of everyone's coins back to their original owners. They didn't do what they promised because of the mess Zhoutong left, in fact after they took over things there was another hack and more funds were stolen. I personally don't think Amir did anything bad he was stuck in the middle of a bad situation with his hands tied.
 
Please feel free to correct any inaccuracies, I only had half an eye on the whole bitcoinica thing at the time...
I didn't agree with Amir's rhetoric in some previous interviews, he sounded like just the right kind of 'naive idealist, anti-establishment' type that would push various rational, skeptic, and especially conservative enquiring minds away from bitcoin. He seems to have toned that down now though.

I bought 35 bitcoins from a Norwegian during the Olympic games in London. He found a use for them, currency exchange.

**When will you be adding Litecoin (LTC) to Mt. Gox?**
*Soon. We were planning on doing so two weeks ago, but events derailed that plan. Right
now we are focused on overall stability of the exchange, and will launch LTC when we are
ready. Otherwise we could be further complicating things.*
Arize Chickun!

Bitcoin can switch crypto algorithm if needed.

Additionally, they have made the ASIC chips themselves available to people wishing to fabricate their own boards ...
[bitcointalk thread](
IIRC the lead developer of the Avalon project was also responsible for the 'icarus' FPGA boards which have since been cloned, maybe someone else could clarify on this though.

You've hit the nail right on the head. This alleged BTC wealth was not created through imperialism, slavery or corporate shenanigans, so why should the holder suddenly start using such tactics?

I would use this.

*The solution to the [double spend problem](
*The immediate and unstoppable transfer of currency across political borders for a net cost of upto 0.0005btc
*Silk Road - a working example that we can publicly trade what we want despite our "lords and masters" best efforts. Enabled via bitcoin and DPR's ingenuity.
*Security - the fact that unless you give away your private keys it would take a million years to have your money stolen.
*Trust that your savings will not be inflated away by an issuer.
*The mining network discouraging a takeover attempt by a third party.
That's what I see backing bitcoin.

Amir would be a great person to invite onto a show if I wanted to ward people away from Bitcoin. /tinfoil_hat

No, this attitude is buffering the price from going even lower.
