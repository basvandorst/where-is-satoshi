Ugg. This argument again.  Also, nobody mentioned the US.

Err, she looks really young. ..

I'm guessing you've never been to zombo.com

This is good for bitcoin

Because only fat people can have a problem with people hating fat people.

Isn't that the preferred nomenclature?

You don't think the average European (a place in which many governments are social democracies) is left of the average person from the US (A place where the tea party exists)?

Ahh, just like how they shut down wikileaks.
@_date: 2011-06-24 14:02:50
Everyone here thinks that. No need to circle jerk.

You don't need to put *all* your money into gold. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 03:58:03
Diversify. Different banks, term deposits, gold, shares, bitcoin. Particularly anything that's guaranteed. If you have your money in enough different places it probably won't all go down at once. If it does you have bigger things to worry about.

capitalism =/= extreme free market capitalism. I'm not saying that bank bail outs are a good idea, but saying "either you believe in capitalism or you don't" doesn't really leave room for the scope of differences that a capitalist society can have.

Term deposit with CBA in Australia. Guaranteed by the government.

Pretty sure you can, unless you need your entire amount of money to be completely liquid all the time.

I don't know what you mean by that... I'm getting a guaranteed ~5% on one account, and an (almost) guaranteed ~9% on another . 
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:10:04
That's useless... get some bitcoin.

What exactly is a credit union?

It shouldn't be possible to lose it all. A sizable chunk should always be in low risk investments (such as a guaranteed institution). Investing everything is high risk investments (such as bit-coin) is a really bad idea. Borrowing to invest is really not a risky proposition if you go about it safely and conservatively.

In the US that minimum wage is ~$2/hour. It necessitates living off of peoples tips.
@_date: 2013-02-13 07:34:58
That's not true at all. Pretty much all the financial institutions leverage in order to make much faster profits... and even for a private investor as long as you have a diverse portfolio and can beat the interest on your loan, you will end up with more money than you would have if you just invested your capital.

Depends on who wears it.

There is no evidence that this is bitcoin related.
