I am interested.
Please make it easy to sign up and pay.
What features are you thinking about having?

Yes...this cryptothrift.com theme is getting out of hand.
There has been several threads on the same topic recently.
It's a pretty obvious shill.

You're right. It's weird that they both started on the same day. Probably looking for a way to get some attention.

Ok final guess. It could have climbed by close to double since I last sent you a Morse code message via an analog cassette that was never connected to the internet.
 ?

wickedfire just a guess.

Thanks for the great reply, very helpful.
I am going to look into the code and see if it is something that my team could implement realistically.
One question, if a buyer and seller party had a successful transaction using bitrates, would it be possible to then send the funds through Cyrptsy or another exchange via API? 
In this instance the seller once paid wanted to get his currency in dogecoin, could the bitcoin be sent through an exchange like Cryptsy via API and then be available to the seller once the currency exchange was complete? Curious if bitrated could work in a fashion like that.
Thanks again.

This is great.
I have a question.
Is there a way to use bitrated without having to leave the marketplace.
For example if the old bitmit were to use bitarated, they buyer and seller would agree on terms and decide to use multi sig protection.
Once they agree is there a way to use bitrated without having to leave buitmit? Such as an iframe or other technique? Or do they buyer and seller both have to go directly to the bitrated site in order to create the multi sig transaction?

I would have to say...facebook is...like a website n stuff.

Gracias :-)

ok, I am somewhat hip and if I start a site I will use the meta tag.
Best of luck getting this meta tag out there.

I would request that my btc be paid from a mtgox bitcoin account in cash, and wired to the bank of my choice in Sweden with a helicopter waiting on the roof. Then I will do the research.
If so you have a deal mister.

I was trying to get the live stream as well.
bitcoinist says they have a "live stream" a live stream of tweets, lol.
I found this Dutch site that said they would be streaming it but I can't get the video to play.
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:40:40
I think you are getting technical then.
I would request .00001% of a btc from you kind sir :-)

Is this only an issue for digital good type products? I don't think it would be a problem for physical goods, correct?
@_date: 2014-05-18 21:41:38
I wasn't responding to solely your post friend.
@_date: 2014-05-18 02:05:48
I think it is a great idea OP.
How do you get things like this implemented? Is it dependent on what search engines crawlers choose to recognize? How does it get standardized?
I was trying to find coinmap.com ,  but figured out it is actually coinmap.org
