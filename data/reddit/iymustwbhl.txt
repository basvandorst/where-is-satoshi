Once people move the funds to the exchange, the BTC trading pairs still dominate.

Hmmm. Just for fun I checked Bitfinex right now to see the blend:
Of $3,141M in sales volume today:
- $1,337M is with a BTC pair
-  $47M is with a ETH pair
- $1,748M is with a USD pair.
 The USD pair also includes the BTC/USD and ETH/USD volume. But a cursory look seems to support my hunch (I didn't do a real analysis) that BTC is the dominant reserve pair.
Maybe someone with better stats chops can confirm BTC trading pair dominance.

But not when it comes to reliably being a store of value once funds are moved onto the exchange.

Bitcoin is the reserve currency of the entire crypto market. When peeps move in and out of alts, they use BTC. 
Just look at all the alt dumps, right now even, BTC is even commanding a premium on some markets.
With SEGWIT plus Lightning Networks, there will be an entire ecosystem of payment networks and providers. People will have the option to be on-chain with high value lower fee TX and the option of express rapid payment ultra low fee wallets and payer circles that can add on Rootstock and other smart contract enhanced services.
Don't let me try to twist your arm! When this comes to fruition, and it will soon enough, many new fangled, unproven, dangerously centralized and attack vulnerable networks will just cease to exist.
I can't wait for 2018 and 2019 and 2020 with my BTC safe and sound in my Ledger.
I really enjoy seeing the alts bloom. And I really enjoy seeing them buying and selling from all the pump n dumps using BTC!

Thanks for the explanation.

ooops. I meant to link to the other thread. Please keep all discussions there.

Right. So then doesn't 'availability' apply to the situation where it become necessary to wait for many confirmations - such as when the network is known to be under attack and retailer users might be advised to be more patient?
How about partition tolerance, wouldn't that apply in the even of a router attack on the network?
I'm throwing those out there - I don't know. But that is what comes immediately to mind.

I wonder what is going to happen when there is no clear majority fork? It's all easy while clarity remains. All I know is that 2018 is going to be an epic year for popcorn sales.

Wall street is looking at the current shenanigans and laughing with glee. They aim to make a killing.
The house always wins.
