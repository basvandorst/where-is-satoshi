There you go. My latest bank transactions. The last one is my paycheck. The first, my second bitcoin purchase.

No idea. I live near a bitcoin atm actually.
I see people using it and the person there told me most buy tiny amounts. Thats all Ive got.

My first buy was an investment yes.
But after this I just believed. 
It may be a mistake. I dont care. Im thrilled that Im a part of this.  I will not sell ever, let them go to zero. 
Those money would carry me a few months if unemployed. If I am to reach that point might as well reach the bottom quicker. 
I dont want to be consumed by fear of losing money. Half the planet including me is on sris.
Young men and women drowned in anxiety worrying if they will make it to the end. Something is very wrong with our system.
Money are supposed to serve us not the other way around. 
Bitcoin might liberate us. The passion of its supporters, the vision and everything about it fill me with confidence.
Also regarding Greece...
Many are to blame in and out of the country.
But know that we reached that point instantly.
There was no build up. We were not seeing it coming. Just one day we woke up and heared the news. The debt is a worldwide problem. Noone is in the clear. A few countries just happened to get there first.

I work 70 hours a week. Monday to Sunday 10 hours a day. No day off.
The multinational company I work cut the workforce in half the last 5 years and those that remain have to work for two.
