I have never seen someone say do "noverify" what does bitcointip do differently w/ verify vs noverify?

Nah she constantly shared articles of different companies accepting bitcoin. Like 50% of posts were "look this random gas station in my town now accepts bitcoins"

Assume he means relative to the world population. Which is most likely true if you have the amount of money required to own a computer, have internet access, and buy bitcoin

Are you serious? The San Bernadine phone was hacked into. It was just done by an Israeli firm, he offered the gov't to do it for free but an Israeli company did it for the government first. I know "breaking encryption" and finding a back door arnt exactly the same thing, but I think the point was met.

I just don't like that you really have to do a direct bank deposit. I guess I could use paypal but then I have to do that trade through 2nd Life $ or whatever.

oh awesome. So I just go to my blockchain wallet and send them over to whatever wallet I am currently using, cool.

or go with the rush and open a bar... I guess bitcoin poker is the equivalent of a gold rush saloon.

localbitcoin only shows one seller in the city that the college is in. There are a few in pretty close cities that I bet would be willing to drive. I just havn't had the time to set it up. My guess is most the college kids with BTC are not trading them for cash but instead online (like I should be doing lol)

I know not all of you really care about legality when it comes to things like this, so please save me the "WHO CARES!" answers. Just curious, is BTC poker legal if only BTC trades hands while playing?

I see, same way you can "gamble" XP points in Call of Duty games. Do you take any extra precautions while playing? Whats your favorite site? Any advice?

Ya I was looking to do a cash transaction but I am at college so my transportation is very limited. Hopefully I can find a fair cash transaction price when I go home maybe over winter break.
