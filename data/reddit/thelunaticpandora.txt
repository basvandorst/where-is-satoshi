You're the one making the claim. Moreover, what if I just don't share your view? Why would that make me "stupid and uninformed"? I am more than willing to read any source you're willing to provide that suggests that Bitpay and others are detrimental to the space.

Miners get lazy sometimes and the the boss has to go through the line with the flogg. It's a process.

How many times do people have to be told that CLOUD MINING IS A SCAM, before it sinks? 
Come on OP.

I jist bought my latest phone with BTC. I'm currently paying off,my car with it too.

It isn't "redditors", it's people in general. Seeing the "enemy" behind a legal service based on Bitcoin seems to be unnecessarily conspiratorial. 
@_date: 2019-03-14 03:25:40
Sorry, just not seeing the "enemy" hyperbole. This kind of mentality is why adoption is so slow. We're going to have to accept the fact that adoption is going to take many forms and services. 
This whole "these people are the enemy" bullshit is just that, bullshit.

Andrew Yang's answer to automation is the effective obliteration of governing by consent. The UBI, which is what he's after, will ensure that people remain a ward of the state for eternity. It will be done at the expense of industries that it will be designed to destroy, it will be devastatingly inflationary, and in very short order, controlled by a central global government structure. 
Anyone can make free money from the government sound good. But Mr. "I do math so I'm smarter than everyone else" isn't nearly as smart as he thinks he is

Boy the French government really seems to know what the French people are all about.

I prefer to use bitcoin independently, but I can understand why someone would want to use a service like Bitpay. It's like having your hand held as you wade in.

Why are they the enemy?
@_date: 2019-03-26 12:28:48
Wow, its like we learned nothing from BitConnect.
@_date: 2019-03-03 22:32:34
Oh let me hurry and sell all of my BTC. 
After the bull run.

This article is pretty stupid. Who ever wrote it knows nothing about the crypto space at all. Facebook is a latecomer to the game and if they keep stealing people's data and faking 50% of their business nothing they do in the cryptospace will save them.

Coincidentally, also the best way to scale your mom.

Wow. 
These people have no shame. They should definitely go out of business.

Andrew yang is just another democrat who thinks free money from government is a real thing.

The "big correction" happened in 2017/18. This is real investment but no one seems to want to do the research.
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:00:05
It's like they don't know what this market is. 
Must be new.

Would you venture to say that it would be over 9000?

I'll bet you 7k in btc
@_date: 2019-05-09 06:13:24
Possibly. I fully intend to continue to accumulate BTC. I'm guessing so is everyone else.

We are coming off of what amounts to a depression for the crypto space and people wanna use the word "bubble" when we're still 60+% below ATHs?
Can we please pump the brakes on this?
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:10:03
Profit taking. Relax. We haven't seen the bull start to run yet.
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:00:28
Fine by me. Longer accumulation period.
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:14:55
None of this makes any sense at all. 
Bitcoin won't be the only ledger going forward and it can't be. The economy many are trying to build around cryptocurrencies requires a multi-ledger system and the protocols to go with it. 
Bitcoin may be king but the rest of the market is doing things the king can't. This isn't a bad thing. This is what innovation looks like.
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:52:55
Another idiot democrat speaks.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:11:45
In a market where a 20 % swing is common, calling the bears back seems a bit premature. 
Have you ever heard of profit taking?
