I lost 5.1 Btc on MtGox. I'm not holding out any hope whatsoever on getting it back. I'm lucky I started playing with Altcoins as it meant I'd already transferred most of my Btc out of Gox before the shit hit the fan.

 Shiller was NOT the "one dude" who was correct. Many people warned about the housing bubble long before it happened. Even the Bush admin tried to put the brakes on it before Congress (Democrat controlled at the time) shot down the attempt. Dodd-Frank anyone?
The ONLY way Bitcoin is going down is if the U.S. government bans it.

I'm neither dumb nor trolling. Please be nice.
47% of people in the USA have heard of Bitcoin. I bet that amount is nearer 0.00047% for those who have heard of the idea of breaking it down to Mbtc.  Bitcoin as it stands (and I own quite a few) risks alienating itself from the mainstream, most of whom watch reality TV for a hobby. I hate to say this but we have to dumb it down for the masses. 
If we can give Bitcoin universal appeal then all those TRULY dumb anti-Bitcoin newspaper articles and blogs (Krugman etc.) will miraculously go away. Those writers only troll their garbage when they think the majority either don't care or think they're right.

What needs to happen in order to avoid any such restrictions is for more and more of the big retailers (Amazon, Apple, Walmart etc.) to start accepting it as payment. Once the masses accept Bitcoin it will be hard for the politicians to vote against their voters....

You first. Proof that the 850K Bitcoin was "stolen"? That's too complicated. Always go for the simplest explanation. I also like the "Fractional Reserve" theory, very plausible. It's simply NOT plausible that 850K Btc have been stolen.
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:09:39
OP has a good point. For example, I've suggested to Ken Rockwell  that he start accepting Bitcoin. He hasn't heard of it and thinks it's for techhies only. Yet, his website, which is donation based, would make a lot more money if people like me could make micropayments to it. I'm simply not willing to hand out my credit card info. every time I want to make a 5 dollar payment.
Wikipedia would certainly benefit from accepting cryptocoin payments.

For the OP,

10 cents to 1 dollar = 1000%
1 dollar to 10 dollars = 1000%
10 dollars to 100 dollars = 1000%
100 dollars to 1000 dollars = 1000%
Dear Bitcoin...please give me two more of these 1000% jumps!

Stolen by people within Gox. Including Karpeles. That's MY hypothesis. If you have to choose between complex theories and simple ones the answer is almost always on the simple side.

I like the idea of Bitcoin "disrupting" Western Union, Moneygram, Pay Pal, bank wire transfers (and their crazy high fees) but I'm not all on board with the idea that it will disrupt governments. That's trouble for Bitcoin especially when you consider how "on board" the mainstream media are with the present administration. I already see that with the MSM....90% of their articles about Bitcoin are very negative.
As far as listening to you (Andreas) and listening to others, I listen to everyone if they're interesting. You certainly are.

Volume will be low for weeks to come. A lot of people withdrew their coins from the exchanges and put them in personal wallets. I know I did. Such actions slow impulse and panic trading (it takes time to transfer the coin to an exchange for a trade) and so volume is down and stability is up.
@_date: 2014-01-22 18:34:45
Unless Bitcoin adds a few zeros then alts like Dogecoin will succeed. Normal everyday folk don't have time to think about millybits, satoshis, 8 decimal places, one hundred millionth and all the other gump that Bitcoin's current scarcity causes. The Bitcoin community of which I'm a part of, needs to agree to add a few zeros to the number of Btc in existence. Let's agree to add 4 zeros. Someone's 50 Btc (currently worth about $40,000) would become 500,000 Btc, still worth about $40,000 but removing all that fractional decimal satoshi millybit crap which confuses the shit out of people.
Until then there's a HUGE place for Dogecoin in the crypto coin market.
@_date: 2014-01-21 17:17:24
I just upvoted you. Mind you, 36 hours ago had you bought Dogecoin with Bitcoins you'd be 300% richer.....

One more point: The more acceptance Bitcoin has amongst everyday folk the less likely it'll ever be banned by the politicians.

No way that business can be "revived"...in order for Gox to make money people will have to trade on it. More smoke and mirrors.

If Doge performs just 1/5th as well over the next 12 months as it has over its first 45 days it will have a CAP of $500 million.
Doge is no fluke. Just look at Reddit, close to 40,000 shibes with over 1000 being added every day.
Bitcoin is a pump and dump instrument but that doesn't make it unsuccessful. The key is that after the dump Bitcoin has a huge userbase ready to buy low. Dogecoin also has its big userbase and many of them are Bitcoin fans too.
@_date: 2014-02-23 02:53:16
If Gox survives Bitcoin will thrive. If Gox collapses Bitcoin will pause and then thrive. What markets hate is uncertainty and currently MtGox is masterfully providing plenty of that.

I believe very few coins were "lost" by MtGox. See my post. Remember, always follow the simplest explanation when looking for the truth.

If a blank page means MtGox is "Up" then yaaaayyy.......
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:42:38
Depends....if most people did what I did after the fall of Gox, which is I got all of my coins out of all of the exchanges I'm registered with, then hopefully it'll encourage the exchanges to be more responsible. Gox had huge stashes of customer Fiat and Btc stored there and so it was easy for them to "pyramid-ponzi" at least until the two big bubbles came along. If we use the exchanges ONLY when we want to trade and then get the coin/fiat out of them quickly there won't be the time for the exchanges to dig themselves such deep holes.

Dogecoin's huge userbase already assures that there can be no quick slide into oblivion. In any case all coin is experimental in nature given that most folk agree that anyone buying Bitcoin for the first time today is still a relatively early adopter.

Well, I'm a newbie to this. I like the article because MOST of it gives compelling argument to the strength of Bitcoin. Even if there are technical errors here and there none of those fundamentally change the premise being made, that Bitcoin is and will continue to be a pretty fabulous investment.
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:58:51
Some interesting and fair points here.
"1" is always the case...
"2" is plausible and frightening.
I think "3" above could be explained by the continuing cooling off in China offsetting any Western World good news. Also it takes time for newbies to open up accounts with the exchanges. Today's good news might not affect the system for 7 - 21 days. In the meantime we're still feeling the effects of the China bad news cycle.

"Psychology" being critical as first time crypto-currency investors see Litecoin as being more affordable, even if it isn't. There is definitely room for 2 or 3 Big Boys in the crypto-currency game.

"then there are about 288 times more gold ounces than there are bitcoins by my estimates. " true if one counts all of the unissued Bitcoins.
For BTC to reach parity with gold it'll need to be valued at over $600K a coin. It's coming....

Market Forces alone should determine CAP value, not a random valuation set by a cryptocoin's creator. A lot of noobs will be directed to this site and will be impressed with the Number 2 even though it has no credibility as a cryptocoin whatsoever. 
Before you know it rip off coin will be "ahead" of Bitcoin which would be yet more of a total nonsense. Most noobs won't even look at volume which is a shame.

1. True, there is no such thing, the author was trying to lay out a worse case scenario for mass-mining of Bitcoin.
2. True, again, it's a nearly impossible situation, again the author is stating the case FOR Bitcoin showing that under the worst circumstances it still does really well.
3. Because at 21 million coins that's it. No more can be produced.
4. Like the end of Silkroad? Like the meteoric rise of March and the equally rapid fall of April this year (caused merely by early adopters cashing out)? Those were predicted to cause Bitcoin to fail and it hasn't happened. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:48:35
Nope, I said it would be NICE if they dropped their fee. 0.5% or more per trade is awfully steep.
Other exchanges are charging a lot less.
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:46:52
It still ended up much higher than when the surge began. The rapid price drop was early adopters cashing our their newly made millions. After it bottomed at around 55US it then surged a little and stabilized around $125-$150US a coin. 5 times higher than when the original frenzy began.

What value does gold have? Gold is worth $200US an ounce in terms of its value in electronics, phones, industry etc. The balance of its current value is just goodwill and faith. $1040US of the value of gold is just the fact that people believe in it. 
Bitcoin is hovering around $775US per coin and will probably surpass gold pretty soon.
Mr. Schiff has a vested interest in keeping his advertisers happy. He has to talk gold up. If he's smart he's probably already snuck a few thousand bucks into Bitcoin. After all, why shouldn't he, who would know?

ok, so the price is plummeting...I enter an order to sell 5 btc on mtgox at spot. Immediately the price goes up by 7 bucks. I cancel the order. Immediately the price goes down BELOW what it was before I made the order. I repeat the exercise. Same result. WTF? Is mtgox feeding individual account holders different price data?
