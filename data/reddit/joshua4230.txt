i suppose so, it just feels like such an opportunity with the dip, I'd hate myself when bitcoin becomes the world currency and I missed the opportunity to get in relatively early

I actually mentioned this to her beforehand, after which she decided to offer $2000.  
  
Her refusal now is not that she cannot afford $2000, it's that she is convinced that bitcoin will crash just from a web article from a website she cannot recall
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:15:01
but it wont... right?

The article compared bitcoin to the economy of yap, where money is so big and heavy that it doesnt get moved; the money is all virtual. Transactions are announced at the town square and each household puts it in their own ledger record.
@_date: 2018-02-21 09:37:42
bad idea

Where everyone has an**even higher** quality of life.    
Just because it is the highest it has been doesnt mean it is the highest it *could* be

thank you for a serious response, it helped a lot

This guy was being a complete idiot and asshole but i *think* what he means is:  
There is a large wage gap between the top 0.01% and the majority of the population, and you could be making more if wage equality was achieved.  
  
But, you're not really a "slave" unless you literally live barely paycheck to paycheck and have no money or time for leisure activities, which is a minority of the total population
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:17:07
i dont think so, it was pretty legit, i amost vomited
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:20:06

We changed feudalism right?  
Anything is possible.  
The most important thing now, is *how* we change it
  
For example, totalitarian stalinism is definitely not the way
