\&gt; Ive worked for e-comerce companies and i can tell you...
Sure, online transactions are not yet performed with a cryptographic component like that, but there are various protection measures (CV2, AVS, VbV) which try to plug that gap. Not 100% there yet, but getting better.
\&gt; in the other hand yes now we have the contactless payments but in europe the credit cards falsifications still being millions Euros every year,
Not so much. Card-present transactions are very, very hard to fake these days, due to chip and pin or contactless. Only really an issue either online fraud (combatted by various VISA and Mastercard measures but still not perfect), or when someone takes your card details and tries to use it in a country that's well behind the times (USA mostly)
\&gt; small business still using chips.
Chips work the same way as contactless, more or less, so no key is revealed, the chip signs the transaction without revealing its keys.
That's all I wanted to say really - modern payment methods (chip, contactless, paypal, apple-pay, android pay etc) do much the same as BTC in the case you mentioned first, they perform transactions without revealing the secret.

\&gt;  In particular, Bitcoin provides security by design, for instance, unlike with credit cards you dont expose your secret (private key) whenever you make a transaction.
While there is some way to go with transactions over the internet, credit cards don't do this when you use chip and pin or contactless payments either. The card contains private keys and only hands over signed data for the transaction. The number alone gets you nowhere.
Unless you live in the US where people still use magnetic stripes of course. The rest of the world moved on 15 years ago.

PIN shouldn't be transmitted plain even on older models, that's just bad!
