How the heck do you even buy bitcoins? I started yesterday, began mining (I know, I know) and made a Mt. Gox account, but I'm a little spooked by the complexity of getting my money onto the site. I have to wire money from my bank to Japan, and upload a copy of my driver's license too? And then just sit around for 3 days hoping I did everything right and my money hasn't just disappeared...somebody please explain what is going on here.

Thank you very much! I'd tip you something but I only have about 5 cents' worth at the moment. So have an upvote instead!
EDIT: Followup question. Since BTC is currently dropping like a stone, would it be a good idea to think about actually buying some now/soon for when it bounces back?

Coinbase's buy limits work on a 24-hour rolling window.

Where do you check the live price of a bitcoin? I just got into this yesterday. Thanks!
And what's with this tip bot stuff? Are people just throwing money at each other?

Interesting...as a prospective BTC buyer, this volatility is dissuading me from buying. Coinbase (the easiest-to-set-up site I've found) won't actually give me my BTC for a few days after I send the purchase order, and in that time the price of a BTC could rise or drop by 25-50%. I want to buy in, but I won't touch until it evens out for a few days.

Thanks for the advice! If I decide to just buy some bitcoins, I'll definitely wait until the market is good and bottomed out before buying in. But the overarching message of mining seems to be that your returns will always be diminishing, so if you want to make money you need to start right away.

A bit of both. I think the concept of a decentralized digital currency is cool, but I also think the concept of getting paid for letting my computer run a program is cool as well. I'm a college student, so I don't have dreams of becoming a millionaire; recouping my initial costs and making any sort of profit off of this would be enough. You know, other than using my laptop on my university's power supply to make about 3 cents per day.

Yeah, I'm hoping the price drops a little further before the bubble bottoms out again. Seems to me that'll be the ideal time to jump in with a small investment.
