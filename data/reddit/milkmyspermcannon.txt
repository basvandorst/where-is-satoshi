the irony

I have friends that are essentially doing exactly what your 123 states. Pump BTC, buy futures, sell BTC. They don't have world influence like some of these hedge funds that can say "hey we bought BTC" and have the price go up, but they are very wealthy and seem to be 99% sure this will work.
It would make even more sense for wealthy bankers to do this. Not only do they reap the profits, but a significant BTC crash protects the image of their banks.

Very true. Money will fix all the problems that are money related, but guess what? Instead of worrying about paying rent or buying food you move onto the next thing to worry about. Things like your family's health or your own. Maybe now that you have money you finally have time to pursue your passion - except you've lost your passion along the way or you never had time to find it and now you're depressed.
It's kind of like maslow's hierarchy of needs. Money solves one rung on the ladder and then you move on to worrying about the next thing.

Big money could have pumped into the BTC market reaping the hype gains, then buy futures and sell all their BTC double dipping on profits. I know of someone planning to do exactly this. 
Hopefully for the people on this sub the people with 100's of billions/trillions aren't planning to do the same. Some of the banking behemoths would triple benefit from something like that. Profit on BTC sale, profit on futures, maintain their precious banks.

It seems when people say they bought X item with BTC they really mean that they sold BTC and bought X item with their profits from trading BTC, aka they used fiat. If I sell a stock I don't go around saying I went out to dinner and paid for my meal with TWTR stock. I can't think of many examples where someone actually used BTC to buy something meaningful like a car or house.
