Wow, so true. Reminds me when I wanted to take the plunge and buy bitcoin from my buddy. He wanted cash. No problem I thought, I have the cash in my bank. I mean, that's what it's indicating on my bank app -- the funds are there! Go to the bank. They didn't have it! It was well under 10K. They gave me what they could and I had to go to the ATM and maximize my daily withdraw limit then go back the NEXT day to get the rest of the cash I needed! Was it just my dumb luck or does this happen often??

Newbie here. So excited I got in to the BTC scene. Hello from CANADA! From what I'm reading, the BTC gains are similar to those of 2017 before the crash. I've already made some money like many people in a very short time and want to keep my gains. If/when BTC nosedives (short-term and long-term) and it's time to sell, what do you buy to keep your gains? Is that what the DAI coin or TETHER is for?
