100,000,000 Satoshi = full bitcoin = 1.00000000
100,000 Satoshi = millibitcoin = .00100000
100 Satoshi = bit = 0.00000100

Yup, but thats not the case. People want to buy green candles, they want to buy "winners".

Im not an expert but I imagine with how fast it is the steering is much like a F1 car meaning you never have to turn it more than 180 degrees. So hands on both sides and you can steer full left and full right without letting go. So no need for a circular wheel

Maybe a little if this attack continues

I love this guy, he's brilliant. I don't know what we'd do without him. He certainly deserves to be a millionaire if he isn't already
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:36:03
With all the shit that has been going on recently it looks like we're on track ��

Please we've been waiting for this for too long.
Can someone post a link for some memes we can download?

Im sure we've all seen that experiment where they let mcdonalds food sit to see how long it takes to mold. It'll probably be edible still in a few years ��
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:28:19
The meme support at 10k and 11k were weak af. 9k held up like a champ
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:58:19
Upvotes for everyone, let the memes roll in

Even if we had all 21 million Bitcoins right now and they're all available, thats actually a really small number. 
Try taking $21,000,000 and splitting it up for everyone in the world. Most people would get a couple pennies if they're lucky

Thats about when the bitcoin market cap matches gold too. I'd say thats about right
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:36:46
Whats with these bots everywhere?
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:56:42
$9,000 on GDAX, Congrats everyone
Edit: Thanks to the kind stranger who gifted me my very first gold. What a great day, and what great day for Bitcoin :')
Edit 2: Bots on every r/bitcoin post. You have been warned

Really scraping the bottom of the barrel with $32

If only people knew where his money actually came from. Dan Bilzerian is a fraud
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:56:09
Oh Im just giddy with excitement. Only $200 away

People on reddit tore EA a new asshole this week over battlefront. Their stocks down 2.5% today

Money can have some strange affects on the body
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:53:01
The math checks out, its possible. We're only about 1/6th the market cap of apple rn and a teeny tiny fraction of gold. Yes I know im not an expert but what im saying is that the possibility is there

really low stop losses?
@_date: 2017-04-16 04:24:10
Well maybe someone forgot, passed away, or lost access to account. Might be possible
@_date: 2017-04-16 04:27:41
Now that I really think about it this totally could happen, right??
@_date: 2017-04-22 06:48:11
I think bitcoin is still too volatile for gold investors. Even if they do buy/invest in cryptos I don't see them giving up their shiny precious metals that they physically own in exchange for it. I personally buy both though, idk

Solid dev team, roadmap looks fantastic, very undervalued imo
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:08:48
I like this idea too
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:07:18
Dont lose all your btc betting on alts either ��
@_date: 2017-05-14 23:57:51
That is true I am also very curious if that ever happens
@_date: 2018-04-14 02:03:02
Quite a bit more accurate actually
@_date: 2017-07-24 07:18:31
This deserves many gold stars
@_date: 2017-06-16 04:01:58
This needs more upvotes

As in one bitcoin will always be one bitcoin, it was a joke
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:42:15
If you want to maintain the same amount of bitcoin then hold bitcoin. If you want the same amount of usd then sell and hold usd
@_date: 2017-06-24 14:12:17
It holds its value in bitcoin very well
