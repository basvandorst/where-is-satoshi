They say get the coins out of exchanges. Where else is safer but the wallet that is your colon?

Not only that but if I ever f'd up that badly because of pure stupidity, the last thing I would do it go telling the world about it...

Why was Reddit your medium of choice to publicize this?

Yes, fraud prevention should be up to the individual. If the individual wants to become a collective than that's his right, but in the collective, he should lose none of his individual freedoms. Lots of fools made a lot of mistakes with a few mouse clicks and the news agencies jumped on it trying to push for skepticism and a cry for control which is the exact opposite of what the currency was created for. People are still stuck on antiquated ideas and don't know how to figure out whom to trust when. Let the idiots be idiots and squander their cash as they would like. This is true freedom at work!

basically we were going to give him a litmus test, but the paper turned blue as soon as we entered the thread for failing to meet even the most basic of ethos.

It's the constant influx of investments and sales that make bitcoin seem volatile. Stability in a more established money market is an illusion created by sheer volume of transactions, in the same vein that a cruise ship is more stable on the water than a yacht.

open source too! Pre-compiled versions or tainted compilers could compromise any piece of software, and paranoia isn't really a solution.

Are you saying we're unnatural?
BTW climate change is very real, and yes we caused it. It was probably going to happen one way or another, kind of like death, but we gave it an extra 100 million volt jump charge just to be sure.

If you've kept up with Bitcoin you'll know that the last month makes all data points and predictions irrelevant and makes the sources of such conjecture appear foolish.

fyi I'm watching it myself, and I never said it wasn't gonna happen.

Gonna be a mighty big grave, considering how many people have attached their lives to it.

Will do!

This is good, keep it coming.
