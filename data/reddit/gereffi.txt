You choose to live and earn money in the country that's taxing you.
@_date: 2014-01-29 01:29:45
You agree to it by living where you do.

You didn't sign anything, but there are documents that say that if you live here, you have to follow the rules. It's like if you walked into a store, and accidently broke something there. You would have to pay for it, even if you never agreed that you would pay for anything you damaged before going in.

A general framework is a good place to start.

I'm not sure if you're serious or not. Germany invading France is a perfect example of why we need government systems. The French would still be under German rule if it weren't for other countries having armies and being able to fight back against Germany. Do you really think that a group of people from all across Russia and the US would get together to stop the Germans if they didn't have a government system to tell them to do it? And even if they wanted to, it would take forever to get the infrastructure to design and create all of the weapons needed to fight. And even if that's done, we're going to be fighting with a militia rather than a standing army.
You're also going to cite the December Unrest, which is crazy. First of all, massive protests aren't going to work against people with no laws. If they're willing to rape and pillage one community, there's no reason that they won't just kill a group of protesters that come to their wall. The anarchy shown at these riots also resulted in the destruction of stores and public buildings. I don't want to live in a world where I'm afraid to own a business because people could come around and just burn my building down and not be punished for it.

Do you really think that you're as free as a slave just because you get taxed?
What's your solution? Do you want all roads to be private, schools only to be accessible by those wealthy enough to attend, no local, state, federal, or international protection forces, no libraries or fire departments, no regulations on the food you buy, no central source of currency, etc. etc.
You know what happens when a large piece of land goes unruled? Another group will come in to rule it. It could come from within, or it could be another country, but there will always be someone looking to rule. I'll agree that the American system of government isn't working the way I'd want it to right now, but the solution isn't to get rid of taxes.

I read the link that you posted before I responded. Now, can you actually answer my questions to you?
@_date: 2014-01-28 12:19:24
OK, let's say that it's immoral. I guess that's not too crazy to think.
Now, what's your solution?
@_date: 2014-01-29 14:35:47
I guess you could live on the ocean too. The fact is that if you live somewhere, you have to abide by all of the rules of that place. I don't get why that's so hard to understand.

Who's going to stop my community from killing all the men of your community, then looting your houses, raping your women, and enslaving your children?
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:03:25
I don't know. I think you could live in Antarctica if you want to.
You're acting like you just deserve a place to live where you don't have to pay taxes. The land in each country is owned by that country, and if you want to live there you have to follow the rules there.

If you're spending bitcoins, and then buying more bitcoins through your credit or debit card, why aren't you just just buying through your credit or debit card in the first place?
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:56:05
Is it really easier than Paypal? I mean, I get the other advantages that bitcoins have to offer, but what makes this process so much simpler than other alternatives?
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:50:37
How do you get bitcoins without a bank account or credit card though? I'm new at this and trying to figure things out.
@_date: 2013-12-10 10:50:10
OK, that makes some sense. But how is it better than using Paypal? I'd assume that most online stores that accept bitcoin also accept Paypal. I've been interested in bitcoins for a little while now, but I just haven't really seen any reasons to use them quite yet.

You really think that 100 out of 100 people consider chess a sport? 
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:58:24
It's significantly more than zero effort for people who don't know about bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:00:02
Chess is not a physical activity, so it's not a sport. It's just a game. Just because it's a game doesn't mean that it can't be just as  enjoyable or fulfilling than a sport, but calling it a sport is crazy.
