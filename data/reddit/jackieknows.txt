Be more than carefull to try to Import the wallet.dat in the bitcoin qt on an online(maybe infected) computer.
Would be better to get the private keys out of the wallet.dat offline and import them in electrum for example. Then send them over to a Trezor. 
So if this really is no joke post i am sure you know you really don't wanne f*** up this process ;)

There is something called proof of work that protects the transactions in the blockchain  
So it's impossible to fake a transaction in the Bitcoin network. And also nobody can create new bitcoins other than in the process of mining, so you need big big amounts of Computer power with Special Asic Miners to have the Chance to create new bitcoins. It's really complex but interesting to deep dive and learn about how it all works.
edit: and basicly it's how the BitcoinNetwork works, See it like a big ledger with all transactions in it, that is shared and updated constantly between all participating entities, so all the time everyone sees every transaction and the Network can be sure who owns what amount of bitcoins.

What makes the company unique is that the records are maintained digitally, through a technology system called a blockchain (Bitcoin uses a similar technology) that cannot be tampered with.

Which blockchain do you expect to build on?
Today Bitcoin has the most momentum of any blockchain in the market. The Ethereum project and other new blockchains and sidechains optimized for deed of property applications could also be viable candidates.
So they will propably use the Bitcoin blockchain

Chronicled Faq:
In technical terms how does authenticity verification work?
A sneaker (or any physical asset) contains a PKI chip (NFC or BLE), which hosts a private key that cannot be read. The correspondent public key of the chip is stored in our registry. Verification happens with a mobile device scanning the chip. Using NFC or BLE protocols, the mobile sends a random string, which is signed by the chip on the sneaker using the private key. The signed string is sent back to the mobile which validates it against the public key in the registry.

So this is what i learned by searching for HD Wallet:
 
HD = hierarchical deterministic
**Deterministic wallet**
A deterministic wallet is a system of deriving keys from a single starting point known as a seed. The seed allows a user to easily back up and restore a wallet without needing any other information and can in some cases allow the creation of public addresses without the knowledge of the private key.

“Trust does not depend on excluding bad actors, as they cannot ‘fake’ trust. They cannot pretend to be the trusted party, as there is none. They cannot steal the central keys as there are none. They cannot pull the levers of control at the core of the system, as there is no core and no levers of control.”

Coinbase is holding your public key and also the bitcoins connected to that key. 
And the wallet.dat just stores your public keys inside and is only used by the Bitcoin qt Client. So coinbase doesn't store your public keys in such file.
As long as you (and in the best case no one else) have copies of your private key(s) in whatever Format: paperwallet(keys written down, printed on paper), hardware wallet(like the trezor), usb stick backup, that means the bitcoins connected to that key belong to you.

my prediction is, no one has a fu**n clue what the price will do, but i am really curious what the bitcoin future will bring :)
You can try to predict "logicly" like, the price has to crash down near to $0 or else it will rise to the moon. There can´t be something in between. Or you can say it has to reach back to the $1200 that we saw before. But if you´re honest you have do admit that no one really knows for sure what will happen or if the prices of bitcoin will rise, otherwise this person would try to buy the hell out of bitcoins.
But anyway, my guess is we will see much higher prices and i think it´s a damn smart move to put some coins (bought with as much money as you couid afford to lose) in cold storage and wait for a bright cryptomoney future, the signs for Bitcoins Rise and Rise are good.

Policy change announcement: We support the hard fork effort to increase the max block size to 2MB. Seg-wit may be deployed together in this hard fork if it can be ready in time, or it can be merged later. Non-controversial features in the hard fork wishlist, if it does not delay the hard fork process, can be deployed at the same time. The hard fork should be implemented in Core, eventually. “Bitcoin” Classic, which despite was born on the same day that XT dies, is an attempt that could make the hard fork happen sooner. We welcome Classic. We are going to cease support for FSS-RBF after upgrading to version 0.12, some time in the next few weeks. We may not implement the opt-in RBF feature. We believe that we should do everything we can do to make 0-conf transactions as secure as possible. We do not believe the concept of fee market."

Do you buy more?
Do you sell?
does the price will drop until blocksize fork is solved?
would like to hear your guess 
@_date: 2016-01-18 19:09:51
They also would be safe on the ledger! 
When you buy and store your bitcoins before a fork they will be safe, you just have to be carefull after a fork has been done, cause then there could exist two chains for some time.
Or put some more money in and buy a trezor, it's even more secure and even has a display. 
I love mine
edit: just saw you already have a ledger wallet. Thought you were searching for a hardware wallet.

Without some greed the blockchain wouldn't work, the miners need to be able to sell the coinsthey worked for, to pay for electricity, Hardware and more. Without an incentive the whole system wouldn't be able to stay alive.

@_date: 2015-08-10 22:05:33
Yes correct, maybe the explanation from the bitcoin-wiki helps, i don't think there is a very easy answer to that question. Basically the miners are searching for the correct Nonce for the Hash of all previous transactions (correct me if i am wrong)
What is a Nonce?:
,,The "nonce" in a bitcoin block is a 32-bit (4-byte) field whose value is set so that the hash of the block will contain a run of zeros. The rest of the fields may not be changed, as they have a defined meaning.
Any change to the block data (such as the nonce) will make the block hash completely different. Since it is believed infeasible to predict which combination of bits will result in the right hash, many different nonce values are tried, and the hash is recomputed for each value until a hash containing the required number of zero bits is found. As this iterative calculation requires time and resources, the presentation of the block with the correct nonce value constitutes proof of work.''

From another Post:
The number looks like "M12335678X" (in my case 8 digits) it was shown top right when you logged in. You also needed this as a description when wiring fiat funds to Mtgox. So if you wired funds, you can check your bank statements to find your gox account number.
The financial institution registered with MtGox is the bank account you had verified with MtGox. This of course only applies to people who withdrew fiat.

The Letter:
Dear Porcfest,￼I am writing to you from my cell in New York City. Sorry I couldn’t make it this year. Unfortunately the worst case scenario has played out for me and I’ve been sentenced to spend the rest of my life in prison. I am an eternal optimist though and will never give up hope for my release. I have confidence that the appeals court will recognize the errors by some and outright corruption by others in the government and give me some sort of remedy. It could be a new trial, where hopefully the whole story can be told or the case could be dismissed altogether.
In many ways, my struggle is just getting started now that it’s going to the higher courts, so I still need your help. Mounting an effective appeal is not easy. I’m confident in my team, but there’s only so much we can do without your donations. What we can be sure of is that the government will spend as many of your tax dollars as needed to keep me behind bars, so please help however you can.
I hope my story has shed light on some of the issues we face these days. There are many, but please don’t let what’s happened to me lead you to despair. Keep standing for liberty and respect for our rights. Keep fighting for your freedom and evenutally we will win.

**The challenge**
There’s a lot of buzz around blockchain. It’s a technology that allows people who don’t know each other to trust a shared record of events. And its potential won’t just impact financial services. Many believe that blockchain could track and verify almost any digital record.
**A host of possibilities**
Blockchain’s distributed ledger technology already maintains the Bitcoin network, and keeps a record of all Bitcoin transactions. It’s underpinning a new land title registry system in Honduras so people can prove they own the land they’ve bought. It’s enabling universities to store and encrypt student qualification records so employers can instantly verify CVs. It’s helping insurance companies crack down on fraud and theft by giving diamonds a digital fingerprint, creating a public ledger that tracks the origin, sale and ownership of the world’s most precious stones.
And many more novel applications are bubbling under. From how we identify individuals or verify the provenance of organic goods, to managing car leases or decentralising crowdfunding services.
The point is that while the technology might include some risks, there are all sorts of far-sighted, game-changing, life-enhancing ideas to pursue. We want to hear about yours."

2nd part (i realized i could connect my bluetoothkeyboard with my iPad:D)
It´s thursday, September, 25 2040. 7:00 o´clock. Everything is spinning, my head is buzzing, My bedroom. This is good: at least no complete failure. Maybe i shouldnt have partied my 45th birthday like it was my 20th. ,, Good Morning, i hope you slept well well" greets me my personal assistant. ,,Counting frm yesterday says you drank eight tequila, five beer and two appletini. Should i order you aspirine?" I mumble a short ,,yes" and pull my blanket over my head - to many details. I hope the delivery drone finds my adress at first attempt and will be here in the next 25 minutes.
,,There´s a problem with the transaction, Maik", bothers the assistent. ,, Your credit limit is exhausted. I choose an alternative payment methode for you." We live in the year 2040, i think to myself - and there are still problems qith the beloved money. What could have charged my account? ,,Show me the las account-changes". i say and grab for the display. Who would have thought, smartphone would change to a glas panel, that shows all the content context-sensitive. Now the transactions of the last days are displayed on the surface. If i would have liked, i could search trough the last ten years in details. That was different in the past: you had to let print out a bank statement. On paper! Crazy, how careless we handled our resources in the past.

Peter Todd, a core Bitcoin developer, said the “proof” was “like photocopying someone else’s signature on a publicly available document and claiming it’s proof you are them”. “Because the proof provided is non-existent, and Craig has a history of scams, this could simply be part of a bigger scam.”
Todd said there were also doubts around whether Wright had proven he had the original keys by signing block number 1. Block  not block  is the true “genesis block”. Wright may need to use a private key that signed a transaction in the original block to support his claims. “Block  was mined a few hours after Bitcoin was announced publicly, so anyone who downloaded the software could have mined it.”

It begins with:
LIKE KRYPTONITE FOR CAPITAL
Since the big hype 2013 Bitcoin lost more then 2/3 of it's value. Though that didn't hurt the digital money very much: the interest is rising rapidly. Because meanwhile it shows, what the strengths of the digital currency and the underliying Blockchain-Technology are. This opens up opportunities for all, whose everyday life is unseparable connected to the Net - and beyond.

Hey, liked your post, if you want to get a good solution for long term storage get yourself a Hardware Wallet. 
TREZOR and Ledger Nano S are the most common ones. Both are great devices.
Once you buy your first pieces of a Bitcoin you never go back ;)
