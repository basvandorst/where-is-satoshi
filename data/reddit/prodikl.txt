Shit speaking of which, I didn't even catch the Libertarian party debates. I voted Gary Johnson in 2012, here's hoping the LP gets more traction this year!

can anyone TIL why the fee was so high? i have all my digital currency in coinbase, too. i thought BTC was free to transfer?

yeah i don't really understand that either. i guess the value is inflated because there's not only the current global market value of BTC but also the premium they're willing to pay since USD is so rare there and the local fiat is a hot mess.
so i think basically, you could sell USD for more than its worth there because its rare? maybe it has something to with this part

Got excited when it was around there, wife and i decided to start sending 200 of our monthly 1000 we send to betterment, to bitcoin. 
We're down a bit...
That said, now it's discounted so it's the best time to buy!

It's a risk that I didn't think was worth, either. Don't get yourself down, though. There are other virtual currencies that have failed. There's no way you could have foreseen it catching on and any sane financial investor would probably have suggested against investing in it
