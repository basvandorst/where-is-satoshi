How about this, can you grant the point that there are a *lot* fewer people browsing than there were 9 months ago? Not just a little bit less traffic, a *lot*
November 2013	1,232,029
vs 
August 2014 564,565
More than *half* of traffic to has left since the peak. Traffic to has been dropping for virtually every month since february. 
I am having a hard time understanding how disregarding data *over* the past year strengthens your core argument that bitcoin and are growing and "the users are growing and with growth comes more vocal morons". 
What person would like at this graph ( and argue "this graph shows growth over the past year". 
There are a lot of arguments a person could make about why bitcoin is will succeed, but usage on over the past year isn't one of them.

The price will go up by precisely 832 in 9 days. It will drop to 435 in 12 hours. 
You are Welcome.

no, there are a lot fewer people browsing than there were a year ago.

your comment said "it's obvious there are more posters and comments now than there was a year ago". 
how exactly is that obvious? Are you saying that the 80K difference in uniques between 564K and 684K is all "vocal morons"? 
The traffic graph makes it seem like users and price are correlated, and as the price has dropped so has the number of people on By what other metric are users growing over the past year? Transactions per day growth looks anemic: 
The only important metric I can think of that is obviously and reliably growing is hashrate

private mercenaries with a drone army who were hired by decentralized autonomous corporations, thats who. we're entering the post-government phase of history. the almighty bitcoin is our government. all matters of government, including voting, will be done with bitcoin. he who hold the bitcoin holds the power. 
when mt gox price goes to 100,000,000,000,000,000, all of the holders of bitcoin will be kings in the new world order. all of the kids that bullied and friendzoned us in high school will be bowing at our feet for a single satoshi. we are the chosen, the enlightened cyberpunks. I am cyberpunking so hard right now it hurts.

If you look at his comments on bitcointalk, his English is incredibly good, even in a less formal context:
It's interesting that his bitcointalk user_id is 3, and there aren't any posts for bitcointalk user_id 1 or 2. I don't know the backstory here, who announced and operated bitcointalk in the 2009 era?

so true... bitcoin speculators really are the greatest heroes of our generation. 
Just think: if all of the older generations where heroes had to build products and companies in order to get rich. Those poor suckers didn't have amazing power of getting stinking rich off currency speculation, too bad for them!
Your post makes me really excited about the future! The old generation had boring old Steve Jobs and this generation has talented geniuses like the Winkelvoss twins! Who needs to work when you got bitcoin! TO THE MOON!!!!!!!!
