This is all coming from my friend who is a graduate student in neurochemical dependencies. I'm going to trust him over some random person on the internet.


Addiction is addiction. Doesn't mean that a gambling addict is just as addicted as a heroin addict.

Opponent has argument X.
You create aargument Y, a distorted version of X.
You attack Y. 
This is a strawman.

Because one is a psychological addiction that can be treated with behavioral therapy and light medication. The other is a *full-blown neurological dependence upon a foreign substance*. They are VASTLY different. It doesn't matter if the same regions of the brain light up. That DOES NOT imply that they are the same. Seriously. Go to any psychologist and tell them that heroin dependence and gambling are almost the same thing. They will laugh in your face.
And you're right, it's less of a strawman and more of a false equivocation.

It may be the same area, but to compare a mostly psychological addiction to an ACTUAL chemical dependence (heroin is one of the most addictive substances known to man) is completely fallacious. A false equivocation, to be precise.

That is bullshit. I've had nicotine poisoning three times and have never been addicted to it. Also, any heroin addict that quits cold turkey will go through severe withdrawal symptoms. Many cigarette users have up and quit with no problem whatsoever. You are spouting anti-tobacco propaganda that isn't based in science.
I recommend you posing your query to about the addictiveness of heroin vs nicotine to alleviate your misconceptions.
