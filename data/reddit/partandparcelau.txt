I'm on no side but the side of profit like every other person here. I've been in the cryptocurrency scene since 2012. The only thing that matters are the number of zeros in my bank account so that i can buy more property to rent it out to people who can't afford property. Earn more rental income and equity to buy more property and more crypto for more profit. That's all that matters in life. How well off are you compared to everyone else? Cause when you're above the masses in terms of networth it doesn't matter what the federal bank does and What new decentralized technology spawns from this scene. What matters is the your life has no hardship because you make money while you sleep. You make your life easier, you make your family happier and you have enough "fuck you" money to not be scared for the future. I've reached that status. Have you?

Lol shit coins. Such a fucking pleb. Bitcoin maximilists like you are fucking retarded. Everyone's in it for the money. Don't fucking act like you're some  anti government and anti federal reserve anarchist when you exchange your bitcoins for fiat for profit like the rest of us. If an alt coin is gonna give me x50-100 return compared to bitcoin which in the last 12 months like it has. I don't give a fuck if it's a shit coin. Cunts like you are the same as the dinosaurs who only invest into blue chip stocks and ETFs for a 5 to 10 percent ROI and too fucking stubborn move to other avenues of investment

5 properties bought with bitcoin by cashing it out slowly. In terms of valuation of my portfolio it would be 75% property, 20% altcoins and 5% liquidity

Bro who fucking cares. They'll never know how much you're holding even if you had an electrum wallet.
