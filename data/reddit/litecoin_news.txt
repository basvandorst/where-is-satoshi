Try (6 / 36^6) 
6 digits total in 21e800, you're trying to argue the 00 was not significant while it is literally the most significant part of this hash...

It is also .21e8  
The decimal CAN be anywhere, do you think an AI would ONLY follow "traditional" scientific notation?  
.21e8 is still accepted Scientific Notation, according to Wikipedia...  
Try again?

You are incorrect, each digit consists of 62 possible characters, it is alpha-numeric CASE SENSITIVE, please get your math correct...   
The likelihood of any hash beginning with "21e800" is approximately 1 in 56.8 BILLION  
62 \* 62 \* 62 \* 62 \* 62 \* 62 = 56,800,235,584 possible combinations...  
Given there is a block hash every 10 minutes, theoretically if this was all random, it would have taken approximately 57 Billion Bitcoin Blocks for it to "randomly" reference itself, and that is only presuming that ONLY the 21e800 is "intentional"...   
57 Billion X 10 minutes = 570 Billion Minutes = 9.5 Billion Hours = 394.5 Million Days = 1 Million &amp; 80,000 Years before this "self-referential" hash should have shown itself... But it did it in 10 years... TEN YEARS  
The odds that it showed itself THAT EARLY, only ten years after the Genesis Block, 1,079,990 Years Early...  
The odds of THAT are approximately 1 in 110,000...  
If you believe ANY digits following that have intentional "meaning", than those odds become astronomical...

What is 62 to the power of 6?  
That's how many blocks should have been produced before this specific hash ever "appeared"...

Okay, so you're right...
I just learned what a hexadecimal is...
You are 100% correct on the 3% chance of "21e800" occurring when it did...
The math corrected me...
If you factor that with the "c1e8" addendum, the odds increase to 1 in 1.1 Trillion that it referenced itself with this hash, this early...
It goes deep, this rabbit hole...

LOL, thanks for the laugh mate :)  
Had to look up the clip, WORTH!

Maybe we should broadcast it to Earth first, baby steps right?  
All this searching for "Extraterrestrial" life and we didn't even thoroughly search the "terrestria" first before going extra...  
The people who dream with eyes wide open are the one's changing the world everyday, please don't belittle my dreams, for they are mine and mine alone, I did nothing to you but provide you information out of the kindness of my heart for you to discern at will...  
Peace be with you!

Your argument is null-set, we are already 90% digital for all fiat...
For every 10 digital USD there us only 1 bill physically existing...
We're already at that point, that's am argument of infrastructure, not Bitcoin...

That was a leading question, which is the furthest thing from a simple question...  
To answer your question, I probably wouldn't have noticed meaning in your shown hash above due to the fact that it's composed primarily of data that's referencing us humans, the entire intriguing part of this hash from the beginning was that it was Bitcoin "referencing itself", and you left those data points out "21e800" that are so crucial to it referencing itself...  
21 = 21 million  
.21e8 = Total Bitcoin
21e800 = Extra Two 0's, similar to the Genesis Block

Thank you for speaking your mind and not letting the trolls do your thinking, gives me hope for this whole situation...

I corrected the sats to BTC, but .21e8 is still 21 million, therefore a self reference...
Wikipedia article clearly states there are loose rules for exponential notation, please do your research and read the full wikipedia page...

Forgive my laziness, but I won't even try calculations that big right now...
21e8 is significant in this hash due to it's isolation in front of two zeroes, it "caught" people's attention due to the low probability and the fact that it reminds of the Genesis Block which was presumably mined at two magnitudes of difficulty higher than necessary, thus creating two extra zeros...
Mining for the 21e800 hash today would require another 2x magnitude more difficulty needed, resulting in high power or time costs, impossibly high...

Well fuck...
I need to do some math, brb...
