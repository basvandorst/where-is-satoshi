iOS wallet wasn't updated in years... probably because of Apple policies.

a) many blocked TOR, meaning you couldn't preserve your privacy and use your web wallet 
b) BC.I has by far the most users, so statistical probabilities..

A site owned by anonymous people, maintained by other wallet developers, and financially supported by the Bitcoin Foundation (of which BC.I is not a member) pulls BC.I in a witch hunt despite their being no standards and no other wallet pulled for user error. Typical.

yeah, using a nice old codebase full of buggy errors with only manual backups most be fun. lulz.

this is not true in the case of other online wallets like hive, breadwallet, and yes, blockchain.info
coinbase also reserves the right, in the TOS, to freeze your accounts until you verify your identity and prove you are not breaking the law. they do this routinely, there are plenty of accounts of it.
*edit: this= coblee's statement that any online wallet can see all the coins you received and sent

most didn't, if you look at the posts they are mostly reposts from 6-18 months ago.

yet more FUD from btcdrak... and his mysterious developer circles

The Blockchain wallet has a nice merchant app that is built in. I believe that also manually verify each entry.

It is now insecure? what's your source? 
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:33:00
Coinbase is great if you want to get Gox'ed, have your details leaked to the internet (already happened), your account frozen till you submit your ID/address (happening) and every transaction monitored

if you look at the commit it was a fallback.. 
do you have an example of a breech made using via a fallback socket that transmitted the encrypted data (encryption is done locally with bc.i) ?
..would be very interesting to see examples of an incidence, since there are many of users error such as teamview (of which the most recent example in r/bitcoin is from a bitcoin-qt user)
