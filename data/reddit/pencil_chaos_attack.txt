Love the sarcasm here!

I'm not going to continue to argue the effects of deflation.  Read about deflation during the great depression, and I challenge you to find an econometric study that shows mass deflation is actually a good thing.  The point of this post was to ask how the limited supply of bitcoin won't lead to deflation, but it seems people are conceding the idea that it will lead to deflation.

But why will the company invest in higher quality products if their return on that investment will be lower than the rate of deflation? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:53:44
what makes you think it will reach 1m a coin?

How will a fixed supply of money not lead to massive deflation?
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:02:27
You don't get it.  The net profit margin on those sales would have to be higher than the rate of deflation.  That won't be the case when we are experiencing deflation over 10%.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:36:24
Do you know what inflation and deflation are?
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:17:48
I'm 100% lost.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:15:04
Why do you think it would become less volatile.  Once all the bitcoins are mined deflation could only get worse and worse 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:57:50
Explain how deflation will incentive business to produce goods of higher quality.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:08:41
You are just wrong.  Why would any firm investment money in a factory when the rate of return on that investment is lower than the rate of deflation.  The firm would be better off to put the money under a mattress.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:07:58
well you said invest using fiat.

Growth can last forever.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:24:42
So how can this be an investment if you have no way to determine when it is over or under valued?
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:10:44
Well lets get back to the point.  If there is a limit on the number of bitcoins at some point we will experience severe deflation.  this discourages investment.  In any economy, how is this a good thing?
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:37:19
If the deflation rate is even 5% that would discourage a ton of investment.  At 15% there would be virtually no reason to invest.  And if the supply is fixed the deflation rate will only get higher.  Many business make around 10% net income, so at a 10% rate of deflation there is very little reason to make any business investments.

You still aren't getting at my main point.  Even with millions of users a currency that does not grow with economic growth will be deflationary and thus won't be a currency that is viable for widespread use.   The big swings that we are seeing now have to do with demand.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:49:41
let me explain.
A company invests $100 into a product.  the product takes year to be produced.  at the end of the year they sell it for $120. If the currency was stable this would represent a profit of close to $20 (say $19.80 under normal inflation).
If the value of the currency was appreciating rapidly it could look like this
A company invests $100 into a product.  the product takes year to be produced.  at the end of the year they sell it for $120. In the course of the year because of deflation, the $100 now has the same purchasing power as $120.  Therefore the company took the risk of producing a product but their profit is wiped out by changes in the value of the currency.  Just as high inflation can affect the markets ability to act efficiently, so can crazy deflation.
And yes I am scared of the change, I find it scary that people who don't understand monetary policy are putting money into a currency that has a fixed supply.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:30:10
If a currency is going up in value drastically that discourages people from making investments.  Why would I risk money in an investment when the return on that investment will be less than the return on just holding money.

Debt is necessary for economies... I don't understand what you mean.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:09:19
You don't understand macroeconomics... theres no reason to even discuss this with you.  There is plenty of evidence about the effects on deflation on economies...  Almost every person on here has tried to tell me that runaway deflation is good.  I challenge you to find one economist who will agree with that statement.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:51:25
Instead of bringing up 10 other issues, explain how going from a system of 2% inflation to mass deflation will be better for economic growth. Offer up a single piece of evidence. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:25:54
I did but I misunderstood, my bad.  theres so many people here saying deflation is a good thing. i read your post too fast. apologies.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:47:11
In the abscess of utility what value is scarcity?  There are plenty of things that are scarce, that does not make them valuable.

How will it be more stable than USD when the money supply of bitcoin is fixed?
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:15:27
I haven't seen any evidence for the actual existence of giffen goods. They exist only in theory.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:38:20
So you put money in bitcoin only to transfer it to a fiat currency when you are going to use it?
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:13:38
small amounts of inflation or deflation aren't a big problem... its when you have 10% a year.  Since bitcoin has a fixed supply theres no reason to believe it won't lead to 10, 20 30, or even 100% deflation
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:34:42
you still haven't answered me this.  How is the bitcoin price ever going to be stable enough for everyday use when there is a limit on the number of coins.  This is the one question no bitcoin investor has been able to answer for me.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:37:09
True, but then you would admit its simply gambling?
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:05:50
It also discourages investments in technologies that allow us to use our resources more efficiently.
