Oh yes, I fully agree. These are serious concerns that the BTC community needs to address.

Maybe when Bitcoin goes over $100,000. Does that answer help?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:14:46
Excuse me, IMHO, but doesn't a market cap of $171bn make Bitcoin one of the biggest financial entities on the planet? Just asking.

Just imagine the difficulty for the banker who reaches a decision by morning, after a sleepless night: "Yes, definitely we should buy Bitcoin". He or she goes into the office and instructs a junior banker "Buy Bitcoin". The junior banker goes away and comes back 3 hours later: "Which one? Bitcoin? Bitcoin Cash? Or Bitcoin Gold?"...."Oh shit!"

I hold BTC and I categorically do NOT want to overthrow "the government". I do NOT want to give governments the pretext of over-regulating Bitcoin in the name of combating subversion. A useful lesson: when you take on "the government" you usually lose big time. Let's keep Bitcoin for what it is: an amazing economic and holistic phenomenon that is going to change the world, but NOT a competitor to law or government.

6 mos.....or 6 weeks?

Very interesting points. Very interesting. You have obviously thought very deeply about these matters. I agree that it is right to be concerned about possible, adverse, future eventualities; and to prepare against them.

I think there will be a lot of holding. IMHO $10K will subsequently be seen as an early starting point value of BTC

This is a fun game to play. I didn't have a clue that Bitcoin would go up by $1,453 in 56 hours over the weekend just gone. So....in a year......$100,000? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:50:38
I think they are already: Santander, Amex and others I can't remember
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:18:38
You talking to the Free Market?

And where will you put the fiat currency? It won't be secure in the globalised, fiat, banking system. How about into crypto? Which one? Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:18:45
Any geopolitical, cataclysmic event would spook fiat like nobody's ever seen. And what would fiat wealth holders do? They'd stampede into Bitcoin so fast that people would get trampled in the crush. A cataclysmic event is likely to create Bitcoin on steroids!

His wife will look happier when he gets her a Bitcoin necklace for their anniversary

Why is a 6 month foetus in the womb NOT the baby the parents wanted to see? Because it's still going through necessary stages of development. It will come out when its ready!

Brilliant! I like it!

Unfair to Judas. Judas, at least, was tying to help even though he got it wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:29:42
Ha! Ha! Perhaps just keep a little in reserve? Just in case?
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:04:47
I think you've highlighted a very important issue, which is a very significant concern at this time when mainstream financial institutions are starting to come on board with Bitcoin. However, Bitcoin got to where it is now by pure, free-market economics. But happens from here on, no one knows.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:47:15
Well done. Good decision. Nice work

Just to the Moon? Not further? Mars? Jupiter? Neptune?

That's a brilliant summary of the bad side of human nature; and of the vulnerability of the crypto world to the bad side of human nature; and a brilliant summary of the global financial system. It's worthy of the great philosophers! Very nice one!
