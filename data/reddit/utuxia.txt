amen brother. remember "its an experiment"


you can tell a professional product from an amateur one right away. Bitcoin is very amateurish.
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:13:57
that client is probably the worst piece of software i've ever used.
@_date: 2015-06-12 00:06:09
Yeah. and nobody does war driving either.
@_date: 2015-06-11 08:27:48
On which fork?
@_date: 2015-06-06 23:39:16
What I really want is for a secure online wallet where I can restore my wallet on another service if the one I'm using goes down.
I *should* be able to open my wallet with any software I want, regardless of where or when I created the original.
Electrum is pretty decent this way, except I don't think I can restore my electrum wallet with any other wallet service or software. This should be a standard that all wallets support.
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:35:44

Yeah. seriously. "Oh just upload your confidential identity via these insecure methods." -- almost every post I've read about DropBox says its not secure. I would reply "send me your GPG"

@_date: 2015-06-26 00:38:08
I don't know what to tell you. I wouldn't sell my dog. God only knows what they would do with it. But if I needed the money I might consider it. Maybe you can find a look-alike on craigslist....and sell him that one.

Coinbase sucks. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 08:19:05
paper money. dollars, etc. government issued money backed by nothing is called 'fiat'.
What I'm saying is try to leverage Bitcoin to give you an advantage over people still using fiat. By accepting Bitcoin online you immediately open up yourself to global commerce w/o fees from a 3rd party payment processor.

haha. Bitcoin has a very real and practical application. But I don't think the price will go up much.
1 year.
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:53:59
I'm waiting to buy at $174. Soon my friend....soon.
@_date: 2015-06-10 04:07:42
Not I, but I'm sure somebody else around here would.
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:03:50
all i can say is the first time my web site got hacked back in the 90s someone defaced the site with a "Free Kevin Mitnick" banner. I had no idea who or what that was.
@_date: 2015-06-21 04:00:41
I'm going to use stripe so I can accept Bitcoin and credit cards.
Otherwise I would use block.io for pure crypto. But their tools are not that developed yet. Stripe seems dead simple to implement.

Did that movie ever get released?
@_date: 2015-06-07 04:31:26
It's happened before. Just goes to show it is not very reliable.
@_date: 2015-06-07 23:36:50
Yeah....but the distinction here is I thought only the address that was identified could be tracked, now I see that if 1 address in my wallet is known all transactions in the wallet can be known.
@_date: 2015-06-05 07:36:42
I'm pissed because I downloaded that POS wallet and it just overheated my computer. That was 4 years ago.
@_date: 2015-06-07 09:32:49
just spend it. I'm not "cashing out". I still want to see what happens in 5-10 years, but it seems to me that something better will come along...and it will be worthless. I didn't put much in, so I'm not going to suffer much if it crashes.
I do find the idea and the technology (although poorly implemented) has merit.
@_date: 2015-06-02 09:18:40
Shit my pants? That's what I'll have to do when they decide?
@_date: 2015-06-11 08:15:19
Exactly. It's going to get shut down if there is a company behind it. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 04:23:10
I believe there are already a few bitcoin lending platforms out there. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 05:34:56
Because it's not Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:19:42
i don't know. these bitcoin devs strike me as people who have never written software professionally. Do we have to make the same mistakes over and over again? All software should be auto updating seemless to the user.
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:55:23
Except all this fork nonsense....driving people away probably as they think their coins will be worthless.
@_date: 2015-06-03 15:27:22
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:17:38
Wow, you guys sure did manage to fuck things up pretty good.
@_date: 2015-06-10 06:28:24
So what your are saying is my net worth (in Bitcoin) will effectively double and I'd be able to spend both versions?
Sound money! We can just print more!!
Honestly, I don't know why everyone isn't using it now. This should cause a price spike if nothing else.
@_date: 2015-06-04 04:31:00
funny, a year ago it took me 2 weeks to download at 40Mbps and I just gave up after my mac started to overheat. So [pardon me if](

@_date: 2015-06-21 07:55:12
i haven't noticed any.
@_date: 2015-06-07 04:29:59
I stopped buying Bitcoin about 2 years ago. It's been pretty clear there is no real leadership and no companies providing much needed funding.

He said there are 5M users now and if you include the 36M millenials who plan on using it is an 800% increase.
@_date: 2015-06-05 07:59:24
I would have definitely put $1k into it back in the day just on a long shot (if I knew what I know now about bitcoin).
Now, I'm still forward thinking, but I can't justify putting my life savings into such a poorly run software project.
I'll put $50-100/month into now if there's a big dip.

I just watched the movie "[Deep Web]( and was a little surprised when they discussed their defense about the possibility of a 2nd or 3rd DPR who framed him, they didn't explain why Ross was caught red handed with all that incriminating evidence on his laptop....if he supposedly "wasn't involved anymore"...what was he doing logging in to the SR admin interface from a library and the entire history + journal of his adventures running SR on the laptop?
They claim in the movie "He was framed, that evidence was planted there..." but I find it hard to believe how that would even be possible.

I don't see it as a loss. I could hold, but there's no gaurantee it'll go up. I spend it when I need to spend it and replace it as soon as I spend it.
@_date: 2015-06-13 04:13:18
I see. This would kick off some Bitcoin users...for sure. I tried paying my guy in Bitcoin but he didn't know how to convert back to local currency, so we went back to UpWork. I can't use that site anymore. It's terrible.
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:52:42
@_date: 2015-06-06 05:51:04
The guy met somewhere random and got inside the car of the buyer? Damn. That sucks he got robbed, but are you kidding me? You go get in a car with someone you never met off craigslist? Especially when doing a financial transaction. Have a little brains.
@_date: 2015-06-04 03:26:49

Yes, yes, he *says* he'll never do that...
@_date: 2015-06-04 04:32:03
at least take the average for the past week. I guess he's trying to avoid where the transaction doubles in a day and it's not big enough.
saturday/sunday i would imagine it be lower.
@_date: 2015-06-02 09:41:52
What if I don't upgrade my software?

Bullshit. it will be chaos and anarchy and you are so stupid you think you'll have an internet connection still.
@_date: 2015-06-07 00:17:49


I like that. I bought some at the ATH....including all the way up and all the way back down. In 10 years, today's ATH will look tiny.....we hope.
Now I only buy in the big dips. I did recently hire someone and start to pay them in Bitcoin. If this works out well then I may have to buy more Bitcoin as I needed to cover payments to employees.

so you're effectively telling everyone near you "Come Rob Me!"
@_date: 2015-06-07 09:36:00
Yes, bitpay is the one exception that has contributed high quality open source software. We'll see what this BlockStream gives us. I stopped believing all that horseshit about "wallstreet is coming". Clearly they aren't.

That's the one. So it's not very reliable or it is reliable? I have generally understood that wallets were private and couldn't be linked to it's addresses. I guess that is incorrect.
@_date: 2015-06-08 23:25:16
seriously. 15 years and "bubble" -- that's not a bubble. It's *supposed* to go up over time.
@_date: 2015-06-10 06:19:59
So what exactly is a "teller" in this context?
@_date: 2015-06-10 06:24:36
I will probably just send them all to coinbase before the fork until this mess is figured out....then transfer them back to wherever they belong.
@_date: 2015-06-13 22:07:29
Yeah. I'm trying a few different people. It also helps to streamline the process when you have input from multiple people.
@_date: 2015-06-30 07:53:51
I expect it to rise for the next week, then crash.
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:15:20
Why not?
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:00:19
I guess the only question I have is can bitpay disable my wallet if they want to?
It uses the BitPay API, so what if they go down or whatever reason go out of business?
@_date: 2015-06-10 07:04:20
Sure it does. They will know what to do. Better than leaving up to to give me advice and then have my coins lost.

@_date: 2015-06-05 08:02:25
You shouldn't try to "make money off Bitcoin". The ship has sailed long ago on the mining opportunity. The long sell maybe goes up, maybe down. 
What you *really* should be focusing on is "how can I use Bitcoin that I can't do with fiat?"
@_date: 2015-06-10 05:37:46
Nobody knows. its all a crap shoot at this point. Software is run by amateurs.
Companies are building out services, but then you're beholden to that company for the service to work. Which goes against the core principle. 
BlockStream is into something, not sure what.
I think as an investment the get-rich-quick days are long gone. I think just as easily somebody like Google or Microsoft can create their own version of it and sell it to big banks to use behind the scenes.
@_date: 2015-06-02 09:17:37
Yeah. It was a shitty defense. their best chance was to reveal how the FBI found the server and find out if his 4th amendment rights had been violated, but the judge threw that out. So they had to resort to blaming someone else. I don't believe any of it.
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:53:33
Too bad their UX is terrible.
@_date: 2015-06-05 07:37:49
yes, but if you believed they were going to a million then and you believe they are going to a million now....you'd have a lot more coins.
Any investment back then $1k would have gotten you plenty. Now you would get 4.
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:27:58

@_date: 2014-02-02 04:52:36
i think there will be competing currencies in a free market, which is healthy. Remember when all we had was Windows? Good god.
Maybe it stays at 1000, goes to 10k....or who knows. I don't think its going to be the one and only currency though. People are starting to notice altcoins. I think a lot of investors (including myself) feel they may make up some gains on altcoins that were lost to being a late adopter on Bitcoin.
I treat it like any investment portfolio. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

'cybersquats' sounds like you're either a bum or taking a shit in the street.
@_date: 2014-01-28 03:10:59
where do you live?
if in US, try coinbase. or localbitcoins.com

did you actually repaste this?

London will be the Wall Street of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-24 08:26:12
Until someone else sends money to it. I'm sure they can go back in history and do analysis to find out who has bought "drugs" in the past with their service based on recent transactions.
@_date: 2014-07-23 06:14:41
Yes, if dollar crashes we're all fucked. Bitcoin won't help us.
Although Trace Meyer did say if Bitcoin gets 1% of the offshore tax haven market it could be $2-5 million. I have no idea if there's any chance of that happening.
@_date: 2014-08-09 04:47:43
I'm sorry. I draw the line at dumpster diving. If you're homeless and starving, by all means. Dumpster dive.
But if you're developing the worlds global currency of the future and want people to have faith in your software and protocol, I expect just a little more class than that. Call me old fashioned.
Its a distustingly dirty thing to do, and you guys are supposed to the leaders in the community.
Do you pee on street signs and sides of buildings too?

@_date: 2014-02-06 05:54:56
internet does.
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:38:05
maybe we should create a real foundation, like W3C. With technology companies taking part, not guys called "Bitcoin Jesus" and guys who get arrested or run ponzis.
@_date: 2014-07-22 21:50:27
you're not making any sense.
@_date: 2014-08-03 19:52:00
I agree. Coinbase is crap now. They were good in early 2013.
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:56:16


They haven't actually confirmed this. I hope its true. But until the FED and all 50 state governments say this, then its simply not true.
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:35:38
Sure sounds like it is.
@_date: 2014-01-28 03:22:28
i think the criminalization is beginning.

Its fucking tulips man. You didn't know that.....and you bought 100BTC?
@_date: 2014-06-29 17:18:58
Ok, so everyone has heard of Justin Beiber by now, much like people have heard of Bitcoin. Of the 7B people on the planet, how many fully understand Bitcoin or even own some? Basically 0%. That' was my point.
@_date: 2014-03-19 04:47:35
yeah. facepalm.

everyone involved in a disruptive technology thinks it will change the world.
@_date: 2015-06-08 08:36:47
I don't believe it. I hope its true, but I have lost faith that it will happen, seeing as how amateurish this whole thing is.
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:03:50
all i can say is the first time my web site got hacked back in the 90s someone defaced the site with a "Free Kevin Mitnick" banner. I had no idea who or what that was.

what do you mean 2000 by sept 2014?
@_date: 2014-02-09 00:58:45
you should think of advertising on your site.
@_date: 2014-11-16 22:25:15
depends on the changes i guess. you could simply fork and implement a lower fee. I would assume this might be compatible with existing blockchain, but maybe I'm wrong.
@_date: 2014-08-10 00:08:19
Couldn't you mine other crypto currencies?

When did they raise the debt limit?

Email provider (yahoo mail) going down is not the same thing as Email protocol going down. Simple as that. Its a free market anyone can participate, and MtGox was first to market, by a long shot. They have had problems numerous times in the past couple of years (even crashing price down to a penny). People who know have stayed far, far away. The rest of the newbs simply ignored the warning labels (like cigarattes) and lost their money.

Obama fits into every debate. Because he's the president...and you're suggesting we let the government interfere with Bitcoin and everyone gets equal amount of Bitcoin like some kind of god damn kindergartner.

Have them all install the Dogecoin wallet and then send them each 1 doge. Should cost you about 50 cents.
@_date: 2014-02-06 07:44:33
seems like they would notice this and call it "volatility"

haha. could be. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 18:51:34

I don't know if you can do that sort of thing yet. Best thing to do is hold it in your own wallet until you can.

@_date: 2014-03-26 14:13:20
how come you don't have to pay taxes on that then....i just sent you a value?
its more like they are taxing math.
@_date: 2014-11-17 05:48:41
yup. full nodes would process them. .... i think. i actualy have no idea.
@_date: 2014-11-22 08:11:51
@_date: 2014-11-24 09:50:31
Yeah....I'm just saying, people say Bitcoin is like internet in 1994....which maybe true. But I think you're right, the next 5 years will develop the killer apps which will help make it used on more devices and transactions.
@_date: 2014-03-08 07:09:34
Could be all part of the act. He's denying he has 400 million dollars worth of Bitcoin. Burden of proof is on the person making the accusation.

I know. its so funny. and people say there is no usability problem. I'm supposed to know what the fuck that means?
@_date: 2014-03-29 00:52:32
afaik, its when you sell btc for something else.
@_date: 2014-10-18 03:58:46

@_date: 2014-07-05 21:50:38
I think its smart to add Litecoin and Dogecoin if you're a business. I would rather give them my business knowing they are at least a little aware of the crypto market rather than just trying to catch a fad by accepting Bitcoin only.
@_date: 2014-03-31 03:41:33
only once??

$600 is the minimum per year. Total. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:19:36
Oh man. I have State Farm, they are cheap but shitty. I got in a little fender bender, rear-ended someone at about 15 mph. and they raised my rates $400/year for next 6 years. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:39:57
so w/ capital gains tax, how much did that run ya?
@_date: 2014-03-01 06:29:10
what exactly?
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:41:17
so you just bought?
@_date: 2014-02-08 19:19:46
51% attack!
@_date: 2014-04-02 04:06:42


if you get 5 cents/transaction, and there are 100k transactions per  block that is $5,000 dollars
@_date: 2014-04-06 22:20:41
probably one guy dumping a lot of coins at market price.
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:18:41
its deflationary because coins are generated at a fixed rate. Supply is limited, at this point 12 million with a max of 21 million by 2140. and 25 coins added every 10 minutes.
Unlike the USD which adds 85 billion/month to the supply causing it to loose value over time.
Less coins means they increase in value over time as more people try to acquire them.

@_date: 2014-01-19 08:22:22
i wasn't actually predicting it. Trace Mayer was at Las Vegas Bitcoin convention. I'm just trying to figure how he could come up with such a number.
The only thing that makes me think he MIGHT be right (eventually) is that there are only 12 million coins in circulation. If there were only 21 million dollars in the world. How many USD satoshis would a cup of coffee cost?

thats' not a feature, that's a bug!
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:28:01
Banks have to comply. 1/31 is Chinese New Years.
Which means exchanges won't be able to work with banks anymore.
@_date: 2014-03-06 07:22:19
Damn. Good point. Well maybe you can use multibit and just send a satoshi to everyone.
You could also use a dogecoin web wallet.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:24:02
who the hell wants to keep records like that?
@_date: 2014-10-01 11:52:22
its like CB for internet.
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:12:11
i met the breadwallet guy. at first i thought he was a ponzi criminal...he overheard me talking about Bitcoin and came over and sat at our table. First thing he said is to install his wallet on my iPhone. I was a little leary as you might imagine. But i checked him out. he's legit.
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:08:03
I have domains there. They are legit.

no. i thought you were looking for a place to advertise.
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:34:22
Bitcoin would remain the currency of the people. But "SecondMarketCoin" would be used on wall street.

so its not taxable! is this actually good news!
@_date: 2014-08-13 08:52:30
i don't even think they were even *in* those countries before. I'm sure the reason they are aggressively expanding into those countries is because they can now accept payment there.
PayPal isn't in a lot of these countries because its too damn difficult and cost prohibitive. Bitcoin changes all that.
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:08:41
I'm not saying its better. Its just an option that can be easily accomplished.
@_date: 2014-08-13 07:46:42
 you know, its reasons like this that make me think maybe the NSA really *did* invent Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:52:01
it was a fucking joke, as was the OP.

@_date: 2014-09-22 08:40:41
how much?
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:22:31
I doubt it. In the case of IRS i think they were just getting pressure to make a guidance announcement and didn't bother to understand Bitcoin first. It kind of pisses me off that in a democracy, there is no public oversight on tax law.
I think China is just banning shit that scares them. I thought we already went through this and Jan 31 was when Bitcoin ban went into effect. Now its April 15? Wtf?

edit: good read. i think what you're saying *might* happen actually *is* happening. People are already exchanging dollars for Bitcoins because they know the FED/Gov ponzi scheme won't go on forever.

Humans are imperfect. We need regulators to complete us.
Whether you like it or not, there has been a lot of amateurs running the show up until recently. Enough is enough....going unchecked, people bitching about losing their Bitcoins when they invested w/o fully understanding what they were risking.
I hate to say it but I think this free market experiment is turning out to be a disaster and the first thing the weak hands will do is call on the government to save them, again.

@_date: 2014-02-15 23:07:01
it is funny that there are only 2 people protesting mtgox. shows how small bitcoin really is. if it was a national bank there'd be crowds of people rioting in the street.

At least they aren't adding insult to injury.
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:34:54
they are losing share. but its not because their platform sucks.
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:51:07
heh, yeah, wtf is this centralized eGold shit? Does she not even know the purpose and reason for Bitcoin in the first place? These just look like corporate lapdogs except for Charlie.
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:12:21
this keeps happening to Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2014-02-03 07:43:07
is this like an exchange or more of a coinbase?

@_date: 2014-08-11 07:04:58
I use multibit on a mac right now. but i hate having to backup wallets. Always afraid I'm going to fuck that up. Now 12 words....I think I can secure that. except if what you're saying is true. I alreayd installed this previously....I have no f---ing idea what those 12 words were.
@_date: 2014-08-06 04:13:56
Of course. But look at Tor. If they had a reward for operating a Tor network, we'd all be using it.
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:06:47
everyone on has been saying it for over a year.
mainstream media did not...to my knowledge, EVER say "don't use mtgox"
@_date: 2014-02-01 04:39:27
yeah. and if you destroy it, we're equally fucked.
@_date: 2014-01-30 19:13:01
general rule of thumb: don't invest more than  you're willing to lose.
@_date: 2014-03-27 01:54:30
This entire scene is starting to get old. Regulators, Goxings, IRS. I liked Bitcoin when it was free to anyone. Now a bunch of schmucks have tried to "legitimize" it and are failling miserably at it.

Could be. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:36:57
Lets put aside all the bullshit lip service (ie: curing world hunger, uplifting the poor, "the other 6B") and look at Bitcoin for what it is: a largely unusable currency system for the Internet. It wasn't until Netscape came around that made the Internet usable did it finally start to go mainstream.
We haven't seen that yet, except for Coinbase. But then its unsafe to use a web wallet. So people either use it out of curiosity for small amounts or they don't bother.
Its much easier for me to spend USD than it is to spend BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-11 03:03:12
how does it destroy them?

@_date: 2014-08-17 08:13:16
If coinbase is out of coins...shouldn't the price go up?
@_date: 2014-08-17 06:40:13
I feel the same way. The price is probably lower now than it was when they made the movie. Maybe they are just waiting for another bubble to release it.
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:30:55

cool. what about just running a full node? Would that qualify?
@_date: 2014-08-17 07:30:37
you sound like you voted for Obama expecting a different outcome than what you got. Or you truly believe he does no harm. Either way, I'm not really changing your mind on your idiotic proposal...so I'll leave it at that.
@_date: 2014-08-19 05:37:18
That's weird. I would have expected a precipitous drop after 2000. That's when they started QE.

it is a check. takes time. not really pp's fault.
@_date: 2014-03-28 21:45:33
No. You have to report IF you spend more than $600/year. This is much different than saying "any transaction over 600"
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:54:37
but that's not how people speak it. you may be right technically.

Yeah I remember that. He won, iirc.
@_date: 2014-10-06 07:53:19

i think the transactions are still traceable. unless you manage to register on an exchange that lets you use Tor.

I'm not an expert but I see a transaction and confirmation of a transaction as two different things.
You can see the transaction instantly. But you need to wait for confirmations to be able to spend it.
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:39:01
coinbase, bitpay, gocoin seem to be the best. I personally would go with gocoin, as you can also accept Litecoin.
@_date: 2014-02-09 22:12:22
Yeah that's what I mean. You either like bitcoin for what it is or you don't. But why do you need to pass laws regulating it?

the mcxNOW was more of a planned disappearance. I guess you weren't really reading about why they closed. BTC-e is strong and is probably the most competent exchange.

I'm not sure what block.io is using under the hood. And the problems with bitcoind is that it doesn't scale. block.io knows how to handle payments, its free, just use that. You can make a payment from any block.io address to any bitcoin address. Its not as easy as you think to build your own system to do this.
Basically, you can generate a payment address with their api which you control. Then the buyer pays your address and you get notified when payment is sent. You can then release the item to the buyer. Then when that confirms, you can do a withdrawal for that amount...minus your fee of course...into the sellers Bitcoin address (does not need to be a block.io address) and you're done.
You would want to build some kind of an invoicing system, which should be pretty easy. Create an invoice for a transaction, mark it as "payment pending". When the money is sent, you can mark it as "paid". Pretty easy to do.
I have plans to build this exact thing, but I haven't gotten that far in my project yet. I've just thought about it a lot and talked with people. Feel free to tell me how I can improve this method.

I don't believe that claim "everything is encrypted client-side, so there's nothing we can do".
You absolutely can modify the javascript on your servers to infiltrate a wallet. Especially if you have a court order to do so, why should we believe you're not going to comply?
This is exactly why Lavabit shutdown, because he wasn't willing to compromise his users on a large scale when the government asked him to, even after complying previously.
Are you prepared to shutdown your business to protect the integrity of it? I think not.

well mining real (not scam technically). if you can manage to get your miner in a timely fashion its profitable for a good 6 months. But its an arms race. As soon as you receive your miner, you need to:
* a) make back your reinvestment
* b) save towards your next miner, which is another 6 months out
If these miner companies can actually deliver in less than 3-6 months from when you order, then it might be worth doing. I suspect that more ASIC developers will enter the market that can handle large orders....also  driving the price down.
Basically the risk is that the difficulty skyrockets between now and when you get your miner, rendering it obsolete.

Why? We had regulation and it didn't stop shit. It never does. There are always people who get around it, usually those at the top or who pay the politicians off to pass regulation in their favor.
Its rediculous that you're actually suggesting we adapt a decentralized anonymous open source project to regulation. Its the regulation that needs to adapt to Bitcoin.
Have you actually read Lawsky's terms? You can't even release an open source currency project w/o complying w/ his license? THat's fucked up and pretty sure it will be shot down in court.
Not to mention regulation leads to less competition. The small startups can't afford to comply with regulation in 50 states (let alone international regulations). That's going to cost $15 million just to be in compliance. I will start my business in another jurisdiction that doesnt' require such assinine requirements. And I'll take my jobs and profits with me.

I never mined, so I don't know what the implication is. I suspect you just report it as income when you convert it to fiat.
As for trading cryptos, I never sell for fiat, I only trade cryptos back and forth. From what I've been told, there are only tax implications when you convert back to fiat...as capital gains (short term/long term). But I would ask an accountant.
@_date: 2014-02-01 22:42:10
i don't really see the problem. all major brokerages allow you to trade on margin which could easily result in losing your principal and more. But bitcoin swings a few percentage points and its TOO VULNERABLE!!!

if you're talking about the pictures every post about Bitcoin the MSM uses, then I think that's just a digital representation of a "coin" which is purely made up. They don't exist physically. But because MSM is retarded, they need to show a picture of a "coin" when mentioning Bitcoin.

I use multibit -  to store on my computer. Using an offline wallet is probably your best/safest option unless you run windows and have malware or something. Also need to backup your private keys.
There are lots of web wallets beside coinbase though. Blockchain.info is probably the most popular one. But keep in mind there is NO password reset option if you're using a secure wallet. You also have to backup your private keys as well.
I think there are some desktop javascript wallets you can download the code from github and run the code locally in your browser. But I don't use them so I'm not sure what the good ones are.
@_date: 2014-02-18 00:15:24
i think its going to still happen with other exchanges, but since gox had 80% of the bitcoin market at one point, this will most likely the be furthest fall from grace....unless blockchain.info or coinbase.com go south.

Well, theres these two guys TwinkleToes or something (they are olympic rowing twins who wanted to beat up Mark Zuckerberg -- until he gave them his lunch money). They are starting an ETF or some kind of fund. Nobody really knows for sure, but it is "progressing nicely" and "inching foward". SO maybe another year or two and anybody can buy Bitcoin on the NASDAQ stock exchange....that is if ISIS (the dudes who just sacked Baghdad and stole 500 million USD from banks and golds) doesn't start using Bitcoin before Americans. If that happens we will all be on terrorist watch list just for saying "Bitcoin" or "crypto".

I suggest you open up a Simple.com account, transfer $10k there or whatever, and buy via coinbase without exceeding the daily limit.
This price probably isn't going to go through the roof anytime soon, so you can probably buy your 29BTC in 4-5 days worth of transactions.
It really pisses me off that banks do this. Its your money, not theirs, and they put up all kinds of road blocks if you try to spend more than $10k

Simply forking and starting your own doesn't accomplish much (see alts) without the network.
@_date: 2014-08-16 17:32:58
I wondered about this too. 3 doesnt' seem like enough to me. Once a node goes down it could be gone forever. Plus, isn't the advantage of p2p is that you download from a swarm? Which is usually a lot more than 3 if its a popular file.

I think its still in its infancy. We are just now getting mainstream coverage. About a year ago when i first started following Bitcoin there was about 1 Bitcoin related news article in Google News every 2 weeks. Now I get 30-40 alerts per day. People didn't know what the Internet actually was for a long time too. And of course it was used by pedophiles and terrorists as reported in the news. Eventually the technology won out.
I remember YHOO stock would move 10% because they went down for 15 minutes. Everyone would claim the Internet was dead.

Right. That's why I say use block.io to handle the payments. You handle the inventory and payment between two addresses. Take 20% for yourself or whatever.
The option is to use bitcoind which is a horrible idea.
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:14:44
I think you are wrong about that. Don't they still take a cut of the transaction even if you hold BTC?

Son, we live in a world that has trolls. And those trolls have to be guarded by men like me. Who's gonna do it? You?? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for regular users and you curse the revolution. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know: That centralized death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives.
You don't want the truth. Because deep down, in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on You need me on We use words like crypto, code, bitcoin... we use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something. You use 'em as a punchline.
I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the trolling that I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it. I'd prefer you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you create a fake account and start trolling. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you're entitled to.
@_date: 2014-01-31 05:12:15

@_date: 2014-03-28 07:51:22
There's a simple flow chart that you can follow to determine what your tax obligation is:
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:00:06
I have $0.20410 USD on Mtgox and can't get it out! Help help!.
@_date: 2014-11-17 00:08:02
Yeah. brick and mortar is a joke, imo. They are already setup to use credit cards and cash.
The real benefit here is global transactions online and micropayments.
Its like trying to get a library to provide streaming video tutorials instead of books....not gonna happen.
@_date: 2014-11-17 01:50:26
 i'll tip what i want. this is bitcoin dammit!
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:55:22
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:01:38
yeah. reddcoin seemds to be inflationary as well.

Oh god. It's all in good fun. They suck and take advantage if the poorest of the poor.

This sounds like some andreas would say.
@_date: 2014-02-03 06:44:14
Bitcoin is a gateway currency.
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:19:51
is that supposed to mean something to me?
@_date: 2014-03-08 08:08:37
Moores law doesn't cover shit when it comes to bandwidth.
@_date: 2014-07-24 18:30:49
that would be horrible.

I love that video. "I just showed you a picture by one of the most influential artists of our time...AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY YOUR FARTS SMELL."
@_date: 2014-05-10 06:16:31
@_date: 2014-11-17 05:58:30
so have you have BTC and want cash?
@_date: 2014-09-09 04:50:20
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:54:11
haha. you don't remember The Anarchist's Cookbook when you were a kid?
@_date: 2014-03-31 03:45:38
what about using it as a currency?
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:44:19


huh??? this sounds like FUD to me.
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:29:39
what i said. 'guy with biggest knife wins'.

it really does seem like NWO created it when you see the verification required by these ATMs.

haha. there's a sucker born every minute isn't there?
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:35:49
Yeah, i find it odd this guy broke any policy.
@_date: 2014-12-20 06:03:19
thanks SirBitt. I will turn by $1 tip into 10k in 10 years by sitting on it :)

China banned Bitcoin again.
@_date: 2014-04-02 07:01:05
whatever it is, its impossible to keep track of for tax purposes -- so why bother at this point?
@_date: 2014-01-27 00:22:27
just install it. its obvious you haven't even tried.
@_date: 2014-10-18 06:19:00
$41 for 10k bitcoin. damn it. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 00:16:55

Yeah. people are really stupid.

@_date: 2014-03-27 02:29:43
i am on the opinion that claiming Bitcoin gains will mean audit every year for the rest of your life. So good luck with that.
@_date: 2014-05-08 09:17:32
@_date: 2014-02-02 23:00:24
yeah. i think that's probably why they list MySQL so they can do transactions, but its suprising they didn't already use them.
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:46:55
dammit! 480 :(
@_date: 2014-03-20 06:35:34
he uses a url shortener, so reddit would need to first follow all redirects to determine the final destination. i doubt their system is that smart.
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:45:51
Naah. it won't be a bitcoin clone that replaces Bitcoin. It will be something totally new.
@_date: 2014-11-03 01:15:05
dumpers gonna dump

get out of gox. that exchange is going down.
@_date: 2014-03-20 07:04:13

maybe. i'm just expecting 10k in 2014.
@_date: 2014-11-24 18:40:50
I'm sure posting it here won't get them upset.
Seriously, I think you are protected by parody laws. Its legal to use someone's logo if you are mocking them. Might want to hire a lawyer though or at least talk to one.
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:28:40
There's nothing wrong with people being skeptical of Bitcoin. You'd be a fool to trust it because some shady memory dealer guy named "Bitcoin Jesus" tells you to believe in it.
@_date: 2014-05-10 03:32:26
i'm going to have to see some credentials.
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:22:57
not that i know of.
@_date: 2014-04-03 17:01:02
didn't they just halt trading due to "suspicious activity"?
@_date: 2014-08-03 03:04:27
Yeah, I need to buy BTC with USD.

the "B w/ vertical bars" is already used. It was stupid to use it to begin with. Better change now before its even bigger.
@_date: 2014-02-03 06:28:58

nope. there's another company that does this exact same thing...can't remember the name though.

Best. Ponzischeme. Ever. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 05:23:49
what. you don't think they manipulate it?
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:16:02
i just told you.
@_date: 2014-12-29 04:23:01
zzzzzz....let me know when you *actually* do this.

that's like giving it to a homeless guy.
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:29:04
Wait. what? Do you have a link or some kind of evidence?
@_date: 2014-01-13 06:56:11
for the lazy: 
@_date: 2014-07-19 04:50:19
Or he just deleted the keys accidentally thinking it was his test wallet. They may never move. He could just have no incentive besides wanting to change the status quo at this point. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 05:50:26
@_date: 2014-03-05 06:13:21
Bitcoin is likely to quadruple. Do you think Gold will?
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:14:51
sure use `/address/&lt;address&gt;` url
@_date: 2014-08-03 03:59:22
I'll upvote. maybe they will take notice. I dont' really like that coinbase is our only option.
@_date: 2014-08-10 17:38:06
You miss the point 
@_date: 2014-09-22 08:38:10
No. i want to scan a QR code in the browser on my mac.
@_date: 2014-04-02 06:40:41
i think the interest in bitcoin is gone from the public eye.
@_date: 2014-05-10 03:41:23
i think you need a criminal record to be on the Bitcoin Foundation.
@_date: 2014-08-03 20:29:36
They do ACH?

awesome logo!
@_date: 2014-11-28 18:48:34
You want me to leave? Do you want to live in the dark and disbelief that there is nothing wrong with Bitcoin and it is the future of money? At best bitcoin is beta max.
@_date: 2014-12-29 05:08:13
So they arrest you and throw you in jail until you give them the key. What good is this? You *can* be compelled to reveal your keys. Unless you're some sort of martyr and would set yourself on fire to prove a point.
@_date: 2014-09-29 05:57:19
already on simpsons over a year ago when Lisa was talking to Krusty the Klown, how he went broke with some bad investments in the bitcoin markets.

yes, i under the reason. but i simply don't trust you will secure my private identity. after mtgox id database got hacked and is being sold to highest bidder, I will never upload a passport/id again. ever.
@_date: 2014-07-28 03:41:22
there's a security minded distro. can't think of the name of it right now.
@_date: 2014-04-02 07:38:52
i'm just saying....saving my money and not spending it is now "hoarding". which I find amusing.
@_date: 2014-07-02 03:21:26
Checkout the list here: 
@_date: 2014-02-03 01:44:46
haha. sorry. 
I could be wrong, but I thought it was a wallet + social network app. Maybe I'm thinking of something else.
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:09:38
right now i think it depends on the wallet, usually it defaults to .0001 but some wallets let you set it to whatever you want or 0.
I think there is some discussion of making the fee dynamic though. Not sure how that will work.
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:57:34

or a yahoo account.
@_date: 2014-01-20 04:31:45
are those your paper wallets? If so, we need to talk physical security.
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:49:58
that would be good, no?
@_date: 2014-11-17 05:55:22
just be careful. only do it with play money. you could loose your ass in this game. also, checkout  if you do execute a trade and want to see your return before you close it.
@_date: 2014-08-06 17:28:29
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:51:14
I don't know if I trust these guys to keep the software open source and in the hands of the people. It's starting to sound like development of bitcoin will go to the highest bidder. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 15:20:19
I expect you are now on the do-not-fly list.
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:40:54
you sound like you have skinny calfs
@_date: 2014-10-01 12:11:49

i think there's a chance they will resume.
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:25:42
yup. full frontal assault with that coordinated "multi blog announcement" the other day. i found it distasteful and makes me think Btc Foundation is just a front for a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2014-02-01 19:14:35
odd that its a prius. seeing as how you waste electricity mining bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-17 18:25:20
@_date: 2014-02-01 18:52:25
"How many BTC do you have?"
Nice try IRS.
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:43:05
There was a post the other day that linked to a transaction on the blockchain with 500K Bitcoins from 2011. I don't know how many they have now, its just a guess but that number of coins at today's prices is almsot half a billion.
@_date: 2014-03-16 19:39:59
what is Pounce?
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:04:49
Free market! scammers gonna scam.
Seriously, if we operated under a free market our streams would be filled with human shit.
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:17:13
paragraphs buddy.
@_date: 2014-11-23 10:01:46
what a stupid segment. 90% of people would probably lie if they got a free gift card out of it.
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:43:31
Yeah, I was shocked when I saw some Bitcoin news footage from Japan and saw commercials for hot pockets. That's not really what I think of when I [think of Japan](
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:26:54
its like email for money. think of it as points for the internet.
@_date: 2014-04-03 19:14:47
I can't wait for Facebook to be my bank too!
@_date: 2014-02-21 05:37:07
i totally agree with you. shit happens. life goes on. the weak hands will never enter Bitcoin now. Fine...they are the ones who usually panic sell at the slightest sign of trouble anyway.
You have to have balls to invest in this shit...and brains enough to keep living if you lose it all.
The technology is here to stay. Digital currencies will not disappear after mtgox crashes. We are only  at the beginning. 2013 was really the first time people have heard of Bitcoin. They fucking "heard" of bitcoin. They don't know what it is...they don't have a wallet. They don't engage in commerce with Bitfucking coins. They just heard about it like my grandpa heard of email back in 1994 when he read about it in the newspaper.
@_date: 2014-11-16 20:44:44
This is a killer app. It took me awhile to understand "WHY" you would want this. BUt if you want to accept multiple currencies and payout in one its perfect.
@_date: 2014-03-06 07:58:33
its best just to put it behind us.
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:50:57
its better to just charge a micropayment in this day and age. I think the advertising model is dead. It has never worked for me. All it does is end up alienating your visitors. And people are stingy to donate. Unless you beg for it, you might not get any. The WhatsApp only charged $1/year and they sold to FB for 19B.
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:16:39
no. mining is just like password cracking. only when you crack the puzzle, you get some bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-13 07:38:36
what's a p2p wallet?
@_date: 2014-01-26 23:41:53
Here's why: 
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:38:48
Its not a good investment. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:16:28
haha. nice. tell her to kiss it good bye we're going much MUCH lower than this.
@_date: 2014-03-11 06:14:14
do they have funds there?
@_date: 2014-03-27 00:53:47
What a tool. How do this idiots get elected? Seriously. I know we're now  in education but c'mon!
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:33:30
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:17:03
that's awesome. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 05:30:31
I mainly use exchanges for altcoins because I literally have no other option.
I am not going to run 20 different versions of Bitcoin-QT for each currency and wait 18 years for all the blockchains to download.
@_date: 2014-04-03 19:52:54
comparatively speaking the footprint for a single bitcoin user is much *MUCH* larger.
@_date: 2014-08-17 08:05:56
@_date: 2014-07-21 07:36:24
I will also offer it at this price. Let's make a pact. Neither of us sell for &lt; 100k.
@_date: 2014-04-02 03:45:33
What is a 'liter'? This is Cincinnati dammit!
@_date: 2014-11-16 07:51:13
who cares what business-standard.com thinks?
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:23:27
I think FEDs shut down MtGox and Mark is on a gag order. That is the only thing that explains the "Down temporarily" announcement with no real information.
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:40:52
I bet half the poeple who actually do the IRS calculation result in a loss and IRS now owes them a refund.
@_date: 2014-01-30 22:26:51
Yeah, the "experts" were a little questionable in my opinion. Although Charlie seems to have been the most qualified to be there. But what about Gavin, or Andreas? It would have gone much better to have people who stand up for Bitcoin's core principles there instead of some slick businessmen in a suite who is cares more about making money off it.
@_date: 2014-03-23 17:28:18
Except the problem is not going to get better. Its going to get worse. A lot worse.
@_date: 2014-03-20 05:50:30
When it doesn't suck.
@_date: 2014-11-17 00:27:19
fuck off. obama will be out of office soon. i hope hillary loses in 2016. and we'll get a republican to put guys like you back in the basement.
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:42:26
stream is offline now. i guess they sleep.
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:20:42
so why hasn't Obama's  youtube channel been deleted yet? Surely we can get 3 of us together.
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:28:14
even if you are.
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:20:41
Just talk to democrats.
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:30:57
sure, to answer your other question about tipping, there are tipping bots on some sites (like reddit, twitter), but usually I just find a journalist or podcaster who published their bitcoin address on their site and I can tip them directly.
it also lends itself to micro paywalls. I could pay 25 cents worth of BTC to the New York Times for a day's access to their site...for example. Which imo is a great way to monetize online newpapers.
@_date: 2014-07-05 18:51:39
51% ghash?
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:53:49
@_date: 2014-02-06 05:55:24
do they have unlimited data?
@_date: 2014-07-05 18:10:21
That is all true. But it's bound to happen sooner or later. Bitcoin is an attempt to provide a viable alternative. You can stay on the titanic. Or you can take your chances on the little fishing boat. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:23:09
you only get a refund on what they've already collected.
@_date: 2014-10-06 10:03:26
Why do all the desktop wallets suck?
@_date: 2014-03-10 04:43:01
haha. all cryptos are scams.
@_date: 2014-10-24 05:45:00
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:02:09
you keep forgetting the obvious. Satoshi Nakamoto is Dorian's real name. Why would he go to great lengths to conceal his identity only to use his real name in his communications?
@_date: 2014-02-02 23:57:49
so how is that different than gambling?
@_date: 2014-12-15 07:01:55

I don't go around telling everyone they need to use Netflix everyday. If there's value in it, then it should be obvious to people. Its not obvious w/ Bitcoin, probably due to poor usability and difficulty in acquiring bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:04:06
exchanges are centralized. that's what needs to change.

no. i'm just here to piss off people like you.
@_date: 2014-11-25 04:45:25
Sounds like it flew right over their head. They heard "digital" and "payment" and cut-n-paste their answer from a script.
They probably just thought "bitcoin" was a typo and you meant to say "Apple Pay".
@_date: 2014-03-20 07:39:59
and its not a single page app???
@_date: 2014-10-18 06:04:32
Yes, indirectly i'm stocks. Obviously. I'm not investing in them directly as they are too volatile. I have better luck with mutfunds.
@_date: 2014-12-22 10:18:27
Are there any good payment APIs being worked on that would allow anyone to implement payments on their site that isn't going through some 3rd party like BitPay or Coinbase?
To me its a little silly that a so-called "digital currency" for the Internet doesn't even have an easy API to implement into web sites wanting to accept payment or build services utilizing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-06 06:28:19
i bought at this $300 price. What's the worst that could happen? It goes down, i'll buy more. It goes up well, then we're good.
Who knows what this 30k wall means....but I do know after having watching Bitcoin for almost 2 years that when something *does* happen, the market reacts in a big way.
@_date: 2014-02-17 06:20:10

@_date: 2014-02-01 22:39:42
oh yeah. haters down voting. i think this may be the top. if it doesn't start going further...i mean, why is apple or google stock go past $1000? We all expect Bitcoin to be 10k or more.
@_date: 2014-03-31 03:52:53
you have to go back and get price data for an exchange for each transaction at the time you bought the Bitcoin and at the time you made the transaction for goods/services. Its not as easy as you claim.
@_date: 2014-12-24 08:40:44
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:49:25
is there a chart for this?
@_date: 2014-11-17 07:10:08
Pretty sure they will....eventually. Or bitcoin will be at zero.
there is no inbetween.
@_date: 2014-07-02 01:22:27
it will spawn newbs like gox.
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:55:34
80b? that would be nice. Although this stagnant price has me a little worried. We should be due for another rally soon. Hopefully another doubling.

i doubt it. because you don't hang out at a bank to catch drug dealers do you, even though they use cash.
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:40:44

i did it about a week ago, w/o any problems.
@_date: 2014-08-16 03:39:56
Its a proposal. For NYC.
Sure, its sets a terrible precedent and I hope this sort of thing isn't going to be  a common experience. But you may be right, although I think a lot of Bitcoin users don't care about Lawsky and his stupid BitLicense.
I've been talking to some people who are planning on buying in at around $450 and they didn't even know about this BitLicense bullshit.
@_date: 2014-08-03 19:26:04
....and then they looked into Bitcoin more closely and started letting apps in again. Frankly, I don't have a problem with them being cautious.

Interest in Bitcoin is dying. The hype is over, nobody is talking about it. It will take another major event to start getting mainstream interest again. Most people think a drop from $1200 to $600 is not a good investment. Of course they first heard about it when it was $1200.
@_date: 2014-10-01 12:28:56
lol. naah man CB. Like Citizen's Band radio. Dukes of Hazard and shit...am I that old already? Nobody knows wtf a CB is?
@_date: 2014-01-19 06:08:30
10 billion to 210 billion is a 20 times increase. That puts the number at 20,000/btc. not 2.8 million/btc.
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:26:28
Trace Mayer also said 2-5 million per coin.
@_date: 2014-08-12 03:35:05
i don't think people looking to use tax shelters will care about that much.
@_date: 2014-05-01 22:31:36
@_date: 2014-03-20 07:16:03
there's also gocoin.com
i think it just depends. the fees are pretty high.
I would check for a plugin for your shopping cart first see if you can use bitcoin network directly.
@_date: 2014-02-02 20:58:45
The one I saw, asks you to create a coinbase account (for which they get a referral fee) to send your .00001 btc to (about 2 cents).
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:38:32
glad we cleared that up.

what is very clear?
@_date: 2014-07-26 10:28:46
Yeah, i was going to go the bitcoind route. I figure the basic steps are:
* generate a new bitcoin address in a wallet (does bitcoind have a wallet?)
* watch for a transaction in this new address
* when transaction appears, notify app that payment has been sent
* app then continues on and marks invoice as paid w/ transaction id.

Well  you sure as hell missed the point :)
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:51:50
Ok, well maybe its a compromised computer.
But I've also heard that 2FA is a farce if you have to actually enter the number on an infected computer.
@_date: 2014-02-05 05:06:30
yeawh. its global.
and a lot of theset bitcoin projects are being developed by remote collaboration. no need to be onsite in some slave shop.

Why is that always their default answer to everything?
I had my car broken into, and they sent two police out to the door, who proceeded to explain how "they don't have the resources to file police reports".
...to which I said, "I'm the victim of a crime here, and it is your job to file a police report, is it not?"
They didn't say anything after that. Try calling again maybe. I don't know. Hire a PI maybe.

Yeah, but gov't can do what they want, include ignoring its own laws. Its like trying to explain Bitcoin to an 80 year old.

I just telling you what I see. Literally nobody uses or even cares about Bitcoin. You have a few vocal companies trying to change that but so far, its falling on deaf ears. If the finance industry jumps on board with banning it will likely go uncontested. Because virtually nobody uses Bitcoin yet, you won't see any global protest like you did SOPA which threatened every internet business and individual.
@_date: 2014-07-26 09:16:07
i mean don't send your bitcoin to a wallet you don't control. Take ownership. Learn to encrypt a backup of your multibit keys and store in a thumbdrive and on a remote location.

@_date: 2014-02-08 23:25:31
it takes awhile. i recommend you setup a bank account at simple.com and fund it from your own bank. Just to be careful, there are reports of banks freezing accounts when transfering to coinbase.

Yeah, but back then there was not shit about Bitcoin except for sites that looked like 10 year old made them. I avoided mtgox for about 1.5 years because of their homepage. Turns out that was a good decision in the long run. When you searched for "Bitcoin" in Google. literally every other site was some wierd "Gold bug" guy with his shitty looking blog selling adsense ads. It didn't lend to credibility. So I figured I'd ask some people.

I'm just here to get rich in 10 years.
@_date: 2014-03-28 07:45:14
too risky. its like trading forex.  you could lose your shirt. if you believe in it long term, buy a little each week.
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:33:37
much higher price.
@_date: 2014-02-10 01:26:44
use bitpay. let those decide for themselves if its worth it or not.
even late adopters are able to replinish their bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-08 04:02:24
well, if anyone is going to represent Bitcoin at these hearings....then it should be Andreas.
@_date: 2014-08-12 05:22:51
@_date: 2014-03-26 13:45:04
You play football in your country too???
@_date: 2014-05-15 20:59:56
a bitcoin transaction isn't an agreement between two parties.
Just because I send you a contract over email, doesn't mean its enforcable without a court I can go to to force you to abide.
@_date: 2014-10-30 05:52:03
why not?
@_date: 2014-06-01 20:07:47
Yup, this is not a ponzi in anyway shape or form.
I would pay $10 for a decent wallet. But if you start centralizing any part of the transaction process I will move to a different wallet.
@_date: 2014-08-03 01:14:29
He should have encrypted all the documents and put them up on BitTorrent then have a dead mans switch that automatically released the private keys to the world if something happened to him. 
I believe wiki leaks has done something like this with terabytes worth of data. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:57:40
Japanese court I imagine.
@_date: 2014-04-30 01:42:37
Mark Dice got banned. He had funny videos where he interviewed the public about fake petitions. He also had some conspiracy stuff up there. I never did hear why he was banned.
@_date: 2014-08-19 18:30:53
It has something to do with religion and th devil in think. Not sure. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 06:01:53
I don't get it? What do hotdogs have to do with Fox News?
@_date: 2014-04-02 04:29:22
Bitcoin hacked! OMG! Run!
@_date: 2014-11-27 07:11:13
That's great. I got 2 days when I found out my dad was dying. I feel very fortunate just to have had that little time to say goodbye.
@_date: 2014-02-22 23:59:57
no. site does not load. i don't get anything other than a connection error.
@_date: 2014-09-16 03:54:23
what do you mean letter substitution? my dad used an "O" (letter-o) for a "0" (zero) on his license plate and I waited 30 minutes at dmv while arguing that the car actually existed.
@_date: 2014-12-24 08:36:17
what's zerocrash?
@_date: 2014-07-10 02:02:16
I did 2 of 2. Fort wife and I. There is no third person. Is that a requirement?
@_date: 2014-02-02 06:44:45
In the US it is illegal.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:20:55
Only invest it if you're willing to lose it.
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:26:50
Pretty sure that's why they chose to operate out of Bulgaria...to avoid said regulations and regulators.
@_date: 2014-08-14 04:00:46
i would focus on finding a better paying job where you can afford to drop money (and lose it) on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-15 20:11:59
2013 was too. 2014 is turning out to be the 2008 of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-19 18:02:07
No. Israeli
@_date: 2014-02-01 05:26:32
dammit. so am i :(
@_date: 2014-11-24 18:16:26
Yes, that's my concern as well.
@_date: 2014-08-04 04:31:23
6-12 months. my own prediction.
@_date: 2014-07-23 03:39:10
yes, it will be a problem. Bitmessage was same way. Too difficult to use and the public channels were overrun by degenerates spamming them with shit you never want to see.
@_date: 2014-02-06 04:29:56
i was checking the headers for a date.
@_date: 2014-06-14 04:45:35
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:30:17
and your ignoring the complete history and usage of the word. that would be like me arguing the 'n-----' is just a word and you shouldn't be offended by it.
@_date: 2014-04-03 05:26:26
Quite honestly that is the best advice.
@_date: 2014-02-03 06:02:08
this is cool. is there a site that allows independent artists to upload their work and accept bitcoin?
This looks like your site for your band.
@_date: 2014-01-31 03:51:10
Why do we use biblical references to describe a technology that overthrows those in power...religion being one of the many tools at their disposal to keep us inline.
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:25:04
How do I ban you?
@_date: 2014-04-03 16:04:51
....and "Today is Thursday"
@_date: 2014-01-14 06:14:40
i think you're doing it wrong.
@_date: 2014-12-22 10:47:00
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:55:19
yeah. i think so.
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:59:16
They ban it every other thursday.
@_date: 2014-07-27 04:18:15
what do you mean I can't send Bitcoin from my site?
@_date: 2014-02-09 00:51:23
the lower it goes the less it is worth.
@_date: 2014-07-05 20:31:08
What the price after a year?
@_date: 2014-11-24 18:58:22
That's only 5 words
@_date: 2014-04-01 20:08:29
How about nothing. Bitcoin is nothing.
@_date: 2014-10-04 09:03:32
this is why i don't use 2FA.
@_date: 2014-11-17 06:20:33
I'm going to have to mark you down on the incorrect capitalization of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-24 04:59:02
i like the idea. they just charge a low monthly fee to participate and they convert the usd to bitcoin and send it to you. your company doesn't have to know what you are doing.
@_date: 2014-02-01 22:40:22
if thats the case it could take 6 hours.
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:12:27
people still hate .info
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:46:36
seems secure.
@_date: 2014-07-06 00:57:11
Oh well. It was worth a shot. I hope nobody paid for this.
@_date: 2014-02-02 20:31:11
actually, the fact that they fixed their bug immediately increases my confidence. no software is bug free. its the nature of the game.
kudos to OP for exposing and returning the coins, and to the exchange for taking immediate action.
@_date: 2014-04-07 02:22:16
haha. thanks man. now go watch the film.

great, another soon-to-be-hacked exchange.
@_date: 2014-08-13 07:32:58
Dude. I love the site. so simple. I go there for everything. You're probably not old enough to remember, but this is exactly how Yahoo started.
@_date: 2014-11-24 18:58:35
ponzi scheme....wait....is it...no.
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:33:41
i heard they were selling the ID database w/ everyone's verifications. I don't know what you can do with my address and drivers license...but that's not good. 
I expect these Bitcoin Foundation lackies to start telling congress "NO VERIFICATION" for Bitcoin exchanges. Otherwise I will just buy on the blackmarket anonymously.
@_date: 2014-12-24 04:14:42
You're "all in"? You should not be giving investment advice.
@_date: 2014-10-06 08:44:18
I'm starting to wonder if this was orchestrated, so they could spin Bitcoin in negative light with mainstream news again. A few million to accomplish the complete and total annihilation of Bitcoin in the average person's mind is a small price to pay.
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:28:04
@_date: 2014-08-11 02:47:08
I don't know where he gets his figure from, but I would not be surprised if in 10 years its either worth $0 or $2-5 million each.
I don't think there is an inbetween.
@_date: 2014-08-09 04:39:34
That isn't true. I've been on here for nearly 2 years. I delete my history every few months. When there is too much blindness I pull off the blinders.
@_date: 2014-08-10 05:03:30
for some reason i read that as 'fiances'
@_date: 2014-02-15 22:07:18
thanks for letting us know.
@_date: 2014-07-28 03:17:07
there's some conviction!
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:27:04
Some things should be obvious. Have you seen their site?
@_date: 2014-08-16 22:46:57
weird, my node isn't on that list, but its on atlas.
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:46:02
Doc...is that blockchain fueled by bananas?
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:38:39
FUCK. ID database? We keep on getting fucking goxxed.
@_date: 2014-03-06 06:42:57
That would be horrible. And its the main reason I buy instead of mine. Too much to risk. I've heard of a few cases where miners caught on fire.
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:53:36
no fastcoin?
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:04:08
Hey did you hear? Newegg is taking Bitcons.
@_date: 2014-10-06 08:41:44
the best strategy is buy a little bit on a regular basis, regardless of price.
@_date: 2014-12-26 05:59:22
and Fire stick
@_date: 2014-03-08 09:07:03
yeah. i could be wrong about that. some of those old hackers who started the PC club would be in the know.
@_date: 2014-08-03 22:22:09
That would be bad ass. I'd watch that film.
Ask the bitcoinfilms.org guy. He would probaby help you out in best way to fund a documentary.
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:48:53
All I'm saying is JP Morgan has the money, and so do a ton of other banks. They could outsource. Someone would be willing to build it out for the right price.
@_date: 2014-01-31 07:58:56
try a week. i gave up after a week. 3 years in a row.

someone did a data dump of their customer list the other day.
@_date: 2014-04-01 17:23:30
Is this a case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing?

LOL. Why????

read what?

this concerns me. isnt' btc-e in russia?
@_date: 2014-05-17 03:28:32
old news. they've been saying these same vague statements for a year now.
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:34:37
doesn't mean you won't get prosecuted.
@_date: 2014-08-06 03:48:20
because they could convert it to BTC and spend it. Or spend it on sites that accept it directly.
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:22:10
remember. there is no statute of limitations on tax evasion.
@_date: 2014-09-11 05:41:04
they said the same thing about iTunes when it first came out. They even created posters that said "Hell froze over" with a picture of iTunes + Windows computer.

@_date: 2014-10-06 08:42:26
they really need some expertise. These open source wallets all suck ass.

you put the 's' in the wrong place.
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:21:12
Have you been under a rock the past 4 months?
@_date: 2014-07-25 07:54:46
That was the first thing I asked them about privacy. Their response was literally "We are not concerned with privacy".
@_date: 2014-11-17 05:56:56
interesting idea. bypass the whole TMI/KY/DMA regulations altogehter!
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:17:15
@_date: 2014-04-08 04:49:24
i'll give it a few years for the technology to develop.
@_date: 2014-03-11 04:15:40
i know. i'm just asking because if you're using it to circumvent blackouts or torrent, there are better solutions than a VPN.
If you just want to surf anonymously, then VPN is good. I used vpnbook.com which is free.
@_date: 2014-03-10 04:02:50
yeah, the risk associated with giving someone your billing info is a large one. Especially for mom and pop places. bitcoin aleviates that. but then the risk is shifted to your wallet storage.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:25:52

  //add diaper changing logic here....tbd
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:49:09
Yeah. its dead as far as I'm concerned. They couldn't regulate it, so they taxed it to death.
@_date: 2014-01-15 02:28:07
free market problem. free market solutions. you're making too much sense.
@_date: 2014-04-12 06:22:53

Haha. I stand corrected.  
@_date: 2014-12-20 04:25:35

somehow i don't think he's actually talking about spaghetti.
@_date: 2014-03-14 05:24:13
i agree with this guy mostly.
@_date: 2014-03-20 05:35:31
@_date: 2014-02-18 23:24:41
you should post this there.
@_date: 2014-05-01 22:27:45
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:54:03
so you ignored the warnings and now want a bailout?
@_date: 2014-11-25 05:01:36
what's the url to the stream?
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:01:51
yeah. you would need to let me enter what my purchase price for btc was.
i think short term is 43% tax.
@_date: 2014-02-05 02:42:13
btc-e i like over bitstamp.
@_date: 2014-12-24 04:08:54

you can already use it today w/ transpilers.

depends on what you're trading.
@_date: 2014-02-03 00:12:20
can't withdraw fiat or bitcoin right now. they have a lot of problems, plus they are about 10% higher than anybody else.
btc-e.com is free to register, if you want something in the US try Bistamp.

@_date: 2014-11-24 09:20:28
ok, 0.00000001 -- is that 1/1 million or 1/100millionth?
Also, I thought Bit and Satoshi were the same thing.
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:23:17
you can use their keys on multibit. i think its pretty safe to say they will shutdown soon. they have stated if 'any scary men in costumes' come knockin' they will shutdown their service rather than give up their customers information to feds. I personally don't believe them, but its going to happen sooner or later.
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:00:09
I remember when Bitcoin would not produce any results in Google News. For a week straight.
@_date: 2014-04-03 04:24:26
i can't find shit about it. did a custom date range search even.
@_date: 2014-02-03 05:55:02
Yeah....well its early. Maybe VISA will use Bitcoin under the hood...and just provide an easy interface. Something Bitcoin is sorely lacking.
@_date: 2014-10-18 06:47:38
holy christ. can you change that god awful font?
@_date: 2014-10-18 04:12:22
Dude, this market is tanking this past couple of months.
I'm pretty much writing off retirement.
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:13:53
naah. she would just spend it all like she does now w/ fiat.
@_date: 2014-04-08 18:43:23
I wouldn't be surprised either. Free market problems require free market solutions. Getting whacked is one of those solutions.
@_date: 2014-07-05 21:23:34
We know he paid $18m for 30k coins. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:15:41
I lost faith in it when they didn't raise the 50k needed for NASCAR ad in 17 hours.
@_date: 2014-01-31 05:21:51
damn, no site yet.
@_date: 2014-02-04 06:53:37
@_date: 2014-04-06 22:19:56
i havne't seen any 'freeeeee btc' or 'l0st 82oooo btc' posts lately.
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:01:40
Right. They can implement w/ BitPay in 2 days but their support staff will take 6 months to understand it.
I wouldn't buy anything from any online retailer w/ Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:22:26
he drinks lattes from starbucks. that is supposed to be hilarious apparently.
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:32:34
yup. 800, then 900, then 1000, then 1200. The mark will gox us all again by announcing verification id database was hacked.
@_date: 2014-02-04 06:05:31
why, what happens 2/15?
@_date: 2014-03-01 05:00:12
claim incompetence. declare bankruptcy. holds 750k bitcoin.
just wait for storm to blow over. sounds like mtgox is a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:10:20
Not sure what regulations you're talking about. They are not US based.
@_date: 2014-08-17 09:58:08
how many videos are there?
@_date: 2014-07-23 05:33:02
bail out when they ask for payment, they'll give you half price a few days later. I think it was $36 for 6 months.
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:08:30
damn dude. that's awesome. too bad i can't hear what you're saying.
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:24:28
Its about to get real up in here. Overnight they made criminals out of Bitcoin users.
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:58:21
Blockchain tech can be used for all kinds of things that normally would require 3rd parties. This is what is exciting and will empower people. The only hurdle I see is waking up the sheep out of their slumber. Its like the Matrix. So many people are too far gone that its not worth waking them up.
@_date: 2014-06-02 07:36:15
I think he's just pissed you aren't taking him to Barbados with you.
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:53:46
That's messed up. You think that's why?
@_date: 2014-10-29 06:53:18
i wish you would have told me i was playing with real coins. I didn't know that nor did I know the rules.
@_date: 2014-10-06 19:36:54
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:22:33
I've been to Africa and I don't believe for 1 second the poor people there will start using Bitcoin. Whoever is spreading that bullshit needs to stop.
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:13:10
naah. i don't even bother anymore. their loss.
@_date: 2014-12-20 04:23:45
it went fro 304 to 323 in just 2 days.
@_date: 2014-01-14 06:29:13
true dat. especially after they attempted a 51% attack!
@_date: 2014-09-22 05:46:22
yeah, that's true. maybe its time for coinbase to step up.
@_date: 2014-11-25 05:22:52
Here's the video where it gets stolen. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 06:07:06
i'm waiting for 279. i think this christmas is going to be a bust.
@_date: 2014-02-02 06:27:15
Trojan, Virus, any number of ways.
@_date: 2014-03-09 06:00:58
well it looks like the site is down now:
But they had a list of the number of coins owned and what percentage of Bitcoin users had that number of coins in their position. If you had 1 BTC you were in the top .35%.
Pretty amazing. Most people didn't know about Bitcoin until a few months ago when it hit 1200. Which made it too expensive to buy a full bitcoin for most people.
@_date: 2014-02-01 04:24:11
ripple?! wtf. don't put your money in that shit.
@_date: 2014-08-03 03:27:21
suckers will still pay. Look at godaddy.
@_date: 2014-01-19 06:53:57
he's been deleted. so no.
@_date: 2014-03-18 19:05:02
there have been reports of slow transactions for weeks. when they do come back up, i would move off bci.
@_date: 2014-07-31 03:58:59
You dad sounds like a cool guy. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:30:18
I blame the fact that he wasn't using node.js

@_date: 2014-11-24 09:03:57
are you sure about that?
@_date: 2014-11-13 04:57:47
sounds about right.
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:40:46
...aaaaand its gone!

I can't wait for Bitcoin to overthrow these rediculous government bodies and make them obsolete.
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:30:47
the bitcoin devs were actually encouraging these altcoin generators. i wondered "why would they ever want that....it would just flood the market with useless....oh, nevermind"
@_date: 2014-07-08 04:03:12
This looks pretty cool. Kind of scary that only 2 employees though.
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:56:48
how do you mean loans can't happen? there's already microlending sites setup to do loans.

not my fortay, but good luck.
@_date: 2014-12-22 08:08:17
you don't sound like bitcon material son.  you're making too much sense. maybe we should band together.
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:00:34
i'm not sure i like the brain wallet idea. you need to pick a memorable phrase, and there are probably collections of these already in existence for brute force attacks.
interesting experiment though. kudos.
@_date: 2014-01-28 17:43:28
i know, did he just say Facebook could be the KYC provider? and mention a "global identity number"? Who the fuck is this guy? Bilderberg?
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:18:47
This is some serious fucked up shit. Its like arresting someone for having a poppy sticker on their suitecase. Because you know, Poppies can be used to make methanphetamines or something.

why you say dis? such somberness.

That's why its political. *Because* we have families to feed and *want* Bitcoin to provide for us.
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:17:45
The trick is not to invest more than you're willing to lose. When the price was $1200/coin it was tempting, But I knew that in 5-10 years it maybe $100k/coin. That is what keeps me from spending them now.
If I do spend, I replace them right away.
@_date: 2014-08-03 02:31:44

Its a cool wallet design. But put some*thing* not some*one* on it.
@_date: 2014-12-17 11:07:03
...its not a question of if, but when.
@_date: 2014-03-04 06:09:37
There is a lot of regulation that goes into this. I doubt it.
@_date: 2014-10-29 07:05:49
well, hopefully its not *all* your wealth you're putting into bitcoin, although from the looks of the place I doubt it is.

Personally I don't know how she did it w/o a man.

@_date: 2014-02-08 22:39:33
you're doing it wrong.
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:35:16

I think it is a problem never before seen. Government is the last entity you want making decisions about its future.
We are lucky to even have the internet...if it were developed post 9/11 you can bet it would be Internet (tm).

@_date: 2014-03-20 07:34:42

 -- "the other 6b will be using Bitcoin"
fuck off w/ that shit.
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:19:18
that's bitcoin. unless you believe it will 10k someday, don't invest.
@_date: 2014-08-05 03:34:32
Nope. lots of us think that :)

they said they have the ID database....and i read somewhere they are selling it. So don't think your data is safe.
@_date: 2014-03-08 05:50:04
That's like saying they created it to bankrupt democrats.
Anyone with half a brain would not be investing the farm.

wow. this was distributed by the same people that hacked Mark's blog?
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:43:40
i'm done w/ bitcoin for awhile.
@_date: 2014-12-28 09:02:12
depends. to do it yourself you really need to know what you're doing. I don't trust myself not to fuck it up.
So I use a desktop wallet like electrum or multibit, backup the keys and encrypt using gpg and store in remote location. I use an incredibly simple password that I know I won't forget.
@_date: 2014-11-17 01:35:44

Not really a vpn, but gets you around a lot of blackout restrictions (and is better than a vpn in that sense).  they accept bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-01-31 04:24:14
domain squatters missed the boat. 800 bitcoin domains. assuming he paid $8 each that's $6,400 he could have dumped into bitcoins instead and come out *way* ahead. Nobody will buy this crap. Maybe bitcoin.com could be worth some money, but not this shit he registered.
Anyway, people are waiting for new top level glds to come out.
@_date: 2014-02-01 22:27:23
i don't know. with all the news lately, i would have expected it to be at 2500 by now. Now I'm not sure, maybe this is a dud.
@_date: 2014-09-21 02:44:37
i don't understand the bet. is it saying bitcoin will be worth more than 195k?
@_date: 2014-02-02 03:29:06
That is a cool song. I have this one as my ring tone:

@_date: 2014-02-19 03:54:48

@_date: 2014-02-28 07:57:08
nope. that's the smart way to invest. Buy the dips, a little bit at a time. Gone are the days where you could drop $100 and have 5,000 btc.

@_date: 2014-04-10 04:23:06
i doubt anyone will sell you btc via paypal.

yeah. they are pros. bad guys too. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 06:39:55
This looks cool. but i could not figure out how to run it.
@_date: 2014-11-25 09:38:33
for now its the only incentive, there are already other products being developed using blockchain technology that have nothing to do with Bitcoin.
 is one that comes to mind.
@_date: 2014-02-01 23:14:49
you just run a program that will download chunks of data and try to break the encryption on it. if you succeed, you get a reward, usually a number of coins. This is how they are created and are so called "mining".
@_date: 2014-02-11 05:04:32

i'd advise against using anything you posted on the Internet or that someone may have access to as a seed for a private key. You may as well just use his birthday and name as the password if you're going to be that stupid.

@_date: 2014-04-08 04:34:00
if you buy something with bitcoin, chances are merchant will have your address and record of the transaction. Unless you're dealing in the blackmarket, these tools will be of little use.

You can make money laundering illegal w/o controlling Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-05 03:32:13
what, cash? or wealth.
@_date: 2014-03-22 22:12:49
This is why its like a ponzi. so much attempt to convince people they need to use it. If it was good people wouldn't have to be forced to use it, they would naturally flow to it because it fills a need.
@_date: 2014-08-06 23:00:35
I tip the D.
@_date: 2014-07-03 05:38:26

You forgot...."and then they get hacked, getting his identity stolen"
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:52:28
I think he just sees someone else getting attacked by media and wants to put the focus back on himself.
@_date: 2014-03-20 06:17:13
I don't think "the other 6B" is really looking at crypto currencies right now. They are trying to figure out where to get water and food.
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:01:22
you do understand if bitcoin hits 100k, there's basically no government to pay taxes to, right?
@_date: 2014-07-19 18:12:01
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:53:28

obviously you do care. you keep replying.
@_date: 2014-11-25 06:02:32

It must be pretty crazy. The stream I'm watching seems pretty tame.
@_date: 2014-05-10 23:41:39
....and litecoin.
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:33:28
is it too late to buy them on havelock do you think?
@_date: 2014-03-10 04:43:46
Same problem. 2.0.
@_date: 2014-03-25 02:48:02
and got that shady memory dealer guy to read a statement.
@_date: 2014-09-19 03:18:28
meetup definitely the standard here, they have the people who would become your members.
Trick: if you start the registration/meetup creation process then bail out on the order form, they will send you an email 2 days later for 50% off. Best thing is to find a co-founder host, so you can split the cost. Its like $5/month if you do that.
@_date: 2014-01-31 05:54:14
why are you posting a fucking landing page?

i would hire an expert to teach me how to do a paper/hardware/offline/cold/storage/brain wallet if it goes that high.
@_date: 2014-01-18 17:19:53
i wonder why companies that made pick axes and shovels decided to not dig with their shovels before selling them to the public.
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:30:07
heh. it was a joke. like you're into "fisting bananas".
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:00:54
i don't think our numbers are that strong. Anyone who was on the fence, which is a much larger number than any current users are probably going to avoid it now that this guidance came out.
@_date: 2014-11-25 06:00:52
yeah, that would be good. donate to the businesses who suffered damage.
@_date: 2014-08-11 02:36:57
congratulations. you will be in the top 1% soon.
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:01:24
@_date: 2014-02-09 05:59:53
yeah. i tend to agree.
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:04:39
ok. maybe someone has a raw copy.
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:10:23
which one?
@_date: 2014-07-08 04:37:56
its come to that hasn't it?
@_date: 2014-07-06 00:34:06
Bit of a fail, no bitcoin logo. Just some QR code. Is that intentional? I thought there was supposed to be a logo too.
@_date: 2014-02-13 09:18:45
 you know in photoshop i came remove those white blocks and see your original numbers, right?
@_date: 2014-07-05 23:03:44
Confirmed, just got access to server.
I wouldn't store any keys on it, but if you want a free sandbox for a project, this is perfect.
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:44:55
I am expecting it. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 00:01:26
maybe a paperclip...incase you need to bust out of handcuffs.
@_date: 2014-08-03 18:59:19
Yes. I know. He just thought Bitcoin was ponzi scheme and used by drug dealers and terrorists...."....now Google wallet....I would *trust* that. I'm going to fund that one!"
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:28:52
they are only doing this to ensure we stop paying taxes.
@_date: 2014-07-11 04:43:03
They've been saying that for about a year and half now.
@_date: 2014-07-07 03:25:12
Cool....are you there for the World Cup? Or is that over. We don't watch futbol here.
@_date: 2014-01-14 06:20:11
There's no statute of limitations on tax evasion. So be careful what you say and do. This very post could be used against you.
Totally understand what you're asking though. No taxation w/o representation. To bad that went out the windows long ago.
@_date: 2014-04-03 19:42:40
yes. it seems. i'm still living paycheck to paycheck. Back then I was rich.
@_date: 2014-10-06 06:45:50
Its' Apple! They are driving down Bitcoin so people start using Apple Pay.

@_date: 2014-01-27 05:22:43
hopefully you recognize them :)
@_date: 2014-08-17 00:04:50
how do i do that?
@_date: 2014-07-08 16:43:16
Bitcoin is just math.
@_date: 2014-12-14 03:05:11
naah, it was something else.
@_date: 2014-01-23 03:37:44
my thoughts exactly.
@_date: 2014-09-22 04:08:17
@_date: 2014-07-16 01:59:24


So which one is it?
@_date: 2014-02-01 18:42:43
Charlie Lee, CEO of Litecoin, testified at NYDFS hearings this past tuesday.
I love how they just randomly pick people and hold them responsible. I bet a lot of people reading this story now think Bitcoin is dead, because their CEO has been arrested. Well done, media, well done.
@_date: 2014-05-05 07:35:56
@_date: 2014-02-06 07:40:04
people will still come back if they do that. i'm not saying they should.
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:50:48
those hackers you are friendly with stole everyone's passports and are selling the db.
@_date: 2014-12-21 03:26:25
i'm buying in at 279.
@_date: 2014-02-18 23:23:38
damn news.
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:36:09
ROFL. Back to basics.
@_date: 2014-11-25 05:26:45
I read a few weeks ago that a $10 bill from 2002 is worth about 85 cents now.
@_date: 2014-09-24 06:20:12
I bought at the peak again :)
I *always* buy at the peak.
@_date: 2014-11-21 23:08:23
Is that $10 dollars?
@_date: 2014-04-03 04:35:20
what was there before telnet? because that's what Bitcoin is.

@_date: 2014-03-25 19:28:26
This isn't the last time we'll hear about it either. Just wait until one of those ATMs get hacked that require palm print + retina scan.
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:16:01
The entire thing is a fucking joke man.
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:48:22
ATMs all require palm scanning. I don't know who would ever do this, they are just asking to be audited next year.
@_date: 2014-03-31 03:20:20
yeah right. you're promoting drugs aren't you? that girl w/ the pink hair in the video definitely was high after consuming that "tea".
@_date: 2014-11-25 07:58:59
think of blockchain like the browser and bitcoin like netscape.
the browser will always be around, but netscape may disappear.
@_date: 2014-02-09 05:31:10
still down.
@_date: 2014-10-18 05:46:07
You're not supposed to tell foreigners you're completely ok with this.
@_date: 2014-05-12 07:24:53
checkout doesn't offer bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:03:42
You've got the right mindset for Bitcoin adoption. It is freedom in its most raw form. You control your own money. That is freedom.
My only advice is don't bet the farm. I already said it once, but it could be worthless or hacked down the road and be worth nothing. I've only put a small amount of my wealth into it....I'm hoping that never happens...but there's always a risk. Hate for you to invest everything and lose it somehow on my suggestion.
@_date: 2014-03-23 17:23:20
there's a good stolen phone site on the darkweb. I would try there.
@_date: 2014-02-09 00:55:06
where do you think it will go?
@_date: 2014-08-17 08:18:28
@_date: 2014-11-04 05:46:42
That is why I never bother reading ToS....because they *all* include this clause. So after reading all that bullshit legal gibberish, at the very end they say, "We can do what we want when we want without your permission".
@_date: 2014-02-02 06:46:57
I forgot to add "Lasers and Sex"
@_date: 2014-12-29 02:48:02
so bitcoin ponzi works!
@_date: 2014-07-26 10:49:27
So this isn't even possible?
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:20:16
satoshi may be an alien.
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:12:20
They don't want the world to adapt to bitcoin. They want bitcoin to adapt to the world.

Because we all have the right not be watched by big brother.
@_date: 2014-03-27 01:04:32
how could Yahoo mention a bank run and not mention Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-11-28 08:33:36
Coinbase publishes your fucking name and phone number online for anybody to scrape. Shiiiiiit. None of these companies are secure if you ask me.
@_date: 2014-03-26 00:44:57
haha. so effectively if you were an early adopter you would have donated more than you made. I guess that poor bastard who bought the pizza for 10,000 Bitcoins is getting fucked up the ass by IRS right now seeing as how its 9 million dollar pizza.
@_date: 2014-11-25 04:45:57
so like a western union for bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-27 04:58:10


@_date: 2014-04-02 03:59:50
I started talking about it at work a year ago when I bought some. People just laughed and called it a ponzi scheme. After it went to 1200 they started asking me how to invest. Now that its at 500 they keep asking me when it'll go back up. I should have just kept my mouth shut.
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:03:16
@_date: 2014-05-28 04:13:31
Bitstamp could take it to $200 in a few minutes if they got hacked.
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:25:35
I would not trust anything but In Person.
@_date: 2014-02-03 06:29:33
i never said it was a good commercial. I imagine a Bitcoin Baron doing something that stupid with Bitcoin commercial.
@_date: 2014-11-27 04:59:35
or you could buy a hell of a lot more doge. Now that Ken Hess has spoken, I think that's the nail in the coffin for Bitcoin.
Obviously this guy is legit. Just look at his site, speaks volumes:

Yup. This idiot thought bitcoin was invented by the illuminati to enslave us.

i would use cryptsy or btc-e

@_date: 2014-03-23 16:39:52
lets say i was able to get paid in BTC (I can't, but lets' say I could). I still have to hassle with the wallet setup/storage. And since I'm on an iPhone, I have to bring my laptop everywhere to make a payment. And if I screw it up, copy/paste wrong payment address there's no recovery of funds
@_date: 2014-10-18 05:56:34
I'm mostly in 401k and mutual funds. I gave up on stocks after selling to early or too late.

Ever since the collapse of Coinbase, and arrest of Benjamin Lawsky, bitcoin price has been steadily growing at 1000%/month
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:06:49
i see. i guess that clears it up. sounds like most of bitcoin solutions....too dumb to do it right.
@_date: 2014-10-18 07:15:19
nope. it was not predictable. and I'm too risk-adverse to start selling the few I have to buy in lower. What if it doesn't go lower?
@_date: 2014-03-16 03:58:15
how did you acquire the btc?

@_date: 2014-03-12 02:27:35
Yeah. It is susceptible to human error with no recourse. But I think it will get easier to use. Right now I'm more concerned with security if the private key. That being said if the transaction is problematic you can still work with the merchant to resolve the issue.

@_date: 2014-02-20 02:56:34
oh yeah. that's old. $10k for 3Th/s now from KNC.
I still don't think its a winner though, by the time you get it.
Best you can do is mine an altcoin or sell it while you can still get some cash for it. The 550Gh/s miners were going on eBay for $16k last I checked.

@_date: 2014-01-27 03:17:03
it is. the javascript code that does all the encryption has to be trusted that it wasn't compromised at the server. There was a thief who stole some coins from a charity or something and moved them to strongcoin.com -- same principle javascript encryption.
So what happened was the strongcoin administrators just added a function to steal the coins back once the thief logged in. This is why LavaBit decided to shut down its service instead of comply because FBI was forcing them to compromise the javascript for their users w/o a court order.
@_date: 2014-08-17 07:02:27

it would be cool if the backdrop was something like this:
This code is nothing related to bitcoin, but I bet someone here could find a cool looking block of code from the bitcon project in a python editor and paste it here.

bitcoin is poised to make nothing obsolete.
@_date: 2014-02-02 22:58:47
typicall if you put a buy price higher than the ask price, it gives you the best available price, so even though you said "buy 1 BTC @ $800" it would actually buy it at $700.
but not every exchange is honest.
@_date: 2014-02-09 06:32:54
I don't think so.
@_date: 2014-07-27 03:39:14

I think by the time search volume increased, the bitcoiners in the know already saw a crash coming. I don't think search results was a predictor of a crash I think it was a result of a crash.

use multibit. no need to download blockchain.
@_date: 2014-07-05 02:46:57
Yeah. Well I don't use it. and I have no money there. I do not use sites that require 2FA for the simple reason I may not have both devices handy at any given moment. I was able to withdraw without it.

Wow, they even ask when you pay now. Its the end. We need more payment processors outside the US.
@_date: 2014-02-13 09:38:54
they would have the original format.
checkout bitaddress.org or a few other brain wallet/paper wallet generators. They use random mouse movements as the seed because it's pretty much guaranteed that nobody can reproduce those. But even then people say that is insecure for screen loggers or something.

That's not always an option. I'm at the fastest speed I can afford and it takes a few days at today's blockchain size. Also, I'm on a laptop....hd size is not so easy to just "buy a new one" that will fit.

@_date: 2014-03-10 02:31:57
Yeah. I remember broadcast.com. First to market, and then sold to Yahoo. Yahoo tends to fuck things up. Just look at their track record with purchased companies.
Things change fast too...so if someone were to do a full rewrite of the blockchain solution we could have something way better. I suspect that's what a Google or a PayPal would do.
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:23:30
When I read drivel from trolls like you I laugh.
@_date: 2014-03-26 15:38:43
this new tax guidance makes me think Bitcoin was an NWO creation.

it will be the very *last* thing to happen.

in 2015 we'll read "Andreesen Horowitz files for chapter 11 investing in Bitcoin".
@_date: 2014-11-17 06:17:44
That's normal. Most people think you have to go through all the hurdles to convert fiat to bitcoin.
Just download a wallet (multibit, electrum or one of the others online ones - blockchain.info is probably the best). They are all free.
Just remember to backup your keys in a remote location so if your HD crashes you can restore your wallet.
@_date: 2014-03-14 02:20:52
they were spot on for me. put me in Telecom and Enron.
@_date: 2014-08-06 04:54:42
Anybody who is in favor of regulation does not understand Bitcoin. The entire reason for its creation was to circumvent exactly this sort of thing.
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:37:47
no. i would not. its deflationary that's one of the aspects i like about it. if you want lots of coins, use dogecoin.
@_date: 2014-01-27 03:06:03
Fuck gox. incompetence across all levels.
@_date: 2014-03-04 05:06:14
This is what I love about Bitcoin.
Within 2-3 days there is a solution already to market. Try doing that when you have to jump through hoops of regulatory compliance.

Lawsky's License: 
Most people missed it here. but he states that its now a crime to release open source software in his "ruling". Just go find the ruling text. Should be every other thread here.
Basically Satoshi Nakamoto has 45 days to comply or he's a criminal. Guy was smart to cover his tracks. I thought it would get bad for Bitcoin, but I didn't think they'd attack open source.

So if we're using correct timeline as an analogy, Bitcoin is about 1974 in Internet time. Since aarpanet was 1969.

Download a desktop wallet, aquire some bits to play with (like $10 worth) so if you fuck up and loose it or whatever you aren't out your entire investment. Best way to learn it is to use it.
You can send any fraction of 1 BTC up to 100 million units. I think the fee is 2 cents or something, no matter whether you're sending .0000001 USD or 50M USD.
I recommend electrum wallet to start (avoid downloading the 24GB blockchain, it will just confuse you and make you give up).

its ironic MS users are the first to use bitcoin....since they (by definition) are not technical in any way, shape or form.
@_date: 2014-11-20 11:02:14
So their state (or unstated depending on who you ask) is to build side chains pegged to fiat currencies so that governments can start using the blockchain and peg value to their fiat currencies. At least according to this person, this is their intent...go after governments as their target market. So I can only imagine this is not the intent Satoshi had in mind. Their will likely be all the same restrictions and compliance issues you're used to dealing with banks and credit cards.

Only invest what you're willing to lose. Its a gamble at this point. Could be hacked, one of the many single points of failure could send the price into a nose dive (ie: Bitstamp crashing).

its better to use new address for each transaction. More difficult to tie the address (and its history) to you.
I find it a bit overkill for personal use, so I generally setup a new address for each service that I send/receive bitcoin to/from. Like I'll create a new address for an exchange.

I don't know if they can filter the packets or not. If they block ports I would assume you could just change the port.
If they block packets, you could use a proxy (like Tor).

"soon" my ass. I just upgraded from 12Mbit/second to 24Mbit/second. They claim "100Mbit/second" is coming soon, but that will be an ass raping I'm not willing to pay. And will still be capped at 1.5Mb/s up I'm sure (to combat terrorism).
When I first got road runner, back in 1997 i think it was around 3-5Mb/s for about $40/month. Now I"m paying $65/month for 24Mb/s.

do they have bitcoin meetups in your city?
@_date: 2014-08-06 03:05:48
certainly its possible. in fact probable.
But what you really need is to offer incentive to keep it going. I would happily dedicate a server to index web sites and host results if I got some kind of crypto currency reward for doing that.
@_date: 2014-11-17 00:28:00
he released it as open source and paper well in advance. you could have taken part if you were there. but you weren't. your loss. not his.
@_date: 2014-11-17 06:10:31
i see. its too bad full nodes can't mine. although I suppose if as OP asks, if everyone stopped mining, we could go back to CPU mining again.
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:52:18
That sucks. They should refund you the money. The gyft CEO is this guy:  and he is pro-bitcoin, so maybe he'll help you out.

1 individual owns 1 million coins, and there are other large wallets besides that one. That is close to 10% of the 12 mill. in circulation.
If bitcoin ever does get beyond the hobbyist/garage days phase...and into a global currency contenting with the dollar this *WILL* be an issue.
Could you imagine if 1 person owned 10% of the USD?

i don't think he was trafficking drugs at all. At least I never read that about him. He did do some gray market deals with someone reselling his Bitcoins on SR. But what someone does with their money after you give it to them is outside your control. Shrem should have done the right thing and reported him, but this kind of shit goes unnoticed on wallstreet all day every day.
The problem I have is Lawsky was using him for the better part of a year talking to him weekly trying to understand Bitcoin...and what did he do for thanks to Shrem? The day before Lawsky's hearings he made a big media circus and had him arrested to drum up publicity for his hearings and how we need regulation. Fuck that guy. He can take his regulations and misconceptions of Bitcoin and shove 'em up his ass.

Also, how many bitcoin users are there in Chicago that read the SunTimes? The test only went for a week if I'm not mistaken. $50 doesn't sound like much, but the sweet spot was 25 cents. which used to be the price of a newspaper. Pay 25 cents for full access to the site for 24 hours. It seems like a promising business model.

In all honesty, the reason I'm not a millionaire right now is because I was going to put $1000 into Bitcoin 3 years ago, and went to mtgox.com and thought, "wtf is this shit? looks shady as hell...."
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:56:24
i think its actually illegal. Since you can't print your own money. that's why the casacious coins guy got shut down.

Yeah. he will make maybe 20% of his investment back. But its pretty much gone. I've been day trading alts for the past year in small amounts. I think I invested about $100 total and lost most of it. Its just a huge risk and a gamble to boot.

I doubt it. First, they would have to identify the wallet's owner. Then identify the owner. And if it was $100k there would be a lot bigger fish to go after, and that means USD has collapsed anyway, so probably not going to happen.

you raising all kinds of flags w/ 50k transaction. no, you can't do localbitcoins for 50k transactions either. i guess you're just fucked paying 43% tax.

@_date: 2014-03-14 07:02:14
you have cracked the bitcoin code.
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:01:49
Exactly my thoughts. Just "I use Bitcoin" is better. No need to gloat. We already know what it means to use Bitcoin.

regulation doesn't do shit, except for keep small players out and control in the hands of the big players. You also don't understand bitcoin if you think everyone has to accept a protocol change.

the wealth discrepency offered by bitcoin is going to be worse than the world has ever seen. 10% of all money in circulation is owned by 1 person.
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:24:28
how do you produce readable code like that?
@_date: 2014-08-09 23:20:50
Sure just make sure you export the keys on your old computer before you destroy it. Then you can import those keys into the wallet software on your new computer. This will allow you to take control of the account and your history will be downloaded from the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-11-17 04:42:30
Do it on a regular exchange, in small intervals.

Most of them do not want to be speculators, they just want their fiat right away. Bitpay and coinbase allow you do either hold btc or cashout to fiat.
as more vendors accept bitcoin I expect this to change. they will then spend their btc with the suppliers.

so if each satoshi were 1 cent....that would mean BTC is worth 1 million?
so wtf is a bit again? 1000 satoshis?

wtf, you're helping the community. amazing people would have a problem with this.

on localbitcoins? becaue it takes too long.
@_date: 2014-08-17 06:55:42
They probably see you as high risk. Like they said.
People fear what they do not understand. As do lawyers at big corporate banks.

oh yeah. i also remember reading about rainbow tables. You can now basically google the MD5 and get the value if it was a common word.

don't worry, i have a wife.

Nice. I mention it at businesses. Its funny the look I get. I mentioned it at a restaurant while on vacation and the guy was like "Oh, bitcoms. Yeah, that's the thing the government doesn't like...."
"I said, well they can't enforce a tax on it...or control it, so yeah."
@_date: 2014-10-06 05:45:34
Dude. Do you not read the posts in here? Do not invest more than you can afford to lose. Its like some guy on the corner street holding a sign that says "co-founder, will give you shares for money". Sure, maybe you give him $20 or even $200. Or $2000. But do you give him the family fortune? C'mon now. This is just an experiment.
The only bit of advice I can tell you is to tell your siblings and tell them your thought process. You can use examples, like "this could be the biggest thing since the Internet. Imagine if we put $100k in domain names back in 1993".
That's the analogy I use. But I doubt anyone will tell you to keep it in -- I would tell you get the money out now while you still can.

The possibility that someone created Bitcoin is what amazes me. Thinking this far ahead he has proved he is capable of.
@_date: 2014-10-24 05:31:33

This seems like more of a wallet for your users. I don't want to provide wallets to users, I just want my own merchant wallet on the server to generate a random payment address on. The user would have to use their own wallet to send the payment from.

Trace Mayer seems to think if 1% of offshore tax haven money makes it into Bitcoin, the price will be 2.8 million USD per Bitcoin. I think that's a stretch...but you don't know.

I've been doing this awhile (promoting Bitcoin to friends/family/coworkers)...the first question I always get is "Why not just use the dollar" .... then it immediately becomes a political discussion because you have to explain the difference in monetary policy between Bitcoin and USD.

First Bitcoin ATM of what? Why do I keep reading post after post about the "first" bitcoin atm?
@_date: 2014-11-16 21:59:07
yeah same as before. nobody cares.
@_date: 2014-11-25 06:01:13
haha. yeah. i'm not rioting yet...yet...
@_date: 2014-12-28 06:53:40
go to a local meetup. pay in cash. 
tumble it.
@_date: 2014-02-02 03:55:13
yeah. i've wondered how long it will take for someone to recognize my ringtone. Unless it goes off at the local bitcoin meetup, probably forever.

i believe this is what transactions are supposed to solve? i hear you on the competency issue. if they've never worked on a balance before, they probably shouldn't be running an exchange.
@_date: 2014-08-04 06:11:49
I've lost 80-90% in the stock market. I have a strong stomach for it. 50% is nothing if you believe in it long term.
@_date: 2014-01-31 08:02:30
dotcom bubble had a lot of air, companies going public with no product or business model. I think bitcoin is real, is already in use, and just has to get wide spread adoption through ease of use.
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:32:16
1 bitcoin.

yeah. its a long way off from being anything useful to anyone.

lol. coindesk is like the bitcoin sewing circle.
@_date: 2014-07-01 23:45:02
I have to say the guy has a point. I didn't buy Bitcoin back in 2010 because it spent 2 weeks on my mac trying to download the blockchain. So I gave up. Even now, I cannot download that thing at 21GB. Thank god for multibit.org.
@_date: 2014-02-09 06:00:30
They also ban gays. Do you think that stops gays?
@_date: 2014-08-15 03:34:35

@_date: 2014-02-03 04:44:09
No. but talking the politics behind bitcoin is one of its key features. You're saying we should ignore its purpose for existing.
@_date: 2014-10-01 12:09:15
and terrorists and the children. don't forget the children.
@_date: 2014-02-19 03:52:25
thanks. but i only see a conversion calculator when i swipe up.
@_date: 2014-04-01 04:06:36
That's what i thought. same colors too.
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:29:58
depends on who you ask. i would say no.
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:55:23
this is a perfect example of why we should NOT be required to validate. All the state is doing is ensuring that our identities get stolen.
@_date: 2014-11-17 01:58:17

I did read somewhere you need at least 1 BTC though. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 03:17:45

i just give up if they show no interest and are not open minded. Their loss. Eventually they will be using bitcoin anyway, but 1 milibit will be 10k.
@_date: 2014-07-07 03:31:23

I was referring to this:


Mark Zuckerberg was able to build Facebook because the web was free and open. But he hasn't returned the compliment: his creation is not a platform from which young innovators can freely spring the next set of surprises. The same holds for most of the others who have built fortunes from exploiting the facilities offered by the web. The only real exception is Wikipedia.

My first Bitcoin transaction was liberating as well.
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:34:18
i like multibit. be sure to backup your keys somewhere safe.
if you can download bitcoin-qt, use armory. I could not get bitcoin-qt to work on mac.
@_date: 2014-12-16 02:34:48
And Facebook?
@_date: 2014-08-03 03:59:57
a lot of companies don't announce until they are ready.
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:22:21
its not any more scarce, but there are more demand, then price will go up, as it is in short supply. That's why I think it can go to 10k.

Don't waste your time. Install multibit (

There are several. Cgminer is one of them. It's like brute forcing
@_date: 2014-10-06 05:49:11
Even if price goes up its still "manipulation".
@_date: 2014-04-02 04:23:19
this is in the future. But how many credit card transactions are there every 10 minutes worldwide? (hint: there are 10k/second world wide right now, so that's about 6,000,000 every 10 minutes). If bitcoin captures just 1% of that volume, then it would be 100k/block. This may not be for a few years...but its certainly within reason.

There's also this one:
But if she wants to convert to USD right away, this won't work. She'll have to transfer the BTC to coinbase and sell it there. But it *does* give her a way to accept BTC w/o apple's approval.
@_date: 2014-08-10 05:50:02
What time frame are we talking here?
I think a lot of companies are waiting to see returns from the big companies who have already implemented it. And it seems that most of these companies are only accepting Bitcoin in the US. Probably a limitation of coinbase or bitpay.

Its quite easy.
1. goto bitcoin.meetup.com or localbitcoins.com
2. find a local meetup (or person) near you
3. buy some btc for cash
4. send btc to btc-e.com
5. day trade
6. become rich

i think you hit some flags there buddy.
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:20:38
i have stayed out of mining because its still a pretty big risk that you may not make your investment back by the time you receive the miner.
You can of course drop 15k on an outdated 550Gh/s miner on eBay and really be left holding a bag.

@_date: 2014-08-11 05:09:18
no. never. it will be millions or bust. in 10 years time. I think it will probably get offshore tax haven market first. so that's maybe like 1-2 years away. once the wolves w/ all the money realize they can hide it in counter party wallet or something similar, they would be fools to not at least put some money there.

you need to find your coinbase wallet address and then goto btc-e and paste that into the withdrawal form.
test it first with a small amount. otherwise you could lose your money if you do it wrong.
@_date: 2014-10-06 07:52:21

I don't think its as easy to change as you think. Genie can't be put back in the bottle.
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:53:53
Does this do instant conversion to fiat or is it for those merchants who want to hold Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-11 07:22:14
its too new for that. once merchants start holding bitcoin and spending it with their suppliers, it will change. but its not going to happen over night. coinbase is just meeting the demands of the market and right now that is to price things in USD.

the more you save, the more you have.
@_date: 2014-08-02 16:56:54
The flip side is your bank should cover all loses. You won't get that from Bitcoin. If you fuck up and lose your private key, its over. But at least with Bitcoin you wouldn't have had to waste a saturday standing in line getting your money back :P
@_date: 2014-07-02 02:27:19
so time to vacate cryptsy now, since they are now a money transmitter.
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:08:16
i would generally avoid anything claiming you can buy/sell with paypal. PayPal has made that against their ToS.
@_date: 2014-02-08 19:22:35
deosn't work. click 'buyers' and  you still see sellers.
@_date: 2014-06-02 07:41:31
no. its not illegal here. but you are supposed to pay taxes i guess. so that would be illegal to due, since paying taxes is illegal by US law.

naah. bitcoin is losing out to doge. which is fine by me, i own way more doge than bitcoin :)

Let me guess....you voted for Obama?
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:14:53
I think its easier said then done. But I do think eventually we will have ways of identifying yourself authoritatively besides just a private key.
Whenever that happens (5 years from now maybe?) we should have the ability to retrieve lost keys if you go through the identification process. All systems have this. For Bitcoin not to have it as well, it would be a show stopper. I'm in agreement with what you're saying. But I don't think forking is the solution.

Boycotts never work. Unless its the US Government doing it.
When there is business reason to use Bitcoin, they will use Bitcoin. Overstock took a huge leap. I don't think people were nagging them to do it, it took a pioneering Libertarian/Austrian economics CEO to see the value in it.

I see. so multibit would ask me for my blockchain.info password then? I have not tried because I'm worried I will somehow fuck it up and lose my wallet already in multbit.

why does nobody get how rediculous this "guidance" is?
@_date: 2014-02-02 06:06:24
i agree with some of that video...but the other part of the story is that Edgar would gladly pay Simon $3, even as Simon's productivity goes up. No raises. And seeing how Edgar is the only employer in town (reality in most places)...he has no option to leave and go work for someone else.
@_date: 2014-10-25 20:19:38
It was pretty obvious they didn't know what they were doing when their API returns XML instead of json.

@_date: 2014-07-05 22:11:10
basically you can't. its a reason Bitcoin is fucked. Great if you're sending &gt; $1. But if you need to do microtransactions, then the fee is like 50%.

2FA scares me actually, because it seems you can lock yourself out of your account when situations like this arise.
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:57:37
haha. so true. i don't know why you're getting downvoted for stating the obvious.

1 mBTC is about 43 cents right now. Seems like a good time to buy some mBTC. Think about Bitcoin price in terms of 1 BTC is like thinking about buying a house in terms of acres.

For $10k you can get a miner that will probably be worthless by the time you get it.

When you think about it, 14 M coins in circulation....
Imagine if the world only had 14 M dollars in circulation. A penny would buy you at least a car, if not a house.
@_date: 2014-03-11 05:35:25
Meh. 1% if you're lucky on savings. But the hassle you go through to replace your spent BTC makes it not even worth the trouble.
@_date: 2014-02-10 00:44:39
i think large scale cloud mining will be the norm....and not worth a penny.

So I guess there are some things to consider. How good did the food taste compared to how bad the fart smelled? I would assume better food/worse smell would put me in a higher flatulance tax bracket.
Also, is farting in front of family a taxable event? Or only when out in public.
Does my fart tax liability change if I'm indoors vs. outdoors?
These are all pretty important questions to get answered before I fart again.

@_date: 2014-08-06 05:26:07
If you are worried the power elite will gain from it....then you *definitely* do *not* want them forming the regulations for it. Which is what regulations are, rules enforced on everyone else by the power elite. Except they work in excemptions for themselves. They control the politicians who form these regulatory bodies. They will tell you lies like its 'for consumer protection' and other nonsense to get the people to go along with it, but read the regulation close you will see it benefits only those in power.

@_date: 2014-03-10 03:01:04
they get to keep the fees.
the idea is that fees can still remain low, but because # of transactions per block goes up...the miners will eventually be earning more in fees than they ever did in the block reward.
At least that's what I've read.
@_date: 2014-06-03 05:43:19

I think its this bitwage.co site. Did they recently change their marketing material? The site I saw was blueish like this, but definitely made it obvious about the whole "HR thinks your just adding a bank account" concept.

its like funding your etrade account. You are waiting for a good time to buy or sell. But have to keep your funds there to avoid delays when the time is right.

That makes sense. If the rich are storing their Bitcoins, then there's less in circulation as well causing them to be worth more.

ok. sounds like its not a possibility then. I was under the impression the chance of an address collision is so astronomically low it wouldn't even increase across all blockchains to be considered a possiblity in our lifetime.

just get one bitcoin. don't do something stupid like mortgage your house to buy 100 of them.
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:55:58
No, the idea behind a distributed blockchain is what is important. Anyone can come along and implement a totally different version of this concept. In fact I think its more than likely going to be high tech companies that do it sooner or later once they see the need for it.
I don't think Bitcoin + Euthereum (built ontop of Bitcoin) is going to be the be-all-end-all.

Well said. In sick and tired of people forcing their ideologies on others. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 11:25:26
Not from what I understand....it basically won't change anything...but governments could issue digital coins pegged to their fiat value. Like a USDCoin of sorts for USD.
It may or may not effect bitcoin the currency...although I would speculate that if this actually did hit the market and was implemented around bitcoin side chains, then you could use bitcoin to transfer between currencies pegged to different fiats. *maybe*....or they just let it rot in the middle and work around it.

This i think will revolutionize how content is monetized: 
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:24:04
does it say "shibe" on that sign?

I recommend you try Bitcoin before you start influencing people with uninformed articles about it.
@_date: 2014-11-17 21:55:32
I need one for block.io
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:06:44
Not sure you understand how this works. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 01:05:07
I have new found respect for andreas now. He's calling them criminals.

@_date: 2014-01-26 04:26:15
i find it fascinating people actually spend BTC. Seeing as how its so damn difficult to acquire.
@_date: 2014-04-03 16:35:17
not according to that supposed "tax accountant" the other day who posted in here.
@_date: 2014-09-23 15:42:27
Totally disagree with that nonsense. An uneducated population is not going to help long run. We used to be  in education. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 02:03:34
Fuck it. I'd vote for ya. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 21:08:01
that's why everyone lies. are you some how saying I"m the only one who is saying Bitcoin is full of criminals?
@_date: 2014-11-17 01:32:50
no problem. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 18:45:49
sissy then?
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:18:33
i see what you're saying. well i don't know if you can sell to *anyone* -- not everyone wants one.
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:05:37
say hi to DPR for me.
@_date: 2014-07-05 18:16:34
Yes. I only talk about it when someone asks.

tell him it will overthrow the government and cause the next apocolypse. But that it also has low transaction fees for merchants.

Dogecoin is the coin for the masses. Bitcoin is for the elite.
@_date: 2014-04-06 03:35:07
isn't this like getting a "Thank you for interviewing" email and then getting all excited you got the job? Never to hear from them again.

"just get a bigger hd and faster internet!" so says pundits.
@_date: 2014-02-09 23:42:23
haha. "test it extensively" -- do you think that's really the reason for a 3-6 month delay on these ASICs?
@_date: 2014-08-17 07:53:12
You just got flagged by FBI.

I would support banning the use of Facebook.

@_date: 2014-07-05 02:59:39
i do the same thing. i have a bookmark link to my address on BC.i
@_date: 2014-03-16 05:51:26
i hate that 'freeee btc' guy.
@_date: 2014-01-26 04:46:52
well, its easy if you are in US, have a bank account, and can wait 7 days for them to arrive using coinbase. That's not "easy" in my book.
@_date: 2014-04-01 02:35:23
Op is saying you don't need to keep track of personal transactions. Like coffee. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 09:11:46
any idea how it happened?
@_date: 2014-11-27 04:40:57
i saw that video....i can't remember who the speaker was. It was some big hoity toity in early web days I think.
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:16:04
he spent 2 weeks using only bitcoin around december called "The 12 Days of Bitcoin".
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:16:11
Its possible some government is behind the multiple hackings. Its also possible incompetent people are trying to make a quick buck. There's no barrier to entry.
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:25:03
The "law" is there to protect the consumer. In this case its putting the consumer at risk.

This is actually good news!
@_date: 2014-02-02 08:05:43
@_date: 2014-03-20 05:53:52
"windows" and "wallets" should not be used together in same sentence.
@_date: 2014-07-20 06:33:33
I agree. But this is more libertarianish tendencies than bitcoin. Bitcoin was popular among criminals and then libertarians first. Most of those guys are assholes. Who knows what happened for that sales guy to respond that way, I'm sure it wasn't as simple as "Hey, what's that black  box do?" "Fuck you, here's a quarter".
As for these Bitcoin Barrons you mention, shrem, etc. They are operated in a legal gray area and got rich from it. Now gov is coming after them.
My friends and I always joked about that shady billboard on Lawrence Expressway for "Memory Dealers" that accepted Bitcoin. It was the only place Bitcoin was displayed publically up until recently. Turns out that is Roger Vers company.
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:33:42

oh god. i've heard andreas before. i'm not some fucking newb drinking koolaid.
@_date: 2014-02-01 04:53:40
yeah. its a race. which will come first...a decent wallet that is easy to use, safe, and secure, or a high price.
@_date: 2014-12-28 01:47:18
Piece of Shit (I think)
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:22:43
got a lot of people into crypto currencies who probably wouldn't have used it.
@_date: 2014-02-20 03:01:10
 is good, not an auction though. more of a craiglist.
@_date: 2014-03-08 08:30:58
Its pretty funny. I almost want it to escalate to see what else he does. If its really him he's a genius. If bitcoin is secure, there's no way to prove its him unless gov't ceased his computer and could produce evidence....which I'm sure he has long disposed of.

Anarchy just means spoils go to the guy with the biggest knife.

Yes, checkout Gridcoin.

@_date: 2014-11-22 07:17:01
such quality!
@_date: 2014-02-05 04:09:38
Fear mongering. THey always start it, "Well this a joke...but its here. What do you think of this so called 'Bitcoin'?
@_date: 2014-08-04 06:10:34
wow dude. use mintpal. neither is necesssary.
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:19:28
its pretty amazing that w/ so few people who know about Bitcoin, its still the largest computer network and computational power. It will be unstoppable when more people use it.
@_date: 2014-08-04 02:38:31
because you want regulation. why are you such an asshole?
@_date: 2014-10-24 05:43:14
Where else can I keep all my altcoins?

and our 2.5 amendment. The right to bare children.
@_date: 2014-09-24 06:19:49
Whether or not you like paypal, them test marketing Bitcoin is a step in the right direction. Sure they are just testing it for now...but if it does make it into their wallet, we will have several large enterprise level companies using Bitcoin. Hard for congress/lawsky to ignore this.
@_date: 2014-02-08 06:02:16
haha. i figured. Bitcoin @ BestBuy. you guys are dreamin'
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:42:47

lol. probably nothing.

Dude, you're thinking of Doge @_date: 2014-12-16 02:30:26
100 doge!
@_date: 2014-03-31 02:15:18
its a problem. just install bitcoin-qt and you will see.
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:56:06
so true. glad we have them to protect and to serve.
@_date: 2014-11-24 19:13:27
k thanks 1 bit
@_date: 2014-11-16 22:10:57
because its open source. if you don't like the changes, fork it implement your changes, and then get all the miners to use your version.
@_date: 2014-03-29 20:21:48
I don't think people should pay taxes unless they get to say where the money is spent.
@_date: 2014-12-26 18:52:26


@_date: 2014-03-16 00:22:56
easily replaced with a legitimate solution. Bitcoin is 99% amateur. Just wait until the Apples, Googles, and JP Morgans work on a similar technology.
@_date: 2014-04-02 05:25:16
It doesn't take much to keep the blockchain going. Why do you think people won't be mining?
@_date: 2014-07-26 22:25:32
Banks own the government. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 04:51:02
Thanks. I was going to do my report on Bitcoin as well. I'll just use yours.
@_date: 2014-02-02 07:38:08
Any idea what kind of ROI it generates?
@_date: 2014-01-31 07:12:13
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:17:28
Ok, bold guy....settle down. We're all equals here.
I think the only problem with what he is proposing is setting the price for the day. I don't like that. Bitcoin should evolve on its own.
@_date: 2014-11-17 01:28:34
21 million club. i like that.
@_date: 2014-07-11 04:38:38
Rock on. I want a shirt like that.
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:02:40
make a deal with the devil. what could go wrong?
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:51:27
ok, thanks.
@_date: 2014-12-20 07:46:24
nope. back in the 70s they were called 'shopping centers'
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:59:44
This is to sell. Not buy.

That is awesome. Where can I register to be an Ordained Blockchain Minister and perform Blockchain weddings?

if you're just paying for a cup of coffee, you don't need to wait.
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:40:45
because its personal info.
@_date: 2014-11-29 01:37:49
use multisig w/ someone you trust. so they can withdraw in the event of your death. Better yet, just set this up w/ a lawyer to notify your next of kin.
@_date: 2014-03-11 04:14:51
I have no idea. I'd almost say use a fake id. But that would be illegal.
I was able to withdraw Bitcoin w/o verification (i think).

The lady at the matress store who looked like she was about to call the authorities was in her 60s.
I talked with my wife's uncle in his 80s and he was actually really interested in it.
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:42:58
haha so true. fucking email was useful. wtf is this shit? some shitty python programmers came up with "Money 2.0" give me a fucking break.
@_date: 2014-08-02 16:25:17
Yeah. gives me time to develop my idea.
@_date: 2014-07-26 03:39:16
Cool domain name. Good design too and it works on mobile. You are off to a good start.

yeah that is one nice thing. no bailouts.
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:43:13
haha. i don't like it as much as iOS 6, but its still pretty good...considering the alternative. I have a Kindle Fire running some bastardized version of Android and its hell to use.
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:58:02
oh well. you fuck w/ the bull you get the horns.
incompetency should not be rewarded in the case of Mark Karpeles...and neither should illegal money laundering in the case of Charlie Shrem.
I hope Charlie sees his day in court. but if you do shady stuff you should not be compliance officer at an exchange.
@_date: 2014-07-06 19:39:13
It means trouble.
@_date: 2014-06-21 02:53:49
rookies over at Coinbase. I wonder what other rookie moves they are making with their codebase over there.
Don't trust 'em with more than $100.
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:27:59
i meant all altcoins. but btc may not recover either.
@_date: 2014-12-22 05:36:45
haha. ok. good luck w/ that attitude.
@_date: 2014-11-27 07:36:40
no i meant why should he give a shit?
I know I give a shit when someone calls for using open source to be grounds for jail.
@_date: 2014-08-04 03:51:54
Everyone has their price and PayPal is loaded to the teeth.
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:28:49

just pick up an amazon gift card on gyft.com you even get 3% off.

Seriously? Is that a plugin or something?
@_date: 2014-02-16 01:59:29
government. terrorism. obamacare.
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:23:33
what happened?
@_date: 2014-10-06 07:52:47
So did 9/11
@_date: 2014-05-06 00:34:55
This does not need to be a native app. Bitcoin was supposed to proliferate html5 apps. Because of iPhone ban. instead people are just assuming everyone will destroy their iPhone and move to android.
@_date: 2014-01-31 07:15:06
what is OpenCL?
@_date: 2014-03-14 03:23:07
i'd go with the new laser one.
125Th/s for 10k
@_date: 2014-06-28 04:37:51
yeah. cause he's a redditor.
@_date: 2014-03-30 19:54:47
"3 exchanges closed this week. Price drops". You can just publish that every week for the next year.
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:22:24
Is the code open source? if it isn't I would not trust it.
@_date: 2014-03-12 03:26:51
give up brain wallet or goto jail.
@_date: 2014-04-01 16:30:41
*goes dark*
@_date: 2014-02-05 17:21:28
they used to have a really good interest rate, but not anymore.
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:19:59
its dead.
@_date: 2014-08-04 04:36:44
Xapo is a US company that isn't serving US customers?
@_date: 2014-12-16 02:34:38
So Microsoft will be our new overlords.
@_date: 2014-08-03 20:32:15
if not there should be a setting for it. File a ticket with hive and multibit.
@_date: 2014-11-25 05:47:51
You're a naked movie star!
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:59:41
its not even unlimited, capped at 4GB otherwise I paid $1 per byte or something.
@_date: 2014-11-17 06:57:16
sure it is. if companies like Google enter the Bitcoin space you can bet your ass their devs will be all over the markets before they announce.
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:51:26
yeah. right. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 20:30:07
firebase will end up costing you an arm and a leg.
@_date: 2014-08-03 20:34:27
Which Coinbase is already doing. That's why its a match made in heaven.
@_date: 2014-01-28 21:14:20
how many times did they say 'terrorist' -- i heard once.
@_date: 2014-04-06 03:21:39
between 5-10k
@_date: 2014-08-03 22:28:46
@_date: 2014-12-16 02:36:39
switch to what?
@_date: 2014-11-17 01:27:14
its a valid concern. but one that is just going to happen eventually. much like the Internet, back in the day that's all they said about the Internet. Criminals.
@_date: 2014-04-02 05:27:53
So if it costs you $1000/month to mine and you earn $5000/month than it is profitable and people will continue to do it.
@_date: 2014-02-01 04:33:14
My planned reaction will be: "How the FUCKIN' CHRIST SAKE DO I SEcURE THIS SHIT WITHOUT LOOSING IT IN THE PROCESS?"
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:26:38
I can see the political ads now. "Uses Bitcoin for illegal activities!"
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:24:27
i'm just curious. i am going to be using them. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:13:02
Yeah. I think China is big wall.
@_date: 2014-10-23 04:43:58
heh, its called 'think or swim'.
try bitcoinwisdom.com
@_date: 2014-07-02 01:09:03
you are in bucket "B" my friend.
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:30:37
i would like to contact you off reddit.
@_date: 2014-03-26 00:48:39
Its actually illegal to fund terrorism, which is what tax dollars are used for.
@_date: 2014-03-10 05:12:24
@_date: 2014-03-30 19:49:18
Such attempt. Many Ponzi.
@_date: 2014-01-28 07:15:36
nobody controls it. anyone can participate.
in the US it isn't that big a deal whether you use them or not. but in other countries, 7 billion people don't have access to a bank. in the meantime, if it does gain wide spread adoption, they will be worth a lot more than $1k.
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:50:30
7 children? and you invested all your savings in BTC?
are you retarded?
@_date: 2014-11-24 19:07:16
Downvote him all you want, he's right. They have a whole brigade. And frankly, i'm not seeing much in the way of progress. Seems just like professionally hyped vaporware w/ a scam coin on the front end.
@_date: 2014-01-27 06:30:02
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:39:43
heh. you make no sense.
@_date: 2014-02-05 08:24:58
 is an up and comer.
@_date: 2014-11-27 08:55:19
yeah, all the video codecs out there make it impossible to provide one player. Have you tried the VLC app for iPhone? VLC (videolan.org) will play anything you throw at it and its open source.
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:54:03
hate to break it to ya, but in a free market, this shit will always happen.
@_date: 2014-12-29 04:25:52
dude looks to download open source "illegally" on pirate bay. love it.
@_date: 2014-11-24 19:06:02
I wondered the same thing.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:23:45
put 10% into Bitcoin. I'm doing the same, hopefully in 15 years it pays for college.
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:33:29
what am i supposed to do with gold? (besides look at it)
@_date: 2014-03-20 05:51:56
oh its one of those 'bunch of meaningless words i have to write down' wallets. No thanks.
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:54:15
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:06:11
you mean dad won her science fair project?
@_date: 2014-03-08 05:55:11
Newsweak should accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:49:23
its only a matter of time. snails pace right now. i don't think we'll see a big price jump until 2015.
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:13:36
dammit. andreas is going to pop a blood vessel when he gets back from vacation and hears this.
@_date: 2014-10-06 09:33:58
....and you didn't notice any problem? Like CPU overheating, or having to wait like 4 hours on a fiber connection to download the blockchain?
On my computer, it never finished, I gave up after a week. I use multibit, but lets just say its less than confidence inspiring.
@_date: 2014-11-05 05:54:22
can i buy cloud services on the o.co?
@_date: 2014-09-11 05:49:13
I think its about dominance in the payments industry. They should create an app for android if they want widespread adoption. I don't think they will sell more iPhones just because ApplePay is available on iPhone only.

Nice site btw. Just curious have you tried bitwall.io?
@_date: 2014-07-26 10:25:43
I don't know why all those would be Bitcoiners were polishing him up the past 6 months. I could tell that guy was a rat the first time I heard him speak.
@_date: 2014-11-25 06:44:18
exploitation? you kidding me its on every channel. I'm wondering because there's going to be a lot of damage done and we could help businesses by sending them bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-23 17:17:41
He will be asking government to bail him out.
@_date: 2014-11-25 02:17:38
I don't understand. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 06:44:31
looks good. hopefully news outlets will start to use this instead of those stupid gold coins.
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:57:42
because they deserve bonuses.
@_date: 2014-03-20 05:03:08
Coinbase is up next.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:25:33
Why not just hold on exchange. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 00:08:30
What happens if there's a run on the Bitcoin ATM? Do we all get rich?
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:51:55
I think there are a few exhanges that do this, although mcxnow is the only one i know of that is legit.
@_date: 2014-07-21 07:45:34
Oh man, you sound like me trying to do IM. I spent thousands of dollars on software. Then I went back to programming, because it was a waste of money trying to cheat the system.
Hold on to your 6.5BTC, its a respectable amount. If you use some, replace it. Build your savings over time like a 401k, $100/week or month. Whatever you can afford to throw away.
I think it will hit $1k by end of this year with all the mainstream adoption going on. Its going to be a hurdle to get past this BitLicense bullshit, but hopefully the people will prevail and not some government regulatory agency who doesn't understand shit about it.

Someone posted this video a few days ago and I finally got around to watching it:

I've been told time and time again not to use bitcoind api.
@_date: 2014-08-06 23:00:06
not sure i understand. I never used bit reserve.
@_date: 2014-07-11 04:42:40
What kind of miner? What's the hash rate?
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:56:28
easier to pay off politicians with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-31 02:56:55
no. the only thing giving bitcoin value is the fact that you can trade it for USD.
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:15:53
I agree with this one. I won't sit there for 10 minutes waiting for the next one unless there is something else going on the page.
Also you should use momentjs to do "Time.fromNow()" so it says "Last block found 7 minutes ago".. i don't know what the hell 1996 seconds means.
@_date: 2014-02-03 05:53:59
yeah. a friend of mine bought a bunch of dogecoin in the hopes it would reach $1000. I had to then explain how it works....and i'd be surprised if it reach a penny.
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:33:02
Deletecoin. sounds stupid.
@_date: 2014-04-06 04:00:42

ok, fine. I was going to call him hipster. but i didn't think that worked.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:27:27

@_date: 2014-06-11 00:14:47
I remember Prodigy.
@_date: 2014-05-28 17:26:56
what is the small one?
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:08:20
absolutely, with only 13m in circulation you can bet people will use fractional reserve banking eventually.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:02:01
I think that's true. I still don't understand why that causes transaction fees to go up. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:50:26

Does a fork in the code automatically mean a fork in the blockchain?
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:42:12
nice reporting latimes. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:37:20
you have to work with the merchant. refunds are not automatic, nor handled by Bitcoin at all. Its like cash.
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:10:31
long term (over 1 year) is about 23% i think. but you should go look it up somewhere, i just got those numbers from an accountant who specialized in Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-03-26 00:46:47
actually yes. I did. seeing as how its impossible for them to control. They are effectlvely taxing your consumption of the sun.

same here. i could buy a house....in afghanistan

@_date: 2014-08-02 06:56:06

yeah. those guys who faked their deaths just wanted to keep their wives from spending it all.
@_date: 2014-10-22 03:39:22
like fiverr.com or odesk for bitcoin? I think there's a huge opportunity here.
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:50:10
who the fuck is this tool?
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:46:34
oh right. *thats* what they mean.
@_date: 2014-11-16 09:15:55
what the hell are you talking about? seriously.
@_date: 2014-11-26 09:43:09
Yeah, sort of like that. Only funny.

@_date: 2014-03-11 06:23:30
adfreetime.com $2/month. and the best part is the traffic doesn't get routed through their servers...only the request that checks for blackout restriction. So you won't get choppy streams.
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:30:37
First off. How the hell does coinbase know your selling on localbitcoins?
Also. I guess I will stop recommending coinbase. As it requires anal probage. 
How much coins were you pulling out of coinbase?
@_date: 2014-08-09 04:43:32
i don't udnerstand what i'm looking at or for.

that's a bit of a stretch.

I used to listen to that band in the 80s. Japanese heavy metal band.
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:26:25
personally i would just transfer the btc to a multibit wallet and sit on 'em for another year or two.
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:26:11
yeah. its like those old gift cards where you couldn't spend the remainder balance. I bet they make a shit load just off that.

Why would you dump btc after a crash. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 02:40:45

@_date: 2014-02-02 04:36:09
throughout the entire process, I really got a bad taste for regulators. These guys were ill informed, didn't seem to be genuinely interested. It felt like they were just going through the motions of a "public hearing" and will do most of the legal proceedings behind closed doors.
@_date: 2014-08-13 07:50:08
Except why bother selling your house for Bitcoin if you're only interested in dollars?
@_date: 2014-05-08 08:46:39
THE government.

Yeah, I don't know if its good for long recording sessions though.
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:08:09
Why not? What if he is doing it to prove a point. You can deny all you want, the burden of proof is on the people doing the accusing. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 20:52:25
there are lots of reasons not to provide personal information to web sites.
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:46:35
to prove it is secure.
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:05:26
the same thing. price goes down, everyone buys back in.
i'm not worried about it.
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:09:15
but its an innocent looking pug.
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:07:28

@_date: 2014-11-20 10:12:43
nice :) this always gets the donkeys in a tussle.
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:11:21
coinbase only.
@_date: 2014-10-06 07:41:40
Haha. Was reagan president? I didn't watch news back then, only SNL.
I guess the facts are all wrong. WTF is this shit then that I remember so vidily? 
@_date: 2014-02-09 00:53:01
which is?
@_date: 2014-04-07 06:47:16
...and why would he do this?
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:46:14
easy to use as cash. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 04:13:52
I run a tor node. should i just shut it down so it doesn't get seized?
@_date: 2014-11-17 06:18:53

What are worried about?
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:17:34
i'm depressed now that our lord and savior andreas is on vacation.
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:28:44
Yeah. basically that is what I meant.
@_date: 2014-11-20 10:22:46
Look at the block.io module on npm. 
You can accept Dogecoin, Litecoin and Bitcoin here...and if you want an extra bonus, use shapeshift.io to convert between the 3 and payout in whatever currency the user chooses.
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:41:33
some of us do. see EPA.
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:18:39
I have no idea what will happen with Bitcoin in two years.
But having worked in technology since 1993 I can tell you that once it catches on it will grow extremely fast. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 03:14:01
You can donate them to "Will It Blend"

What grade is this for?
@_date: 2014-07-21 06:48:44
He did kind of fuck us on this one. Whether intentional or not.
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:01:24
We could call them "Newsweaks".
@_date: 2014-03-25 02:13:30
I was thinking the exact same thing. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:07:48
@_date: 2014-08-17 07:04:37
We have that now. Just more proof you are uneducated on that matter.
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:45:44
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:44:13
the only problem i have with them is they don't have a lot of extensions to choose from.
@_date: 2014-04-01 23:00:55
21 mjillion coins ever produced @ 2140. Seems finite to me.
@_date: 2014-02-12 21:30:54
Yes. I called it the goxed fee. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 04:59:04
install linux.
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:30:32
But he used his real name through? I don't know anyone that uses Tor and their real name. It kind of defeats the purpose.
@_date: 2014-02-06 08:22:41
Google 'bitcoin risks'
@_date: 2014-12-21 03:21:52
It doesn't have 2.1 quadrillion bitcoins. Youi're thinking of dogecoin. There are only 21 million. i think maybe you need to go back to school and learn to how read code. 
There's also only about half that in circulation. It won't be 21 million until 2140.
@_date: 2014-11-27 07:44:20
finally, someone who knows what they are talking about.
@_date: 2014-01-23 03:54:33
I don't think anyone *wants* to see the dollar crash. But you would be a fool not to prepare for it.
@_date: 2014-01-15 06:34:19
Spike on mtgox. I guess the news of Outlook.com and other retailers are starting to have an impact on price.
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:02:48
well then they are idiots if they don't take into account software bugs.
@_date: 2014-04-07 06:05:44
no, that's web 3.0. web 2.0 was 2002 after the crash.
@_date: 2014-07-24 06:03:14
checkout bitcore.io they have an npm module, you can probably do it with that programmatically.
@_date: 2014-05-08 08:57:52
with terrorist news on the forefront?
@_date: 2014-01-27 06:29:24
Doing research for your next sermon?
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:31:45
proves nothing.
@_date: 2014-07-28 02:44:56
i agree, we need more ways to buy btc in US besides coinbase.
@_date: 2014-11-17 01:57:01
i don't remember where it was.
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:26:59
don't trust canadians. never have.
@_date: 2014-12-22 06:39:53
So you're trusting banks with your bitcoin. a bit ironic wouldn't you say?
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:26:36

Well except he was anti-bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-21 07:30:04
Andreas was right. We should have told those regulators to "fuck off" last year. Instead, we begged for their approval, and now this is what we get.
@_date: 2014-02-12 23:42:45
because apple is developing iMoney.
@_date: 2014-03-05 04:56:16

@_date: 2014-03-16 21:46:09
more like bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:47:36
that must be such a cush job.
@_date: 2014-03-27 03:35:59
i've put my buying on hold.
@_date: 2014-07-23 06:55:52
@_date: 2014-03-20 06:32:54
he's probably using tor to register a new account with each link drop.
we should just ban 'freeee' and that would knock out 50% of them. Then we need to ban 'lost &lt;xxxx&gt; btc'.
or just ban the urls.
@_date: 2014-05-10 03:26:34
well, she *was* posing for the camera wearing that silly outfit. I'd say the decision was hers, not yours.
@_date: 2014-03-06 04:58:22

@_date: 2014-02-06 06:50:12
Good time to buy. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 09:19:43
we should hack  and install one of these themes.
@_date: 2014-07-06 23:14:32
Probably better if they used this:
`dig +short myip.opendns.com

@_date: 2014-03-02 05:26:05

@_date: 2014-03-23 02:32:49

@_date: 2014-03-09 18:51:53


yeah. uh. no.

@_date: 2014-02-03 06:12:44
memorable though. did they make money from it? who knows.

There's no way he would try to cashout  at this point. It would be like selling APPL stock at $15 when you bought it at $1. If he waits 10 years he won't need to cash out. He could just spend it.
@_date: 2014-01-27 00:09:45
most people won't take that risk. because you could simply file a dispute and they would take a loss.

Explain that to me again? you paid .5btc to make a car and then its only worth .1btc? Why is this bad? It just means you cost to produce more cars is probably only .01btc.

early adopters often are rewarded. Its called "recognizing an opportunity". I bought APPL stock at 45 bucks when the iPod first came out. I knew it was a game changer.
I just sold way way way way way too early (@ 90 as soon as it doubled). I'm not calling for early APPL investors to give up their shares or anything its just the way the world works....buy BTC now, its still a decent price if you believe in the Bitcoin long term.
If you can't afford to outright buy them, then earn them. You could still hold a decent amount before it goes through the roof in a couple of years.

nice. I think I bought around 27 or so the first time. When it went to 275 I knew it was a pump, but I thought community would hold the price up. I guess that didn't happen. Some guys pumped the shit out of that coin and made off w/ the loot. Now its trending towards $0. Like all alts.

i'm still optimistic long term, but I hear you . .. who will drive up the price w/ no buyers? the Lawsky License is going to be the nail in the coffin for legal bitcoin use here in the states. I imagine price will tank in 45 days.

he did tell people. he posted several months in advance about what he was doing before he developed the software. Its called peer review. Stop your nonsense and go back to @_date: 2014-10-26 02:06:05
Anyone know what it's like to work there? Or for any other bitcoin company for that matter?  Bitpay seems like a cool place to work. But I imagine working with a bunch of bitcoins assholes wouldn't be too fun.

what is prelude.io ?
@_date: 2014-07-05 20:55:31
I think you are right.

Bush was a puppet though. Its pretty obvious Cheney was running the show. Not that I support him, just saying.
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:44:15
I couldn't understand any of what he said. It read like he used one of those corporate bullshit generators from the Internet.

we have a 4.5B market cap!!! Down from 12B last year this time....what could possibly go wrong? we are taking over the world!!!!

i see a lot of issues where people send money and it never shows up on the destination address. I never have had that problem with a bank or credit card.
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:39:19
i'm not suggesting you were saying they were going to shut down. I'M saying that. Roger Ver himself said this.
@_date: 2014-07-23 04:24:42
I think you are a money transmitter if you're over a certain amount. I don't know exactly what. But I've heard people get burned by doing too much transactions on localbitcoins.com

expensive coins next week.
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:21:45
got that was horrible. i got half way through and had to give up.
@_date: 2014-11-17 00:11:16
...which is just as good as the real thing.
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:22:21
@_date: 2014-03-30 19:46:54
So its crashing.
@_date: 2014-08-11 06:36:45
I never saw anything like that. Maybe I didn't create one. I saw it populated what appeared to be a wallet with about 5 or 6 address and some change address (whatever that is).
To confusing for me to trust it with real money.

Satoshi's brother in law.
@_date: 2014-03-12 05:18:10
You seem to have a pre-formed opinion...an uninformed one at that.
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:09:04
I misread that. I thought that was 30 day graph.
Maybe blockchain has corrupt data, they did have a db issue for awhile. Otherwise i have no idea. Multipools probably causing jumping around currencies. I propose we create Anti-Multipool pools. Instead of mining the most profitable coin, creating bandwagon effect,  they mine the least profitable currency at the time. This could be a niche for anyone claiming a loss on IRS. Get refunds.
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:15:56
also i suggest you support other currencies besides Bitcoin.
I have a shit load of doge that I don't know what to do with.
@_date: 2014-04-12 04:17:30
no shit. anyone who used a mining profitablilty calculator would have known this.

@_date: 2014-02-15 22:45:12
you know what they say, any press is good press. and gox sure has had plenty of it lately.
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:29:45
we can't?
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:40:58
i think they withhold the source code.
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:52:47
all i can say is that i will never verify again.
@_date: 2015-05-24 09:22:22
do over!
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:19:24
what exactly are you implying?
@_date: 2014-08-04 03:51:08
btc-e no questions asked.
cryptsy used to be that way, but now they fucked up by dealing with fiat.
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:37:34
Yeah, but they still have a stranglehold on the market. Gotta over throw the incombents first.
@_date: 2014-02-16 02:09:27
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:49:17
Yeah. shit is broke on mac. No joke. I did try in 2011 and the reason I gave up was because it never downloaded...just overheated my mac. Does the same thing today. I still have yet to install Bitcoin-QT successfully.

True sign of an amateur.

yeah. i setup a google alert last year and got about one alert per week. Now I get around 10/day.
@_date: 2014-04-04 04:19:18
Yeah. but i think there were no investors a year ago, so they had to get creative.
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:45:49
all this is proving is that mtgox is incompetant and the coins were stolen long ago.
@_date: 2014-03-05 02:41:54
p2p, if only it were easy.
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:56:20
i don't see anything about bitcoin on their site.
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:58:05
yeah. well if that happens it will be everywhere. causing it to be 50-100 million each.
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:45:27
I was so stupid to have upload my credentials to some site.
@_date: 2014-08-17 04:02:32
i get a 307 Temporary Redirect error.
@_date: 2014-07-18 15:47:22
They are trying to regulate it. Everyone knew this was going to happen, you have the "yes sirs" who are public figures on wallstreet trying to  "play ball" with something they seemingly don't even understand themselves yet.

Were they early BitInstant investors?
@_date: 2014-07-12 04:03:19
yeah. always will be imo. mining is racket. just like gold rush, people who sold shovels and pick axes made the money.
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:17:21

mine other altcoins.
oh you said anything *but* that. well you can scrap it for parts. Recycle it. Pawn it off onto some poor schmuck for $17k on eBay.
You could just return it and then follow up with a letter from an attorney about it doesn't function as advertised and how you want your money back.
I personally would throw it away and have it sit in a landfill. But I'm like that.
@_date: 2014-02-03 00:51:50
How about we create an andreascoin instead.
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:43:28
sorry about your jaw. don't use security protocols you don't understand.
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:15:35
Could be either. But from my experience 90% of things are crap. So this is no different.
@_date: 2014-03-28 04:23:09
Fuck off. nweb.
@_date: 2014-04-03 04:26:05
that is just going to benefit traders and speculators.

...its in the water. You can't run.
@_date: 2014-07-29 04:24:08
I would avoid them. They seem rather scammy, at least the companies they list are. Plus their website doesn't inspire much confidence in their ability to code.
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:47:21
if coinbase gets hacked, what good is a paper wallet to you?
@_date: 2014-12-28 08:23:50
Yup. even my whore mother.

hehe :)
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:02:50
Yeah, whose the "they" in this case? What experts did they consult because your average IRS regulator/attorney isn't going to know shit about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:35:49
who's this lady promoting centralized digital currencies?
@_date: 2014-11-20 10:17:54
that doesn't sound like a lot.
@_date: 2014-04-03 16:16:15
there is some novelty in sending money anywhere in the world at the click of a button. but really, how many times do I have to do that? maybe buy coffee online from farmer directly. But then i'll have to calculate capital gains on each transaction, figure out what i paid for btc and price of exchange rate when i bought something w/ btc. then report that to IRS. fuck it. At this point it is way easier to just use Amazon Pay.
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:18:29
it'll probably go to 750 in the next week or two.
beyond that who knows. i expect it go back to 1200 in a month or two. My prediction of 10k for 2014 still stands.
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:05:50
Coinbase is probably one of the safer ones afa online goes. But the government will know immediately. If you want to stay off the radar use LocalBitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:39:04
So you send me a satoshi that is "tied" to ownership of your car.....then what? What if you report car as stolen?

Part of me thinks it'll go to 10k or even 100k this year.
The other part of me thinks it will probably only be popular among Libertarian/Anarchists who hate the state.
I personally don't have any reason to use it. wallets are a pita to use and my money is safer in a bank. I hold a few because I was lucky enough to throw some money down a year ago and catch the rise. I don't put much $ in at this price though.

i agree with you. it definitely has its weaknesses. I don't think it will go past 1000 anytime soon. People don't want some experimental technology at 1000/each.
MINT is full PoS now. They have a shit load of coins though. So that kind of ruins it for me.
There's also Gridcoin, which everyone says is "hackable" yet the bounty is still unclaimed.

You're right...for someone who goes to grocery store and buys stuff at Costco/Amazon....there is no reason to use Bitcoin.
But if you're doing international trade, there are certainly some benefits. I personally would rather accept payment online in Bitcoin/Litecoin/Dogecoin rather than credit card/paypal. Cuts out the middle man. I don't mind risking the long term hold downside as I believe the upside is enormous.

@_date: 2014-04-02 04:31:06
every transaction has a transaction fee, unless you don't include one, which isn't recommended because it can take hours/days to confirm w/o fee.
the fee is neglible to the people involved in the transaction, but adds up for miners confirming the block when done in large volumes.
if there's money to be made, then rest assured people will be trying to mine.

I have no idea how this will turn out in 2-5 years. But I can tell you this, going through the dotcom bubble I missed out on the opportunity of a lifetime.
If you can spare even enough to buy .25 BTC (about $150)...it may be worth a shitload of money in 5 years. It also could be worth nothing and you'd be out the $150.
Short of that, if you do business online, you can move value/money to anyone in the world in about 15 seconds for about 5 cents transaction fee.

exchanges are notoriously slow. They have high load and sometimes require 3 confirmations. You don't need that for day-to-day transactions. You can assume that when it shows up in recipient's wallet it is safe, which should only be a few seconds. If you're buying a house or something, then wait for 6 confirmations. But for a sandwich, you don't need to wait.

i wondered the same thing. even a web page request is a bi-directional communication.
@_date: 2014-07-09 17:15:31
Browser extensions? No thanks.
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:50:02
yeah. hopefully the regulation yields a safe harbor for startups so we can move forward and not be locked out of the market.
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:46:21
Ironic. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 03:32:54
this tax guidance won't stick.
@_date: 2014-03-26 00:46:07
that's old thinking.
@_date: 2014-09-11 05:44:03
I got a kindle fire when it first came out. I won't buy amazon device again after that. Sure, it had some of the popular android apps, but they didn't quite work as well because it wasn't really android.
@_date: 2014-02-09 20:10:27
Its easy to use and extremely fungible once you actually acquire Bitcoin. There are dozens of exchanges where you can day trade crypto currencies as well. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 02:43:22
Damn. that is some serious accusations if true. It doesn't surprise me though. I used to do this for a company that did this exact thing but for search engine to improve their ranking for their own web sites. They were a bit on the shady side. Had a bouncer working for them doing 'biz dev'. He even told me once "I have no idea why I'm here. I don't do anything, I just surf the web all day. I think I'm only here because I'm big."
@_date: 2014-12-24 09:19:00
great video. absolutely agree with him. its our only hope as civilization.
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:18:41
you betta go withdraw that!!!
@_date: 2014-02-02 22:01:08
yeah, but most people don't understand the impact of that.
@_date: 2014-02-18 03:39:04
yeah. its so funny. i report every one of his shitty little posts. I wish we could just ban his ip.
@_date: 2014-10-06 09:43:55
He was a madman.  You think its bad now with the media. We literally had 3 tv stations. That was it.
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:12:52
you can trade altcoins because altcoins, if you catch a rise, tend to go up a lot more than Bitcoin.

i personally don't like how the blockchain is already too big to download. So anything that offers a decentralized solution to that problem will be worth looking into.

next session starts in 30 minutes (2:30pm EST).
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:34:07
......and they made the announcement after most people have already filed.
@_date: 2014-02-18 03:19:21
Ahhh, that makes more sense. I thought it was 38 visits total across the entire campaign.
@_date: 2014-02-11 02:43:36
Does this mean Litecoin is on hold?
@_date: 2014-08-09 17:51:24
Yeah that logo sucks. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 07:31:14
....repeat, we got a wall down, exchange 
@_date: 2014-10-07 00:35:14
haha. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 06:56:58
come to the reality that javascript kicks ass.
@_date: 2014-11-20 09:56:33
What do you want the trade bot (node) to do?
@_date: 2014-10-18 06:21:08
just sit on it. 1k bitcoin is what, 379k? Its a lot of money, don't get me wrong, but that's just a good down payment on a house around here.
@_date: 2014-07-11 05:12:34
Maybe this will help: 
@_date: 2014-11-29 00:52:35
I found this out real quick 2 years ago. I was talking about Bitcoin a lot, everyone thought I was running a ponzi scheme or selling drugs online.
Once the price started skyrocketing they got more interested....but as soon as mtgox fell, everyone thought it was a ponzi and they were right.
@_date: 2014-12-21 01:30:28
if you want it to be the world's reserve currency, you'll need more than 21 Million of them.
@_date: 2014-11-05 06:04:17
shit dog. you is young.
mine was like 240k.
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:12:14
i always thought they were a little "tardy" looking. so i didn't use them.
@_date: 2014-08-15 05:49:13
They probably voted for Obama and are offended he didn't.
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:41:53
i think you're probably right. back in 1990s it wasn't the JPMorgan's that created datek and etrades.
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:19:23
and if bitaddress.org is gone, then what?
@_date: 2014-01-19 19:57:39
they will find away. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 01:54:23
ask Apple.
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:28:15
no. wait. i mean...i shit breakfast when i eat! wait no....
@_date: 2014-02-01 23:07:23
yeah. oh well. shit happens. if i spent $1000 on it, I'd be sitting pretty right now...but I could say that about Google, Apple, domain names back in the mid 90s. Its really a talent to recognize these trends *before* they happen.
@_date: 2014-03-31 02:57:49
not on a mac. it never finishes. i let it run for 2 weeks once.
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:43:35
and then gox will update their web site.
@_date: 2014-11-29 02:39:27
its not a joke. if people are going to riot and protest over ferguson....imagine what they will do when the dollar collapses.
@_date: 2014-02-06 07:22:10
half a billion dollars worth of bitcoin from mtgox?
what are the two transactions?
@_date: 2014-08-06 23:04:05
You know I thought it might be October as well. I was just thinking the other day, everyone is enjoying summer. October will be when everyone gets back to business.
@_date: 2014-11-18 05:53:24
haha. yeah. there goes the neighborhood.
@_date: 2014-08-13 07:39:21
Maybe he stabbed himself with a needle while dumpster diving and had to take some time off. Give the guy a break.
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:01:14
i don't know man, what do you want me to say? I'd get killed over 10 bucks?
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:24:55
700k in 2014? I don't think there's an exchange yet that could handle that level of volume.
@_date: 2014-04-12 21:50:11
What if government is anonymous and decentralized?
@_date: 2014-07-23 06:17:05
@_date: 2014-03-26 00:51:23
Do they realize that if I bought a 1BTC at $1000 and then bought $1 banana with part of it at today's price, that'd I'd be claiming a loss on my income?

Bank: ...Lawsky needs his fix.
@_date: 2014-10-01 12:08:07
.....and 30 seconds later you realized how wrong you were!
@_date: 2014-02-17 04:23:38
17M in fees doesn't actually sound like that much...considering how much volume they've had in the past 3 years.
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:36:39
supposedly in a few hours.
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:19:24
from 2013-2014 there were thousands of altcoins created. Bitcoin is still 
I don't really understand your point. Not one of these altcoins will unseat Bitcoin except maybe fucking Dogecoin. The other "innovative" coins all rely on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-15 05:37:18
I think he meant figuratively and  you're taking it literally.
@_date: 2014-09-21 02:36:01
@_date: 2014-08-02 06:09:26
Heh. yeah. I first heard about bitcoin when SR went live. I thought the ONLY use was for drugs online. I wish I had read a bit more about why it was created and who Satoshi was.
@_date: 2014-11-05 06:21:15
@_date: 2014-08-17 03:57:07
@_date: 2014-08-17 07:22:53
Really? You don't think people working with the code have more knowledge than some person off the street who read about Bitcoin being a ponzi scheme?
@_date: 2014-05-06 17:29:50
what would be cool if Dogecoin vs. Bitcoin were to fight each other in the octagon. I would watch that.
@_date: 2014-03-02 20:12:56
....until they get goxxed again.
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:48:10
someone will do fractional reserve banking with bitcoin. just a matter of time.
@_date: 2014-03-20 05:22:38
I would *never* do that.
@_date: 2014-11-27 09:22:13


where do   you enter this?
@_date: 2014-10-18 03:59:13
did you remove it and re-install?
@_date: 2014-03-25 04:26:32
I don't understand. Does it still work if their site closes?
@_date: 2014-03-20 06:24:58
its the same guy. he has infiltrated for weeks now.
i wish he would maybe get a new dictionary.
@_date: 2014-04-12 04:16:20
Depends. Is that your last dollar? Will you jump off a bridge if it goes to $100?
@_date: 2014-02-16 01:48:36
you heard about the protests at mtgox headquarters?
@_date: 2015-05-24 18:15:14
...and that's a good thing?
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:58:44
i'll send you 1mbit for it.
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:20:20
idiot? that's it i'm putting on my fucking gox box sox and kickin' yo ass.
@_date: 2014-03-23 17:43:58
That's not going to happen. Anybody can throw up a web site and be an exchange. Nothing is preventing incompetent people from entering an unregulated market.
@_date: 2014-05-10 23:45:01
i don't follow. what is the conspiracy?

@_date: 2014-08-05 04:29:17
would these fucking idiot media outlets stop showing a fucking gold coin to represent Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-16 05:07:30
this is why i don't bother with complicated security bullshit.
i use multibit and backup keys offsite.
@_date: 2014-03-04 06:30:18

@_date: 2014-08-03 02:59:57

I live in south bay area and have yet to see a Bitcoin Accepted sign in real life. So don't expect much.
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:03:44
i don't think bitcoin will necessarily die. As far as merchants are concerned its a method of transferring value. As long as a crypto currencies provides that, they will be willing to accept it.

brilliant idea. great application for bitcoin.
whenever i see people doing this I see the legitimacy and it excites me again. I know too many people who go to Mexico once or twice a year just to buy meds, because American pharmaceutical companies rip americans off.
@_date: 2014-02-28 04:50:35
Because people who know how to use Bitcoin also know how to get porn for free.
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:46:32
Yeah. I think its pretty obvious Bitcoin will be replaced. It needs a full rewrite.
@_date: 2014-11-16 22:03:34

There's only one problem. In order for Bitcoin to be worth $10,000 dollars each, that means there was a financial collapse and gas is probably $100/gallon as is bread, etc.

I was listening to the latest Lets Talk Bitcoin podcast, which answers this quite well.
From what my peabrain could pick up, Mastercoin will utilize the Bitcoin blockchain and add features on top of it.
Ethereum stands on its own (I think) and is billed as a platform for building more apps ontop of its core technology.
Both sounds good. Which will win out? probably both in some form or another at least in the short term. I think bitcoin has a lot of problems, usual with a 1.0 version of a technology.
The interesting thing I thought was that they were really trying to blow this shit wide open with regards to government regulation.
@_date: 2014-03-11 03:49:30

@_date: 2014-03-14 03:42:28
it hurts my eyes.
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:34:18
same reason there's always a discrepancy in prices when two people sell the same thing.
@_date: 2014-01-19 07:24:08
This could be big though. The first Bitcoin TV commercial. I wonder what the first commercial was that had an email address on it. Probably nobody knows.
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:24:42
nice graph. but it won't go much higher.
@_date: 2014-10-06 08:00:02
If you have to ask...
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:44:10
you should add a scuba diver shibe w/ anchor around its foot.
@_date: 2014-07-16 09:18:42
he got me.
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:57:43
so just send your payment in transactions of &lt; 50 cents?
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:29:02
So Newegg's marketing department is retarded.
@_date: 2014-03-05 07:16:06
what does that mean?
@_date: 2014-01-31 08:23:15
what client are you using where you type 'dumpprivkey'?
@_date: 2014-11-25 00:12:51
Like this one? So you can all hop on here, downvote me and offer a rebuttal to the ponzi?
@_date: 2014-11-24 18:41:49
its like 1974 in internet time. Bitcoin is compuserve and dogecoin is prodigy.
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:02:46
seriously. he may be fat but i dig his passion.
@_date: 2014-02-17 05:01:47
First ever officially licensed cryptocurrency. This sounds interesting.
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:32:51
I hear ya. I think that isn't the goal of Bitcoin development though. They are providing a set of tools and companies are supposed to implement solutions with them.
@_date: 2014-07-25 07:56:08
....and there's nothing else to that story.
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:59:46
Ok, I read somewhere that each transaction was like 1k or something.
@_date: 2014-11-04 06:31:10
me neither. he is logged in probably.
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:11:39
haha. me too!
@_date: 2014-07-17 04:35:08
crazy. probably will be worth a lot if someone develops it.i probably wouldn't have sold it for only 75k though.
@_date: 2014-10-06 09:24:49
wtf, they charged me like $21 to buy at $300.
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:04:05
seems like yet another gamble
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:12:28
ok, so you have to figure out how to mine first. Not your average person. I'm talking about johnny and sue who just got their bitcoin off coinbase. They aren't going to be pulling any double-spend attacks. I think its fine to not wait for confirmations on &lt; $100.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:10:52
you just search the WSJ title in Google and follow link from Google to full article. They are only paywalling links that aren't coming from Google.
@_date: 2014-03-26 13:54:26
who should i blame then? if not hippies.
@_date: 2014-04-03 19:15:30
I've been retired since 24. Now I just work for a living.
@_date: 2015-05-31 05:08:33
Someone said you can get a free trial, but I don't see an option for that.
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:15:47
Yay free market! another win!
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:45:05
right. theres no police. they all shoot each other.
@_date: 2014-09-15 00:19:38
i know the one you mean.
@_date: 2014-02-01 22:20:44
I don't care. niners lost.
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:29:08
i'm addicted to windows.
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:32:54
@_date: 2014-02-17 23:24:33


Totalling what, exactly?
38 visits from the tweet wall? That doesn't sound very encouraging for the 9th largest newspaper in the country doing a trial run on a paywall.
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:10:46
now you can go to cryptsy.com and trade them for bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:34:46
I have the same concern with coinbase.
@_date: 2014-03-14 03:53:27
all part of the experiment. let fail on its own.
whoever said miners would stop mining didn't think about the gold rush. people will still mine even if unprofitable in the hopes that one day it *is* profitable.
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:54:26
why? when was his blog hacked?
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:06:24
dude, you basically fucked yourself by being dishonest and now you're telling me how great mtgox is.
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:35:19
Its a bad decision. A very bad one.
@_date: 2014-07-01 06:19:51
@_date: 2014-08-17 06:54:12
I still don't understand what you have against early adopters.
@_date: 2014-02-04 07:37:11
What are you building?
@_date: 2014-10-07 00:36:43
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:58:27
because they require anal probes when paying with Bitcoin now.
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:04:16
so you're throwing the baby out w/ the bathwater.
@_date: 2014-10-06 05:51:33
"Well, its a cup....with dirt in it. I call it cup-o-dirt. You should move on down the line now."
@_date: 2014-04-05 23:52:44
how about a simple fucking password on multibit. its rediculous.
@_date: 2014-08-06 03:43:07
haha. its porn for bitcoiners.
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:32:07
Yeah. its like hearing libertarians talk about Ron Paul getting elected. Nobody gives a shit. I pretty much lost faith when the delusional talk about "the other 6B".
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:17:26
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:04:34
yes. you are probably too young to have experienced the growth of the Internet.
@_date: 2015-05-25 20:27:09
Man, they get hacked at least once every 6 months. Maybe they should stop using SMF.
@_date: 2014-11-17 07:18:29
OP is more intelligent.
@_date: 2014-05-12 07:26:28
can i run a full node easily? i have yet to do it. I have 3 dedicated servers sitting around serving 10 hits/month.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:13:51
dammit. this fool up'ed his game.
@_date: 2014-03-12 05:01:00
Yeah. I agree...but these are the guys we want on the Bitcoin Foundation if they are going to get my support. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 17:01:15
ignore reason. you'll be posting here in 2 months asking how to unencrypt lost password.
@_date: 2014-07-05 22:10:25
pump? yeah. I'm "pumping" them right now. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 05:40:15
there's a service where you swap amazon items for bitcoin. I forget the name of it though.
@_date: 2014-04-03 17:33:31
can't they just patch the code. problem solved?
@_date: 2014-03-20 23:06:38
Gox was the bitcoin ponzi scheme everyone was talking about.
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:50:41
Pretty much agree here. Its not going to do anything except put up barriers to entry.
@_date: 2014-07-02 03:45:13
i wonder if bitcoin will ever get over its darknet roots.
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:30:01
they can't control it so they tax the shit out of it.
@_date: 2015-05-17 10:14:04
yeah. we're not dealing with accounting professionals for the most part. "What's a ledger?". "Its like when you balance your checkbook".
"What's a checkbook?"
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:50:49
you are probalby right.
@_date: 2014-06-02 07:08:11
never use paypal for irreversible transactions.
@_date: 2014-12-20 06:28:48
perfect. i'd tip you but they banned me for some reason.
@_date: 2014-02-03 00:48:08
free market baby. it will all sorts itself out.
@_date: 2014-11-04 02:57:31
bad boogie man.
@_date: 2014-10-01 11:55:00
You ever see the image with vulture next to starving african child?
That one is more powerful than some iPhone users.
@_date: 2014-04-02 00:09:49
except in this case. seems hacky.
@_date: 2014-07-21 07:38:05
Your lawyer will likely email it to their clerk. Compromising it in the process.
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:40:47
those were casacious coins and i don't think you can get them anymore since govt shut 'em down.
@_date: 2015-05-25 06:58:34
I wish my video editing skills were better. Can someone put the bitcoin logo inplace of the muppets?
@_date: 2014-04-11 04:30:49
....we also have the crime part covered. Libertarians will shoot everyone who breaks the law.
@_date: 2014-02-09 00:12:34
yup. also do small amounts. I only buy $100 or so. I'm not one of these whackos who throws in thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2014-07-24 05:29:05
i'm sad to hear people say this.
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:15:12
That's why i like appstore. This shit doesnt' get approved.
@_date: 2014-03-27 01:12:30
oh well. i tried.
@_date: 2015-05-22 19:24:44
so it's back on?
@_date: 2015-05-31 05:12:22
Yeah. If it was good quality, I'd pay.
@_date: 2014-07-02 01:20:18
I remember those.
@_date: 2014-08-04 02:52:05
My bad. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 07:42:59
I want it to crash the browser. They better rewrite that piece of the UI to use react or ember/glitter.
@_date: 2015-05-21 07:07:33
I heard something about battery life. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 22:16:29
i'm buying at 279
@_date: 2014-10-29 07:33:58
I may have to switch to Linux to get away from all this MacOS cloud bullshit.
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:37:58
i would not autobuy.
but i do the same. i treat it like a 401k. I buy every week or two...just a little bit. Over the long haul it will add up.
I also don't recommend you put more than 10% (and that is being generous) into a technology that is not proven.
@_date: 2014-11-29 01:58:40
- "How much Bitcoin do you own?"
- "What is your private key?"
@_date: 2014-11-22 06:54:41
waiting to buy in at 279
@_date: 2014-10-18 06:48:14
That's not bad. But its still out of reach for me. I would need to bring home about double what I do now. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:44:49
so is cash.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:02:31
What if you bought BTC on Coinbase and then tumbled the fuck out of it before you sent it to your personal wallet?....or...I mean..uh...*tipped* some stranger out of the kindness of your heart. How does IRS account for that scenario?
@_date: 2014-11-17 01:40:19
@_date: 2014-03-09 06:19:11
@_date: 2014-08-19 05:54:46
One big reason for businesses to accept Bitcoin is because it immediately opens them up to a global market. With traditional payment system you typically can only operate in certain countries...not to mention is cheaper for them.
@_date: 2014-02-10 00:05:14
 you must be retarded.
there are html5 wallets that just use the browser and have access to camera for QR code.
i don't know what your mom has to do with a credit card payment.
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:35:09
sounds like it.
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:30:26
where we are headed in the next week: @_date: 2014-02-23 06:02:53
Obama wants to take your 401k. its true. Been on MarketWatch all weekend.
@_date: 2014-03-14 05:35:03
not btc-e. no anal probe 
@_date: 2014-03-08 08:19:21
you must be scraping.
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:11:50
whichever analogy applies to you.
@_date: 2014-03-27 03:00:48
i meant the number of transactions only. Not dollar value.
@_date: 2014-10-06 06:54:16
Ironically, the mere fact that O'Reilly has a book about Bitcoin gives it some legitimacy.
@_date: 2014-10-06 19:40:56
Electrium looks good. but i don't understand all the change addresses.
@_date: 2014-08-09 18:36:21
I recommend you just tell them to use paybits.net
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:36:15


@_date: 2014-02-02 05:33:00
100/day? That's insane.
@_date: 2014-08-12 04:26:49
@_date: 2014-01-31 05:46:18
it was their anti-spam measure, .01BTC to edit it. This was back when Bitcoin was $10. Nobody ever changed it.
@_date: 2015-05-30 23:20:08
Thanks. Can I restore a Greenaddress in something like Electrum? and vice-versa?
@_date: 2015-05-24 09:02:51
Yeah. I would definitely give it a shot. I would charge 50 cents an hour though....you're not going to get any takers at 10/hour. But it's nice you can set your own price. What is their business strategy? They don't take a cut, so do they plan on building premium features?
It's also very cool it is open source. I was waiting for someone to build something like this so I could poach the payment mechanism from them. As I'm completely lost when it comes to integrating Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:05:00
you have to use 2fa to withdraw?? that is news for me. not everyone has 2FA devices.
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:18:17
that's why he made it open source I assume.
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:16:32
I don't think he knows what XSS is.
@_date: 2014-08-09 06:35:36
Put it up on github, I'll look at it.
@_date: 2015-05-31 05:19:20
I don't have comcast.
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:42:50
yeah. they will be our future leaders. so buy BTC now to ensure your family survives the apocolypse and market meltdown of 2015.
@_date: 2014-11-17 00:18:46
@_date: 2014-07-05 21:35:32
That is the new one. I have an old wallet with bitcointipbot
@_date: 2015-05-31 05:10:41
This is ridiculous...and why I no problem using alternative means.
@_date: 2014-11-17 01:33:15
dude, because your an idiot if you hold 100% in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-14 04:15:26


lol. i plan on doing the same with my kids. at what age did you introduce Bitcoin to her?
setup a doge wallet for her.
@_date: 2014-04-09 20:29:18
Why not?
@_date: 2014-11-16 03:59:53
yup. super lag.
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:36:52
not gox.
@_date: 2014-07-05 22:04:39
I would go. If I had invested in 2011.
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:16:13
@_date: 2015-05-28 08:59:50
So....did you know nobody cares? It's called reality.
@_date: 2014-11-17 07:11:09
1 shot of antibiotics
@_date: 2014-08-17 04:06:46
What happened?
@_date: 2014-07-19 18:05:20
Because you can brute force that?
@_date: 2014-05-10 23:40:05
i want to go to space. too bad it would take 200 years for me to save up that money.
@_date: 2014-12-21 03:12:15
Yes, that's what I'm telling you. You seem to not understand how the Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2014-07-08 17:02:06
We should start a charity "No Shoes for Terrorists". It would be  lot harder to conduct Jihad against the Infidels w/o shoes.
@_date: 2015-05-31 07:54:13
People don't know what a ledger is.
@_date: 2015-05-20 07:17:24
Not really. More news....still no price movement. That exchange fund or whatever that shit was has had like 5 trades since it opened.
@_date: 2014-02-02 04:33:15
the gift that keeps on growing.
seriously. it will be 30TB if all these blockchain projects take off.
@_date: 2014-02-02 06:36:19
yes, bittorrent for downloading movies is still largely among the technically savvy for those who are ok skirting the copyright law in the US.
You don't see too many Bittorrent companies now do you?
@_date: 2014-07-08 16:59:15
I'm just waiting for Andreas to start saying "....well, it wouldn't be a very good currency if you couldn't launder terrorist money with it." on his daily lecture circuit.
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:21:15
i think. 10k in 2014.
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:44:34
You shouldn't be convincing people that hard to get into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-22 22:11:30
F-The-Fed is a good one.
@_date: 2014-04-03 04:10:13
Bitcoin needs a killer app. Something that will cause people to want to use Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:58:29
they will know you own them if you used coinbase or gox or most likely any other exchange besides btc-e and they are going to fall next I bet.
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:29:53
good for you. you think i give a fuck? 
@_date: 2015-05-06 08:44:45
I haven't upgraded my wallet in over a year.
@_date: 2015-05-24 07:37:46
10 USD/hour
you kidding? I'll pay you 25 cents/hour tops.
@_date: 2015-05-28 08:58:54
don't know what a `turd smear` is, but Elementary is one of the better shows on TV.
@_date: 2015-05-24 09:33:09
You can be a bridge builder, take a company public, and land on the moon and people will respect you.....but you fuck one goat....
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:04:46
coinbase api @ 4pm
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:24:28
Just wait.
@_date: 2014-10-06 07:51:10
Nice. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 04:02:24
there are lots of altcoin exchanges. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 03:21:57
I don't get it.
@_date: 2014-07-08 04:47:30


@_date: 2014-09-11 05:47:17
He may take Bitcoin if you ask (he's a pretty cool guy).  very fast and reliable. best proxies I used when I did have a need for them.
@_date: 2014-12-22 08:04:17
its seems like its still in the hobbyist stage. maybe another 10 years and something good will come of it.
@_date: 2014-08-11 07:28:08
are these 12 word mneumonics interchangable between wallet software? Or will only electrum open up these 12 words.
@_date: 2014-08-11 03:32:48
I got that joke. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 04:46:22
haha. love the title OP. I have no idea what he just said.
@_date: 2015-05-25 06:57:49
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:01:36
So is my pos car. I guess it's worth it's weight in gold too?
@_date: 2014-02-02 20:29:00


You had me until "MySQL" and "Jade"
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:08:05
i assumed it was that forum.

@_date: 2015-05-24 08:42:42
the homepage looks like it's a photograph of a desktop stream. I wonder if I misread that. If i'm going to present something I want to show my screen more than my ugly mug.
@_date: 2015-05-24 08:28:58
Reminds me of the dotcom boom. I really haven't seen anything like it since. Besides that runup to 1200.
@_date: 2014-01-23 04:18:58
That doesn't mean it can't be done. Alpha-T seems to be progressing nicely.
@_date: 2014-07-05 21:39:52
Ok, thanks.
@_date: 2014-10-18 05:52:50
chuck norris can own Symbian
@_date: 2014-02-18 03:46:25
that's awesome. my wife would be pissed.
@_date: 2014-02-03 00:05:19
oh man, fuck mtgox. go to btc-e.
@_date: 2014-02-03 00:02:51
i missed it.
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:42:06
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:46:38
That's right. Or they just mine alts on their GPUs.
@_date: 2014-10-18 04:43:21
which game? what time, what channel?
@_date: 2014-08-15 03:49:31
i reckon the man has a point.
@_date: 2014-10-18 05:49:31
Just don't be surprised when you get invaded and put back on the greenback.
@_date: 2014-08-09 17:14:02
So using n word is a great reference now. What are you some kind of jackass?
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:01:05
In Mark's defense, I don't think he really knows.
@_date: 2015-05-14 20:20:07
The A-players get a month off. B-players get 1-2 weeks max. Been this way at every company.
@_date: 2015-05-24 07:37:11

You bring up a good point about how *all* the money laundering is happening on btc-e now. Its only a matter of time before US gov't catches up to them.
I have left this exchange. But I still appreciate the fact that I don't have to risk having my identity stolen because some schmucks running an exchange required it and then later got hacked.

I'm treating it like property actually. Property that appreciates. In my parent's generation, houses were 20-40k to purchase a 4BR house. Now that house is worth nearly a million dollars. 
I don't think real estate is going to go from 800k-1m right now to 400M in 20 years (of course, who knows what the dollar has in store for us)...but if that happens, salaries will still be shitty and everything else unaffordable.
If Bitcoin appreciates as I suspect it will. I mean its a virtual fucking currency. I can send it from anywhere to anywhere like a god damn email. W/O any interferance from anyone. That is huge. People don't realize it yet because they are living in fear....especially here in the US.
All it takes is for someone like Hive or Coinbase or another yet to be formed company to make it 100% usable that even your average moron can use it w/o fucking losing his money.

I'm not sure what you were really expecting, nobody here really gives a shit about Bitcoin despite the positive news in the past year. 99% of people haven't even heard of it and the other 1% who have think it's a scam or a joke. The one guy in a position of power I know of (architect at an incubator) who *did* understand bitcoin (or so I thought at the time, as he gave a presentation to the company about it and understood the ins-and-outs of the cryptography aspect) now thinks poorly of it because he lost everything in MtGox.
I still don't know anyone that uses it besides the people at my Bitcoin meetup (and many of them were total kooks). I've been following bitcoin since that first cyprus runup from $4 to $240. And since then I've only met one other Bitcoin guy in real life at a coffee shop. and this is the heart of silicon valley.
The 2 or 3 shops I called on coinmap.org all had stopped accepting it awhile ago.

Yeah. I think a lot of people like it because they think they'll get rich off it. Myself included.
But the real appeal is that its deflationary. Our government has fucked up the monetary policy so bad, there's not much else we can do. But reboot. I'm not willing to put 100% of my wealth into something like bitcoin in its current form. But I'm willing to diversify and risk a little to see what happens.

Seriously. open source p2p money and the best we can do for integration is Coinbase and BitPay? C'mon guys.

exactly my point. nobody is going to this mainstream.
I think full nodes should get transaction fees. That way miners can get the 25 Bitcoin reward for mainting their super computers, and the rest of us can help keep it decentralized simply by processing transactions.

i'm just fuckin' with you. There are a lot more than 17k transactions. I think each block is 10MB for some reason. I don't know why, but that's how it works. A new block is created roughly every 10 minutes....so since 2009 that's a lot of blocks.
There are clients that will run off a hosted blockchain, like electrum so   you don't have to download the whole thing.

i don't know what that means or how to do it.
@_date: 2015-07-15 07:39:47
yes. i know how open source works...but some of the most insecure bug riddled software on the web is open source. So just because its open source doesn't mean its bug free. That's all I'm saying....and Bitcoin is mostly amateur programmers at this point. I would not be surprised at all if there was a critical bug that is undiscovered.

Its a moot point. I get my healthcare through my job because there's no way I could afford $1800/month for my family out of pocket. But when I retire, I have no idea what I'm going to do...because obviously I won't be shelling out $1800.

western union is cumbersome and not usable. have you ever used western union? Bitcoin is going to replace credit cards online....eventually.
I feel much better paying in bitcoin than i do credit card. I have full control. I don't have to worry about cancelling payment if it doesn't work out, i don't have to worry about someone's datbase getting hacked revealing my identity/addresss/password.
I can literally send you $500 right now if i wanted. and nobody could stop us. you could accept it for free. You don't have to get a bank account or pay merchant fees or collect any info on me.
@_date: 2015-04-04 09:15:38
you provide no proof or evidence, just your word.
we can always fork and put it into a new foundation. that's what happened with io.js/node.js
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:03:12
I had this same problem the other day.
They gave me an address which was good for 12 minutes.
I sent payment immediately, and they never received it. I sent them the link to the transaction, they pretty much said "well we never received it"...and asked if I had sent it after 12 minutes.
This time window for payment thing has got to go.
I was able to get them to honor the payment, but it didn't exactly inspire trust in the system when payments don't even arrive.
@_date: 2015-09-14 06:30:06
not reasonably no. you could use shapeshift.io to money launder it but i think 48k is above their limit.

The easiest thing is to setup a wallet at home on your laptop where you keep all you coins. I would use either electrum or  multibit as these are the easiest to use. Just be sure you backup your private key....somewhere offsite.
Then setup a free wallet (this will be your petty cash wallet that you accept payment from). You can get this at blockchain.info.
So you have them send payment to the blockchain.info wallet and then as soon as its there you send it away to your multibit wallet at home.

same thing happened with joyent/node so they formed a committed and forked node.js into io.js
it literally forced joyent's hand to make a standards body. something like that could work for bitcoin. 
it doesn't surprise me considering they were a bunch of criminals running the foundation.

no the whole point of bitcoin is you can cash out for dollars. you can't send dollars over the internet and using credit cards w/ your personal info is risky. With bitcoin I can pay anyone anywhere at anytime and not worry about my identity stolen. If the merchant cashes out or spends his bitcoin i could care less.
@_date: 2015-04-04 05:13:41
of course. who doesn't want dollars?

Because I kind of think that's true for both. I've been using Bitcoin more lately, just small things 5 bucks here, 10 there. Its really quite handy just transferring value anywhere. Amazing how people are so brainwashed they can't even understand the concept at all.

@_date: 2015-02-21 10:17:55
i don't think bitcoin will ever go that low unless there is a fatal flaw in the software that allows bitcoins to be stolen w/o the private key.
i've explained bitcoin to some really smart people....and they simply don't get it. Bitcoin's roots are based in F-the-system, most people don't have this mentality, so they are not going to come to it with an open mind. They will believe Mark Karpeles ran the Bitcoin Ponzi scheme and Satoshi Nakamoto sold drugs on Silk Road.
Unless you have the FU-mentality, (i personally chalk it up to listening to heavy metal as a kid and punk later on)...then I probably never would have glanced at bitcoin. I used to listen to a lot of Rage Against the Machine back in the day, so whenever something comes along that is about taking the power back and all that I tend to look into it a bit. It's basically why I love open source and never touched that proprietary crap.

@_date: 2015-02-21 08:07:24
AS TRANSACTIONS/SECOND GROW, THE TRANSACTIONS FEE WILL START TO ADD UP....AS TIME GOES ON THE BITCOIN REWARD IS HALVED EVERY 4 YEARS, EVENTUALLY THERE WILL BE NO MORE BITCOIN REWARD....BUT PRESUMABLY THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS IN EACH BLOCK WILL BE QUITE LARGE, WHERE THE TRANSACTION FEE OUTWEIGHS THE BITCOIN REWARD...THUS CONTINUING TO INCENTIVIZE MINERS TO KEEP MINING.

@_date: 2013-09-21 03:36:21
I don't know. I think the minimum is like 5 cents.
I heard on "Coinsidder This" podcast that some country created an altcoin based on Bitcoin simply to reduce the transaction fee, because 5 cents was still a lot of money in their country.
I thought you could actually make the transaction fee 0...but the clients started enforcing a minimum.

Great to see someone who can shed some light. I just read there is no statute of limitations on tax evasion (blockchain is public record and will likely be analyzed in the future by IRS), so I want to be sure I do this reporting properly, even if it is on the honor system.

about 10 years ago when I was working at a large company, we spoke with several mobile carriers about how to create a mobile payments system (this was before iphones, et. al). They revealed that encryption only went as far as the server, they then decrypted all the data, inspected it and then re-encrypted it before it got to the phone. Their analogy was "unwrapping gifts and then rewrapping them before you put them under the tree". This was the language commonly used to describe the process.

What I'm saying is the web 2.0 "rockstar" frameworks are a little outdated. I suggest you learn Javascript. It's the only thing that matters.
You can build your entire app in javascript. Including backend code with Node.js. There are starting to be some real nice frameworks emerging on this front as well: Backbone, Angular-js, Meteorite, and now Hood.ie which looks very promising.

@_date: 2013-04-22 07:45:35
my bad. i didn't fully understand from your OP.
Coinbase isn't really trustworthy anyway. For many reasons. They leaked address/phone info of their merchants allowing them to be publicly crawlable (they say you agreed to do this as a merchant, but I never entered any information when I created my "buy now" button)...they shoulnd't have posted my name, and address and email. I intentionally left it blank, thinking I would be somewhat anonymous and they used all my real account info instead since I didn't provide anything. Had I known, I would have changed my info. Also, they are only 2-3 employees. Its no wonder it takes forever to get the coins, even if you are lucky enough to buy them. Most of the time its not even possible. I used them to buy my few coins, then disconnected all my bank info and moved my coins out. As I don't really trust a 2-man operation using bootstrap with my money.

i told my wife it was distributed, can't be shut down because its not centralized or regulated/controlled by anyone. And sending money anywhere in the world was as easy as sending an email. And the result is a true "free market"...and incase the dollar crashes, we should probably buy a little bit now so we have something.

@_date: 2013-04-22 07:40:24
anything to do with the banks is a major hassle. I transferred money from bank to dwolla to gox, and it took like 10 days. Its not just coinbase. Funding with bank to buy btc is a major pita. The only easy way to get them is to start accepting them as payment.
@_date: 2013-04-09 08:17:02

will the transaction fee be enough to cover the cost of running a node/mining? that is the question. Right now I think the average is anywhere between .0005 to .0001 -- that's about 5 cents to a penny. I have no idea how many transactions a single miner can process in an hour....but it doesn't sound like it'll add up to much from what I hear.

a couple of bucks won't make any difference. I've been waiting for MtGox to approve me, and have watched the price go up 30 bucks. I still think its a deal at $100. I'm going to get my hands on 10 BTC and then call it quits. I'll get back to you in 2019 to see how much they are worth. By the way, if you want to day trade currency i would play with thinkorswim play money for like a year before you use real money. I've been doing it 2 months and so far have lost about $20,000 of fake money. I'm just glad I wasn't using real money to realize I have no idea how this shit works -- so I'm long on BTC.

I get all that. And I watched the video on the OP link. But I don't understand what a wifi mesh network does.
The video pretty much described how the regularly internet works, so I'm not sure what a mesh network is or how its different.
Also, we all rely on telecom companies for Internet access...so building a network on top of that access seems like it is not truly free. It could still be controlled. Much like Bittorrent and 6-strikes law is doing.

So I would guess 4 days or so for you if you've already added your bank.

if the fees go up then you have a point. that's my main concern with bitcoin, as mining becomes less and less profitable, the required fees will have to go up to keep the network running. This could be much higher than any credit card or bank charge in the future.
Right now its about 5 cents/transaction. In the future though, it might be $5-100/transaction.

There are quite a few hurdles for widespread adoption, but I think that will only get easier with services like Coinbase, and as Bitcoin clients become easier to use.

too early to tell imo.
i've read some VCs were going to through some money at Bitcoin related projects. But the biggest hurdle is widespread adoption. When the average techie thinks its a ponzi scheme, there's no way it will be accepted by the masses. For me it took a ton of research and reading to even understand how it worked.
There will be a few companies that will accept it, but I think those will largely remain in the few. And only done where it makes sense (Expensify for example).

do you actually have to be a BOFA customer? Or can anyone go in off the street and do this transaction w/o having to open an account with BOFA?
@_date: 2013-03-30 01:00:34
you can't buy through them though unless you're lucky enough to hit their seemingly window of 1-2 nanoseconds per day.

I think there are a lot of programmers and designers who would like to get paid in bitcoin I've only used odesk and fiverr but something in the middle I think would be good.

Mining seems more like a small business than an investment to me (not advisor).

agreed. I'm doing the same.
@_date: 2013-04-22 07:47:46
they will slip up sooner or later and get hacked. Good luck with that one if your bank account is connected. I only keep $100 in my connected bank account w/o any overdraft protection...in the case of someone actually hacking paypal (one of the tricks I learned working there).
@_date: 2013-04-06 17:37:10

this process made me realize how great Bitcoin is once I actually got my hands on some. Now I just do my wallet -&gt; recipient with a click of a button and its done in a few minutes.
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:49:15
don't feel bad. i heard about a 4 year old boy that got a sexual offender mark on his school record for kissing another girl on the hand. If it were my kid, I'd sue the school.
@_date: 2013-04-25 05:52:46
its called "arbitrage" and is very common. Exchanges are just like stores. You may pay more money for the same tv at Best Buy vs. Amazon.
@_date: 2013-04-09 09:13:16
Whatever. Whoever is selling stuff online. I'm posing this question to retailers mainly. They should be offering a 10% discount to their customers when they pay with Bitcoin.
As a marketing strategy, you would be encouraging the use of bitcoin, lowering your transaction fees, and probably have a big gain on your holding the bitcoin for the time being.
@_date: 2013-08-29 06:45:11
That's all web 2.0 crap. Why not pick up a 2013 technology like angular-js or hood.ie.

I see. Been a victim of that as well. I don't run channels on Freenode anymore because someone will just strip it away eventually. If it gets popular enough I'm sure someone will start a freenode channel.

yup, bitcoin will be promoted by the government as "only used by terrorists."

Seeking Alpha has redeemed itself a bit from their previous article:
@_date: 2013-04-27 06:44:16
uh. are you suggesting it won't be $300 USD if I pay in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-22 08:01:24
I suggest we make Bitcoin day November 1. The day Satoshi Nakamoto posted his paper online.
@_date: 2013-04-02 05:05:29
It's a big risk and if you're living paycheck to paycheck I don't recommend you invest in something so volatile. It reminds me of Internet stocks with300% gains and then one day ghey are worthless .    Only invest what you can afford to loose .  And if you bought 10 bucks worth and it goes up you would still have some btc to use 
@_date: 2013-04-20 01:24:52
They would instantly be accepting payments globally. I really don't understand why people don't jump aboard bitcoin payments when doing business

The the question we all have...and the implication .... what if it doesn't corrrect? You keep waiting for how long? I give myself a month and I'll take another look and decide whether or not I want to continue to buy. After 6 months of steady gains, I will likely do a regular savings plan investment.
@_date: 2013-08-29 04:50:35

yeah, nobody stopped programming in java because of a few highly publicized security holes. But only time will tell. I could not understand BTC. I downloaded the client software and waited about 2 weeks of 24/7 processing of "the ledger" or "block chain" -- I finally gave up on that nonsense and just used coinbase.com

@_date: 2013-04-11 06:32:34
i mean i want to be wealthy with Bitcoin (in 5-10 years). But given today, I think most people are looking more short term than that.
I won't even bother trading with such crappy platforms. TDAmeritrade needs to take over this MtGox crap.

that's some bullshit liberal rhetoric that people are or aren't greedy. Of course I"m greedy, I have a family to feed and people I'm responsible for. I'll try to earn as much money as I can and pay as little taxes as possible on it.

I trust bitcoin has been vetted enough to guarantee nobody can control it.

Go for it
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:10:35
Yeah. I don't see why everyone is hating on btce. I think it's great and the fact that their owners wish to remain anonymous doesn't bother me much in the least. I find it less likely they will get raided and my coins frozen.

i feel the same way. people just laugh when I mention Bitcoin. So no more. They can learn about it and buy some in a few years. for 10k/ea
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:12:07
this is probably the best advice. I plan on doing the same. I might actually wait a little bit, to see what happens over a month or so. But this could entirely replace a 401k.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:12:15
what i heard was each person can do 1000/day and they have 22 people doing it. So that is much much  more than 1000/day. That means the overflow is at 17k and they are doing around 22k/day of verifications. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 08:29:53
thats the beauty of bitcoin, once you get some, they are open 24/7 and even on holidays.

@_date: 2013-03-29 06:42:47
...and can't they hire a damn designer. All these bitcoin sites look like a jr. high student created them. Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. I tried searching for a MtGox iPhone app, and their official app is only available on Cydia (a site for installing stolen apps on a jail broken iPhone)....doesn't inspire much confidence either.
@_date: 2013-06-03 04:26:48
As a parent I can understand why, when you're a kid you don't really have much disposable income to throw away on long shot investments. I wouldn't advice my kids to buy Bitcoin either...although if they really did their research and understood what they were getting into, maybe a few dollars worth to see how it goes.

I saw it on a billboard on Lawrence expressway in Sunnyvale,ca. It's still there looks like a shady memory dealer  -- now if we can just go from this questionable piece of advertising, to an prominent display in Times Square, maybe it'll get some acceptance and some people talking...the billboard has been there for a few years at least.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:18:52
i would never use a web site with a trademarked name in it. Proof they are amateurs and have no idea about how to do business online, and will likely get shut down if they aren't already scamming people.
@_date: 2013-03-30 00:52:02
they never open their window to buy.
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:11:48
you probably should look into sockets. Most mtgox charts I've seen in realtime are using sockets, not long polling.
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:25:40
maybe they only allow you to buy in chunks of 100. Within normal trading ranges so it would be more difficult to trace.

Bank -&gt; Dwolla -&gt; MtGox. You do have to get verified at MtGox go which can take a few days. Also ACH transfers take time as well.
Also, you can do Bank -&gt; Coinbase but their supply is very limited.
There's also Bitfloor, which should be quicker from what I heard. I haven't used them.
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:31:48

i encourage people to comment on these mainstream news articles. Most people have no idea what bitcoin is.

i thought it was legit for a second.

It's just a negative way to slam bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:07:42
yeah, i think it was the bloomberg interview from about a month ago. He did seem to not be too concerned about, just kind of laughed at how he though $100 was worth selling when had he held it, it would be 500k. 
@_date: 2013-03-31 05:56:25
Thinkorswim forex for btc
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:53:11
so presumably you have a bank account connected to bitcoin somehow?
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:08:10
i had no idea my email address and real name was going out to the public.
@_date: 2013-03-30 10:13:50
well for me, i'm not 100% convinced bitcoin will succeed. So I'm only investing a few hundred bucks right now. If it does take off (in a year or two is still rising) i might make it my new 401k savings plan.
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:50:28
can you add your Tip address to

@_date: 2013-03-31 06:23:13
It reminds me of when the mainstream news would talk about " this thing called the Internet" 
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:03:02
was it an online wallet? Can you elaborate on your setup?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:30:24
Now they really will get hacked..
@_date: 2013-05-06 03:30:49
The one glaring problem I have with bitcoin is the size of blockchain needed to download. Could you imagine in order to send someone a dollar you had to wait for every transaction ever done in usd to download? 
The selling point and one advantage of bitcoin is that it's perfect for mricrotransactions
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:22:47
Yes, that's all its for. Go report now.
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:12:27
i don't think it was a coordinated attack. I think it all the sites were overloaded. I've been watching news on bitcoin for the past 24 hours, every day. ... and its been pretty dead, and it blew up again today with news about the sell off....that just causes more people to go to all these sites.
@_date: 2013-03-30 08:28:34
You can trade bit coins on mtgox fund it with Dwolla that is connected to your bank but don't put in what you are not willing to lose
@_date: 2013-04-25 06:01:14

@_date: 2013-04-11 08:57:16
lets see if we can break 500 this time.
@_date: 2013-06-13 07:50:43
I agree. I walked away from a startup that had raised 500k. In my mind, that's not even 6 months to get a project up and running.

thank fucking god...something of quality from the bitcoin world. I have been looking for this for awhile now. All the iTunes podcasts have been abandoned.
Can you add mp3s to iTunes?
Excellent show guys!
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:58:16
no, they really posted that ;)
@_date: 2013-04-23 06:50:59
i can't for the life of me find the post. but there was one person who demonstrated it could be worth $48 million / BTC.
I think that's only if the world uses bitcoin *for everything*.
I think 1000/BTC isn't unrealistic in the next 1-2 years.
More conservative estimates have it around 100k/btc in about 10 years.
@_date: 2013-03-29 06:13:14
yeah, thats the thing that makes 'em not really trustworthy. They raised some capital recently. But not being able to buy BTC is why I left. I'll still use 'em for an occassional transaction. But someone can hack them and suck your ACH connected account dry.
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:12:05
I also think ditch the us flag
@_date: 2013-05-22 05:53:34
Yeah. no way i'm giving my phone number to a random bitcoin web site without a little reassurance.

doesn't seem like overflow to me, looks like they just changed their UI period.
@_date: 2013-06-03 04:14:10
Its was a risk then, it's a risk now. I could have bought domains back in 1995, but it was a risk then. There's nothing to really ensure bitcoin is a success. Infact, with the recent government moves to stop US from funding mtgox, I would say it looks like its days are numbered.
I hope I'm wrong. i like Bitcoin and what it represents. But to invest more than you can afford to loose at this point is just foolish.
@_date: 2013-09-09 09:12:27

can I get a flow chart for that?
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:39:46
its not a very "wise" investment unless you truly believe Bitcoin will succeed longterm. Tell him its like investing $1k in domains back in 1995....and then selling them 10 years later for millions. That seemed to drive the point across with my wife.
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:36:45
coinbase or blockchain for onlne. Multibit for desktop.
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:57:56
not exactly sure what i'm looking at there.

treat it like a 401k -- invest a little bit each paycheck.  You will come out ahead in the long run.
@_date: 2013-04-25 06:48:49
"Bitcoin exchangers and miners must be required to register as Money Service Businesses under the Bank Secrecy Act" -- are miners included in this? I thought it was just exchanges.
I didn't really see the "Should we worry" argument anywhere, it was pretty much just a primer on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:56:54
i see. that makes sense.
@_date: 2013-09-13 02:31:14
Exactly. I think I'll just hold onto bitcoins for now. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:26:01

@_date: 2013-04-23 07:23:55
@_date: 2013-04-07 07:50:58
what you're doing is effectively saying "This internet thing won't go anywhere, I can count the number of web sites on one hand". Fast foward 15 years and well....you get the idea.

The internet was pretty difficult to use back in the day. All it takes is some innovation. It will change. And yes, it is *very* difficult to know how to do it properly. That is a huge hurdle for widespread adoption.

Use coinbase.com -- but don't leave your coins there for very long. Online wallets have a bad habit of getting hacked. Once you get the coins you can easily transfer them to your local wallet on your computer.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:29:20
ok, i guess i was way off.
@_date: 2013-04-14 01:02:05
fuck captvchas.
@_date: 2013-04-25 06:00:18
how ironic, you trade bitcoin at a bank.
@_date: 2013-04-22 07:23:43
update: i guess it does long polling every few seconds, and the market is barely moving right now.
@_date: 2013-04-15 05:25:02
i don't have that kind of time.
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:05:44
hell yes its wishful thinking. and the logic actually breaks down because if bitcoin became the world's currency, there would be no dollar to compare it to. I'm just pointing out what I read. I'm not saying I believe it.
I think 100K/BTC is attainable if BTC becomes world's currency.
If you take 60 trillion (transactional currency world wide) and divide by let's say 15 million (number of bitcoins in circulation by the time this happens). YOu get about $4,000,000/BTC -- but I don't think that will happen for a very long time. so just a fraction of that, might get us to 100k/btc.

This is compete bs. While I did use the merchant button I never filled out any personal info you guys just leak my personal infomation without even telling me. I have discontinued use of your site and I highly recommend people delink their bank accounts so they don't get sucked dry should some one gain access. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 17:36:31
i heard you guys were a scam.
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:31:51
still single i see.
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:32:41
still good they are acknowledging it. i'm sure they are drooling over the potential of becoming the next mtgox.
@_date: 2013-04-02 05:29:09
I like it for both reasons political and profit. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:12:05
I used coinbase. can't complain. but their buy windows are impossible to catch. I guess I just got lucky a few times. I wouldn't trust them with my wallet though incase they get hacked...ok i guess all i did *was* complain.
I also used Dwolla -&gt; MtGox funding. Haven't actually done any trading with MtGox but it took about 10 days to setup.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:42:46
I went with coinbase, then quickly realized after they put all my contact info on the web without telling me, that I didn't trust them very much anymore. So I moved everything to my private wallet on my computer (using Multibit) and sent $20 to a blockchain.info wallet so I could have a wallet with some coffee money on my phone. I don't really trust coinbase, seeing as they only have 2 employees.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:30:20
I went from 4k to verified in 2 days. But i guess all that has changed. And I don't know where I read those numbers...i thought they were from them.

@_date: 2013-04-25 09:31:10
i figured as much. Multibit allows you to go as low as .0001 so I'm just curious if BC did as well.

yeah. if you are ok with denying it completely. But I think a forensics person could check for a hidden encrypted drive, then court could still compel you to open it.
@_date: 2013-06-03 04:16:06
That's what I would say at this point, no more than 1% of an investment portfolio. If it goes up over time and stabilizes, maybe that numbers goes up to 5%.

My thoughts exactly.
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:56:58
you're disgusted with all the greed around money? This is probably not a good place for you to be, consider Bitcoin is a developing currency.
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:46:54
might have more success over at bittalk.org they have miner forum there. I personally have no idea. I heard GPU mining was dead though and ASIC will be by the time they ship.

Oh yeah. I get that at work. "Definitely a ponzi scheme, and the creators are the benefactors."
@_date: 2013-04-22 08:23:06
Yes. Just think of your bitcoin wallet as an email account. You can both send receive from it. You can create a new receiving address for each transaction or use the same. Its more like a wildcard email address &lt;anything&gt; will go to you. But if I understand correctly, you can only spend coins out of the adress you receive them at...so you should probably look into this. or consolidate to one address for your balance. I'm not exactly sure how peeople manage that. I only use the one address.
Just be sure to do a proper backup of your wallet incase your HD fails or house catches fire. blockchain.info is probably the "safest" online wallet. They put a lot of effort into security and have an iPhone app as well.
I only keep $20 there though. I do remote backups offsite with my home wallet.
