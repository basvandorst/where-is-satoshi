Magic The Gathering: Online eXchange (MTGOX) swapped from fantasy card gaming to Bitcoin. Maybe now they are switching back.

Pair  (check Mt.Gox trades/uncheck Blockchain in lower left) with  (loses connection sometimes) and  (stable) and you won't miss anything (be mindful of lag).

Not personall selling, just in a conversation with some pissed-off customers.

Remember: Bitcoin earns from *public* interest

Use Getwork instead of Stratum for now.

Then take a look at 4 days  and they are above 41% (of the total hashrate in the world). BTCguild has had "market dominance" for some time.

How about 48% over the last 24 hours?

A **dystopia** is a community or society, usually fictional, that is in some important way undesirable or frightening (*Anarchy*). Dystopias are often characterized by dehumanization (*L. Bob Rife's convertees*), totalitarian governments (*Franchise-Owned Quasi-National Entities*), environmental disaster (*Sacrifice Zone*), or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society (*drug trafficking and violent crime*).

 They are at 48% over the last 24 hrs. I trust the blockchain website more than blockorigin.

It's pathetic to be down over two high-growth days. Many people want to sell.

The "Metaverse" in *Snow Crash* is a collective online shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space, including the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the internet.
The point of the post though is about the non-hyperinflated currency (i.e. Bitcoin) that is used instead of wheelbarrow-loads of dollars.
But yeah, the financial system you mention that is untraceable is another parallel from Neal Stephenson. The guy loves currencies.
