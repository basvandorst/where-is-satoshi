In those pages says that brainwallets are difficult and Electrum isn't even mentioned. If you are worried about software support for Electrum brainwallets, I, as a developer can assure that the algorythm used by Electrum is both simple and secure.

Yep, although it depends of the type of person. When I heard about bitcoin I was about to close the window when someone in a comment started to explain the technical aspects; in that moment I got very excited, even if everyone thought the coin was "dying" at the moment.
@_date: 2012-07-23 16:14:53
Thanks. I was explaining the questions more than advocating bitcoin, though.

Take a look at [this]( You'll see a list of 1626 words. Check if every word of your seed is there. If any word is not there put it here (or PM it to me). Don't send the full seed to anyone.

Both are very secure, and if you lose one of them, you can access with the other (as long as you have set both in the security center).
Yubikey has two methods (short and long press). Usually the short one is used for login and the long one for withdrawals and changes in security center; so if someone manages to intercept your short press before is processed by mtgox (which is already very difficult), the long press is not compromised.
@_date: 2012-12-11 20:04:27
Yeah. I have both google authenticator and yubikey for mtgox, but bitcoin.de doesn't offer multi-factor auth.

I'm curious... What's the word? (pm me if you prefer)
Also, I can make a script that tries with all words to find the valid wallet.

Calculating the Levenshtein distance with all words, here's the ordered list of the top 40 matches:
I'd try 'loud' for the visual similarity.
@_date: 2012-12-10 00:48:09
You need empty lines before and after he list.
@_date: 2012-12-18 14:40:28
Use [Electrum]( The first time you open it, it shows 12 words, write them down. When you open it in a different PC (or in the same PC after deleting electrum.dat), it asks you to restore the wallet by writing those 12 words.
This way you don't need to print anything or type a long and complex key. Just 12 common words.
@_date: 2012-10-17 09:31:05
Electrum uses a list of 1626 words. That's 1626^(12), roughly 2^(128). The words are given to you randomly. You *can* choose the words (as long as they are in the list) but it's not obvious in the GUI because it needs to be really random to be secure.
While 2^(128) may sound weaker than a random key of 2^(256), it takes time to check if there is money in a given wallet seed: you need to generate at least 10 keypairs from the seed (5 of the default gap limit and 5 from spare addresses) and check them against the blockchain.
TL;DR: 12 random words = very secure. 12 user chosen words = probably not secure.
Edit: To be extremly (absurdly) secure, you can use a longer seed! Take two electrum seeds (24 words), put them when regenerating the wallet. Ta da! You have an unique wallet between 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936 different combinations. (note, the wallet won't have the funds of the other two, is a completely new one).

As a Python lover, I'm sorry too for the spamming. I usually don't follow this sort of campaign, but my life is revolving around Python right now and I thought "why not?".

I cannot reproduce your problem using random words in the list, not even typing more or less than 12 words. Are you completely sure all of them is in that list? If they are but one of them is wrong, it should just show up as an empty wallet.

Use [Electrum]( it's very easy to use. Copy the 12 words of the brainwallet in a piece of paper in a secure place or several places, send funds to that wallet, then optionally destroy the wallet file. Write instructions of how to use it:
* Download [Electrum](
* When opened for the first time, click "Restore" (if it's not the first time, delete/rename electrum.dat).
* Type the 12 words.
At this point you'll have the full wallet in a very simple window like [this]( What you need now is an exchange, there are lots. The most well known right now is [MtGox]( but in your instructions you can ask to come here to and see what's the best exchange by then in your country.
When asked to send the money to an address, it's very simple:
* Type address in the address box.
* Type the quantity.
* Click send.
I guess this part won't be necessary, hopefully bitcoin will be better known by then.

The problem with keeping the battery plugged is not the constant discharging-charging, but the heat. Unless it's a very badly designed laptop, or a very noisy power source (such as cheap alternators that makes square waves instead sine waves), having it plugged in doesn't damage the battery, after 100% it just sits there unused.
@_date: 2012-11-20 11:23:50
Yes, but you would know he has intercepted the short press since it would be invalid for you.

Just try it. Try to use the same code in two places at the same time. It will always fail in one place. OTP means One Time Password, the code can be only used once. If it can be used twice, it's useless.

While it won't solve inequality, it will make it much easier to the bottom end, the long tail, the people that need just 1$ every day to live. It will make it difficult to the other extreme as well. Not being able to create money from thin air is a big deal.
Or in other perspective: a lot of wealth is created somewhere *because* someone else's wealth is worth less, and that's only possible with fiat money.
It's right, bitcoin won't make the money automatically go from the rich to the poor, but at least it would stop the opposite from happening.

**DO NOT USE MIUI, IT'S NOT OPEN SOURCE AND YOU CAN'T TRUST IT**
I lost 47 BTC last year because of **MIUI**
Please edit your post mentioning that MIUI is not open source. Schildbach's wallet is (and I bet someone already decompiled the compiled version and compared against a clean build to make sure it doesn't have a backdoor).
edit: Of course also I wouldn't trust more than $300 to other OS other than a stable mainstream linux distro (previously it was $1000)

Good idea, it has been added.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:16:01
I realized we should call electrum-like wallets *deterministic* to differenciate them from brainwallets. Deterministic wallets can be memorized, but its main purpose is to be able to backup it by hand easily, while "brainwallets" let you choose the seed (which we know it's totally wrong).
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:38:52
That's an easier way, and I hope projects such as this one facilitate replicating such environment. My wording was too vague but I meant open source = easier to audit.

**NEVER EVER** store large sums in a weak device (phone), especially if it's an old version or closed source OS. I was robbed 47 BTC back when they were 13$ worth, I was using a closed source custom Android and weveral root apps with possible security holes. Never again. My phone is only for two factor auth, maybe pocket change, and no more.

Bitcoin is a P2P protocol: your client connects to a bunch of other clients and you broadcast transactions. Each transaction is not aimed at any specific IP, it's aimed at the entire network (or more specifically, the miners). You'll be connected (through tor in this case) to a bunch of clients and no matter what clients are those, your transactions will arrive their destination, and you'll see the transactions you need to see as well.
There's the possibility of a sybil attack, but little harm can be done to you in that case. If you don't want to risk losing anonimity, find bitcoin .onion peers (instead of using exit nodes).

I suggest changing the brainwallets section: they are secure **if and only if** they're totally random. E.g. Electrum's (which basically is XKCD method with 12 words).
If one chooses a written piece of literature, no matter how obscure and unknown it is, it's insecure.
The golden rule: **Don't choose the words. And don't let anyone choose the words.** Only a program or a dice.

I have a NAND dump of the phone after the events but I doubt I can prove it (time spent looking for evidence is not worth it). Anyway conditions were similar to this one, except that the coins were stolen from an exchange (the only one I used without 2FA at the time), where the password was accidentally saved in the browser, and compromised. I know my PC is not compromised because I only use open source software and I would have robbed more times after if that were the case.
Even if I can't prove it, using a non open source version of an open source OS made and packaged by too many untrusted people (including unofficial translators) and which communicates frequently with *MIUI's servers* is a really **bad** idea.
Also, my point is that if we can guess who's the culprit, MIUI is a much more likely candidate than Schildbach's wallet which is open source and it's a much smaller piece of code than a *whole OS*. There's a third posibility, and that's using a f-droid/google play app with root access. None of OP's apps are the ones that I used, which are open source too but I don't discard the possibility of a malicious build. Again, what are the odds of small and well known open source apps vs. big (and somewhat obscure) closed source OS that calls home for too many things?

It's a different bytecode but it's not native. There are both dex decompilers and dex-&gt;jar converters to use decompilers for the original java's format.
Java decompilations are usually more readable than native ones because you can still discern original classes.

Bitcoin is the best payment system in existence: instant, secure, safe, anonymous and cheap. It's the only way of sending __any__ quantity of wealth to __any__ point of the globe, and instantly.
As time passes, several things become clear:
* It is a viable alternative.
* It's slowly becoming ubiquitous.
* More users = more services, and more services = a more useful coin.
So, whenever you use it for something or just for saving... go buy coins!
@_date: 2013-05-20 13:22:04
In that case the value it's in the imposibility of reversing transactions. The quote now begins with "You can't counterfeit or reverse a Bitcoin transaction.". The amount of money needed to do that is extremely high. Also the previous bubble showed us that the mining power won't drop to unsustainable levels (which is what killed most alt-chains).
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:36:19
I doubt is that huge. It's made in Java and only the message-relaying part needs to be monitorized. There's only three types of messages: when you ask other nodes for blocks and set bloom filters, when you relay messages you received as-is, and when you make a transaction. Remember nothing in the bitcoin protocol is encrypted. All is signing and hashing and relaying an unsolicited TX would be very suspicious.
Also, as said, there's an easier way of making sure an open source project is not compromised.
@_date: 2013-05-20 07:21:05
I think it was just a browser password stealer, the thief saw "bitcoin" in the name of the site and gave it a try.
