I used to like Coinbase but they're starting to piss me off.  I purchased my first coin to initiate the 30 day wait period.  Finally became Level 2 with a 50 BTC instant buying ability.  I LOVED IT!  Then some incident came up and they dropped the 50 BTC instant limit to 10 BTC.  Yesterday I go to buy some more coins and all of a sudden I have to add a credit card (that can't be used to purchase coins but will be used as a backup???) in order to get my 10 BTC instantly.  It says I wouldn't get it until Monday.  That's an entire week!!
What kind of BS is this?  They already have my bank account information and I've been Level 2 verified for over 2 months.  What does having a credit card that can't even be used to purchase coins have to do with me getting instant coins?  I sent them an email complaining and I highly doubt I'll get a response.  Such a joke.

Are you saying in order to access the site you will have to pay a small fee in BTC and the site will be advertisement free? 
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:02:05
I had posted in on the SR subreddit this...
Create a secure website that holds BTC exchanges between P2P in Escrow (while taking a small percent of the amount being held) to pay for operations and what not.
A buyer and vendor message/email on a separate secured and encrypted site that's not affiliated with the Escrow site. An agreement is made and the buyer signs into the Escrow site and generates a "Purchase Order" which then creates a unique secured transaction page that both parties have access to.
Once the delivery is received the funds are released by the buyer. It can also have the same features as SR (autofinalize, resolution center, etc) and have Buyer/Seller stats but maybe just cryptic feedback. Basically don't say "This was the greatest MDMA I've ever had!!!" etc. 
But ideas are welcome.
We basically just need a place where we can exchange BTC for products but to have some form of security/protection so both sides don't get scammed.
Thoughts.

I use the app Coinbits and you can peg the ticker to which currency you want.  I'm using USD.  You can see all the exchanges and their prices.  Currently it shows...
mtgoxUSD: $110.00
bitstampUSD: $99.00
btceUSD: $96.90
cbxUSD: $98.00
bitboxUSD: $100.00
fbtcUSD: $96.50
crytrUSD: $97.04
bitkonanUSD: $97.00
rippleUSD: $95.00
These two are new.  Haven't seen them before.
icitUSD: $115.00
rockUSD: $115.00
You can definitely do some arbitrage if you have accounts set up in multiple exchanges. Purchase BTC at cheaper price and purchase goods from a vendor who pegs their BTC to mtgox.  You end up saving money.  You could also buy cheap and then sell off and make $10-$20. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:33:22
Sorry to hijack the thread but why does it take over a week for funds to appear in my bank account when I sell BTC but it only takes you guys a day or 2 to process a buy and charge my account?  You guys got paid in a timely fashion while my account went into overdraft and now I'm strapped for money until 6:00PM friday.  What kind of Ponzi scheme are you guys running here? 
@_date: 2013-09-11 22:34:43
No prob. Hope that helps.

Hmm. Tradehill looks like you may need some substantial capital and a business already in place (assets, website, income, etc.).  I highly doubt I would be able to qualify at this time (maybe in the future).  I appreciate the recommendation though. Thank you.

I don't see an option or anything under account settings. Where is this 30 day option?  I think I've been logged in automatically for months.  I haven't had to re-sign in since I made the account months ago (I know, very stupid and risky).  
@_date: 2013-09-07 01:09:33
Do you have an iPhone?  The app Coinbits has the majority of the exchanges and you can set it to show in various currencies.  I haven't check out all the features yet but it's pretty awesome. 
@_date: 2013-08-21 23:25:25
In Level 1 you have a buy and sell limit of 10 BTC per day.  Level 2 is buy/sell 50 BTC per day. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:22:30
You need to add a VISA (only) credit/debit card in order to get INSTANT buys.  Check the Limits/Verification section on Coinbase
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:55:49
Its already at 767
@_date: 2013-08-17 02:29:17
Yeah, I have an iPhone and I also have a level 2 set up at Coinbase.  Exactly, if a merchant pegs their BTC to an exchange with a higher BTC valuation and you're purchasing them below that value you can definitely save some money that way. 
Don't worry if you cant get the app the key here is finding merchants who peg their BTC at the higher valuation. Since mtgox was the first mover I have to assume the majority of merchants peg it to them.  
@_date: 2013-09-11 22:05:23
Here's the link to the thread that I was referring to.  I skimmed through it the other day but haven't read the whole thing.  I just know that the end result was Coinbase changing it's 50BTC instant limit to 10. 
@_date: 2013-09-11 19:07:42
I do.  Well, since you got locked out with the none of the above answer, I would choose the one that has the address that's connected to your card and business.  That should work.  If not and you feel that you've answered all the questions correctly then I would try and contact Coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:00:45
I seriously used to love them but I'm done with them now.  Missed out on a big opportunity with that correction and now they're "offline for maintenance"?  Gimme a break.  They claim they want to be the gmail of bitcoin purchasing but they're more like the USPS.

I'm joining Campbx as soon as they add ACH deposits on the 20th.  I could've gotten an additional 7 coins on that correction and I missed it because Coinbase is down and still down.  Never again. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:26:59
That makes sense.  I apologize for the accusatory post, just very frustrating when a large sum of money is missing from your bank account.  I panicked when I got the email thinking that someone had emptied my account.  And yes, this is exactly why we need Bitcoin.  Thank you for the quick and detailed response.  
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:26:33
It's about fucking time.  Getting really sick of the 10BTC only.  I don't know why they made the limit so low from 50 to 10 but glad to see they're going even higher now with 100. 
@_date: 2013-08-19 21:30:00
Fuck me.  I was just about to buy some BTC at $102, saw this thread, hit refresh and now it's $118.  WTF. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:02:59
[Coinbase]( will be the easiest for what you're trying to do.  Most of the exchanges make it difficult in getting money back in fiat (american dollars).

*boner intensifies* 
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:32:00
Did you have the message on Monday that you would receive the BTC at whatever the price was on Friday 11/22?  Many people got similar messages and by accepting that, you took the risk that Bitcoin prices could potentially rise or fall. 
If that's the case then they gave you the bitcoin equivalent of whatever the dollar amount was when you placed the order.  So say you spent $900 on Monday for 2 BTC, since the price increased that $900 only gets you 1.45714021.  Hope that makes sense. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 21:58:21
The wallet posted is the wallet the FBI sent the Silk Road seized coins to.  The wallet that is linking is stating that it allegedly could be Ross's wallet or 1 of his many wallets since some of the 600,000 BTC would more than likely have been spent since the start of SR. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:58:16
I completely understand but I shouldn't have to wait over a week and lose my instant ability until I verified my card when I had been Level 2 for a couple of months already with multiple purchases.  
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:55:00
Sorry, then I guess Coinbase is trolling but either way my emotions have been fucked with. I wanted an increase in instant buys ;___; 
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:04:32
I won't go into detail but I tried to have them cancel an order and they said I was SOL.  You can maybe try talking to your bank but I don't know if that will then flag your account making you "high risk" and what not.  
Did you have the instant or do you have to wait a few days until it arrives?  
If it's instant just be happy you got more coins and let it ride.  It's going to be more than $269 tomorrow.  If it's a few days maybe it will increase a lot more and they'll cancel it saying you're "high risk". 
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:28:30
Right and I was thinking if you and a vendor had already established a relationship/connection via other means first (mailing list or some other secure method) and this was your way to actually make the exchange possible.  I was thinking of a SR but without actually showing any product or specific listings.  Basically a secure escrow service.  
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:57:32
All these guys that want to dump just have to DDos the large exchanges. Then buy back when the price is low.  Rinse and repeat.

@_date: 2013-09-11 22:38:33
Set up an account at Virwox.  Buy Linden Dollars (Second Life currency), convert those into BTC.  However, since it's your first time you will be limited in the amount you can purchase at first and will have to wait a full 24hrs before you can purchase them again.  After about 3-4 more transactions like this your limit will increase and your wait time will decrease.

@_date: 2013-11-29 21:45:32
Yes, you can trust them but you never should have given them your login information for verification.   You should have had them made the 2 small deposits into your account which you then confirm on their site.  Never give anyone your login details to your entire account.  
Selling on Coinbase can take anywhere from 3-5 business days to reach your account.  I recently had an issue where I sold a large sum and then bought back at a lower price.  Well my bank account was charged for the buy but I wasn't credited the with the sale yet.  It overdrafted my account and I freaked out thinking someone had emptied my account but it was because the ACH times takes longer apparently.  It's annoying so just make sure you are cognizant of your funds. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:55:53
Yeah, I put in my Visa as well and will have to wait for the deposit to show up in my account first before I can verify it.  But I had purchased coins already not realizing that the instant went away. So regardless, I'm gonna have to wait a week to get them. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 13:10:08
That's odd.  I sold 10 BTC the other day when they had (what appeared to be an accident) raised their price to about $118 (mtgox's) and then when it dropped back to $102 shortly after I repurchased 11 BTC and it was in my wallet instantly.  I didn't receive an email or anything.   
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:08:19
Been with them since July this year.  Purchased my 1st coin and waited the 30 days.  I don't know why I didn't continue to purchase more throughout that time but I didn't (kicking myself now).  
When I was finally ready to move to Level 2, I passed in my first attempt.  I immediately purchased about 1k in coins.  It was instant and I loved every second of it.  It was so great knowing that I could purchase up to 50BTC instantly but due to some scamming or something they had to minimize the risk and set instant to 10BTC.  It sucks because anything over that amount you have to wait about a week and with bitcoins being so volatile you never know what's going to happen and you run the risk of them canceling the order due to being a "high risk".  I myself haven't had that happen yet (knock on wood) but I've seen many report it. 
My only complaints are: 
Lowering the instant buys: They should increase it for members who have good credit and bank accounts.  They have our info why not just increase it to those that qualify? 
Not being able to cancel an order: I had made a purchase without realizing that they changed their policy with instant buys where you needed to add a credit card.  It said I had to wait a week until I could receive the coin.  I went to cancel it and was SOL.  I contacted them and they said there was nothing they can do.  At the time I was pissed because the price was dropping and I thought I had over paid.  Fortunately, it went slightly higher and now it's worth even more so I'm glad that worked out but it could've gone the opposite.
That's pretty much the only issues I've encountered myself.  They've been a great service and are pretty convenient.  There are some legit people attached to company so I feel somewhat safe compared to say Gox, BTC-e, Bitstamp, etc.  I would be awesome if they were an exchange as well but I think the US would probably put a stop to that.  
Having said all of this, I really wish they would increase the instant buy limit for qualified people.

I'm assuming he's Level 1 verified.  Takes forever.  In order to be Level 2 you need to purchase Bitcoins, wait 30 days, then answer some questions.  Once you're Level 2 all transactions (Buy/Sell) are instant.  
While waiting for my 30 days, I would constantly read horror stories about people having trouble answering the questions and not getting verified and having to wait an additional 24 hours each time.  Fortunately for me I was able to be Level 2'd on my first attempt.  Buying and selling is so easy now.  It's literally in my account in seconds.  I love Coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-08-19 21:49:39

@_date: 2013-11-19 03:06:59
No, I know but they hire all these big players and make all these claims but they can't handle any of the ups and downs. It's frustrating and it doesn't help that it's a pain in the ass to get USD into the other exchanges.

@_date: 2013-11-28 07:04:40
Yes, Coinbase can be trusted.  Just don't give them your account login information.  Have them make the 2 small deposits which you will confirm once they show up in your account.  They're 100% legit.

I'm just waiting for Amazon to buy Coinbase.  Think Ebay buying Paypal. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 14:16:38
Yeah, this is what I'm concerned about.  If they can mess with a larger exchange such as MtGox who knows what they can/will do to the smaller guys.  I don't think I'll be doing close to $5k a day in purchasing items but like I mentioned I just want to have something in place in case things  start doing really well.  Is btc-e a possibility? 
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:49:17
This.  Have Coinbase make the 2 small deposits and then confirm them in a day or 2.  I don't care how "secure" or "safe" a company is, I would never give them my login information for my entire bank account. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:59:19
You can lend and borrow on Bitfinex.  A lot of people use it to short bitcoins.

I too am Level 2 verified.  I have my bank account linked and transfers are instantaneous.  *Knock on wood* I've never had an issue with the site or purchasing (never been flagged). 
However, it appears that an issue came up where someone's account was hijacked and the 50 BTC instant limit was used.  Coinbase has now changed their instant policy from 50BTC to 10 BTC instantly.  You can still purchase 50BTC a day, however, only 10 coins will be in your account instantly which is kind of frustrating.  
Other than that Coinbase has been great.

Last I saw is that they extended ACH deposits until the Nov 27th.  Who knows if that will happen.  I'm still seeing a lot of current complaints on their FB page in regards to deposits, transfers, withdrawals, getting verified, etc.  I sent in my verification form last week, still no word but I might just avoid them completely until they get their shit together.

@_date: 2013-11-26 22:03:52
I haven't checked in some time since I have accounts on actual exchanges now but you can make an account on Virwox and buy Linden Dollars (Second Life) and then convert those to BTC.  Since you're new you'll be limited in the amount you can purchase and the time frame between each transaction (iirc its about 24 hours). The more times you purchase though the quicker the transactions become and you're amount increases as well.  
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:20:59
If you are just level 1 it will take about a week until they show up in your account.  If you add a VISA (only) credit/debit card then you can get to Level 2 and buy instantly. 
Edit: Also, check the Limits/Verification section on Coinbase.  It will explain what you need to do.
