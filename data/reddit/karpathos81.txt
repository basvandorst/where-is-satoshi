The bitly link is a dead giveaway that it is a scam, too. Nobody will send you 24 Bitcoins via URL shortener. Total phishing attempt.
@_date: 2019-07-02 03:21:33
This is true. +1
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:22:47
I'm kind of leaning that way also. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:21:51
Nobody knows for sure. That's true. I'm asking for honest speculation. That's all. If everyone knew how to time the market, everyone would be rich, right?
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:19:27
How did I know someone was going to say that? Figures that someone would troll the post. 
@_date: 2015-05-16 14:49:05
I think I'm late to the party too. :(

I believe it's the best way outside of GDAX if you want to pay the least amount of fees as possible and don't mind waiting to receive your BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:50:04
I'd suggest a hardware wallet like a Trezor, or Ledger Nano S. You would have full control of your private keys.
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:26:04
I'll take Bitcoin over Bitcoin Cash any day. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 00:29:56
That's what I do. I buy small amounts on a regular basis to bring my dollar cost average down. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:41:11
Or a Trezor wallet. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:11:51
I have a Trezor and use that as well. Hardware wallets are definitely the way to go. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:47:06
Trezor hardware wallet. You have full control over your private keys also with it. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:55:01
I know exactly how you feel. I remember learning about Bitcoin around that timeframe as well, and when I asked one of my tech minded friends about it, his response was, "it's a really bad idea to invest in that". Hmm. Going from $10.00/coin to almost $6,100/coin a couple years later doesn't seem like it would have been a bad investment, right? Moral of the story is that I won't take financial advice from friends anymore. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:21:44
Yes. And get a hardware wallet like Trezor, and you also control your private keys that way. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:56:46
I use a Trezor wallet. It's safe, and I have full control over my private keys. Totally recommend investing in a Trezor, but I'm not sure if you were to buy one today, you'll receive it before the Bitcoin Gold fork on the 25th.

I think as more people become educated in the Bitcoin phenomenon, it will become a more widely accepted financial instrument. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:58:54
That hat is badass. That is all.
@_date: 2015-04-21 03:08:27
I wasn't born in Greece, and live in the US, but I am 100% Greek and could speak the language as well. I think my countrymen/women would benefit from Bitcoin if they were educated on the technology. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:43:57
Trezor wallet.
@_date: 2015-04-12 07:29:27
@_date: 2015-04-07 02:05:16
Bitcoin is awesome.
@_date: 2018-04-26 01:22:31
That's awesome! I wish I was in Chicago to see it to show support for a fellow Greek! Enjoy the presentation.
@_date: 2015-04-21 03:08:49
He's definitely Greek, yes.
@_date: 2015-03-17 02:35:26
This is definitely a good example why Bitcoin would have been a wise choice to handle this kind of transaction. I'm sorry that you had such a difficult time getting your money. I would have been pretty pissed also.
@_date: 2015-03-17 02:30:28
I'm a Coinbase user and haven't had any problems with them at all. If you don't want to wait the four business days to receive your Bitcoin, you can add a VISA credit card as a "backup" option, but the funds will come out of your checking account (primary option), and you will get your coins instantly. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 00:24:11
@_date: 2015-02-13 03:03:51
I agree with you. I think Bitcoin is here to stay, regardless of whether Coinbase does well or not.
@_date: 2015-02-13 03:21:05
That's awesome! I think it's neat that kids are learning about Bitcoin from such an early age. 
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:00:31
I agree. The OP should short it then. Then he can laugh at the rest of us and buy a yacht or something. ��
@_date: 2015-02-13 01:44:56
I personally like Coinbase, and hope they do well. I would totally recommend them to anyone that is looking to get a "wallet". I do feel that they will try to expand, especially if the demand for the currency goes up.
