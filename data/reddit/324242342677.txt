You skid. You know that can be used to steal BTC just like XSS can, directly from the user, but its still the fault of the security vulnerability.

As a former whitehat security researcher, if this guy weren't famous he would be fired, for certain. I cannot think of how much more one could fail at their job and then to complain he has been personally attacked because of that title... That title is overly generous, pretentious shill would be what I would call this guy. Also BC has a history of security vulnerabilities laying in the wild for long periods of time such as persistent xss (proof is on bitcointalk) and should not be used for serious purposes.

As a former whitehat security researcher it is my opinion those points are both too generous in an effort to reach compromise. Lets be clear, this is not a one time deal situation of they lost the email and went on vacation, but clearly a systemic problem or series of problems with the bug reporting system being completely broken. To be blunt it is my opinion that any normal employee who was hired only as a security chief would be fired for this complete systematic failure, and if not, then ABSOLUTELY for the way he handled it.  
Blockchain also has a history of this.
