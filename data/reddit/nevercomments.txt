Exactly. The answer isn't increase the block size, which will increase the chance of centralization. The answer is lightning networks, which would be run by a single central authority on their centralized, off-network chain which performs on-chain transactions once daily. 
Core's answer is reinventing automated clearing houses.

I'm not even sure that "altcoin shill" is an insult.  I am extremely passionate about cryptocurrency and its potential impact on the future of finance globally.  Whether that comes in the form of Bitcoin, or any other, matters little to me.  
I'm not solely interested in my "investments" (Even using that term for Bitcoin makes me a little ill), I care about the bigger picture.

[Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](   
Hell, the introduction points out high transaction cost *specifically* as one of the problems Bitcoin aims to solve.

Bitcoin's purpose is to be a trustless peer-to-peer currency.  That goal is achieved through decentralized consensus. 
The purpose isn't to be decentralized, but being decentralized is necessary for it's goals.  
If Bitcoin is decentralized but useless as a currency, then it has failed regardless.
Edit: I was banned from for this comment.  I made my first post here almost 4 years ago in Jan 2014, and this will be my last.

My post was about how you can't seem to see the forest for the trees.  
If Bitcoin can't be used as a currency (Yes, even to "buy a fucking cup of coffee"), then being decentralized is a pointless detail.

BTC has spent 7 years debating over how to scale "properly" (While most proposals are actually compromises and off-chain scaling solutions in order to avoid the "proper" way that would result in a hard fork).
Meanwhile everyone else has been pushing this tech forward and actually scaling.  ETH processes more transactions daily than all other crypto (including BTC) combined.

I was definitely being sarcastic, sorry.  
"Centralization" was the biggest (and really, only) reason given by the Core dev team for not increasing block size, but their alternative solutions (Lightning Network/Sidechains)  are even more centralized and dangerous for the health of the network than any worst case scenario from bigger block storage/bandwidth.

[Bitcoin Core]( is the current standard implementation of Bitcoin.  Cash is another implementation.  Core is "the" Bitcoin because that's what the consensus is, but there's nothing inherent about Core or the Core devs that gives them any authority or privilege over anyone else.

Because it uses scrypt instead of SHA-256 for proof of work, which (right now) prevents SHA-256 ASIC farms from completely dominating the mining economy. 
Scrypt coins are still profitable to mine with consumer grade GPUs, while Bitcoin hasn't been for years.

Nothing in that article indicates that NoScript would have made a difference.
Java applets and Javascript are two entirely separate technologies.

Now you're just being belligerent *and* wrong.

Because not everyone shares your point of view.  
Some people actually believe that being publicly identifiable is a good thing, and don't wish to have *absolutely everything* they do online anonymized.

Both Firefox and Chrome already block Java applets from running on a stock install.  
A user with NoScript and a user without both visiting that site would have had to manually allow Java to run to try it out.

Blame the mods. All the people seriously discussing Bitcoin left back when the improvements to the block size were starting. The top mod, with stakes in companies invested in and promoting Bitcoin, declared that no discussion of any form would be permitted.
