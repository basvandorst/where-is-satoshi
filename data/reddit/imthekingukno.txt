"Six years later, in late 1997, the web was more or less similar to today's, though minus social networking and with significantly clunkier layout."

lmao i dont kno if ill ever get tired of reading bitcoin diehard's rants about litecoin
so fukin mad, its hilarious
and vorhees rant had me dying, truly comical how defensive and upset ppl get about an altcoin as if its killing bitcoin or something.
cant wait to see reactions when it is traded on gox/bitstamp/btcchina and coinbase &amp; bitpay supports it... ppl might start swallowing barrels LOL
hey, its not like bitcoin was fueled by massive speculation in its earlier days (and its not like that today either) LOL

lol this dood a classic example of a guy with blinders on and sees every other crypto as a threat to bitcoin. i highly doubt he even understands the concepts of the 1st mover advantage.
funny he calls it botnetcoin... botnets were around for btc for a LONG time before even asics saturation made them go mine other coins.
i love the simple mindedness.
