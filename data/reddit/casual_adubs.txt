The only problem with this is trading stops once there is a 5% increase or decrease. So they will probably have to stop 5 times a day. [Bitcoin Forks and The Bitcoin Futures Market - Andreas M. Antonopoulos](

The 2018 tax code going into effect is going to crush crypto trading.

Yes, you should. The IRS has the capability to make your life a living hell if not worse. As far as I understand. If you get paid in/mine bitcoin your taxed as soon as your in possession of it (hits you wallet) at the USD equivalent in worth. It is taxed as income. If you immediately sell it close to the same time it hits your wallet the only thing you pay is income tax. If you hold on to it for less than a year and it increases in value then your taxed on the increase ($100 in bitcoin ends up being $200 you cash out your taxed on the $100 increase. Short term capital gains if it was held for less than 12 months and long term capital gains if it was held for more than 12 months on the $100 gain.)
[Here]( is something that somewhat explains it.

Ah 7%. My apologies. Still. I think it would  halt their trading several times a day. I saw  [this video]( that made me feel a bit better about Monday.

You pay income taxes when you receive it and capital gains if you sell it and its worth more than it was when you received it. Short term capital gains tax if that coin was sold before 12 months and long term capital gains if its been more than 12 months. You only get taxed on the gain, not the entire thing. As far as my understanding goes currently.
