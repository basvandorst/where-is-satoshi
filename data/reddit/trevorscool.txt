Thank you so much for the generous tip! It's very much appreciated!
@_date: 2014-01-19 10:05:10
This looks very promising!
@_date: 2014-02-01 23:13:00
Yes, that is the next really interesting step. So what are the possible approaches/solutions to encode the nonce in the transaction itself? And how would the receiver be notified?

You're right, sorry, I've been rude.
My point is... in a couple of years, buying something with bitcoins will be far more common.
@_date: 2014-01-31 22:00:47
somebody wrote Andreas should suit up
@_date: 2014-02-02 10:31:53
Yes, you are correct.
@_date: 2014-01-31 21:39:16
Personally i'd be more interested in a price drop. Purchases are mostly for speculation at the moment and the price doesn't reflect the real use people make of bitcoins. People are paying high bitcoin price to have a little slice of the future bitcoin boom.
If we look at the stats though, 60k transactions/day really don't explain a 800$/btc price... and some miners are earning 25k $ to mine a block with just a few hundred transactions.
@_date: 2014-02-01 17:48:57
sure I did that.
@_date: 2014-02-02 10:30:26
* History is definitely a useful feature... i'll try to code it into the next release.
* I'll have to fix this
* There no obvious way for you to confirm me receiving the payment apart from keeping an eye on the blockchain for movement. It could be interesting to add the monitoring function to the app.
* Thanks for the suggestions!
@_date: 2014-01-19 09:06:34
In a couple of years nobody will post this anymore
@_date: 2014-01-19 10:52:00
Yes, nice for origami
@_date: 2014-02-01 23:08:19
Links, or payment requests. See [BIP70](
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:57:08
Boom, donated. Here's your nonce: 030cc7cacbf0fea05c5a5f01e765cedeab6bb79e7ddb1a7b0c93ae576c3c336df6
Did anybody see the payment? ;)

The price really isn't the point imho. Bitcoin has many advantages over credit cards but security is still probably the main concern for random users. I'm waiting for a good, easy-to-use multisig wallet before moving most of my coins out of cold storage and start spending them on a daily basis...
@_date: 2014-01-31 21:34:01
Actually with a credit card you can spend money you don't have while you must control some btcs in order to spend them, so visa could have it's place even in a btc world... maybe lending bitcoins
@_date: 2014-01-19 10:56:38
I think the key to success is more people getting to use bitcoin, 80% of btc are controlled by a handful of individuals. These funds need to move regularly to new owners in order for bitcoin to become a mainstream currency. Once this will happen, amazon will start accepting bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-19 09:22:23
Also true for third world countries. In Africa everybody has a cellphone, but how many own a credit card?
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:22:56
Yes, StealthBit is built upon that (see last line of the original post, I even linked to them).
However, I believe in simplicity for average users. That was the main motivation behind it.
If you have some advices to make it even simpler, I'd appreciate.
Another project I'd like to work on is a P2H multi-sig wallet. I have the feeling it's also too complicated for the average user.
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:26:02
As of now you'd have to transmit it manually either via email, bitmessage, chat, etc. But in the future it could be sent on the blockchain and clients could listen on it and notify you automatically of the received payment.
@_date: 2014-01-19 09:04:58
It's like feeding birds...
@_date: 2014-01-29 22:42:44
If all the Bitcoins currently in circulation were divided evenly between the world population, I would have 1.8 mBTC...
@_date: 2014-02-02 09:54:38
Thanks for the tip! It was fun.
@_date: 2014-01-19 10:41:46
or paid...
@_date: 2014-02-02 09:53:27
Ahaha, nice! Thanks man.
@_date: 2014-01-29 22:55:32
Forget about the price and just buy some. You'll get the chance to experience first hand one of the most innovative technology of the last decade.
@_date: 2014-01-19 10:10:46
To be completely anonymous i'd prefer a completely trustless system, but stealth addresses can be a good solutions if you don't need nsa proof untraceability and just want to unlink a couple of transactions...
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:26:39
So which name do you think would be suitable for such a utility?
@_date: 2013-05-12 13:24:04
Don't go with suicide. Show us the gambling transactions. After verification I will tip you some thousands of $.

Why? If people are not slaves, they can decide by themselves whether to do mining or not (if it is not attractive economically speaking, they won't do it). CaptchaCoin basically will work as long as 50% of the people who do mining are free, rather than slaves. And by slaves I mean people who are denied access to internet and kept forcefully somewhere to prevent them from learning about CaptchaCoin (otherwise they could mine for themselves).
@_date: 2013-04-17 08:04:04
Just tried to log in. Works fine. Thanks for the heart attack though :)
@_date: 2013-05-14 11:33:24
This would only work at the very beginning of the coin. As soon as the coin becomes widespread, they could mine by themselves (if this constitutes an attractive business). Why would they work for you? The only way you can force them, is by enslaving them.
@_date: 2013-04-18 11:42:56
I hate banks even more right now. Remember: first the money belongs to the government, then to the banks and then - if all these guys are happy - you may access your funds. This is not money. This is modern slavery.
@_date: 2013-05-14 09:23:29
By definition, captchas can't be solved by computers. If they are, they are not captchas anymore. I am suggesting using a very strong one.
@_date: 2013-05-14 11:49:07
I'm not sure I understand this completely. Especially, who is going to get the reward here?
