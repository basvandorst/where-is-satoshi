Or you know, just stop using the most energy consuming crypto...?

Ok that’s nice, so you need hydro-electric dams for a cryptocurrency to run ‘eco’ that is also already expensive?... It seems like every solution to bitcoins problems are just creating more problems ��

You realise what’s keeping Bitcoin as number 1 is stubbornness, minimal to no knowledge of cryptocurrency and being the most marketed cryptocurrency? 
Yes Bitcoin can adopt many functions and abilities that other crypto has, yet in over 10 years it’s still so far behind many other cryptos that are soaring past bitcoin at ‘lightning’ rates (lol). All bitcoin has to compete is the we were here first, be a sheep and follow us. 
And one more thing that I just don’t quite get, what is with you Bitcoin lovers and wanting bitcoin to rule them all? You’re saying you want all information in one place... with the way tech evolves these days, do you really think everything stored in one place is a good idea in the slightest? No. You want many chains to succeed. You want competition, you want the ability to have options, not just the one and only option.

Fast? No.
Cheap? No.
Easy to use for the masses? No.
Plenty to show after ten years of development? No.
The main reason for it’s majority in the crypto-sphere is that “BiTcOiN wAs HeRe FiRsT”? Yes.
Stubbornness is Bitcoins best friend. 
Prove me wrong? :)

I still don’t get why the BTC fanboys keep calling coins ‘shitcoins’
It’s gotta be some ego thing right?
