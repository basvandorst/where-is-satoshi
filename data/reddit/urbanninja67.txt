A few weeks. Coinbase's support is rather slow. This was before I knew that's what I had to do though. So giving them all the information right off the bat should speed things up.
But once I got my new account set up and my identity verified, only a few more replies from them confirming the email for the new account and it was done.

Wow, it only got to 213 on Coinbase. That's crazy.

Did it really go that far? I saw it was going down, but I only saw it hit 213 and it started going back up.

I just had this problem. Open a support ticket explaining it to them. They had me make a new account with a different email and verify my identity with it. After that I gave them my new account email and they transferred all my coins to the new account.

That's right, don't let them take your job!

Well, guess I'm changing banks.
The thing is though, is I've recently bought some without a problem

I got 10 of them when it was down at 230. :) so I've been on the train for a while.

Before I read  this, it was at 420. after I read this, it was at 380. Sold 5 at about 400 today. Bought 10 of them at 230. I think it worked out well for me.
