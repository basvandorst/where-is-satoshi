Bullshit, your timeline is completely off. Either you weren't around or you didn't have much skin in the game because the top was near thanksgiving and the bottom around $200 was almost a year later. I remember watching for weeks thinking that the dip would be bought and that each dead cat bounce signified the end of the bear trap. 
When the bubble actually pops, it won't resolve itself in a matter of days. It will grind downward for months.

"Investing" in BTCjam seems pretty sketchy to me. Investing in companies through havlockinvestments, btct.co or bitfunder seems safer and will lead to a better return IMO. In any case, investing btc is not "safe" as you could lose some or all of what you gain. Investing should entail a lot of research into exactly who you're giving the money to and what they actually do.

Unless you were one of the daytraders who lost half of their coins in the crash. Up 49% this month made me quite happy to have sat on mine.

Well said. My brief stint in daytrading lead to little to no profit. Trading stocks and collecting dividends has definitely lead to a greater, more stable return.

If you invest bitcoins in securities, you risk losing those bitcoins, and you expect some interest or return on that investment in bitcoins. The goal of investing in securities is to end up with more bitcoins than you would have if you had just kept them in a wallet.

Bitcoin is a shift in economic power from those who sought it ruthlessly to those who actually want change the world for the better. If you're only in bitcoin for speculation, I'd challenge you to think about what sort of work you would do knowing that your needs were 100% covered. My perception is that tech people *tend* to be brilliant and kind-hearted, and we need that kind of power in the world.

It's too easily misunderstood or mistyped

Can you explain why bitcoin is immune to abuse by corrupt politicians and greedy corporations who at that point would be fully invested in and control a large amount of the currency?

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE talk to you server before you give them a bitcoin tip. If I knew nothing about bitcoins, I would be just as pissed to get this as I would to get a "tip" of my salvation in the form of a pamphlet from a church group. Servers don't tend to have much disposable income, and most rent isn't paid in bitcoins.

You're investing bitcoins to get more bitcoins, the USD exchange rate has nothing to do with it. You would have benefitted from the bitcoin appreciation if you had just hoarded your coins in a wallet and you would have been exposed to a lot less risk. It makes no sense to value your bitcoin securities in USD since most of the time, USD to BTC conversion rate has nothing to do with them.

Are you really surprised that a paid model wasn't there for her technical knowledge?

With only a 3% fee, I would think the profit margins would be very narrow. Unless you plan on having the USD available on MT.Gox and executing a trade in that instant that the user inserts their cash for bitcoins, you can't expect to front them the bitcoins and buy them on the exchange later for any amount of profit with the way that the coins have been rising lately. If the former is your plan, you're going to have to deal with the excessive lag and difficulty quoting an accurate price.
