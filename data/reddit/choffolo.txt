What if they make bitcoin illegal? 
Will you still be into it?
I totally understand what you went through and how it impacted your life, but I believe that it's not through the benevolence of the state that we are going to see any good, especially in the long term.

Well done, and you don't need a blockchain for that as already proved many times. 
Thanks for fighting the shills IBM&amp;co. is trying to sell to the market.

Pretty much a fiat anyway

Bravo Giacomo. Ottimo lavoro.

War effort. 
Funding a war is dead expensive and you can't do it on a gold standard.
Once gold is over, the war is lost.
It's different instead with FIAT money, as you can push your war up until a whole country economy is completely destroyed.

They used to say this around cryptography as well.
Cryptography was considered a weapon until 1994.

I wonder if anyone can clear out to me if the standard packet size of the TCP/IP protocol has ever been changed?
Or is it the infrastructure around it that shaped around the protocol?

I feel weird, this was the first speech of Andreas I didn't fully enjoy.
It must have been the huge PwC logo behind him and him talking about blockchain technology in the same way that PwC would then write into its fancy PowerPoints?
Please remember... There are no God or Jesus in bitcoin.
But anyway, I really like Andreas and the immense job he has done for bitcoin, so if this speech pays him well to keep on with its studies and evangelization... All good.

You put in your wallet (paper, hardware, whatever), pay, they send bitcoin.
With SEPA, It obviously take two days.
If you pay with faster methods, it almost gets instantaneous and cryptos are sent out immediately.

Bear in mind that fiat money average life is 27 years.
On the 9 year lifetime that bitcoin has, it proved an incredible ability to store value, even with huge fluctuations, as humanity is still trying to grasp its real value and meaning within the (now digital) world.
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:25:26
Yes, I do understand that. 
However, it's a workaround due to the fact that we don't have sound money anymore and a costant attempt to store value, while our system is based on destroying the value of our work and production.

Whose heads at that point will be rolling down the street.

Cool, it's basically a trap.
If you get into bitcoin and make a gain, you are literally locked into bitcoin as going back to fiat would be extremely disastrous to your gains.
Another point in favour of bitcoin. Another failure for the current financial system.
