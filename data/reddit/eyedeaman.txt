Yeah I'm not sure how instantaneous BitPay converts to fiat. I will have to look into that. 
But thank you for those cons, I appreciate it!

As someone who bought his first Bitcoins at $140 today, I got a bit worried. Trying to keep a level head about it though and I believe it will bounce back.

That second image is telling me it's a jpeg, but I clearly see it moving. Either I'm insane or you're a wizard.

It may have been posted before but here is the Operator of BTC Guild saying he will kill part of the pool if it gets too close

That's what I was thinking, but it's not synching up. It's been synching the same block for hours now.

I recommend you post here if you haven't yet to be added to their support queue. It seems they check that often. 
I just (reluctantly) used BitInstant and the transaction went through flawlessly, so it's not completely broken. They are ridiculously bogged down which isn't surprising and I'm sure they're freaking out these last few weeks. They're support is lackluster at best but they ARE trying, you just need to know where to contact them. 
Lastly, I'm sorry you've gotten screwed here but the last thing I want to see is the whole subreddit filled with these types of posts. I've seen about 10 of this exact post today and it's just blocking out other good content. Maybe there needs to be better moderation. Maybe there needs to be one central BitInstant post where their customer support can look. IDK.

The thing that worries me is, like you said, people aren't buying a whole lot with Bitcoins. It seems people are buying up right now because it's the hot thing but no one knows what to do with them. Once people lose interest will the price go crashing back down?

Where would you recommend trading alt-cryptocurrencies? I recently just bought some LTC through btc-e but I want to look into PPCoings as well. Thanks for any help. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:21:37
I don't even have any to give away currently but I definitely see what you're saying. I will have to be careful but I'm new to this and it wouldn't hurt to have some friends to figure things out with.

At this point the only way to stop this from happening is to ban or limit the number of posts regarding the price. 
Probably would be better to have one thread per day to discuss the price of btc.

People say BTC is gold and LTC is silver, meaning they are somewhat complimentary and can coexist. I can see LTC finding a niche because there are much lower wait times for transactions which would help for things like paying for a meal or something. 
It's almost certain that the price of LTC will see a huge spike when Gox picks it up. I was on BTC-e when they added PPC and the price at the time was ~.002 PPC/BTC on other exchanges, but when BTC-e opened trading the price rocketed up to almost .04 PPC/BTC before come crashing down. If something similar happens to LTC when it is added to Gox, it could have a huge payout. 
EDIT: A side note on alt-coins. I read that all the main alt-coins (LTC, PPC, NMC, TOR, etc.) with the exception of PPC are based on the code for BTC. This means that if an exploit was found on BTC, all other alt-coins would be affected besides PPC. This could give PPC some long term value as a type of fail safe to BTC. This could completely be wrong, though, because I just read it somewhere briefly.

K so I'm a noob here. Can you elaborate on how to do the -rescan commandline option please? 
Still not noob enough to fall for that joke ;)

Hi, as someone who is young and interested in HFT (not necessarily for Bitcoins), what do you recommend to get started learning? Books, languages, concepts, etc. Thanks for any help anyone can provide! 
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:56:55
I think the solution is simply stricter moderation. I fear that splitting up into different subreddits will dilute the activity in each sub too much. With the growth that this sub is seeing it's bound to have an influx of useless posts but I've seen it combated well with clear and firm rules.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:42:28
I don't know about infinitely, but yes.

I should also manage that I was able to import the bitcoin-qt wallet to a blockchain.info wallet, and it also showed a balance of 0 BTC. I had to enter my password to import the wallet, so I am fairly confident that it is the same wallet that has my BTC's. I'm hoping it just has to do with bitcoin-qt not syncing up correctly.

I can't help but have a good chuckle, then I realize I'm losing real money because of this and I still can't help but chuckle.

I've heard their support response times are getting a little long. I'm sure they're experiencing unprecedented amount of traffic with what's bee happening. Plus they're located in Russia so who knows what goes on there. I would just relax and give it some time for a response.

My general rule of thumb of thumb on the internet is to never click on anything using a URL shortener.

This is seriously awesome. I've been trying to explain Bitcoins to my friends but they aren't the brightest bunch. If it's tied into Facebook they will automatically think it's cool. Thanks!
