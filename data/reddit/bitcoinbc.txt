I just transferred some bitcoins to a friends account on a website,
I did a test transaction as I heard there was some problems sending payments to the website, it went through instantly like it always does. I then did a larger transfer which has been pending for over 3 hours, I also did a few test transactions after to see, and neither of them came through also.
Here are the tx, the first being the most important
Also looking at the receiving wallet it appears the bitcoins are there?
What's the best course of action? I have heard about this double spend method, how would I do that?
Could I somehow export the wallet from the website and be able to recover the funds?
Any help would be much appreciated
