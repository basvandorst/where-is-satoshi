I think batching your transactions would be better. For example, every time I make a purchase on an exchange, I don't immediately send it to my HW wallet. I wait until I've made a few purchases, then send it all to my HW wallet in one transaction. That way there is (hopefully) only one larger UTXO, instead of many smaller ones. Then when I send bitcoin, only that one UTXO is needed, as long the amount I'm sending is less than what is in that UTXO. Disclaimer: This is based on my current understanding, I'm still learning about all this. Also, doing this has security implications, since the exchange (or my account there) could get compromised while I'm storing BTC there.

Even if you get a raise, that doesn't do anything to protect your savings. This destruction of the buying power of a currency discourages savings, encourages spending and debt, and forces savers to place their wealth in riskier assets. But it allows politicians to spend more money without directly stealing from, er I mean, taxing the people.

How do you come up with 40 years?
4TX per second x 60 sec per min x 60 min per hour x 24 hour per day x 365 day per year = 126144000 TX per year.
325,000,000 (current US population) / 126144000 = 2.576420599 years

There at least two reasons that more people owning bitcoin will have an upward pressure on the price.
First is the law of supply and demand. More people owning bitcoin implies more demand. More demand pushes prices up. In most markets, the supply will then increase to meet the demand, stabilizing the price. Since there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, supply cannot rise to meet the demand, so the price rises instead.
The other reason is the network effect. The more nodes in a network, the more valuable the network. In this sense, Bitcoin is analogous to the internet. How valuable would the Internet be to you if only 10 other people had access to it? Compare that to the value of the Internet when the whole world connects to it.

If you've already got another emergency savings account, and you're caught up on your bills, and you have a decent understanding of how bitcoin works, why it is highly valued, what its long term potential is, and how volatile it is, then I would recommend using a dollar cost averaging strategy to invest your money into bitcoin.
Disclaimer: Dollar Cost Averaging is what I do (except for FOMO buys on big dips). But if I had just gone all-in when I first learned about Bitcoin, I'd be a gigamegionaire today.

Or, be smart, and avoid the taxes legally. It takes preparation, and may not be a fit for everyone, but it's not too hard to do.
For example, you can put bitcoin into a Roth IRA and never pay capital gains tax on the gains.
Another example: if your total income (capital gains, wages, tips, etc) is under a certain amount, you pay no long term capital gains. For married filing jointly, that amount is  currently $78,750.

If I understand correctly, if there is more value flowing into Bitcoin from fiat, it would cause the price of Bitcoin to rise, which would make mining more profitable, creating an incentive to direct more hashing power to mining, which adds security to the Bitcoin network.

No, I'm not arguing that human life has not value, that's not even relevant to the discussion. But you are arguing here that the insulin shot and food have value because humans value it, not because it has some "intrinsic" value. You are making one of my points: things only have value because we place value in them. My other point is that value is subjective, because different people put different value on the same thing. For another example, I place a high value on my guitar, because I get a lot of enjoyment from playing it. Someone who has no interest in playing it will most likely place a lesser value on it. Therefor, the value is subjective.
I'm not sure why you say that "if value was entirely subjective then fiat money, keynesian economics, socialism and communism would have been successful." I didn't realize that the only thing required for any of them to work was that value be subjective. Nor do I see any evidence that "Value cannot be entirely subjective there has to to be an objective component to it."

@_date: 2018-09-17 00:56:39
I think I have a different definition of objective and subjective than you. For me, if something is objective, it is something that is not influenced by personal feelings or opinions in considering and representing facts. For instance, 2+2=4 is an objective statement. However, "This guitar sounds better than that guitar" is purely subjective depending on one's taste, in the same way that the statement "Vanilla ice cream tastes better than chocolate ice cream" is subjective. Likewise, the value of Bitcoin is very subjective. I believe it is a better money than fiat, and am willing to trade my fiat for it. Most people disagree with me, and will not do so. I think over time, more people will come around to agree with my subjective opinion. If the value of Bitcoin was objective, everybody would already agree on exactly what it's worth, just as we agree that 2+2=4.
Back to your explanation about my experience buying a guitar, you focused solely on my experience choosing it, my enjoyment paying it, and my budget. These things are all based on my experience, choices I've made, maybe even some hereditary constraints or advantages passed down to me. None of these are objective truths that hold for everyone. Heck, they don't even hold for me, as over time my preferences change. This is in complete contrast to something that is truly objective. 
This view of the subjectivity of value is not something that I came up with, it was something I've learned after a casual investigation of Austrian economics.  Prior to that, I thought of value as being objective also, although to be honest, I hadn't really given it much thought until then.

I was referring to the car, which you somehow parked under a big truck :) But to your point, the van pic doesn't show a Bitcoin sticker (at least, not at a casual glance), and the amount you own is irrelevant because any potential attacker wouldn't know how much you have, just that you have some that they might be able to take from you with a $5 wrench.
@_date: 2018-09-24 06:58:31
Keep in mind that Bitcoin is pseudonymous, not yet truly anonymous. Even though your name is not associated with your address, there are ways to tie them together. For instance, if you purchase Bitcoin on an exchange, and then transfer from there to a wallet address, the exchange now has a record that ties you to that address. Or, when your wallet queries for certain addresses, those addresses can then be associated with your IP address, which can then be associated with you.
There are ways to make it more difficult, such as using decentralized exchanges like [bisq.network]( to purchase bitcoin, and using a VPN or the TOR network to hide your IP address. There are also other coins that focus on privacy, like Monero.

I agree. To some extent, the Bakkt news is already baked into the price, as far as entities that are already in the market are concerned. But if Bakkt is successful, they will bring new buyers into the market, which means an increase in demand. Since the supply rate of Bitcoin is very inelastic, an increase in demand should lead to an increase in price.
But I'm worried about Wall Street shenanigans. We don't need them involved for Bitcoin to fulfill its promise of becoming a decentralized, border-less, censorship resistant, sound money. Wall Street may provide a short-cut to a sharp increase in price, but to me, it feels like it might be a deal with the devil, and we might give up a lot more than we realize. These Wall Street suits have been playing this game for a long time, and they have become exceedingly good at it.

Here is what I would do if I was in your situation: Express your interest to your friends, and see if one of them is willing to sell you some, and help you get a wallet set up.
Avoid the centralized exchanges and all the KYC/AML BS. Once you have some bitcoin from your friends to use as a security deposit, use a decentralized exchange, I recommend Bisq, to keep purchasing in a Dollar Cost Averaging manner. Bisq is truly peer-to-peer and non-custodial, and you never give them any information about yourself, you don't even set up an account with them. There is a little bit of a learning curve, trades take longer, and currently the volume is low. But if you're not planning on day trading, the advantages of decentralization far outweigh the drawbacks.
Edit: Forgot to say: Don't take advice from idiots like me on Reddit :)

[bisq.network]( it's the most decentralized, peer-to-peer, non KYC/AML exchange available. HodlHodl is another great choice. They made some different design decisions than Bisq did, and it's not truly decentralized, but has some other benefits, and still a great choice.

I honestly don't think there is way to predict it accurately. Value is subjective. Bitcoin, just like any currency or store of value, only has the value that people place in it. I believe over time more people will come to place more value in Bitcoin, and since it is strictly scarce, the value of each satoshi should rise. By how much??? I honestly don't know. Maybe more people will come to value it as a store of value, and if so it could take some of the market share away from other stores of value like gold. As fiat currencies continue to be destroyed by their issuers,more people might begin to value as a hedge against inflation. I'm sure there other ways that people might find value in Bitcoin, but right now my wife has dinner on the table, and I place a higher value on that than I do on continuing this post :)
Edit: I think I misunderstood your question. You were not asking about expected return on investment, you were asking how much bitcoin will be returned to MtGox victims. I think it's about 170,000 bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-09-16 04:39:05
All value is subjective; It is wishy washy.
For instance, someone with diabetes would place a much higher value on a dose of insulin than someone that doesn't have diabetes. Or if I'm starving to death, I might very well value a slice of bread higher than all my earthly possessions. But if I've just feasted on four course meal, I might not see any value at all in a whole loaf of bread.
The idea of "intrinsic value" is kind of silly. Nothing has value in and of itself, it only has the value that is placed on it by sentient beings. Consider if there were no sentient beings at all, what value would food have?

I considered doing the same thing. However, I think a Roth IRA would be better. If Bitcoin moons, you might end up in a situation where you have way more money in your HSA than you will ever need for healthcare. But if you withdraw to spend it on something unrelated to healthcare,  you'll have to pay taxes on it. With a Roth IRA, you never pay taxes when you withdraw (edit: as long is you're over 59 1/2 years old, I think it is).
But, having to much money in an HSA sounds like a pretty damn good problem to have :)

Fiat transactions are verifiable, although reversing transactions is a problem that has happened. But Bisq minimizes the incentive for that action, and only supports payment methods that are difficult to reverse, or even impossible, like USPS money orders. And Bisq is liquid enough for lots of people like myself, who simply use a DCA buy and hold strategy. I've been using it for about a month now, and am very happy with it.

One caveat about using Bisq that's rarely discussed: it's addictive. I've been buying and hodling BTC for a couple of years using centralized exchanges, but there's something about trading on Bisq that I find exhilarating.

Bisq supports a variety of payment methods, like Zelle, bank transfers, even USPS money orders. As long as you can use one of the supported payment methods, you can either accept an existing offer that uses that payment method, or make your own offer.

It's the only such exchange that I know of that is also a fiat on-ramp. The drawbacks are that it takes a little more effort to understand, it's not good for day trading because trades take some time, and there's not a lot of volume (yet).

If I remember correctly, there is a "Withdraw" button in the top left, above the buy and sell buttons. Then a popup should give you some options, one of which is to withdraw BTC, and you can enter the address from your Exodus wallet there, as well as the amount to withdraw.
It's good to test the process with a small amount. Make sure you verify the address is correct. Make sure your sending BTC to a BTC address, not to a BCH address, etc.
Once you have a little bit more BTC, I would recommend trying out Bisq, a truly decentralized exchange.

I don't believe it does. However, you can trade alt-coins for BTC. Think of Bisq as a truly decentralized, peer-to-peer, non-custodial, BTC trading platform, with many out-of-band payment methods using fiat currencies or alt-coins. One side of every trade in Bisq is BTC, the other side could be fiat or alt-coin.
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:28:11
I don't think fees on Bisq aren't ridiculous, generally less than .5%, including mining fees. Also, you can set your offer a distance from the market to make up for the fees. It might take longer for someone to accept the trade, but it's worked out well for me so far. It all depends on the trade-offs you're willing to make. For me, the anonymity and non-custodial nature of Bisq is well worth the fees and low volume.
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:35:05
It's not preventing my bank account balance from extinction though :) But I've found a simple way to participate even when I've already used all the fiat I've allocated to buy bitcoin. I put in a small offer that's far enough away from market price that it's unlikely to be taken, but if it is, I'm OK with going over my allocation because it's such a good deal. Then when fiat is thrown my way again, I can adjust the distance to something more reasonable and start buying again.

If hashrate drops, then it will take longer for each block to be mined (until the next difficulty adjustment). Also, as often is the case, if there are more transactions in the mempool than can fit in one block, some of those transactions won't get placed in the next block. So your statement theoretically holds true only if hashrate doesn't decrease and all the transactions in the mempool can fit into the next block. Furthermore, there isn't a timer set to 10 minutes; rather, all the miners are trying to find the nonce, and when it's found the next bock is mined. So even if the hashpower is steady and the mempool is almost empty, it could, and often does, take longer than 10 minutes to mine a block. Disclaimer: This is all my current understanding, and may not be accurate, I'm no expert.

I honestly don't understand how or why anyone could be, or want to be, a gender different from what their body is. It makes no sense to me. But an inability to understand other people's needs and desires does not grant some moral standing to interfere with their choices. You're living your life in the way that you deem best for you. You own yourself, and you own your body. I'm glad bitcoin provided a path to freedom for you. Thank you for telling this story.

If people decide to use Bitcoin instead of banks and government, it will replace banks and governments. Whoever has Bitcoin and wants to loan it out at competitive rates will provide loans. Whoever provides protection services and charges a competitive price will provide protection services. I believe something can be pure, and still be subject to price manipulation. But, what do you mean by pure in relation to Bitcoin? Are you implying that Bitcoin has impurities? If so, what are these impurities? In what way does the purity of something affect it's resistance to price manipulation? What is your definition of "pure" Bitcoin? Your post leads to me to question your understanding of what Bitcoin actually is, but what I can say for sure is that your understanding of it varies greatly from mine.

Bitcoin is not just a currency, it's also a protocol to reach consensus. Currently, that consensus focuses on transfer of value, and at the core layer, I think it should stay focused on that. But layers could be added on top to reach consensus for a wide array of things, replacing many functions of government.

I was going through the same thing through the bear market, especially when the price went below 6K. I now try to stick to smaller regular investments, but when it dips bigly, I can't resist.
One thing I've done is to not run Bisq all the time. I just can't resist the "off the books" nature of the orders there.
@_date: 2019-03-04 02:19:01
No, you don't. If you want to convert, you can use Bisq to convert between BTC and fiat face-to-face with cash, or via the mail with USPS money order. No registration with any third party needed.
But that's besides the point, The point is that all these registrations and procedures that are such a pain in the ass have nothing to do with Bitcoin, they are requirements that governments and banks have in place.
@_date: 2019-03-15 02:47:40
Bisq is what you need to use. It's the most decentralized, peer-to-peer, exchange that does not require any ID. Methods of payment include face-to-face cash and money order. (No PayPal though, because it's too easy to reverse payments.) However, you need some bitcoin as a security deposit to get started using Bisq.
For that, try [Paxful.com]( they have all kinds of payment methods, including gift cards with which you don't have to reveal your identity. The prices are higher there than the market rate, so I recommend to just get enough to cover the security deposit for Bisq and then start buying there.

In the US, there are regulations that prevent a lot of financial/investment companies from self-custodying their clients investments. They have to use the services of a licensed custodial provider. Up till now, bitcoin custodial providers (CoinBase, Bitgo, etc) do not have a long history of provided trusted custodial services, so may traditional firms would not trust them. Now with Fidelity (and maybe soon Bakkt, a subsidary of ICE) providing Bitcoin custodial services, there is a bitcoin custodial service run by a trusted company with a long history. So if there really is a "herd of institutional money" coming into the Bitcoin, they now have a place that they can safely custody their bitcoins, which might mean they will finally start buying, which could drive the price up.
Of course, this would also mean that wall street has their hands on more bitcoin, so I expect their fuckery (fractional reserve, re-hypothecation, and who knows what else) to begin in earnest.

@_date: 2019-03-09 21:00:06
The cheapest is generally not the best. For example, you could simply use limit orders on Coinbase Pro, and pay no fees at all. But then Coinbase, and whoever they share or sell your data to, and whoever hacks any of them, all know exactly how much Bitcoin you've purchased, where you live, what you look like, etc.
Consider paying a very small and reasonable fee, using [bisq.network]( It's the most decentralized, peer-to-peer, non-custodial, non-KYC/AML exchange, with many fiat payment methods.

While I am also suspicious of wall street fuckery, there are regulations that force some institutions to use licensed/registered custodians to hold their securities. There are already some entities that provide these services, such as Coinbase and Bitgo. But these are relatively new entities, and not trusted by legacy financial institutions. That's what different about Fidelity, as well as Bakkt (due to its relationship with ICE).
We'll soon find out how much demand there is for these services, and how fuckey Wall Street will get with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-29 20:11:19
ICO's have nothing to do with bitcoin, other than scammers might use them as a tool to take bitcoin from less-than-savvy people. And centralized exchanges require that you trust them to use them, but again, centralized exchanges are not bitcoin. Blaming/losing trust in bitcoin because exchanges get hacked or scammed is like blaming the dollar when a bank gets robbed.
You can use and trade bitcoin on exchanges that do not require you to trust them. These are non-custodial exchanges, like Bisq or HodlHodl.

Great interview. In regards to the "Oh no, not another token" reaction that any true bitcoiner would have, the biggest takeaway is that BSQ tokens actually ARE bitcoins, they are just "colored" coins. If I understand correctly, this means that they follow all bitcoin consensus rules, and in addition, they follow some extra rules that make them BSQ tokens.

You can sell your bitcoin on Bisq, with a variety of fiat payment methods (face-to-face cash, postal money order, Zelle, bank transfer, bank cash deposit). The great thing is that Bisq does not require you to create an account, there is no KYC/AML. It's peer-to-peer, non-custodial, on-chain transactions. However, I don't think there is very much volume in Canadian dollars.
@_date: 2019-03-14 23:09:39
Interesting. Maybe they want to change their future contracts to settle in bitcoin instead of cash, so they can get their hands on actual bitcoin to play wall street games with it? (I have no idea if this is even feasible for them, just putting on my tinfoil hat and shooting from the hip.)

The Abra wallet is one quick/easy way, although I think the for credit/debit cards might be high. You might be able to do a bank trasfer to Abra, then buy bitcoin, with no fee.
Another option is to use Bisq. One of the supported payment methods is US Postal Money Order, which you can purchase with a debit card.

Great call on checking out Bisq. I think it's the best way to accumulate. I've made quite a few trades with Zelle. Keep in mind Bisq is peer-to-peer and on-chain, so you have to wait for the other party to do their part, and for blockchain confirmations. Not so great if you trying to day trade, although they are working on reducing the time it takes for trades to complete.
@_date: 2019-03-08 20:43:53
Welcome! If I could start over, the main thing I would do differently is avoid all regulated, KYC/AML exchanges. This makes getting bitcoin a bit harder, but then much fewer entities know what you have (marketers, government agencies, hackers, etc). Check out [bisq.network]( it's the most decentralized, peer-to-peer, open source exchange with fiat payment methods and no registration, KYC/AML, etc.
Also, I would have never messed with altcoins.

Well, not many transactions. It could be lack of buyers, or lack of sellers, or both. Looking at CoinMarketCap reveals a complete lack of BTC/CAD transactions for the last 24 hours:

Think of it like a pizza. You can split it up into 4 pieces, 8, 12, 16, or more if you want. But that little 1/16 piece of a pizza isn't going to be worth as much to you as  1/8 or 1/4. Or think of it like gold bullion. You can have 1/4 troy oz, or 1/2 troy oz, but they aren't worth the same as a 1 troy oz bar. Just because they are divisible to some degree doesn't change the value of the underlying element.

Why Invest in Bitcoin? Why Now? Excellent podcast episode, but focusing on Bitcoin only as an investment: [ Quick summary:
Reasons to buy:
* Bitcoin is uncorrelated to traditional investments, thus can reduce the risk of a portfolio.
* Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation and economic disasters.
* Bitcoin has outsized potential gains compared to traditional investments.
Reasons to buy now:
* Bitcoin is at a sweet spot in adoption, towards the end of risky early adoption, but before mass adoption.
* Bitcoin is "on sale" right now.
* It finally seems that institutional money is coming in, with the Yale endowment, Bakkt, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Chase, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity, and TD Ameritrade all getting involved, and with the low liquidity compared to the amount of money these institutions can bring, the upward pressure on price could be strong.

Printing money and borrowing it are both far worse than simply taxing (taking by force). Printing obfuscates the source of price inflation, and borrowing burdens future generations with debt without their consent. At least with theft, I mean extortion, er, I mean taxation, there is no doubt about who is doing the taking.
Edit: At least with Bitcoin, we have a way to hedge against the inflationary monetary policy of the Fed. I'm not sure how well Bitcoin works as a protection against government borrowing and taxation.

There are many supported payment methods, such as money order, Zelle, bank deposit or transfer, alt-coin, or face-to-face cash. The payment method is specified by the trader that creates the offer. The buyer has to deposit some bitcoin, then send payment according the offer, and then seller sends the bitcoin. Bisq guides the traders through each of these steps, managing the on-chain transactions, and abstracting the process behind buttons labelled as "Create new offer", "Take offer", etc.
@_date: 2019-11-06 13:53:31
With Bisq, you never deposit your fiat, you simply send it to, or receive it from, your trading partner. Bisq never has custody of your fiat or bitcoin. To keep both parties honest, security deposits are made to a multi-sig address, and there is a dispute resolution process to handle any problems.

They might be able to. If Coinbase gives the IRS your info, and that info includes the public address that you withdrew to, they might be able to match that address to the merchant that owns it. They might be able to do this either via chain analysis, or if the merchant makes their address publicly available. I'm not really sure how practical it would to do this though.

Depending on how fast you want to put that 20K to work, you could end up taking all the sell offers on Bisq pretty quickly, as there's still not a lot of volume there.
But I think it would still be worth considering to use Bisq for at least some of your purchasing, to get your hands on some bitcoin that's free of the hooks that come with the centralized exchanges.
@_date: 2019-11-06 13:48:37
If you find an offer on Bisq that you find acceptable, you simply click the "Take offer" button. Then Bisq walks you through the purchase process: sending Bitcoin security deposit to the multi-sig address, waiting for deposit transaction to confirm, send payment, then wait for seller to confirm receipt.
Alternatively, you can create your own offer to buy bitcoin, and wait for a seller to take your offer. The process is similar.
When you want to sell, you have similar options: accept an existing offer, or create your own. Similar to the buying process, Bisq walks you through each step, abstracting the technical processes behind simple buttons and instructions for you to follow.
Bisq never has custody of your bitcoin or fiat, so there is no concept of depositing or withdrawing with them.  There is only buying or selling with other Bisq users.

You could just use a payment method that is much harder to reverse, like Zelle or a USPS money order.
But a better option would be to use [bisq.network]( to buy and sell Bitcoin. Each participant has to make a security deposit that they lose if they try to cheat. It's the most decentralized, peer-to-peer, non KYC/AML exchange with support for many payment methods.
@_date: 2018-10-22 09:24:40
No, not most of the time, but it does happen. It's simply part of trading peer-to-peer, you have to wait on the actual person on the other side of the trade to respond.
@_date: 2019-03-18 04:45:45
If you're looking to completely avoid custodial exchanges, your best bet is Bisq. However, there's a chicken and egg problem: you need to deposit some bitcoin as a security deposit before you can buy.
I think Paxful would be a good way to get some bitcoin for that first Bisq deposit (.05 should be more than enough). You can get a gift card (for example, from Walmart) with cash. Then use that gift card to buy bitcoin on Paxful (although prices are high on Paxful), then use that bitcoin as a security deposit on Bisq (were prices are more reasonable). All of this can be done without KYC/AML.
Bisq is non-custodial, so there's no risk of the exchange losing or stealing your coins. But if you get more than a couple hundred dollars worth of bitcoin, you should consider using a hardware wallet like a Trezor to store your keys offine.

My suggestions:
1. Check out [pro.coinbase.com]( and learn how to use it. You'll use the same credentials that you do on coinbase, but save a lot on fees.
2. Don't bother with all the alt-coins.
3. Start purchasing Bitcoin with each paycheck.
4. Read "The Bitcoin Standard" ([
5. Get a hardware wallet (I recommend Trezor) and start storing your Bitcoin on it.
6. Research the benefits of decentralized exchanges, learn how to use one (I recommend Bisq), and if it meets your needs, start using it as soon as possible.
7. Read "Mastering Bitcoin" ([
8. Develop a long term outlook, don't worry too much about price swings.
From your post, it sounds like you might be interested in just trading. In that case, my suggestions won't help a lot. I think that the majority that try trading end up losing. If you do decide to buy/sell/trade, be sure to spend some time learning about trading, limits, stops, strategies, etc. Start small, win some, lose some, learn some, before going in big.

While there is always some risk of charge reversal with any sort of banking transaction, the risk with Zelle is really low. From Zelle's support page:


I've even seen some warnings to be careful sending money with Zelle because payments can't be reversed. But, if reversals do become a problem, then Bisq would likely remove it, like they did with Venmo and Cash App.

You can't withdraw Bitcoin from RH, you can only sell (and pay capital gains tax on any gains) and withdraw cash. So that in itself means you never actually have Bitcoin, because you don't have the keys. You simply have a promise that RH is holding the keys, and you hope that when you want to sell, they will sell at the market price and give you the cash. And as far as I know, they have never had a problem doing so.
But consider this... What if all your purchases of Bitcoin on RH are just numbers on a spreadsheet, and RH never actually buys Bitcoin? As long as the price of Bitcoin doesn't rise quickly, RH has no problems But if Bitcoin moons, and you (and everybody else on RH) wants to sell and withdraw, where will the money come from? Has RH ever been audited, or provided some kind of proof that they actually hold the Bitcoin? Or are they operating in a fractional reserve manner?
I would much rather use an exchange where I can take control of the keys, even if it costs more or is a bit more of a hassle. In fact, I use Bisq, which is just about the polar opposite of RH.

The deposit is held in 2 of 3 multi-sig contract. Bisq is not the holder/controller, as they can not control the deposit without the approval of at least one of the traders.
Decentralization is not all or nothing; there are different levels. Bisq is more decentralized than any other exchange that handles BTC and has a fiat on-ramp. But, for arguments sake, let's say that there is an exchange that meets your definition of decentralization. Then some other troll would come along and say:
*"I'm obviously superior to everybody here,  but I will stoop down to your level to help you understand the meanings of the terms you're ignorantly abusing. Since only humans use this exchange, it's not truly decentralized. Since all the computers that run the exchange depend on electricity, it's not truly decentralized. Since it only runs on one planet, it's not truly decentralized. And since the transfer is not done directly via telepathy from the seller's mind to the buyer's mind, it's not truly peer to peer."*
If there is a peer-to-peer decentralized exchange that meets your standards, please enlighten us poor, ignorant plebs. Until then, we'll continue enjoying the benefits that Bisq provides.

Not really true, exchanges can be decentralized and peer-to-peer. Decentralization is not an all-or-nothing term. There are levels of decentralization. Currently, I think Bisq is the most decentralized exchange. But, they only handle the bitcoin side of things. So the payment method might still be through a centralized 3rd party. But if you use Bisq with face-to-face or alt-coins as the payment method, I'd say that's very decentralized and peer-to-peer.
@_date: 2018-10-05 08:01:10
What issues did you see with Zelle today? I've used it quite often with Bisq, it has worked great for me. Other methods I've used that worked fine are postal money order and face to face. I also used Venmo and Cash App with no issues, before they were removed due to the ease of charge-back.
@_date: 2018-10-10 11:22:18
You're referring to using a bitcoin transaction accelerator. You can google that term and find some some services. But, I would just wait a while, and it should get confirmed. Approximately every 10 minutes, transactions get placed into a block, which means they are confirmed. You can use a block explorer, and either use your public address or the transaction ID to see confirmations, but your wallet will probably show how many confirmations also.

Bisq has plenty of payment options. Keep in mind that any fiat payment system that allows for easy reversal of transaction will not be allowed on Bisq. As for number of users and liquidity, it's still small, but improving. It's enough to satisfy my buy and hold needs, but I doubt it's enough to satisfy a very active trader, which is not Bisq's purpose.

If the seller lies, the buyer would put the trade into mediation, or if required, to arbitration. The dispute resolution process recently changed, and I haven't had any disputes since then, so I don't feel qualified to describe it in detail. But I did have a few disputes in the old process, which all turned out to be technical issues that the arbitrator was able to resolve.
The new dispute resolution system is a bit more complex, and I think will take longer, but is a big step forward in terms of decentralization.
The requirements for the security deposit can be set by the person creating the offer. Generally, they are reasonable, and I've never lost a deposit.

Square's Cash App would be a great way to get started. If you are not going to engage in high speed trading, then Bisq would be a great option. It is the most decentralized, truly peer-to-peer, non custodial, non-KYC/AML exchange. The trade-offs made to achieve these goals are that it's a little more difficult to use, trades take longer, and you have to put up a small security deposit to trade (to discourage fraud). Currently, the volume is low, but it is increasing. As far as I know, it's the exchange that comes closest to the Bitcoin community's decentralized peer-to-peer philosophy.

Bisq has a wallet. When you buy bitcoin on Bisq, the seler sends the bitcoin from his wallet to the buyer's wallet. Bisq never has custody. Likewise, Bisq never has custody of the currency that is used for payment, that is handled out-of-band, for instance, face-to-face, with an alt-coin transfer straight from the buyer's wallet to the seller's, or some kind fiat bank deposit transfer.

You can sell it on Bisq, and receive payment in a number of ways, including cash deposit into your bank account, bank transfer, Zelle (mobile app for instant transfers), money order via mail, face-to-face cash, or even other cryptocurrencies. The best thing is that Bisq is there is no central company or authority that you have sign up with, no big brother KYC or AML, and they never have custody of your bitcoin or your fiat.
The biggest drawbacks are that volume is low (but growing fast), trades take longer than centralized exchanges, and the interface, while perfectly functional, looks kind of clunky.
Give it a shot, it might be exactly what you need. It's the only exchange I use. [bisq.network](

Bisq is great for trading in a peer-to-peer manner. It's the most decentralized exchange that I know of, it never has custody of your funds, and has no KYC/AML requirements.
If you need your trades to be instant, I don't think think Bisq (or any decentralized peer-to-peer exchange) will work for you. Likewise, if you trade more than a couple of times a day, there are currently not enough users/volume on Bisq to handle that without moving the price. But if you trade once or twice a week, Bisq is great.
I find the the interface to be somewhat clunky, and takes a little getting used to. But it's completely functional.
There is a dedicated (but small) team behind Bisq, and they are continually improving it. And the volume is increasing.
The best thing to do is download it, and either find an offer that you like and accept it, or create an offer. You won't really know if it's a good fit for you until you've made a few trades. It's a great fit for me, it's now the only exchange I use.
@_date: 2018-10-05 08:06:26
Only methods where reversal of payments are very difficult are allowed in Bisq. Zelle is pretty much impossible to reverse, at least right now. They could change their policy to make it easier, but if that happens Bisq will probably drop them, like they did Cash App and Venmo.

I'm not a tax accountant... but (at least int the US) if you simply moved your BTC from your Coinbase "wallet" to another wallet you own, that shouldn't be taxable event, and it shouldn't affect the time or cost basis from your original purchase. If you hold on to the BTC for one year (from the time you purchased it) before selling/trading, then you should only have to pay capital gains taxes on your gains. If you sold/traded in less than a year, you'll have to pay regular income tax, which is most likely going to be higher. Keep in mind the following:
* If you're single (or married filing separate) and your total income (including all earned income/wages/tips, capital gains, etc) is less than $38,600, your capital gains tax rate is 0%.
* If you file as head of household and your total income is under $51,700,  your capital gains tax rate is 0%.
* If you're married filing jointly and your total income is under $77,200,  your capital gains tax rate is 0%.

What is the centralized service that it goes through? What is it called, and what is its IP address(es), and domain name(s)? Who is running it?
The Bisq software includes a wallet. When a trade is accepted, the offered bitcoin and security deposits get locked up in an on-chain, 2-of-3 multisig contract/escrow. When the buyer sends payment, he signs the contract. Once the seller receives payment, he signs the contract, and the bitcoin is released from the on-chain multisig escrow to the buyer's wallet. There is no central Bisq service that handles this. It is all on-chain, performed by the Bisq software running on the buyer and seller computers, and of course the Bitcoin network.
Regarding the national currency (or alt-coin, if that is the chosen payment method), Bisq does not handle that at all, it's handled completely out of band.
@_date: 2018-10-22 09:19:46
Institutional buyers are restrained by regulations from holding their investments in-house, and turn to custodial services from entities like State Street that provide these services. But there aren't many entities that provide custody solutions for Bitcoin that meet regulatory requirements. And there are none that are "trusted" firms with a long history.
Bakkt changes that, since they are owned by the InterContinental Exchange, which  does have a history. So now, these institutions that could not buy Bitcoin before, can now do so.
Bakkt might be the first custody solution from such a "trusted" entity, but there are others, like Fidelity, with a background in the traditional investment world that are working on custody solutions for Bitcoin.
Some of these institutions have hundreds of billions of dollars under management, so even just putting a fraction of of their assets into Bitcoin could move the market. Of course, I'm sure they are aware of this and will try to enter the market with as little price movement as possible.
But the bottom line is that if there truly is a "wall of Wall Street money" or a "herd of institutional investors" waiting to enter the Bitcoin market, properly regulated custody solutions should provide a way for them to enter it, which would mean a huge increase in demand.
I'm hopeful that the price will increase, but also wary of wall street fuckery. This isn't what Bitcoin was created for. In what way does Bakkt strengthen censorship resistance, or enhance the hardness of the monetary policy, or provide a safe haven from bank bailouts?

That trade wasn't on Bisq. You can only buy or sell Bitcoin on Bisq. That being said, you are correct, the terms of service do say that you should only use Zelle with people you know and trust. Doesn't seem to be a problem though, it's a very common payment method on Bisq.

Are you just trolling, or are you actually not getting it? Bisq is the wallet that's in use. You say that the multi-sig contract is the middle-man part, but that is on-chain, as in, on the Bitcoin blockchain. Bisq is just the software that handles it. It's just as peer-to-peer and direct as using any other wallet that supports multi-sig. Every other computer running Bisq, and every other Bisq user, and every other person associated with Bisq could suddenly disappear from the face of the earth, but as long as the buyer's and seller's computers are running Bisq, and can connect to Bitcoin nodes and each other over the Internet, the transaction will still happen. So, again, where is the centralized portion?
Your last statement, about sending money from your bank account to mine being peer-to-peer, is laughable. Think about it. What other institutions are involved in that transaction besides you and me? I'm thinking you don't understand what peer-to-peer is. Either that, or I don't.

Coinbase is a legitimate exchange where you can buy and sell bitcoin, but the fees are kind of high. To reduce these fees, use CoinbasePro. It just requires a little time to learn how it works, about maker/taker fees, etc, but fees are much lower and withdrawals are free.
Ultimately, though, truly decentralized, peer-to-peer, non-custodial, non KYC/AML exchanges like Bisq are best if you're not going to be day trading. They are generally a bit more difficult to use than centralized exchanges, but the lower risk and improved privacy are well worth it.
I recommend holding of on mining until you've done some research and have a better understanding.

Be very wary of using centralized exchanges. Eventually, they will get hacked. Or, your account will get hacked.

I recommend using Bisq, a completely decentralized, peer-to-peer, non-KYC/AML exchange. It's not perfect (mainly, low volume, and trades take some time because everything is done on-chain), and you have to have a little Bitcoin to get started (as a security deposit, to discourage fraud), but the privacy advantages far outweigh the cons.

The whole idea behind DCA is that you buy a set dollar amount on a regular recurring schedule regardless of price, which will cause you to *buy more when the price is low* than when it is high. If you suspend your DCA purchases when the price dips and resume when it goes back up, you end up buying more when the price is high.

Is Bitcoin deflationary, because the total supply is capped at 21 million, or inflationary because new coins are created every 10 minutes?
@_date: 2019-08-09 12:38:26
What you say is not wrong, but there is some nuance you may be missing. With the US dollar, $1 today is not necessarily the same portion of the total money supply as it will be next year, as the Fed could create more, thus reducing the value of that dollar. However, 1BTC will always be 1/21millionth of the total bitcoin supply. So 1BTC in the future will be the same portion of the total supply as it is today.

 I'm an anarcho-capitalist, or voluntarist, or consistent libertarian, or some other label. But I think of these as philosophies of non-aggression more than politics, as I don't don't participate in governmental politics, or governmental anything, any more than I have to. For me, Bitcoin promises a method of opting out of government monetary intervention, while at the same time offering possibility of weakening government in general. Sure, Bitcoin is ready for mainstream, but I don't think the mainstream is ready for Bitcoin. Bitcoin requires low time preference and personal responsibility, two things sorely lacking in society. I'm currently reading "The Bitcoin Standard" by Saifedean Ammous, and I highly recommend it. Also, Andreas M. Antonopoulosousolousloslololol's "The Internet of Money" is excellent.

I think I have a problem. I set a small goal for the amount of Bitcoin I want to own. Every time I reach the goal, I just end up setting a higher one. Just one more time, just a little more Bitcoin, I tell myself. Over and over. And these low prices are just exacerbating things, as I succumb to FOMO. I blame Saifedean Ammous and his book "The Bitcoin Standard" for this; without the solid understanding of the true promise of Bitcoin his book provides, I probably would have capitulated and bought a really nice guitar with my profit. The one thing saving me is the low liquidity on Bisq, which prevents me from just emptying by bank account :)

The Bisq decentralized exchange is probably your best bet. No credit card support, because the transactions are peer-to-peer. But you can use bank transfers, Zelle, money order, or even face-to-face payment methods.

That's the viewpoint of the Keynesian school of economics, yes. But, it's not some kind of a priori truth. There is also the Austrian school of economics, which contends that a hard currency is much better than an inflationary one. If I understand correctly, this is the school that heavily influenced Satoshi and many early adopters of Bitcoin.
That being said, it could be argued that Bitcoin isn't truly deflationary, since the supply gets inflated every 10 minutes. On the other hand, the total supply being capped at a known amount seems to be a pretty good argument that it is. Yes, I argue with myself, usually not publicly though.


For me, this is one of the most exciting things about Bitcoin, the possibility that it will weaken the stranglehold that government has on us all.
But, I'm no economist or political scientist, I'm just some random guy on the Internet who read a couple of books. I should probably read a few more.

Yep! But more to the point, they don't need or want to know your age, name, address, etc. Read up on Bisq, and check out their youtube page for more info, and a demonstration of a transaction. But basically, all Bisq does is facilitate the Bitcoin transfer, and provide informatrion to the buyer, who sends fiat payment to the seller via whatever payment method was selected by the seller. Bisq never has custody of your bitcoin or your fiat. It's a bit of a learning curve, but well worth the time to learn it.
@_date: 2018-06-26 11:52:16
I agree that Bisq is great, but saying that they are compliant with banks seems strange to me. All Bisq does is handle the transfer of Bitcoin and provide the buyer and seller enough info to transfer payment. Bisq has no need to be compliant with any bank. You don't send or withdraw any money to or from Bisq, they are completely non-custodial and never have control of anybody's bitcoin or fiat.
@_date: 2019-10-18 11:44:02
What you are asking for is a trusted centralized authority. One of the foundational principles of bitcoin is that we should be able to transact without such an authority. If you want reversible transactions, then use centralized systems, like the banking system. The reversible nature of these systems means that they are not censorship resistant, which is one of the most important features of Bitcoin.
I suppose there are or could be centralized institutions that provide custody for your bitcoin, and could reverse transactions made within their platform and/or between their partners. But in that case, you don't really have bitcoin, nor do you have the censorship resistant capabilities of it; the institution has your bitcoin, while you have an account number and a hope that should you want to take custody or spend your bitcoin, the institution actually has your bitcoin, and will do as you ask them to.

When you put up an offer on Bisq, you can set the "distance from market". If you set it to 0, your offer will automatically follow the market price from bitcoinaverage.com. Or, you can set a distance from market (in percentage) and it will do the same, except offset by the percentage you set. You can also just set a static price that does not change. The offer is editable after it placed, but not after someone has taken the offer.
I have seen offers up to 20% distance from market price (in both directions).

Sell it all at a loss now, and then buy back in at twice the price. It's what all the cool kids are doing these days.
Or, just continue to dollar cost average. It sounds from your post you may not be doing it right though. DCA requires you to buy the same dollar amount on each purchase, and that you purchase on a fixed, repeating schedule. This forces you to buy more when the price is low, and less when its high. If you bought more when  the price was high, and less when it was low, as your post suggests, that's not what I would call DCA.

Outside of us obsessed freaks, I think a lot of Bitcoin holders don't know about halving. Anecdotally,  I work in IT, and 3 of my co-workers, all very tech savvy and casual bitcoin holders, didn't know about it until I told them recently. And then there are all the pre-coiners who don't even own any bitcoin yet, probably don't even know about the 21 Million supply cap, and certainly don't know about the halving.
So... yes, some of us have pushed up the price in anticipation of the shock to supply. But there are a lot more who simply don't know about it, and to the extent that they start buying bitcoin over the next couple of years, the halving is not yet priced in.

Saving IS a use of money.
Also, the price of bitcoin is what incentivizes miners to secure the network. Price is the result of supply and demand. If more bitcoins are hodled, there is less for sale, which puts an upward pressure on price, which attracts more mining resources, which adds more security the network. So hodling is beneficiary to the bitcoin network.
Also, if one believes that the price of bitcoin is going to increase, he would be going against his self-interest to sell/trade/use it to buy things. If Bitcoin depends on people going against their own self-interest, it will very likely fail.

You could use Wasabi wallet to anonymize your bitcoins. However, Coinbase still knows that you bought bitcoin, and they could give that info to the government.

Bisq is great, but does have some drawbacks. For me, the benefits far outweigh the limitations.
* The most decentralized exchange exchange with fiat payment methods.
* No KYC/AML
* Low exchange fees (see below about mining fees)
* Uses TOR, can be completely anonymous, depending on payment method
* Many payment methods, including F2F, Money Order, Bank transfer/deposit, Zelle, altcoins, etc
* Only trading partner has access to your payment information (unless a dispute is opened)
* Trades can take a while, as everything is on chain
* There are 3 on-chain transactions for each completed order, so mining fees can be high
* Currently, low volume
* Interface is a little clunky, takes a bit effort to learn
* Purchasing bitcoin requires you to deposit some bitcoin as a security measure
* You have to leave the application running in order for your offers to be seen
Give it a shot! Sometimes you can snipe some really good offers.

One line of thought is that to pay off all that debt, lots of fiat money will be created (AKA "monetizing the debt"). This inflation of the fiat money supply would be a huge shock to "supply" side of the "supply and demand" equation of fiat, and would drive the value of fiat down. Since Bitcoin's inflation schedule is set, the value of bitcoin in relation to fiat would rise (if all other factors remain the same).

Price is important, in so much as it serves to provide information about how much demand there is for Bitcoin. If it is to become a legitimate monetary vehicle everywhere across the globe, that means that there would be great demand for it. And since the supply is strictly limited to 21 million, to meet this demand, the price must go up massively to meet it.
If the price remains low, that means there is not much demand for it, and it's not being used as a worldwide monetary vehicle.

Keeping your money in a bank account, earning whatever measly interest it generates, still reduces its buying power over time.
Bitcoin doesn't need any other financial instrument to cope with its volatility. It's a new creation, undergoing price discovery, and it's coping with this volatility just fine. It's still creating blocks every 10 minutes. It's still providing uncensorable, permission-less transfer of value. And it's still improving, becoming more resistant to attacks, and infecting minds with new ideas and possibilities.

The problem with Venmo is that it's not difficult to reverse charges, while it's impossible to reverse a bitcoin transaction.

If there is some new technology that enables harder, sounder, more censorship resistant, more inflation resistant, more decentralized money than Bitcoin, then I think it would be incorporated into Bitcoin either by soft fork, hard fork, or, if the technology is simply not compatible with either of these methods, by taking the existing Bitcoin UTXO set and implementing it on the new technology.

They don't. Futures contracts, whether cash settled or not, are not Bitcoin. They are not decentralized, censorship resistant, or non-repudiable.
From a purely investment perspective, I can see how the futures pull some investor funds away from bitcoin for speculation purposes. But that doesn't change the supply cap of the underlying asset.

I think GiveBitcoin looks like a great option. Before the bitcoin is actually released to the recipient, they have to complete some educational tasks to learn about what Bitcoin is. Also, the transaction is not preformed until the recipient accepts the gift and passes KYC.

Crude summary: Bitcoin transactions are placed into blocks that are created approximately every 10 minutes. Only a certain amount of transactions can be placed in each block. The lightening network takes a lot of transactions off the blockchain by bundling them into fewer transactions that then get placed in the block. This effectively allows more transactions per second, and should also reduce the transaction costs. Disclaimer: I'm not the expert you wanted, but I'm the idiot you got :)

Yea, that's called Dollar Cost Averaging. It's a tried and true investment tool that, when buying a volatile asset, over time should result in you having paid less than the average market price (because when the price low, you end up buying more than when it's high). It's worked great for me over the years investing in traditional markets. I'm confident that over time it will work great or Bitcoin too.
That being said, if I had simply "gone all in" when I first learned about Bitcoin at the end of the last bear market, I'd be a fuckingmoonlambobillionaire.

Step 1: Buy a small amount (maybe .02 - 0.05 of a bitcoin) privately using Paxful, and a gift card that you paid cash for (like a Walmart card). You'll pay a premium to do this, but it's well worth it to keep your identity away from the honeypots AKA centralized exchanges.
Step 2: Use this bitcoin as a deposit to make purchases on Bisq ([bisq.network](
Step 3: Thank me later.
If you can't buy on Paxful, try to find some way to buy enough bitcoin for the deposit Bisq requires through some means that you don't have to provide your identity. Maybe a local meetup, or a friend that will loan it to you.

But if you have an emergency and have to sell the bitcoin when it's down, it could painful.

Paxful (paxful.com) is an exchange that lets you buy bitcoin from other users with many different methods of payment, one of which is a Walmart gift card. So you can buy a Walmart gift card anonymously with cash, and then exchange it for Bitcoin on Paxful.
Then you install the Bisq exchange on your PC, and transfer the bitcoin to the Bisq wallet (included in the Bisq software). Then you can either accept an existing offer on Bisq, or create your own offer to buy Bitcoin and wait for someone to accept it.
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:19:03
An example is probably the best way to see it. Let's say you are using Dollar Cost Averaging to purchase $100 of Bitcoin every Sunday. The first Sunday, a single bitcoin cost $10, so you buy 10 of them. That week, there is a bull run, and by next Sunday, a single Bitcoin is $25. So when you buy $100 of Bitcoin, you are only buying 4 bitcoins.
The key is to spend the same amount of fiat in regular intervals, and avoid FOMO buying. I'm great at this with traditional markets, where I have automated 401K and IRA investments, but TBH, I simply can't resist FOMO buying additional Bitcoin during dips.

I certainly think it's possible that volatility will decrease substantially. The main reason that is so volatile and manipulable right now is that is still a small, illiquid market. This allows a relatively small amount of money to move the market. However, if/as the market continues to grow, it will take more and more money to move it.

Read up on BIP32 and BIP39 before you make your decision. Essentially, there would be one master seed key from which all the other private keys are generated (BIP32). The mnemonic seed phrase is simply that master seed key encoded into a 12-24 word phrase (BIP39).  You don't need to keep both the seed key and the word phrase. But the BIP39 mnemonic phrase is much easier to memorize than the private key, and less prone to data entry/typo errors.

The best way to buy without giving up privacy and not paying a high premium is to use Bisq. The problem is you need some Bitcoin (about .02 should be enough to get started) to use as a security deposit. If you can, go to a meetup and buy some for cash. Some Bitcoin ATM's do not require ID for purchases under a certain amount. Or get a gift card from Walmart or some other retailer that you can use on Paxful without identifying yourself. Once you have enough Bitcoin to make a deposit, either accept an offer on Bisq, or create your own offer to buy.

Bitcoin does incentivize saving and spending, but not simultaneously. As it goes through price discovery, there will be high volatility. When the price is low, it incentivizes saving, as people hold on to it in expectation of higher prices in the future. When the price is high, people feel wealthy and spend it.
But imagine a future where Bitcoin does become a globally adopted currency and a unit of account. This price discovery would have ended, and the bitcoin price (more accurately referred to as "value" or "buying power" at this point) would have stabilized, but probably would still increase slowly along with global economic output. This is the case most people talk about when they claim that nobody will spend a deflationary currency. However, people will still need clothing, housing, transportation, etc. People will still want education, luxuries, and experiences. People will still buy things, but in general, less would be spent on frivolous things that lose value quickly.
These are not my original thoughts, and I'm certainly not a wordsmith or an economist. For a better explanation of these ideas, research the Austrian school of economics. I think "The Bitcoin Standard" is a great place to start if you're interested in Bitcoin. [

Bitcoin Core is the most popular software implementation of the original Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin, by a group of people who believe that on-chain scaling can work, and that it is more important than decentralization and censorship resistance. These "big blockers", as they are often referred to because of their support of larger on-chain blocks, believe that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin, and often refer to Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core rather than simply as Bitcoin. It really makes this whole matter more confusing than it already is.
Bitcoin supporters have a different, more nuanced, view of the trade-offs that must be made in order to scale on-chain. On chain scaling makes it much more expensive to run a full node, which will likely lead to centralization, and weaken censorship resistance. Much like the layered approach of TCP/IP, Bitcoiners prefer to keep the layer 1, on-chain protocol lean, and use 2nd layer, and eventually more layers, to handle scaling. This is a longer term strategy, and takes more work than simply increasing the block size, but if successful will lead to a much more decentralized, censorship resistant protocol than on-chain scaling.

PayPal has a high risk of the buyer reversing payment after receiving the bitcoin. Bisq only supports fiat payment methods that are very difficult to reverse. If you're looking to use these type of payment method, you'll end up paying a premium. Paxful and HodlHodl both support PayPal I think.
Edit: You don't deposit any fiat or Bitcoin with Bisq (except for a small Bitcoin security deposit that goes into a multi-sig contract to discourage fraud). You pay the seller directly, and the seller sends the Bitcoin directly to you. Bisq never has custody of your fiat or your Bitcoin.

I think you can use your debit card to purchase Bitcoin with the Abra wallet.
It's really easy to reverse a payment on PayPal, so the seller is taking on that risk, and you'll pay a premium, but I think Paxful supports it.
If you're willing to consider other payment options (like gift cards for example) you can use them on Paxful too, some of them without providing any ID.
Also, check out Bisq, which supports a variety of payment methods (not PayPal or Debit though) and is peer-to-peer, decentralized, non-custodial, and non-AML/KYC.

Yea, I understand that, and it certainly makes sense. But I think maybe the decision makers at the old institutions still want the warm cozy feeling of dealing with custodial providers that have a long track record, even if it's not a track record with Bitcoin. If they custody their bitcoin with State Street, and it gets stolen, nobody would blame them for choosing State Street. If they choose Coinbase, and it gets stolen, they would look stupid for choosing such a comparatively young upstart. So instead, they wait. Again, this is conjecture on my part.
I completely agree with the sentiment that these custodial solutions are antithetical to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-05 16:52:43
If Bitcoin is only $100, I don't think it will be a usable everyday currency. For it to be a usable everyday currency, it has to be widely distributed among the population. At $100 USD, that means a total market cap of $2.1 Billion. There are about 250 Million adults in the US, so $2.1B / 250M Adults = $8.40 each. If you then consider the rest of the adult world population and the permanently lost bitcoins, that value per person becomes even more negligible.
Rather, I think what these sceptical economists believe is that Bitcoin will never become a usable everyday currency.

My understanding is that this feature isn't supposed to improve privacy. It's simply a method of making chain analysis more expensive, so that if you have some tainted coin, you can still send it to regulated entities if they only check back 5 hops. In theory, this should improve fungibility.

Only a handful of entities are considered or approved as "qualified custodians" to provide custody services to investment firms. (Coinbase, Bitgo, and Gemini are the only ones I know of.) None of those institutions have a long track record, and are generally not trusted by traditional financial institutions. Bakkt will change this, as ICE, owner of Bakkt, has a long history of providing these custodial services to traditional financial institutions.
Payment services, shakepay, and debit/credit cards backed by Bitcoin are completely irrelevant to a discussion about custody solutions for traditional institutional investment firms.

CBOE and CME do not provide Bitcoin custody services. They offer cash settled futures, and never take custody of nor deliver any bitcoin. They are not relevant to a discussion about custodial services.

That's a straw man argument. What libertarians actually believe in regards to how people behave is that people generally cannot be trusted with power, and therefore should be not be entrusted with the power to run our lives.
In the case of Bitcoin, this relates specifically to the belief that we can't trust the people with their hands on the levers of the monetary system not to inflate the money supply.

The thing to understand is that there really are no coins. I think it's better describe them as entries on a ledger, and you can only use those entries as an input to another ledger entry (in other words, you can only send the bitcoin) if you have the private keys for it. These keys are what are in your cold storage wallet.
When a chain forks, you can think of it as a copy being made of the ledger, and all the existing entries on the original ledger are also on the new ledger. So, all your private keys will work on both ledgers. But, transactions made on one chain are not present on the other chain.
However, if there is no replay protection, it is possible that if you send "coins" on one chain, somebody could replay that transaction on the other chain, even if they don't have access to your private keys. So before moving anything around, make sure you understand what's going on and how to protect yourself.

Again, what Bakkt is offering that is unique is custodial services and bitcoin settled futures by an established, traditional financial institution. While CBOE and CME are established, traditional financial institutions, neither offer custody solutions nor bitcoin settled futures. As far as I know, there are no established, traditional financial institutions that do so.
Whether or not there is pent up demand for these services is another discussion. I keep hearing that there is, but I'm just a pleb with no insider info and little trust in what I hear in the media. But I have to think the people behind Bakkt and Fidelity Digital Assets must believe there is some demand for these services, or they wouldn't invest all the resources to bring them to market.

I don't think Beauxyy is claiming that regulations will help. He's just saying that the historical charts are made from data collected while regulations were not in place, so their accuracy for predictions into a time period where regulations are in place would be suspect.
That being said, regulations could lower the quantity of scams in the crypto space, and give it an air of legitimacy, thus making it more inviting to retail investors. Also, I think that institutional investors would not be able to invest in (or at least, would be very hesitant to invest in) un-regulated markets, and maybe with regulations in place they could invest.

Bitcoin does not need an ETF. It doesn't need anything from the banking, finance, or government sectors.

@_date: 2019-01-17 20:30:26
Sure, I have doubts. For starters, the value of any money is simply a shared delusion. Presently, many people share in the delusion that fiat has value. A very small percentage of people currently share my delusion that Bitcoin is worth something. What if this shared delusion never becomes accepted by the masses?
What if some catastrophic bug is exploited?
What if wall street fuckery hypothecates bitcoin in the extreme?
What if some alt-coin does manage to come up with some bitcoin-killer feature, and we can't reach consensus to adopt it?
What if my anarcho-capitalist ideology is leading me to see only what I want to see?
What if my perception reality is so far off from actual reality that my judgement is completely unreliable?
But, even with these doubts, I believe that in the long term, the dis-inflationary, censorship resistant, border-less nature of bitcoin will make it a better store of value than other currencies and precious metals. So I DCA a portion of my income into bitcoin, just like I do with other traditional investments.

If you're interested in the benefits of decentralization (I would assume you are since you're interested in Bitcoin) check out [bisq.network]( It's the most decentralized exchange, it's non-custodial, and does not perform KYC or AML procedures. All transactions are performed on-chain, so it's a bit more complicated and slower than centralized exchanges, but not difficult. While the volume on Bisq is definitely increasing, it can still take a while to find an offer you like, or for someone to accept an offer you make.
For me, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.

Proof of Keys is not exchange specific. It's meant for people that hold coins on any exchange.
@_date: 2019-01-01 13:32:21
If you don't hold the keys to your coins, you don't own your coins. When you use a 3rd party to custody your coins, they have the keys, they own the bitcoin, and you only hold a promise from them to give you the coins when you ask for them.
Since the 3rd party actually owns the coins, they can do what they want with them. They can lend them out, sell them, or... not even possess them in the first place. How do you really know that when your exchange says you have bitcoin, that they are actually holding them for you? How do you know that your account balance is nothing more than an entry in a database on their server?
In other words, they could have fractional reserves, like the fiat monetary system. This creates an artificial increase in the supply of bitcoins, which puts a downward pressure on price.
Proof of Keys is meant to force these custodial 3rd parties to proof that they actually have the coins they claim to have and are not practicing fractional reserve policies.
@_date: 2018-11-28 13:48:10
According to Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler, the recent delay of their launch was in part because “the pipeline filled up with customers”. That sounds like maybe there is pent up demand. Also, SEC Chairman Clayton recently said that custody offerings still "need to be improved and hardened." I think traditional financial institutions would be hesitant to use the current custody services that the SEC publicly states need to be improved.
So I think you're right, there may be some others who feel just as I describe.

Bisq does not require an ID. It is the most decentralized exchange that supports fiat (out-of-band via many payment methods like face-to-face, postal money order, bank deposit or transfer, and Zelle.) It does not perform KYC/AML procedures, it is non-custodial and peer-to-peer.
The drawbacks are the volume is low (it is increasing) and you have to deposit some bitcoin as a security deposit to buy some.

For your use case, I think Bisq ([ and a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger would be great. Bisq is the most decentralized exchange currently available to purchase bitcoin with fiat. It is non-custodial, does not perform KYC/AML measures, you do not set up an account or provide any identification to them, it's peer-to-peer, and transactions are on-chain. In order to achieve this, there are some drawbacks that you should be aware of:
* The process is a little more complicated, but not difficult.
* Transactions take a little longer than on a centralized, off-chain exchange.
* You have to deposit some bitcoin (as a security deposit) in order to buy bitcoin. (A bitcoin ATM would be a great option to get this start-up amount. 0.02 bitcoin will be enough for most offers, but I've seen a few offers that require .03 or more.)
* Fiat payment is handled out-of-band (there are many payment methods available, including Zelle, bank deposit, bank transfer, postal money order, or face-to-face).
Also, the volume, while growing, is still low. This means that you might have to wait to find an acceptable offer, or if you place your own offer, you might have to wait for someone to accept it. (Note: The transaction fee is lower if you make an offer, than if you accept an offer).
The benefits far outweigh the drawbacks for me, and my current use case is the same as yours.

Bisq does require that you put up a little bitcoin as a security deposit before you can trade, to discourage fraud. So you'll need to earn or purchase some bitcoin elsewhere first.

Imagine if, instead of getting a loan to buy a house, you saved to do so. With inflationary currency, like we have now, that is very difficult to do, because the value of the currency keeps going down. This is what we've become accustomed to in this Keynesian, centrally managed monetary system. But with a deflationary currency, the value of the currency would tend to rise, making saving MUCH easier. In other words, an inflationary currency encourages spending, debt, and high time preference, while a deflationary currency encourages savings and a low time preference.
I agree that the current volatility of Bitcoin makes it difficult to use as a currency right now. But it's a very nascent technology, and still going through price discovery. As adoption increases (as a store of value and as a method of exchange) I believe a more stable price will emerge.

Using a combination of devices and multisig is a great option. For example, Casa's KeyMaster ([ free Silver level uses seedless 2-of-3 multisig. You have one key on your mobile device, one key on a hardware wallet, and Casa keeps one. To send bitcoin, 2 of the keys are required. If one key is lost, Casa will rotate in a new key (for a fee of 0.1% of total funds recovered). You retain complete control over your Bitcoin, have a path to recovery if one key is lost, while making theft more difficult.
The thing that I am not sure about with Casa's implementation: What prevents a rogue developer employed by Casa from getting code into Keymaster that collects the key stored in the KeyMaster app?

Check out some of the youtube videos that the Bisq team has put out. In one of them they do screenshares of both the buyer and seller and demonstrate the whole process. The biggest hurdle to grasping how it works is understanding that Bisq ONLY handles the secure transfer of Bitcoin. The payment (via fiat, or via alt-coins) is not handled by Bisq, they only assist with arranging the payment. Also, you have to have a little bitcoin to get started, because you have to lock up some BTC in each trade to keep you honest.

I think Sherman has a better understanding of the threat Bitcoin poses to the establishment than you give him credit for. The US government has managed to weaponize the global monetary system. Their control over the world reserve currency and payment systems, and their success at forcing other entities to use it, allows the US to benefit from the creation of dollars while insulating itself from the harmful effects of this inflation.
Additionally, the ability of the US government to track and censor transactions allows them to cut off their enemies from the financial system. Bitcoin gives people the ability transact without the US government interfering. This is what Sherman fears. This is different than other international currencies, because the US Government can bribe, sanction, or otherwise influence central banks and traditional payment systems to do what they want.
You're correct that Bitcoin aims to accomplish liberty. Again, this goes directly against the aims of politicians and government. The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground. Bitcoin is a tool that can be used to take back some of the liberty that government has taken.
You're also somewhat correct about the transparency of Bitcoin. But there are tools in place, right now, that allow people to transact in ways that would be very difficult, if not impossible, for governments to track and identify the participants (VPN's, TOR, coin joins, Lightning, etc). And more privacy improvements are coming.
Most governments don't have much reason to fear a new financial system. But the US government, as the main benefactor of the current one, has a lot to lose.

@_date: 2018-12-19 14:26:09
Bitcoin is very volatile now. That doesn't mean it will always be. Consider the possibility that we're going through price discovery now, and that at some point in the future a consensus about the value of bitcoin will be reached. Then the purchasing power of bitcoin would be stable, and it would become much more viable as a currency.

The AA link you posted simply states that banking will become obsolete, not that it will do so quickly.
Satoshis are not yet a good unit of account, since the purchasing power of a Bitcoin is currently so volatile. Bitcoin is currently going through a price discovery, or value discovery, phase, and until that is complete, and there is a general, wide consensus on what the value of a Bitcoin is, it will not make a good unit of account.  Hence, my reference to the dollar, because currently it is more stable than Bitcoin, and hence a better unit of account.
Imagine using a Bitcoin tape measure when building a house. The markings on this tape measure fluctuate with the price of Bitcoin. It would be very difficult and confusing to build a house using this tape measure with the current volatility. Likewise, using something as volatile as Bitcoin currently is will make valuations much more difficult. This is why people who understand the basics of economics still use dollars as a unit of account, even if they believe that Bitcoin could one day replace it.

I agree. If transactions are reversible, that means they can be censored, which would ruin one of the core tenets and benefits of Bitcoin. I think what the OP is stating is: This irreversible nature of Bitcoin transactions could also hinder its adoption as a peer-to-peer currency. 
What I am saying is that Lightning does not provide an answer to this concern, as Lightning transactions are also irreversible.

This isn't for exchanges to participate in, this is for people that keep their coins on exchanges. On Jan 3rd of each year, these people will take ownership of their coins by withdrawing them to a wallet that holds the private keys. If the exchange doesn't actually have all the coins to cover these withdrawals (in other words, they are using a fractional reserve policy), they have to go out and buy these coins to honor the withdrawals, or simply decline the withdrawal request.

Much better at what? Store of value, decentralization, immutability, security? You're gonna have a hard time making a case for any of those. Privacy and fungibility? A case could be made for Monero and Dash, but improvements for both of these issues are coming to Bitcoin, either on the base layer or built on top of it. Confirmation or transaction time? Yea, I guess so. But if you consider the amount of security you get with each confirmation, it takes a lot more time with these alt coins to reach the same level of security you get with one Bitcoin confirmation.
Maybe these altcoins are better for your use case. But for me, (and evidently for many others, if you look at volume and market cap) Bitcoin is so much better than alt coins.

Bisq would be your best bet. You can do face to face, money order, Zelle, bank transfer, and other payment methods. It's peer-to-peer and non-custodial, with no KYC/AML procedures. It uses multi-sig contracts, and the buyer has to put up a security deposit, to prevent scammers.

Sure, I see the innovation, and I'm not blinded by price; the low prices are allowing me to accumulate more. I don't follow TAs, and I realize all markets are manipulated to some degree, and I don't keep anything on exchanges. The noise doesn't bother me.
But what you are claiming, that nobody will be using fiat in 5 years, means that Bitcoin will replace the worldwide broad money supply. That's about $90 trillion dollars, which would put 1 Bitcoin at a valuation of about $4.3 million in today's dollars.
It would also mean that all the banksters, elites, and politicians and bureaucrats either very quickly saw the light and got on board, or simply let their wealth and power disappear with hardly a fight. Neither of these situations is likely to happen in the next 5 years.

When you store coins on an exchange, they are not your coins any more, they are the property of the exchange. They can do with them as they please within the limits of the user agreement. All you have at that point is an IOU and a hope that the exchange will honour it when you want to withdraw.

There's no way to know for sure if, when, or what, it's going to do. Your best bet is probably to use dollar cost averaging to accumulate over time. It really helps to calm the FOMO.

As long as the bank met certain requirements (for instance, keeping enough in reserve), the lender of last resort (in the US, the Federal Reserve) could create money and lend it to the bank to cover the withdrawals. Which, of course, inflates the money supply and reduces the purchasing power of everyone that holds dollars.
Please note that I'm not defending fractional reserve banking, I prefer hard, sound money. That's one of the great things about bitcoin: There is no lender of last resort. There can't be, because you can't create bitcoin out of thin air. If bitcoin does become financialized by Wall Street, and they try to play fast and lose with "fractional reserve bitcoin", eventually they will get caught with their pants down. And bitcoiners (who of course have their private keys) will not be affected.
@_date: 2018-12-15 23:41:01
Why are you worried? Have blocks stopped being produced? Have the devs stopped developing? Have transactions been censored? Has any serious vulnerability been exploited? Has the 21M hard cap been violated? Has consensus failed? None of this has happened. What is happening is more infrastructure is being built built, improvements are being made to the core protocol, and 2nd layer scaling solutions are moving forward.
Don't get me wrong, I feel your pain about the low price. If you've invested heavily it can be scary to see it dip this far. But Bitcoin is better and stronger now than when you first invested in it.

You could use Bitcoin ATM's or LocalBitcoins to get started, even though you might not get a good price, or might have to pay high fees. Once you have a small amount to use as a security deposit, you can start using Bisq, which does not require any KYC, and has very reasonable fees.

I love this quote from Daniel Buchner. It wasn't his intention, but I think it sums up why shitcoins will have such a hard time competing with Bitcoin:

Fractional reserves have a downward pressure price, because it increases supply, even though that increased supply is not really bitcoin. If Proof of Keys is successful, it will encourage exchanges that use fractional reserves to increase their reserves, which would reduce this fake supply and reduce the downward price pressure.
@_date: 2018-12-15 23:27:32
Miners are rewarded for every block they produce. At the beginning, the miner that mined a block was rewarded 50 bitcoins. This mining reward is the only way to create bitcoin. (Note: miners are also paid by transaction fees from the transactions in the block they produce, but these are not new bitcoins.)
Every 210,000 blocks (or about 4 years), this reward is cut in half. There have been 2 of these halvenings to date, so the current reward is 12.5 bitcoins. The next halvening will occur 2020, and the reward will be cut in half to 6.25 bitcoins.
The theory is that since price is determined by supply and demand, and the supply is cut in half, the price should increase. However, some argue that everyone already knows about the decrease to supply, so it's already priced in. If that's the case, in order for mining to stay profitable, either transaction costs have to go up, or the hash rate has to go down.

I buy  bitcoin all the time, and I've never used or owned USDT. None of the exchanges I use even support it or price Bitcoin in it. Even if they did, USDT has been able to keep it's peg to the dollar pretty well. So how can you tell whether Bitcoin is being priced in USDT or the dollar?
The market cap of USDT is less than $2.9B, a small fraction of Bitcoin's nearly $95B market cap. Also, it seems clear that USDT is 74% backed. That means that only 26% (or $0.75B) of it's market cap is un-backed. So if USDT is artificially inflating the price  of Bitcoin, then I would argue that it is only doing so with this un-backed portion of it's market cap.
And if USDT disappears,  don't you think that the people using or providing USDT/BTC pairs would find another way to continue trading?

You're still missing, or intentionally ignoring, the OP's point. His point has nothing to do with privacy. It has to do with the irreversible nature of Bitcoin transactions, and Lightning (thankfully) does not change that.
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:17:35


Using Bitcoin to purchase things does not make it a unit of account.


Incorrect. The purchasing power of the dollar is currently stable compared to the purchasing power of Bitcoin. For example, one year ago, I could have bought a Honda Accord for $25,000. If I did so using Bitcoin, it would have cost about 1.25 Bitcoin. Today, I can still buy a new Accord for about $25,000, but if I wanted to use Bitcoin it would cost about 6.25 bitcoin. You can repeat this little math problem with almost anything. Bread, gas, real estate, clothing, furniture, and the result is the same: The purchasing power of Bitcoin is currently too volatile to become a decent unit of account. Once Bitcoin achieves mass adoption and a general consensus is reached about it's value, this will change.
 
@_date: 2018-12-24 07:45:52
Bitcoin is stable. The supply cap hasn't changed. A block is mined every 10 minutes. It remains censorship resistant. What is volatile is the value that many people place on it. Some of us place a very high value on it, and therefor don't want to let go of it. This decreases the amount that is offered for sale, and applies an upward pressure, causing other people to place a high value on it. At some point, a general consensus about the value of bitcoin will be reached, and that's when I'll start spending it.

The problem with using PayPal to sell Bitcoin is that while Bitcoin transactions are not reversible, PayPal transactions are. So the buyer could easily reverse the transaction after receiving the bitcoin, and you're out of luck. If PayPal is the only method you will accept, make sure you get a premium for taking on that risk.
If you're willing to use other payment methods, then I highly recommend that you check out Bisq, the most decentralized, peer-to-peer exchange. Bisq supports many different payments methods, and your risk of getting cheated is MUCH lower. Bisq only supports payment methods that make reversals extremely difficult, and the buyer also has to put up a security deposit that they lose if they are dishonest.
The biggest downside of Bisq is that the volume is low (but growing), so you might not be able to sell as quickly as you like.

What you are describing is not a reversed transaction, but simply a new transaction that is initiated by the receiver in the original transaction. When people refer to "reversible transaction" in the financial sense, they generally mean that a 3rd party has the power to reverse the transaction.

@_date: 2018-12-15 23:16:00
No, they actually don't. There are some bitcoin owners that don't know about the halvening, most people who don't own bitcoin yet don't know about the halvening, and all of the people who don't even know about bitcoin yet don't know about the halvening.

From the OP, he's asking if Bitcoin transactions should be:


Does the Lightning network provide for transactions that are policed, correctable, and reversible?
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:23:10


Incorrect. Decentralized peer-to-peer exchanges like Bisq do not gather any info. You don't even, you *can't* even, create an account on their platform.
Also, the Bisq client runs over TOR, so your IP address is hidden. And you can easily use a VPN for another layer of privacy.


Again, not true. Transactions on the Lightning network are not  logged on the blockchain. Furthermore, chain analysis is far from perfect, and there are tools (included in wallets like Wasabi) to make it even more difficult to associate on chain transactions with a person.

If you're taking someone else's offer, it might be something different, and once you click "Take Offer", a window pops up with details including the required deposit, mining fees, and exchange fees.
