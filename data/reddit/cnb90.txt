I have a question:
If the Federal Reserve wants higher inflation numbers which to them would signal an expanding economy, what would be the benefit of *under*-reporting inflation?

Wow, I never thought of such possibilities now it makes more sense. My knowledge of economics is very little, basically what I've read from articles here and there.
Thanks for the link, I will definitely investigate this further.

Indeed, for now people will continue using their bank accounts and cash as normal. But someday, digital currency will become the norm. Who knows if Bitcoin or any other current coin could be around by that time, but someday the Federal Reserve for instance may start issuing digital USD.
For now, digital currency like Kenya's M-pesa are gaining popularity in areas with little to no access to banks or ATMs. And it's a transparent currency unlike Bitcoin so from a legal standpoint that would clear a lot of hurdles on the path to other countries starting to use a similar system.
Until then, yes, the market is too unstable for the majority of people to store their savings in Bitcoins.

For conversion fees, I have yet to convert BTC to USD so I don't have first hand experience. But I've looked at the costs and from what I can tell, some exchanges charge between 0.5% and 0.2% depending on your monthly transaction volume.

I'm not who you asked, but I thought of two revenue streams that could be disrupted.
1. Money transfer fees - It costs up to 5% of the total transaction to send money from one bank account to another. Instead of going through banks, the money could be converted to Bitcoin, sent to an address, and converted back to dollars for much less. Businesses, charities, and people sending money from bank to bank probably generates a lot of fees.
2. Checking/savings accounts - Perhaps we could see a future where people en masse store their savings in Bitcoin and other coins on hard drives, thumb drives, phones, etc. instead of in a bank account. Without those accounts, banks would have to lend less money since they have to keep at least a certain percentage of their total assets in cash. They lost money on the interest they could be charging to someone who needs a loan.
