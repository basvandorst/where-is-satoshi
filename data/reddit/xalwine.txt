They ran out of coins earlier. So people are hesitant to buy because they would get coins at Fridays price, but are still willing to sell.

You have to change it to usd and do a flat amount in fiat. That should let you buy less than .1

I've had nothing but good experiences with Coinbase. But I don't create a new thread every time I successfully buy/sell Bitcoin. and and any of the others have done a great job picking up the stray issues that get posted here.

If you do a recurring buy on coinbase you can do a smaller amount.

BA means that your classload is mostly related to your major with some other classes used to fill credits. 
BS means that every class you took related to your major. 
At least thats how I learned it.

Maybe instead of having "0.000" for the price of items that can be customized, have the word "Customize" or something along those lines.
Alternatively, have the price range under the item. 
Also it looks like you pull the images for all the items from the respective websites, Maybe have some uniformity where you can, such as soda/pop logos.

Unless you have 5k+ in ASIC equipment, get your electricity for free, and found a bitcoin shitting unicorn, you wont make any money mining. 
**edit:** you want tips, sell your equipment and buy coins.

I picked up 5 of them for about 45 bucks off of bitmit, I've had them going 24 hours a day on my work computer for about 3 days. I've made ~$1.50 back. I bought them for the hobby of bitcoin mining. I won't make my money back in any time, and at this rate, I should have bought coin with it if I wanted to make money. 
I could "contract" the usage of my miners on ebay and make money that way, but it seems dishonest to charge 10 bucks for a weeks worth of mining when the person will only get about $3 worth of return IF that. I'd rather take the hit for what I paid, help hash out some coins, and use them to make bitcoin a currency that matters. What good is bitcoin if its only stored in wallets? 
When would you see a return on investment? Well if you're using a free computer, and free electricity, and if the difficulty never changed, it would take you over 8 months to see a single satoshi in profit. With difficulty rising as it is, Honestly, it will be much, much longer than that. 
Good luck, and if you're interested in experiencing the mining aspect of bitcoin, grab one cheaper. check out bitmit.com or even ebay. $25 is WAY too high for one of those.

If anything the episode would play out like this: 
Cartman begins rallying against the dollar and how corrupt banks are, promoting cryptocurrency. Stan and Kyle think its odd that Cartman is so invested in this and seems to be making informed financial decisions. It turns out that Cartman is DPR2 and running the silk road from his basement.

coinbase added credit card verification. Add a visa and it will be instant again.

You can. And you have been able to for a long time now. There's even a link on the goddamn sidebar.

   You can get your QR code online at any QR generator. Just put in your wallet ID. Then move that image to this site and you'll have your pin. You can even put "I accept Bitcoin" on the pin itself.

I got that too. It's a new account (only 30 minutes old) and whats sad is, my SOB story is worse than theirs. They responded when I told them I couldnt send any, with: 


I dunno if its an auto response or what, but they are going after everyone who mentions bitcoin.

You have to select USD, and it will allow you to buy less than .1 btc.

There will be stabilization, and it will fluctuate until it hits its rhythm, think of a guitar string being plucked, but as far as purchasing, there are two schools of thought: 
* Buy now at whatever price for whatever you can afford, or 
* buy smaller chunks over the course of a few weeks. The price will fluctuate, and you can possibly negate any losses from the price rising or sinking. 
As for me, I'm doing the latter. I have spent too much time waiting for it to drop again. Oh, its at 120, I'll buy at 100. Oh its at 150, I'll wait for 120 again. Oh shit, its 260, I'll wait for 230 again. 
Since I spread out over time, I can get some when if valleys and some at when it peaks. I've still made a profit of $85 in the last two months. I'm sure there are others who play more of a daytrader role and net more, but for a casual, I feel like its good enough for me. I'm still planning on holding "To the moon!"

Looks like it may have dropped because of sell panic. It's climbing back up. 
As much as I want it to drop so I can buy more, it looks like it's not going to stay down. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:12:20
It's the easiest way to make small purchases. I like it so I can get $10 a week no matter what the cost. Helps offset any peaks and valleys.
