Everyone who wants to go ahead and see what happens in a 51% attack can go and see what happened to many altcoins after a 51% attack. Its not pretty.

So has one any talked to a real person yet?

I recently tweeted at them suggesting they accept Bitcoin. I've been tweeting at many major companies urging them to use bitcoin with the hashtag

I have been wondering this for a long time. I thought for sure another exchange would have taken their place by now.

Great stuff. I plan on linking this frequently to newbies.

I think this happened in 2011 after Mt.Gox was hacked. People forget that Mt.Gox has been around a while and through a lot and somehow has always managed to continue on. Less than one year ago it was the only exchange to trade on that had any kind of decent volume. Mt.Gox has been a bitcoin staple for many years. When people think Mt.Gox they think Bitcoin. Yes it has sucked for a long time. It has always hard laughable customer service, no transparency, and a knack for "glitching" or going down just at the right time. I have seen many exchanges come and go and for a long time I thought Mt.Gox would be one of them, but time, and time again Mt.Gox would continue on. I do think this most recent screw up is a detriment to bitcoin, and I think it would be much worse, if Gox were to shut down without paying people back or letting them withdraw coins.

I have no idea what any of this means 
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:05:34
so did anyone call yet?

I found this post on a google search. There is a good bitcointalk thread about the subject

I'm getting married in a few weeks, and there have been many vendors (catering, cake, wedding planner, invitations, etc) that I wish I could have paid in Bitcoin. Most of them take checks which now feels so antiquated. I especially worry about security if I have to send checks through the mail.

There are many reasons to shop elsewhere

"If you are using this library for trading"  do you mean Mt.Gox? I'm not very tech savy and don't know what a library is referring to.

What are you talking about? Gox has been having withdrawal problems for months. Gox isn't even in the US!

People have been saying India is the next country to hop on Bitcoin.

The harder it gets to wire USD the more interest we will see in BTC. It provides a simple solution to all of the fee's, waiting periods, bank/goverment BS. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:06:09
This seems entirely legit 
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:09:01
Does this mean that no one will be allowed to trade on BTCCHINA? 
@_date: 2013-10-08 01:14:34
buy them all at once on Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, or Bitfinex, and let me know an hour in advance ;)

God I hate the website [theblaze]( It's just full of ridiculously over-dramatized Glen Beck paranoia crap.
