I'm not unhappy about it.  I got in at £250

Can you tell me, in words of few syllables, why I shouldn't use a web based wallet on my phone to buy BTC from an ATM?  
I have done this a couple of times already and had no problem so far.  Actually it worked a treat - really quickly. And was tremendously satisfying.

Alas, I suspect you are right.  I was kind of hoping for a return of at least 10% of my MtGox bitcoin via Kraken.  Realistically though, I guess I won't see anything at all.  They are dragging out the process.  Next information isn't due til mid February according to the translated docs from the trustee.

Find a bitcoin ATM.  There aren't many of them and their rate is not as good as you might find online but they work.  Feed in cash and see the balance on your phone wallet in seconds.

I had mine with Mt Gox and now they're gone.  But Hey!  It was a fun ride and totally worth it.  I only put $100 in and got to see them increase 10 fold.  I was just stupid enough not to take them out of the Mt Gox wallet.  Oh well.  Live and learn.

I had no idea I lived in a D5 nation.
In truth, I didn't even know there was such a categorisation.

Estonia is one of the ‘Digital
5’ or D5 group of nations, of which the other members are the UK, Israel, New
Zealand and South Korea.

Honestly?  This year yes.  It would have been better last year.  Or 4 years ago.
But right now?  Today?  No.  Hang on a bit.

Just checked before reporting.  Dammnit!  It's fixed.
@_date: 2016-12-14 17:37:59
Agreed.  I noticed this long ago, like months ago.  And then again last week.
I should have reported.  I will do so now. fwiw
@_date: 2019-08-19 17:37:24
Is this same post in ?  I should go have a look ....
@_date: 2016-12-14 17:40:12
Me again.  I was wrong.
I'd forgotten I am on the "other" computer and using Duck Duck Go
Just ignore me and my comments ....

Does this mean I might get my Bitcoins back?  I have filed via Kraken and as far as I know some kind of judgement for creditors is due soon.
@_date: 2019-12-05 17:49:01
I had a coin once.  Ages ago.  Technically it should still be mine - but MtGox took it.

I don’t care. Bitcoin owes me nothing. As long as its value is more than $50 , I haven’t lost anything. And if it fell below that, I still wouldn’t care. It’s been a hell of a ride. 
Hodl on. Keep on hodling on.  ‘Cos, so what.

woooo hoooo!  I have only got 1 BTC, but I bought it nearly two weeks ago!  Best investment ever!
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:43:48
I'm a Bitcoiner, a Mt Gox customer and a redditor.
All I have to say right now is Thank you.  You seem to be doing a pretty good job in the face of immense adversity.  I'm one of those thousands who signed up over the last 3 weeks and I've had something interesting to talk about in the pub!  And although I cannot actually see what the current value of my "investment" is, I'm surely glad to have it...whatever it's worth.  And I wouldn't have it without you!

My friends keep saying "When are you going to cash in?"  I tell them I am waiting for the $100K  !
