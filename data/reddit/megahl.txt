Lots of people have had problems using shapeshift (check the subreddit for proof). I'd not recommend them. Changelly would be the other option but I don't have experience with them.

There's also an ongoing investigation about ING Banks involvement regarding fraud, so they're probably just afraid about the development of crypto's.

are you using Bitcoin Core?
@_date: 2017-05-20 19:55:38
Ah okay, I didn't know that...I'm afraid I can't help you any other way then, sorry!

Yeah the full blockchain takes ~123 Gb of space on your harddrive. You can however configure Bitcoin Core to prune, so it only uses a fixed amount of space. I currently have it at at a few gigs, but I'm not sure how it works with a fresh installation.
To configure it download, install and setup your Bitcoin Core wallet. then navigate to Users&gt;*your pc's name*&gt;Appdata&gt;Roaming&gt;Bitcoin and add a text file with the line: prune=550 
550 is the minimum which should be around 2 days of data. Higher number means more space reserved for the blockchain. 
Just a brainstorm of mine, on a fresh installation it will likely 'fill' the blockchain over the course of time untill the fixed amount of space is reached.
I hope I was of any use, I just untill recently found out about the prune option so I'm not really familiar with it yet. If it didn't help you, sorry and best of luck finding an other way!
