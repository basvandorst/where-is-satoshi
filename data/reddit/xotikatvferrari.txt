We have removed the XOtikaTV label in the QR code, so from now on no wallet, including Mycelium, should link your transactions with the website’s name. All new transactions that you do should appear as anonymous. As Rassah says, you should remove or rename the XOtikaTV address book entry to clear the labeling on the transactions that are currently listed as “XOtikaTV”.

I am the Community Administrator of XOtika.TV, I go by the moniker Ferrari.
For anyone that is interested the best way to contact me is via Skype.  It is the least untimely way to contact me, e-mails and Reddit personal messages will almost certainly receive responses with significant delay compared to Skype instant messages.

I am the Community Administrator over at [XOtika.TV](  It is a great place for bitcoiners to come and hang out with a community of fellow cryptographic currency enthusiasts.  I also am greatly pleased that it serves the global community as a way for anyone to come and broadcast themselves, their content, and become a part of a “real world” bitcoin economy.  An economy in which bitcoin is earned and used by people interested in if for its usefulness to them for paying for their daily expenses.  Channel hosts on [XOtika.TV]( earn bitcoin that many of them then, that day, convert to dollars or euros or whatever is their country’s currency and use for groceries or housing expenses or fancy shmancy hairdos or whatever they choose.  It’s a great thing.
Anyway, everyone is welcome to come and hang out with all the cryptonerds, sexy channel hosts . . . oh, and those Bitcoin Uncensored crazies too.  ;)

There are as many answers to that question as there are people in the industry, practically.  . . . there is a heck of a lot of “only partial disclosure” as opposed to “full disclosure”, that is for sure . . . but a good number are up front about it as well.
