Since I'm "that guy" I figured I'd make a post about this :)
First, for the record: most of the Bitcoins I produce are sent to investors who have placed capital or equipment with me.  I keep a share of coins which I then use to re-invest into more mining facilities, payroll, insurance, rent...etc.  Building an industrial mining business is very capital intensive!
Have I made my investors millions?  Most certainly.  Am I a millionaire?  That depends on your definition.  No - I don't keep thousands of BTC on ice, but I do have over 2 megawatts of dedicated transaction processing facilities (and no debt!).  Like any business owner in America, most of the revenue I make goes back into supporting and growing the business and an awesome group of teammates - not to mention taxes.
One important thing to understand about *all* the large mining operations - we are a commodity producer and as such are very very price sensitive.  We should sell most (all) the coins we mine in order to avoid doubling down on risk.

Watch out for BitMain copy site scams - dont make your Black Friday take you into the red! (see what I did there)

It hasn't been easy.  Bitcoin is China's now.

I only use BitMain miners right now.  Is anyone getting BW or BF miners?

These days you can make 10PH with only a single megawatt.  A 2PH launch is only about 145 BitMain S9's using only 200kW (1/5th of a megawatt).
I'm putting more than that in my back yard.
