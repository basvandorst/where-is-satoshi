ok found the correct wallet enter the pass word it gave the seed 
then what?
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:56:47
okk ill leave it on over night
lord willing
8.85 of my BTC were confirmed and 1.8 unconfirmed on the blockchain since 6/27...
have not use the wallet for like a week or so now...
then when i went to look shows this unconfirmed BTC Status...
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:43:25
no... it takes it all the way
never any problems no matter how many times ive loaded the electrum or the seed
not a 1 2 3 like the video shows?
on my multibit hd wallet shows my BTC in an unconfirmed status...
so in BTC purgatory
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:26:40
did this multiple times
did not work
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:21:16
thanks

ill send you something for the thought
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:31:27
found another method thanks to all...
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:25:47
whats the pass phrase?
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:37:45
multibit has my btc in an unconfirmed status
if you have an email i can send you a screen shot
ive even talked dot keep key
i did the mbexport and everything
different day same results
i think its the hardware or server side?
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:38:50
i typed in the command code and  its asking for passphrase?
what next
what is the passphrase?
is it the numeric(three digit)  or the seeds or the password?
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:33:18
Yes it works but the BTC is showing as unconfirmed?
So how can i move my BTC?
thanks, it frustrating...
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:35:55
man i did this and nothing...
ive done this several times already and have the seed written down
electrum is not accpeting the export from multibit for some odd reason
deep breath
the history did not populate
just a blank electrum ledger
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:15:20
i looked even in my backup hardrive.
never had this folder or file
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:05:48
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:01:46
i dont have  ~/Library/Application Support/MultiBitHD/ file or folder
so does this mean someone stole my folder my keys
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:58:28
Thanks for all the humane people with this issue...
Still the same result...
BTC Gods i need a miracle!
Work in progress...
Gonna keep the electrum running overnight(cross finger...hail mary)
until then...
