what a f***ing idiot.

Don't see where your company is going if im honest your charging though the roof ($1000 discounted price) for merchants to get terminals and then your charging through the roof for customers ($120 annually) to even get a debit card, which from my knowledge are sourced from HK? So lets say they cost very little to make, ideally you need to be building a huge base of customers with a little fee if a fee at all, which will become your selling point to merchants.

Something like this really worrys me, could this happen to sites such as MTGox, coinbase or blockchain.
@_date: 2013-10-23 07:00:44
Can only link a US bank :(
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:45:04
CoinKite will never kick off, your price's are to excessive for something that's not even kicked off yet.
Cards should be free to everyone and terminals should be half price all year round. Who wants to buy a terminal when barley anyone has cards?

Him im going to sing up now living in the UK and find it very hard to get started on exchanges! 
It would also be good if aswell as your email confirmation for withdraws you could also add an optional mobile confirmation on top of the e-mail? just a thought! 
I want the safest place in the world for my bitcoins and there is no way some one is stealing my phone and my email :) thanks
@_date: 2013-10-15 04:45:39

@_date: 2013-11-28 23:00:29

@_date: 2013-10-24 16:45:37
i dont think so im trying to verify to like 6 sites, Just got confirmed on Bitstamp and it says they tak $15 minimum from a bank transfer. I give up. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:20:26
Just tried it out with 0.1 BTC and went to the trade, nice to see it will automatically sell at a higher price available, i selected £259 a bitcoin and it sold for £262 :)
Just a shame about the £10 deposit/withdrawll fee is abit much!

Amazing DJ killed Creamfields!
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:59:38
Yeh i know what your fee's are... but it doesnt cost 120/year to supply some one with a debit card does it... in the long run you will profit but charging some one that fee now for something that really isn't up an running is ridiculous. 
Also stating your paid "standard" account is the "most popular" is obscured, would love to see some figures to back that up, id bet your "saved" account is the most popular... 
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:19:36
Well of course this saying applies to alot of things but doesn't answer my question!
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:29:55
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:42:53
Any chance of lowering your yearly fee.. bit of a joke tbh.
