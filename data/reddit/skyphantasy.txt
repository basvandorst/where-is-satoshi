This is a normal link: 
This is a shortened link: 
But I think some scammers can make a link that looks like belonging to a legit website but actually leads you to whatever they want you to visit... The best practice is probably don't treat any computer as a safe one. Keep the majority of your coins offline.

That's a very informative answer. /s

What he said. If you have a significant holding in Bitcoin and plan to hold long term, you may want to consider hardware wallets such as Trezor or Nano Ledger. If not, there are several online wallet sites. Try to pick the ones which support segwit. The fees are lower.

I want to disagree with them as well. But I need to persuade myself first. For example, the reply by u/igadjeed sounds reasonable. What would prevent such a scenario to occur?
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:51:01
So how soon will I see it disappear? And where do I claim my cut of the profit?

Coinbase has a recurrent purchase tool, but you have to deal with the 1.5% fee. You can also write a script using the API from an exchange that gets executed every certain amount of time. Of course you can also do it manually.

One of his students posted this on Facebook. The third reply was actually "What's the intrinsic value of a currency issued by a central bank?". I had a long conversation with another one of his students and managed to talk him into reading Mastering Bitcoin. Hope he will come around in a year.

I am pretty sure not every Bitcoin user can afford to or are willing to run a full node.
Would random people be using a channel monitored by my node, as opposed to, say a node run by Bitmain/Blockstream/Coinbase? Is there any some of trust required in the process?

They cancelled all sell orders of BCH and still haven't started trading. Don't really know what to post. I honestly want them to start trading soon. During the flash crash yesterday BCH/BTC was at 0.29 on bittrex and I had my sell order at 0.31... I would have got some more BTC if it lasted just a little longer.

Drop your phone and spend 12 hours reading this would always be a better use of your time, even if someone is offering 50% discounted Bitcoin to you.

That's still the highest award among economists, selected by a panel of distinguished economists. Let's not try to discredit their background. After all, Satoshi Nakamoto didn't get tenure in a T1 school for cryptography, as far as we know, right?

Exactly the same! I wonder how many people are like this.

I’m sorry but I didn’t find the link for making the claim... is it open now?

So I made the price plot, but we need to fill in the notable events we think are useful. You can check out the plot here
You can reply here or open an issue on github about what you want to add and what you want to change (e.g. do we want it on the log scale, do we want a different price, etc).
@_date: 2016-06-16 05:23:07
Also, which price do you want to use? There is a Bitcoin Price Index which probably weighs in the price at several exchanges and its historical high was below 1000, do we want to use that? Or do you want Bitstamp?
@_date: 2016-06-16 16:10:00
That's true. I'll try to make it one. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 04:23:39
Actually I can make the plot. Can we come up with some key events (preferably with the date) so I can label them?
@_date: 2016-11-20 20:23:32
Thanks for giving a serious answer! Another part I'm wondering is how the distribution of mining power is like outside China. Would some mining group be able to get 50% if all the mining power from China is gone?
@_date: 2016-11-20 19:30:14
Well... This is a hypothetical question. I know it's extremely unlikely. But I just wonder what will happen if China somehow pulls that off. Care to give a wild guess?
@_date: 2016-11-20 19:38:14
Apparently you wrote nothing other than 'Nothing'. I'm curious why you seem so outraged I'm asking why after seeing such a reply.

Sounds like a good opportunity. Good luck :)

What if these technical methods all fail and these two worlds are separated somehow
@_date: 2016-11-20 19:27:49
The part about why nothing will happen given a large portion of mining is going on in China.
@_date: 2016-11-20 19:20:04
Would you care to elaborate?
@_date: 2016-11-20 20:14:32
Like shutting down the cross-border cables so nothing could get in or out. And again, I'm just wondering how it will  impact the bitcoin world if this hypothetically happens somehow.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:06:47
Thanks for your concern. I have nothing in the core wallet. Was just running a full mode on my spare laptop and noticed the address thing.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:36:24
That's not a good survey though... I suggest you read Andreas' The Internet of Money when you got the time. The understanding of Bitcoin indicated by the options of questions is a little troubling. Study up!

sorry if this is a stupid question. Say I want to prune it to 20 Gb (I installed the bitcoin core GUI). I currently have the bitcoin.conf file in the data folder to be
Is that all I need to do? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:19:10
BCH price rise and miners flood to mine BCH. BCH blocks will come in much higher frequency than 1 block/10 min, and eventually the mining difficulty will rise and make it less profitable to mine BCH. As hash rate comes back to BTC, BTC price will also climb back up, unless someone actually changes the difficulty adjustment mechanism as people mentioned in this post and prevent the adjustment.

Thanks! I was following the same steps as well. Will check again when I go home tonight.

That's true. My electricity bill happens to be covered in my rent and it's a spare laptop. Therefore...

Where are the people who took out a loan to buy Bitcoin in 2014? I guess they are all deep in shit and won't come here anymore.
Don't let the random desirable outcome distract you from the fact that this is idiotic in terms of risk management.
Don't call an all in with top pair. Winning once or twice that way doesn't make it a good play.

I didn't say anything about Tai's course at all. I was only refuting your opinion that Doug has a 'scammy' Poker program. As for Tai, he couldn't even describe his supposed gurus in words other than 'Bitcoin crypto expert'. I doubt he can convince real deals to teach for his courses. Besides, the Princeton course on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies is completely free with open textbooks and programming assignments, and it's not like I've mastered every detail of that course. So why bother with this guy...

My buy order at 5000 never got filled! Liar! I was told there would be dips!
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:19:30
I got really intrigued and pulled some Coinbase price history data to check.
So we have the following two methods:
1. Buy 5.03 USD worth of bitcoin every 12 hours, paying 0.07 USD in fee to Coinbase.
2. Buy 5.10 * 20 = 102 USD woth of bitcoin every 10 days from GDAX. Pay no fees.
For simplicity I assume that there is no price difference between Coinbase and GDAX. Also, I am assuming that you can always buy at the current price on GDAX (i.e. in practice, you place a buy order at the highest bid price and assume it will get filled, that's closest to our assumption).
I tested the price history of different length, starting from a certain point and ending in 2017-7-17 (since that's the latest available price in the data set from 
The results seem to show that the second approach consistently outperform the first approach. Even when we omit the effect of Coinbase fees, the second approach still gives lower average cost to each bitcoin. I think it is pretty counter-intuitive. Not sure why exact it is the case.

They need to do better! My buy order at 1500$ never got filled!
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:08:32
I checked and I think I was making the purchase at 12:00 am and 12:00 pm everyday at Greenwich time. For the GDAX method I just buy at 12:00 am everyday.
I took the data from here, which is the transaction history on Coinbase. At each time of purchase, I pick the nearest price of transaction after the time point to be the price.
I can share the code if you are familiar with R. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:57:36
Thanks for your reply! That's interesting result!
One thing I'm not too sure about is, why do you think the extra compound interest in between those five-day periods are making the difference? My first instinct was that using the Coinbase approach I might be making more since I'm picking up more dips compared to the GDAX approach. Your formula was assuming that Bitcoin is following a nice and smooth exponential growth, yet in fact it has many fluctuations. I'll try and get the real price data and check later.
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:11:51
I tried writing that up about a week ago. I think achieving the core functionality (recurrent purchase) probably takes fewer than 100 lines of Python code. I think the harder part would be to keep track of your account and make sure the device is up at all times so that the script will gets executed every time.
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:37:07
Thanks, this looks great!
I am very recently thinking of doing this. But I was thinking of doing it using Python. Two quick questions. 
1. do you just pick the highest bid price at the moment of execution? I can imagine that there is risk of the price moving quickly so the order either never gets filled or gets filled with the market taker fee. Do you run into these problems?
2. What environment do you use to run the app? I think it probably isn't safe to put the API key on a server. Would it make sense to buy a Raspberry pi for this?

Put a link to Doug Polk's video here! He says it very well!
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:19:09
Well. Doug clearly has credentials in Poker. Tai has none and is shady about the 'top experts' he can gather. I wouldn't use the same prior on them.

I have a silly question about Trezor. What happens if you lose the device somehow?
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:15:39
So what confuses me is this: does the recovery seed contain all the information in the content of the device? Or does trezor stores a copy of my wallet? If the latter doesn't that pose a threat of getting MtGoxed?
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:24:31
Thanks for the link! Hardware wallets sound good and I can afford them. But can I still have the redundant copies with those? I know previously some people save the wallet file in several different places (desktop, usb disk, etc). Can I do the same with hardware wallets?
Edit: I checked out trezor and I am a little confused. It seems that they offer a recovery service in the case if the device is stolen. Doesn't that mean they will store a copy of my wallet somewhere? That seems to pose a danger of getting MtGoxed, doesn't it? Please let me know if I have misunderstood something...
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:02:44
Here's what I don't understand. How are they able to recover the content of a Trezor when it gets stolen? Do they have a copy of the content somewhere?
