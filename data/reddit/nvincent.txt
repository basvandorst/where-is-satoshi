Oh, you must have been blinking at the wrong moment every time. It's pretty crazy though what happens

Holy crap, can they die already so bitcoin can move on?
@_date: 2014-03-17 02:04:17
What is the airdrop?
@_date: 2014-03-20 18:08:55
That is stability right there.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:42:58
I use schwab as my main account, so I am hesitant to use it for bitcoin related things haha. I like them too much to risk them closing my account.

I realize you could measure things in millibitcoin... but it looks so sad when someone say, "wow good thought! Have .00001 of a bitcoin!" As opposed to, "wow good thought! Have 1000 doges!"
It feels better to have 1000 of something, than .0001 of something.

I like the idea of an altcoin for tipping. Just one though... not fifty.
@_date: 2014-05-18 17:43:16
Consistency. Stability. Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 02:07:37
Ah, thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-21 22:34:50
They are the happy coins. $1 is worth something like a million dogecoin. 
(Maybe not a million, but you get the idea.)
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:32:43
Once all the bitcoins are mined, wouldn't they begin to significantly go up in price the more people begin using them, because of the whole scarcity principle? 
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:23:20
I can't think of any specific applications, but if the option were there for touchscreen optimized webapps, I'm sure someone could figure out some kind of interesting or useful idea for it.
@_date: 2014-02-22 00:26:24
Yeah, in terms of market caps, I think they are the number 5 in cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:26:47
Good thing you aren't on @_date: 2014-02-25 18:26:05
Just watched this episode last night for the first time. That show is freaking intense.
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:29:17
This would be nice for chromebooks as well.
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:25:17
Agreed, an android app would be fantastic.
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:45:03
What is the difference, exactly? 
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:30:51
Yeah, I had issues with it this morning. It worked for me about an hour ago though. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 07:42:40
Eh? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:01:51
Do we know this for sure? 
@_date: 2014-02-21 00:45:32
He is really good at *something.*
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:27:48
It moves if you stare at it for long enough.
@_date: 2014-05-06 06:03:39
See? This is actually a g-
*assassinated 
@_date: 2014-02-23 02:13:43
Even if Mtgox comes out of this not bankrupt... why the crap would people continue using them? Have they learned nothing from all of this?
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:59:23
Of all the altcoins, I think they've got the most going for them. The community there is pretty awesome. They also just raised a ton of money for water in kenya, which is no small feat. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 06:14:37
My cat follows the mouse cursor. Maybe someone can make the cursor look like a fly, and it will go splat when it is touched. Instant cat game!
@_date: 2014-02-19 07:49:46
That is still really optimistic. If it happens though... well then I guess my student loans will be paid off.
@_date: 2014-02-21 22:38:06
I love Schwab. I went to china for a semester, and never had to worry about conversion/atm fees. It was awesome. 
Oh, and the other day I got a letter from them saying that an online store I use had data stolen from them, so just in case they are going to send me a new debit card. I am blown away all the time at how awesome they are.
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:16:20
Don't worry, what happened there is actually a good thing. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:26:22
True. Every step closer they have come, the worth of BTC has dropped about $100 USD. I'm guessing there will be one more drop when the final news is announced.
@_date: 2016-11-12 06:07:30
I really think the only thing that would successfully do that is some kind of catastrophic Mr robot-esque situation where the entire economy is essentially destroyed, and we are forced to start over.
@_date: 2019-08-19 00:09:17
This. Either he can or he can't. 
If he announced a magical new Bitcoin 2.0 at the end of all this... Then yeah it's just a PR stunt.
