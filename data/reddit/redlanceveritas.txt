I've only been a part of bitcoin for a couple months now, but I bought a few when they were $300... I'm excited to see where this goes next year.

So, from a consumer standpoint, where then is the incentive to even use bitcoin if what I'm sending is less than than the fee? Or even if the fee is half what I'm sending? That's going to increase my costs by a whopping 50% if it was half. No sane person is going to blindly accept whatever the fee is going to be. If it's too expensive, you can be damn sure that they're going to be moving to any other service.

My aunt is stealing millions of dollars from my grandparents. My grandparents are so old they're mentally incompetent, so she's taking advantage of that by pretending to take care of them while she has them sign over all the deeds and titles to hundreds of acres of land that were in the will to my father and his siblings. She then undersells the land for a fast profit. Shit got real when she tried to sell the farmland my dad makes his livelihood on.
So when my father takes her to court over this, should she be able to use that money to buy the best lawyer in the land? If not, she's dead in the water; if so, she might get away with it.

She's the youngest, and she had my grandparents make her the executor of the will. The oldest, who was the former executor, was never notified and never agreed to that, which is actually is a big no-no in the courts eyes. I think we'll be able to get her on those grounds. There's also strong suspicion of elderly abuse, though no hard proof yet, but I'm pretty confident we'll get her, money or no. She's spending that money fast, so we gotta be on the move. 
Anyway, I guess restricting powers of government comes with certain drawbacks like protecting some criminals. Despite our situation, I'd rather it be this way.
