well you'll just be in the same position as everyone else.. it's not just you who's withdrawing coins from these services with shared pools of coins - other completely innocent people end up holding your dirty coins - will they be sent to prison? no. they weren't laundering money, they were just buying something on bitmit.

Lots of bitcoin services have a sort of account you can deposit bitcoins into and withdraw bitcoins from.. gambling services, bitmit, silkroad, the exchanges, etc. When you withdraw bitcoins from the service you get different coins out than you put in.. do it a few times and there won't be much of a record left for anyone to follow.

I don't think anyone currently offers this -- this is because most prepaid debit card providers work with an outsourced transaction provider by uploading batch files containing the fiat balances of each card to the transaction processor.
In order to do what you suggest they would need to actually receive the CC authorization messages in real time and sell some of your BTC to cover it, also in real time before sending back the authorization. All this would be happening before your transaction gets accepted.
It will happen eventually, but it's sufficiently different to how most prepaid debit schemes operate that it may be some time before someone invests in the software to make it a reality...

well basically it helps because although you might be a suspect in 50 crimes you didn't commit, because you didn't commit them there shouldn't be any evidence they could use to pin those crimes on you.

Insurance fraud happens in the non-bitcoin world all the time.. they manage to mitigate it somehow.. presumably bitcoin depositories would need to charge bitcoin storage fees (like they do on gold) in order to pay for the insurance - that would also tend to remind people to not keep a large balance there unnecessarilly.
