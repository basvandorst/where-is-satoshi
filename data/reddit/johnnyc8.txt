You will self-report and if the IRS has a reason to believe that you're not paying the correct amount of taxes they'll audit you and take a deeper dive. The burden will be on you, not them, to record the fair market values for your transactions.  
I'm not an expert on IRS enforcement so I don't know what specific resources they'll devote to virtual currencies. However, I don't think they'll need a "new branch;" it's really just the same thing they've been doing but with a new asset to examine.

That's a taxable event. You'll have to record that and pair it with your oldest purchase to determine your tax rate on any gains.

Yes, that's a taxable event.

Protip: make sure to pair your oldest purchases with any sales to minimize your tax burden. It takes time to keep track of but It's nothing you couldn't do with an excel spreadsheet and 10 minutes a week. Organizing purchases according to "tax lots" will make your life a lot easier when you're deciding if you want to sell today or hold for a better tax treatment on the gains.

Short-term capital gains can be quite high: as much as 39.6%. On the other hand, the cap for currency gains is 35%.  The effective tax rate will differ from person-to-person with some people faring better with it treated as property and some better if it were treated as currency. In the end, it probably won't have a huge effect. This treatment could actually help people who buy and hold Bitcoins.

You'd use the fair market value for bitcoins, in $USD, at the time of the conversion to litecoins. And because litecoins will be treated the same way as bitcoins, you'll want to record the fair market value for litecoins, in $USD, at the time of the conversion so you know your cost basis for when you eventually sell/convert them.

As someone who works in the financial industry and reads industry press daily, I completely agree. I don't read "vanished" as disappeared, I read it as misappropriated.

At this point, it's the backing of the idea/ideal which give Bitcoins their value. If that backing were to dissolve, or if Bitcoins as a medium for exchange were to present unnecessary risk--as they have recently--it would certainly lose it's value as a currency. 
"Something is worth what someone else will give for it" is true but that axiom would usher in a harsh reality for Bitcoins if they continue to lose their utility -- exchanges down, no price stability, alternatives cropping up, etc...
