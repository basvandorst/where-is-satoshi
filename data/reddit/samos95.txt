Right? I barely kept a summer job and felt on top of the world when I got a car. I get bugged at school all the time because people know I have a mining operation going. Hopefully you won't get trampled lol

I've got this place marked for my next road trip

That's the same thing I ended up doing. Once I perfected my code it found it in under half a second.

Ive been mining at wafflepool

Oh, wow, I live in the neighborhood right behind you guys. I'll have to stop by.

Damn, my code was about to finish.

Having just woken up I thought it meant the actual moon. Like on some space station. So I clicked yes anyway. Once I read the "where is the moon" question I realized and laughed

Haven't had the greatest experience with tiger direct...but you just got another customer back. Will the retail stores be accepting bitcoin as well? I live right next to one and do my shopping from there.

I'm in orlando, can you give any more info on where it will be?

It's so stupid but so simple. It's one of the first things I check for at this point.
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:33:41
Even closer, if you let me know when its up I'll be your first mobile Tahoe ATM user

If I had won that I would not be able to contain myself. Congrats!

This is absolutely correct. Although I would hope a good VPS service has enough redundancy in place so we don't have to worry about something like this. And there may be a lot more people than VPSs but there are still a lot of VPSs out there running nodes. So I would say there is some level of centralization, but very, very low.

I almost bought 1000 LTC at $0.06. When they hit $50 I was kicking myself.
I also started mining BTC with a single GPU when a weeks worth of mining bought me lunch...just kept going for the hell of it, now I'm sitting with a little over $1k and a few very nice GPUs.

This is going to sound absolutely stupid, but does it have the correct date and time?
I've ran into issues in the past where a reset device has a 15 year old date and because of that has issues with SSL certificates (what it uses to encrypt data).
It seems like you're also having internal connectivity issues so I doubt that is the problem, but worth mentioning I guess.

I'm only barely 18. Imagining myself winning that at 16 makes me want to run around the block a few times.
