Also, use an exchange and buy less mainstream coins that are in the top 30 market cap.

It’s no rush.. this crypto gold rush is just starting and it will be a while before everything slows down and people start mass selling I’m sure.

My girlfriend hates me for it.
Follow the money though!

because even though he wrote it wrong on purpose it still is relevant to me.
for example, i had a supervisor that wrote a huge long paragraph on our fridge about how we shouldn't wash our plates with food particles blah blah blah.
so then he writes.
in closing: DO NOT WASH FOOD PARTICLES DOWN THE DRIAN.
but in this case its the word HODL.
and yeah, i get that it's a meme but it still makes me chuckle.
like man, you got that far and then you messed up the last word.

I’ve made 2000 now from TRX BNB and Cardano or w/e.  I just bought high market cap low priced coins that have a higher momentum than lite eth or btc.

it always makes me laugh when someone draws something or writes a big long paragraph and messes up the very last word.

It’s a hobby for me anyway.
I have a pension, 401k, a brokerage account for stock trading.  Losing 3 grand isn’t really all that risky for me.
I have a lot of hope for TRX though!

I made 1000 so far and I only started investing Thursday... I had played with ethereum back in March and had 50 ether but I sold way too soon. Only playing with 3k initially.

Hop on an exchange like Binance and you can buy way more types of coins.

I started with 3000 usd.
