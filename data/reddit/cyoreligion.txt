Honestly, this is pretty damn encouraging watching it resist at this level. I'm sure it will drop more but I don't think we'll see 800

Facing some early, albeit faint, resistance at least

I think we are seeing that the PUBLICITY of the ETF was better for bitcoin than it getting denied.

They don't know, they are just speculating based on the movement.
But...this is certainly not a *bad* sign.

I think deep down many of us think it's hard to argue against the SEC's position, if you really look at it from their POV as a government agency.

In a way, it's almost an endorsement of it as a true crypto currency.

Speculation: there is a lot more money in Bitcoin now than there was before the publicitiy of the ETF starting a few weeks/months ago, so much that people started giving a more serious look into bitcoin. This, coupled with a kind of crazy political environment, means more people believe in bitcoin for the LONG term and were just seeing this as a short term opportunity, so the support is higher than expected. So bitcoin has stronger fundamentals than it did a few months ago. Including myself in this.

Yeah this math is bunk. That would mean all investment in bitcoin is purely speculative based on ETF approval.

Could be Google reading your search data/web history if you use Chrome and filling in the blanks.

I am probably a horrible person to answer but I will do my best:
- the ETF would have made it tradeable for the average investor that didn't want the hassle of owning bitcoin directly. hedge funds, retirement accounts, individual portfolios, etc.
- based on their comments, no ETFs are likely to ever get approved in the forseeable future, because it seems like the SEC wants regulation that is fundamentally un-bitcoin at the moment
- I can't speculate much at all on  but it basically means it will continue not being a "mainstream" financial tool for a while, in any traditional sense at least, but it will probably continue growing as it has over the past 3~ years
- No. But maybe increase your stake after you read more about it.

Don't r/bitcoin on cocaine folks

We don't know this, it hasn't been in the mainstream consciousness during a recession yet.

Can't tell if /s or not but "bagholders" is a term for people who are left "holding the bags" after they buy an asset near its high and its price never returns
