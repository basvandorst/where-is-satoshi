Then you're not holding ;)

Cryptos enter your brain man, it's volatile and I was a day trader so staring at book order and graphs was my way of life and impacted me negatively.
Out on a dinner? Still checking blockfolio like every 20 minutes top. In gym? Check blockfolio every rep.
The worst was going sleep without knowing what I'd wake up. And waking up rushing to blockfolio again.
I just couldn't handle it anymore. It affected my sleep cycle to a great extent.
Holding was not a thing for me either, as I thought I had good profit already and I thought the market was, imho, way overpriced. Maybe I was wrong, but to me 500billions of market cap sounded very crazy and the rampant greediness and detachment from reality of so called "investors" was making me more aware of wanting to leave.
Mind you, I still believe the blockchain is a great technology that might change the world, but I see way too much greediness and way too little use.
In the end I made more or less what I make in an year at work, I call myself happy. If I'm making money somebody's losing it, there's no thing like non zero sum profit-losses, I'm glad to be on the winning spectrum, even if I'm not millionaire.

We mined basically almost all the accessible gold there is on this planet. Which is why asteroid mining is getting to be more realistic than gold mining.


What Bitcoin is tho, is only based on consensus, not intrinsic values.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:09:38
So crypto is a self-fulfilling prophecy where its value derives merely from people not selling.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:42:39
Well I always advocated that the market's value was way above what cryptocurrencies were providing to the world (little to nothing beside speculation at the moment). There's little to debate here.
That's some doubts many in crypto had (including Lee or Buterin).
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:49:16
Point is, blockchains aren't unique, and we can have as many blockchains as we want.
We can fork and generate as many as we want, and their value is all based on consensus. Cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value.

What is wrong in his statement about cryptocurrencies not having any intrinsic value?
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:41:24
Was talking about non speculative adoption, such as being able to buy stuff with cryptos on online shops.

What do you mean? I totally understand his point.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:53:31
Gambling and speculation?
Buffet buys business and never sells them.
The man is anything but a gambler and speculator.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:49:07
He made a solid argument behind it.
Bitcoin isn't a business, it doesn't generate nor produce anything, so to his school of thinking, it's a bubble. How can you mathematically value something that doesn't generate money?
Buffet invests mostly in companies with a business. Bitcoin isn't a business. The only reason Bitcoin has a value is because we give it a value.
That's different from a company with tangible assets, liquidity and market.
To add to this, crypto, and especially Bitcoin, adoption has been shrinking from years while value increased steadily.
The alarms for a bubble are all there.
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:47:13
Because we can't create gold, silver and platinum.
They are unique chemical elements with unique properties, and especially platinum and gold are very scarce.
Gold and platinum are seeing increasingly important uses in industry (chemicals, pharma, tech).
On the other side, we can make as many blockchains as we want. Their perceived value is all based on consensus.
But to get more gold on this planet we might have to mine asteroids. No, I'm not joking, just google asteroid mining. In the next decade we're going to mine asteroids for precious metals.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:05:29
I think that's a bullshit argument.
It's not like you guys pretending to get informed have any fuckin clue of the code quality or the math and logic behind this networks.
Not even to mention how many bullshit argument I hear everyday:
"ark is great because it will connect all other blockchains".
Even if it does, who cares? There's atomic swap, automated contracts on Ethereum that already do that, and well, exchanges?
Also, how the hell does an Ark holder benefit from people using the ark network to exchange their ETH for BTC?
Or all the "siacoin is great because it's decentralized". Who fuckin cares it is? Did you even ask yourself if there's even a need for decentralized storage at all? Who is really the client of such a service? What's the difference between decentralizing your files and encrypting them with some sha-512 and put them on motherfuckin free dropbox and similar services?
BAT? You seriously believe people will install and use that browser safe for some bat holder?
You guys fuckin pretend to get informed yet 99% of you, when you speak, seem absolutely detached from reality.
Not even to mention, why would a person buy bitcoins with their dollars to use bitcoins where he already can use its dollars?
So what's the purpose of Bitcoin, really. Also, how does its deflative nature would make it a viable coin? Deflation suppresses spending and promotes hoarding because you know that the amount is fixed.
I used to believe in crypto, but to be honest it's a world totally detached from reality where finding something that really has the possibility to impact everyday life seems more and more difficult.

Like it or not, the man has been steadily making money for the last 60 years and is the richest man on the planet.
All of that while giving away gazzilions of his fortunes.
He isn't the Micheal Jordan of investment, he's the Super Sayian God fusion of all Sayians of investment.
If Buffet says something we should think 1000 times about our preconceived opinions rather than marking him as "old".
Him being old and looking at a business fundamentals is a reason why he's always going up and why he consistently makes money for his investors, year after year. Instead of losing them.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:44:20
This couldn't be further than true, I actually sold like the day before all time high, when bitcoin was above 17k:
I made over 19k of profit in less than 6 months mining around one-two months (between april and june), investing another 250 euros (mostly in NavCoin on changelly when it was below 60k in summer) and doing a shit ton of day trading.
I would've been glad I quit even if Bitcoin was at 40k now, it was wearing down my health. Can't but feel the correction is healthy. 
That being said 500 billions of market cap felt absolutely ridiculous to me due to their close to non existent use outside of speculation and I felt it was a good time to quit.
But mostly I did it for my health and to never watch graphs all days anymore.

What are their benefits to see everything in crypto crash lol?
His Chinese crime syndicate partners control well above 50 % of the hashrate on Bitcoin, what's their benefit to see their returns go down?
Roger Ver said he sold majority of his Bitcoins already few week ago, regardless, he never owned that many to influence the price **that** much.
Dumping all of his Bitcoins would've never caused more than a 2-3k dip.

One that goes against what has worked pretty well, even if not perfectly, till now.
It's not going to happen.
Regardless, people don't give a fuck about those shifts, nor want them. I most certainly don't. They get into Bitcoin because they wanna sell it for higher prices later, not to use them where they can already use their credit card.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:08:48
What do I use bitcoin for if I never sell it then?
Just to see how virtually I'm rich but I'm still in a 2 room house working for 1100 euro a months?
I tried to buy a laptop or a ps4 here in Europe and I had an incredibly hard time doing so, the only shop selling PS4s is in UK, and I don't want to RMA from Italy to UK, that's like 30 euros of shipping at least.
I just don't believe in Bitcoin as a currency anymore.
It's not inflative. Without inflation there's no incentive in spending Bitcoins, there's only incentive in holding them.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:17:12

You buy yourself an ice cream.
Get back to your house after the walk and notice you lost your 47$ change.
You're mad instead of relaxed.

Because they made an **investment**.
They bought an asset that costed X and resold it 10-15-20 god knows how many times more.
This has nothing to do with Bitcoin qualities as a currency, it has only to do with its qualities as an investment, which have proven good till now for the last years.
As a currency, Bitcoin will never scale. It simply promotes hoarding and holding due to its finite nature.
It's a deflationary asset.
That's basic economics.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:59:29
And here's why Bitcoin's an investment, not a currency...
But it's an investment on what exactly...?
It doesn't pay dividends..it's going to be regulated..it's not going to be used (which is true for bitcoin cash too, doesn't solve the problem..).
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:19:10
"Full nodes" do nothing for the network, you know that right?
They only listen, require bandwidth and use bandwidth to send the blocks to other nodes.
But they do nothing per se.Sure they "validate" the input before sending it to miners but...you can send the tx directly to miners regardless..

Of course they would, and why there's no perfect system, the one we live now seems to work pretty well.
We need to tackle inequality, that's true, but that's mostly a matter of taxation and getting rid of lobbies. Since the 80s in the western world inequality is rising and for some reason people keep voting politicians that favor it.

Like it or not, he was pouring money into Bitcoin and promoting it before any of you (us) was.
He deserves more respect than he gets now just because he doesn't feel aligned with how Bitcoin's being developed.
That being said I just can't listen to his non stop Cash promotion.
Yes, it works much better than Bitcoin right now and I wish Core just implemented bigger blocks till LN was released and tested, had to pay 38 $ of fee (a fixed 0.001 from exchange and then I paid another one 0.0015 to make sure it was going to be confirmed in maximum 15 minutes for Bitpay) but he honestly fails to address why couldn't another coin take Bitcoin's role and why did he need to support a fork.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:08:59
You know that Bitcoin Unlimited runs on raspberry pis with 512 MB of ram, right? 
It's not like you put the bigger blocks in your ram, ffs.
Plus, you aren't required to use all of that bandwidth at all.
You can limit the amount of uploads you do, e.g. 8 people.
This means that other 8 nodes can sync with yours.
That requires less than 30 GB of uploads a month.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:57:49


Isn't that a bit too much.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:32:20


The people that control Bitcoin don't want it to scale, plain and simple.
There's absolutely no benefit for miners (which are the only nodes required by the network, listening nodes do nothing but take bandwidth) to increase number of transactions.
The only exception is Jihan, but he isn't that much interested into more transactions rather than not implementing SegWit.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:11:55


So is any Bitcoin fork or pretty much any coin out there.
What makes Bitcoin special? First coin out there, and it's market cap.
It has no value. It has a price.

It's not about not spending, it's about spending less.
If people spend less, goods and services are exchanged way less.

@_date: 2017-12-06 18:34:49
I want to see if LN works first and if we aren't just going to give fees to huge central hubs rather than miners.
Also, I doubt that merchants would ever be interested in offchain unsecure transactions.
When they receive bitcoins, they sell them for cash instantly (or use services that do so for them) so LN is a no go for them.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:50:46
I've seen blockchains in action and I see their pros and cons.
I still haven't seen LN deployed on a huge network.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:46:25
Your problem is that you don't understand where crypto currencies take their strenght from.
It's from game theory and network effect.
Bitcoin is what the majority calls Bitcoin.
If in one year consensus will be to call what we currently call Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core, and another coin (Bitcoin 2k18) Bitcoin that's what is going to happen.
The same things that make Bitcoin strong (game theory, network effect) are what make it weak.
It's a good thing actually.

Man there was a time I believed in cryptos.
Then I saw that all everybody cares is money.
Then I started to understand that the fact that Bitcoin is not inflative will never make it a currency (there's no spending incentive if your money is going to be worth more tomorrow than today).
If people want to keep buying Bitcoins I ain't gonna stop them.

Not really, he said it would take **Ethereum** 3 years to handle Visa-like volumes. And Ethereum's plan is to use DPoS.

How is LN not in sight?
It has been in sight since more than 2 years.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:43:59
It's plain bullshit.
Bigger blocks make small to no difference in network centralization. And the bandwidth and storage needed to accomodate larger blocks is as expensive, atm, like a single Bitcoin transaction.
Go check the hashrate by pools on bitcoin and bitcoin cash, they are nearly identical.
Somebody drinks way too much blockstream kool aid.
Hell, the same people that say BCH is more centralized want LN which is another centralization as few centralized huge nodes will link users (and take routing fees from them ;)).

If somebody feels comfortable selling and he made a nice profit why shouldn't he?
Bitcoin has zero to no utility at the moment, you can hardly spend it anywhere, plus it deflative nature doesn't really encourages spending it.
If somebody wants to sell, let him sell without brainwashing him into holding.

No, but please be aware that in front of (U.S.) law a user of LN is not a "user" but a lender.

There's no tragedy of success.
It's basic math.
There's a fixed amount of Bitcoins.
You know that the Bitcoin you own will be more rare tomorrow than it is today.
You have no incentive to spend it.
Fiat money works great also due to the inflationary nature it has.
You don't know if you want to buy a 40k car, but then you think "heh, it'll cost 41k next year" so you buy it and move the economy.
Nobody buys Bitcoins to use them. People buy Bitcoins to hold them, for fuck sake half of the posts of this subreddit is patting each other for holding.
It's a get rich scheme for each and every one of us safe the few anarcho-libertarians who seriously believe it will disrupt standard financial systems.

@_date: 2017-12-12 03:07:32
Give me a break.
I bought a computer **today** on caseking.de and paid more than 40$ in fees.
Bittrex has 0.001 fee for withdrawals.
Then I had to send to Bitpay and I had to push it in the first available block (because Bitpay gives you 15 minutes) and spent another 0.0015. That's 45$ of fees. On top of that Bitpay gives you a rate which is generally 250$ less than the average of the last hour on gdax. Oh, and Caseking charges you with an additional 2 euros fee for paying in Bitcoins.
Result? I paid around 10% more with Bitcoins than I'd be paid with my credit card. And had to wait for that horrible long time for a block to confirm.
I can just imagine how you buy a pizza, for which fee to get confirmed in human times? (sub 15 minutes).
Happy for you if you like Bitcoin, but facts are facts, and Bitcoin's not money, is an investment.
And no, nobody's going to accept your bitcoins for a house or a pizza, they all accept usd through services like coinbase or bitpay you need to convert to usd first.
Adoption is nowhere and Bitcoin being deflationary will never serve as a currency.
Try to fuckin use it rather than shill.
I'm happy as you if it goes up, I hold much more than your 0.04 bitcoins, but it's a gigantic bubble on the top of no use, I'm just glad I got in this bubble sub 1200$.

Hope that will be the case.
Because I wanted to buy me a PS4 or a laptop for christmas with Bitcoins, and as an European it's close to impossible or I end up paying 15% more at least (due to the limited number of shops and fees). Not even counting I'd need to get it from scan.co.uk, and I don't feel great about RMAing in UK, I'd need to pay like 30-40$ just to send them the item back.
In the end if you want to spend your bitcoins as an european, you sell them.
I wonder what's the fuckin point of Bitcoin (or any crypto) at all if acceptance is only slowing or going backwards year after year.

Thank you, I'll read it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:54:31
I think you're overstretching it, but yes, us consuming as much as possible collectively is what makes us richer.
If I give you 1000 usd for a laptop, you can give 1000 usd to your landlord and have your rent paid, he gives 1000 usd to the jeweler for a nice ring, the jeweler uses these 1000 usd to buy an iPhone for his daughter, the guy who sold the iPhone will buy a nice mountain mike, the seller of the mountain bike will pay you to build him a nice website, and so on..obviously there's taxation in the middle so at each step there's less money, but the government spends that tax money (federal salaries, logistics, defense, etc).
If you don't spend those initial 1'000 usd then you get no laptop, a teen doesn't get her iphone, a mountain bike shop will have no website, somebody won't pay his rent, etc, etc.
That's why Bitcoin turned into an investment but will never see mass adoption.
It's deflative nature makes it a great investment as it hardly depreciates but it makes it a terrible mean of payment as there's only incentive on hoarding more bitcoins, not to spend them.

I doubt there's nowhere near the liquidity to cash even half of his Bitcoins. We're talking about 15+ Billions of USD, Bitcoin markets don't have such a liquidity.
Bitcoin has a 13 Billions volume daily if he started selling even just 1'000 bitcoins per day (so he'd take 3 years to sell them all) Bitcoin price would crash causing plenty of people to panic selling.
Worth in Bitcoin is much different from worth in stocks (which represent a share of a business and revenue).

@_date: 2017-12-28 13:50:19
To be honest I feel much better paying 27% capital gain tax than having crypto gains having a borderline status.
In Italy the legislation about cryptogains is vague if non existent and you actually can't really pay taxes on them but you're also vulnerable to have your account frozen as well.
That forced me into having multiple wire transfers to different accounts to hit sub 5k euros limit as well as spending lots of money on the few shops that accept Bitcoin.
Looking back, I'd rather have had the opportunity to simply pay taxes.
In the end, I have nothing against taxes regardless.

Technically speaking, not a single of those USDs enters the crypto market.


So your logic is that people are intentionally losing millions and millions for which reason exactly? What's Roger's benefit out of all of this? Cash is crashing as much as Bitcoin.
Same for Jihan Wu. The guy has more than 50% of Bitcoin's hashrate regardless (via, btc.com, antpool, gbminers, etc are all linked to Bitmain), what are his benefits to see his income half and Bitcoin tank? He's losing much more money than all of us combined to be honest.
Maybe, and just maybe, some big whales were happy of their profits and started selling, this combined with more law restrictions to go live soon (Russia's one goes live on 28th, Korea's looking to regulate cryptos in early 2018) makes people less willing to wait for neverending growth (nothing grows forever) and panic selling caused this correction.

Not really passive.
If you hold your bitcoins, then you're **actively** diminishing the supply.
It's important to understand that a huge part of Bitcoin's price rising is a self fulfilling prophecy of people buying it expecting it to go up in price.
As long as they hold on their bitcoins supply keeps diminishing.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:42:13
Then why do we care about Bitcoin at all?
Because of the self fulfilling prophecy of the price going up no stop?
Yeah, great job, bitcoin holders hold limiting the supply, so there's less and less bitcoins to buy, which raises the price.
Where is the "value" in Bitcoin? In people holding it.
Sure if somebody told me so I'd call it a Ponzi-like schema.

I hate the FUD term.
Like, if I have a legit concern over something (e.g. the deflative nature of Bitcoin promotes hoarding over spending, making it unfeasible to be a real "currency") then it's automatically FUD to lower prices.
E.g. I've bought a new computer on caseking.de just 5 days ago. If I waited a week for the same amount of Bitcoins I would've got a 1070ti instead of a 1070, and a 512 GB SSD instead of a 256 GB one.
Which makes me less likely to buy anything in Bitcoins for the foreseeable future because I would've had 190 euros more of budget.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:43:00
So what's the point of having BTC if one can't use them?
Holding them forever to see the price go up due to limited supply?

Bitcoin is not an inflative currency. It promotes hoarding, not spending. It's unlikely to ever work as a currency, unless for buying something big.
I bought my computer with Bitcoin on caseking.de, the day after I could've bought an SSD more for the same price I bought it the day before. Every Bitcoin I spent in my life is actually an invite to not spend it.
Ergo, how is it supposed to be a currency rather than an investment?

LN is no solution for merchants as the handful of them that accept bitcoin (and not usds through bitpay) sell them for cash on exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:04:31


Hmm, not really. Can't think of a many people buying bitcoins for that reasons safe for few libertarians. People buy bitcoin for it's return.


That's actually how it works, and it seems to work pretty fine everywhere in the world. Sure, it's not without cons but you can't say it doesn't work.


And that's becoming more of a con than a pro, because it's turning into an investment, rather than a mean to transfer goods.


That's because money is a tool for transfering goods and services. Unless you like staring at pictures of deceased national heroes, it's jut paper. It has no intrinsic value. Money has never been an investment. Saving accounts are not meant to make you wealthier unless the % you get outpaces inflation.
But if money wasn't inflative there would be no incentive for spending and economy would turn into shit.
The fact that you know that the house you want to buy for 400k, may cost you 415k next year is what pushes you to buy it now rather than wait.
If you knew that USD had no more supply you'd know that next year you may buy that house 390k, e.g., which actually makes you not spend your money. And guess what? Economy stops moving.
That's exactly what happens with Bitcoin. People just buy them, hold them, rarely spend them. They have no incentive to spending them at all, because they know that if they buy something with it, Bitcoin's value is going to be probably higher (due to very limited supply) at some point.

LN transaction doesn't move bitcoins, it's basically users lending money between each other while never really moving them.
It's like if I have to give Ralph money and in order to do so, you lend Ralph money and I lend it to you but nobody's really paying nor getting paid.
To make it simple, we all have, e.g., 1 Bitcoin, but cannot spend it really. Meanwhile we give cheques for that 1 Bitcoin around, which is frozen till we close the channel and we lose that Bitcoin to the last person that received it.
Problem is routing.
Since you can be a possible chequeing route between two people, you're de facto responsible for the money (cheque) that passes through you. At least in front of U.S. law.
If, e.g., you have an open channel with an exchange and U.S. government wants to track a transaction and a part of it went through you, you're responsible for it.
I honestly think it's very hard if impossible to enforce this and I don't know how easily can they track those cheques going around so you shouldn't be worried.
I feel like routing fees and scalability of LN are the first thing we need to see working and judge.
But I wonder when it is going on mainnet, LN are in work since like 2015?

Except that those nodes do nothing but maintain a copy of the chain. There are strong arguments toward the theory that nodes that don't mine are more of a burden than an asset to the network since those nodes do nothing per se. They can't validate nor refuse blocks.That's why we have miners. It's miners job to validate blocks and their integrity based on rules.

You can have as many cryptocurrencies as you want, you can fork Bitcoin, you can't fork gold.


The entirety of gold on this planet fits a tennis court.


It's very scarce, we basically mined all of the easily minable gold on this planet.
It's becoming so hard to mine gold that, as I told you, asteroid mining is becoming a more viable solution.


And countless uses in electronics and biochemistry, not just jewelry.


Yes, but gold has an intrinsic value. Bitcoin has not. If everybody agrees that Bitcoin has no value it has no value. The same does not hold true for gold.
You know what's also scarce any cryptocurrency out there. Why would anybody care about Bitcoin more?


It's not about risk. It's about utility. 
I don't see any real use case for Bitcoin, and the situation in 4 years has gotten worse, not better. Bitcoin's price will keep going down as it is. Look at google trends.
There's less people googling bitcoin now than there were 4-5 years ago. And the interest is much lower than it was once.
Bitcoin made early believers rich, some people that invested later wealthier, but guess who made those people richer and wealthier? People that bought their bitcoins in the last years.
Now those people that bought those bitcoins now need to find somebody else to buy them off. And the biggest problem is...that 97% of bitcoins are held by less than 3% of the wallets.
So unless you own plenty of Bitcoins you're unlikely to ever get richer, depending on when did you invest.
As for Bitcoin replacing standard currencies. That would need a change in mentality by Bitcoin holders. But since everybody just cares about money and money this is unlikely to happen.

You're doing nothing but cashing those bitcoin whales out while they keep pushing the mantra of holding, while you sit with your bitcoin wallet waiting for adoption that's not coming or somebody to cash you out.
Good luck mate, but you all should've sold in december instead of greeding.

I mean, there are 3 projects aiming to mine gold on asteroids for how desperate we are for gold. But okay, bitcoin's far better than gold.

Bitcoin was worth nothing back then.
He did made a grade deal after all, exchanging something that had no value for something that had it.
Also, do you really believe he didn't have more Bitcoins?
I know plenty of early adopters (mostly libertarians) that own thousands of Bitcoins.
Even if he spent 10'000, chances are he had much more.
But his historical trade paved the way for the success of Bitcoin.

Plenty of people panic fomod tho.
Half a billion market cap for something that has basically no use but only speculation was a very high price.
I still believe Bitcoin's and other crypto prices are way too high for what these technologies really offer.
There's also an inherent problem with Bitcoin. It's distribution. It's distributed even less equally than fiat currencies. Hell, 97% of Bitcoins are in the hands of just 2.8% portfolios.

I'm starting to think Bitcoin has been a nice brilliant Ponzi scheme executed fantastically by early Bitcoin believers/investors.
We've been buying them out all of the time.
Think about it..Satoshi alone has 1 million bitcoins..There's plenty of people with tens of thousands, the markets are slowly buying them out and we're those buying them.

The problem with the "informed people" here is that they choose to inform themselves to reinforce their ideas (sometimes with sound arguments) but fail miserably to question the very foundations of these ideas.
Like every time I here "Bitcoin's a store of value because it's unique" I just say, well, yes, but if I fork Bitcoin again it's not a store of value just because it's unique.
Uniqueness gives no value to Bitcoin, only demand. Nobody would give a fuck about my shitty ass fork just because it's unique.
In the end there's nothing really giving Bitcoin a value other than the fact somebody's willing to pay you for it.

Silicon based solar panels have their own problems as well and are extremely toxic to produce (purification of silicon is extremely toxic on the environment). 
Not saying that we should stop producing them or we should use coal or other forms of energies, just that it's a two sided coins and it takes a lot of years of a solar panel lifetime to make up for what it consumed in power/electricity just to be made.
Geothermal and wind are much healthier renewables.

So basically Bitcoin is now even more centralized?
Liquid Network is basically a group of (shady) exchanges we should now trust signing transactions.
Wow, what a great fuckin evolution for something that had to be decentralized. Disgusting, keep patting yourselves on your backs, but what Bitcoin looks like in 2018 has nothing to do with what it's purpose was.
The forbes article about Liquid sums it perfectly:


Except that instead of regulated lawful banks we got shady exchanges and blockstream developers. Holy fuckin hell.
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:41:33


Which is why it can't work as a currency.
It's deflationary, promotes holding not spending. 


Only if you're allowed to trade it for cash in the first place, which is already a "nope" in some parts of the world.
Also, considering how volatile it is I'd say there are much better stores of wealth. Gold has 4'000+ years of history as store of wealth and doesn't rely on miners, internet, etc.

Oh yeah man.
Everyday a person wakes up, pays his coffee, bills, buys stuff online, gives money to his daughter for launch and thinks "god, I wish I had done it on a blockchain instead, it would've been much better".
Cryptocurrencies solve a problem nobody cares about, because trust is an asset more than trustless. This while bringing countless of problems more from scaling, to the risk of regulations, bans. From losing all of your money because you lost your PK to being unable to use them. From no shops accepting them (when they do, they accept usd through coinbase or bitpay, they don't care about your bitcoins), from no people even spending them on those shops (most eshops stated their volume in cryptocurrencies was close to irrelevant safe for the first few weeks). Not even to mention the endless scams, inability to withdraw money on exchanges and so on.

But merchants mostly accept USD. It's bitpay or coinbase accepting and selling your bitcoins.
This unavoidably drives the price down.
We need real adoption, stuff and services for crypto, not stuff and services through services that give merchants usd and undersell bitcoin while making you the buyer spend more.
Anyway most shops accepting bitcoins always stated their volumes barely increase the first weeks then they see little to no buys through cryptos.
Nobody in the end buys crypto to use them in places where they could use dollars, that makes no sense.
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:18:50
I didn't sell cause I was smart, I sold because I was stressed.
I literally spent 6 months day trading, and since cryptomarkets don't close, I couldn't do anything but wonder and watch graphs the entire day and night.
I didn't make a life changing amount of money, I could buy a decent car with what I made (but that depends on mine/yours idea of decent).
Believe it or not I aged more in those 6 months of trading and scaping than I did in the previous 5 years. Literally got white facial hair in matter of months, scary.
Maybe I made profits, but it wasn't worth my health.
I also sold because I felt the market cap couldn't grow forever and was probably in a bubble, that's true, but that wasn't the main reason, so don't really want to pass my self as smart. Just had my "enough" moment in the right moment.

There is no thing like "store of value" on a digital currency.
Gold is a store of value as there's a very limited amount of it (you could barely fill a tennis court with it) and it has lots of use (especially in electronics, but also in chemistry and medicine).
Bitcoin's not a store of value. For all we know exchanging bitcoins (or any other crypto, including Cash) could be banned (as it is in China) and at that point there's no way to exchange it back for money.

While cryptos were invented for the opposite reason.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:43:13
I am in no way arguing on why I like Cash more than Core and I'm still stating why in the end I dislike both. Having a legit, imho, concern about the fact that PoW promotes centralization (which is in fact true considering where and who holds the largest parts of hash power) should in fact promote discussions on what can we do or, at least, what are the weak points of my position.
I shared an opinion without busting anybody's balls.
If you can't see the danger from having closed minded and censored discussions on the state of the coins you use (and likely invested) I wonder where we, as crypto community, are heading if not towards censorship and rampant speculation.
Isn't that ironic that we have to fear speaking our mind on a subreddit that promotes concepts like financial freedom and anti censorship?
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:05:44
How so?
It basically proves that acceptance and value are based on consensus.
There isn't such a thing like the "real" bitcoin from ages.

It creates **both** wallets.

No I don't think BCH is a scam but I don't like this war.
I simply wish that Bitcoin was developed better and sooner or later adopted PoS.
It's easy to say that a coin's decentralized when only a handful of people around the world can afford and validate transactions.
To me the 4MB-8MB, Segwit, ecc arguments are all equally weak when I need to invest thousands to be part of the network.
Cash does not answer the problem of being inaccessible to the average Joe.
I won't lie tho., the day I'll see a valid fork of Bitcoin I'm gonna support it all because I don't like what Bitcoin (and basically the entire crypto world) has become: money, money, money. Till one day US bans fiat-to-crypto exchanging (as China did) and all crypto world's gonna suffer from it regardless.
One thing I don't understand tho is why BCH exists in the first place.
Why weren't the changes they proposed accepted into Bitcoin's Core development?
Did they propose them and didn't find consensus or what happened?

They are putting plenty of money, including their very own and buying BCH.
As a BTC holder why does it bother you? You can sell all your BCH right now, and don't pull the card "it's locked on an exchange", we all knew what was going to happen on Aug first and everybody was advised to keep Bitcoins in their wallet.
Don't think that many changes to the Bitcoin protocol were not adopted because they were bad, there were economical interests as well, the same way Jihan Wu probably opposed SegWit not due to ideological but financial reasons (Bitmain would've lost it's advantage over the competition as SegWit is not compatible with their (stolen) patent).
You people need to realize that both sides are heavily influenced by  economical reasons. If we have small blocks on Bitcoin it's because there's plenty of developers and influencers that have economical reasons to keep high fees and profit out of them.
And I don't want to argue that block size or segwit or whatever choice is better or worse but both sides have more financial than ideological reasons to support one of the two sides.
People on would flame and downvote me if I say that SegWit ain't that bad and Jihan opposes it due to his miners, same way as anything against bitcoin is held against me here.

Aren't Bitcoin's upgrades based on consensus?
Yes, I do find BCH, at the moment, better, that doesn't mean that I'd still like Bitcoin to work better. I am worried about BCH as well. What will happen when community will want to drive BCH's evolution towards a different path than the one that benefits Jihan Wu?
I am equally skeptical of both coins and the more I see this situation the more it feels to me like Bitcoin's gonna fall. Which I sincerely like not to happen as I have good part of my savings in Bitcoin.
Yes, I do believe that increasing blocksize is the way to go for broader adoption and it absolutely fixes the needs we have **now**.
In my own view at some point Bitcoin needs to get rid of PoW and adopt some other system, but that needs to happen without adding off chain layers. Till PoW is a thing we'll always be dependent on miners greed.
There's a saying in software engineering world: there's no ideal solution as problems change with time. Increasing blocksize now to fix problems **now** is the main concern. Plus, increasing blocksize would kill BCH instantly. Only Jihan Wu would keep supporting it due to its miners that have no advantage with SegWit. If in 24 months we have a **working** technology the community has consensus around so be it, we can still decrease block size or make it adaptable to current volume of transactions.

It's a bit different with stocks tho:
a) the fact that a company doesn't pay a dividend now doesn't imply it won't tomorrow. It's not really relevant if it does, google pays no dividend and invests everything.

*The point of any store of value is risk management due to a stable demand for the underlying asset*
Demand for Bitcoin is anything but stable nor predictable and can easily change due to regulations. Bitcoin is not a store of value but a digital asset that, so far, has been in increasing demand. But that can change at any minute.


Neither is the opposite.

You realize Satoshi himself promoted increasing blocksize?
As well as many other Core developers before they were hired by Blockstream.
LN, SegWit, sidechains are all compromises on security as well as promoting centralization (who's gonna put the liquidity on LN?). Only people that already own certain amounts can be part of those sidechains.
Now let the downvotes fall, yet, increasing blocksize has always been the original idea.
Bitcoin doesn't work how it was conceived to work, and all the fixes are far.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:28:59
And it isn't a "store of wealth" neither. It's demand can disappear any day legislators decide to ban it or markets decide that it's way underdeveloped to compare with other coins. The only "weak" defense we may have are decentralized exchanges, and there's not one I find even barely decent, not a single one I'd trust a bank transfer to buy crypto currencies.
It's living on hype, but it needs much better development if it wants to survive in the long run.
Anybody over investing on Bitcoin is in for troubles. Chinese know.

I feel like both communities feel threatened by the other one.
Bitcoin Cash might work as a better alternative for payments and Core supporters feel like this could damage what they now see as a store of value in Bitcoin.
But then Bitcoin Cash cannot really be a payment method if there aren't people accepting it in the first place.
People say this is bad for both Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, I personally believe that it's actually a very interesting moment that can benefit both communities, even if one may die (more likely to happen to Bitcoin Cash).
I also have another question, why there are no proposals on swapping bitcoin to PoS?
I fear like if a PoS Bitcoin movement would get traction it would be killed by all the people feeling it as a threat to Bitcoin's fiat value, regardless of the technological (and decentralization) implications it might have.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:23:09


Problem is that there are **less** shops accepting Bitcoin now, than in 2015. And that's because of fees and long confirmation times.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:26:46
How's that an attack and why people would need to be worried?
If Bitcoin Cash is a scam and Core is better the markets are gonna kill it regardless.
If a guy wants to buy Bitcoin Cash with his Bitcoins I think it's a free market.
It's not like whales and institutions don't manipulate BTC's price regardless.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:57:28
I really miss your point.
If somebody's investing money onto something and doesn't invest even a bit of his time to understand what he's buying he kind of deserves, and is doomed regardless, on making bad decisions.

Believe it or not, most early adopters did not come into Bitcoin to profit and vegeta memes but because they believed in a better world and in a coin that could free people. Some of them hold to this day thousands and thousands of bitcoins.
The richest wallets (outside of exchanges and some famous names) belong to such people.
I know few bitcointalk moderators that have thousands of Bitcoins and have never, ever, sold one, or worst case scenario few.
I can most certainly say that they do not like a bit the current cryptomarkets situation.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:42:48
I don't find Bitcoin perfect at, it's slow, relies on a handful of people validating transactions and expensive equipment, tx fees are absurd and requires a shit ton of electricity.
The reason why it's over 6k is because there's huge hype around cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin at the moment is the main gateway to crypto world.
I personally believe that Bitcoin needs a shit ton of development.
Nobody in the crypto world believes that Bitcoin is a medium of payment from a long time and now we all use the "store of value" as you could store value in a digital asset that could be banned any day making impossible to exchange it for fiat.
I'm not advocating for BCH here, it has the very same problems even if it fixed for now tx problems.
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:50:36
Also, who holds the bitcoins? Where? How? Where do they buy them? What about possible regulations?
Of course a bank should tell you to not invest in bitcoins at their bank.

Look, a blockchain is a giant p2p database. There ain't no real technical solutions to solve the scaling without increasing the database size.
Those are the cons of increasing block size:
-makes running a node harder, but to be honest I'd argue this is a real problem as people make it to be. Nodes that don't mine are a burden on the network as they only request data without ever sending valid blocks. So the argument for not increasing block size is weak from a "centralization" point of view.
-bigger blocks: more bandwidth needed.
Those are the pros of increasing block size:
-lower confirmation times
-more transactions per block
Imho both the BCH and BTC community are more interested in making money than creating valid p2p technology which in the very end may not make any money.

Well, Bitcoin, and every crypto, needs to move to some sort of consensus that doesn't require tons of energy and hardware.
Not only the current system basically centralizes the network in the hands of very few people (hell, almost 90% of bitcoin mining is in the hands of 5 people), and keeps pushing out anybody who has not the liquidity and access to low cost energy, but it's also a system that is easy to attack by governments that want these operations to shut down.
Bitcoin needs to find another route for its consensus.
**edit**: fine, keep your "decentralized" coin in the hands of a handful of chinese "mining moguls".

I've always stated that no crypto can work as a currency if it's deflationary and needs a PoW network behind it.
Deflationary nature kills spending and promotes hoarding -&gt; no real use case. Be real, how many of you have used bitcoin to buy stuff? I did, but only because I lacked fiat to buy me a new pc on caseking.de. Otherwise it would've been simply easier to use my credit card.
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:51:35
Man, I criticize bitcoin and cryptocurrencies often for many reasons. *that being said* you know jackshit about what the future will bring for cryptocurrencies. You can be sure that if prices recover a new fomo mania might spread again.
Personally I'll invest in cryptos again when I'll see some real use case and a coin I like (no proof of work and inflative by nature).
That being said people saying hodl are merely spreading their own investment choices, and hoping that more people don't crash the price more. That I agree with.
But you simply don't know if btc will 5x in the next 6 months.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:51:26
So you agree with me. Network effect and consensus are the only thing that make Bitcoin different than other coins. That's exactly what your two links say.
It has no value. The onlyt thing giving it a value is the fact that some people want it. Which means it has a price, not intrinsic value. The consensus can disappear, so can disappear the network effect.
When something has intrinsic value, it has intrinsic value regardless of what other people think about it. A rocket has intrinsic value as it brings you into space, regardless of what people want to pay for it.
Bitcoin, Dollars, Yens, Ethereums have no value, they have consensus around the fact that somebody tomorrow will want it.

What was false in what Buffet said?
He stated cryptos aren't an investment, they are speculation.
An investment requires the asset to generate money and have a cash flow. He doesn't consider gold an investment as it doesn't generate money (you are *speculating* its price will go up) how can he consider cryptocurrencies an investment?
And gold has 5000 years of story as a solid investment and real case use and constant demand, and limited supply.

I never said I believe it will go up X times. Just because something is deflationary doesn't mean there will be somebody wanting it in the future.

Bitcoin doesn't have value, it has a price.
Every thing you listed is also true for hundreds of coins out there. I can go on github grab the code of some coin and release my own coin transferrale over long distances with ease, make if unforgeable and make its supply limited.
That doesn't mean somebody will care, nor that it has value because it has those unique properties.
The only thing that will distinguish bitcoin and ep1939's shitcoin is consensus.
My coin would have no consensus. You're betting about consensus around bitcoin and that people will keep converging on the same conclusions about your favorite coin.
But there's absolutely nothing about bitcoin that makes it intrinsically valuable. Nothing. Bitcoin's code is open source, I have tomorrow another coin, maybe even better technologically with the same or better properties, doesn't mean it's worth a single cent. I can't fork or create new gold. I can release and fork how many cryptos I want.
Doesn't mean people will care or want it or use it.
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:44:21
Oh yeah, all those conspirators who can't wait to buy bitcoin at the next dip, yet they never do and price goes lower and lower.
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:01:18


Again, not different than any fork or many other technologically better coins.
Only consensus makes it different.
You just can't win that argument with me, plus I was writing about all of these stuff and writing articles for a long time. 
Currencies have no intrinsic value, end of story.
Money is not wealth, it's a medium to acquire it. Bitcoin has zero value, same as the US dollar.
You're free to believe it's different, but for every immutable, etc, bullshit you'll throw at me I'll simply tell you "okay, so I create a fork and I have another coin with the same properties" and the only thing that you'll have left will be "yeah, but nobody cares about your coin" thus confirming in an endless loop that consensus and network effect are what gives Bitcoin a price.
But it has no use, no value. A rocket does, a cow does, a bottle has value, everything I can use has a value, Bitcoin requires some other person to give it a value so it has one.
It's only the consensus giving them any value.
There's consensus around bitcoin, now, you don't know if there will be next year or in a decade, etc.

Spending bitcoin is an edge case. Due to the deflationary nature of Bitcoin it doesn't promote spending. 
If you believe it will replace or company fiat why spend it? If you're in to make money why spend it?
So who and why would spend Bitcoin?
a) early adopters that have a shitton but not enough fiat. I personally know few people with thousands of bitcoins but they don't cash out. When they need bigger stuff (elettronics and upwards) they seldom use bitcoin. Because 0.12 bitcoins for a brand new smartphone are nothing to their btc wallet but 500 euros are one forth of their salary. 
b) people that had good gains and want to cash out but want to avoid moving too much fiat through banks for whatever reason. That was my case last year. Wanted a new pc bought it in bitcoins as buying a 2500$ pc in bitcoins would ve caused less issues than cashing out the same amount.

Why would people mass adopt bitcoin?
Bitcoin cannot work as a currency. It's deflationary, it promotes only hoarding. Not spending.
The only reason to buy bitcoin is because you believe it's price is going to be x times what you paid it for.
Otherwise, there's no reason to buy a house for 100 bitcoins if you think it's gonna cost 95 bitcoins next year, because everybody wants it and the supply is limited.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:59:33
Again, here lies the problem.
**Who fuckin cares about the (fiat) price**.
It's us who should give a value to our coins, use and trade them. Regardless of their fiat value.
There might be the possibility of bans, regulations, more price fluctuations, in fact this is the very nature of such an asset, and that's why the only way to fight it is to use the coin in the first place.
I know it's hard, very fuckin hard. But that's how disruption and utility will grow.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:41:19


But that's simply not true.
Otherwise everyone everywhere would be making debts and living on credit, which is something that doesn't happen.
If I can't buy something I don't buy it, I have no intentions of buying it to my debt limit and then pay the debt's interests. That's what makes banks richer and me poorer.


That's the same rating agency that valued well subprime mortgages before the apocalypse and had Lehman with A status before it crashed.
Italy is a rich and productive country and it's one of the countries with the highest household savings in the world.
Most people I know, the median italian, has plenty of money saved in banks, and is rather risk adverse. Not the biggest economy booster, but extremely stable.
Early 2000's we had the highest saving rating in the world.
Economy went worse after and we never really recovered, plenty of people got shaken, but most did not.
Between me and my gf, in our late 20s/early 30s, we have plenty of money saved and **zero debt**. And that's also because both our parents couples were savers and hold hundreds of thousands of euros.
We're financially super safe (unless those banks default, but we're insured for up to 100k for each bank account) and can afford to buy estates cash (we're planning to buy a nice flat in center of Rome cash in the next 5 years). Why would we make debt?
What you say applies to your logic and other people, not everyone.
We have a culture of saving and most people I know save decent amounts of their salary, they certainly do not make debt.
Of course people that did not have parents with a similar culture are gonna stay financially unstable.
Their parents didn't save, didn't bought them a flat or house, they need to buy a car to work (debt), they buy stuff they can't afford right now (debt), etc. And they are gonna stay poor and likely so will their kids.
I do understand some other people and economies work differently, that's also why Italy doesn't grow as other countries: we don't spend money as other people we boost the economy much less.


That's not really how it works. We're paying debts made in the past, often decades ago. I am all for austerity but now we got a crazy government that wants to go for a spending spree, and guess what, that's why our interests have rosen and our debt is getting heavier.


That's your opinion. Without inflation people spend less. That's a simple fact. You need some healthy inflation or simply people would be less prone to spending and taking credit and moving the economy.
I'm perfectly fine as it works, I wish my government wasn't made of a bunch of populists promising that if we spend more and make more debt we'll grow enough to repay that debt. That's not how it works.
Money per se has absolutely no value per se. I repeat, any currency has absolutely no intrinsic value per se.
Unless you like staring at images of dead national heros on a banknote they are absolutely worth nothing.
Somebody waking up from a coma with hundreds of millions of french francs ha just paper and nothing else.
This is true for any currency, including bitcoin.
The only thing that gives currencies a value is the fact that you know tomorrow people will want it. That's what makes you chase money. But currencies are worth nothing if nobody wants them for whatever reason.
That being said, if you want a store of value you buy something that has a value. Gold, jewelry, stocks of companies, estates, whatever. Something real that has a value. Currencies are absolutely worthless by themselves.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:38:02
When you need regulators to save a cryptocurrency, it's pretty obvious that nobody gives a fuck about using the cryptocurrency for what it was supposed to do (to be unbannable and incontrollable).
All of your posts make me so glad I quit cryptocurrencies months ago, you want nothing but get richer, to you it's mere speculation.
"Save Bitcoin", as we fuckin need somebody's permission to trade with Bitcoins. No we don't, that was the very purpose of Satoshi. What we *may* need is the permission to trade them for fiat currencies.
But if we need cryptos to trade for fiat currencies, then cryptos have absolutely no fuckin use rather than speculation.
I wish you all to make money, but it's blatant to me that cryptocurrencies are an immense failure, nobody's using them to trade items and services, 99 % of you (us) only care about the price they bought, and they price they (may) sell.

Holy shit, so much this.
I'm starting to feel like crypto investors (mostly people that got into cryptos due to mining in the last 12 months) are so much into prices and returns that they are absolutely the worst people to listen about cryptos.
Lousy, ignorant (meaning some of them don't even understand exactly what a blockchain is, I'm serious), annoying.
Reading bitcointalk today's pure shit. Everywhere you go it's all "money, money, money" and "omg this coin's so good, buy before too late, this is going to moon".
Yes I invested in cryptos as well, I trade everyday, but holy fuckin hell, no I'm not sure we're going to replace money with a blockchain, and even less I believe in a world where governments and banks do not avoid tracking our money.
I see the fascination, I do believe some coin's might spread their use around the internet, I do believe that the blockchain technology will have a huge spread with the IoT but at the end of the day, even as an investor, what I care of is to see a world's that more just (which is what the original idea was).
I do know two people (one of them's a moderator on bitcointalk) that I know they mined **thousands** of bitcoins in 2009-2010 when everybody was mocking them for chasing monopoly money.
They were here mining thousands of litecoins later, ethereum, investing and buying.
They are among the richest people on this planet, they ain't billionaires but they have more than enough money to retire on a private island with the Brazzers cuties shoving their cocks in the back of their throats 24/7.
But in fact what they do, what they really care about is actually spreading the utility behind blockchain technologies. They ain't those scamming you (and trust me, they could given their high reputation in the bitcoin community), they ain't those tracking bitcoin's price 24 7, no they are those who truly believe in the social justice that cryptocurrencies could bring.
They are anarchists to their bones, and they really care about stuff like freedom and not being controlled by the governments.
You described it perfectly when you say it stink of used cars salesmen.
In the end, who cares so much about how much he can sell his bitcoin for, wants dollars, not bitcoins.

There are other reasons why Bitcoin can't work as a currency other than transaction time or fees.
@_date: 2018-07-11 12:26:00
First, how naive you need to be to think that there's any democracy in bitcoin?
Censored subreddits, boards, pushed narratives and deception showed with the Bitcoin Cash fiasco and many others how consensus isn't a good thing per se.
The beauty of central banks is that while they are appointed by governments who are elected by people they are still responsible and liable for their actions in court.
Also, till now, most central banks for anybody reading here (unless he's venezuelan or something) have done pretty much no damage but offered a stable and reliable solution of payments.
Second: this is really levels. 
Third: I'll explain it to you very easily. You have 20k. You want a car that costs 20k. Since there's always a bit of inflation you know that this car will cost you probably 20'300 next year. So it makes no sense to not spend the money now and wait an year. You would not have a car for an year and have to acquire another 300 in the next 12 months. Thus you spend the money now, you acquire the car, the car salesman can now pay his daughter's scholarship, the school can now renovate two classrooms, and so on. In a deflative world this would not happen.
If you have 20k now and know that next year you'd pay less than that for that car you're actually have a reason to wait. Thus the salesman can't pay his daughter's scholarship, thus the school can't renovate two classrooms and so on.
Deflative currencies cannot be currencies. Bitcoin cannot work as the currency of the future, not just from technological but conceptual problems it has. It promotes hoarding and holding not spending, and it's used as an investment by whoever buys them, not to spend them.
Why would I buy Bitcoin to use them in places I can only pay with cash?
You make the quite irrelevant and niche example of the lost village where you need to transfer money, are you delusional or something?
I agree the costs are a huge chunk but what is the laos villager going to do with his 0.005 bitcoins? Just exchanging them for his local currency might be a huge problem and he'll end up paying more fees anyway. Bitcoin does not solve this problem.
An international transfer nowadays take around 48 hours. And the money is fast and easy to use. It will get even lower and easier with time.


If you haven't noticed more governments are outlawing cryptocurrencies than any form of cash. So cryptocurrencies are in fact the worst investment you can do and the worst payment you can do if in the next 2 months your government wakes up and decides you can't trade cryptos for fiat.
We currently have a system that works, well, and is pumping world economy as it never did. It has its cons, but no cryptocurrency solve any of those while bringing countless of problems.


You must be american, because we in Europe hardly finance the stuff we buy (unless a car or a mortgage). We save for stuff to buy. This might make us weaker investors and makes our economies slower to recover from financial problems because people tend to spend less money and save more, but we're also much stronger against the very same financial problems because generally we save more and make much less debt.

Looking at that graph, why do people assume that cryptomarkets are in depression phase and not in the complacency one?
I could start drawing plenty of graphs showing fitting the fact that crypto markets are in complacency phase.
In fact 90% of crypto enthusiasts repeat the complacency mantra, not the depression one.

Can't really see how this paints Bitcoin positively, it sounds very populist too.
First line: created by computers, doesn't explain how's that a good thing. Issued by governments, actually since you vote for your government it's a very democratic system. I don't see how **you** decide or really impact Bitcoin.
Second line: Again, you don't really point out how decentralization is better.
Thid line: this might be the worst. Inflation is very needed by any currency to promote spending. Limited supply pushes hoarding and hold mentality, not any real use. That's why there's this retoric of bitcoin being digital gold.
4th: any person needing it, very well knows that cash can be transmitted in plenty of easy way, with or without a computer, with or without connection, you can give it to your daughter for a meal, or use your phone to pay at the supermarket, still in cash, veyr fast. Anybody reading the last 2 points very well knows that if anything fiat has advantages over bitcoin.

**Who fuckin cares about the price**.
We should work to "replace the old system". Not use cryptocurrencies to get rich in this old system by holding something we don't use.
The only way for cryptocurrencies to win is to use them regardless of the possibility of selling/buying them for fiat.

Who cares.
If people can't do very basic research it's their problem.
I don't see the scam anyway.
It's a decentralized world rules by consensus. If somebody wants to consider Bitcoin Cash the "real" chain, it's their business/problem, the market will ignore it.
Bitcoin.com is owned by Roger Ver and he's free to call coins what he wants, and we're free to ignore him.
Nothing to do/see about it.
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:06:15
Man, I believe in freedom of expression and consensus.
He's free to say anything he wants unless it's illegal. As far as I know Bitcoin isn't trademarked nor could it be. Who's gonna sue a fork or website?
If he wants to claim Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin, so be it.
If he wants to claim he's Satoshi, so be it.
He'll get judged for what he says, how he says and how he supports and motivates his opinions, which is the most important thing.
A decentralized and "free" world also comes with people saying and doing anything, that's good, that leads to debates, discussions.
In the end the market and consensus decide who's right or wrong.
Let's say, hypothetically, that Bitcoin Core's developers, 3-4 key mining pools and the moderation of important subreddit/websites will conspire to do something that the community won't like, we'll be able to fork the coin without them and the consensus and the markets will decide which one is the real bitcoin.
We can't pursue censorship in a decentralized world, because then it's not decentralized. It's yet another world where who's at the bottom is controlled by who's at the top.
I don't like Bitcoin.com calling Cash Bitcoin too. You know what I do? I don't support it nor recommend it if asked.
But I don't feel this urgency to keep this pointless war against forks and people with different opinions/actions than mine.
They get defeated by markets and consensus if that's their destiny anyway.

I have never once told you to not say anything in 2 posts, you're a bit paranoid.

I simply find those wars pointless. We can't change what Bitcoin.com calls as Bitcoin, there's no legal basis for it.
Let them do their stuff and ignore them, if you don't agree with them it's the best way to defeat them.

I'm not arguing against or for this law in any way.
The point I'm making is that it wasn't 'stolen'. US needed to pump the economy and ease the USD which was hard to do since for every dollar printed the federal reserve needed to back it up with gold.
So to make people spend more the law forced people to sell their gold for dollars thus increasing US gold reserves and pumping the economy.
In the end this executive order, among other things, did achieve in both the goals, so history can judge the order negatively by a moral point, but not from an economical one.

How's free speech a bad thing tho?
This subreddit is absurdly censored.
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:37:53
I know this is but I need to say what I feel, even if I feel this won't be popular.
A currency cannot have 0 inflation or deflation.
Bitcoin's sort of deflative by nature, which is not a good thing for a currency.
Let me put it in a perspective.
You have 500'000 $. You know your 500'000 $ will be worth less in two years.
Let's say that you're looking for a flat. There's a nice flat near your area that costs 500'000 $.
You can make two choices:
-a) buy it
-b) wait
Now, the b) scenario with an inflative currency is not wise (unless you invest it and have a return that beats inflation). As inflation will make your dollars worth less with time (and the same flat may cost 525'000 or be unavailable in two years) you're pressured to spend your 500'000$ now and get that flat.
The inflative nature of pretty much any currency is good for economy. In the end currencies are only a mean to trade goods and services. Knowing your money is worth less tomorrow makes you spend your money now and moves the economy. You'll get your flat. Who sold you the flat will maybe get a rare Ferrari, idk. The Ferrari owner may start a business.
Now, all of these things are way less likely to happen with a deflative currency.
As you know that your 500'000 might be worth more in two years you're invited to hoard it and wait, not to spend it. In two years the same flat may cost you 480'000 $ and you'd save 20'000$. But what happens in two years? That if you wait another two years you may pay for the same flat 455'000$.
This leads to you not spending your 500'000, the home owner won't get his Ferrari, the Ferrari owner won't have the cash to start the business.
Obviously the inflative nature of a currency has a bad side: if you're a saver and you don't want to spend your money you're gonna face the problem of your savings devaluing with time. You're pressured to either spend it or invest it. But investments not always turn well. So your savings may devalue even more.
Here a deflative currency shows its benefits: you know your currency won't be worth less tomorrow and you can sleep just fine.
But again a deflative currency won't really work as a currency. People are not encouraged to invest it, spend it. It cannot move an economy.
That's one of the problems I see in most cryptocurrencies. While I do understand the philosophy some of you have of a store of value is right, it also leads to: "how can Bitcoin really function as a currency if hoarding and holding is promoted rather than spending"?
Shops that implemented Bitcoin payments did not see a real spike in sells except for the very few weeks from the news.
Because each and everybody is concerned with the fiat value and promotes a holding philosophy.
Yet, even without those memes and philosophy pretty much anybody can understand that the limited amount of Bitcoin does not promote spending it.
I think Satoshi was a great mathematician, yet I don't think he was a great economist. He couldn't be everything, and this subreddit has moved past his ideas for many things (block size, e.g.).
In the end I think that if Bitcoin had an acceptable inflative nature (2%/year) and a PoS (so holders and spenders can both have benefits) system instead of a PoW system Bitcoin's economics would've looked better.
I just can't see Bitcoin making a case for being a currency at any point. It's always gonna be a second layer of currency transmissions. I know some people argue that "you will use Bitcoin for big payments", but in the end, why would I, and why would the seller accept it if he's less likely to make many smaller payments?
At some point, as a community, we really do need to rethink the fundamentals of Bitcoin.
What I feel (or better, know) will happen tho, is yet more phylosophical wars that will lead to nothing.
In the end Network's stability derives from consensus, and it's pretty obvious we cannot reach consensus without yet other forks.
And since most people are concerned with Bitcoin-fiat price rather than using Bitcoins the same thing that keeps Bitcoin price high (it's store of value-ish nature) is the same thing that will prevent it from achieving anything (it's deflative nature).

You're being paranoid and way over involved emotionally in this.
I'm not telling you to shut up.
In fact I welcome you to say what you think it's the best for the community and the crypto world.
I'm merely pointing out that constantly talking about another coin as a rival, even tho you call it a scam or motivate your posts, does nothing but promote it as an alternative.
I sincerely believe that ignoring BCH's existence is the best way to not legitimize it.
But if you feel otherwise I welcome you to act accordingly.
Yet, today again there are more lines about Bitcoin Cash on the net. Yet, today, bitcoin.com is going to have much more views than .org.
If you feel like spreading the flame and war gives Bitcoin any benefit, so be it.
To me it does nothing but create more fractures inside the community, it does nothing but create a bad climate.
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:01:46


But that's exactly what happened?
Bitcoin Cash isn't considered by anybody as Bitcoin, not even Bitcoin Cash supporters call it Bitcoin.
Bitcoin Cash tried to fork and get consensus majority about it being the real Bitcoin, it failed to do so, community and markets rejected the idea.
So we did self-police after all.
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:51:49


Well, so does Bitcoin "core"?
That's the beauty of consensus, who gives a fuck about that?
Most people decided that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core is simply Bitcoin or the "real" chain, so the consensus decided which one is Bitcoin. I would argue how that consensus was achieved, but this is beyond pointless, because it was achieved and Bitcoin is Bitcoin, no matter what Bitcoin Cash supporters claim.
If they consider Bitcoin Cash the real Bitcoin, who cares? 
In the end this doesn't matter at all, and don't bring pointless arguments such as "scam", there's no scam going on, or "but new investors will get confused". It's their problem, they are using their money without making very basic research, and there's nothing we can do about it nor we should.

Sure, but then a lie becomes an argument.
I've seen enough bch vs btc discussions to come to the conclusion that all of this discussion is beyond pointless. Both communities suck dick honestly from many point of views.
If anything, bch supporters need it more to legitimize their coin.
There is no real debate anymore since first of days of august about which coin is Bitcoin.
The only ones opening it are bch supporters, and they want to give the impression that there's an argument going on, an argument that has been settled nearly 9 months ago by the markets already.
Both communities would get better if they focused on making their coin and community as good as possible, but since money, propaganda and censorship are rampant we find ourselves in this endless stream of pointless discussions.

It's obvious Ver made a bet that isn't paying out the way he thought. He has many good points about this subreddit and bitcoin itself, mind it, but at this point it's blatant he's more interested in keeping this apparent "war" real to give bch a spotlight.

I had a friend of mine making a huge amount of doges and selling them for bitcoins, from what I recall he told me back then that he made some hundreds doge in few months. He's still sitting on them and he had previously solo mined more than a thousand bitcoins.
He's also a moderator on bitcointalk, one of the most important and he won't tell you (rightfully) how many bitcoins he has, but if he's sitting on what he said he made till 2011-2012 he's a multi millionaire.

Plus 15$ of Bitcoin fees, 2% of Bitcoin extra tax, and I don't remember how much to take out my money out of the exchange in the first place.

Considering most if not all crypto values are tied to BC we may see some BC dump, thus raising the value of cryptos compared to BC (meaning, you could see ETH at 0.2 instead of current 0.9ish) but that doesn't mean an increased value compared to fiat.

He thinks I know nothing about crypto (I never ever told in the past I traded in them) but since he told me that, tron has lost like 70%+ value.
He hasn't mentioned cryptos in a very long time at this point, six months, I'm waiting for the 90% drop to taunt him again.

Gold is very needed in elettronics and jewellery and biomedics. Has 5000 years of history as an investment. And you cannot fork it. Your turn.

Indeed, I remember using lycos, irc and icq in 2001 and playing Counter-Strike online.
The first boom of internet came with ADSL but it's smartphones that made internet truly global.

I sold at beginning of december 2017 tho. I'd say it was a good idea.

stocks didn't drop 90% in value in the last 12 months, and they still generate profits.
very bad comparison.

3270 yesterday.
Probably sub 3000 by the end of next week.
I wonder what the people crying for the price dunking will do when in few days it's gonna be lower. Just sell and find your entry point if you belive in bitcoin. Don't fuckin hold a falling knife.

Everybody but memers and people willing to dump their bags on you at the best possible price were saying those market caps were ridiculous.
Please  understand that the people that keep repeating the hold stuff ain't doing that to give you sound financial advice but their pushing their own interests.

All of those are businesses with a assets, debts and cash flow.
You can most definitely give their stocks a value. That's the whole point of Buffet's value investing: ignore hype, look at the numbers, decide what price is right and if the stock is overvalued or undervalued.

I'm a solar researcher, the sole idea of wasting so much energy and claiming it's accelerating the growth of renewable energy is beyond stupid. It's getting our planet much hotter, everyday.

Once somebody understands it...What he's actually supposed to do...?

Doesn't matter, just invest all you have in Bitcoin.

Currencies aren't stores of value. That applies to Bitcoin as well.
If you want to invest...just invest. Holding currencies isn't a mean of acquiring wealth, no rich person on this planet has much fiat, 99.9% of their value comes from assets, stocks, options, obligations, etc.
