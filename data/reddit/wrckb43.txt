Blame the party system entirely

I agree, fuck the government for stealing my money that I took the risk to earn. But also you should probably just pay your taxes.

The bitcoins

There’s plenty of people who bought in the 18-19k region. You’re fine, I’ll give it a week until you’re back in the green :)

If you need the money, sell. If not hold you might be surprised a few months down the line. Also, don’t buy what you can’t afford to lose.

If you plan on buying or selling within those 6 hours then yes. If not then it doesn’t matter if you leave your coins in or not.

I would say coinbase. They make it very easy to buy and sell and they aren’t going away anytime soon. Just have to deal with high fees and long transaction times. Also store your coins somewhere safe.

More like 1.5-2 for an old Veyron

I held off on buying bitcoin when it hit an all time high of around $800 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:18:40
I’m confident that bitcoin will recover. I might sound like an idiot a week from now but who knows
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:16:15
Pump and dumps in this case is when you hold a bunch of bch at a low price and pretty much hype up the coin and get people to buy more. Demand is higher for the coin and since you held the coin when it was cheaper you profit when you sell it all. They traditionally crash hard and that’s the point. A quick buck. Sustainability really depends on whether or not this really is a pump and dump and not just the masses leaving bitcoin. We will see within the next week or so for sure. This is of course coming from a very basic understanding of the concept.

I really think this is the future. Whether you like it or not it will become the new benchmark. 0-60 in 1.9 seconds 8.8 second quarter mile and 250+ mph all while seating 4. For $200,000. Now that’s impressive. Honestly what’s not to love?

You used coinbase? If you bought btc you bought the right one.

BCH is already gaining again. Big dump is coming though. Hodl

If you hold one bitcoin the price would have to increase 35x to be able to afford the cheapest new Lamborghini. The price of a huracan is right around 200-250k

My bad, I’m on mobile and when I wrote that I was the first comment.
