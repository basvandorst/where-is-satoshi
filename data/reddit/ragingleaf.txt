It is scary at first.  
**Remember, always double check addresses you're sending/requesting too.   Always back up your seed words.  They are basically your wallet.**

fuck that.

I hang out in bitcoin channels. 
The biggest issues I routinely see:
* People fail to backup their wallets.
* People accidentally send to an old wallet they deleted.
* People forget their passwords.
IF IT'S NOT BACKED UP IN 2 OTHER LOCATIONS, ITS NOT BACKED UP.
Encryption is a good idea too.

Programmer/developer here.
If it's android, I can probably guide you through recovering files, as long as it turns on.

I'm not familiar with case.  I'd be concerned that one of the multisignature keys could be lost or made unavailable, and you'd be out of luck.
I personally just encrypt seed words, and store the encrypted text file in multiple places.
The problem is I could forget a password.  So I'm examining cryptosteel and similar ideas.

Did you listen to what he said?  Did you watch the video?
* "Bitcoin which is,  there's nothing in the end, it's purely self fulfilling prophecy"
**Bitcoin is backed by encryption, and a shared ledger across the internet.**
* "It's a technically sweet solution to a problem, but not one that has any economic relevance, certainly not a reason to hold the currency."
**Taking control away from banks/governments isn't economically relevant? What?**
* "There's a lot of libertarian ideology.
**So republicans should be against it?  Just political charging.**
* "That's the system we already have"
**Outright lie.**
* "It consists on nothing but ones and zeroes"
He's wrong on every part, and he obviously doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.  A PHD doesn't mean he knows all, it means he studied one specific subject, and obviously this is outside his area of expertise.

So, a collection of banks controls all USD on earth, and you're surprised they wind up with all the money?
Are you serious?

Delusional how?
Listen to him talk.  He doesn't even understand how it works.
Bitcoin really isn't even that difficult to understand.  It's really not.

It's cryptographic-ally backed by the fact that is a DEAD SET LIMIT of them.  It cannot be meddled with or artificially altered.  There will never be more.  It simply retains value.  Banks can't take control of it and destroy it.
