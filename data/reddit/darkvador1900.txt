donate 1 bitcoin to jamie dimon.... and let him suck it up his ass
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:50:35
i believe it will take more time for the approval. the price will crash a little bit after the rejection but it will eventually recover. we have crossed a big milestone with the chineese exchanger regulations. this reduces volatility and enables a proper scaling in price as well as investors/ new bitcoiners

@_date: 2017-02-11 06:27:04
exactly my point. i have a decent amount of bitcoin. but if ETF is going to be present. i would like to get something as well.. like i put little amount of bitcoin in ICO's every now and then to widen my portfolio. i would also grab some shares of the winkel twins. i believe in diversification without moving from the original route. i.e hold bitcoin as well as hold shares in development around bitcoin.
thank you both for the answer. appreciate it
@_date: 2017-03-05 03:18:34
sure i do !! everyday!
@_date: 2017-03-11 04:43:55
i would hold that bid at that price as well but at the new ATH of 3000
@_date: 2017-03-05 03:17:38

@_date: 2017-03-24 18:16:26
for sure i will buy, but as a Hodler i also understand how others feel. it sucks.. really. it sucks
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:14:13
i agree and disagree.. i think what happened is whales saw a way to make the market panic. created the panic news and forced sell from small traders. bought everything lower and slowly rising. but this is not done yet. there is still more to come since the HardFork problem is not over yet.. there will be at least 1 more dip in my honest opinion. but that will happen really before or during the HardFork. whether we like it or not, the HardFork will happen due to different mindset and that cannot be change. however what we can do is really preserve the Core and make BU what it really is.. an ALT

jokes apart bring it on at $1 ill drop everything i have onto it. but i guess it will rocket back immediately as everyone would be buying as well. we all know too much about bitcoin and know it will not fail anymore.

will 1000 do? what do i get?
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:26:04
owh... well i trade on okcoin so i guess 98.5% okcoin price if thats good for you, but how would you want to be paid? its very little to be honest. i thought 50-100 btc or something
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:46:25
personally i dont care if you are doing it or not. but if you are, you will bring a positive contribution to the bitcoin community and bitcoin mining itself. and THAT is what i care about... so yeah, thumbs up

i got in at $3 to $25 and bought a few ups and downs... i already knew the dump was incoming. everybody knew that. BUT nobody expected that huge of a gap. ill give you that. got a few addresses on cold storage with decent amount. got xmr, ltc and etc (just a few to hold) and bought a few today like i posted. the weekend will see the price tank to 650 and monday to 500, it will stay there for some time and rise back up to 900$ between may and june. $2k end of this year IF.. a big IF there is no interference. i have a bad feeling those who trade gold and the huge pockets will buy bitcoins and dump it to make the price fall. because of bitcoins, gold is getting less attention. if you have a gold empire, it is obvious you will just send some sheep into bitcoins to make it crash so that parity is not reach let alone overcoming the price of gold... there are many so called genius on reddit. you cant say shit about bitcoins. and yet they want decentralization. i prefer to accept facts and reality. that there will be hundreds of thousands of spine on the street of bitcoins. every tibetian mastiff will bite whatever they can, making huge cash along the way.. i have already cashed enough to survive as a medium class.. i dont need to be rich or whatsoever. its stupid and distribution of wealth will not be equal. i do what i can to keep me and my family "ok".. at $3 i was already in long term. it crossed $1k twice and didnt excite me as much as developments and adoption surrounding bitcoins excites me.. else it will just be a pump and dump shit

@_date: 2017-01-17 22:01:48
i bought 1 btc on gox few weeks before closure $1140. could not get it out tho but i consider it a bitcoin bought at a milestone. also bought 1 at 1120$ which i consider a milestone. on the next rally i will buy 1 more at the +/- high price (even if it will fall down a bit later).. if someone cannot buy a full btc at a milestone. buy 0.1 or 0.05 it does not matter. just always buy a small piece on a milestone. in 5 years you would laugh at those who did not buy at all and say even if you bought lower a lot of times, you still bought a small amount at the higher everytime because you believed it was still cheap. (imo)

if you want to buy bitcoins, why dont you use platforms like localbitcoins.com? i know its a hassle but its also quite anonymous and i bet you wont have banking problems on that. you can use wire transfers, and several other remitances.. i know a guy who has $100 in his bank account and over 500 bitcoins in his wallet. whenever he needs to sell he just uses moneygram by being cautious not to sell too often. and when he trades he just send his coins from his wallet to his exchanger and back and so forth. 
p.s; sorry about your situation. hang in there tight brother.

welcome to Mauritius Island, where bitcoin is up to you to buy or sell. the government did its job to warn the people about buying into it. but at that time it was $3. so to resume, taxes there are only 15% of your total earnings yearly. and if you are a non resident you pay only 9% of your total yearly earning.
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:39:24
oh yes.. i feel we can see 900 or around again soon. however, depending on how things follows in the next couple of days. i will not pronounce any amount

i dont understand why people would doubt you (o.O) i mean if you are building a solar powered mining garage or whatever, thats your business.. right? and those who bet to pay you 1000 bitcoins. i doubt this will happen. but if it does, that could finance a large expansion of your project. which i think if its legit, its really nice. way to go. no matter what people say, proceed with whatever you do. its your decision.

sure there will be tax and documentation needed when cashing out, but it is a good news no matter what. for me personaly i take it as a small victory since coinbase did NOT give what the govt ask them in terms of informations and data as well as keys.. since they have been able to get the license without exposing their users. its a win.

i guess it depends on what kind of a trader you are and how you can observe/analyse and predict. but you never know. its risky. for all parties. hodlers as well as traders. but you have a better chance of standing out as a hodler than a trader. because you never know how the market will react

what many people fail to realise, or dont know. China is a different culture. for example, the big brands of the world knows china copies their clothes.. or watches even. so they complain to the government. the government sends police to "take care" of the situation. then you see the police seize the items of ONE seller. burn it in front of the press and announce in bold letters "government crack down on copied brands" there is a situation of " let it be " and "dont bother me" in china. Bitcoins is fine there as well. in fact it is better appreciated than bitcoin is apreciated in the states or europe countries. the Chineese loves technology and development. from young people to old people they all adapt to innovation.. their version of whatsapp "wechat" is based on the blockchain technology itself... all this to say bitcoin is fine in china, dont bother about the FUD being spread..... As usual, when there are so many news about bitcoin, you know a rally is near

interrestingly enough for me, i am glad the price drops a few times. many people who look foreward to adopt btc wants a specific price. i have a friend who was waiting 890-900 to buy. i really dont know why. maybe his finance did not permit over 900. but when the price plunge a little, expect that a few more adopters will join. its refreshing to know that what started between a handful of people is gradually growing into the biggest acceptance the world has known. Bitcoin came at the right time, right moment and to the right people to begin with. true they went astray later. but their contribution at start was very important. despite all the bad press, bitcoin still and will continue to live and progress.

for the time being there is absolutely no sign of slowing down or even a small feel of stabilization. all i can see is more down. probably till $500. because remember when we crossed $600 we did not correct. this is the first real correction since mid 2016.. the reason we went down the previous time was due to the finnex hack.

when you think how much you spent on these "pleasures" you will start thinking about your life's priority.. the only addiction i have.. is watches. and i spend shit load on them.. however, its not really a "money loss" it may be considered as an investment rather. not a fruitful one. but it holds value
@_date: 2016-12-29 06:13:41
maybe its undervalued. im not saying no. thats not my point..
my point is we are going to reach a high round number. this is what is making fund managers asking to buy bitcoins.

@_date: 2016-12-28 22:44:26
sold 33,573 XMR at 13$ to rebuy bitcoin around 3hours ago.. i bought the xmr a little after the whole alphabay thing.. it was $4 so what the heck. i saw it crashing.. it was discouraging. however i am a holder.. so i held the xmr in my trading account (yes i know its not safe) as the mymonero thing is not very safe.. however i sold all the xmr to buy more btc.. it might be a dumb move because i do believe in xmr.. i have easymonero.com a site which i developped but have not been able to launch properly.. (im open to ventures).. to resume. it is all in personal beliefs.. yes btc WILL dip after hitting $1000. maybe $10 dip or maybe $100 dip.. maybe even $500 dip. the market will go freaking mad after hitting that mark... however this can go both ways.. when bag holders or whales knows the community will more or less sell.. they can also rise the price to $1500 when everybody sold at $1000.. then sell at $1500.. make it crash back to $1000 and then rebuy.. thus small players lose but the whales gets the game.. like i said. its personal belief. if you think real estate or fiat is best.. well i will not discourage.. its your choice to make. not any idiot from the internet. at the end of the day, the whole idea about bitcoin is YOU control / decide on YOUR money.. so do it. whichever your decision, i hope you make it right.. as for me, personally.. i will not sell any bitcoin anymore.. stupidly panicked and had a few situations at $375 - $610.. sold 350bitcoins and now regret every single one of them i sold.. i am holding what i have left and have set my target at 2022 when i will be 40.. then maybe by 2022 i will be able to buy a quiet place with bitcoin itself.. hoping for the best in terms of government acceptance and mass adoption.. this is the only way..
@_date: 2016-11-04 19:25:56

bitcoins : 170 btc. sold 744. rebuy 690. platform cex. Monero: 12000 xmr sold 0.0072. standing balance of xmr sell is in btc (86ish). will wait for 0.006 to rebuy. platform polo. profit, enough for rest of the year till jan 2017.  the more the fuds are spread. the happier i am. whilst i have been holding for a long time, i am now event trading. day trade is a waste of money if you dont do it in a team. important advice : dont play with usdT. whilst its good in some thoughts, you lose 1 cent on every $ and with a high balance, you lose a lot... lesson learnt on that side. holding is good. buy (edit : BUT) when you see a dip incoming, sell quick and buy a bit lower. dont wait for total crash to buy, it will not happen. when you feel you have got $20 per btc, $30 btc and dont think it will fall more. rebuy immediately. if you can afford to wait, wait a bit then rebuy. i was about to rebuy at 714.. but thought to wait a little more. at 690 i could not afford to wait more since the gap was too big. true it went to 685 but i could have missed it too..

i do not care if "hypers" say bitcoin will be 10,000$ in 2020.. what is more important is : lets break the ATH and stay there.. because i do fear after breaking the ATH, dumpers will be doing what they do best.. even at $1000 there will be a lot of dumpers.. i honestly in early 2015 said, if bitcoin reaches $1000. i would dump everything.. but now.. no way am dumping.. am strong holding till i die.. i have sold too much this year.. now regret every bitcoin i sold..

bitcointalk is a rubbish place to be honest but the speculation section is a decent one. people dox each other in argument wars but the one who dox theymos is banned. lots of "police" there. the funds the forum get is over thousands of bitcoins. however we never hear the truth about how its used. its been 2 years since the supposed  thousands of bitcoins was sold to "build" the new forum. never heard of it again. Facts.
thanks for the tip btw, much appreciated

$300 is over 6 Billion $ being injected in LTC. i tend to be more realistic, with around $15-$22 on this pump, and by end of 2017 i believe we "might" see Litecoins at around $50-$70 mark if not $100. depends on what next is coming for Litecoin

actually 2700 will and must be tested. if only we tested 2900 again before we jumped to 5000. it would have been so much better. the support would have been higher than 2900 like it currently is. but those are just what if's and woulda shoulda. i have a friend who trades daily. if only he just HODLded.. he lost 40% of his net bitcoin balance with trying to "time the market".

for now... but if alts keep inflating, where will exchangers have bitcoins to issue withdrawals? there is one thing that 95% of the people not understanding. its not "new money" flowing in. its " alts being inflated ".. its different. it may be the same money cycling up and down and inflate an alt in that case the value of the alt will inflate as well in terms of the alt against btc and thus have more btc for the same amount of coins. but exchangers then have to find that btc for withdrawal. i dont know if you can understand my broken english but please read it a few times and try get it. its a really unsafe situation. ive taken all my btc from the exchangers to my cold wallet. for now i think ill leave it that way.

better get an electrum wallet on your desktop. much much safer. after a year or so, transfer from electrum to coinbase, sell or redeem or however it is done there.

Thailand, Singapore, Mauritius, Japan... no tax on crypto currency. up to 10,000$ by Moneygram &amp; W.u daily. thats your first answer.. and for the 2nd, find companies to invest in, but companies that revolves around Bitcoins. like VC for coinbase or things like that.

i dont mean to disrupt all the fiat and economic system, but why is everything paired to gold as last resort? i have a very bad feeling all of this will collapse someday. probably not in our lifetime but it will eventually collapse to have more of a barter system but in a more technological way. like a certain amount of bits and i mean BITS, for a certain amount of land, or food, or something in that sort of way..

@_date: 2017-07-28 01:03:19
send all coins to electrum. unplug from internet. wait for eth to hit anonymity (soon enough). buy eth, from myetherwallet itself. sell eth on exchanger to bitcoins. done. it could be done in a day 
@_date: 2017-05-14 12:00:13

@_date: 2017-07-24 21:05:45
first of all, re read all conversations, find a wallet.dat file
or at least find a bitcoin address, you could check the amount of bitcoins on the address by pasting the address on "blockchain.info" and press enter. that way you could at least know if it is worth the trouble. if you still have the wallet.dat file. let me know i will give you the next steps.

tell me your method of payment and i will point you to the direction you need to go
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:06:59
(1.) open electrum (safer to use electrum)
if not, download electrum...
(2.) get a new seed 
(3.) send all your coins from the previous electrum you have to the new one
(4.) wait for the fork
(5.) on August 2 [[better be safe than sorry]] send all Bitcoins from electrum 2 back to electrum 1
(6.) WAIT FOR ALL CONFIRMATIONS TO COMPLETE
(7.) your electrum 2 has now a hidden BCC balance
(8.) use another wallet which supports BCC
(9.) import electrum 2 seed into the BCC supported wallet
(10.) spend BCC
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:29:10

i am a huge watch collectioner. the reason i wont buy this watch is because its over $500 for a watch that you took from China. the model is the same. all you did was put the name cryptomatic and inflate the price.. Bitcoiners will be rich at some point if they helded enough. however i hope they dont become dumb enough. its totally not worth it. and if someone will challenge me i can send them a dozen of this watch for a fraction of that price. place your bet if you got guts. but dont play watch with me

buy a new computer. scan for malwares and trojans and keyloggers (yes even though its new).. download electrum. install electrum. Use Electrum MultiSig. just send your coins to the wallet. start by sending 0.001 first. then send 5 by 5. or 20 by 20 on different addresses that electrum provides you. go to settings, by default it is in mBTC, switch to btc.. make bloody sure you saved your seed in different places only to your and your most trusted person's knowledge.. take computer off internet and wireless. dont switch it on for unless you need to use your bitcoins.
