The bitcoin blockchain (network) is the technology. Fees are optional. Fees are paid to miners and miners are the ones verifying transactions - thus no 'middleman' per say.

What happens if the results are vastly different from the 'real' results? Will we see a bloody uprising?

The value of Bitcoin does not concern me even in the slightest.  
I am not trying to recruit you, I'm merely trying to teach you something you do not understand. Obviously I'm having a hard time getting through to you but I strongly and firmly believe everyone can learn.  
No, the change is not 'inevitable' until people like you try to understand what's right in front of them. It's a piece of clay and you can be part in shaping it.

Try using a program called Testdisk to see if you can recover anything from it.
I suspect it's a broken harddrive though. The chances of it containing any Bitcoins are very slim.

Remove the middleman (twitter) and just have a QR-code and a bitcoin logo on a plaque.

Everyone is a fan of Alan Watts, they simply haven't figured that out yet!

This is literally the equivalent of pointing to the bible and saying there's no other way.  
I never accused you of not acknowledging reality and your statement leads me to believe maybe there is hope for you to understand. Otherwise you would not reply.  
Bitcoin is a technology which can be built upon, it can be expanded. Every logical principle you can imagine in the world can be applied to Bitcoin. Right at this very moment the real heroes are working on improving Bitcoin for the good of us all.  
Current financial systems are not fair and they are definitely not 'good' for the common person. The sooner you realize Bitcoin is democratic, open for all and a technology with the words 'freedom' stamped all over the less burnt you will be.  
Bitcoin will not be stopped, the code is out, the seed has been planted and there is not a single reasonable person who would not want control over what is theirs and theirs only.  
I say again, you are scared, scared of change. Bitter because you don't understand. But any old dog can learn how to sit.

Explain Bitcoin firsthand and ChangeTip second.

I emailed Khaled half a year ago about this but I did not receive a response.

Neither can I, but boy am I glad it does.

I think we're all just wondering what's up with the complete silence from the NeoBee front. I'm curious myself.
@_date: 2014-11-13 13:49:56
Are you just conveniently forgetting about crime existing for all of society's lifetime before Bitcoin?
You are just another bitter, scared old man. Your mind is locked and you refuse to unlock it.

They have probably been told about the irreversible transactions and got that mixed up as 'everything regarding bitcoin purchases are final and cannot be edited in any way'.

Do explain for all of us.

I personally find no pain in pointing my camera to a QR-code. In regards to it not working underground is a connectivity issue and the same issue would apply to using Twitter. Unless of course you meant lighting, but almost every phone today has a flash.  
Additionally I would argue Twitter is more difficult than any mobile Bitcoin wallet and is not related to Bitcoin apart there existing a third party feature (ChangeTip).  
Now, there is nothing to say anyone should not display their twitter-handle as it gives the artist publicity. However that's a different topic and could be a different social-media platform other than Twitter.  
Re-reading your post I understand I missed the point that this would be intended to get performers involved in Bitcoin, I assumed they already knew about it. So I do apologize for that.  
Performers are naturally out after money and you're providing them with an additional way to receive money but the beauty of Bitcoin is the simplicity of peer to peer transfer.  
Point camera, select amount, hit send.  
I certainly did not mean to discourage your idea and acknowledge that your idea is functional but it is missing the crucial(simple) point of peer to peer technology.

There is Bitnation and also the Free State Project in New Hampshire involved in similar ideas.

Wow, I think we have a winner. Amazingly well written and I applaud you with all of my heart.  
You are an amazing human being and I wish upon you fulfillment of every single dream of yours.

I have already stolen all your reddit gold, but don't worry, I gave it all back.

It's neither adoption or bubble. The price is around the last peak and so people get way too excited and let their imagination fly.

It should be looked into on how to integrate OneName services with wallet contact lists if we're considering such features for wallets.

ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit - What this means is that this device is only capable of doing "bitcoin mining". 
Most of these devices have been postponed but are expected to arrive shortly within a month or two. They are very expensive but, they are very much wanted by bitcoin miners because soon GPU-mining will no longer be able to keep up with the difficulty of mining.

Send it without a fee, it'll take a while but I'm guessing for $.02 you can wait.

Paying money to unlock a feature like sending images, what is wrong with the business model these days. Every damn developer seems to think this is a great idea.
Whatever happened to paying full price and getting the full item?
I was very excited to buy this app, but reading that made me to say the least - much less interested.
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:02:59
Hey, any plans on adding a feature to let the user customize it freely? If I can design a few of my own shirts I would order tonight!

The only Swedish exchange I know of is Kapiton. They have had troubles since early December with payments. It has been crippling my ability to buy and sell bitcoins, luckily I have not lost any money and I received the bank transfer which I initiated around the time they started having issues.
