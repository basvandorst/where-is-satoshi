In one of my transactions this morning, I wanted to pay around 200 sat/B for the transaction and set this up accordingly in the Ledger Nano S GUI as this was the median transaction fee stated on btc.com, just to find the transaction placed with 103 sat/B, getting confirmed ~3hrs later.
I think I'm lucky it got confirmed so fast, but still - there are issues with Ledger Nano S and the calculation of fees.

I agree. 
What I was saying is, if you check out the POW hashrate graphs, you can clearly see some degree of decline in BCH as well as the already mentioned increase in BTC.
With a difficulty retarget of now 21% in 3 days and a switch of hashrate off BTC, full blocks might be here once more.

Posting that information is also a legal requirement in Austria.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:49:08
This sounds dangerous in terms of the upcoming difficulty adjustment. Next retarget shows +17% already according to fork.lol.

Next step: Cable management, bundled along the wall or beneath the table surface to the tower.

I think, Coinbase is going to be very cautious in taking legal actions in their current state.

Get out and keep spending, if this provides price jumps upwards.

I never spoke about B_cash fees, as they literally don't exist.
If you are missing hashpower on BTC due to the EDA of B_cash, transaction confirmations will drop, therefore paying higher fees to get prioritized within the next 1-3 blocks is, what raised the average fee price.
Don't accuse people wrongly please.

Nomi, why are you doing this? Stop.
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:02:40
Great advice. 
€ is strong right now, you get almost 1.2$ per Euro spent, which also lowers Bitcoin prices for €-spenders and will raise ROI as soon as dollar stabilized again.
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:52:39
Probably yes.
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:55:15
Someone definitely wanted to be in the next block.
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:24:51
No, this is because Bcash got difficulty adjusted again and will need a week to "recover".
This downward spiral will happen as long as Bcash is there.

EUR to USD conversation rates make Bitcoin cheaper for us right now.

Fees wouldn't be an issue, if tx spam wouldn't be a thing. There are currently 30k of around 50k unconfirmed transactions with fees of 0-20 sat/B (around 0.33 USD)

Good riddance.

Probably maybe yes or no.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:31:42
Sure, but as long as there are apps like Roger Vers Bitcoin wallet, which sets BTC fees way higher than it should.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:41:49
You don't have to.
If apps and wallets adapt to considerable amounts of fees, this will be a no-brainer for you as well.

Translation for non-German speakers:
Bitcoin breaches 10,000 Dollar.
With the recent price raise, price of the online-currenty multiplied by ten during this year. Early 2017, a Bitcoin was worth less than 1,000 USD.
The boom of the crypto currency Bitcoin keeps on goin. It's price reached five digits.

Tell me which empty word phrases may lighten up OP's loss. 
Not even cashing out the minimum needs is a  unjustifyable move.

Which wouldn't be an issue as I'm ordering at my vendor at current prices. No matter if they rise or fall, I get what I ordered, even if the EPS payment takes 3 days.
They'll cancel the order after 10 days of no payment.
