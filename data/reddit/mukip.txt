OK well that sounds great for shady merchants who want to catch people by surprise. But how does it benefit the consumer? And please don't say it "saves time"; everybody has at least a few seconds to spare to double-check spending decisions.

Interesting, thanks!

Why is it important to be able to not have a confirmation notice?
@_date: 2014-12-31 03:29:54
Past performance is no guarantee of future results; this applies to both comments mentioned in the OP. 
@_date: 2014-12-24 12:08:23
I see, thanks. Isn't M-Pesa safer and more popular than Bitcoin? In that case, it seems like M-Pesa is the solution for a lot of people rather than Bitcoin.

The original statement was that there has been more achievement in the past 30 years than the rest of history; you are moving the goalposts.
@_date: 2014-12-24 12:19:41
Thanks. I think you should have asked them about how users manage their security over there, this is something I don't get.

I don't know why you are getting downvoted, I mean I know exactly why: you are addressing one of the more persistent and nonsensical myths about bitcoin right now. 
I can buy things online with Paypal in a transaction that takes seconds. Bitcoin is not offering some unique advantage here and I'm really perplexed by how lots of people on r/bitcoin think this is a selling point of bitcoin.

There were plenty of important discoveries made without the use of computers, such as vaccines, gravity, electricity, evolution, penicillin, anesthetic, etc!

It's downright unethical to encourage adoption among people who lack the technical savvy to secure their coins. There's far too much intellectual gymnastics and dissembling whenever this topic comes up; people are saying that poor people in third world countries should set up bitcoin wallets (so that their meagre wages can get stolen by thieves).
@_date: 2014-12-24 12:46:27
That's too much of a cavalier attitude for my liking when we are talking about people's savings.

...Why is it important to not have to click a confirmation notice? It takes hardly any time at all and provides a useful feature (defending against accidental misclicks). That's a weird feature to want to get rid of and I don't understand why that is being pursued here.
@_date: 2014-12-26 17:15:33
You'd have to use a very narrow definition of the word accomplishment to justify that statement. There's more to life than computers.
@_date: 2014-12-21 07:24:53
"Coke used subliminal messages to sell cola, therefore removing confirmation boxes is not shady"... OK then.
@_date: 2014-12-24 12:38:33
That's a good point, you don't need to own a computer to use one. But surely you need to do more than just set up a wallet. You need to know how to keep your coins safe and that's a rather more involved process, no?

It's called volatility.
@_date: 2015-01-11 11:46:03
You could say "maybe" about millions of hypothetical scenarios. You need solid reasons to believe it's going to happen, not just maybe's.

Fair enough. It's not so much a comment directed at you as everybody repeating the "they said the Internet was a fad!" comments the past few months.
@_date: 2015-03-10 19:17:27
The entire thread, indeed the sub-reddit, is filled with comments like this. Just because you were right about something once doesn't mean you are right about Bitcoin or anything else. 
Although a lot of purported examples of the stupid majority not getting something seem to be made-up. For instance, the idea that the Internet was widely disregarded as an up-and-coming technology is a persistent and mistaken myth here.
The majority of people disagreeing with you doesn't make you a visionary.  Feel free to brag about your prophetic prowess if Bitcoin becomes a success and not before then. You should be aware that a lot of crackpots use a similar arguement when proposing non-mainstream scientific theories (such as perpetual motion engines, etc); the infamous Galileo gambit. 
Innovators often perceive something that many people don't and make a success out of that knowledge. But most business start-ups fail, which means a lot of entrepreneurs attempting to be innovative were off the mark in their perceptions.

Putting lots of money into something does not guarantee success. Dotcom bubble?
@_date: 2015-03-10 23:55:41
You should read more comments if you aren't seeing it. Like this one:
This guy's gonna be so smug when the sheeple realize what a visionary he was all along!!!
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:27:49
"I'm so blown away by how easy and downright fun it is"
...Really? Try to keep an eye on those euphoria levels, champ.
@_date: 2018-12-04 02:11:21
Oh and, "what if the 12yo consents tho?"
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:39:54
Because nobody in crypto ever lost money, right? 
@_date: 2018-12-04 02:10:40
You forgot, "people thought the Internet was just a fad in the 90s!" (they didn't).

A ponzi scheme is when a scammer uses the money of recent investors to pay earlier investors. What you described hasn't got anything to do with a ponzi scheme. That's just money printing which causes inflation.
