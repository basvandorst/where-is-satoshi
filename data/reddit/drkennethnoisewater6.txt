Well it can be a bubble because it can go to 0%. It can also be a bubble because while the use of bitcoin can increase, the price can still drop because the two are not currently connected.

From deposits. Banks cannot create money from thin air, its the just same money going around. You can do fractional reserve banking just as well with bitcoin as with fiat. r/bitcoin is super ignorant about even of the most basic economics concepts...
@_date: 2019-03-28 09:17:55
Its same money going around. Like I said you can do the same thing with bitcoin so are we creating bitcoins out of thin air?
Let me illustrate. I am a bank and you are a customer. You deposit 1 bitcoin to my bank. I take 0.9 bitcoins of that and keep 10% of that as a reserve as you suggest. I give that 0.9 as a loan to Johnny who goes and buys a bicycle with it. The bicycle shop deposit the 0.9 in my bank again. So now you have 1 bitcoin and the shop has 0.9 bitcoin when we started with 1. We created 0.9 bitcoin out of nothing! Or did we? Isnt it just the same bitcoin going around? 
This is how banks ”create” money. There is no magic license that allow banks to literally create new money. Its just taking deposits and giving out loans. Hoping that not too many people want their deposits out at the same time (bank run). Bitcoin does nothing to stop this. After all it is based on simple contracts outside of the currency/money. There are probably bitcoin exchanges that do the same thing. Just without their customers knowing about it.
@_date: 2019-03-28 10:36:52

Not OP, but fractional banking is just as easy (or hard) with bitcoin as it is with US dollars. All you would have to do is take Bitcoin demoninated deposits and give Bitcoin denominated loans. The difference would be that you would not have a central bank which would be likely cause instability for the same reason the price of Bitcoin is unstable. There are no parties that can or have the will to act against their own interest to stabilize the markets.
@_date: 2018-06-16 16:19:03
The two scenarios you described are not in conflict. Let me expand my example a little bit. 
The loaner now buys something from a company with the 0.5 he borrowed. That company holds a deposit account at the same (and only) bank and deposits the 0.5 bitcoin it received into its account. Now the bank can once again lend that 0.25 of 0.5 (holding 1/2 or 0.25 as reserve). Now the you still have 1 bitcoin, the bank has 0.75 in reserve and the companty has 0.5 bitcoin. This cycle can continue until you have "created" maximum amount of money/bitcoin determined by the money multiplier which you alluded to. Yours was 2/100 and mine 1/2. My multiplier is 2, yours 50. The reserve is not counted towards the multiplier.
Fractional-reserve banking does not require a central bank. And like you said, there only ever was 1 physical bitcoin much like there only is "one" dollar in fiat banking (not literally). That one dollar is called base money.

Why is there no middleground? Why not go for smaller blocks if blocksize has no effect on average transaction fee and we could support more nodes?

Banks cannot create new fiat either. At least in the way I think you think. Its a common misunderstaning. Let me try to illustare with an example. 
You have excess bitcoin and would a return so you deposit it in a bitcoin bank.  The bank is in control of your bitcoin. They lend half of your bitcoin to someone else. In this simplified case: you have a bitcoin, the loaner has a half a bitcoin and the bank has half a bitcoin in reserve. A total of 2 bitcoins. 
So we created a new bitcoin. Or did we? You tell me. Either way this is the way fiat banks and fractional reserve banks work. They dont literally create new money. Its the same money going around. 
The reserve stops it from going to infinite as well as the fact that the less reserve you have the more sensitive you are to bank runs. 
So what happens if you want your deposit back? If you over the half of it (the reserve) the bank fails. This is why banks pay more deposit eith restricted withdrawals.
Can or does bitcoin stop this? No, as it based on contracts outside the bitcoin protocols.

For something to have intrinsic value it has to have value even if you could never exchange it with something else. Without the ability to exchange, bitcoin it is just random bits on your hard drive as good as any other set of random bits. At least gold you can use for something which gives it intrinsic value.
@_date: 2019-06-30 11:34:08
I wish you and him would be more patient and elaborate what you are trying to say because Im not getting it.
1. Gold has appreciated faster than inflation for the last 50 years at least. A simple fact.
2. There is some volatility in the price but much less than bitcoin. Again,  dont see what could be possibly so controversial about that either.
3.  Gold is not a store of value but bitcoin is. The part about bitcoin is a little bit of my own intrepretation but, given the context, I feel like it is implied.
Given 1. and 2., I dont see how 3. could be true. What am I missing here and why are you two so upset?
@_date: 2019-06-30 05:48:15
Seems like you should have sold instead of holding. Price would have to be $50,000 in 2020 and while still being a "buy". 10x every 2 years or so isnt sustainable for very much longer.
@_date: 2019-06-30 08:28:02
Right, the color legend for the red is "hodl" instead of "sodl". Had you sodl when in the hodl area and bought back in areas yellow or below then you would have made something like 1,000x compared to the hodl guy. If you believed in this chart then holding in the red areas is stupid. That is a fact with the benefit of hindsight. Not my bear or bull thesis for the future.
@_date: 2019-02-14 16:48:20
No. Investing, or more accurately speculating, with bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is a zero sum game. It does not create any new wealth. So naturally it would do nothing to solve the problem. Any particular pension fund could win big but it would have to be offset with others losing.
@_date: 2019-02-15 21:48:18
I'm not sure there is much of an argument to be made. If that was helpful in terms of wealth then why not fork Bitcoin, sell 0.0000000001% of the coins to someone for 1 buck and suddenly you would have created a trillion dollars of new wealth! How would you get someone to buy the coins? Well you could promise to pay them a million for his troubles with that new wealth...

Golds price has appreciated faster than inflation. I guess you could say that it has not perfectly matched inflation and that there is some volatility but that is an odd criticisms coming from a bitcoin advocate (I assume). Talk about the pot calling the kettle black...

They could just declare it illegal and it would be dead. By dead I dont mean literally but something like back to 2012 levels of activity. No businesses would accept it as payment, banks would not facilitate payments to exchanges, exchanges themselves would shut down, investors would sell their positions. etc. etc. The fact that you could still move bitcoins does not matter.
@_date: 2019-06-30 07:56:03
There is plenty of space for growth between 200%+ CAGR this picture assumes and 0%. So me saying "this is unsustainable" tells you approximately nothing of my bearishness or bullishness. At this pace bitcoins market cap would about $50 trillion in 5 years and a single bitcoin will be worth roughly $230 billion in 15 years. Only thing we will see is if this trend has already ended or does it still have a year or two in it.

@_date: 2019-12-15 10:09:13
Why would it take a year for the "reduced supply to work its way through the market"? Its should pretty close to instantenous. Maybe days or even weeks if you think that miners are still selling their inventory from prior to the halving for a while.
 Im gonna say that the price increase was entirely demand driven. The 500 dollar price already included the halving, because it was known, but not the change in demand, because it was not known in advance.
@_date: 2019-12-23 21:31:08
Can words repeat?
@_date: 2019-12-15 06:40:07
Its being priced in continously. There is no moment that suddenly something is priced in (unless new information come in suddenly).
@_date: 2019-12-15 11:22:33
If OPEC came out and said, "turns out that the oil reserves of the world are half of what we previously estimated". How many seconds would it take for the price to shoot up? This is even with no effects to actual supply yet. It wouldn't be a slow and steady increase as the markets slowly dry up.
Supposedly, Bitcoin has this kind of "OPEC moment" coming and everyone is acting completely irrationally. If you knew of the news that OPEC would be releasing 4,5 months before anyone else, what would you do? You would sell everything you own and leverage your long position in oil to the max. After all, you couldn't lose. 
In Bitcoins case there is no news. Everyone already knows of the coming halving. But according to you, they are not acting on it. And according to you, didn't act on it last time even after the halving. I would love to know, how you know that it has not been priced in yet? What would the price be had it been priced in? And obviously, given this coming "OPEC moment", you have sold everything and are in debt to your eyeballs buying Bitcoins.
I also think you are confusing demand and price. While there might be some scenarios where exclusivity and scarcity can actually increase demand, I dont think Bitcoin is one of them. You can't wear it or display it. Supply of Bitcoin is completely arbitary. It could 10x of what is has been or 1/10th and it would not affect Bitcoins utility or anything else (and therefore demand) but the price.

Logistics of Bitcoin fractional banking: I deposit 10 bitcoins to EvilBank. EvilBank has a customer A that needs a loan. EvilBank is committed to a reserve ratio of 0.1. They can and do lend 9 bitcoins (using the real bitcoins deposited by me) to customer A and they keep the 1 bitcoin as reserve. Customer A goes and spends 9 (real) bitcoins in a bike shop. Bike shop deposits those 9 (real) bitcoin to EvilBank. 
In the end, I have 10 Bitcoins, customer A has 9 bitcoin debt and bike shop has 9 bitcoins. Did we create more Bitcoins or not? Doesn't really matter since either way this is how fractional reserve banking works. If you think no, then I would agree with you, but understand then that the answer is the same for fractional reserve banking with fiat money as well. 
The differences are in the capabilities of the central bank. They couldn't pay interest on the reserves (and therefore would have less ability to control interest rates) or act as lender of last resort. 
I really couldn't tell you what the effect of this would be on the modern economies. Neither can anyone else. But what I can tell you is that it hardly the source of all evil. Any problem that preceeded central banks would certainly not be solved and many developments since might potentially be lost.


It is just debt and wont end Bitcoin. I'll loan some Bitcoins from someone with the promise of paying back and paying interest on top. It is not very complicated. But I did end up spending more bitcoins than I owned or had an income for. Deficit spending.

@_date: 2019-01-19 17:14:10
Need to freshen up on your economics. If there is deflation then the income of the employer gets smaller and smaller (after all the prices of your employers products get smaller and smaller by definition) in absolute terms and sooner or later they couldn't pay you anymore.
Example: back when Bitcoin was $1 you made a deal with your employer that they would pay you 5,000 bitcoins a month. Since then there has been massive deflation and a Bitcoin is now $3,500. Do you think that your employer has no need or desire to cut your 5,000 bitcoins a month wages?
Deflation is not some free lunch... 
@_date: 2019-01-17 21:50:16
The y-axis' are not synchronized. Terrible graph.
@_date: 2019-01-19 16:32:06
So in this neat scenario of yours, in a deflationary environment the pay is cut less that deflation and in an inflationary environment the raise will be less that inflation? So with deflation employers just simply donate money and only when there is inflation do they get greedy? 
Let's face it, your purchasing power development has little to do whether there is reasonable deflation or inflation and everything to do with your bargaining power. If your employer can and will screw you when there is inflation, he will screw you if there is deflation.
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:08:25
Inflation is not the increase in amount of money in circulation. It's the change in the amount of services and goods you get for a unit of currency. They tend to be correlated but not the same thing. Bitcoin has had 200% inflation in the last year or so and prior to that had massive deflation.
@_date: 2019-01-19 13:02:25
You... you  think that wages are not going to be cut if there is deflation? Not to be mean but where is your brain?
@_date: 2019-01-19 20:09:17
Argument was (as far as I understood it) that deflation is somehow better because supposedly employers would not care or had no reason to cut wages. If productivity outpaces the deflation then there might not be any cuts but you cant THEN argue that there would not be raises outpacing inflation... The only thing that matters is the bargaining power of the worker...
@_date: 2018-07-05 06:28:21
No offense but this is quite silly. Obviously the pace of decline in dollars terms is getting slower since every time BTC loses value a % change is less and less in dollars terms. Make the axis logarithmic for actually meaningful analysis.

You can do fractional reserve banking just as well with bitcoin. No difference at all. You deposit your bitcoin and the banks lend your bitcoin forward. Now someone has your ”physical bitcoins” and you still have your deposit. New bitcoins created or not, but either way it is the same for FIAT. So if you think no new bitcoins were created then you can’t then argue that fractional reserve banking creates new FIAT. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:52:24
Unfortunately it is you who doesn't understand fractional banking. Let me illustrate with gold coins. You have 10 golds in your pocket. You go to a bank and deposit your 10 gold coins. You now have 10 gold coins in your account. The bank then takes 9 of those gold coins (I'll use the same reserve rate as you did) and lends them to Jack who wants to buy a motorcycle. Jack pays interest on the loan and part of the interest goes to you as interest on your deposit. Jack buys the motorcycle and thus the motorcycle company now has 9 gold coins. They deposit them to the same bank as you. Now you have 10 gold coins and the motorcycle company has 9 for a combined 19. There are only 10 gold coins in the vault. Did the bank create any new money? Depends how you look at it. 
The bank could take 8.1 of the motorcycle company's deposit and lend again and the cycle continues until there are 90 gold coins in deposit and 10 in the vault like you mentioned. The bank has no ability to print or create new money anymore than you do. It's all on paper. This same mechanic works whether with fiat, bitcoin or gold coins. With bitcoin you would send 10 bitcoins out of your wallet into theirs and your account would be credited with 10 bitcoins. Where those 10 bitcoins are in the literal sense is out of your control. The bank simply "guarantees" that when you want to use your 10 bitcoins they have the liquidity allow that.
What would happen if both you and the motorcycle company would want to take out your deposit? The bank would collapse and there would be a banking crisis. Before central banks this was very common occurrence.
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:59:02
I think you are going a step too far. Intrinsic value is a well established concept and has practical value, for example, when analyzing bitcoin price behavior.
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:03:52
Plenty of things have intrinsic value. Anything that does not need to be converted or exchanged for something else and still has value has intrinsic value. A spoon has intrinsic value, energy has intrinsic value etc. etc.

Is your argument against a block size increase seriously that it would make bitcoin more popular? 
@_date: 2017-07-11 06:37:52
Every transaction and every potential transaction has a marginal utility. This marginal utility determines the willingness to pay fees. The transactions are ordered by their marginal utility from largest to smallest. Every block takes the top X transactions from this ordered list. The size of X is determined by the block size. The larger X is, the further down the list we get and the lower the average fee/marginal utility. It does not get any simpler than that. This effect is not temporary and it is independent of the number and distribution of the transactions and their marginal utilities.  
Look blocks could/would eventually fill up and the fees could become higher than they have ever been before but only if something fundamentally changed and fees would still be higher with 1MB in the same situation. This is not even economics 101. Let me put it this way, if what you were saying were true then decreasing the size of the blocks would not increase prices. With a 100KB blocks we would we would still have the same fees right? Nevermind that there would only be 1 tx every 3 seconds or something. Or why not 1KB? Imagine how decentralized we could get, with no adverse effects.
For arguments sake let's now say that the block size would be 1GB. The block were 95% filled with "legitimate" transactions. Now someone with an interest in even larger block wants to start spamming. He would need to still create 50MB of transactions just to fill the blocks and not only would he need to send 50MB of transactions, he would need to do it with high enough fees to actually disrupt anything. Spamming would be incredibly expensive.

I recently went through this with blockchain.info. I think they did it the right way. They informed the account holder (obviously me), through all channels, that someone had requested the removal of the 2FA. Then they had a mandatory / cannot-be-sped-up wait period of like 10 days or so until they removed the 2FA. 
The only real way of making the process more secure would have been requiring documentation to prove my identity but in that case they would have needed to know the original account holders identity to have something to check against.
I believe having no way to remove 2FA would result in bigger losses than doing removal the best possible way.
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:58:38

@_date: 2017-07-22 12:02:52
If you have a wallet with 1,000 bitcoins that you cannot send to anyone, ever, in any circumstance. They will always be in one of your wallets, forever. How does a stronger mining network make them more valuable to you?
Can I burn bitcoins? How do I get from having bitcoins to having energy? If I have to buy it using bitcoins, then the value comes from the ability to exchange them to something else not the bitcoins themselves. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value.
I don't quite understand how it is such a hard concept to understand that bitcoins do not have intrinsic value. What makes it even more frustrating is that it does not matter AT ALL for what bitcoin is trying accomplish. Just like it does not matter that a phone without the ability to call someone, has no value (let's ignore other uses for simplicity) because you CAN call someone. But it still the truth. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value.
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:08:17
Larger blocks would decrease transaction costs all things being equal. As in there is no scenario where 1MB would not be more expensive than 2MB from an economics point of view. It would not be temporary. 
Segwit and LN are not enough for scaling meaningfully. The centralization worry is blown way out of proportion. Satoshis point was that block size alone will not be enough to solve scaling issues (which is true), not that we need to stay at 1MB forever. 2MB today is certainly a lot less than 1MB 8 years ago.

Why do I care about securing those bitcoins that I cannot send to anyone for any purpose? That is what I'm trying to say.

Unlike stocks bitcoin has no intrinsic value and unlike fiat it has no central bank to bet against the market. Everyone is on the same "side" of the market. Crucially everyone knows this and knows that others know this as well and thus they try to out maneuver each other. Size or volume will not meaningfully diminish effect. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:29:43
I though I did answer you're question when I said yes the envelope has intrinsic value. Although maybe for different reason than you do? Or are you saying it does or doesn't? I'm not sure.
If I were to send a message or money in envelope then I would like it to be secured. How it relates to bitcoin I don't know. In terms of the envelope's intrinsic value it does not help it's case as it needs the contents (in other words something not intrinsic) for it's security properties to have value. If the letter is empty, I don't care how secure it is.
Let's try and keep it simple. Please answer this question: what are you going to do with bitcoins that you cannot send to anyone? That always and forever going to be in your wallet.
And I'll try to this explain for probably the last time. Intrinsic value is value that "comes from with in". It does not need something else to give it value. If bitcoin would have intrinsic value then you would  create your own. After all you are creating something identical to bitcoin and it has value so why would you not make something valuable. The same reason you don't make your own currency, it only has value if someone accepts it as payment. What gives bitcoin value is that people accept it as payment. If you no one accepts it as payment, it does not have value. Therefore it has no intrinsic value.
