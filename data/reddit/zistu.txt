Who is buying all these bitcoins? And why?
Not a troll. Really want to understand why are people buying at this point?

Abey chutiye. 
Look up the definition of store of value before arguing over the Internet about it. 
Bitcoin may be great, it can make people investing in it lots of money. Or make them lose it. It may or may not be revolutionary. 
But it is a not of store of value.

That some people will think that we've reached a bottom and will buy is true. 
But we're seeing 50 Million USD being pumped into the market just to move from 6500 to 7500. Is there really that much capital available to fund this and at this point? When the situation is anything but clear? 
Can easily go down and down still.

If he sells at 7500 and buys at 6000, hes the smart one not you.

Yes exactly. And that is why Car is not a store of value.
