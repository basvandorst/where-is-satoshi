So the fork is intended to aleviate congestion on the BTC network right? When do we start to see if that actually happens or not?

Woah... I smell a marketing opportunity

I was going to buy in BTC when it was $800 a couple months ago. Ah well.

Just curious, can you describe that interview? Its not relevant to me personally but that sounds crazy

I'm at the point where I don't worry about buying in local peaks. That difference in $50/coin here and there won't matter with the amount of potential growth were looking at now

They're just negging Bitcoin to buy in cheaper. Classic.

Everytime I almost tell someone about crypto I think...
what if I oversell the likelihood and immediacy of them getting rich and they put all their money into it then lose it... eh, better not.
what if I oversell how volatile and unregulated the market is and they look at me like an idiot for gambling my money away... eh.
what if I sell it just right and they decide to put a reasonable amount of money in it, but they aren't tech-savy enough to do it themselves, so they need me to handhold them through the whole process... fuck that.
I decided, if they're supposed to know, then they'll have figured it out and put money in themselves. Otherwise, I keep it to myself and others I trust to make their own decisions with it.
