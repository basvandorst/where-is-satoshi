I've been out of the block explorer game for a while, but it seems like normal behaviour - see  as a similar type of transaction. 
If you've received multiple payments to the same address, it won't actually group the payments as one input and increase your transaction size. Also a reason why address reuse is discouraged.

Sweeping is sending it to a new address and creating a transaction on the blockchain. When you scan the private key of your address in your mobile wallet you create a transaction to a new address in your mobile wallet.
Importing is where you use the private and public keys in the mobile wallet without taking the bitcoin off the other wallet (in most cases this would be a paper wallet). A transaction is not published to the blockchain. This allows you to continue to use the other wallet as a backup.
Importing a paper wallet into your wallet has a caveat - if you don't spend the whole balance the remaining goes to a change address that you don't control because you don't have the corresponding private key. This is why sweeping paper wallets is preferred.

 - I'm not a US citizen but the general idea is that bitcoin is labelled as property by the US government and you must pay capital gains tax on any bitcoin you sell. You must take into account the price you bought at and the price you sold at and claim capital gains/losses on the amount.

Your node will relay transactions broadcast on the network to other nodes and validate that they follow the bitcoin consensus rules. That is it if you're not using it as a wallet.

I would recommend it. With Trezor the private keys are stored on the device, and you can only send if the device is attached to a computer or compatible mobile wallet.
Also, you have the seed words so if the Trezor gets lost you can get another and import the seed that way. 
Things can get tricky if the device is lost or stolen though. At the moment if you're using the Segwit addresses (or the new bech32 ones with the firmware update I saw) you would need to import the seed into a wallet that supports them (Electrum is one of the few that I know of) and then send the coins to a wiped trezor so you have a whole new seed - this prevents whoever finds or has the old one to spend your coins.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:49:33
I'm not 100% on this. If you import keys from a software wallet that is HD compatible (most wallets are now) then when you spend a partial balance the remaining should go to a change address derived from your software wallet and be able to be spent from that wallet. But you would then need to import the change address' private key to use it like the previous address. But I don't exactly know how the change address would be derived if the transaction was initiated from the mobile wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:45:12
Any bitcoin transaction from one wallet to another will incur a fee. Now, with mycelium you can't set custom fees and are forced to use their algorithm to determine how much you'd be paying. 
If that's too much and you don't care about when it gets confirmed, you could try importing the seed into something like electrum to set a custom fee - though it'll probably take longer.

Looks like you have a response on Bitcointalk. Usually operation not permitted means that you don't have sufficient permissions to perform the action. In this case I would say whatever boost::filesystem::space is trying to do doesn't have sufficient privileges when you run bitcoind as your user. But this shouldn't be the case if it's a standard ubuntu installation. 
My guess is that boost::filesystem::space is having trouble reading the HDD

Looks like maybe it's not reading the HDD because /media has different permissions from /home - I would think you should see the /media... on the second line.

The technical solution would be to use an HD-compatible wallet on a mobile device and show a different QR-Code to each customer. This way each customer can't see how much money you're making and how much other customers are spending.
An even more technical solution would be to use an xpub from something like Trezor and build a solution that would only allow receiving addresses to be generated - this way the mobile device or whatever you're displaying the QR-Code on doesn't actually hold the bitcoins

From what I understand, Electrum is HD-compatible and would generate a new address once the key was swept and create new addresses for any change. I don't know if it would do the same for imported addresses' change.

I had a different issue, but it could be related. I created two wallets, sent some money from one wallet to the other's pocket stealth address. The transaction went through fine and in my sending wallet it shows the bitcoin address it sent to, not the stealth address, not a large deal, I can check the blockchain for payment . 
However, that address is not listed in the receiving pocket's address as having received anything, or even existing as a receiving address. 
The problem with stealth addresses is unless it works for you, you can't tell if it is going to the right place as it has to create new addresses.

If the coins were sent to the address you'd wanted and it shows in your wallet, if it was broadcast it will show in a block explorer. I would make sure you grab the address and transaction hash from the wallet before backing up/updating so you have some proof to fall back on if needed.
After updating and importing your old wallet I would say there are two outcomes. Either the updated wallet will not show the transaction and thus the coins will be back in the wallet, or it will update and rebroadcast the transaction and the coins will be sent.
But if the transaction is broadcast and not confirmed within some time (can't say exactly how long) the network will reject the transaction and the coins will go back to your wallet.
@_date: 2015-12-05 13:24:51
Depends on the client, but it's mostly just finding the Sign/Verify option in the menu. With Bitcoin Core, there is such an option. It asks for the address you wish to sign with, and the message. Once you click sign it will output a string that is a signature of the message signed with that address. (I do have electrum as a backup, I'll have to check later where it's located)
To verify that it was done correctly, you can use the verify option to enter the message, address, and signature. Core will tell you if the signature is valid for the address and message that you provided, proving that the message was not altered after signing.

OP should be warned as well that when spending part of a paper wallet from the wallet directly (and not importing/sweeping)it goes to an unknown change address, so the transaction should include a custom change address that they have control of or send back to the original address like Blockchain does.

Not necessarily. If you received bitcoin TO that address it would be a different story, but once you send from that address who's to say you didn't steal the private key or find it lying on the ground? 
Signing is still based on trust, while it would prove you had access to those bitcoins, you may not have had access until AFTER the funds were spent. Signing also doesn't address any time-specfic things like block confirmations, which is addressed by the blockchain itself.
Basically signing allows you to say "Send bitcoins to me, here's a signed message proving I have access to that address"

Most wallets don't store any information such as who you are (emails, names, physical address etc.) and are only concerned about bitcoin addresses as far as I'm aware. The wallets are designed to add a fee so your transaction can be included quickly. You can set the fee to zero, but the chance that it will get picked up quickly or at all goes down drastically (the person that you are trying to pay won't get their money until it is added to the blockchain).
If you want a place to buy bitcoins anonymously, I've heard localbitcoins and btc-e would be the two places to do that because localbitcoins is a place that matches you with other people in your area for in-person transactions, and btc-e is in a grey area where they don't do a lot (or any) KYC/AML stuff that most/all US/Canadian exchanges are required to do. 
As for the services requiring fees, they do deal in money (bitcoin) so they do want to be paid for the use of the services, which is why there's usually a fee for withdrawing your bitcoins. The fees in this context are usually quite a lot less than regular financial institutions (no monthly fees for storing your money on a exchange, no overdraft, nobody keeps calling you to sign up for new services), but that doesn't stop them from trying. They are a business after all.
For paper wallets, one of the more useful ones is bitaddress.org as it can do batches of paper wallets and you can save the webpage for offline use, or there is bitcoinpaperwallet.com if you want a fancier looking one.

Your money isn't "going" anywhere. Once it's in bitcoin you're valuing the bitcoin at the dollar rate which fluctuates depending on what people will pay for it. if the majority of people are willing to pay 400AUD that's the price of bitcoin at the moment.
You can think of it like buying property (or another currency). When you buy a TV, the market price of that TV may go up or down depending on what the buyer is willing to pay for it. when you sell the TV, the TV may be worth less than when you bought it. 
The money you paid for it hasn't disappeared, but the value of your asset has changed, so whoever is holding the dollars that you paid originally for the TV still has 600AUD. preev's calculator may decide to only use a specific market or a different calculation than another chart or calculator and get a different number.

It'd be nice. But if you're not selling it's not taxable via the guidance from last November. As long as you have another wallet setup I don't see how that's different (as it's tax-free). Unless you mean the bank paying interest on your holdings

the first one is like I were to send you a part of a bitcoin from one of my addresses, the change would be funneled back into one of my addresses, yes.
The second is if I don't have enough in one of my addresses, so the wallet software amalgamated enough bitcoin from my other addresses to make the payments to the addresses. One of those addresses may be change if I didn't send the whole amount.
The next would be something like if I split all my coins among five different wallets and left none in the original address.

When you send a bitcoin to someone, you see the transaction sent immediately. You do need to wait for the transaction to get at least 1 confirmation to have it be spendable in the receiver's wallet. But the receiver can still see that you sent them those coins before then.

The bitpay 15 minute window is only to get the quote for 1 BTC. It essentially freezes the price of a BTC for that 15 minutes so it doesn't fluctuate between when you make the link and click pay. The 3 confirmations thing is most definitely an issue with the service itself, you don't need to keep any windows open for 3 confirmations if you're using BTC, once it's on the network, it's on the network.

(I'll take a shot, my cryptography lingo may be a little off)
A signed message is just that a message. I can take one of my addresses and use the private key to sign this comment's hash so that you know I was the one to write it as long as you can verify I'm the only owner of the address. It's not necessary to post it to the block chain, and can also be encrypted with PGP etc if you choose before signing (this may require more software as I think most PGP use their own key generation instead of bitcoin keypairs).
as for the second question, I believe the receive payment qr code already exists, but don't know if you would be able to add a signed message as part of the protocol (part of the payment).

Yes, change would all go back into one address unless your wallet software allows you to choose where to send your change. There would be two recipients, but of course you have no way of knowing whether that's actually the same person or not.

They really should be near-free in context as the bitcoin wallet for android has lowered fees to 0.01mBTC with little to no issues. but if you're sending a large amount at once, that is free for all intents and purposes. 
You *can* set the fee to 0, but unless it gets into a heavily populated block with fees, or there are miners willing to pad blocks with 0-fee transactions it may take a while or never. That's the problem with incentive - if there is none it may not get done.

I believe that's because Google (Finance) treats it as a [currency]( and not a [stock]( and they don't have cards for currencies. Edit: the wikipedia page says it does, but I haven't tried other currencies yet. Added USD to test.

It would be because when you create a partial transaction from your paper wallet (spend 1.5 of 2 BTC), the other 0.5 would be sent to a change address. Since that change address wasn't generated by you but by the protocol (or the merchant's wallet), you don't have the private key for it.
@_date: 2014-11-13 17:20:06
For example, if I'm trying to send money to myself I may not care when the money is added to my other wallet, so I can choose to send a transaction with a 0 BTC fee. This may work, but could take hours to confirm and the bitcoins will be unspendable from either wallet until confirmation happens.
Bitcoin wallet for android has recently implemented a change to the way they handle fees and currently have it set to 10 bits (0.01 mBTC). That's around 0.004245 USD which in my opinion is nearly free and still gets confirmation in most cases over their tests.

That does seem to be true, it did make it into two blocks with the same number, but after delving into the advanced blockchain.info view, one of them was orphaned.

As far as I know that's sort of the way QR-Codes work (I'm no QR-Code expert), The data inside them is the same, but the QR-Code itself needs to change the location of the "bits" (heh) to maintain data integrity when the size of the QR-Code changes. If you have a smaller QR-Code 20px x 20px, and the same data in a QR-Code generated at 100px x 100px they will look different. 
Also with the request tab, you're putting new data into the QR-Code instead of just the address; the amount of money you would like to request is also included which is why it changes every time you make a change to that field.

I don't see how having more people using bitcoin would change the need for exchanges. Either people or exchanges are going to be charging high fees to get bitcoin. There's always going to be some sort of on-ramp somewhere, it may not be your onramp.
Unless you mean by mass adoption there will be a market flux and the cost of doing business will go down in person, I don't see why exchanges should or would change their model.

I think of it this way: Bitcoin is like cash in so far that you can only spend what you have, and it won't replace credit or loans. you can't do fractional reserve on a bitcoin unless you do it off chain, but then we can run into issues similar to bank runs, which we don't want. 
I think the best option would be to use loans in fiat and convert/pay in bitcoin. Or, if you'd rather not trust a banking system, The next best thing would be an inflationary crypto that does allow for fractional reserve.

You can add the separate addresses in blockchain by going to My Wallet&gt; Receive Money (and of course match against My Transactions) Remember that wallets are a collection of addresses, but you can still think of addresses as mini wallets "My wallet has a collection of bills, and each bill has this value" Of course my analogy breaks down when you assign new values to the bills.

You already provide a transaction fee to the miners to process your transaction. If the bitcoin network is widely accepted as some think at that point in the future, transaction fees should be larger (as there are many more transactions per block) than the block rewards currently.

I would say that's the case as well, you have the ability to claim/redeem the satoshis in the wallet at any point as long as you own the private key. 
A similar parallel would be: the bank "owns" the safety deposit box, as long as you can trust the bank and have the key, you have the ability to redeem the contents. But that has its own legal precedence and the analogy breaks down after that.

You could ask them to provide the transaction hash in the email after payment is sent and look that up in blockchain too.

Sure the government could still buy your votes, but in this way instead of saying 84% of the population has voted for so and so, you can see that it has been written to the blockchain that X number of people voted this way and Y number of people voted another way.

Bitcoin isn't suited well for loans in my opinion, but it can be done. On such a large scale in a bitcoin only world, the only solution would be to accept payment in service/goods that are deemed just as valuable. Isn't that what money is supposed to be about?

Example: If I buy something physical online, I need to give my address to ship things to. Therefore, when I make a payment my identity is now tied to that address.
Whether they choose to publish or use that information for their gain/malice is up to them, which is why you would ideally be mixing coins and using multiple addresses. Now, when you make a new address or send to another address after making the purchase, you become semi-anonymous again as they really have no way of identifying if you bought something else or transferred those coins.

Look at it this way: I'm an American citizen, I want to trade with BTC on registered exchanges. I can't very well go sign up with CaVirtex as I don't have ID that proves I'm Canadian. I could always give it to a Canadian I trust and say "put it on 300". but then they have my coins and can do what they wish.
The volumes on the other exchanges are lower (at least in the case of CaVirtex) and it would take much less than 30K to keep it there if that were the case.

"store of value" doesn't mean your value is static, only that it generally keeps its value (or rises). If I have $100 in bitcoin, since it is deflationary I expect it would generally always be worth around $100 or greater (assuming it doesn't go to zero).

That scenario is extremely hard to predict because it would mean the world basically ended overnight. Aside from that, If most are aware of BTC, there already would have been some price discovery and a transitional period. 
There would be people already pricing in bitcoins (like today) and those that aren't can either copy those that are depending on the goods, or set the bitcoin value of the value of currency yesterday and adapt over time to the "real" value of a bitcoin. There is no scenario where there is not some sort of transitional period.

Your point does have merit, but it really depends on how the network evolves. If everyone starts using mixers and mixed coins are as accepted as regularly transacted coins, then the freshly minted coins would be of the same value.

If you type in your seed it will ask you if you're trying to import the wallet with your ID 'f4Dc9g' or something which will match your paper backup. You should also make sure you're using the right wallet type (which it probably wouldn't start if this was wrong). If you've got this far and everything is correct you will have access to your bitcoins.
Once it's done checking the seed, it will begin the import. If you had sent any bitcoins to any addresses generated by the wallet they WILL be there. The only thing I can see causing an issue here is software malfunction which is usually solved by a rebuild/rescan of the databases or factory reset if you really believe your copy of the blockchain is corrupt.
 If you used the "import" function to import external addresses rather than sweeping the funds into a new address generated by the wallet, those addresses are not contained in your backup.

It does if they don't have to ship anything to your physical address or request your name/email/phone number. Otherwise you're tying a bitcoin address to your name. You would also need to make sure that your browser and/or IP isn't leaking any info about where or who you are.

The ledger does not store bitcoins just the private keys to transfer ownership.
The method used from wallet to wallet varies, but most new wallets are HD-compatible and can generate billions* of key pairs.
As far as the number of actual transactions that's infinite as well as the transactions aren't stored on the device but on the blockchain. The hardware wallet just queries the internet for the list of previous transactions. If it's able to show transactions AND balances offline as well I suppose there's some sort of internal memory/storage, but I don't know what the capacity would be.

What's trying to be said here is that you're trying to interface your bank(USD) with bitcoin and back to USD and expect there to be only the fees of bitcoin. 
The problem here is that the companies you are dealing with have to still deal with the banks when you deposit and withdraw fiat and that's where the higher fees are coming from. 
There are remittance services starting to come out that may help with the situation, but if you were to purely be doing it with bitcoin to your contractor's the fees will be lower.
Yes, not everyone accepts or has use for bitcoin at this time and has to change over to fiat, but if they didn't have to the fees would be a lot lower. Bitcoin is about being peer-to-peer and not having to deal with middlemen like exchanges or fiat at all once you're in the system. It gives you an alternative to using cash.

With bitcoin you're your own bank and you can become a target if someone knows you own a lot of bitcoin. However, with an ETF, bitcoins are not being held by you. If you're looking at bitcoin as an investment it's just as sound as holding them yourself. But if you're looking for an alternative currency etc, bitcoin fills that role as well.
TL;DR: an ETF will help people who are not ready to hold bitcoin themselves but want to use it as an investment.

I don't quite see the difference here, though. Virtex was using the branded BitAccess machines (as far as I can remember seeing).

Perhaps they ween't seeing as good a profit from the machine and decided to offset the cost by having someone else run it that has made it their job to deploy ATMs?

From what I gathered at Toronto in April, they help businesses adopt bitcoin and set them up with ATMs if they want. When Virtex placed their ATMs I doubt they were doing that and some of the businesses that hosted the ATMs were doing so more as a security measure and not because they were all that interested in accepting bitcoin in their store.
I assume BitSent will be taking them and pairing them up with their own customers.

For one bitcoin would moon, and then a lot of the other hodlers would sell, but then since the bank owns most of the bitcoin it would depend on what they did next. 
If they sell it all after pushing the price up it would crash the market to near zero and take forever to get the price back to "normal" levels and we may get a true value of what bitcoin is actually worth based on transactional value and minimal speculation as anyone still with bitcoin would be holding until they could either make a profit or got scared out of the market.
Miners would flood the system while the buys are taking place as mining bitcoin on a USB stick is suddenly profitable again until the difficulty pushes them out of the network.
Once the sell-off happens, miners will shut them off again and it could halt the system if they leave too quickly before the difficulty can adjust.

You want an app that will take payments natively within the software, using an API if necessary. In order to do that you need to understand your service that you're using and how to make remote calls within your app/server. Those are end-user developer solutions, it's hiding all the bitcoin logic behind their own servers and providing you with the data that is returned - it also doesn't care whether you use Android/iOS/Windows/Web. It will require knowledge of how to properly read JSON data regardless of the API you're using. 
Bitcoin is bigger than just taking payments and receiving payments, that's why you need to pick and choose your API calls - because the API that you're using also wants to serve users who need to do multisig/HD/transaction browsing/create wallets etc etc.

I was wondering if anyone knows of a mining pool that supports lightning at this time. Not for mining but rather allowing smaller pooled miners to receive payouts via lightning without having to hit a specific limit?
I bought a Bitmain R1 on a whim about 1-2 years back and has been running nonstop on PPLNS (cause that lottery just never seemed appealing) and still hasn't hit the minimum obviously. It probably averages 10-20sat a day now, but I was thinking I could get daily (or at least more frequent) payouts if a pool supported lightning and could output that with a millisat fee. Then I was thinking you could route that to slowly top up a lightning node.

Definitely not true math.
* buy $10 on the first of each month
* take the $7000 target and call that 2017-12-01
* average out the price increase over the 3 months before ($666/month)
* Since the $10,000 target is in 2018, push it out to May/June and average out the price increase again ($600/month)
* Repeat for $20,000 calling it 2018-12-01 ($1430/month)
* My dumb calculations put 30k in April 2022 ($250/month)
* $44k in Nov 2026 ($225/month)
* $100k in Jan 2028 ($4666/month)
* $200k in Dec 2028 ($9090/month)
* $325k in May 2029 ($25000/month) - mainly this is in May because the last target is $500k in 3030 which I would call Jan-01 ($21875/month)
So, all in all, pretty messy, not really math and very arbitrary. Based of those wonky numbers if I put $10 in each month at those averaged prices I get 0.05BTC ($25000 @ $500k/BTC)

The only thing I could say is that it is beta software, you can't guarantee something won't go wrong.

It is segwit and they knew the featureset was coming (or at least that it might be). So they have had some time to prepare and test.

An Antrouter mines 5.5GH/s at somewhere between 0-5W (I haven't measured it myself). I currently have it set up as part of a pool and making 5-10 satoshis per block. (about $0.04 a day, maybe $1/month at current prices)
However, by default this mines solo and you will not be making anything unless you're *really really really (x1000)* lucky. But if you do manage to find a block you'll make the entire 12.5BTC reward. I had been running solo for almost a year with no reward.
This has an ASIC chip in it which is more powerful than a graphics card, but it can only mine bitcoin, unless you mess around with the firmware to have it mine other SHA256 cryptos. With a graphics card you would mainly be looking at altcoins, because you'll make even less than nothing with bitcoin.

I believe the second calculation is more correct. Poloniex lending bot calculates APR for bitcoin at 10.341% currently. Of course, it is variable based on the amount of completing trades.
A recent trade I had was 0.05382759 BTC @ 0.0243% for 4 hours duration. Payout was 200 satoshis minus bot fee.
0.05382759 * 0.000243 = 0.00001308 per 24 hours
0.00001308 * 0.16̅6 (4 hours out of 24) ≈ 0.00000209 which is close to my payout.

Your wallet tells you what the fees are before you even hit send. It calculates the fee based on the size of the transactions, and most wallets now also do some dynamic fee magic where they look at the network and see how long a fee of that size will take to confirm and call that low/econo/normal/priority. 
The problem with this is that if the transaction is larger and the network is sufficiently backlogged your midrange fee can still come out to 2% ( and it might still take forever).

The address itself can be used as cryptographic proof. you can sign a message and put it on your site (or as part of your transaction flow) and your users can verify that you have control of the address. You could even codify the message for each user so it's different, or have the user send a secret message on their own so they don't have to trust your signing code on your webpage isn't broken, and the signature would still validate.
"Thanks for your purchase from XYZ Store! Please send 0.0001 bitcoins to 1CnU5NjK1qnW4vZbA7ZSBvz6JhAQGVHeRs. You entered a secret code for validation of this message:Ando is great - Please use your bitcoin wallet to verify this message and signature with the address to verify that we control the funds."

Now, if you don't trust the code on this webpage, there could still be a MITM attack and the address and signature could still be changed before you receive it. But this way you can validate that whoever sent you the message has control of the bitcoin address. But if the address in the message doesn't match the address from your transaction then you know something's up.

While cloud mining in itself isn't a scam - hopefully they are at least paying out to a wallet you control, you have no idea if they actually have the hashing power that they say they do. 
Let's say you're on their 15 TH/s for $1950. If you had used this yourself (an Antminer S9 at 11-14TH was about $1350) you would be making around $8-10 a day minus electricity. While the profits will go down eventually the block reward is still 12.5 bitcoins for the next 4 years. If indeed it is a lifetime contract and you can't get out of it, who's to say they won't keep charging your estate while simultaneously renting out that same hashpower to some new miners and also somehow paying them? (looking into the website and there is a maintenance fee but the upfront cost of the miner is one-time)
This is mostly where cloud mining becomes a scam. If they're paying out twice for one set of miners, eventually they won't have enough mining power to pay everyone that rents that one box, so they either buy or say they're buying more hardware. You'll be paying maintenance fees which will soon eclipse any reward you would receive and have no guarantee that they'll continue to pay out. Unless, of course, the value of bitcoin goes up and suddenly your 0.02 bitcoins are worth $100.

at $0.12/kWh just my little router costs $0.17 a month if power averages to 2W. $0.34 if 4W (haven't measured it yet). That's 10-20% of your earnings going to hydro. 
Also I find USB sticks to run really hot (I had 5 and they were hitting like 150C+), so you're going to want a fan of some sort.
If you do manage to get into the bigger options, you're looking at 40-50% of your earnings going to hydro.

Easiest, Time Consuming - 1 Giant Spreadsheet, 5? cols (bought, sold, price, cost basis, and btc left) - Each selling line is a cost basis calculation and would need to be taxed on that amount. The BTC left column is a doozy though because you need to keep track of how many coins are left at the price you bought them for FIFO/LIFO and complicates things further. The easiest way to not muddle things up is to make a large purchase first before spending anything that will cover all your expenditures and account for dips in the price.

You can use a USB-OTG cable to connect your Trezor to your mobile if your device supports it. 
Mycelium does support it, and you can import your account to check the balance and receive coins, and send if the Trezor is connected. You would want to make sure you select the Trezor account type and enter your PIN during the setup (importing your seed is the wrong way to do it).

cgminer and sgminer are not mining pools. They connect to mining pools using the account information you set up with them, I would assume much the same way nicehash does.
If you are using nicehash with only your laptop, all you are doing at this point is burning electricity and your CPU for the amount of bitcoin you are receiving. 
You really should use a mining calculator and find out how much you pay for electricity in your area to calculate your profit and get some more information about how nicehash calculates your profits if indeed it is a pool.

fees are calculated per byte (and can also be influenced what's confirming on the network, if you can't set your own fee). If you don't know how large the transaction is then the sat/byte for normal could end up being $3 or $80 (but mycelium tells you both how large the transaction is and what your sat/byte is.
Currently their rates are:
* Low-priority ~235sat/byte
* Economy ~283sat/byte
* Normal ~381sat/byte
* Priority ~466sat/byte
Still pretty insane if you ask me. We need to disregard what the wallets are doing and keep sending as low as possible so the wallets readjust. Of course, this may have the side effect of the miners refusing to choose any transactions for a while until game theory kicks in and they start competing for the new fee tiers.
I just sent a very large transaction to my trezor's segwit address and on mycelium the fee would have been $50-135 with it's predetermined fee rates. I imported the seed to electrum instead and sent it for 30sat/byte - it still cost $10.

Your crypto did have a USD price as well. Let's say you bought 1 bitcoin for $10 (to keep it simple). Your crypto is tied to bitcoin and is worth 0.01 bitcoin per unit when you buy it ($0.10), but the bitcoin price dropped to $9 a day later. Your crypto is worth 0.01 bitcoin ($0.09) when you sell and incur a capital loss.

I'm not extremely well versed on the mempool, but there is a possibility it will be dropped from the network but it is impossible to say if and when it would happen.
It should get confirmed eventually. Bitcoinfees is pretty accurate and does update fairly frequently so you'd be able to see if there are a lot more transactions that come in and increase your confirmation time.

If viruses and malware are a concern the wallet you use is the least of your worries. MITM attacks can happen in any wallets under any operating system. I would not recommend an SPV wallet as malicious servers are a possibility. 
If you can spare the disk space for a full node I would recommend [Armory]( - it does have a ton of features and the UI can be simplified or made more advanced if you ever need it. Make sure you choose a good wallet passphrase and print or write down the backup when it asks you to.
As an alternative you could use a hardware wallet like Trezor and keep your coins on that and use a wallet as an interface to it so your coins aren't stored on the computer.

1. When a miner completes a block and it is added to the network they are awarded the 12.5 bitcoins(currently) as a reward for their work. This bitcoin, since it is the same at the rest of the bitcoin, it inherits the value of the other bitcoins on the market. (if someone mines a chunk of gold by hand, doesn't it have the same amount of value as the rest of the gold on the market?)
2. It is supposed that by that time (year 2140 or so) that if Bitcoin still exists it may have a rather large value and the transaction fees paid to the miners will rival the existing block reward (or surpass it).
3. If there were no miners validating transactions and adding blocks to the network bitcoin would have no value. Mining is voluntary and must be rewarded for their work which is what the block reward and transaction fees are for. If you didn't get paid for mining, imagine how few miners would be on the network today.
4. I believe the block hash is a hash of all the transactions included in it plus a predetermined amount of leading zeroes based off of a specific function. Someone else may be better able to answer this question, I haven't gone too deep into the anatomy of transactions myself.

Sounds like instead of doing all that you might just want to use a tumbler. When dealing with paper wallets you're going to be sweeping the whole paper wallet (otherwise it will go to a change address you don't know) to multibit and have to create another for receiving again.
The other option would be to use a hardware wallet or wallet on an offline device (an old phone/computer etc.) for receiving your savings (and that way you can automatically have new receiving addresses increasing your privacy and when you want to spend send them to a tumbler (maybe using several cycles) that would forward to your multibit. When going back to the offline wallet use a different tumbler so that your transactions aren't all going through the same one.

There's no doubt that it is decentralized. [If your bitsquare node is not online, your trades aren't either]( You don't have to use it all the time if you can get cheaper coins somewhere else, but keeping an offer on either side is probably a good practice to entice other new users.

It's not completely useless as you can still plug it in and check the address for coins before accepting it, but that does make a little more hassle than it's worth. And the fact that the private key is exposed, so you'd have to sweep it anyway.

Bank Account/Exchange - While your balance may be $1M on your bank account, you cannot trust that your bank has or will be able to provide you with all or any of that amount at a given time.
Cold Storage - You control the keys, so you know you have $1M and can send that $1M wherever you like at any time, no questions asked.
As for the concept of bitcoin addresses vs unique names, bitcoin addresses *are* unique, a human is extremely disadvantaged when it comes to generating randomness or uniqueness by hand. While bitcoin addresses may be hard for humans to remember, the blockchain allows you to trust that you sent coins from whatever addresses you own - whether it was you or not.
If your bitcoin was stolen, human-readable names wouldn't help much because the thief would try to mask their identity anyway and seeing that it came from your name doesn't change the fact that it left your wallet. You can still look up the specific wallet address it left from on the blockchain and trace it that way.

Theoretically you can take an app that writes to a file called wallet.dat and save it to /media/sdcard (at least on android) and do that. But it would most likely be a fork of an existing wallet if you want that functionality. I don't know of any that allow you to modify the storage location of the wallet itself.
Once you have the backup that's really all you need to recreate the wallet. It sounds like you're looking for a wallet file that you can run off a microSD and then transfer it to your computer for a hardware wallet type solution. You would need to have your mobile wallet file able to be read by the desktop program as well for the purposes of signing and sending.

Yes, you wouldn't really be getting too much more anonymity if you're not mixing your coins before sending to the third wallet anyway. Your copay wallet would still be linked to the tor wallet in that case. But what you could do is set up your third wallet on a different tor connection and do something like this:
If you're using an exchange you want to get your coins as far away from the exchange before hitting tor. So you essentially want to go Exchange-&gt;Copay-&gt;Other clearnet wallet-&gt;Mixer-&gt;tor wallet-&gt;tor wallet
1. Create a second clearnet wallet (blockchain etc for plausible deniability "I paid that person")  and send your copay coins there
2. Connect your computer to Tor (using the browser or TAILS so your IP/location is hidden)
3. Create a wallet in electrum (you need to have the tor browser open or using tails before you create your electrum wallet or else it will be linked to your IP)
4. Create a new identity in the tor browser to get a new IP and create a third wallet using blockchain (it has an onion too) or some other reputable wallet service
5. Disconnect from tor
6. Connect to bitmixer using clearnet and send from wallet 2 to Mixer to wallet 3
7. Connect to tor again and send from wallet 3 to electrum
Pretty involved, but this is an almost secure way as far as i understand it.
You could probably get rid of the third wallet and go from mixer to electrum, but you probably should still have that second clearnet wallet in the mix.

You're not dealing with bitcoin YET - you're still stuck on the on-ramp and dealing with government money which requires this information. This is not the case with bitcoin, but only once you _have_ bitcoin. 
As many have said - the exchanges require this information because of governments, not because of bitcoin. And while some do look shady there are many that are reputable - they just aren't on Paypal scale and so they don't have the network effect it does.
The point of bitcoin (once you have it) is that you're control of your money. You can receive and send at your leisure with no documents between parties, no freezing of accounts (as long as you're using a wallet that resides on your device and not with a service).
Honestly if you're in a developed nation there's just so many choices that there really is no reason to use bitcoin (unless you're doing something shady or want some extra privacy that paypal and banks can't give you). However, you are going to be creating accounts and releasing all the same information that the exchanges require because they deal with government money.

Most new wallets are HD compatible. This means that every time you want to receive a payment it generates an address for you. You do end up with a lot of addresses, but this will be mitigated by the fact when you do make an outgoing payment it will gather enough bitcoin from as many addresses as needed. 
As a side note when you send from any address in most wallets it generates a change address for you anyway which you don't know until it's generated (if there's anything left over)
If you do set up a public bitcoin address you can use it to receive all your payments, but it does end up hurting your financial privacy in the end as everyone would be able to see all your incoming and outgoing payments as you have mentioned.
The way to mitigate this risk would be forwarding incoming payments from this address to a new address you control or using a mixer to do that for you to break the chain.
Bitcoin wallet is secure because you can encrypt it with a password on your device and if the wallet file is stolen it couldn't be recovered unless they have your decryption password.

ShakePay is good and most like Samsung Pay (with NFC), but it is separate and does not link to the existing Samsung Pay wallet. However, Shake does give you access to the digital card details, so you may be able to import it. 
But even so you are using funds that you've converted from BTC to USD etc. Shake is not a true BTC wallet (yet) but enables you to use your bitcoins at places you would not be able to normally.

Wallet recovery in Electrum comes from the software itself and is not stored anywhere other than your device and that piece of paper. When you type in the words to recover the wallet the software rebuilds the keys you need to access any remaining funds or use the wallet as normal.

No. A cheque is a piece of paper that says "the person on the cheque can deposit this and get cash in their account". You cannot give that cheque to someone else and have them deposit it at their bank because it's not written to them.
This is what bitwage et al attempt to address. You are telling your employer to pay bitwage (instead of you) and bitwage (or whoever) will deposit bitcoins in your wallet (and/or send the rest to your bank).

It allows you to prove you have access to the address. Sort of like PGP for money. If I have a website where I'm anonymous and I have a donation address  listed somewhere on it, and someone asks me to prove that is the correct address I can do so. Then you can use the verify process with my signature, message and address to verify that the message was signed with my donation address' private key.
"My website is p660R.com (not really) and my donation address is listed on my contact page as 1CnU5NjK1qnW4vZbA7ZSBvz6JhAQGVHeRs"
I can sign this message without the quotes using that address and get the signature H54zwMCGzjvaIf8cAQVVlDlZUO8CT5BWAMt1/pQG+gKnf8BrxHOHuhS8usbwn41kyhE3K9aZwziJDYRK1ClwAJE=
When you go to your sign/verify option and enter my address and the message and the signature, your wallet can verify I signed that message with the private key for 1CnU5NjK1qnW4vZbA7ZSBvz6JhAQGVHeRs and that I have control of the funds going to that address.
EDIT: You can try changing the message or signature and the signature will fail to validate. This way you know the message or signature or address was modified before you received it and should be wary of trusting that message.

Do you know what coins you're mining? Are you using the NiceHash Miner program? it automatically switches coins if you're using CPU/GPU and some might have a higher price at the moment. Do you have any links to how NiceHash calculates your earnings? Your pool or whatever it is says payout ratio is 0.0015 per 24 hours. There's no way that your devices make that much, so I don't know what they're paying you in. Could be some sort of token, but if it is bitcoin they could be diving the shares among all the people on the pool.

It doesn't matter how many bitcoins are available. Even if you divide all the bitcoins ever among one quarter of the people on the planet there's only enough to give everyone about 0.012 bitcoins. Even if bitcoins aren't a significant portion of the store of value in the future, one would argue that that amount of bitcoin should be worth more than $8.50 when it could be a good be a good portion of savings or transactional volume.
Going towards the previous point the number of miners can be infinite, but only one miner finds a block and is rewarded. In the current situation with pools you're not really mining but lending your hashpower to one large miner and they're giving you a share of their profits - otherwise you wouldn't be making anything unless you were really lucky. 
The transaction fees and block reward aren't being divided by ALL the miners in the network at a given time, just the one that found the block. It's up to that miner to distibute the reward to any extra participants that helped them find the block. 
What you're describing seems to be a 51% attack (all miners colluding to get all the rewards) and last time that got close to happening a lot of people switched their pool for the sake of the network.

No, if you're using the clearnet site (because you're not using orfox or a tor browser on your phone) then the onion won't work anyway.
You could send your transaction to the clearnet site and have the receiving address be the tor wallet. Then if you're sending from the TOR wallet I would connect with the onion link using a TOR enabled browser.
But if the wallets are both on your phone then there wouldn't be an issue with using your tor browser on the phone  to connect and send the bitcoins using the onion address. But that way you might lose plausible deniability.

I don't believe there is any way to truly determine a limiting factor of nodes because they are so easy to replicate.
If you are determined to use full nodes to set the block size, I can't see any way to make this viable as full nodes are software and software can be replicated infintely. The operational cost to run a full node is only limited by the amount of bandwidth a node can take advantage of (and RAM/CPU). 
Since you can't really poll these systems for how much RAM or CPU they have this information would have to be submitted voluntarily and verified somehow. In this scenario this information could also be faked (unless the verification process is foolproof, in which case you'd be able to do this with any computer connected to the internet, not just bitcoin nodes).
@_date: 2016-11-03 19:23:21
The block size would remain the same, but the witness data is offset to a separate structure that old nodes can't see. AFAIK this allows for  more transactions to be included in the main block as long as most nodes upgrade. they would see blocks smaller than 1MB because a lot of the data is stored as witness data in Segwit

They got the software from [NiceHash]( But I'm unsure how their payouts work, it definitely *should* be $0.00. Mining with 5GH should get you around  20 satoshis a block, and CPU/GPU combined might get a tenth of that, most likely less.

It _can't_ just be technical because it requires consensus. Consensus means voting, which means politicism. As much as the bitcoin network itself doesn't align with any political values and you are free to use it however you like, upgrades to the system will require near-unanimous support otherwise you end up with multiple chains that don't agree with each other and have something similar to ETH/ETC
At the end of the day this is what the debate is all about - both sides are trying to get people behind the implementation they think will do the least harm to the network in the long run.

Don't forget that the transaction fee on the exchange works both ways.
Buy 1 BTC @ 768 USD + 1.49% = 11.49 fee
Sell 1 BTC @ 1011 CAD + 0.5% (Quadriga) = 5.00 fee
It's a bit cheaper in terms of fees (but not by much, could be more expensive depending on transfer methods), but you might have to wait on each end for transfers. Plus any potential taxes at year-end on each transfer.
Choices for Canadians are Kraken, Quadriga, LocalBitcoins, ATMs, and Mycelium Local Trader/Glidera supported wallets (Copay/Bitpay/Airbitz). There are probably more.
Once you're in Bitcoin, it's really just cheaper to keep it in bitcoin if possible. But of course that's not always the case and that's where the fees come in.

To be fair, now that I think about it the bitcoin unit should be satoshis otherwise you could just move the decimal place around as it goes up or down. Maybe bitcoin is the best unit to use, but this goes back to the public's view of "I can't buy a whole bitcoin" Which I've heard a lot and tried to explain using USD or EUR exchange rates.
If we go the other way and use satoshis, it might be a better perception, but at what amount of precision becomes "too high" or "too low"? 
What would be the best way to calculate "pure" 1:1 exchange rates seeing as most sites use the BTC unit to calculate?
@_date: 2016-12-16 15:35:18
All you need to worry about is how your wallet (and the other wallet) generates the master seed and child addresses. All other private/public pairs are derived from this. It would be the same as colliding with a regular address. 
if you're using seed *m* and derive m/0'/0 as your first address the only collision you need would be *m* to get all the other addresses to collide (m2/0'/0 would be equal) so there's no difference to any other bitcoin collision.
@_date: 2016-12-19 19:50:15
If the number of nodes determines the block size, it doesn't take into account the connection those nodes run on. Increased decentralization does not mean all nodes can handle more traffic. All full nodes still need to verify all the transactions. 
Fake nodes can be created increasing the node count to make pushes to higher block sizes and force users who can't handle the bandwidth off the network and cripple it (at a worst-case scenario).
Even if all bitcoiners support the same way to increase the block size, node count is a very poor way to determine what the new limit should be.

Sort of, the onion/clearnet thing doesn't really change the operation of your bitcoin wallet or the website. it's more of a privacy thing based on which browser you're using.
If you're using the TOR browser on your computer with electrum, you can connect to bitmixer using their onion address and scan the the QR Code or address and send safely from your copay wallet using that. It will still send the bitcoins on the network, just that copay will still send the transaction to the bitcore wallet server (bitpay's if you haven't set up your own). If you're not using the TOR browser you can use the clearnet site without any change to the operation of the site.
So when you send from copay it will be on clearnet regardless of the browser you're using on your computer, then when it hits the network and gets picked up by bitmixer they will send to the address in electrum and you will have coins you can safely spend on the tor network.
bitcoin and tor don't actually operate together, but it does enhance your privacy by changing your IP and location periodically based off your exit nodes.

Some people who use bitcoin in the real world may not care about appreciation at a later date and would rather spend it now as a currency than a store-of-value hybrid. 
For example if I get 100% of my income in bitcoin I may be the kind of person who doesn't want (or can't be) in the banking system and would rather not deal with credit cards at all. But since most of the retailers I deal with don't accept bitcoin directly I opt to use a bitcoin debit card instead.

AFAIK once the implementation of lightning is complete it will be semi-centralized in the fact that to be very effective there should only be a small number of lightning hubs. To be fair, "small" in this case would probably be anywhere from 100-1000.
That's not to say everyone can't run a hub - the software has been tested by multiple companies running their own implementations and one could be released open source (I haven't checked) - but if everyone is running a hub, no one is routing through the hubs so what's the point?
EDIT: Counter-point to my point: If lightning is open-sourced, then everyone _can_ run a hub, but you would have to make sure that your hub is competitive with nearby hubs in terms of fees (and speed, if applicable). I would imagine if this were the case someone would make a website that would crawl the lightning nodes (or it would become part of the LN server/client) and display to the user which Lightning nodes would be most economical for the amount of bitcoin they're transacting. You'd want to make sure of course that the hub would have enough bitcoin locked in to allow for your coins to come in and out of the network when you want them to.

Build a document with some or all private keys and encrypt it with PGP. You could split it up and use different keypairs to limit access. Store that file on Lastpass and that way you have dual or triple auth (LP master pass, PGP Password, LP 2FA). You could also set the document to require LP master pass on opening.
This way if lastpass is hacked they would need to get your PGP passphrase(s) as well.

You cannot use blockchain to look up an xpub because an xpub is a wallet in itself (technically). You need to use the tool to go through the addresses in the xpub using the proper derivation (see the derviations at the bottom which show the addresses).
**Please don't provide the mnemonic**, but I could give a little more information if I know what wallet you're trying to use or how you created the xpub and the derivation (m/0/0 etc)
EDIT: Actually, it looks like you can look up an xpub in blockchain. If you don't see anything in the transactions, you're probably using the wrong derivation (and possibly the wrong xpub) as there can be children which also have their own xpub. This also depends on if the mnemonic is correct.

However, since the upgrade to SegWit, if you're using the new Trezor firmware or beta wallet and have your coins in a SegWit wallet mycelium won't find them, because they're looking at the legacy BIP44 account, and not the new BIP49 Segwit one. But they're still on the Trezor.
You should still be able to use Trezor with mycelium, it would just be a legacy account. ~~*WARNING* I haven't tested this yet, and I can't guarantee that Trezor will continue to support BIP44 accounts.~~ It is very likely there won't be a problem, transactions from that wallet just won't be using SegWit.

The master extended public key (xpub) is the key used to generate all your receiving addresses. It cannot be used to return your funds, because it does not generate the corresponding private keys.
The encrypted private key is the one you want. if you have that and the password you encrypted it with, you should be able unencrypt the file to get access to the key to sweep your bitcoins into a new wallet.
See the [Coinkite blog post]( for information that might help you retrieve your funds.

As a Canadian, I'm still having trouble understanding what the US considers chequing and credit. It seems intertwined in an impossible way. I have a US card that is tied to my "checking" account, but I can also use it as a credit card? How can I use the money I have but also spend money I don't on the same account? 
In Canada, usually you have a debit card which has a useless account number for the bank that takes money out of the account, and a separate card with the visa info for credit. 
We have started getting visa debit which I would liken to the American system, but it's not in wide use yet.

I don't really know how a blockchain would get rid of an ISP. They manage the lines and take payments from their customers. That's really the basics of it. 
I could see a crypto in it's current state defining pay-per-use bandwidth on top of TOR so you pay each of your relays for their bandwidth used. But that can be done already with current tech.
You can't get rid of an ISP that's able to monitor the lines they own and all the traffic on it unless every bit of traffic is encrypted end-to-end and not intercepted along the way.

There is no IF, it's just impossible - it's coded so that there are never more than 21 million (except in that one special case). If someone had changed bitcoin to be 30 million, depending on when and who changed the code people would know about it long before the last coin is mined and there would be a fork. Then we'd have 21-million-coin and 30-million-coin. People would choose which chain they want to use just like BCH or any other altcoin (this is barring any other technical difficulties that may arise).

support.keepkey.com looks to be a Snapshot instance. Usually when sites implement it, you click the logo or whatever they don't bring you to the main page, and redirects back to the "home page" for support.
support and help are both subdomains that redirect to their helpdesk.
When it asks you to do an update it's probably because the firmware it shipped with is older than the one that has been most recently released.See [this ticket]( for your answer (or the one from [help.keepkey.com](
EDIT: They do look different and the certificates are differently issued (Keepkey for help, and  for support) - so they may be different, though I thought that since KeepKey owns the domain keepkey.com, they can implement whatever subdomains they want.

If you're arbitraging the same currency for example USD it's possible, but you'd want to hold bitcoin and fiat on both sides so you're not wasting time transferring money back and forth. Also you need to take into account the fees and calculate based off that too.
BITFINEX: btc - 0.01 usd - $100

When available, you should always use 2FA and an authenticator app. The wallet should ask for your 2FA when logging in or sending coins in most cases, preferably both. If you saved your backup insecurely, they could have gotten access to that as well.

It's hard to speculate. High-end computers will always be high-end, and there will be hardware out of the reach of Joe Schmoe. If technology keeps advancing as long as the mining algorithm doesn't change it may hold true. 
But that also means that the people that can afford the high-end things will buy them and push Joe out of the market again. But at least it could be more decentralized.
EDIT: Now that I'm thinking a little more, what I meant by that last statement is that the holders of all the high end things would be more like the mining warehouses we have today (your VISA), but a bunch of other pools would show up with a lot more users competing for the transaction fees.

IANAL, but you should be recording each transaction in order and calculating capital gains after each sell, because the capital gains would be different for each. 
If you buy 0.01 and only sell half @ $3790, then buy 0.01 @ $3775 and sell it all @ $3800, you have to do capital gains on the $30 increase of the first transaction, and the $40 increase for the remaining of the first buy, and $25 increase on the second sell.

I hope that's not a real seed. If it is, you'll want to move the coins immediately. But this part explains how it's done: 


bits of its SHA256 hash. This checksum is appended to the end of the initial entropy. Next, these concatenated bits are split into groups of 11 bits, each encoding a number from 0-2047, serving as an index into a wordlist. Finally, we convert these numbers into words and use the joined words as a mnemonic sentence. The following table describes the relation between the initial entropy length (ENT), the checksum length (CS) and the length of the generated mnemonic sentence (MS) in words."
The checksum is always in the last position depending on the amount of entropy you're using (12, 15, 18, 21, 24 words)

They will not and cannot move if the owner of the keys did not give them out before or upon their death. The blockchain doesn't care about the coins, but it's recorded in the ledger that this address has control of them. It's just never going to be spent.

You're not exactly mining bitcoin with nicehash, but altcoins - that is, you're not securing the bitcoin blockchain. You get paid by nicehash in bitcoins when you reach a certain threshold I believe.

And that's where I fail to see the distinction. If a debit card can be used as credit, why does the merchant care if I'm using debit or credit in the US? Do they not decline your card if you go over your limit? isn't that the same as if you couldn't pull money out of debit because of NSF?
EDIT: Okay, so debit can be used as credit until you can't take any money out of your account. Then you would use your credit-only card with limit X and as long as you have a balance available it works. Makes sense, I guess. But that still doesn't explain the whole "merchants asking if I'm paying with credit" if every card can be used like a credit card.

It takes ENT bits of entropy generated by your device between 128-256 bits. Then the checksum is created by taking ENT/32 bits of its SHA256 hash. Place this at the end of of ENT. Then you split it into 11-bit sequences where each represents a number from 0-2047. From these sequences you can created the words for your seed.
See [BitcoinJS BIP39 Implementation]( for an idea of how it's created. This is how they create the checksum:
    function deriveChecksumBits (entropyBuffer) {
        var ENT = entropyBuffer.length * 8
        var CS = ENT / 32
        var hash = createHash('sha256').update(entropyBuffer).digest()
        return bytesToBinary([].slice.call(hash)).slice(0, CS)

Yes, it would keep deflating, but the bitcoin is just a token and can be revalued or decimal places added. 
As a hypothetical situation, imagine there is only 1000 satoshis in existence and there were no decimal places left. if it needed to be divided further the precision could be increased so that instead of 0.00001000 bitcoins you have 0.000010000000 bitcoins. Another way to say it: now you have 10000000 "new satoshis" (or whatever you want to call it)
After all the bitcoins are mined (far off into the future) it is believed that transaction fees would take over to incentivise the miners instead. If the network scales properly instead of having 5000 transactions per block (not a real estimate) you would have 1 million and the fees paid are theoretically to be larger than the block rewards.

From my previous usage, it looks to be anywhere up to about 2-3GB a day on the upload at the moment, under 1 is more common though. I doubt more nodes will reduce the upload requirement as each node still needs all/most/some of the transactions. You could probably limit your upload by only broadcasting certain transactions, but then it technically wouldn't be a full node anymore.

see 
I'm working on something similar with BIP44 wallets, Basically what's happening there is that bitcore generates the seed m (hdPrivateKey in example) and from it derives the extended private key for m/44'/0'/0'/0/1337.
What this does is it specs it to a BIP44 wallet, which is just a fine-tuned BIP32 wallet. I'm not sure if Multibit uses the same BIP32 paths as described in the image you posted so without knowing the source or paths it uses I couldn't say which you need. That image just shows that you can have wallets of wallets that contain addresses when using HD wallets if you wanted.
You should try to read the [BIP32]( article, mainly look at how it describes paths. I don't know everything about how it works, but Andreas' book definitely has a good chapter on it.

The VM gets the internet connection from the host computer and queries the blockchain for the amounts stored in the wallet. 
Copay and the 12-word seed only rebuild the wallet and addresses you've used and cannot get amounts without an internet connection. If copay were to go out of business and/or stop doing updates you would still be able to use old versions of the wallet or a wallet compatible with the seed.

Nothing would solve that problem. If someone looks like they have money, someone will try to take it. If they only find a small amount undoubtedly they would wonder where the rest is. Plausible deniability doesn't work well in your scenario because the victim is already known to be affluent and holding bitcoins, unless the victim can convince whoever it is that that's all they have - which may or may not have success.
However. plausible deniability may work in a situation where you hold a sum of bitcoins and "lose" or "have you phone stolen" and have the bitcoins transferred to another account or forget about your wallet and "accidentally" wipe your phone. You don't necessarily have to be rich or look rich for this to work either.
This is why it's better to not disclose that you own bitcoin (or any wealth, for that matter)
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:28:59
You don't have to physically transport the pen drive to everyone on the network. Remember that bitcoin is a peer to peer network and the only thing that matters is the broadcast of a transaction. 
A pen drive or CD of the same thing as a radio signal etc, in the fact that the data contained within is no different. As long as you can send binary or hex it doesn't matter how you send it.
In your pen drive example the act of me making a transaction sending coins from me to you and signing it and giving you the pen drive constitutes a transaction from start to finish. You can do this with any medium you want as long as the other party can broadcast it on to the network. Then it is recorded on the blockchain as if you sent it from an internet connected wallet. 
Remember that transactions don't require the internet to function properly, but it is extremely important for the verification and writing to the blockchain ( probably the most important function)

I think part of the innovation thing aside from recent events is Ethereum really brought out Smart Contracts into the forefront, and what's not to love about "smart" anything nowadays? Sure, Bitcoin is Smart Money, and it had the *potential* to do a lot more, but other than *making* money, money itself gets boring after a while.
That's not to say all the use cases for bitcoin I've seen over the years aren't exciting, but all I remember from bitcoin itself is exchanges and sending payments.

If you're just talking about bitcoin-only it could be possible but would probably require use of proof-of-reputation burn addresses. 
As far as the app itself (i assume it would be an app) you'd need to store some kind of location information to transfer over p2p but because it would be a quick transaction and don't really need proof that someone is asking for a ride, you don't need to be storing that information in a blockchain. 
However, you should verify that the request is valid and not modfied/forged so maybe a blockchain could be useful in this regard as well.
-reputation could be tracked via proof-of-reputation through burn addresses, this way you don't need to rely on third-parties. I haven't been looking into systems like this, so I'm unsure if there's a better system out there.
-payment channels could be utilized along with GPS/time data to charge a predetermined amount per km/mi
that's about all I can think of for now.

They both have their place and may be a safe bet (relative to bitcoin). Litecoin has faster confirmation times and Ethereum does smart contracts. When or if bitcoin gets smart contracts and lightning/side chains and rootstock (RSK is it's own token), depending on how well it's implemented we might see these coins' benefits rolled into bitcoin.
I've not used either extensively myself though.

What you seem to be talking about is flagging for support of specific features. There is no need to release a whole new implementation because it will follow the same rules as bitcoin core. This way Coinbase runs bitcoin core and sets a flag or comment for a specific feature.
If Coinbase were to fork the bitcoin code and release their own node and rules, it could cause a fork and you would have bitcoin on one fork, and Coinbase-bitcoin on another. These coins would be incompatible with each other if the Coinbase node is too restrictive.
Imagine everyone shared the Linux kernel and Canonical wanted to add a new feature, but Debian wanted to add another. Then imagine these changes are incompatible, and you kind of get why multiple implementations are a bad idea.

There seems to be a disconnect with what you're saying to me. If Coinbase is not enforcing new rules, why make the changes at all? If that have to get community support for the rules they want to use, they can submit a BIP and get support behind it and have it added to core.
Or if they do code, they can submit a pull request and have it merged.

No, they are all trades within that interval at any point along the body and wick. At time 00:00 a new candle is created. Once a trade executes it becomes the new open (body). Then within that minute 100 trades execute (there's a lot of bots active today ;) ) the high, low and close are all trades that completed in that minute. Any other trades are shown anywhere along the candle at any point along the body or wick. But the candle doesn't show specific trade amount information other than the four mentioned.

As far as your edit goes, you can thik of it more like having your whole balance in pennies. You take all the pennies out of your left pocket, place them on the table and split them into piles. The pile you're not spending can either go back into your left or right pocket. Each pile is then counted as an output.

Since the code can be run offline, I suppose it's doing all the hashing in the JavaScript. Since it's not relying on a node for key generation it should be as safe as rolling dice. The code shouldn't care which implementation of bitcoin you're going to be using.
However, the problem becomes where the coins are coming from - are you sending BIP148 coins or not to the wallet? Doing one or the other will lock that wallet to the chain the coins came from after a split (at least, that's how I understand it).

Someone else may be able to give a more detailed description of the issues themselves, but depending on how it all shakes out as long as you buy and hold there shouldn't be much of a difference as long as you wait for it to calm down afterwards. 
Risks come from if there is a chain split and you're transferring between chains, you might get stuck on a chain that you don't want. That being said, my advice for first-timers is usually this:
* Don't buy more than you're comfortable with losing. We're all hopeful that bitcoin will CHANGE THE WORLD, but no one really knows how the price will go. 
* Along with point 1, if you're holding try not to make emotional decisions. We've seen it go from $1000 to $200
* Dollar cost averaging is a good strategy if you're looking to trade or hold long term and may sell during that period. It can help minimize losses because instead of buying $1000 in one day, you're spreading that over weeks or months.

The way the VPN works is that you're connecting to the VPN and the traffic you send through is encrypted. if you're using the VPN on your home network, the service would still have access to the IP you're coming from if they were to ever need it.
Using the VPN service is more about hiding your true location and the information you send across the internet from your ISP and the sites you visit than the VPN provider themselves.

If you're trading it for goods and services barter rules apply. If you're trading with other currencies, capital gains apply. Until Canada formally recognizes bitcoin as a currency/commodity in situations where capital gains applies and marks it as a registered investment, looks like you're out of luck.

The price comes from what people think bitcoin is worth. If only Satoshi and Hal were the only users of bitcoi in the beginning Satoshi says "1 BTC is worth 0.01" and Hal says "OK", the price of one bitcoin is 0.01. 
Over time, as new users enter the ecosystem, some will be willing to pay more or less based on supply/demand/personal thought. That is where the fluctuations come from.
Obviously this is very oversimplified, but the market rate is set by the users and what other users are willing to pay for it.

Your bitcoins aren't going from 1 to 0.5 when the halving occurs. Miners add transactions to the network every 10 minutes and are awarded 25 bitcoins currently for doing so. At the halving the rate of bitcoin production drops from 25 per 10 minutes to 12.5 per 10 minutes. You'll still have 1 bitcoin after the halving, but the miners receive less afterwards.

Hard to say as I've not used one before, but I would think they should be relatively liquid with the following caveats - you  have to contact your broker to sell, there may be a minimum hold policy (in days, weeks, months) among others. 
But technically the price should be a little more stable because they're only operating on stock exchange hours and the relative difficulty of selling puts little pressure on the sell side. You would generally be using ETF if you plan on holding for a longer period of time and to **avoid** risk of price volatiliy. But it all depends on how fast the broker is allowing you to convert your shares in the ETF.
This is what the chart looks like for GBTC and Bitcoin Tracker One. Although they still track the price of a bitcoin on these markets, and even though the volume on these markets is pretty small compared to the bitcoin regular (as each ETF has a specific amount backing it) the price isn't nearly as volatile as bitcoin's.
These definitions may help - you can think of owning bitcoin on your wallet as the stock and the ETF as, well, an ETF. But it's basically a bitcoin certificate.
"When you own an individual stock, you own a piece of one company. It's up to you to decide which companies you want to invest in, and you're the one who determines when's the right time to buy, sell or hold."
"Nowadays there are ETFs that invest in a wide variety of market sectors, in addition to those that are linked to an exchange. They're similar to mutual funds, in that their shareholders have a fractional ownership in in a set of stocks [bitcoin, or an ETF that holds a mix of cryptos and you own a share in the ETF and therefore own a specific amount of each]."

Technically every altcoin regardless of merits could be integrated into bitcoin as a sidechain.

Copay is great as far as user experience is concerned. The interface is pretty minimal and supports multiple wallets. It also supports multisig with other copay wallets so if you want to set up joint accounts or add an extra layer of security for yourself you can set it up on another device and add it as a copayer.
It is a full wallet and comes with backup options so you can store them digitally on a flash drive and keep them hidden in case of emergency.
There are a few transaction privacy concerns though as it runs through BitPay's bitcore wallet service and so they may be able to see your transactions if needed. However if you're really concerned there are ways to set up your own bitcore wallet service.
It also supports glidera to buy and sell directly from the wallet, but as you already have coinbase this may not be as useful.

The difficulty target adjustment happens every 2016 blocks, which may or may not take 2 weeks if there is more power added during that time so that blocks come out a little faster. This is why on average the block time is around 10 minutes.

Signaling just means voicing your support for the system.

Some would argue that it's good to signal so you know how much support the idea has before the activation.

I've tested Nicehash and this is what I can tell you:
If you're using Nicehash it will mine altcoins using your GPU/CPU and (may?) rent the computing power to people wishing to buy from Nicehash as a cloud mining operator.  When you link your address you're not mining bitcoins at all, but switching back and forth between altcoins that have the best profitability. Since you would be mining at least 1-5 different altcoins instead of showing your balance in those coins it shows as a total in bitcoins.
After you hit the withdrawal limit, I believe it will send the coins to the linked address, minus any transaction/miner fees to send those bitcoins across the network.

tl;dr - Bitcoin requires consensus to make changes which requires voting and therefore politics. It doesn't matter who's writing the code, someone will need to have a say in what goes into it and it can't be everybody all at once all the time.
The fact is that they do, sort of. The Bitcoin Core team develops the reference implementation for the whole bitcoin protocol. You need to remember that bitcoin is a protocol, and not just the software (Core, Electrum, Armory, Multibit) that runs on top of it.
The software that runs on top of bitcoin protocol can add *features* to its own software, but not change the rules of how bitcoin works. The Bitcoin Core team does not just manage the wallet, but also the protocol itself. You can't have an apolitical dev team in the bitcoin protocol because the rules need to be enforced somehow - the code attempts to do this by rejecting invalid blocks, but when a major change occurs it's extremely important that all parties accept the outcome. This could be addressed by Smart contracts, but then you're just making an AI do all the work. Someone has to enforce the rules - human or otherwise. 
The Bitcoin protocol is the set of rules that says "blocks can only hold 1MB of data". If Coinbase makes its own implementation that's fine, but voting has to occur - either by user-agent comments, BIPS, or Pull requests. Doing it by what software you run is dangerous when any changes you make can affect all users of the system - even when the users that don't want to run your code get forced to.
The bitcoin core team is essentially the W3C in bitcoin. They tell you what the standards of the Bitcoin protocol is (BIPs/RPC-API) and how to interact with the protocol. If you don't want to adhere to the protocol that's OKAY, but you need to have your ideas vetted by the people that manage it AND the users to have it included - or else you risk breaking the system (in the case of Bitcoin, not so much in HTTP).
Another example: If the Bitcoin core team were to evaporate tomorrow, no one would be managing the rules and there would be no one to make political decisions on how the protocol moves forward. At this point a few things are bound to happen:
* People would flock to altcoins with their own set of rules and politics and leaders
* A few smaller dev teams and miners would try to wrest control of the current Bitcoin creating a few different *compliant* wallets that adhere to the current rules but add their own flavour - these would all operate the way our multitude of wallets do now until their new featureset is active (or until voting passes, as you suggest it should). At this point everyone with a slightly different feature *may* or *may not* be compatible with the current network - creating multiple forks of the network and yet a whole new slew of altcoins. 
At this point each one of the competing implementations of the protocol is now "new Bitcoin" and will try to gain control of the whole network again - being a political move. Consensus requires voting which is politics. Since we all run a version of bitcoin that is compatible with the current state of the protocol we have all agreed to a set of laws - passed down as code, enforced by code, decided upon by whoever manages the code.

* You have the capability to verify all the transactions on the blockchain happened for yourself. No need to rely on someone you don't trust to tell you about the transaction that are happening on the network.
* You also add to the network by broadcasting/relaying transactions on the network - though this could be accomplished with very few nodes as well.
2) Transaction fees do vary, and it depends on the size of the transaction itself and how the wallet calculates fees. A recent transaction I tried to send with BitPay wallet was quoting 0.002647-0.00522/kB - My transaction was going to cost me $14 on 0.06 BTC Upgrades like Lightning should relieve some of the pressure on the chain and drop the fees.
3) Most(all) of the time your bitcoin will be bitcoin. But with this recent possibility of a chain split there is the possibility you could have two sets of coins. If you wait for all the dust to settle after Aug 1 there should be a clear winner, and you can use the client that supports it. Before Aug 1 it should be no different to use bitcoin as normal (as I understand it).

What I'm saying is that you get the same data and notice message if you poll  
They're telling you to change your endpoint by August 1st because they're switching over to api.gdax.com URL for good on Aug 24th - which is after the 1st. You have already done that, so you can safely ignore the notice message. 
The reason it's showing up on api.gdax.com is because right now they're still allowing api.exchange.coinbase.com and rather than serve two sets of data - one with the notice and one without - they're using two different URLs for the same server.

I had the same problems with the person not being there, and that was on two separate occasions. So I managed to find one not too far off and once it was set up I can have it done in 10 minutes every subsequent time. 
Of course, bitcoin would be an option, but it would need to be liquidated near instantaneously in most cases and western union does give the option a little easier than bitcoin.
I will agree however that exchange rates and fees of that place are extremely absurd. In my visits they ranged from 5.9 to 8%.

Segwit is a somewhat incompatible change to how blocks are organised in regards to older nodes, so the miners or nodes that support it say "this is what I want to see in Bitcoin" by setting up their node to display a comment (look at [bitnodes user agents]( or running the software or set a specific bit in the blocks they mine.

1. Mycelium does create change addresses for you and keeps them hidden (because you don't really need to specify them). It will keep them in your wallet and will persist over a new import (wiping mycelium and putting the seed in again). When you try to spend again, the change will automatically pull in if needed.
Don't know number 2, not used Coinbase wallet for scanning or know a whole bunch about addresses but it's probably some sort of hash or checksum. The other thing I can think of is that the first 7-8 characters can be spoofed in a vanity address (upper/lowercase differences, numbers), so maybe coinbase is letting you verify the important part of the address.

A candle is only showing completed orders. If your order is not completed it will sit in the orderbook and wait to be completed at which point it will be added to whatever candle it completes in. 
If all orders placed in the next minute influenced the 1 minute candle you wouldn't have a very good representation of the price. If I add a buy order right now for $50,000USD/btc and that influenced the candle you would see that bitcoin had a high of $50,000
A candle chart is just the *actual* price movement - buys and sells. What the orderbook shows is *theoretical* movement and the orders that are currently on the market - if I want the price to go to $2436 USD I have to buy 259BTC on Kraken and go through a bunch of orders, some of which could have been sitting there since Kraken was opened.

Aren't miners computing the block hash based on transactions inside it, how can a block hash be found if there's no transactions?
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:02:12
It takes around 10 minutes in average to confirm because that's the way it was coded. The difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks so that it averages out regardless of how many miners are on the system.
Transactions confirming slower is a combination of a lot of transactions taking place and fees outbidding other transactions. But blocks are still found every 10 minutes.
I don't remember the specifics as to why 10, but I think it may have been arbitrary. Need to read the whitepaper again.

If you import a private key it is still spendable by the wallet you got that key from, but you don't have to pay a transaction fee because its not actually moving the bitcoin. This is generally not a good idea if you're dealing with something like paper wallets that you received from someone else: you don't know if they've made copies of that key. 
Also if you're dealing with a paper wallet or address from another wallet and import the address instead of sweep and try to spend only part of it, a change address is created which you don't have access to. This is why sweeping is preferred.
Sweeping a private key just means to pull the balance into a new wallet/address. This goes onto the block chain and puts the whole balance into a new address. This incurs a transaction fee because you are moving the balance from one address to another.

You have to assume that they do, because they are a MSB. If they know you name and stuff they can identify your addresses and that you sent bitcoins to other places (other people cannot unless you tell them or they know an address that belongs to coinjar which paid you, directly or indirectly). With chain analytics tools patterns can form and coinjar can hypothesize what your bitcoins are being spent on.
This is why coin mixers are touted a good idea - if the MSBs know your spending habits and can inform your government if so asked, they're not much better than the banks.

I've done something like  in GnuCash and set up an account for Desktop (checking-like), Mobile(cash-in-wallet) and Paper Wallet(savings) which allows me to add the proper amount of decimals, though I'm not sure it meets all the requirements of tracking  you mention unless I can "prove" where I spent it. As far as live exchange rate, BTC/XBT needs to be implemented either as a currency/stock in GnuCash/ISO. Proper accounting of debits and credits my way relies on making sure that both the debiting account  and crediting account mirror the -0.1 share and +0.1 if transferring BTC-&gt;BTC (since you're not supposed to be able to transfer value of one stock directly into another). If transferring BTC-&gt;fiat value/expense column, you need to make sure you use the correct sell value or stock price.

Depending on the government it may be taxed as capital gains once you've cashed out.
