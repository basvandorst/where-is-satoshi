What does TA mean?
@_date: 2019-07-29 16:25:49
You can’t exit the system but civil disobedience is a thing.
@_date: 2019-07-29 12:37:21
Me to, it’s fun to learn... SHART!
@_date: 2019-07-07 10:13:18
I use electrum I can’t remember where I downloaded it, is there any way I can verify it I think I still have the install file.
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:45:54
Yes.. yes I would!
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:36:34
Isn't that more like Alpha Centauri, I always thought of the Moon as a monetary value orientated goal.
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:03:28
Sorry to hear man that really sucks I hope you have some reserves.
@_date: 2019-07-04 20:22:29
Thanks that will do the job nicely.
@_date: 2019-07-19 09:42:46
@_date: 2019-07-23 21:10:32
Because they were talking when the phones were confiscated.
@_date: 2019-07-31 16:46:20
My god this is an epidemic.
@_date: 2019-07-27 11:59:03
Yep changing money into more money.
@_date: 2019-07-31 17:03:41
Yeah I guess that’s part of it, I wonder how many women saw the potential and got in near the beginning when it was financially less risky.
@_date: 2019-07-19 19:52:06
@_date: 2019-07-23 20:29:18
How is that gonna hurt the government?
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:16:49
That’s a great album name
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:58:44
I never understand why someone would want jewellery over money in general but especially Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-04 04:05:16
Your right they probably drive shit to.
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:25:12
Exactly they could have wasted their time vs the possibility of it going to zero after spending 10k plus a coin. I got in soon enough thank you and my risk is minimal compared to the newcomers.
@_date: 2019-07-30 21:49:44
Not as bad as yours maybe try elaborating I’m open to hear why I am wrong?
@_date: 2019-07-31 10:23:55
He is advertising (literally to the world now) that he is most likely hodling bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-31 16:21:16
It’s for the best, try to get some  sleep, hopefully this will all of blown over by tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-07-25 14:26:33
No it isn't but I like the $1,000,000 Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-29 12:32:06
Nothing “woke” about this, may I suggest you Google the term or just interchange it with the term “sjw”
@_date: 2019-07-22 17:07:16
You do know this guy is a massive peado? I think most people couldn't care less for his opinion.
@_date: 2019-07-19 18:55:16
I made a trade and I was way higher than these guys.
@_date: 2019-07-20 18:08:27
Yes they do because they are being blocked from using Android and who is going to buy a proprietary huawei os phone. People want Android or Apple.
@_date: 2019-07-19 15:15:38
That’s impossible they don’t have any good songs.
@_date: 2019-07-26 19:04:35
This page will tell you when your btc holdings will be enough to get a Lambo. I don't know how but they tell you the exact day. 
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:24:00
Ah thanks google was not my friend on this matter.
@_date: 2019-07-31 11:05:43
This is the best one I’ve seen.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:21:50
No that could never happen,
@_date: 2019-07-24 14:27:06
@_date: 2019-07-24 23:04:53
Send it to me.
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:04:33
I can't really see Apple and Androids dominance being threatened but if it is that can only be a good thing im not a fan of either company.
@_date: 2019-07-12 20:08:35
Woke people don’t give a fuck about the fed or anything of that importance.
@_date: 2019-07-08 13:00:31
But if it’s opt in surely that would create problems wouldn’t it need to be adopted globally?
@_date: 2019-07-06 18:39:19
What sorcery is this...
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:39:58
I don’t like the back and that is what most people are gonna see.
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:54:07
When Lambo?
@_date: 2019-07-12 22:34:21
Ok I’m not saying that nothing should be done about the fed im saying this meme makes no sense, being woke is about race and gender politics ending the fed has nothing to do with being “woke”
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:39:06
That's nuts, you would think there would be a shortage of coin seeing as there will only ever be 21 million.
@_date: 2019-07-28 18:35:13
Then what do you spend it on if you keep it hidden?
@_date: 2019-07-25 16:08:39
I don't see the point of this, he didn't earn actual Bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-07-13 10:06:58
Go broke
@_date: 2019-07-29 16:22:39
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:20:49
“If it were legal, they'd sell baby organs to make a buck” that sounds pretty evil to me.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:39:42
I keep seeing this figure, why?
@_date: 2019-07-22 22:02:47
Interesting, tell me... why do your people revere Toadfish Rebecchi so much?
@_date: 2019-07-28 20:15:09
I see.
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:45:33
Just do it.
@_date: 2019-07-12 10:08:44
I hope it’s worth the 80 million asking price.
@_date: 2019-07-05 23:21:16
God damn it I had no idea bch was worth that much I’ve missed out big time.
@_date: 2019-07-22 23:51:57
@_date: 2019-07-24 13:27:02
Jesus if you went that deep into any meme I'm sure there would be egregious shortcomings.
@_date: 2019-07-31 11:19:30
I didn’t say it did increase the amount of full Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-30 11:09:56
It’s not the same, a pizza is a physical item that exists it has a finite amount that can be cut up in any meaningful amount, bitcoin can theoretically be cut up to no end and people will not go hungry so to speak. I’m not saying this will happen but it can.
@_date: 2019-07-31 13:58:22
I’ll get your coat.
@_date: 2019-07-19 14:13:27
Civilisation doesn’t need taxes or government.
@_date: 2019-07-31 16:13:52
Saying that though more women should be buying Bitcoin, think of the gains we could have, why the hell are they missing out.
@_date: 2019-07-19 20:50:19
Hairy balls you say?
@_date: 2019-07-08 18:28:26
There has to be a better name than satoshiaire what will they call those lucky enough to own an entire bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-23 20:11:26
What about this is a scam? All I see is his Twitter with the updates, what am I missing. Cheers
@_date: 2019-07-24 15:07:39
How is Bitcoin antithetical to Capitalism?
@_date: 2019-07-28 11:35:36
Another crash would be brutal for future adoption, if it keeps crashing then new people are not gonna risk investing.
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:14:26
$100k is cool but you know what’s really cool... $1,000,000
@_date: 2019-07-30 09:26:17
But they technically can by adding a unit smaller than a satoshi.
@_date: 2019-07-13 00:53:16
Google it, it’s basically another word for a sjw which is more do as I say and think like we do or we will shut you down with OUTRAGE
@_date: 2019-07-31 16:07:51
Oh no the feminazis will hear about this. Bitcoin is sexist!
@_date: 2019-07-31 10:32:05
But heeeeee eee will always love you ooooo yeahhhhhh
@_date: 2019-07-27 23:10:56
People will always need to borrow money and bitcoins volatility makes it less than ideal for the task.
@_date: 2019-07-29 13:59:17
Here I fixed it for you. 
I think the internet is going to be one of the major forces for increasing the role of government.
The one thing that is missing but that will soon be developed is a reliable way to stop manspreading.
@_date: 2019-07-20 17:05:11
I don’t see SV only Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-31 15:26:28
That was my goal to be in the 1 mill club, and for a fleeting moment I made it until it disintegrated before my very eyes :(
@_date: 2019-07-23 11:28:17
I don't know, 10 years in jail is a pretty good deterrent .
@_date: 2019-07-07 10:06:17
Early adopters had less risk, what’s a dollar compared to 10k.
@_date: 2019-07-29 19:16:06
Well then problem solved :)
@_date: 2019-07-23 20:33:36
Don't worry I see the scam now.
@_date: 2019-07-27 12:03:24
I still don’t see the point, BTC price fluctuates but best of luck with it.
@_date: 2019-07-23 20:36:55
Fear not my friend, I have a feeling dick is still on the menu.
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:58:43
Seems to me you have two options.. Find someone who loves you for you or find a way to get more bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-12 20:58:15
The fed has an issue with woke people?
@_date: 2019-07-23 11:23:27
Is porn illegal in Canada or something?
@_date: 2019-07-05 22:51:08
Cars are for roads… where we're going we don't need roads.
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:09:50
So your saying some people could already be on the moon? like some kind of advanced breakaway civilization secretly hoarding their advanced technology for their own selfish goals.... Damn them!
@_date: 2019-07-28 20:55:47
Did you name her before or after Daenerys went batshit.
@_date: 2019-07-27 22:47:45
I don’t get it, if he cashed out at 17k than surely he is winning and loving life being able to buy back at 9.5k
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:07:44
Well ill be damned.
@_date: 2019-07-07 12:15:17
Thats not risk accept the possible risk of wasting your time, what did they have to lose exactly?
@_date: 2019-07-06 12:30:36
They are surely in cahoots.
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:48:28
I’m sure Tesla’s are great to drive but damn they look boring.
@_date: 2019-08-01 08:34:30
Maybe you should get of the drugs before telling other people to.
@_date: 2019-08-17 10:42:01
@_date: 2019-08-01 15:56:19
I don’t think anyone is denying climate change it’s just the cause that is in dispute.
@_date: 2019-08-01 19:58:54
Better hope you don’t go to Hell.
@_date: 2019-08-01 20:35:58
Ah I didn’t see the police on my phone. Thanks
@_date: 2019-08-02 17:14:00
Yes that is the gist of what I’m saying but doesn’t sub dividing create new units? A Satoshi is a unit of Bitcoin currently the smallest so if this is expanded in the future couldn’t we theoretically have new units smaller than a Satoshi?
@_date: 2019-08-01 21:22:44
No it doesn’t all those things can be handled by the free market.
@_date: 2019-08-01 19:09:33
I know but it’s not a positive thing and just because it’s happened before doesn’t mean it will happen every time.
@_date: 2019-08-03 17:41:23
Who the hell is going to fall for that.
@_date: 2019-08-03 18:07:12
Give her a Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-08-05 03:02:06
That’s all well and good but what about six years from now?
@_date: 2019-08-01 19:57:39
But diet is the most important part of the Mcafee plan.
@_date: 2019-08-08 20:13:36
I was just gonna say I watched a video which tallied up the cost of the presidential candidate’s planned programs and Bernie was way up there he will add to the debt like a mofo.
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:52:23
@_date: 2019-08-01 19:03:49
I don’t get it?
@_date: 2019-08-01 16:08:01
Surely corrections of that magnitude will make Bitcoin fail, why would new people risk investing if it keeps crashing, especially if that bad.
@_date: 2019-08-08 20:18:15
Voting for someone that will massively increase the debt would be voting against my own “self interests”.
@_date: 2019-08-01 15:41:23
That’s not Bitcoin, Bitcoin doesn’t sound like that.
@_date: 2019-08-01 21:45:12
No I didn’t op never stated full Bitcoins I was stating that more units of bitcoin can be created by dilution.
@_date: 2019-08-04 11:18:06
Under what circumstances would a logo for a Satoshi really be needed or useful ?
@_date: 2019-08-01 21:18:10
I thought you were joking but Liberland is a thing and it sounds awesome.
