You can import the wallet file into electrum which doesn't require you to download the whole blockchain:

While genesis is a poor investment there's a few platforms (only a handful) that are great.  I've made good money on HashNest which is owned by Bitmain.  My recent investment with them is for Litecoin mining and I've already gotten 45% of my investment back in 5 weeks.  I've been using them for years and the reason I like them is that there is an open marketplace for hashpower so you can always liquidate your assets at any time to other users and get your return early.

How does that work? It sounds like you guys are going to be doing the purchasing, but in Amazon's TOS it says that you cannot make purchases using your own affiliate link.

Hmmm what pool/software do you have that has this multipool capability? also is it tricky to convert all the different currencies into one? can ASICs be used to mine things like terracoin? I thought these altcoins used a different proof of work algorithm

interesting O.O, I wonder if it's more cost effective for small ASIC users to try out some of these?

Where? I haven't been able to find a deal like that anywhere...

their ASICs can't mine altcoins

The first USB miners were 2BTC each. It's interesting that the blade cost is approaching BFL prices though :P
Agreed that shares are the way to go
