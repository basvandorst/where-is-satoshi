Just the end of month CME futures getting ready to come due. So make this 22 drops out of the last 25 months.
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:58:47
No it has already been admitted that CME futures were created to crash BTC to protect consumers 
"The Trump administration has been a beacon of controversy for the past 3 years, and now it seems that controversy has extended to the crypto markets.
In a recent interview with Coindesk, the former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), J. Christopher Giancarlo, claimed that the Trump administration played a part in the 2017-2018 Bitcoin (BTC) bubble bursting.
According to Giancarlo, the Trump administration purposely allowed the introduction of Bitcoin futures products as part of an effort to deflate the runaway crypto bull market.
“One of the untold stories of the past few years is that the CFTC, the Treasury, the SEC and the \[National Economic Council\] director at the time, Gary Cohn, believed that the launch of bitcoin futures would have the impact of popping the bitcoin bubble. And it worked,” Giancarlo told Coindesk.""

Just another day where big money crashes btc when it tests $4k + 
Each week we get 1 day where they drop between 200 to 400 million in btc to push the price down to liquidate long positions and then buy back low..... but hey did anyone see that 50 mill buy that pushed btc from 3940 to 4000 and rekt a bunch of shorts.... ah made my day.

@_date: 2019-08-29 20:37:14
Exactly they will be creating demand whether they are betting for or against it ie the need to buy btc to short it and they need to buy btc too long it.
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:00:09
One can only hope that CME dies in a ball of fire along with exchanges like bitmex who offer things like 1x100 leverage when the btc they are borrowing you is not actually in their account.
The purpose of BTC was to get away from fractional reserves and printing money and here exchanges are going off chain and printing fake btc and doing fractional reserves. 
At least when Bakkt launches and does possession based futures (assuming they hit this volume) they will be exchanging roughly 1.1 million btc per month real btc creating a real demand.
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:00:35
Just the typical end of month pre futures settlement Crash.............. this has happened like clock work for the last 6 or 7 months now. Futures are settled the last Friday of each month. That means the last week of each month is crash BTC week since the price of futures are determined by the spot price of btc ;)
@_date: 2019-08-01 17:18:13
CME issues a news release saying that they were no longer going to issue futures. BTC rose from $4,000 usd to $13,500 USD
CME begins issuing futures setting record numbers for contracts issued, BTC falls too $9,000 and is range bound. 
It has been proven more than a few times now that the cash settled futures market (betting) controls the price of BTC or the asset they are trading.... like gold for example. 
Combine this with 100x leverage opportunities and it creates opportunities too abritage. Now that 100x is fake btc on exchanges ie these exchanges are saying we will borrow you 100x btc so all of this creates downward pressure on BTC  without creating demand.
Ie is you buy 100 BTC to short it you have created demand. If you get 100x BTC from a leverage you are simply handed a slip saying you ow us 100 BTC if this goes bad.
So why has it gone up.......... well because the futures settle their contracts at the end of the month and well we are in a new month.
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:30:19
Bitmex, Kraken and I cant remember the other one are where cme btc futures takes their price. All of them offer perpetual contracts.
CME cash settled futures is the only place that has a monthly settlement. So every month there futures settles  btc crashes.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:58:26
Just type how btc futures crashed the price of btc. The united states federal reserve did a nice piece on it. 
When you combine a large cash settle future position with the ability to margin trade at 100X it makes it easy to crash btc with say $10 million to ensure that when your futures settle you make good money. 
That is because when you trade on exchange they can do fractional reserves ie they have 100 btc so they let people margin trade up to 1,000,000 btc using IOU's basically exchanges are trading more btc that actually exists at this point. If they wernt this would just create demand and drive the price up.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:38:22
This is the biggest noob post I have seen in ages. Wales have nothing to do with the crash. 
BTC cash settled (bets/non possession based contracts) settle at the end of the month. For the third month in the row they have crashed right before settlement which has driven the price of BTC down.
This is because they are settling those contracts based on the price set by three exchanges and when they have billions of dollars in contracts it makes sense to buy btc and dump it to ensure those contracts make them Money. 
Come the Weekend when the contracts are settled and the markets are closed the price should climb. What we are actually seeing here is the blatant every day manipulation that happens in the regular futures markets.
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:06:50
The former CTFC Chairman admitted that he worked with Trump the Treasure and the Economics council to regulate BTC futures in order to crash the skyrocketing value of BTC for our own good.
Just give it a few years and we will see the Trump and his team also were a few of the first folks to use those futures to long hard.
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:11:03
Thats the problem on the one side you have CME futures ie one party then on the other side you have a bunch of investors. It is far easier for 1 entity to work in its favour than it is for a bunch of people too. Which is why the price of BTC is following the spot price of futures. 
Though granted there are a few things as I mentioned that I see could happen that will break the hold of the futures market on crypto.
@_date: 2019-02-28 15:37:27

This guy needs a hug..... Now some life advice for you, the world's population are a bunch of sheeple heck 90%  or btc subscribers are sheeple as well. Now these sheeple they move like an avalanche all in one direction at a time you drop some news, light a few fires get them riled up and boom off they go. Now some of those sheeple are smarter than the rest and take a little longer to move looking for more solid signs but in the end they also go.
That is why one day the crypto world is coming to an end and its all doom, gloom and here is the if you having bad thoughts hotline.
Then next day there are conspiracy posts.
Essentially the herd runs from one place to the next, exhausts itself looks around for what was supposed to be there finds nothing then runs on so from doom and gloom will come moon posts and from conspiracy post mass adoption. 
So stop being a sheeple seeing a conspiracy and watch the flock
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:27:12
Looks like the comprehension is a little lacking.
1. Someone buys $200 million in CME futures through their broker (cash settled) at $15,000 a coin and shorts them.
2. 2. Settlement date approaches. BTC is $17,000 a coin they have lost $2000
3. So they go onto the market bitmex with $10 million and leverage it 100x then dump it. 
4. Dump (1 billion dollars) worth of BTC and if possible cover shorts.
5. BTC dumps down to $10,000 much wow they just made 33% on $200 mill at a cost of maybe 10 mill
This is what is happening, this is why btc dumps when futures close and this is only possible because exchanges are doing 100x margin trading off chain. If everything goes to dex exchanges or btc gets bigger this will happen less. 
30 hours from now futures are settled and btc can go back to climbing.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:51:42
That would be your lack of imagination. But in the perfect world you are correct if someone bought a bunch of btc to dump it they would create demand driving the price up. 
But wait!!! what do we have here bitmex BTC futures??
What is happening is that these individuals are taking out say cme BTC futures that are cash settled meaning they never create a demand in BTC they simply place a bet.
Then when the time comes they go on an exchange like Bitmex with $10,000,000 million dollars. They take out a  100x leverage position giving them $1 billion in btc and they dump it.
So they may have $200 million in cme futures and for the low low price of $10 million crash they price. If their position gets called big deal they still make money, if their position doenst get called they make money both places. 
The reason this works is because bitmex and other exchanges trading futures do not I repeat do not have that kind of BTC on hand. Since they are trading on their exchange they are using imaginary BTC so it doesn't create a demand when they do this it just creates downward pressure. Now if they were all trading on chain this would be different. 
This is why from time to time we will hear that a big position got called and the losses were shared among all of the shorters or longs because they may lend out 1000 btc but only actually have 200 btc and are doing fractional reserves.

I fear that BTC is going to die and crash just like it did last time. Not because there isnt a demand for it or growth in the area but because groups like the cmj get to run futures on btc
They are pumping 50million+ per day into betting on paper BTC and then manipulating the actual BTC market to guarantee they make money on the future.
Now if they were doing possession settled futures BTC would be hitting like $100k right now but they arnt the sec is blocking ETF's and possession based futures markets at every turn if things dont change btc will just dry up and fall again.
The only reason BTC ran is because the CMJ said they were halting futures for a while and then it shot up to $8k before they resumed and surprise surprise the bull run was halted. They are doing the exact same thing to BTC as they did to gold years ago. Print fake gold/btc asign value to it and then use it to crash the actual asset. Now if BTC gets big enough one day it can shrug off this manipulation but we would need constant usage and like a trillion dollar market cap for that.
So forget your supports and you charts and lines. 
BTC is going down unless say Bakkt get approval, or a couple billionaires show up and buy 25% of it or groups like Bitmex stop lending BTC for shorting/longing that doesn't actually freaking exist.
@_date: 2019-12-16 21:04:14
Sigh the trump administration allowed CME to short bitcoin to crush the price and that is exactly what happened. The federal reserve even published a report on how shorting knocked bitcoin down when it hit $20,000
Now guess what fast forward a few years and every exchange and their dog has leveraged shorting available, and there are multiple regulated shorting options. In short I doubt we will see BTC climb back to $20,000 unless there is a massive recession. 
Shorting is when every-time you see any growth it gets hammered down hard ;)

And yet unlike most shit coins that you probably champion BAT has actually accomplished things Ie  
1. They made a new web browser called Brave that actually works (freaking well)  
2. They have a business model that seems to work, solving a need.  
3. They have publishers both small and large onboarding and using their product.  
4. If you enter beta you can earn bat tokens for allowing adds and info gathering.  
At the end of the day bat needed a token to represent redeemable value, so they made a token to do exactly that.

The real Satoshi Nakamoto remained anonymous at every point during the creation of the coin, then he/she/it remained anonymous while it grew and then exploded. However the real Nakamoto did leave a trump card to their identity the original wallets which if they have the key they can access and prove who they are.
This guy isnt using that trump card, he is simply claiming and identity without providing any actual proof saying that we simply have to trust that he is who he claims to be while he could easily access that account send a fraction of a coin and say he is who he is.
So rather than use logic and a process that Nakamoto left in place Craig is asking us to take it on faith that he is Nakamoto 
At the end of the day he is just a guy filling a void knowing that they only one who can challenge his claim is an entity that has chosen to remain anonymous.

You had a large number of wealth people with little knowledge hop into crypto mining and mind with an ROI that required $15,000+ bitcoin so they have been over mining coin and dumping it at a loss to stay afloat.

Futures are bad for bitcoin like they are bad for gold. When they are settled in cash like this one will be and like CME and CBOE they are simply paper bets on the price of BTC they encourage market suppression without stimulation. If these futures were actually possession based like BAKKT will be that creates a demand Ie you want a futures contract for 10,000 BTC well we will have to go and purchase 10,000 BTC from the market
Right now if you want a futures contract for 10,000 BTC from CME well of course sir the BTC price is $4,000 so let me give you a piece of paper here saying that you own 10,000 BTC at $4,000 
If the futures market was physical settlement or physical possession with a cash settlement right now instead of cash (paper based) BTC would be north of $20,000

So yes paper BTC offered on margin is what is bending over the crypto market right now. If this was all being done on a dex however ie no paper BTC and only physical BTC then crypto would be mooning so hard right now because every leveraged position would create actual demand.

Other than the obvious trolling here you are actually correct in some instances ie exchanges permitting individuals to leverage. Not in all cases but in many they allow people to dump BTC onto their exchange that they dont actually own and that dont actually exists. They can do this because exchanges are really just ledgers without coins physically changing hands.
This enables shorting on a massive scale putting downward pressure on a market while not creating any buying pressure because the coins that are being shorted are for the moment fictional. which is a large part of why bitcoin and the crypto market has tanked it is being shorted into oblivion with non existent coins.... Kind of like etfs but on crypto exchanges. 
So yes troll you are correct in a way.
