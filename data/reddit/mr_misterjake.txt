The value of the US dollar is largely based on the fact that oil is traded in US dollars, when countries don't trade oil in USD we tend to make conflict zones out of those areas and occupy them militarily.  The emergence of the petro-yuan may make things interesting in this area, we only really have dealt with small countries trying this. The people of the United States believe in their troops above all, the military enforces the Petro dollar, therefore the people believe in USD.

I didn't say I liked the way things are, it's just the way things are.

The validity of a currency is that people believe in it and trade with it.  USD is backed by the largest military on the planet.  BTC is backed by a handful of crypto nerds.

You seem way to paranoid for your own good. Scared about backdoors built into wallets thousand of people use every day. But then for some reason you weren't paranoid about giving all of your btc to this one guy you've never met.

You have the ability to "create your own bitcoin  implementation," whatever that means. But didn't feel safe enough to secure your coins in an encrypted wallet or offline paper wallet?

Not if you have Bitcoin. The people that have to worry will be holding $1,000,000 dollar bills in their wallets.
