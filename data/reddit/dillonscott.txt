edit: I've already moved everything to Trezor and put it inside my parents firesafe. It's going to be there for years. I'll add to it as I'm able, after the fork of course.    
edit 2: Actually if it dropped down to $1k next month, fuck I'd be maxing credit cards and selling furniture to buy more.

What wallet are you using?

Make sure your wallet supports splitting your coin for the b2x for otherwise it may be better off staying on an exchange. For example, on coinbase when the fork happens they will duplicate your current wallet into the same amount on b2x as well.  
    
I don't know a lot myself, I use a trezor wallet but there hasn't been an official statement by trezor if they'll do the same. Make sure you take advantage of the duplicate coins.

Can you suggest an alternative then? I need to know for myself. As I posted in the comment I'm also new to all of this. Trezor has released no news about whether the BTC will be split or not. 
    
Can you elaborate why? I've read countless times on this sub that keeping it on coinbase for the split then transferring immediately after the transaction freeze is lifted is not a bad idea.

I talk to pretty much every one of my close friends about it. They're all semi tech savvy and have obviously known about it for a long time. When I send them pictures of like the Trezor wallet I got in the mail or my limits on Gdax for example they just get overwhelmed and usually say something like that's just so daunting or techy.   
     
I just immediately follow up with a bitcoin guide getting started for beginners and answer tons of questions. It's crazy man I'm like an evangelist. I want to print and hand out pamphlets. Lmao

Are you saying that because you think I would've dumped them or because of value or?
