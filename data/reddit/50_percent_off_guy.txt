Hey srry this is not my main account and hadn't checked again. ;)
I made absolutely 0 sales in bitcoin, even with the 50% off. But i got a lot of reactions like this:
* Bitcoin?! Bitcoin is dead!, its completely over! (the guy on the other side of the road and someone passing by)
* BITCOIN ACCEPTED!!! TTTTTSSSSSSSSSSsssss! (2 times guys passing by)
* Bitcoin... (1 girl and 1 guy passing by)
* Bitcoin? lol. But do you sell that magnet board you've that thing on? (1 mother with a child)
* Hey bitcoin. Have you sold something for it? I dont have bitcoins but will buy some maybe later. (1 guy after I sold him my bbq set, sold him 0,05 bitcoins too :D )
My gf laughing that I've sold nothing for bitcoin with even 50% off. maybe because I think it was because wasn't in Amsterdam.

1. Be in the Netherlands or Belgium (This will probably work in other EU countries too.)
2. Use 1 of the many Bitcoin buy/sell companies using Ideal or something similar. Best is to compare them to see who is the cheapest.
3. Type in the amount in € or ฿ and your bitcoin address (public key)
4. Select your bank, confirm order, press OK.
5. In an average of 2 seconds your Bitcoins will pop up at your selected address.

People will look elsewhere, like in 2008/9 and 2013. Better buy gold/silver? Bitcoin is way better in every way, so I put (the majority) of my bet on that. My grandpa lost more by hodling at his bankaccount than if he had invested it at 1200$ in bitcoin. Nothing has changed since then in the financial system and the bubble only got bigger. I'm not a trader but a saver. I wont put my bet on that anymore.

Update : I'm standing in the leegwaterpark. Already sold for 8,60€ in bitcoins and a lot of comments by mainly skeptical people :)

Well.. Zero internet connection for transacting bitcoins is in fact impossible. It needs to be picked up by the miners, added in the blockchain and updated (in the ledger) globally. Someone was creating a way to transact bitcoins using phone or radiowaves or something, but they needed to be the middleman with the internet connection.
But I agree that the P2P mesh network is really a bitcoin related thing at this point in time.

Always funny to read that now a USA based company enters the EU market, suddenly everything will be better for the EU countries. Every EU country already have better Bitcoin services than coinbase, bitpay and circle from the USA. Some extra competition is always better :), but its not like they opened a whole new world.
Btw, the buy pressure is not caused by better bitcoin services, but by failing fiat services. When people are about to loose their money, they'll seek for a way to store their value.

The more you spend bitcoins, the more will be exchanged to fiat. That'll lower the price even more.

That's a great idea too. I have a piper wallet printer, but I need an outlet for that and I don't want to leave it in the open air when its moist outside. Also I don't think people would (or should) trust pre-printed wallets, because I could have a copy of the private key at home. They can trust me with that, but they shouldn't.

Are you realizing that people like you, the scared sellers, are the one who causing the pricedrop? If you dont need the money right away (dont put more money into it than you can affort to lose), you should keep hodling. That is what I say to myself. There is a lot financial instability in the fiat world and I don't want to be late again like in april 2013 (200€). I kept hodling while others sold out with losses.

I'll sell the flowerpots at least. The flowers it self are not certain yet. We'll sell a lot of different stuff. Also computer and xbox 360 games, jackboots, a dvd player, different beerstuff (belt,glass,helmet,ect), books and (my gf mainly) clothes and shoes.
