if you look at the individual orders go through live, you'll see what im talking about. those big buys and sells never seem to affect their thin orderbook. Clear giveaway. but yea hidden in the wash volume there's definitely real trades going on but its just gets "washed" over with all those other trades
@_date: 2017-01-04 07:14:31
OKCoin and Huobi were noobs compared to BTCChina at the time. Just because Okc wicked higher doesn't mean they were the market leader. BTCChina had fees back then and their volume was the highest.
@_date: 2015-08-04 15:32:20
Exactly. When we do have those billion dollar transactions the value of the blockchain and in turn bitcoin itself would be way more. The price as well as the mining hashrate will have to keep up.

Speculation is the reason why bitcoin was even mentioned on the news in March and April.  Discouraging it will slow down the whole "getting the word out" phase as there are still so many people that have no clue what bitcoin is and don't have any motivation to find out. People need some sort of incentive to learn and adapt a new concept. Money is a crucial motivator to spreading the knowledge of bitcoin to the non tech-savvy population. I think speculation is just the initial phase and a fast course to learning about bitcoins.
Take a look at the number of subscribers to this subreddit. I'm pretty sure a lot of them didn't come here to learn about new businesses accepting bitcoins and such: ATLEAST INITIALLY. But later on as learned more and more about what bitcoin actually offers they became less interested in speculating and more interested in the longterm mindset.
And well, there's another subreddit where all "the speculating and cashing out" is talked about and market strategies are discussed.
Here's a link if you're interested:

Good point. My numbers may be off but the overall point I'm trying to make is still the same. Go outside and try asking a random person (age 30 or younger) what bitcoin is. See what kind of replies you get.

I'd like to suggest something BTW. It would be more useful if you also post a link to bitcointip documentation (Quick start guide) along with the tip. I know the verification bot already provides a "Help" button but it's going to be buried deep in the comments and will be harder to access than having the "[help]( link in your comment. 
Definitely can't wait to see it in action!

That is all Bitcoin needs. A chance. The market and the people involved will take care of the rest. Once a significant amount of people become involved in bitcoin it will be very hard to stop its growth. I just hope China can "tolerate bitcoin" until a point where it's too late for them to do something about it. 
Tl;dr   This will allow bitcoin to reach that ultimate "point of no return", where they wouldn't be able to stop it even if they wanted to.

Can you please link me to their customer service email? It is no where to be found on their website. I have no way to get in touch with them.
Edit: Btw I have seen their thread on the forums as well that's why I was hesitant to call them a scam but after losing my bitcoins to them without being able to contact them for the last 11 days feels like a scam to me.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:33:04
Can you give an update on what your thoughts are about where you think the prices might end up? I would like to know because you got most of your weekly predictions right.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:08:48
I sent a deposit to my Mtgox wallet at around 9:00 Pm EST. It arrived in my account at 4:41 Am. So it took 7 hours and 41 minutes for it to show up. U'll be fine, it might just take way longer than you expected
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:11:55
Honestly, I think bitcent should be the next appropriate step. Jumping straight on to mBTC at the current price is too early. If you want Bitcoin to be considered mainstream then you have to understand that a person with an average IQ will dislike the idea of dealing with decimals on a daily basis. mBTC will definitely catch on when the price gets above $1000/BTC
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:36:12
Sadly, that might be their only incentive to leave Bitcoin alone
@_date: 2013-08-06 02:34:10
Don't see anything wrong with that idea. I understand there's potential for abuse but the benefits of this are far greater.
@_date: 2013-05-09 03:00:09
That's true but its been a while since this happened last time. People tend to forget their "learned-lessons" as time passes unless those "lessons" are reinforced again and again. I still think we're gonna see that primitive style panic sell-off just due to the sheer number of new-b's in the game out-numbering the "wisened" pros.

I have used Bitfloor for decently sized deposits. I can confirm that buying bitcoins with US dollars was extremely fast. The whole process took me 15 minutes. Although they did have a few problems recently because of the crash and all. 
But this is the fastest way to convert cash into bitcoins. Gotta love US based companies..

Are you talking about the wall that formed at $70 a few weeks ago? I thought that was a "fake" wall as well but ended up causing the rally towards 90s and it hasn't gone back that low ever since.

Same exact thing happened to me. They have not responded back to me yet. I have been waiting for almost half a day now. Never again using Bitfloor.
@_date: 2013-08-22 03:21:27
If this video is truly affiliated with ebaydeals^[I ^(don't even know if this is even a real thing)^], then I'm speculating that this is some kind of survey video where they try to find out "what people think" about bitcoins before they make any moves. By they I mean Paypal. Hence the ending, "What do you think? Are Bitcoins a good deal?". Purely guessing here but it's fun to talk about nevertheless. 
@_date: 2013-06-01 03:59:20
I'm thinking the same here. The 7.9K btc floor is more credible just because of the fact that it was placed so close to the market price at that time. If the person responsible didn't intend to buy then why would he place the order so close to the market price and risk being bought out. 
Anyways, this post might get down-voted to oblivion because this subreddit hates talking about the market and trading side of bitcoins. There's another subreddit where those things are talked about more openly. Here it is if you haven't seen it yet.

How can you be so sure that US-based alternatives are a safer option than an over-seas exchange like Mt.Gox? If anything, a US-based exchange would be way more prone to seizure than an over-seas based exchange. Take Bitfloor for example. Hardly any information was given to why they were shutdown. I agree that Mt.Gox's future is completely down the drain because of their incompetent CEO but until there are exchanges that are approved (by the government) to do business in the US, I would keep my money in exchanges that are over seas and out of US jurisdiction.

The Bitcoin network will hardly be affected by any government control over the Internet because of its P2P nature. Although, the same can't be said for the exchanges. They are the most vulnerable to intervention by the government.
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:47:41
You see, it's more complicated than that. Most of the pros on this subreddit know it's fake and they are just hoping that other people "noobs" react to this message and panic sell and cause a crash without any ddos so they can buy in low.

Thanks but, really not sure about transferring money into another US-based company. I'm still awaiting to get my Bitfloor funds back. I think I will let it stay in Mtgox instead of panicking. There are millions of dollars in total in Mt.Gox accounts so there has to be a better way in the future.

I don't know why people don't realize that it's not just "one" trader or one "group" that makes those orders. Atleast not all the time you see a huge sell-off. The number of bitcoins are bunched together for a particular **price** and it wouldn't matter if one person or 100 people sell. Learn how to read those charts people! Godddd.

Absolutely makes sense for them to use Bitcoin as a payment method since they are already cash businesses and require such high security measures just to keep the cash stored safely.

@_date: 2013-04-17 04:27:28
I do agree with the possibility of this buy wall being a large seller. That was the first thing that crossed my mind. But what interests me is **when** the buy wall/order was set in place. I was watching the clarkmoody chart around the time this occurred. And I saw that this order was placed when the price was around 71-71.5 which could have easily swung backwards within a matter of seconds and might have started chewing on buy wall. So I'm still curious to why this/these investor placed their buy orders so close to that price if they didn't intend to actually buy. Why not place is at, say, 68 or 65 which was much below the 71-71.5 range.
I don't know if I made my point clear to read but I hope you get the idea.
@_date: 2013-05-30 02:24:37
