volume is also next to meaningless since transactions on exchanges dont actually move anywhere... if you want meaningful numbers look at one of the block explorers...

I am just sad that coinbase doesn't do more... I am sad no one steps up to compete...
I am sad that because I live in canada not only do i have to deal with 4% fees I don't have the ability to transact on GDAX... Yes I know there are alternatives for canadians but none as simple as coinbase and many that price gouge even worse.

I could argue the pros of credit cards and consumer protection that the banks offer via charge backs that is missing in the crypto space making it hard for consumers to go after fraudulent businesses... But honestly I think in your mind you have it wrong you are comparing BTC to credit when you should be comparing it to cash, cash has no service/transaction fees you pay for something it is yours you go back to return it you don't have the ability to issue a charge back because you paid in cold hard cash...
The real issue people have with the fees though is that they aren't comparing bitcoin to transacting with visa, debit, or even cash - they are comparing it to transacting with dash or ethereum or litecoin, or dozens of others where you get 1/10th to 1/1000th of the fee and a significantly faster network...
