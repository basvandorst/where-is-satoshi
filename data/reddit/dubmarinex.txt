Bitcoin fees are too high. I agree it’s having a limiting affect on use as a currency. It still compares quite favourably to other stores of value, think of the transport cost of gold etc. 
I don’t want to get into the politics of Bitcoin but let’s just say I think the current situation is...unnecessary.

Satoshi assumed what everyone should assume and that's that people will always try and game the system if there is an advantage to be had. His genius was creating a rule set that meant that people should act in their own self interest and that would be best for the system. 
In this case lower mining rewards and higher fees/greater number of transactions should at least in the long run disencentivize these types of counterproductive actions. 
Eventually there will no no mining reward and the network, if it is to survive, needs revenue. That sole revenue will be transaction fees.

A number a reasons.
1. When a miner successfully mines a block (and gains the mining reward) he/she/it can mine the next block immediately without having to download the block (it just mined) to verify it, giving it an advantage over the others. Because the transactions of the previous block have not yet been verified by the network it will not include any transaction in the next block it is attempting to mine so as to avoid any duplicate transactions, this would result in this new block being rejected by the network.
2. To spam the network. A malicious miner may mine empty blocks to clog up the network. Kind of like a DDOS attack. 
3. Other reasons I haven't thought of.

So they don't mine empty blocks

Can anyone link to some 'explain it to me like I'm five' instructions for splitting my BTC/BCH from a paper wallet?
I would be forever in your debt. (figuratively not literally ;)

If most people are selling their BCH but the price of BTC is not going down where is the money coming from?

I was looking for BTC to drop a bit after the fork so I could add to my stack...guess I should be happy

Right now r/BTC is obsessed with r/bitcoin and r/bitcoin is obsessed with r/BTC
I think you two should just get a room.

If you were a miner you would mine whatever is most profitable. Mining is expensive and they need to pay bills and make profit or what's the point.

Some miners have setups that automatically switch over to mining Bitcoin Cash when it's more profitable to do so. The majority stay put but I'm couldn't say whether their reason for doing so is pragmatic or dogmatic.

The miners will always and should always follow the money.
