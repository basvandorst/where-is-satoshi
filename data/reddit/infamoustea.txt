Lmao I get a kick out of these scenarios people come up with. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:01:28
Lmao "too big". Too big for what?

Every bubble example I have read has been specific to a certain country. I think its hard to gauge a "bubble" on something as large as bitcoin. Just my opinion.

Good TA.

If they knew what ponzi schemes are and they knew what bitcoin is, they would be dumb to use the two in the same sentence.

Man this is going to be a roundabout discussion. Do you think I invested because of what people said on reddit? Really... lol. And unfortunately that logic doesn't work when there is no third party involved. No single entity is taking my money, and using it for the purposes of paying someone else off so that their books stay clean. That right there is where bitcoin separates itself from being a Ponzi. Sure people can hype it up all they want and they might be able to swing the minds of uneducated investors, but lets not go around assuming what people say on Reddit has that large of an effect on Bitcoin.

I remember in 2011-2012 I used to follow a twitter account that gave updates on bitcoins price every 30 minutes. Price back then was cents on the dollar. I hate "if" statements but if I wasn't 13 years old back then Im sure I would've put some money into the space! Im actually kind of proud of myself for even knowing what it was at a young age! Lol 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:56:18
IMO its more likely they will try and create their own currencies as opposed to owning bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:33:06
It cant be a Ponzi scheme, theres no single entity taking money and paying out others. Its peer to peer, not an investment company.

You know he had to have his hands in it somehow!

From what Ive read Hal was one of the first people to communicate with Satoshi after the white paper was published. Also receiving the first transaction from Satoshi, which is why I don't think Hal was the one to write the white paper.

If you didn't just convince yourself not to switch based on the use of "btrash" and "roger turd" then I doubt anyone will.

Do your brother a favor and hold it for 6 months. You'll thank him and I. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:22:56
Lol I was waiting for the day someone posted this, its been in Crabtree for a surprisingly long time. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:35:29
Look at his other posts. Enough said. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:12:27
Same, I got my dad to buy into Litecoin and Wells Fargo blocked his initial transaction.

I have been expecting a correction back to the 10-12k range. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:50:12
Can Ponzi Scheme and Bitcoin even be used correctly in the same sentence? Lol 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:01:49
I'm aware everything is not about me, but when you reply to my post it becomes about me. MLM isn't a Ponzi scheme haha take Amway for example, it is 100% multi level marketing and it is one of the only US-based companies that is completely debt-free. At this point though I'm just going to agree to disagree because this is wasting my time. Good luck to you. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:42:26
Sure, but Ponzi's also run off the basis of false promises. Nobody promised me anything when I bought in, nobody is using the money I invest to pay someone else. This isn't a Ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:15:50
I wont sell what I have at all, I didn’t go balls to the wall and put all my money into BTC, only what I knew I was willing to lose. So honestly I wont sell until I truly need to or until BTC hits new highs.

Hodl was a drunken spelling error by someone a few years ago [heres the original post ](

This is great.

How much do you average with crypto gambling? Ive always been interested but never took the plunge into it. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 17:56:16
I love answers like this. It truly could do any of the above at anytime. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:38:38

Just curious what about the Chinese New Year will cause a dip? Regulations makes sense. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:11:49
It probably hasn’t been confirmed yet. Just wait a bit longer.
