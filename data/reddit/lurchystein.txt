So right now is a good time to invest in more? I'm still getting used to this market. I know I have seen it well up over 1100 before so there should be decent returns on these. How long do you typically hold onto your coins for?

You really think it's going to surge higher than it already has? 
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:28:45
I'll take that as a know lol. I know traders have systems like that for stocks wasn't sure if it was being used over here

How long will it take after the fork to be ok again?

That makes me feel a little better. I'm guessing 3rd party wallets aren't so forgiving then. Maybe I will just move everything into coinbase for now and hope for an awesome rebound here. Made about half a grand last time it fell.

Copy. Sorry for the questions I'm still figuring this out. I'm trying to decide if I should sell off what I have and wait for it to drop more or hold onto what's in my wallet and hope it goes up. It seems really neutral right now.

Would this be achieved by wallets and exchanges adding a BU option? So say you have a wallet with Xyz bitcoins, will that same wallet also show your BTU without you having to do anything. I guess I'm confused by how we obtain the bu currency and sell it to buy bitcoin.

Would using a wallet like mycellium suffice to do the same thing here?

I was under the assumption that this market had no federal backing. Good to know.

So what exactly is going on? I just bought a few, should I not have?

Sorted it out myself, main support didn't even respond to me. Very upsetting, I have removed my stock in Coinbase and gone elsewhere. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:11:27
So say coinbase disappeared off the face of the earth, I get my money back? How does that work?

Use my address and it will be safe. Pm for info.

I got you, I've been at rock bottom. Hope your situation gets better and what I have helps.
