does omniwallet not let you send or is it not showing up at bittrex? with low fees, your transfer takes way longer. did you check minimum deposit on bittrex?

you have your public key (the adress where your btc is) and usually the private key (with which you sign your transactions out of the public adress)... if you have written down a password, maybe that was a password to a specific wallet? like exodus or mycelium? or you could try run it throu a hash256.. maybe thats your private key then? i dont know, sry.. just try to help a little...
google found this link which might be very helpful

i wonder about your feeling that you will lose on some level.. hey, you found something with value.. be happy about it!
maybe you hold a small part of it, or you see it as a backup for the future?! whatever you do, you already won!

if you decide to change 1 or all, is up to you..  coinbase is the most popular exchange, but depending on where you live ther might be different options. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:43:07
why not BTC-USD and exchange to EUR? 
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:31:00

whats wrong with this? there are soo many stolen Coins out there and they just want to make sure, i guess. Btw, they are based in Switzerland. And, I always had great experience using their service.. just my 2 cent (you still can use shapeshift (Israel) or Binance (Malta)
