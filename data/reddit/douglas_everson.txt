I don't want to give you advice that you could one day regret. But I'm willing to say that I personally sold all Bitcoin cash I had access to. There are merits to both -- similar to merits of ETH, Litecoin, ETC, Iota, Ripple... It's up to you to make that choice for yourself. I have some of a handful of alt coins myself.

Do you understand how Bitcoin Cash was 'created'? There was a hard fork (with some arguably major improvements) that created the 'new Bitcoin' (known as Bitcoin Cash). The people who didn't agree with the changes (siding with SegWit2x upgrades to Bitcoin) continue to mine Bitcoin.

When did you invest: Dec 2012
How much did you initially invest in: $100
How much have you made: More than I expected
Are you glad you invested in bitcoin: Yes, in additional the the money I've made, it's also been very exciting to be a part of a new technology.
Do you think bitcoins and other crypto-currencies will have an impact on the global economy: Yes, most definitely. Given the possibility of such low fees, crytocurrencies have the opportunity to be extremely disruptive in the payments industry.
Good luck! Hope this helps.

The only major reason I can think to use Coinbase (or Bitpay, etc.) is to have the BTC converted to fiat to control for market fluctuations. Most likely not worth the 1% fee in this case.

Huh? NYU is a top 6 program.

That quarter can add up if you are replenishing $10-20 transactions. You can get around it by bundling replenishment, etc. but it still adds some complexity.

Buying Bitcoin from Coinbase, for example, requires a ~1% transaction fee. This could be lowered, but there is still a cost associated with processing ACH which has to be paid for by someone on top of the company's operational costs. Doesn't mean there wouldn't be a market for it though, and I haven't heard of anyone doing it.

It appears they are claiming to be at 
I haven't heard of any success stories though, so I would be hesitant to proceed, personally.

Bitcoin wasn't banned in China and the Chinese exchange BTC China still exists. It was made more difficult to transfer BTC into Yuan (and vice-versa) due to some banks no longer allowing transfers to BTC exchanges and some major companies that stopped allowing you to pay in BTC, but that was far from all banks/companies.

I'm guessing you're not going to get a lot of first-hand accounts here, but it definitely happens. Those that buy during peaks (especially for the first time) and lose a substantial percentage of their money in a few days/weeks tend to lose any optimism they may have had. I've also known others to become pleasantly surprised by their money being multipled very quickly and sell all their BTC to not buy back in.

I wouldn't call any of these methods "likely" to happen, but they are all possible, and it only has to happen once to you for you to lose all your BTC.

You're missing a zero. There are 13M Bitcoins. 1% of 13M = 130K = $65M

Bit of a reply to [Forbe's article]( which reports only $45M (taking number of Bitcoins transacted times current value).
@_date: 2015-05-30 03:38:10
Actually, $46B -- I knew that data didn't look right ($45M OR $320M), but didn't expect it was two orders of magnitude off. There must have been a temporary glitch in the BlockChain data set (I pulled it front he same place both times.)
