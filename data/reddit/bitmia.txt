Sick as tits! \o/
I wonder where do they get the GBP rate from :)

I hope they insure all the deposits, otherwise it's a disaster waiting to happen.

Wow, the audio quality is superb. This looks promising!

Go full or go home, huh?

Bad NRG for deposit addresses + good timing by gentlemen hacker.
@_date: 2015-04-13 19:49:18
So the lack of buyers makes it a different kind of service?
@_date: 2015-04-26 22:40:22
You're basically describing [Bitmia](

@_date: 2015-04-13 21:14:11
Bitmarkets escrow system was inspired by [Nashx]( - they basically just removed the third party from it.
You can read more about this in their [white paper]( - it really makes sense.

Loads much quicker than any Tor marketplace and with no downtimes, so I'm pretty sure it's not this.
@_date: 2015-04-13 20:25:40
I believe they did post everywhere they could, but there wasn't much interest.
@_date: 2015-04-13 21:49:19
Looks like it's [in the works](
@_date: 2015-04-13 18:48:11
Yeah, but not a single active listing? That's obscene...
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:18:24
I wouldn't call it an arbitrage opportunity, but yes, you're better off if you buy tickets in a bull market after many rollovers :)
@_date: 2015-02-26 17:20:52
It's [there]( but you're right, it needs to be highlighted.
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:05:29
Have you browsed through the search results yourself? I don't think I'm getting your point to be honest.
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:22:37
We've just launched [Bitmia.com]( and it incorporates all the things you've mentioned and even improves a few of them - instead of an open source random number generator we're using the blockchain as a source for random as well as for time-stamping purposes. What do you think? :)
@_date: 2015-02-26 18:58:12
You're absolutely correct but please bear in mind that a jackpot has been won just yesterday making the odds/payout ratio look less appealing :) On the positive side, we don't cap the jackpot so we won't be surprised seeing positive EV drawings in the future. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:29:27
Not really (unless, of course, you are talking about selling 816/2 tickets in a single drawing). I believe the ticket odds are independent since tickets "expire" every 144 blocks and we're not selling more than 10 daily at the moment.
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:36:50
It is not a company - just the two of us (with OTC accounts in good standing) organizing a raffle for the fun of it. Would you expect us to publish our home addresses?
@_date: 2015-02-20 16:52:37
Hey everybody,
There is a ton of gambling sites in the Bitcoin world but not a single provably fair lottery backed by established members of this community. Having said that, [yours truly]( and [genericpersona]( are proud to announce the launch of [Bitmia](
We've made the number generation provably fair and we timestamp all purchases cryptographically. It is about as fair and transparent as a lottery can ever get.
We only have a single daily drawing so far (every 144 blocks) and it involves guessing the 3 rightmost hex digits in an upcoming block's hash in any order which gives you 1 in 816 odds of winning.
What sets Bitmia apart from the instant dice sites is the fact that it has the ability and will eventually become a positive expected value game. We're actually flirting with the idea of tying the ticket price to the jackpot in a way that its EV (expected value) is at all times positive, no matter how big or small the jackpot is. Given the fact that the game "resets" itself every day, my gut tells me that we should have enough time to fill the "booster fund" for whenever the jackpot is won (that is unless a heck load of tickets are sold every day). Feedback on this idea is very welcome.
We're in the process of adding more ELI5 FAQ's, so I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have :)
@_date: 2015-02-26 16:44:48
0% currently.
@_date: 2015-02-27 00:28:05
We've seeded it ourselves :)
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:41:43
Okay, since you insist, let’s get through them, shall we:
1.  - enough said
2. It’s more of a reddit post than a lottery, isn’t it?
3. Same ^ + dead
4. “A random number is generated by Twitter”
5. It’s a dice game
So no, still not understanding your point.
@_date: 2015-02-20 20:45:37
lol, okay :)
@_date: 2015-02-26 19:16:17
On average, we must sell about 816 tickets for somebody to win the jackpot, so considering the fact that someone won it in the very first week of us pushing it live (~90 tickets sold), yeah, the winner made us seed the jackpot again :)
@_date: 2015-02-26 18:52:50


Well, it's quite simple really: 50% of the revenue coming from ticket sales "rolls over" onto the current jackpot thus increasing it in the next drawing (so if you buy a ticket say, today, then half of what you paid will be added to the current jackpot tomorrow) and the other 50% are added to the "booster fund" which will become the new jackpot whenever the old one is won.
@_date: 2015-02-26 16:16:55
Donated. We've been inspired by to launch [Bitmia]( The blockchain is too good of a source for random not to be used in a lottery/raffle :)
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:08:43
This is why we're completely transparent and put our reputations at stake.
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:16:39
Good luck! :)
And it's not a scam. We have our [OTC accounts]( in good standing and we're doing this for fun!
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:13:33
It's live :)
