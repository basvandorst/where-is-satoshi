What use is there for bitcoin in a real world application?
Gold is used for a number of real world applications that gives gold a hard floor on price.
Comparing the two is also idiocy as you might easily compare gold and carrots or btc to exhaust pipes

There is a difference between real world value and application in these terms.
Bitcoin is not used to produce anything tangible, unlike gold which is used on industrial applications all over the world.
An example being should gold disappear overnight it would have real world implications for the production of thousand of products outside of financial concerns.  Should bitcoin disappear overnight there would be little to no real world non financial implications.
Perhaps reading the comment and understanding it before accusing of ignorance would be useful

Those physical computer networks that share data all over the world are often the very backbone of industrial and other real world applications.
Not sure when I proclaimed bitcoin useless.  I stated that you should not compare gold and bitcoin.  You appear to have disregarded what I wrote, made up your own version and are arguing against that.  
*Currently* bitcoins uses are incredibly limited, in part due to how new it is, how volatile it can be and the lack of real world application.  I'm not trying to read the future here, simply commenting on the current situation.
Ask yourself this. With the exception of people losing their investment what are the implications of bitcoin disappearing tomorrow as things currently stand. 
Please note I say bitcoin, not block chain.
