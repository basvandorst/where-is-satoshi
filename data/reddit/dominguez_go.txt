You and 90% of people around you probably alive and literate thanks to the state and its little bit of "socialism". But hey, so evil.

Most of the companies mentioned precarice society more than benefit it with shitty jobs, unaffordable rents for the locals and monopolistic behaviors but yeah definitely something big is happening...

It was announced like an useful currency with low fees (not many) years ago, not digital gold. That was the project and that's what is in danger. Even if you don't want to buy coffee with BTC, it is very important for its growth to be able to use it instead of money, not just in some cases. One year ago we could buy cheap things just like with the currencies you mentioned, and there are things we can do to maintain that without compromising security.

Yeah you are, but customers are not charged 5$ to buy even the smallest thing and that's what makes them able to buy. The problem is not a %, is a fixed "revolutionary tax".

But how is it a "protection" if those transactioms are making bitcoin almost useless for the average user?  I mean bitcoin doesn't have to protect itself from more transactions, but for the current transactions to make the fees so high...

If you simplify things so much they can turn against you. People could simplify as much as you and say bitcoin is only good for buying drugs, fraud and cybercrime in general and to speculate.
