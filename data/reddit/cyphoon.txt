Sending you some info on some exchanges via DM. :D
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:57:33
LOL sure, me sharing tips is a scam...
The reason I send PMs is due to Subreddit rules regarding links to exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:30:42
No prob, shoot me a PM.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:36:02
You got it!

Once again...The reason I send PMs is due to Subreddit rules regarding links to exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:18:26
Why not? Just a matter of time.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:30:14
Bizzare, thank you for the heads up...shoot me a PM, I'll share it with you. It got removed previously due to links per subreddit rules.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:24:12
HAHAHA wow...
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:23:03

@_date: 2017-12-28 20:26:16
No probzzzz :D
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:18:30
Ahhh interesting, likely due to previous posts where I shared links to exchanges which is apparently not allowed in most subreddits. Just got your PM.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:17:58
Just sent you a dm with my recommendations :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:45:53
done :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:04:09
of course! PMing you now.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:05:07
Because the post gets deleted or banned based on the links in my descriptions...Subreddit rules, ya know?
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:00:13
Sending you tips about how to transfer for free. Cheers.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:57:38
PM'd you.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:21:11
This occurred due to the Bitcoin Cash fork. You should have received BCH equal to your BTC holdings.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:00:52
I gotcha, sending you a lil crypto guide now. Cheers!

Bitcoin prices vary depending on the exchange you're buying it on.
This has to do with several things, including volume on an exchange.
Pisani also says we need improved infrastructure to help align bitcoin prices on different exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:04:36
Sending you a few tips to get started.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:04:58
No probs!
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:36:55

Sending you a message with some tips :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:14:00
I gotcha, I'd just take it slow. Ease into buying a bit of BTC first and watching how it changes and how other coins change based on it.
From there, then you'll branch out to other exchanges and coins naturally.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:44:24
Like 33% BTC
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:22:01
Sure just shoot me a pm with whatever you're curious about.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:48:38
Definitely, take precautions to keep your coins safe.
Some key points about  on $Crypto:
- Have a different mail for each exchange/account.
- Activate 2FA everywhere. Print the recovery codes.
- Keep the passwords on paper.
- Don't trade using public WiFi's.
- Bookmark the exchanges/wallets, avoid third links.

Don't mind at all! Just pm'd you.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:24:02
