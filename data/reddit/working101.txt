Question, and I may have missed this in the white paper, but is this intended to replace the current physical infrastructure as well? Currently the bitcoin protocol runs on the existing internet. Companies like comcast and verizon control the physical lines. It is not a far stretch for them to say block network traffic going to and from the bitcoin network. 
My question is, what is the infrastructure for this? In my mind, it would need to be completely wireless and separate from existing controlled infrastructure. How do we jump the oceans and land gaps between cities? 
Perhaps, this autonomous corporation should keep a portions of funds for itself to be spent on furthuring the infrastructure. Whether it be launching a satellite, or drones or whatever.

It because he played the "fool" on that seventies show for so long. And then made "Dude wheres my car." I dont much care for him but stuff like the Butterfly Effect shows he can act. And yeah, he sounds pretty smart. Bummer he is still stereotyped as a fool.

Its never going to be too late to get in. Bitcoin is so much more than an investment opportunity. It is the model for how all future online transactions are going to take place.

Im saying, they estimated that he made 80 million in sales from the site. Where the bitcoin that represent that 80 million are, is anyone's guess. The coins they do have were what was in the silkroad payment system.

Mining has no other purpose but to verify the integrity of the blockchain. You could use the cpu cycles in your computer to fold or do seti research alongside the mining program but no. The computing power of the bitcoin network only functions to verify the integrity of the blockchain.

Ah. I missed that part then. I thought the timelines were closer. Its entirely possible they imaged his computers at that time however if that was the case then your last statement... why didnt he wipe everything. With the kind of money he was pulling in, he could have easily just... poof. 
Although it sounds like he was driven by much more than monetary gain.
@_date: 2013-10-22 15:10:51
Personally. I find paying for stuff online 100 times easier than paying by credit card. For starters, there is zero risk to me. If a third party intercepts my 1 time address im using to send you btc then i dont give a shit. 
Secondly, entering my shipping address and then pasting in an address is easier than entering all of the credit card information. 
The list goes on. Mainly its about security and convenience. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 15:39:52
Except bitcoin mining is a little more involved than just putting some generic client on your machine. Which is exactly what this software does. It does absolutely zero tweaks to optimize the hashrate and minimize heat. It seems cool however bitcoin mining is hard on hardware. Even moreso when it is being done with a client that is not configured correctly.

I suppose they could throw you in Jail. A favorite way for the government to punish people is to just slap them with a fine and pull it straight out of your bank account. With bitcoin though.... good fucking luck just confiscating it. My thoughts are if they cant punish you monetarily, they will physically come after you. In which case, you better have a good disappearing plan. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 17:37:49
The thing is, the longer they wait to attack with a 51% the harder its going to be. Eventually, and maybe its already there, the nsa simply will not be able to spin up the gear to attack the network. I know they get a shit ton of funding but at some point, somewhere, the funding will be an issue for this sort of thing. It isn't unlimited by any means. 
@_date: 2013-07-10 12:12:37
I am really interested to know how they 'siezed' the bitcoin. Did they physically take his wallet.dat file? Was it in an online account somewhere? What!
@_date: 2013-05-29 18:52:45
I guess what I am saying is, the NSA can't just up and flip a switch and perform a 51 percent attack. Even the NSA, with its billions and billions suffers from the glacier pace of a bureaucracy. The 2 or 3 or 5 years or whatever it will take for them to get all this equipment going is enough time for us to lobby hard. 
My point was basically that the NSA cant just magically print chips and perform a 51 percent attack tomorrow, or next week, or even next month. 
@_date: 2013-08-07 18:25:15
It's true. The IRS can only audit what they have available on paper. If your addresses are anonymous and none of your bitcoin earnings hits a traceable bank account, there really is no way for them to know.

Thats not quite how local bitcoins works. You transfer ahead of time into an escrow account. The only thing you do when you meet them is unlock the funds.

My honest guess is that when they arrested him on the Fake ID stuff, they confiscated all his computers and stuff. A forensic analysis of his personal computer could have led to the Silk Road server. If this is indeed the case, it begs the question as to why his personal computers weren't encrypted. A forensic analysis doesn't get very far if the evidence is random fucking numbers. 
@_date: 2013-10-11 15:47:51
Sorry to break it to you dude but... they dont put out that much heat :( They get warm but certainly not anything like a gpu miner. and yes the internals are shit. 
@_date: 2013-10-17 11:28:47
Bitcoins that went into the silkroad eskrow account were put through a tumbler system where they were shuffled around different addresses in order to mask the true origin and destination of the bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 17:16:18
You should stop using Mt. Gox for starters. I haven't looked at the price of bitcoin on mt gox or an affiliated ticker for almost 4 months. BTCe and CampBX are where its at. Or tradehill or any number of exchanges NOT Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:17:14
Sure there is. You are helping to support the network. Contribute to network security and help keep things decentralized. There would be no bitcoin if people didnt mine. People should be thankful that there are people willing to mine at break even or a loss simply to support the network. 
@_date: 2013-07-10 14:21:42
Ok. That still doesnt explain how the dea siezed the bitcoin. To sieze something means to physically take. Unless they either went after an online account, or confiscated all of his flash drives that contained all of the wallet.dat files, then the dea couldnt have seized shit. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 14:47:40

Bought dinner at burger king. Also bought a couple block eruptors off of bitmit. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 21:04:57
I actually dont think any miners have to register. Especially not if you are mining in a pool. Ive mined a shit ton of bitcoin and my rigs have never personally found a block. I just got paid because i contributed to the pool. So who printed the money? Did I by virtue of being in the pool or is the miner who specifically unlocks the block? What about the bitcoin that I get from transaction fees?
I don't think the FinCEN guidlines are clear about miners at all. I think that there will need to be court cases involving this to figure it out. Because, if I as a miner never find a block but still get paid by a pool, did I generate any bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:15:43
If I am not mistaken, he was arrested in San Fransisco. This warrant was issued in the State of New York. It is possible that the new york warrant was written up after the events in san Fransisco once the connection was made.

That doesnt mean you cant use it for local transactions. I would suggest doing so.

They subpoenad the VPN provider for the connection logs pertaining to his account. Once they tracked him to the Cafe in San Fransisco, they could probably tell which vpn service he was using. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:20:20
Actually. The block eruptors imo are cheap enough that it would be worth picking up a couple and leaving running all the time. With the way the exchange rates are going, there is a pretty good chance those fractions of a bitcent you are mining will be worth something. 
Edit: I shoudl mention that I have been finding them on places like coingig and bitmit for between 12 and 16 dollars. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:56:47
No, he was sloppy. He used his personal email account a number of times to both recruit developers and inquire about building hidden services. He didnt even bother to make a throwaway for each forum registration. For someone who was doing something so risky and paranoid, im surprised at this. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:21:10
Um. Yes. It does work that way. We arent talking about the bitcoin market here. We are talking about the network itself. The technology which allows bitcoin to happen. If people dont mine then transactions dont get processed. If enough people dont mine then the network is less secure, and transactions take longer to process. If only 2 people mine then the network becomes insecure because 2 people hold the power over the entire blockchain. If a lot of people mine then that power over the blockchain diminishes rapidly. 
We want people mining for the sake of mining.  
The more people that mine helps the network regardless of whether or not they are making any money.

@_date: 2013-05-22 21:23:24
I think that miners should challenge it it court. I really don't think FinCEN considered any of the technical details on this matter.
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:30:14
How would one go about tainting their own coins? How also, can we personally make what these fuckheads are doing, essentially useless?
@_date: 2013-05-22 20:58:38
Thats not necessarily true. Ive been mining for about two years and never as a solo miner. I have never personally found a bitcoin block. I have found 1 litecoin block out of the thousands our pool has mined. My argument, and it is the correct argument, is that my compensation came from the pool for the work my miners put in. If I ever have to go to court or whatever because FinCen thinks I broke the rules, this is my stance. 
@_date: 2013-09-04 17:46:24
Hopefully not too long. 
@_date: 2013-10-16 20:50:22
I am not sure they have his wallet.dat file. From what I gather, the wallet hey have belonged to silkroad and was money that was currently awaiting the tumbling system. Either way this is going to be an interesting case.
