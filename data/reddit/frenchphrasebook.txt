As in [magic the gathering]( - a card game? did it use to be a website dedicated to swapping cards? Does the term Mt have any relevance to its new purpose? and is that pronunced 'mount'.

so why was there a report earlier this year that prisons in China forced their patrons to gold farm in WoW. Maybe this policy has changed.

The thing is, if you are are aware of [firstbits]( the bitcoin address I had could be identified by its first four digits. This is rare now. It means I only had to give out the first four digits because no other bitcoin address has those digits or will ever have them. 
Anyway I'm pretty sure there would be no way of getting that wallet as if someone has a wallet once, then they will always have it if they keep a copy and you can't be assured they won't or am I wrong?

just supposing they are legit, would it be feasible to get the wallet I was using with them, even if all the bitcoins are gone? I just liked the number.
