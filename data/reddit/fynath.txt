Probably relevant info.

It took me over two hours to get my first confirmation last night. Hopefully yours will pop up soon!
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:40:24
Nope. It's been almost an hour and a half and it hasn't shown up in blockchain at all. No confirmations.

Yeah, I transferred mine out as well but haven't received them yet either, and I don't see any activity for my address on blockchain. I withdrew about 33 minutes ago. Bleh.
edit: at about 55 minutes and I still haven't seen anything. Sure hope I get those ~15 BTC.

I just got mine. It took about 2 hours and 10 minutes for it to finally appear in Blockchain.

It's not really that hard. If you're living in an area with a relatively low cost of living and are making 50k+ a year, you can afford to make some pretty large loan payments and live more comfortably than you ever did in college, and still have a fair amount of money left over.

I really doubt you are going to make any kind of profit off GPU mining at this point. I stopped mining with my 7950s yesterday. I was getting 450-500 Mhash per card and I was making about .001 BTC per block per card on Slush's pool.

I would have had them in my wallet if I had not been planning on selling them soon.
Oh well.

Same here.

I think one of my favorite things that has come about because of bitcoin is the bitcointip bot. It is really fun to see people just giving money away to inspired comments and helpful posters. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:01:55
That is what I'm hoping for. I'm not *super* worried about it yet.

This shows up at the top of all of Bitfloor's pages now:
"Trading will be suspended at 6 PM EST on 2013.04.17. We ask that all users finish any trades they wish to complete and cancel any open trades. Please do not deposit additional funds into your account at this time."

Haha, you are the best, sir. Thank you!

Getting rid of some old paper wallets? :)
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:36:23
Seems to be happening to a lot of us.
