I've had a purchase pending from my USD wallet with them for 10 days that I made when everything was going crazy. All of my bank transfers went through, but that one didn't.
I've been in contact with tech support for the past couple of days now, and they've been responsive enough for my tastes...of course they have yet to resolve the issue, but they say they are looking into it. Not great, but I'm not ready to give up hope yet.
So far I've been satisfied overall with coinbase, as an entry point for a cryptonewb like myself
@_date: 2019-07-12 21:05:54
No, actually, I didn't miss that post from 5 days ago. I read it and it was interesting, but it's the exception not the rule.
I'm just calling it like I see it. There is very little discussion of the tech here and you pointing out a post from 5 days ago and the other guy linking to r/bitcointechnology sub that has 2 month old posts on the front page isn't exactly disproving my point.
@_date: 2019-07-13 07:29:42
See now, that's more like it! I don't usually view subs directly, so I missed that it was stickied. It was quite interesting. Surprising that it took 12 hours for someone to point it out
@_date: 2019-07-12 20:53:50
That sub is definitely more what I am looking for, but it's a little...inactive. The front page has posts from 2 months ago.
I find the fact that situations so rarely warrant discussion of the tech to be troubling in general, considering how much development the crypto space needs before it can truly be ready for prime time.
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:08:28
The only reason I follow this sub is to take a read on sentiment. There is virtually no discussion of the technology here, just memes and nonsense.
@_date: 2019-07-13 00:48:22
Well that's the problem, my dude. There's no tech to post about because as far as I can tell bitcoin is a dead project coasting on name recognition.
Edit: Or you know, feel free to prove me wrong.

Did you scroll through my comments enough to find the last time I commented here? I went back 2 weeks before I got bored, so I think it's more than a bit disingenuous to characterize me as doing nothing but complaining.
Edit: found my most recent comments here. It was a month ago, and I was not complaining about the quality of the sub. 
Frankly I think the reason that there is little discussion of the tech is that there is little advancement to discuss. Meanwhile if I go over to r/ethdev there are all sorts of projects being promoted and talked about. Brave Browser just released BAT rewards for Android yesterday and I've earned $1.00 from looking at ads. That's cool. Is there anything equivalent going on in bitcoin? I don't think that there is.
@_date: 2019-07-13 01:35:07
So what's going on in bitcoin tech news? What are the latest projects being built with bitcoin? Because nobody seems to be able to tell me.
@_date: 2019-07-13 03:03:44
An idiot or troll for not knowing that exists? If you say so. At least someone finally answered my question instead of just deflecting and attacking. I was seriously beginning to think that the emperor had no clothes.
@_date: 2019-07-12 20:55:30
How would I add to the "conversation"? Lol moon? Make fun of Craig Wright? Talk about how stupid shitcoiners are?
There's nothing interesting being discussed here.

I did short it. Worked out pretty dang well too
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:11:07
Hmm good point. Guess I'll keep my water heater for a while longer 
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:52:23
That's ingenious...out of curiosity, how does the power consumption compare to a regular electric water heater? 
@_date: 2018-05-15 23:44:49
So you're basically using the hot tub as a giant heat sink? 
How long until you break even on the cost of building the rig? 
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:04:56
A quick Google search tells me that a standard electric water heater is 3800 watts, and the antminer s9 takes 1372, so some back of the envelope math suggests that this is actually more efficient than a water heater
Absolutely brilliant! 
@_date: 2019-03-27 17:02:08
Why do you have so few monitors? 
@_date: 2019-03-09 15:01:05
Most crypto articles are like that tbh 
@_date: 2019-08-10 21:41:15
And you are a Nazi apologist. I'd rather be branded as a "crazy person" than a Nazi any day of the week.
@_date: 2019-08-10 22:07:28
Hey, if this offends you you should probably take a good look in the mirror and ask yourself if you're the kind of person you want to be.
@_date: 2019-08-10 22:21:53
I am outside.
@_date: 2019-08-10 21:32:42
Too bad about the Nazi memes that are all over this sub. Y'all can help bitcoin by distancing yourselves from it as much as possible.
@_date: 2019-08-10 21:44:10
Good one. I have been skewered by your rapier wit.
@_date: 2019-08-10 21:38:54
As do you..."boy".
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:27:58
It's not a good look for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-10 23:11:40
Neat echo in here.
@_date: 2018-06-30 00:59:40
Shh...you're ruining the hopium 
@_date: 2019-08-10 21:37:12
Thanks for self identifying.
@_date: 2019-08-11 00:05:31
Right. Y'all are in here blowing up my inbox to call me everything but the child of God, but sure, you can call me a snowflake if it makes you feel better. I will take that hot chocolate though.
@_date: 2019-08-10 21:36:14
Oh, but it does. Use the image if you want, but it makes you look like a Nazi.
@_date: 2019-08-10 21:35:39
Uh...this one? Pepe the frog is a well known character for white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and the MAGA crowd (collectively: Nazis)
@_date: 2019-08-11 01:44:31
Oof. Looks like your Nazi meme got deleted. Better luck next time.
@_date: 2019-06-07 04:16:00
That explains why Earnst and Young (one of the big 4 auditing firms) is building a platform for secure private transactions on the ethereum blockchain...
@_date: 2019-02-27 03:50:02
@_date: 2019-06-07 04:20:20
Oh? And why not?
@_date: 2019-08-10 21:39:36
You should do yourself the same favor.
@_date: 2019-06-01 18:21:31
You seem like a smart person.
@_date: 2019-06-07 17:20:14
No answer hmm?
@_date: 2019-06-07 04:18:17
With businesses using it for private and secure transactions?
@_date: 2019-04-05 00:43:36
I gotta be honest all the dumb money in this thread is making me quite bullish 
@_date: 2019-04-05 00:42:21
Wow that sounds great! Throw in a t-shirt and I'm in! 
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:15:43
Nowhere. It's a scam. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 00:22:47
Yeah these dudes are just ripe for another Bitconnect
@_date: 2019-04-05 01:41:07
Like I said to the other guy: I don't care what you think, so why do you care what I think? You like the shirt? Buy one. I think it's a scam. End of story. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 00:48:56
Hey thanks for checking out my bonsai. I'm pretty proud of it
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:34:52
Your comment has been submitted to the appropriate committee 
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:16:11
More erudite commentary from the peanut gallery 
@_date: 2019-04-05 00:05:09
Yeah Idk, a lot of these rubes seem convinced that this shirt is legit. Hopefully the dude spamming links throughout the thread is able to drum up some business. I wish him the best of luck 
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:32:01
Whatever shirt you bought or didn't buy has no bearing on the fact that the shirt in this image has been photoshopped 
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:49:57
Yeah I don't know why they would waste their time like that. Good question. It's clearly photoshopped though.
There actually was a link in this thread to buy "this shirt" earlier, but it got deleted. I wonder why.
Anyway, you're boring and dumb and I don't like talking to you. Goodbye. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:08:16
Dang, almost got those letters to look like they were following the folds of that wrinkly, stretched out t-shirt
Makes me wonder if maybe I should try selling scam t-shirts on reddit. There's clearly a market for it 
@_date: 2019-04-05 01:06:04
Dudes are getting extremely heated about this t-shirt. It's weird tbh 
@_date: 2019-04-04 22:42:16
Not everything on the internet is fake, but this definitely is. I don't honestly know why you guys are white knighting over a t-shirt 
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:33:54
Oooh, what a zinger! I have been skewered by your rapier wit! 
@_date: 2019-04-05 02:07:14
Hey man if you like the shirt that much there's a guy spamming links to it in this thread. Go get yours. Definitely not a scam. You should send him money. 
@_date: 2019-04-09 17:15:20
That's what I've been doing. Lowered my breakeven point by 60%
@_date: 2019-04-05 02:00:11
This is gonna blow your mind, but just because you had to Google it doesn't mean I did 
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:39:12
Actually you know what? You're right. You should find some random bot linking to a place to buy this shirt and send them some money
@_date: 2019-04-05 00:41:23
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:42:02
Ok, go ahead duder. I'm not stopping you from getting a t-shirt printed 
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:35:46
The t-shirt is clearly photoshopped, dumbass
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:37:40
Oop! There it is, the link to purchase this totally real and not-a-scam t-shirt. Go buy it everyone. Make sure you put your credit card information in. Mouthbreathers. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 01:37:03
Look man, I don't care what you think, so why do you care what I think? If you like the t-shirt and think it's real, then put your money where your mouth is and buy one. there's a guy spamming links for it in this thread. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 00:24:35
Either way, you couldn't pay me to click on that link. Not for all the tea in China 
@_date: 2019-04-03 16:59:33
Lol...crypto homies. As if any of my friends want to hear me talk about crypto 
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:31:46
You can transfer your coins from coinbase to coinbase pro for free if you want to trade. Back when I was still new to the space and foolish and naive enough to think that I could trade successfully I was using my phone to do it. In the end I wound up coming out ahead with all my trading, but it wasn't worth the heart palpitations and acid reflux, so I stopped gambling with my crypto and now I just hodl and dca
@_date: 2019-04-05 00:45:58
Look dude I don't really care what you do with your money. There's a dude spamming links for this shirt in this very thread so go give him your private keys, I'm totally sure you'll get a very real t-shirt in return 
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:31:12
Vote however you want. You can clearly see that the text has been photoshopped in
@_date: 2019-01-09 22:46:40
Sure, I hold some LTC, but I had to unsub from the litecoin sub because I just couldn't take the cringey obsession with "the flappening" anymore 
@_date: 2018-11-18 00:42:55
Yeah same. The only thing stupider than buying in at the ATH (like I did) would be selling when I'm sitting at around 25% of my initial investment. I'd rather see it go to zero than sell now 
@_date: 2019-01-13 20:39:11
PoE is an excellent game. One of very few that have done microtransacrions right. Super cool that they're accepting bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-01-13 21:31:27
Stash tabs were the only thing I bought when I was playing 
@_date: 2019-01-09 22:40:29
Then we get to hear all of the litecoiners crow about "the flappening" as if doing better than bcash is some sort of achievement 
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:11:25
Tbh this is kind of brilliant 
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:26:38
Someone's gonna carjack you and hold you hostage 
@_date: 2018-04-07 20:38:02
Lol oh noes! My feelers! Stahp hurting dem! 
@_date: 2018-04-07 20:24:46
You should get rid of those stupid vanity plates. Makes you a mark, and also makes you look like a tool. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 20:34:39
Oooo I saw that! You said a bad word! It's even funnier to me that you deleted it instantly 
@_date: 2018-04-07 20:31:00
I could ask you the same question 
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:57:39
As others have said, if you can't handle a 12.5% drop then you should not invest in bitcoin, because you will panic sell when it does inevitably drop. 
If all you can afford to lose is $250 then that is how much you can afford to invest. Put it in a cold storage wallet and forget about it for 2 years. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:23:19
Should I start coming in fear instead? 
@_date: 2018-04-07 20:05:06
Because you're advertising that you have bitcoin to the whole world, and people getting kidnapped and tortured for their bitcoin is an actual thing that is happening?
I don't even check my blockfolio in public 
@_date: 2018-12-09 18:08:26
Oh for sure. Nobody likes melty bitcoins 
@_date: 2019-05-28 17:48:16
I'll tell you something...scrolling down r/bitcoin and then scrolling down r/ethereum makes me quite bullish for ethereum. There's way too much nonsense here.
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:56:09
Gotta leave room for all the bitcoins 
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:52:29
Why do people always assume that if you don't like their shitty idols you must have been tricked by "haters"? Yes I've heard about as much from him as I could stomach, and that was more than enough. All red-pillers are morons. 
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:12:59
So far so good, champ
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:56:53
You can do all of the hand waving about nuanced discussions and groupthink you want, but pedophilia is wrong. Milo can still buy bitcoin if he wants. You can sell him some. No private company is required to do business with him. Free markets, capitalism in action, etc.
@_date: 2019-05-29 17:20:47
So that's like...an advertisement about how great it is to develop with bitcoin.
Water cooler level conversion is what I am looking for, ie here's a cool application for bitcoin and a few paragraphs about what it does (or will do). Unfortunately most times this sub doesn't even rise to the level of water cooler, but stops somewhere around bathroom wall
@_date: 2019-05-24 04:23:46
Turns out I'm into vore, so a giant douche sounds pretty hawt
@_date: 2019-05-31 17:51:03
I asked a similar question the other day and got a similar non-answer.
As far as I can tell bitcoin's tech has stagnated and the real development of blockchain is happening on ethereum.
@_date: 2018-12-28 01:03:38
Incels: Debate me or you are wrong
Me: But I don't care what you think...
Incels: Haha! Victory!
Me: Ok.
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:06:44
My man, your head is so far up your own ass you could French kiss yourself.
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:23:36
Interesting to hear defending pedophilia referred to as a "political belief". He's even too toxic for Breitbart, and that's really saying something.
@_date: 2019-05-29 17:59:35
Right it's not a complete wasteland. Just today there is a thing about watchtowers that is pretty interesting, but I feel like this is a messaging problem for bitcoin. I can name like 10 ethereum projects just off the top of my head. With bitcoin I know about lightning and segwit and that's really it
I like to tinker with things I'm interested in, and I've found while it was easy to find a solidity tutorial and muck around with some smart contracts, the barrier to entry for bitcoin has been prohibitive
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:22:30
Sorry, where should I go to find out about technology being developed with bitcoin? I can go to r/ethdev or r/ethereum to learn about new projects on the ethereum blockchain, so what is the equivalent for bitcoin? Because all I ever see is stuff about Craig Wright and Roger Ver, and how terrible Coinbase is
@_date: 2018-12-17 02:03:18
This exact thing happened to me 
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:30:27
Idk, I think pretty slowly 
@_date: 2018-12-28 01:17:23
Feel free to ignore it dude. I came here to say that Jordan Peterson is trash, not debate with red-pillers 
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:04:53
Jordan Peterson is trash. This is bad publicity
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:53:16
Do they sell anything else? Those are some empty looking shelves 
@_date: 2018-12-28 00:19:44
All of it. I don't owe you an explanation. Jordan Peterson is trash. Cry about it. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 01:58:10
Incels getting triggered left and right 
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:03:03
@_date: 2018-12-28 01:41:04
So just wondering when that whole ignoring my opinion thing is going to happen...will it be after this comment or the next one?
