You're required to pay taxes in USD (or any other currency that the local Government decides) because that's what the Government decides. This issue isn't related to the argument of setting up a VPS to 'help' a currency.  If the Government asked you to set up a VPS server to enable them to run the economy the way they do, then I think they would find a lot of people opting out.

Running this node is not the same as having a bank account - as the post admits, this install is not hardened enough to be a personal wallet. However, starting a bank account with a bank just involves filling in a form. Quite different things.

I know a guy who was in a similar position and he even asked me if he could buy some from me (at the time I wasn't selling). I felt for him because he's intelligent and really wanting to add something to the bitcoin community, but unable to join in. It is a bit of a barrier in the community, but all digital communities suffer this lack of access if you don't have the services or hardware to join in. I would be interested to hear how we could make it even easier to access bitcoins.

I really think that if a currency requires 'help' by people doing this then it is in trouble.
