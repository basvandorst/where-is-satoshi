Good point about the HDD option. I didn't check this for VPS. About your laptop.. You are running it 24 hours and you can access it from anywhere if you want?

Thanks for the reply! You're right about running it on own PC, but I don't know how realistic it would be letting it run 24 hours or as background service.

Ok thanks for the honesty. I'm diving more into this difficult subject then.

Agreed, HODL is by far the best strategy!

Agree, just at each dip I'm accumulating more Satoshi's

Ok thanks for the info. Will use Bitstamp as an alternative then!

Interesting subject, the  psychology  of the masses. Also 'ordinary people' trust their neighbour more who buys at 25K , then someone on the web who has researched it for many years...

Bitcoin as digital gold is the perfect hedge against inflation, quantitave easing and gives you purchasing power in the future. I'm 42, not a millennial, but I also prefer trusting math over trusting establishment.

I don't get reddit right. I sure did put an url, but anyway here it is. [ Also, these 4 are hardware wallets which I believe are best :)

A new word for "Bitcoin Hodler".. ;)

Two possible reasons for this rise in price:
\- Dropgold campaign by Barry Silbert's company
\- Fidelity platform will trade top 10 crypto's in near future

The 'new whales' coming into this market are willing to pay fees (5%) to buy in large..
