Keep in mind that a specific paper wallet that has been used to send bitcoins is no longer *as* secure as an unused wallet. (Because by sending bitcoin from a wallet you will have broadcasted it's public key.) After you try sending money from your paper wallet, the best practice is to use another one to store your bitcoin.

You might find the introduction method in [this video]( helpful (starting from why do we even need money and what is the purpose of using money). In addition, I would recommend to start by pointing something out: 
If I email you a picture, *I still have that picture*. So how can I "email" you something that has value, *and not have it anymore*? This is the problem Bitcoin solves. 
I also don't think mining is relevant until people ask "Well where are the credits for the protocol generated, and who gets them?" I'd suggest moving mining to later slides or not even mentioning it in the presentation, leaving it as additional slides at the end of the presentation in case the audience asks about it.
Also on slide 6; 'very low fees' are independent of the amount of bitcoin transferred. Doesn't matter if you send a dollar or a million, same fee.
On slide 8, instead of showing the Subway picture you could show a screenshot (of your local area maybe) from [coinmap](
I'd also recommend a comparison between cash. The *owner* is responsible for the cash, just like bitcoin.

Looking at this link: 


The oversimplification here is so bad that it's offensive. Literally millions of dollars is spent in research and development of reactor designs to lower the risk of accident to acceptable levels. 'Acceptable levels' is sometimes measured by risk of death per worker per year, and is benchmarked against other sectors (transportation, coal plants, etc.). The standards for nuclear industry are higher both in implementation and practice. An airplane can crash in Super Bowl and kills tens of thousands, but we consider the risk and accommodate. We don't take an anti-airplane stance.


What to do with the nuclear waste is a political problem, not technical. See France for an example of a country that has no nuclear waste problem. The US was going to permanently store it's waste in Yucca Mountain, but it fell through.


Citation needed. Literally every material in nature is radioactive.


This is misleading in so many levels. It manages to sneak in "nuclear is extremely dangerous" without any backing. It assumes that nuclear power is "greenwashed" and other energy sources present objective arguments. It assumes renewable energy sources can power industry and can follow load (can increase energy production when people turn on their electronics). It assumes that investment in renewables can be easily made and the power easily distributed literally across continents (where you can most easily produce power is usually where there is least demand for power).


This is very USA-centric. Investment in new nuclear plants have stagnated over the past decades, perhaps mostly due to natural gas prices. Think space exploration, who *would* invest in that, and who *should* invest in it?


It is well known that first-of-a-kind nuclear reactor designs have cost overruns. I invite someone to do an analysis on big projects (skyscrapers, bridges, dams, airplanes, etc.) and look at what are typical initial estimate vs final cost.


This is a red herring. We're talking about civilian nuclear power. However, I have a counter example: Ever since nuclear weapons were invented there has not been a major battle between nuclear states.


This is silly, there are many countries that have nuclear reactors without nuclear weapons. Research in nuclear also increases the knowledge on *detecting* nuclear weapons production. If others are making the weapons we will be more likely to find out and do something about it. I would argue nuclear power therefore increases our national security.


You have picked a side on an issue more than three decades ago. Imagine the technology we had back then and what we have now. Nuclear energy is getting even better and safer as time goes on. (Even back then I would argue anti-nuclear is bad.)
Arguing against nuclear is very short-sighted without presenting alternatives. Renewable energies cannot be an alternative to nuclear as they stand right now. The wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine. The places where wind blows a lot and sun shines very bright aren't the places humans want to live. Bringing electricity to them costs a lot due to the inefficiencies of power lines. Industrial level energy storage could greatly improve the utility of renewable energies, but if we had industrial scale energy storage then nuclear would also become much cheaper (I can explain this later if people are interested.)
This is why I think "green"peace is doing more harm than good by taking an anti-nuclear position.

The US dollar is *the* world reserve currency, so if you're using it you will not have any compelling reasons to use bitcoin. However, this doesn't mean that bitcoin can't be better than USD. The dollar has been around for a very long time, and has incredible infrastructure built to support it. So comparing the infrastructure behind the dollar to the infant bitcoin infrastructure is not a very objective comparison. ("You don't have a good reason to use bitcoin yet.")
Most of the hype behind bitcoin is due to it's potential. 
Potential: Something in the future.
So if you want to compare bitcoin not to any other fiat currency but specifically to USD, then I think we should begin speculating on what's possible using bitcoin. Literally all of the functionality of dollars can be built using bitcoin, and cheaper. 
For the individual:
* Credit card fees are high because they cover fraud and theft. Bitcoin can replace all credit cards since you already need an internet connection to make a payment using cards. Bitcoin offers better convenience for these online payments. (However, currently merchants cover the credit card fees which makes using bitcoin more expensive. It's easy to make a case that merchants will begin offering discounts for payments with bitcoin.)
* Banks have fees. You will be able to have a service like Paypal or a software like a wallet to store your value. 
* Peer-to-peer transactions. Currently it's not easy to electronically pay a friend. Bitcoin solves this problem by default.
* Transaction fees are by no means flat in dollars. Sending money internationally comes with a big cost (the most relevant example I can think of is foreign students receiving tuition money from their parents). Bitcoin doesn't care where you are physically. It's the same fee.
* Limited supply of the currency makes investments easy. Just hold bitcoin, you'll store your value as long as people are using it.
* Privacy.
For businesses:
The reasons for the individuals apply for the businesses. However I believe there are more compelling reasons for merchant adoption.
* Transaction fees! A 1% decrease in transaction fees can literally save a business. Remember, this decrease doesn't mean about 1% increase in profits, it would be a significantly higher increase since revenue =/= profit. (Also, donations and micro-transactions .)
* Transaction speed. Checks can bounce, deposits can take days. Businesses can really benefit from having cash (BTC) now.
* Software. Businesses use accounting software and banks to pay their suppliers and employees. Accounting costs can be significantly decreased by using bitcoin and a free open-source business-accounting software. Imagine, um, say a company that sells paper to businesses. The company can automate their bonuses so that every time an employee makes a sale, they receive their cut. The possibilities on making smart companies seem to be endless. (I'd like to highlight the main idea behind of this bullet point: All of these can still be done using software and dollars, but it would cost more.)
* Investing and startups. You know what internet did to news and entertainment industries? Everyone suddenly had free access to a global audience. Random guy down the street could start shooting his standup show and share it with the world without anyone's permission. Bitcoin allows the same thing for businesses. "Hai evry1 I has dis gr8 idea 4 a business, gimme moniez!" guy can be funded with bitcoin. Probably less than 0.1% percent of these people will end up successful, but I bet there are some internet giants that started that way.

Here are my notes from the talk:
 
Based on an important study, the top most effective ways of spending money to solve world problems are spending it on: 1. Removing trade barriers, 2. Healthcare, and 3. Education. However, spending your money on "removing trade barriers is over 30 times more effective than any other intervention." This is "because all problems you want to solve requires resources. ...  When you have wealth creation, then you have the resources to address all the other problems."
Best ways to build wealth are:
1. Securing property rights ("who owns what" 2/3 of the people don't have it) 
2. Efficient trade ("a mere 0.1% reduction in transaction costs quadruples a country's wealth")
3. Division of labor and specialization (productivity)
4. Network size
Crypto finance addresses all of these points. Offers agorithmic security. Reduces need for human involvement and compliance. Results in cheaper and faster transations.
Cryptofinance ecosystem: Blockchain technologies and Off-blockchain techologies (eg Monetas). Off-chain transactions can come down to milliseconds. Off-chain costs 1/10,000th of a cent, 1M times cheaper than bitcoin. You can store assets securely on-chain, trade assets efficiently off-chain. 
The worlds first global distribution platform: the mobile phone. The random genius kid born poor in Africa can now securely trade globally.
We will see radical transformation of:
- Financial systems
- Communications systems
- Production systems
- Governments and Legal systems
"Explosion of wealth creation."
"Revolutions that throw out the old [ideas and institutions] are almost always a bad idea, they usually take us back. The sensible way is evolution and transformation. Banks are going to be here [in the future], governments going to be here, but what we can do is to transform how they operate." So all standards will increase for many institutions.

Maybe you can display the value of bitcoin at the time of every event?

I'd like to add that the blockchain can be used as a notary. For example if you want to save a documents exact version "forever in time" (such as the terms of an agreement) just send the hash of the file to the blockchain.

Depends on how you use bitcoin. Here is my opinion:
If you want to casually use bitcoin every now and then, and still keep the pretty safe use **multibit**.
If you want to keep them very very safe but still have relatively easy access when needed, use **Armory**.
If you want to use as a "checking account" and be able to use even when you're away from your computer, use the android app **Bitcoin** Wallet.
But of course don't take anyones word for it, do your own research. After all, you are responsible for your bitcoins.

"When I email you a picture, I still have that picture. So how can we have an only-digital currency where I can send it to you, *and I don't have it anymore*? Bitcoin. Oh by the way, the protocol defined it's own unit of account, also called bitcoin."

I often hear "Bitcoin will be either worth a lot, or it will be worth nothing." I agree with this if we don't care about the time involved. If bitcoin becomes the global currency then I think that there will be a significant redistribution of wealth, but more importantly there will be redistribution of *power*. To me this is more exciting (I realize wealth and power are closely correlated).
I think similar examples of technology based paradigm shifts are relevant. Internet took a lot of wealth and power away from the media and entertainment sectors' executives and redistributed it to the general public (online news, books, movies, music). However the giants in the sectors adapted in different paces, some failing to adapt quick enough. 
I think the same will be seen in many other sectors due to the impact of bitcoin. Every reaction from the global market players will be based on some inherent speculation on the future of bitcoin, and those who correctly adapt will have a higher chance of succeeding. I also think that those who benefit from the status-quo will fight the adoption. A quote from Morpheus is appropriate (because it's cool):

You can use bitminter, but I'm pretty sure they have a ~0.01 BTC withdrawal limit. With one of those, you'll probably make around 0.0003 BTC a day with the currency difficulty. So maybe in a few months you can get some bitcoin out of it.

I don't know how much I should be voicing this, but I strongly believe we should switch to quoting price in satoshis.

I explained that he actually could spend whatever amount he wants, but I was also amazed that even though he knew a lot about how the protocol worked, he didn't know he didn't have to buy "a (whole) bitcoin."

The returns of mining is very heavily (entirely) dependent on mining difficulty since the higher the difficulty, the more people are mining (more hasrate), the less you get from the pie. So it's very hard to predict returns on mining without knowing the future. Especially since it seems like there are new hardware companies starting up planning to have significant improvements on hardware and mining. If you don't have much bitcoin and want to get some "to not miss the train," you can go on localbitcoins.com (in the US only I believe) and buy bitcoins today using cash.

If you talk to a lot of people about bitcoin you eventually realize there are numerous types of target audiences each focusing on different things about bitcoin. I know, for example, engineers around me immediately start asking technical questions about the system. On the other hand, older people sometimes take the security and technical aspect as a given, and wonder what *other people* think about bitcoin. Bitcoin is a combination of several very important "features" and limited supply (hence increasing value) is one of them. Some people finally get sold hearing about price increase because perhaps they see it as an increase in public trust. If you are not comfortable making bitcoin seem like a get-rich-quick scheme there is no reason for you to talk about it that way (since it is taking away the focus from the actual benefits of the system), but realistically that part is exactly what appeals to some.

I use multibit. Highly recommend. You will simply transfer the bitcoins from your localbitcoins wallet to the multibit one (or more than one, using multibit you can have as many wallets as you like, one can be a long-term savings and another daily usage, for example). All you need is the wallet address, which is easy to find. Before you transfer all of what you have I suggest starting with a small amount to make sure everything's working.

Don't worry about losing your bitcoin as long as you have that 4 line backup. The biggest problem that you may have is that you might not be able to spend the bitcoin as soon as you would prefer, but there's practically no way you're going to lose your bitcoins if you have a backup. From what I know so far I would advise you to restart your computer and try to get it to sync again. If you don't want to spend your bitcoins though, they are safe in your Armory wallet and no need to worry.

If you read what people who think it's a scam say, almost all of them don't understand at least one crucial part of bitcoin. For example:

"There are members of the congress who still don't know what the internet is all about so they certainly don't know what bitcoin is."
Hahaha, very true.

You can calculate the cost to mine ~2 BTC *now* but no one can know what mining difficulty will be in the future, so what you're asking is impossible to answer completely without knowing the future.
[This]( is kind of relevant, kind of.

The author does not demonstrate any understanding of the Bitcoin protocol/encryption/network in this article. I think the main point of the article was:


*Every* currency is "conjured up" by some method and (depending on the view-point) is only worth something because a group of people agree it is worth something. To give perhaps an extreme example: in a cosmic scale even gold is very abundant and is worthless. Assuming people who use Bitcoin continue to agree it is worth something, and assuming Bitcoin will continue to be secure, I don't see any important justification for the conclusion in this article. "Law enforcement," as described in the article, is not a global entity. Some "law enforcements" may go after Bitcoin, but some will embrace it.

After comprehensive research I have concluded that the value of bitcoin will be $1,242.
