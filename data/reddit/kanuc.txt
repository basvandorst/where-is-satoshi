I use Cavirtex and am very happy with them. I chose them because they are a licensed business in Calgary Alberta. Setting up an account and becoming a verified user was very easy and quick. If I remember right it only took 1 day to become verified and depositing funds is usally done by the next moring.

Ignoring his r/conspiracy tendencies I still have to ask how is having a nice car and house being kept down by the man? 
His assumption that bitcoin is a tool of the global financial elite are two points on a map connected by nothing except his own raving lunacy

I dislike the slant forward and think it is a bad move, we do not need to be projecting the image of forward thinking in our symbol, everything about bitcoin is forward, our symbol needs to be a step back with a level head that projects trustworthiness and sturdiness. I'm not trying to be contrary here but The old symbol does this quite well already. 
Overall other messages bitcoin's symbol needs to quickly and succinctly say "Take me seriously!" Our current symbol does this well if only because it plays on the subconscious meaning of the vertical bars on a letter and that shouldn't be taken for granted.

You've answered your own question, PayPal could and should provide security to buyers and sellers using bitcoin.
As far as a product I meant it in the fashion that they could sell bitcoin directly at a small markup

Bitcoin is not ready for the major leagues, we would need a market cap of at least 500 billion to 1 trillion to be taken seriously there. Still it may happen sooner than we think
Edit: I think it's worth remembering that there are still simple individuals who could buy every single bitcoin without as much as batting an eye, let alone the mega corps out there.

I would think so as well, this targets the angel investors we are all hoping will board the bitcoin train

Again it depends on how big bitcoin becomes, if it is indeed the next global currency, then who is in a better position than PayPal to bring bitcoin to millions instantly? Bitcoin could instead of being a competitive product become there best product yet. I say if they stand against bitcoin they are a dinosaur and if they stand with bitcoin they may well be the biggest company to have ever existed.

I wouldn't say there incompatible, just different. Yes bitcoin could displace the big players and that may well happen however I would place my bet not on PayPal failing but Paypal innovating to adapt to a changing market. PayPal with us is much much better than PayPal dead, there are many talented and gifted individuals within PayPal that could add to a real respectable backbone of support to bitcoin.

Yes that makes much more sence, from my previous understanding I would have thought the amount of bitcoin days destroyed would be equal to the number of bitcoins on that day but now I see that that could only happen if every bitcoin was moved once per day.

The answer to this question depends on what bitcoin will ultimately end up being, if we're holding onto the future global currency we are still in the infant stages of innovators, however if bitcoin remains the plaything of weeaboo neck beards, well... This is all were getting.
I think in the last few weeks its safe to say bitcoin will probably reach at least the level of alternate Internet currency but hopefully in a few years it'll be the dominant currancy. We need to get PayPal onboard for that to happen tho
