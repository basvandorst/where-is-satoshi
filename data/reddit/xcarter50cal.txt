Part of the reason I was buying 0.001 was because it was/is the minimum the Cash app allows for withdrawal. If bitcoin performs how I expect it will, the cash app will eventually need to lower the withdrawal minimum to 0.0001 btc. I expand on my strategy in another answer in this thread but I set aside about $20/day to buy bitcoin so ill just be able to buy less Bitcoin then with the same amount of cash (hopefully).

Probably just my personality style. I've been micromanaging my crypto since 2017 because I wanted to take full advantage of the market cycle since i knew we would recover like we are now.
I set aside $20 per day (the most I could afford) a long time ago to buy bitcoin everyday while it was crashing in early 2018. I broke that up into 0.001 purchases. 
For example, when price was $8,000 in early 2018 I would buy maybe 0.0025 BTC ish daily (maybe $9.67 in the morning and $10.11 at night) - cent values are random so I could differentiate transactions to know when I reach my 5 maximum daily purchases on the cash app.
When Bitcoin was $3,200 I think I bought 0.001 at a time in about 4 or 5 daily transactions because even I was scared at the bottom of the bear market but kept my routine. It would have been about 0.006 BTC daily.
My point is I set up a system that kept me from making emotional decisions. It just became a way of life tbh and I drastically cut back my spending elsewhere. And I did it daily instead of weekly because I'm impatient.
Now I only buy 0.001 ish daily because my average buy is below $4k and anything above $10k is expensive to me. Like today I'll send $13.48 to the cash app, buy that amount worth of BTC, send it to a newly generated BTC address on my ledger and do it again tomorrow, except maybe it'll be $17.91 or $14.22.
*Edit: Keep in mind, each day for a year I was spending like $15-20 on an asset that was losing value. I lost money for A YEAR with no recovery in sight. In hindsight it is now massively profitable but it got very hard to lose money for a YEAR. Anyone else who DCA'd through a brutal bear market deserves these gains.

What I've done for the past couple years is buy a minimum of 0.001 everyday. No days off. Some days it's 0.002 or 0.003, but I have a daily ritual of buying 0.001 daily. It takes emotions out of the picture.
When Bitcoin was $3200 I was buying more aggressively. Now that it's above $10k it's getting more expensive (I still put in about $11 daily). I will not promise this will work in the future but it has worked for me.
As far as logistics, I buy bitcoin using the Cash App and send it immediately to my Ledger Nano S, on a newly generated BTC address every time.

I had a bot on Binance rebalancing hourly (25 coins at 4% each) from September until last week. 
The strategy was designed to profit from volatility. I had ups and downs and it was profitable in terms of dollars. But when bitcoin started pulling away from alts, I decided to sell all my alts for bitcoin.
At the end of April's alt season I was nearly +20% satoshis. Then I started losing satoshis. When I escaped into all BTC the final accounting was like +3% satoshis.
Basically, I gained about 3% in bitcoin at the end of my approximately 6-month experiment. Idk how else to trade systematically aside from chance and volatility across many coins. 
So now I just buy and accumulate bitcoin because I find trading is too stressful (like, checking in each hour to see what trades were made) and alt seasons will be less fruitful because everyone uses stablecoins to trade these days anyway.
Edit: also, high frequency trading requires you to keep funds on exchange. I'm so lucky I pulled all my BTC out of binance 6 days ago. Would advise against exchange hacking risks as well as altcoins in general.
