There's a link to the original source in this article. No one is lying and hiding the origin of the article.

Yes, come to Europe!

The kids are amazing. They already mined their first Bitcoin.

It might be old, but I had never seen it before. LOL!

Have you seen this possible solution? The guy who identified the problem published this on Bitcointalk.org:
"I recovered from this mistake.  This should work on both jailbroken and unmodified iPhones, and will not loose your jailbreak if done correctly (point 5):
1) Swear at Google (OK, most of you have probably already done that)
2) Delete the Google Authenticator app from your Phone.
3) If iTunes sync automatically with your phone, you probably want to turn that off first.  Also, if you sync over WiFi it may already be too late - I really do not know.
4) Connect your phone to iTunes.  Enable the panel on the left.  It shows "LIBRARY", "STORE", "SHARED" etc and also the name of the phone.  On newer iTunes it is disabled by default, choose View / Show Sidebar.
5) Right-click on your iPhone, choose "Restore from Backup".  DO NOT use the normal restore button on the main window, as that will also restore the firmware and wipe and restore everythin (it will take ages resyncing, and any jailbreak will be gone).
6) After restoring, iTunes will resync your phone and reinstall Google Authenticator.  If you did not sync or backup since upgrading the app, the old version INCLUDING KEYS will be back.
7) If jailbroken, install Update Hider and hide the update to GA (I have not done this yet myself, but it should work)."

It's fixed, thanks for your help!

Nope, no particular order.

Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the service is still being tested. They experienced some kind of technical problems a few hours ago also. You can contact Mike, who's the guy behind B1txr through Reddit - 
Hope it helps!
