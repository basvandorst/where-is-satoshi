Thanks for your measured response. For someone like myself who is swayed one way and the other on this issue by competing arguments, I think it boils down to this: Bitcoin Unlimited want faster transaction times **and** for BTC to be used easily for normal everyday transactions. If the bitcoin fork happens the Unlimited version would appear to be aspiring to become 'Bitcoin Lite' ... and BTC as a 'store of value' would presumably not be such a desired property since 'store of value' would put a brake on easy spend. People would hesitate in spending a 'store of value'.
With Bitcoin Core, it would seem that there is a compromise which is disputed, just as the Unlimited proposal is. Instead of an out-and-out focus on transaction times there are interim solutions proposed, but with a focus on playing for time. This would perhaps tend to support the notion of Bitcoin more as a store of value, than efforts to make BTC an everyday currency to use on everyday types of purchases.
I realise that I might be being overly simplistic here, but it could be that the Unlimited side could become **Bitcoin Lite**, while the Core side would be more conducive to retaining the property of a 'store of value' i.e. **Bitcoin Classic**.
In my view the debate should be opened up outside the technical sphere where sometimes scientists can have a blinkered view and, when told of possible conflicts, say something on the lines of "Sorry, not my field". That is why I think this debate should be out in the open as much as possible so that valuable experience from other areas can be drawn upon. Drawn upon not only on what is viable, but on where it could possibly lead. The more heads on this the better.
Maybe where the various proposals could lead to should be a separate topic.

Up till about a week ago, I wasn't much aware of the of the pros and cons of both sides to the Unlimited vs Core debate. I was on the SegWit side until I saw the recently broadcast debates between Roger Ver and Core adherents/devs. I was impressed by both sides of the argument, but one of the things that tipped me more over to the Roger Ver Side was the alleged censorship of Unlimited in r/bitcoin ... which I found to be true to some extent.
We need to have the opposing sides arguments aired and tested by constructive criticism. Censorship simply because certain proposals are disliked only creates suspicion. I'm still not fully convinced by either side - both put forward convincing arguments. Yes, let's continue the open discussions here and let the competing proposals do battle until consensus is hopefully reached.
@_date: 2017-03-01 07:45:44
The comment was made and accepted as fact apparently by all in the studio. Nobody disputed it and I didn't see any raised eyebrows or eyelids flicker. As to the identities of the Core devs - that was the concern of the person I responded to. I gave the same answer to him, that you gave to me.

I don't think Bitcoin ETF status was that important. You don't need a broker to buy Bitcoin, or any other coin for that matter. Crypto Evangelists reaching the people is all that is needed. Besides, as Simon Dixon has pointed out, "Bitcoin already has an ETF in Gibraltar. There is life outside of America."

My impression that debate is being stifled came from last part of the discussion in the YouTube video I have provided a link to in my main post. that section was devoted to censorship, particularly by As regards SegWit, Lightening, Tumblebit, Mimblewimble, MAST, Shnorr signatures, etc., I have considered them to be positive developments.
@_date: 2017-03-01 05:23:11
I keep an open mind. I found some aspects of the debate disturbing. In the YouTube videos both sides fully aired their views. Perhaps the aftermath of the clashing of arguments could lead to a greater understanding between the two parties and maybe we could get some progress towards common ground. Roger Ver's main point in the second debate was the question mark of how quickly SegWit could be implemented. He said it would take years. I did get the impression that he had mellowed a little though ... so who knows where this will lead?
@_date: 2017-03-01 05:27:58
Good point!
@_date: 2017-03-01 07:53:12
The evidence is plain to see on the YouTube broadcast. Whether it is true or not is another matter. An undisputed comment of that nature would tend to back up the veracity of that statement. If it wasn't true, I don't hear any of the devs denying it.
@_date: 2017-03-01 05:00:28
My account is newish, but not new. I find it amazing that asking a question could be considered an attack. I believe my question is valid. Roger Ver, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin.info et al are a very important part of Bitcoin. Why is there such censorship and resistance to the arguments that Roger Ver is putting? If those arguments are not valid people will see through them soon enough. The fact that he is being censored so vindictively would imply that he has a point; a point some are finding it difficult to answer. Why?
@_date: 2017-03-01 04:49:59
Roger Ver did say that the way the Bitcoin Core team were doing things that would lead to higher fees. If that is the case then that could lead to centralisation in that only large corporations could afford to transact with Bitcoin. I've heard elsewhere that the huge computational power needed to mine Bitcoin will soon be the preserve of large powerful corporations.Tone Vays disagreed that Bitcoin Core involvement would lead to higher fees. So who is right?
@_date: 2017-03-01 08:04:20
It was clear that Roger was talking about Bitcoin Core devs. The obvious response was for Tone Vays, or the Core dev in the debate the following day to ask who?, if they didn't already know. You all think, as I do, that that was a serious allegation to make. Yet none of the devs have bothered to comment on it, or even asked:"who?" It just seems to have been an accepted fact. Are none of you concerned about that, or would you prefer to cover it up?
@_date: 2017-03-01 04:34:27
I don't dispute that. The Blockstream guy that spoke in the second debate made a great impression on me and struck me as being very competent. I think Roger Ver had the same impression. The main problem is censorship and pulling the two sides together. Strong well-thought out arguments generally win in the end.
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:49:31
Sorry Roger from me too. I've got to admit I'm swinging more towards Core.
@_date: 2017-03-01 07:49:59
Well, if I was one of those devs and somebody said I was being funded by the banks, and broadcast it worldwide, I'd certainly call them a liar if it wasn't true.
@_date: 2017-03-01 07:18:04
And that is what the Core devs should do if that is the case. The fact that they haven't, so far as I am aware, would tend to confirm that Roger Ver was correct in the statement that he made.
@_date: 2017-03-01 07:34:24
The post did disappear and reappeared a short while later. That might have been a glitch, but it happened nevertheless. Regarding concern: unwarranted censorship has been a concern of mine here and in the thread of another coin I have contributed to in my short time as a Redditor. At least I am consistent in the views I hold.

I hope that you are not right, but experience tells me that you could be. It's cards on the table time.
@_date: 2017-03-01 04:41:58
That banks were involved in the development of Bitcoin was mentioned in the debate and not disputed at the time. If that allegation is false it should be refuted in the strongest possible terms by the Bitcoin Core developers themselves. Let's get to the bottom of this!
@_date: 2017-03-01 07:09:36
The question then becomes are Bitcoin Core ready to go ahead with implementation of SegWit without Bitcoin Unlimited? According to the evidence from both sides, that would lead to a split. Bitcoin and Bitcoin Classic. Do you think that Bitcoin Core would really cause that to happen?
@_date: 2017-03-01 04:21:08
You are probably right. Roger Ver in the YouTube debate did say that any criticism of SegWit etc. met with instant censorship here. I am probably wasting my time and that may be considered to be stupid. However, the rabid criticism I am encountering here only justifies what Roger alleges. I wouldn't have thought this of Reddit, but I am learning. My post seems to have been shut down almost the instant it was made. Shame on you Reddit moderators if that was your doing!
@_date: 2017-03-01 04:12:56
I am simply asking a question. If you think there is no substance to what Roger Ver claims, why don't you refute his argument? The fact that you haven't implies that you can't. I came to this after seeing the Roger Ver vs Tone Vays YouTube video. Why don't you watch it and make a valid refutation if you have one. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:19:42


For me this is the key sentence. Considering your circumstances and what you did with the profit you made by selling half your stake, I think you did the right thing. You still have a substantial stake riding on Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-03-01 04:31:34
I'm not disputing any of that. I am simply asking a question. In a subsequent YouTube debate again with Roger Ver I was impressed by a very articulate developer from Bitcoin Core who put forward some very strong arguments for SegWit. I am concerned as to the reasons for alleged unwarranted censorship. The fact that banks are involved in the development of Bitcoin also seems strange to me for reasons already stated. Let's get this out in the open and thrash out the differences between the two sides. Stifling debate with censorship only leads to suspicion and a delayed resolution to a very important matter.

Ask Tone Vays and Roger Ver who both seemed to be in the know on that score.
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:56:38
Inane, unsupported accusations combined with personal attacks typify the worst elements of both sides to the debate. Let's have a reasoned critique, backed up with good, solid authority. Andreas is a top Bitcoin guy and as such deserves to be listened to; not drowned out by a babble of mindless non-entities. Personal attacks are a sign of weakness on a personal level and are indicative of a potentially lost argument.
@_date: 2017-03-01 06:49:10
The comment was made by Roger Ver and wasn't disputed by Tone Vays who might be considered to be in a position to know. It might turn out that no Bitcoin Core developers have received funding from banks. You use the word 'Guilty' which would suggest that if Bitcoin Core developers were receiving funding from the banks you would see it as a serious offence. Yet you try to smother the question when it seemed to be accepted as fact by Tone Vays. I should imagine that Tone Vays would be in a better position than you to make a judgement. Why would Roger Ver make that comment if he didn't believe it to be true? If found to be false in the full glare of a world wide audience, then that would weaken his argument. Let the Core devs come forward and say that it isn't true. I certainly haven't heard any outcry from those devs even though I am sure at least some have seen the YouTube debate. There was one there on the second broadcast YouTube debate with Roger Ver. I didn't hear him pulling Roger up about the comment he had made about Core devs receiving funding from banks.
@_date: 2017-03-01 05:26:30
I think that is a question best put to the Bitcoin Core developers if in fact they are receiving funding from the banks.
@_date: 2017-03-01 03:58:50
That software engineers need a paychecks is not shocking news at all. The source of those possible paychecks could be in that banks are generally perceived to be threatened by Bitcoin i.e. it prompts the question whether there are strings attached to those paychecks. The climate of censure on over this and similar matters only adds to the aura of suspicion. I am simply opening up a debate on what some see as a very important issue: censorship of possible very valid criticism ... and whether there are sinister overtones.

Look, let's get this straight. SegWit2X is a smokescreen. The real reason why they don't add replay protection is because they want to try to wipe out the BTC SegWit chain. If they achieve that with the help of Jihan Wu and Roger Ver, I'm sure that SegWitX2 will be abandoned and that there will be a migration of the dark forces to the mediocre BCH (I'm saying that while holding a reasonable amount).
SegWit in any form is a real threat to that disingenuous company Shapeshift and to other companies like it, ... including the manufacturer of Bitmain Antbleed ASICS, because of SegWit, Lightning and atomic cross-chain transactions make them obsolete.
I wouldn't like to be in Roger Ver's or Jihan Wu's shoes for conspiring to undermine Bitcoin and messing with people's investment. Those people range from the completely honest to the criminal; from the individual citizen to some of the most powerful people in the world.
I believe that Bitcoin will come through this and be all the stronger for it.

... and to take this advice further, in general, unless you know what you are doing, never use Private Keys. Always use your seed words to restore a wallet. Addresses begin with the number '1' and, in Mycelium, you can see this in your account next to the QR code on the Balance page and the Receive page.
**Private Keys start with the number '5' followed by a capital 'L', or 'K' ('9' and a lower case 'c' on a testnet).** But again, the general advice is to stay clear of importing, exporting, f-ing around with Private Keys.

Lots of good advice here. I would only add to stay clear of wallets running on Microsoft Windows. Too many pieces of malware out there are designed to root out and raid Windows wallets.
If, for whatever reason, you can't get a hard wallet, I would recommend a wallet on a smartphone - far less chance of your coins being stolen than having a wallet on a desktop, if you take the right precautions - password protection in case your phone is lost or stolen.
I've used Mycelium on Android and found it to work well. It was compatible with the Electron version of Electrum when claiming 'that other coin-split giveaway' whose name can't be mentioned' because of moderation. My family members have Mycelium wallets on i-phones and are quite happy with them. Make sure that your key words are safe and that the wallet is password protected if considering this option!

BTC and LTC can 'merge' together to provide an effective solutions to scalability, faster transaction times, and cheaper transaction fees by utilising OMNI and Lightning. It's a marriage made in Heaven.
@_date: 2017-04-26 17:37:04
If Bitcoin can implement Lightning Networks it will give the Bitcoin blockchain the ability to 'merge' with the Litecoin blockchain to provide fast transactions **and** solve the scalability issue.
Bitcoin doesn't need to implement SegWit to get Lightning Networks, although it is far better if it does. Without SegWit LN would require some very complex coding.
This is a massive opportunity for Bitcoin to move forward. Charlie Lee: "Adding LN to BTC and LTC is like upgrading the blue portal gun to blue/orange. **BTC is now astronomically more valuable"**

Bitcoin + Litecoin + SegWit + Lightning + OMNI = the capacity for Bitcoin and Litecoin to merge blockchains for mutual benefit. It's potentially a symbiotic relationship.
@_date: 2017-04-15 13:45:04
Let's not get too hooked up on the blame game just for now. When the Period 6 signalling first started, the percentage of SegWit blocks signalling was 80% plus and  actually hit 100% for a brief period. I was watching at the start and took a screen shot. Granted, the percentage dropped to 76-78% hours later ... where it is now.
I would agree with jtoomin. We should have concrete evidence before fingers are pointed and people named. How do we know that it is not miners who would like to see UASF deployed on Bitcoin to break the impasse - DDos attacks from other coins etc? Breaking SegWit on Litecoin could force it to become the testing ground for UASF on Bitcoin. The drop could also be due to some miners realigning their equipment. So let's not jump to conclusions too soon.
Jihan Wu has been quite positive regarding SegWit on Litecoin - at least on the surface. No matter what can be said of him, I believe he is a proud man, and a man of his word.
@_date: 2017-04-26 18:02:47
Lightning Networks would enable the two blockchains to connect and share specific information when required. This would not only speed up transaction times, but would also provide Bitcoin with the scalabilty it so badly needs. You can read more about it here:

For those thinking about installing a full wallet node and how long it takes, it took me just over 6 days to get it fully synced from start to synced. That was about a week ago. That's not too bad. I've downloaded other blockchains in the past that have also taken days e.g. HoboNickels! (used to be one of my favourite coins ;-).
The PC I downloaded it onto was an i5, 64-bit running Windows 7, 4Gb RAM and a 500Gb C: hard drive, which I bought several years ago. Tip for those new to downloading blockchains: it gets slower towards the end so be a bit patient and just leave it running.
I'm also going to do the same with a spare Lenovo Thinkpad laptop  (I have 3), again i5, 8Gb RAM, 350+Gb HDD. I wouldn't try it with much less than 350Gb. The current size of the Bitcoin blockchain is 138.5Gb.
I'd love to explore doing this on a Raspberry pi 3 Model B Quad Core as some have done/advised (Roger Ver, I believe).

If you are going to insist on sticking to my shoe, at least respond by backing up opinion and prejudice with fact instead of spouting propaganda. This thread is sinking down the pages and is unlikely now to be read to any great extent. I will give you the coutesy of a quick response to the piffle you mindlessly trot out. In order of quotation:
1) Ask Craig Wright. His push towards blocks in the magnitude of Gigabytes are in his twitter feeds and videoed conferences on YouTube;
2) SegWit and LN are not tampering with BTC - they are part of it. Haven't you heard the news? Mb increases in the lower orders have not shown to be necessary, and wouldn't be that effective on their own if BTC was adopted on a global scale;
3) BTC as it stands now is potentially capable of both. SW, LN Atomic swaps etc. Whether anyone buys your bridge, should it be necessary, would depend upon how competive you are in the market. That's capitalism you know!
4) I didn't cherry pick a transaction, it was one I actually did, or is your reading impaired by your obsessional need to defend a threatened position? If you doubt that, I'm quite willing to provide signed verification in return for a decent wager ... or you might actually try a BTC transaction yourself using a wallet to control the amount of fee paid;
5) BTC could function as both. A store of value and P2P currency - the latter, if you were, for example, the citizen of a third world country and were prepared jump through the hoops and put in place the necessary structure to transact;
6) Core, from what I gather as a whole, Luke Jr aside, are not adverse to increasing the block size. They would rather exercise caution, especially after BTC taking SegWit on board. One jump at a time and review. That's common practice when making big changes in the scientific and business world. From the sound of it, your obsessional drive in wanting to punch 2X through is a recipe for disaster and you know it. I believe that's your little game.
Finally, and I hope it is finally, since I doubt whether anyone is listening to this thread, as it diappears down the rankings, your hackneyed diatribe reveals your actual purpose which is to obfuscate. The reality is that no one knows with any great certainty where the Bitcoin experiment will lead, at this moment in time ... not even you, otherwise you wouldn't be stooping to desperate, bottom-of-the-barrel, idea scraping to defend your fragile position. BTC as it is now with SegWit is obviously a big threat to you, so you want to undermine it. Get lost!

Bigger BTC block sizes are not a reality either at this moment in time. My main point in posting here is to help the No2X movement postpone the rush to bigger block sizes. It seems prudent to me to give SegWit and the associated tech some space to prove itself. Bigger blocks can come later if there is a consensus that they are necessary. The list published here identifies some companies who might be persuaded to voice their support of a postponement of 2X.

People do mention Adam Back as having a hand in the creation of Bitcoin. Charlie Lee was the latest that I can recall ... a week, or so ago in one of his tweets he acknowledged, half-seriously, or not, that Adam Back is Satoshi. Adam Back certainly does have the credentials and that important thing: integrity - integrity in the Hal Finney mode. Nick Szabo will also be there when the history is written.
I am fascinated by the Hal Finney, Wei Dai and Satoshi (Dorian) Nakamoto possible collaboration/intrigue! Hal Finney, at the very least, had a hand in the early Bitcoin code. I understand that he also worked on some of Adam Back's coding that formed an integral part of Bitcoin. So, I agree - Adam Back definitely does deserve a mention - if not more!  ;- )

 I slightly disagree. I believe it is the Users, Investors and those imbued with the cypherpunk ethos that should take a lead - not in the project so much, but in emphasising the direction in which they think Bitcoin should take.
The main developers are Core. Blockstream is part of Core. Blockstream's CEO is Adam Back (inventor of HashCash on which POW is based). He is one of the originals:  I believe the project is safe in his hands and all the other cypherpunks who comprise Blockstream and Core. Users should take a lead in supporting Core.
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:08:43
I think the situation could be described like this: if you are going to be a payment system like BCH intends to be, challenging VISA and the like, you need massively bigger blocks, and we are talking here in the magnitude of multiple Gigabytes at least, and the large bandwidth necessary to go with it. If you are intending to become a global retail payment processor, without SegWit, LN etc., Mb sized blockchain increases are piddling.
With Bitcoin (BTC) we now have SegWit and all the possibilities that holds. Bitcoin has found a niche as a store of value AND ... (a very important and) - **it already has a 2Mb blocksize.** As Luke-Jr has emphasized, the NYA deal was for 2Mb, not 2X (2X = 8Mb).
In an ideal world both should run side-by-side peacefully. However, while in theory multiple-Gb blocks and vast server farms with huge bandwidth might work, I think the BCH project is doomed for the following reasons: VISA, the Central Banks et al are not going to stand by and let this happen - they could duplicate the project themselves (most, if not all is open source); the leaders of the BCH project are easily targetted and one has already spoken of selling his soul to the Devil; the vast set-up and equipment necessary could become obsolete overnight by new advances in technology and fade into oblivion like the dinosaur.
So to sum up: There's nothing wrong with a SegWit 2Mb blocksize. We already have it. SegWit with LN (instant txs), MAST, Atomic Swaps, Shnorr Sigs, Confidential Transactions could scale cautiously to larger Mb block sizes if necessary and become retail payment friendly in the not too distant future.
Without SegWit, huge blocksize and bandwidth increases are needed, along with vast server farms processing blocks almost instantly - not really good news for small mining pools and individual S9 owners who won't get a smell in because they won't have enough bandwidth to compete. As soon as they latch onto a block it will snatched off them by the dedicated server farms before they can process it.

You present me with a conjecture as if it were fact and ask me whether it's OK. Well, quite some time ago in r/bitcoin, I did actually question Blockstream funding and possible motives. I quickly came to the conclusion that Blockstream are a group of well-intentioned people with a reasonable point of view. Just my opinion based on watching and listening to YouTube BTC block debates. That opinion was strengthened when I realised that Blockstream are in fact a group of committed cypherpunks under the leadership of possibly the arch-cypherpunk of all time - Adam Back. On face value that is instant street cred.
Blockstream are only one part of Core. For me, Core is Bitcoin. They created it. My take on it is that they looked at the scalability problem and taking on the big financial institutions. SegWit was created as a solution which hopefully could open the door to solving scalablity ... solving it under the radar. Satoshi himself advised caution and not attracting the attention of those who could destroy the project before it took hold. I see the same situation developing now.
On the one side I see a group of idealists who created one of the greatest inventions of the century; on the other side I see bare-faced lying, deceipt and misrepresentation. Not just my opinion and some day the history of this matter will be written.
So to answer your question, I am as sure as sure can be that Core are well -intentioned and have the best interests of the Bitcoin project at heart. I don't accept the validity of your conjecture. You present no evidence. It's spurious. I am OK with the course Core has taken. I really must go now ... Monday morning and all that.

Clichéd rhetoric on your part, stemming from an entrenched position by the sound of it. BCH has bigger blocks already, which look like being increased to Gb proportions soon. CSW might be right. However, becoming a mere payment facility, challenging VISA and PayPal, would entail BCH losing some of its property as a store of value. BTC has found that 'store of value' niche by evolution. I don't think that we should tamper with it too much.
SegWit and LN open up vast possibilities of peer-to-peer transaction. You are obviously against that and I don't condemn you for it. SegWit is here though, solving malleability issues etc. I don't see any contradiction between evolutionary tech implementations going hand-in-hand with a cautious evolution of the basic blockchain if it becomes necessary. BCH would seem to be more suited to you. It is SegWit free. So, why don't you agree to let both experiments progress?
If you are implying that BTC transaction fees are high, you are living in the past. A few hours ago, in block  I sent 0.21463997 BTC @ 106 sats/byte for priority clearing. The current going rate is 5 sats/byte for regular clearance and 100 sats/byte for priority. My transaction came through almost immediately and confirmations started a few minutes later. Quite acceptable for my purposes. I don't intend trading a store of value for a cup of coffee any time soon. Lightning should improve transaction times tremendously. SegWit is here whether you like it, or not. So your bigger block observation is hypothetical, but not necessarily invalid.
Finally, isn't creating a 'need' a primary cornerstone in establishing value? Isn't identifying and solving a need every inventor's dream?

Ordinary miners need to be made aware that bigger blocks will mean that only large corporations will be able to afford the vast computing power necessary to process transactions. Ordinary miners will become redundant. This will make the corporate takeover complete. **2x and  BCH are ultimately banker's coins.**

 So, are you proposing a takeover? Bitcoin was designed to be leaderless based upon consensus. Most people, even those from the other side, have faith in Core's ability to code. Adam Back has an overview that most do not possess. There is no one better qualified than he in knowing the original intentions behind Bitcoin and how to bring them into fruition.
Core have exercised caution in making changes. They test and peer review modifications to the code thoroughly before implementation. SegWit, Lightning, MAST and all the tech now becoming available are about to open up vast possibilities and quantum leaps in what can be done. You and anyone reading this can help bring all this about by supporting Core with consensus.
We can also support Core by being aware who is not expressing support, and by encouraging the companies that do - and there are quite a few. The list provided by the original poster helps.

Who? Certainly not me, and I don't see any others. You are the one who is trying to purposely obscure the issue. By the way, this thread is about identifying companies that still seem to be supporting NYA 2X, whether intentionally, or not. That will give Users an informed choice in deciding which companies to do business with.

He may be. This Satoshi Nakamoto lived a short distance away from the late Hal Finney who died in 2014. Hal Finney received the first ever Bitcoin transaction from 'Satoshi Nakamoto'. Hal himself has also been tagged as a candidate for being 'Satoshi'. I understand that around the time Bitcoin and Bitcoin precursors were being thought of, the Satoshi Nakamoto pictured here was having pressure put on him by a bank to possess his home.
Like a lot of people, I'd like to believe that this is the real 'Satoshi' ... or Hal Finney, or Wei Dai (the creator of b-money before Bitcoin came along). Hal Finney and Wei Dai were in communication with each other at the time Bitcoin was being conceived.

It's more than just bandwidth IMO. If we take the Craig Wright, huge-blocksize, headlong rush into competing with VISA roadmap into consideration and whatever version of Bitcoin (call it bitcoinX) chose that path, then bitcoinX transactions would presumably be occuring on Amazon, eBay and other globally-sized corporations. Those companies, possibly even banks, would logically have their own mining centres to facilitate quick processing.
With all that competition, what hope does a miner, with his S9 infected with Antbleed have? He would be an ever-diminishing cog in an insignificant pool competing against ever-increasing global, corporate mining machines, all vying to grasp the next block.


I believe that there is more than one way to skin a ... (ahem) pigeon! Putting a hold on large block size increases for now, while we see what SegWit, Lightning and others can do is one such way.

Bigger blocks with lots of txs from the large multi-nationals should a big block system catch hold. Lots of competition from those large multi-nationals with their own mining centres to speed processing - all competing with other large mining farms with massive processing capability. What hope does an S9 have against them? See my answer above in the thread it originated from.

The article seems quite reasonable to me.
* 1) Implement SegWit with all the benefits it brings - malleability fix, increased block capability - Lightning Networks which could solve the scalability problem for good etc;
* 2) review, and cautiously evaluate after the SegWit dust settles; and
* 3) decide whether any major change is needed. To my mind it wouldn't be, but if it appeared necessary to 'physically' increase the block size, then that could be done at a later stage after SegWit has been implemented.
Being cautious isn't stalling. Being resistant to well-tried and tested solutions that would appear to be safe and effective is. I prefer the measured step-by-step approach rather than the throw everything at it, all-in-one-go approach. My hope is that others do too.

Read this quote from a recent Bitcoin ICO proposal from the ViaBTC mining pool:


ViaBTC is crying out for funding via an ICO for its Plan B. Could it be finding spamming/DDOS attacks too expensive to maintain - and that is the reason tx fees and times have fallen?
ViaBTC confirms in this document that it is aware of how to slow down transactions and create log jams. Funny it should publish it at this current time. Could ViaBTC be behind the spamming - at least in part?
