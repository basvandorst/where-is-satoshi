Exactly, thank you.

Yes, if the author's private key to his or her current address is stolen, then all of the funds can be channeled to the bad guy's address. The advantage of this system is that there is only one point of failure, the current private key. All of the other private keys are now irrelevant.

Yes, the hacker could do that. However, he couldn't do that with any of the other private keys. There is now only one point of failure.

You are right in that there is zero expected return. Also, I like the idea of just seeing if the address has had some coins at some point. That is a lot more practical than not allowing any 0 balance bitcoin addresses 
If someone has a security breach they might send their bitcoins to a new address first before signing the permanent forwarding transaction. With the 0 balance protocol this would not be possible since the balance is now 0.

The only problem I see with address farmers is they could potentially spam the bitcoin system with these permanent transactions. A possible solution is to ignore all permanent forwarding transactions that are for an address that contains 0 bitcoins.

Thanks for your time man have a beer @_date: 2015-05-12 01:34:02
Hey thanks that made it pretty easy to understand. I guess now all I am confused about is how a faster block time makes it more prone to stale blocks. Is there a function that describes the probability of a stale block?

Can you ELI5 what granularity, reorganization, and stale blocks are?
@_date: 2015-05-09 16:41:14
OK maybe I should change it to 1mb/30sec so that we are just comparing block times. Are there any disadvantages of super short block times?
