Bitcoin represents the world's largest trustless financial distribution system. It allows the transfer of wealth across international borders without a third party. It has the largest group of dedicated engineers in the cryptosphere (I don't have data to  support this, though counting commits on girhub might back it up). Last but not least, it has successfully served as a store of value and investment vehicle for the last 9 years.
People often say bitcoin has zero utility, when they just mean that they currently don't see the utility it has for them. For many, many people, bitcoin has a great amount of utility.

There is actual utility to the bitcoin system. As long as it has utility, it has value. Time will tell what that value is. Perhaps you are correct and the current price is too high, but if you are basing it on bitcoin's lack of utility, I question the foundation of your assumptions.   Looking at something like gold as a benchmark for value (wherein bitcoin matches in several equivalent features, lacks in some areas and surpasses in others), bitcoin is still undervalued.

Depends on purchase size. Coinbase seems to offer a better spread but higher fees. 
I tested out Cash app last night with a $50 BTC purchase. I paid $.75 USD more than if I’d market bought with gdax, but Coinbase would have been about $1.50 more expensive. 
I don’t have the exact numbers, but ballparks:
Gdax $50 = .00456 btc
Coinbase $50 = .0039btc
CashApp $50 = .00451 btc
Obviously, the way to go would be gdax, but I wanted to know what would be the better option if I wanted to make a quick purchase and didn’t have funds sitting in gdax already.

Why not just increase the price to a million? It would increase mining competition and drastically increase the need for efficient energy utilization.
@_date: 2019-07-06 08:59:08
The main reason there is a carbon footprint is that miners are able to subsidize their bitcoin mining with external environmental costs that aren’t being factored into their expenses. Dirty energy exists because companies selling it aren’t footing the bill for the external effects (carbon, environmental damage, pollution, loss of tourism due to said pollution, etc).
The best way to deal with bitcoin’s carbon footprint (which is still a glimmer of a fraction of traditional banking), is to move towards charging companies and countries for the actual effects of their energy utilization.

Wasn’t the person you originally replied to, just felt like responding because it’s always been funny to me that people separate millionaires and working Americans without considering that to most of the rest of the world, working Americans are part of the 1%.
There are opportunities for people who want to simplify their lives and abandon frivolities like running water, flush toilets, and the like. It makes complete sense to me that doing so may allow one to focus on essentials. But most people, given a choice, don’t want to be subsistence farmers, and would rather chase a lifestyle that offers upward mobility, even if it entails sacrifice.
Not saying the priorities make sense, just that it’s there. The working American could also become a subsistence farmer if they wanted to. There are communes that would take them. They would actually be given a choice of locales, and likely have the resources to relocate.

Bitcoin is non-reversible. The buyer loses an easier opportunity to recover funds in the case of a scam or misrepresentation.

Speaking as someone who makes his living through tips, I fully support tipping.
People often point to the argument that an employer should be paying the employee. Employees are required to supplement a tippee's wages if they don't make a minimum level. In any halfway decent establishment, this is completely unnecessary, and a tipped employee will make substantially more than they would make if the employer was paying them (If I moved to Europe my earnings would be cut in half). 
Tipping allows waitstaff, bartenders, casino dealers, etc to make a wage that supports their family, and rather than charging every customer the same rate it is weighted for those able and willing to spend more. I love tipping, and I love that I am in a job where I get to directly experience other's generosity.
I also don't see any oppressive about offering to give someone more money if they accept it in a different form of payment. It seems less "dance like a monkey and I'll give you $20" and more "I was going to give you this $20, would you rather take these $60 in rolled up nickels?"

\&gt; There are more years with 0 rise in Q4 than spikes.
For the previous seven years, I count 4 years where Bitcoin increased notably between Oct 1st and Jan 1st (2013, 2015, 2016, 2017), two minor drops (2011: $4.85-$4.58 &amp; 2014: $388-$322), and one negligible increase (2012: $12.61-$13.33).
We have seen a notable increase from October-December the last three years. and the last 4 out of 5.
I agree that past performance does not dictate future results, but there has been a identifiable trend, and many traders do look at these things and factor it into their assumptions.

This will happen because people find it more useful to think in terms of sats. If you are comfortable with that and it aids in communication, use it.

Definitely true for US trades made after Dec 31, 2017. Most likely untrue for trades made before then, thanks to the timing of the loophole being closed and wording of the tax bill. On the safe side (or because they didn’t know any better), some people have decided to report their crypto-to-crypto trades on this most recent tax filing. Many others elected to defer any crypto-to-crypto tax reporting until next year. 
I have yet to hear from a single person who has gotten in trouble for failing to claim crypto-to-crypto thus far (not to say it hasn’t happened, if anyone has an experience to the contrary, please speak up). 
FWIW, it appears the IRS had many opportunities to officially declare that crypto-to-crypto was taxable before 2018, and instead they opted to stay silent and close the loophole.

I'm going to go full Unpopular Opinion Puffin here.
Caveats: I have no love for BCash. I hold the small amount that was given during the fork, plus some minimal gains daytrading. I believe utterly in bitcoin's dominance.
When we crest out of this bear market correction, every alt with a modicum of a value proposition will likely gain at a higher rate than BTC.  Some might say that TA is meaningless, past behavior does not dictate future results, yadda yadda, but this has been the case nigh 100% of the time. Once the crypto market regains its spot as a solid buy, all the secondary projects, which include Bcash (despite our distate for Ver and centralization ) , will start to look more attractive. 
If you think that bitcoin is a solid long term investment, it is entirely rational to assume that the alts are at minimum a solid short-term investment. We aren't going to hit $1,000,000 USD/BTC parity overnight. It will take many more of these booms and busts. 
In the meantime, Bitcoin is king, and the market is rising and falling based on the capricious whims of the king's followers. But soon, a rising tide will lift all boats. And the king will be responsible, but the market will regain as a whole. I wouldn't bank on holding any alt particular alt five years from now, but arguing that even a stupid, money-grabbing alt isn't a good investment feels like saying that nothing that we've seen in the past is indicative of what's to come.

Not inevitably. In any generally-appreciating asset like Bitcoin, you can have a chain of successful trades for profit. Trader one buys bitcoin for $.01 and sells for $.02, trader three sells for $.05, trader four for $.25, etc.
You could say that each seller lost out by losing bitcoin, but you can't assign future value for a commodity based on a current sell price. As long as each trader exchanged for a great value adjusted for inflation than their purchase price, they are all successes.
There are lots of experiences of people selling at a loss, but that's not an inevitable part of the process unless you have backed the wrong commodity.

1. Buy BTC with fiat.  
2. Trade BTC for alt (taxable event, gain or loss depending on the difference between the fiat value you paid for BTC in Step 1 and the alt's current market value).  
3. Trade alt for BTC (taxable event, based on the difference between the market value of alt when received in Step 2 and BTC's current market value).  
4. Sell BTC for fiat (taxable event, based on difference between market value of BTC during Step 3 and fiat value received).

Alts have been waiting for bitcoin to show an extended uptick, which we still haven’t had. Looking at the last three months, this drop was longer than any particular day since perhaps June 21, but yeah, the market went up and then the market went down. There are lots of similar candles, it happens every time the market gets oversold, the higher the rise, the steeper the fall.

Suppose So-and-So Financial Service was likely to offer the ETF to armchair investors by requiring only a percentage buy-in and consolidating purchases.  What if the exchange themselves was already marketing the ETF in a format that they weren’t representing to the SEC (they have not done anything of the sort that I’m aware of, I’m just creating hypotheticals for why the SEC would want to ask these questions). 
The SEC is asking because it’s a cornerstone of the ETF’s case, and maybe someone knows something they don’t. Even if it was a cut-and-dry situation (and little in this sphere is cut-and-dry when dealing with crypto and big money investments), they are doing their due diligence by asking because they invariably don’t have all the information.

If the house has an edge, then no strategy can guaranteed a profit, and the longer you play, your chance of losing everything moves toward 100%.
If the game is beatable: a scam that prevents you from withdrawing money is more likely than a fair match.
If the game is fair, then a proper betting strategy could double your money a bit less than half the attempts, on average. But it's definitely advisable to see any of these games as entertainment, not a source of profit.

In OPs opposition: Failing to use stop-losses when dealing with margin is a serious, clearly advised no-no; pretty much the most consistent piece of advice given to every new investor looking to expand into forex and related markets.
People claim market manipulation when the prices rise, they also claim it when the prices fall.  Many actors with influence want to see bitcoin's price rise, many want to see it fall. Some of those actors talk to one another. However, there was nothing about December's rise that couldn't be explained by FOMO across large groups of traders, none of whom truly knew where the price was going to stop. Historically, December was unusual but hardly an anomaly, given bitcoin's traditional cycles of boom and bust.

As many others have mentioned, there is always risk if someone else is holding your coins. The risk increases significantly if you are located outside the US and using a US exchange (or if you are in the US and keeping your coins on a non-US based exchange).  You also run the risk anytime you want to move money off of an exchange due to money laundering laws ($10,000+ moved at once, or multiple smaller movements that look like they are trying to disguise $10,000+ in movement, or trading with someone on a no-trade list, etc. Only the government(s) involved and the exchanges know what exactly will trigger a financial hold or confiscation.
Despite all that, I still keep the majority of my coins on exchange because I use their trading services and it would be inconvenient to transfer only when I want to make a trade. However, I definitely understand I'm trading convenience for security.

They aren’t trolling. A significant hurdle to confirming a bitcoin ETF type product is the position that it could be harmful to your day-to-day investor who is at the mercy of market manipulators.
This proposal might pass largely because it is out of the reach of the average investor. The SEC isn’t asking if the average person can afford 25 bitcoin. They are asking if the public has any new perspectives or rebuttals to the position that it will be out of reach. Basically, they are crowdsourcing critique, in case there are factors that they simply aren’t considering.
This is an intellectually reasonable thing to do.

A single bitcoin is divisible up to 100 million units* (satoshis, satoshi, or sats). Losing bitcoin through accidents, lost seeds, intential burning, etc, is expected and will eventually create a deflationary system (we’re not there yet thanks to mining). But we have many, many, many units of coins to divide before such an issue was a problem. 
Also, there is always the possibility of forking bitcoin to allow smaller units than the satoshi. This would solve the divisible units problem without printing more money.

You would only have to pay a tax if there is a positive difference between the value when you received it and when you transferred it to local fiat. It can be mitigated by immediately transfering to fiat, but is generally a problem you would like to have, since it means your transfer is worth more than when you got it.
This isn't a flaw in crypto, just a relic of the current system and a factor of the deflationary nature of crypto.
EDIT: Of course you would also owe tax if you are receiving the crypto as payment for goods and services, but this is true for basically every single transaction regardless of currency.

1) This feels more to me like an unlocked front door. We can all reach a front door in a public city. That doesn't give us the right to open the door and take whatever we want inside.
2) This sounds like squatting, which has its own rich and complicated legal history. If someone has a property, and someone else lives there, there becomes a point when the squatter has rights to the property, depending on circumstance, time occupied, etc.
3) Value that enters into a property is due to the person it was intended. If I deliver a refrigerator to a property with a squatter, the refrigerator is due to the person who paid for it.
4) The money should go to whomever has the best claim.

Speaking as someone who is over-leveraged in the crypto sphere: 
The vast majority of advice given on this subreddit has been to enter into crypto only money you are able to lose, don’t invest until all debts are paid, have a savings account, and diversify your investments.
So, it’s true that perhaps OP followed that advice, had a serious run of bad luck, burned throuh their savings, extended their credit (or had none to draw from), and finally had to pull from crypto when it was worth less than invested....or they did what a lot of people have done, which is put money into crypto that they did eventually expect to get back sooner than later, not really expecting that the bear market would take this long to move through.
While either is possible: catastrophic, unplanned bad luck is rare (or it would have been covered in an average savings cushion), but unmitigated optimism (or moving towards risk without properly planned security) is commonplace.

No one knows by how much and when the halvening will be priced in. Some people claim that it already has. It's also possible that it'll still drop more first, and when the halvening comes we'll see an increase but it won't be enough to handle the additional drops. There are people that claim previous halvenings were priced in anywhere from a dozen months before to a dozen months after the actual events.
No one can 100% predict the market. Anyone who says differently is a fool or looking to sell something to fools. (I  believe that playing the market can be profitable, but that's using long term analysis, diversified portfolios, nerves of steel, etc.. There are no easy paths or automatic formulas).

This is the first point where we definitely disagree. There are reams and reams of texts debating the definition of evil, and its all too easy to paint one position as virtuous and the opposite as evil.  Would it be evil to tax Amazon to feed dying children? Would it be evil to not tax them? (Those are rhetorical questions. My point is simply that different people will answer those questions differently and can easily paint those who disagree as "evil").






No, as defined by statistics and history. There are clear systemic challenges in the world that are reinforced by poverty and a lack of quality education. Things can be improved. I'm not saying we need a big government, but I believe we should be using some of our pooled resources to work on improvements.






Interesting statistic, but not pertinent. I was referencing "safe streets" in regards to community violence. My position is that by addressing issues at an early level, through education and resources for the mentally ill and homeless, we will have safer streets and have to spend less money later on band-aid solutions like crime prevention and prisons. The money will be spent one way or another. I just want the solution that works better.








I give charity, as best as I am able given my resources.  And yes, I prefer to give directly because large organizations are often inefficient. Corruption is a problem, and I 100% agree with you on that point. I don't believe that means we shouldn't try, just that it's another factor that needs to be considered through oversight and government transparency. I don't want the government looking into our crypto, but I would *love* to be able to use crypto to keep track of our government.

It’s how the scam works. You wouldn’t think it passes the smell test, but the scammers play on emotions and don’t give the mark an opportunity to think about it rationally.  
A skilled scammer will whip someone up in a panicked frenzy, convince them they are going to face intense fines and possibly incarceration due to an unpaid government debt, and then dangle the chance of an immediate payment to mitigate the disaster. By that point, the mark is looking for any out, and their brain chemistry will quite literally not allow them to think logically because they are in full fight-or-flight survival mode.

It’s true. However, studies have shown that once you factor in fees, your odds of profitably day trading conventional stocks are functionally the same as random chance.  Day trading crypto was potentially profitable because of two factors: it was an emerging market with higher volatility than average, and one could trade cheaply enough that fees wouldn’t beat out the edge. 
FWIW, I no longer day trade anyway: I’m now a swing or positional trader, avoiding crypto-fiat markets in exchange for long term cycles of crypto-to-crypto. But Coinbase used to be my preferred spot, since regardless of timing, every pip helped. I’ll probably transition to RH, which annoys me because they don’t allow direct crypto-to-crypto trades, their liquidity doesn’t feel as high, and their product is only a pseudo-crypto derivative, which means I’ll still have to move to fiat and buy on another exchange for my long term holding (and in the meantime, I’m not even participating directly in the crypto ecosystem).

Depends on the market, but I'd say western markets: left, eastern markets: right. To a western viewer, the left coin is more likely to be seen as rolling forwards, and the right coin is rolling backwards (or holding back). Connotationally, that could represent restraint, but also regression, or lack of progress.
However, by extension of eastern hemisphere inhabitants more likely to read right-to-left, the left coin is more likely to connote regression, while the right coin is progressive (devil's advocate, it could also be seen as falling, while its opponent could be seen as "measured". This is just an armchair analysis, after all, we'll have harder data after the focus tests).

While this seems extremely counter-intuitive, I believe he is saying that when bitcoin has past 3800, it will likely shoot up from there. If it drops below 3800, it's likely that the price will drop further.  
The assumption isn't that stock traders should buy at 3801 and sell at 3799, but sell at 3799, look for deals as it oscilliates somewhere between 3000-3799, and when the price climbs over 3800, finish buying in and hodl on.

At this point, we are possibly \(hopefully\) just leaving a bear market.  I would be heavily weighted towards alts, with a plan to transfer back into bitcoin when their XXX/BTC value increases.
But maybe you think otherwise. In that, I suggest asking yourself the following: what do I think are the odds that bitcoin will increase in value in the near future?

If all traders were pulled from the system and the only users were people actually exchanging for goods and services, the fiat value of bitcoin would tank.

We don’t know coinbase’s politics, but we do know that it dots its eyes when it comes to government money laundering laws, which we also know includes regulations against working with certain organizations. We also can surmise given its market niche that gab was likely catering to some people and organizations that may have been on that list.
Whether any of that is a good idea, ethical, right, etc, is for a different debate. I was merely trying to point out that there is another plausible reason that coinbase might sever ties with gab, that has more to do with the “extremist” side of the equation and simple capitalism, not particularly because the platform was leaning right-wing.

I agree, but there's a difference between a measured stop loss and selling at the bottom. Although as long as the product/technology/investment is sound, I would argue that dollar cost averaging is a better strategy for most investors.

An 8x increase in the blockchain from the beginning would be objectively worse for decentralization. If the requirements today to run a node were 1.1TB+, many more people would be pushed out.
There’s zero way to prove that 8mb would cause problems down the line. Any projection will float or sink depending on how prescient Moore’s Law and related extrapolations end up being. But from a programming perspective, efficiency is a strong value, and octupling the block size increases the chances that we’ll hit more snags down the line.
There’s also the political realities of getting a block size increase without further fragmenting the protocol. (Personally, I think a one-time update that allows for a throttled size increase depending on the network’s needs is a more elegant solution and more likely to find consensus, but I don’t know anything about the technicals or problems such a solution might face).

Most rational people have not been arguing against blocksize increases \*ever\*. They are arguing against blocksize increases \*immediately\*. 
It's a band-aid solution that disincentivizes improvements that should be prioritized.  
It increases centralization, one of the cornerstones of bitcoin's philosophy (a node currently requires 145gb+ of hard drive space, which already pushes a lot of people out of being able to contribute to the ecosystem).   
Bitcoin is still in Beta and should be focusing on long -term efficiency, not bloat. 
A blocksize increase is pretty much inevitable. But it should be step Y, not step B.

This. 
Teachers have a lock on the "teacher's are underpaid" rhetoric, but the average US teacher salary is $60k/yr. That's not including benefits (approximately $20k more per year), a generous retirement, and plenty of vacation days. 
Yes, it varies greatly by school and state, but the bigger issues are that bad teachers are paid just the same as good ones (actually, bad teachers make even more, since they are less likely to put in extra effort or purchase additional teaching aids) and most schools themselves are underfunded (requiring the good teachers to pay for their own teaching aids in the first place), while also being entrenched in a system that reinforces systemic poverty by dividing up school budgets according to neighborhood wealth.
There are lots of improvements that could be made to the current education system (at least in America), but increasing teacher salaries is nowhere near top of the list.

Cheaper fees than credit cards is a moderate to major selling point, depending on the business.
If they can be convinced it’s good for their bottom line, you are halfway there. The other factors for them depends on how many people need to be trained, the choice of what app they use to accept payment, if they can handle waiting on a confirmation if the network is slow, and whether they need a method to transfer quickly back into fiat to reduce volatility.

Coinbase is the no frills portal for first time buyers and technically illiterate friends and relatives. Coinbase Pro is the companion site that offers an interface closer to that used by professional traders.

What makes you think ETH and EOS will tank?  Thus far, we've seen two scenarios: bitcoin does well and alts do better, or bitcoin tanks and alts tank more. It's relatively unseen that there is a long term increase in bitcoin against fiat and alts simultaneously.
Caveat: I have zero exposure to EOS. But ETH has a solid platform, and it inspires innovation. If the cryptosphere does well, ETH is almost assured a spot in the pantheon.  And traditionally, everyone hedges against bitcoin and enters alts only when bitcoin shows health.

Ha, fair point when pulling back that far.  Definitely before my time in the space.
I'm still an advocate for a diversified portfolio. I'll also acknowledge that I don't know what the ecosystem has been before I got in. But it seems like the current coins have been working to differentiate themselves from bitcoin in ways that will help them find their niches \(privacy, smart contracts, etc\). Yes, these are all things that bitcoin can also do with ample time, but the more successful bitcoin gets, the more it must slow its pace to sustain its strength. Small companies are more flexible than behemoths \(look at how litecoin evolved to being a test case for bitcoin's tech advancements\), and as time progresses, the "I'm buying this alt because I can get more quantity of coins" effect will continue to grow.

Again, nothing is certain. But TA has a quantifiable market predictive effect when taken as an aggregate over an extended period  \(with better results coming from volatile industries, of which crypto definitely qualifies\).

Lottery tickets have a negative EV.
The stock market has a theoretically positive EV, but not high enough to match the interest rate of most loans unless you get a great deal.
In the latter case, I would consider a bank loan if I thought my return was likely to net a higher value that the bank interest. Is that in crypto?: no. It's not that I don't trust crypto long term, it's just that it is still possible that this bear market will continue for years. I don't \*think\* it will, I \*hope\* it won't, but that doesn't make it so.
Still, if the bank was willing to loan me 100k at an interest rate lower than say 5% compounded annually, and I could diversify my investments across the entire market from crypto to FAANG to mutual funds, absolutely I'd take it. I don't see this any different than a normal business loan. But then, I trade on the stock market as a side hobby, and other than crypto, I've pulled a profit with my investments (and I still have faith in my crypto investments, simply by the fact that I have no intention or need to sell anything while I'm at a loss, so either crypto goes to zero or I profit after enough DCA).

One piece of constructive criticism: I see absolutely no identifying information on your site. No links to real people as employees, no pictures of people wearing your shirts, etc.
How do I know that your site isn’t simply a series of mockups meant to solicit cryptocash? Especially when the only contact is a reddit user “Hugh_Jazz699” (which I do think is funny, but it’s a questionable lead-in to a business relationship).
I want to support crypto businesses, but there’s extra trust that needs to be built into these interactions when conducting business online.

People aren't used to keeping their own money because it hasn't been feasible to carry enough funds with you to use whatever you might need without going through a trusted intermediary or risking theft. Crypto solves these problems, but it isn't yet convenient enough for the average person.  Someone on this forum mentioned"As easy as Venmo" and I think that's a good benchmark. There are still excessive moments of friction in transitioning to crypto, but those will get smoothed out as services develop better UIs and people are given smoother ways to pay with crypto to people who don't want to receive crypto in return.

Almost everyone has something to hide. It doesn’t have to be overt malfeasance, but most people don’t want to be audited, whether it’s taxes or process.

Some costs are already paid, some costs are subsidized by government and/or corruption (depending on your view, this might be the same thing), some costs are passed on to the community (pollution and related environmental damage \[these were probably not factored directly into the analysis valuation, although it is reflected in countries  that use more expensive energy but pass along some of those fees to reduce environmental effects\]), and some miners are amassing bitcoin now expecting the coins to be worth more later.

I'm really surprised there hasn't been more analysis for or against this theory. People have either reported the single buyer theory as fact, or disregarded it as fake news. Apparently, the crux of the argument is that volume increased on three exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp), but those exchanges are on the short list of exchanges who don't fake their volume, so one would expect them to increase during a bull spike regardless of whether or not it was one buyer or one thousand.
Has anyone looked into whether volume spiked on other non-faked exchanges, or if there was a clear grouping of buys that wouldn't have been explained by multiple buyers?

This isn’t necessarily the case, since overall Bitcoin has gained more value than it’s lost. Sure there are lots of trades where people lost value, but there are many occasions where people bought low, carried bitcoin through a rough patch, and then sold to a new seller who repeated that process.
The longer bitcoin survives through bear markets, the stronger its value to the world. People who have carried bitcoin through its lowest perceived times have traditionally been rewarded when the bull market returns.

I have in the past and C-Pro's .15% was definitely lower than Cash's 1%+, but apparently Cash's fees are adjusted depending on market volatility. So I'll have to concede that there are times when Cash's fees are lower. Looks like the optimal play would be to buy from Cash when the market is stable (such as now), and from someone with specifically set fees under .25% when the market is swinging wildly (in which case, I would want to set a limit order anyway, which Cash doesn't allow).
[Happy to hear what Cash's current spread is....I can't confirm it since I have no money on the app at the moment, and they won't show me the actual fee unless I have fiat ready to transfer].

This is more about the difference between crypto as speculation and crypto as an end-product. Many people speculate on crypto, often without actually purchasing and owning the underlying coin. That subset of the community may be argued to be a zero-sum game (although I would argue that crypto speculation is a form of marketing to increase overall mindshare and bridge the path towards adoption). In any case, the system itself still has inherent and growing value for those who use crypto as currency (or for its many other applications, such as smart contracts, immutable ledger, etc.).
Just because lots of people are gambling on crypto’s future doesn’t mean they get to define or represent the totality of the space.

@_date: 2018-11-27 20:05:53
This is not true. Value is gained from increased utility after holding over time. If someone buys a coin for $100 when it can be spent at 100 locations &amp; holds it until it can be spent at 1000 locations for $1000; the original selller didn’t lose money because they sold at $100, the hodler gained value, and the new owner of the coin isn’t out anything because they can exchange or hold as they see fit.
Value can also diminish. If adoption decreases, the economy collapses, or for whatever reason no one wants to exchange a coin at the $1000 price, then the value would drop accordiningly. But that has nothing to do with the greater fool theory or zero-sum gains, just the economics of diminished utility.
I love Mcafee for all his wacky antics, but he’s not an economist. Yes, there is a hell of a lot of price speculation in crypto &amp; everyone has theories about where the price should be. But there is actual, legitimate value created through crypto (instantaneous transfers, public ledger, protection against centralization), and more value will be created the more the technology evolves and matures.

Why not? People want to buy as cheap as they can. There have been more people thinking the price is going to fall than rise. If the price is falling, most people will wait to see how far it goes. Ultimately, the market of buyers and sellers is still relatively small, so the market is volatile.

If an option exists where conventional investment firms are suddenly able to purchase bitcoin to their heart’s content, where before they were barred from entering the market, that will help bitcoin’s adoption overall.
Right now, the technology is almost there, but the price fluctuations hurt adoption. I can’t even pay my babysitter in bitcoin, even though she hodls, because she’s tapped out during this bear market. The more the world involves itself with crypto, the stronger crypto becomes.

I have that question. Unless Robinhood is hedging by purchasing bitcoin when it’s user’s “purchase” bitcoin (which isn’t actually bitcoin, but basically an IOU redeemable for a future equivalent price of Bitcoin), then this will result in a negative affect (at least short term) on bitcoin’s price, as every Robinhood sale would be a potential loss of an actual bitcoin purchase on the real exchanges.

Well, by the end of 2017, my crypto account had effectively tripled in value from my initial purchases. I was day trading crypto-to-crypto exclusively, which wasn’t specifically a taxable event in 2017 but has since been clarified to be taxable starting in 2018.
Since December, however, the market has slumped again, and now my account is holding steady at just about my original fiat buy-in. But if I was to claim crypto-to-crypto, I’d have to liquidate 1/3 of my holdings just to cover the tax bill.
This group, among other things, is aiming to restore crypto-to-crypto “like-kind” exchanges as tax exempt. This would save me and many others a significant tax bill, which would be helpful since I never actually liquidated any notable amount of holdings into fiat in 2017.

There is no such thing as a safe investment. The best you can do is research appealing options and make your best guess about where to store value. Many, many people hold a significant chunk of their savings in low-yield USD accounts, and consider that the “safe” option. Every choice is relative, and no one knows the optimal decision.
I hold a significant chunk in crypto, because I think it’s the optimal choice given all my available options and my assesment of each’s statistical probablistic growth. But crypto is not safe, has never been safe, and if it ever becomes safe, would no longer be potentially the most lucrative.

\&gt; For every trade that makes a loss there is the counterparty and the exchange making a profit. So all daytraders are on average losing money.
Depends on the exchange. Coinbase offers 0% limit orders.  There are ways to mitigate expenses day-trading to the point that it comes down to whether you have the temperament and if you are backing the right horse. A profitable venture is better than zero-sum, because the investments that gain value sap resources from the investments that are duds. In that case, the single gambling moment is your choice of fiat/crypto to hold, for however long you hold it.
\&gt; I would classify it as similar gambling as playing poker.
Some people are better day traders than others, just like poker. There are disciplines and techniques that can help.  Whether OP has the temperament for it is a completely difference issue (since, granted, most people do not).

How about I take the 100 best performing NASDAQ US stocks over the last month, you take the 100 worst. For every one our stocks that gains the next day, the other owes us $2. For every one of ours that drops, we owe $1. 
Honestly, I’m not inclined to make financial wagers with strangers online, but if anyone wants to backdate these figures over a sufficient time frame, my proposal is that this is not going to end up in a coin flip, and I’d be happy to admit I’m incorrect if I’m wrong.
Another option would be to simply track any major stock index for the last x years. If it went down one day, bet $5 that it will go down the next. If it goes up, same bet for rising.  My (fully falsifiable) hypothesis is that the trend will predict better than 51% over a long enough time frame.

Why would I agree to something that shifts the odds so substantially?  Beating a 2% spread is statistically reasonable, and still subjects me to decent risk. I would be overjoyed if the numbers found that trends have a 2-4% influence over the market. If your 15% spread was fair , which is laughable, that would be mortgage the house levels of risk/reward and there’s no way the market would allow that level of easy money.

Imprecise. The gambler’s fallacy supposes the opposite: that because the gambler has undergone a series of losses, they are inevitably due a winning streak to compensate.
I am simply pointing out that there is a scientifically verifiable trend between stocks, in which those which exhibit a cluster of rises or falls have a greater than 50% chance of repeating said pattern in the next iteration. The greater the trend, the greater odds of repeatability.
Anyone who says that XX is 100% going to happen is a fool. But that’s doesn’t eliminate the value of market prediction, actuary tables, technical analysis, etc.  “We cannot predict the future” does not mean “we can’t make predictions of the future and be right better than 50% of the time with a large enough sample size.”

OK, since no one is actually posting the explanation:
When the market dropped below $11000, it triggered a bundle of stop losses (which says that if the price drops below X, sell so the seller isn't left holding the bag). This  dropped the price to 10,000, which triggered more stop losses, panic sells, and people attempting a falling knife catch (those hoping to sell high and buy back in at a lower rate).
For the bulls, this is a good sign. It means that despite a sudden drop, the bears weren't able to parlay the sale into a serious dip, and the price re-asserted itself.
Stop losses are a normal and necessary part of most conventional trading systems (and vital if someone is trading on margin), but for crypto they can be a double-edged sword.

Most of the people predicting a lower dip are basing it on technical analysis of the charts, not news-driven fundamentals.

Feel free to correct me if I’m wrong, but my understanding is that OTC trades pay a premium over the market price, not a discount.

Well, if they wanted to day trade, it's an option. Transferring at current fees would be about $0.15. I'm not a shill, so there are other options that would offer more coin options. For example, Bittrex has a fee, but since it's calculated as a percentage of the transaction price (.25%), OP would just have to make a profit over .25% a trade to make a profit.

Oops, I did misreport the gambler’s fallacy, my bad and I appreciate the correction.
I haven’t done a lot of digging, but the claim that stock prices are random seems preposterous. 
My beginning research found 
“The only conclusion that can be drawn is that there may be some momentum effects, in the short term, and a weak mean reversion effect, in the long term.”
While this didn’t report a strong effect, it seems to acknowledge that one was there, and even a weak effect is leveraged with a properly diversified portfolio.
Even a .5% correlation would be enough to make a wise investor money. That’s also all a card counter needs to beat the house.

This is incorrect.  Past behavior is not a guarantee, but to reduce it to a cliche ignores that trends are a valid market force.
Take any two random stocks. One has fallen 25 of the last 30 days, one has increased at the same ratio. To claim that the market is “unpredictable and inconsistent” says that we should give both stocks equal chance of increasing tomorrow or decreasing.
Do they both have a chance to rise or fall? Yes. Is it equal? Absolutely not.

In this case, there is a bit of a zero-sum game with mining resources. During times when the BCH difficulty adjustment lowers  the challenge, miners divert power to BCH, increasing BTC transaction times. RThere is also split attention from investors, talented programmers, adoption evangelists, etc.
Just like BCH, x2 doesn’t want to peacefully coexist beside BTC, but to replace it as the de facto standard. This is seen as a threat to people who want BTC to hold onto its philosophies of decentralization and community consensus, as BCH and B2X are based on different principles.

That tells me that we are arguing against slightly different positions. My argument is that trends are statistically significant and profitable in outlier scenarios when partnered with a responsible betting system.  This may or may not hold when looking at the stock market on average, since the data would be diluted by the percentage of stocks that are moving back and forth within range.
That said, I’d still love to test your theory. We need a random range of performers on a particular exchange, and closing data for a random three day range.  I would hypothesize that movement on the second day predicts the closing on the third greater than 52% of the time.

This kind of phrase is often thrown around as if it's a mocking glimpse of a truism, but past performance is the \*only\* indicator we have for future performance.  Indicator does not imply a truth writ in stone, just that it is a piece of the puzzle. To say otherwise would be to suggest that BTC has an equal chance to be between $9,000-$11,000 USD in 24 hours as it does to be &lt;$1k or &gt;$200k. 
We can look at the history and make theories, and studies show that TA has a better chance of guessing the outcome than a coin flip. It might not be \*much\* better than a coin flip, but it's what we have to work with, and with a properly leveraged portfolio, being right 51-55% of the time is more than enough.

Most of the people who say TA is bullshit start from some variant on “TA can’t be right all the time, or everyone would use it” or just “TA isn’t right all the time, so there.”
Most people who support TA consider it a single tool in their bag. It doesn’t need to be 100% effective to be a good tool, just better than 50%. 
The only large scale study I’ve read on the subject (sorry, I don’t have the link atm), said that TA’s slight advantage exists but is largely eaten up by trading fees, but that the advantage for TA increases in emerging markets with low liquidity.
Many people use TA exclusively to decide when to set their price targets. If anyone wants to challenge this, it would be pretty easy to backtest two strategies, one that buys whenever the RSI is above 80 and sells below 20, and the other the opposite.

Well, not a tax professional, but the situation is that by claiming (and reiterating recently) that crypto is considered property, the IRS may have tacitly allowed for crypto-to-crypto to be considered a non-taxed like-kind exchange through 2017.  This loophole was closed in the recent 2018 tax bill, which is why everyone is certain that like-kind is taxed for any trades made after dec 31, 2017. But in the meanwhile, many of us are making a good faith assumption (based on everything listed above, as well as the IRS not taking any of its opportunities to correct the assumption) that crypto-to-crypto trades before 2018 are not taxed.

 They do round up a penny in their stock sales, (which adds up significantly for them), but haven’t claimed they do this with crypto.

Your reply is thorough and I wanted to give it appreciation.
My one source in rebuttal is the most extensive study that I am aware of regarding TA: 
To be clear: this study concluded that TA was not statistically relevant. I want to acknowledge that, while drawing attention to its qualifications:
"The majority of US studies find that technical analysis does not add value after transaction costs are accounted for."
Most crypto exchanges offer significantly lower costs than the average stock transaction, and regardless this quote posits TA as offering better results than a coin flip, the only arguments are against the study's methodology or whether the difference is significant over cost, not over random effectiveness. 
"For instance Cooper (1999) finds filter rules based on both price and volume generate profits after relatively low estimates of transaction costs are taken into account"
This to me fits crypto to a T, as long as one is using one of the better markets.
The paper included in its results:
"There is widespread evidence of rules producing statistically significant profits, but the statistical significance is not strong enough to rule out the possibility that it could be due to chance. We find some evidence that technical analysis is more profitable in emerging markets but this is
relatively weak."
That is clearly not a slam dunk argument. I acknowledge this, though I hope most of the people reading this would conclude that crypto is an emerging market.
So that is what I have to offer. It's the best data I have. Can you present anything of equal or better focus that would give more light to the situation? I am open to adjusting my understanding, but a horde of people saying an aphorism about past performance is not going to sway me, and I've only read what I've read, and even the dissenting scientific research that I've read has told me that crypto and TA have something in common.

The hard drive requirements to run a full node are already prohibitively large for some people (I am one of them). Doubling the block size will further increase centralization and have a greater than zero effect on adoption.
Maybe increasing the block size is worth that trade-off, but the longer we go without doing it, the more flexible bitcoin can be in the future 
Possibly silly thought: what if we get a notable evolution in hard drives in 5 years and everyone would have been able to host a node through their smartphones/smartwatches/refrigerators, but doubling our block size too early killed our ability to expand in that way.

Not that an exchange couldn’t do this, nor to suggest that it doesn’t happen. But this kind of shady behavior is detectable.

Personally benefits that might also apply:

A relatively-educated populous
A low expectation of kidnappings and other aggressive crimes when going out after dark
Personally, I went to public school, and then only managed college due to grants and student loans. I'm still paying them off, but I have trouble not being thankful for the opportunity. I mean, my education wasn't great, but I wasn't put in a sweatshop when I was 10 either. 
However, I do think the US does a piss-poor job in how it allocates its resources. We're corrupt, overly-aggressive as a military and police force, and pale to virtually every other first-world country in terms of education. But hey, at least we can voice our displeasure about it online and maybe someday someone will do something about it :-)

I don’t think this is correct. Wash trading is specifically used to inflate volume on an exchange. If it was an altcoin, it would be more reasonable that it was an outside agent attempting to inflate a coin’s value (although if you already have 85m...) Since it’s btc, the actor that would benefit most from wash trading is the exchange themselves.
Any centralized exchange should be able to manufacture the appearance of a buy order without needing the funds. This *may* be easier than simply having the funds and washing them to inflate volume, or harder, depending on how their back-end is configured, the amount of people necessary to keep the action secret, etc.
(I’m definitely not saying this is wash trading or a fake buy wall, just commenting on the theoretical possibility of wash trading happening without funds).

Well, I was born in poverty, only got the advantages I did thanks to welfare, food stamps, social services to get my mother and her kids away from an abusive household, etc. I know that there are better places, but only about 8% of the world lives in a developed country, so I just figure that if the dice were rolled again for where I was born, it probably would have been a harder life, not easier.
So, yeah, I owe a *lot* of debt. And it's a major stress and source of depression. But I'm still thankful for my opportunities. (The irony is that after finally getting a better paying job and being able to pay back into the system, it's through a career that needed no college, only a 6-week training program....which to be fair, I wouldn't have been able to attend had I not been on unemployment at the time).


I wouldn't use the word wrong, but I agree this is a sticky situation, and I'm conflicted about it. I think it's a moral good to encourage an educated population. But we also live in a world of youtube, Apple University, public libraries, and many other free resources.  Also, I have lots of weird trainings. Should the government have paid for my degree in dance? Physical theatre? Massage? (all actual examples, but I also studied graphic design, bookkeeping, business, and computer science).  Some of those were from private institutions, some of those were public. Some of those skills I later monetized, most of them help me in weird and lateral ways in my job and life. Definitely for a chunk of that, I was just staying in school to avoid getting a "real job". I think an optimal civilization would have assisted me with part of that process (and it did), but I'm not sure where the line gets drawn.


Absolutely agree.  I only quibble on the idea that things like extended education are "rights", partly due to a libertarian bent, but I would say that it's in *most* of our interests to have a healthy and educated population and I think it would behoove us as a country to better emulate other first-world nations.

Ok, by insiders I meant the people who have been investing in bitcoin since the early days. (You were correct to call me on it, I was completely incorrect in that usage). The overwhelming message has been that we are repeating a cycle that has been seen many, many times. 
My use of fundamentals was literal. The technology has value and is continuing to increase in real world adoption.
I am definitely an optimist. But I do not expect to see crypto’s death knell without a black swan event. Otherwise, technical analysis says that we are in a correction, nothing more.

TA doesn’t mean “nothing”, it’s just not the full picture. No legitimate technical analyst will claim they know the future. Charting helps assess probabilities of movements and potential areas of resistance.

Bitcoin has been in correction and consolidation for the last five months. Most of the people who have been tracking this have thought that the price was lower than it should have been, but there were still weak hands to shake out after the too-fast jump towards $20k (BTC is worth much more than 20k, but it happened waaaaay too fast, and without the benefit of this moment to test that it could go up, down, and then up again).
Maybe we’ll now rocket up to 20k, maybe it’ll take some more oscillation. The trend has always been up, with fits and starts, as anyone who looks at the long term chart can see. 
The majority of us have been expecting the inevitable rise, baring some black swan event that changes the narrative (and “BTC got too pricey too quick” doesn’t fit the bill).

No need to use a third party to calculate. It’ll be long term capital gains, taxed at 15% or 20% of the sales profit, depending on OP’s income for the year.

Wow, here I am worried that the $5k loan I'm borrowing against my 401k at 3.5% was risky. (Protip: it is)
Ok, the biggest problem against this plan is that it is betting that bitcoin will continue to do better than your  accumulating debt at 30% interest. Just because bitcoin has shown those gains in the past doesn't mean it will continue to do so. Bitcoin's meteroric rise was based on the majority of the world's complete uncertainty of its base value. The longer it stays around, the more it looks like a safe bet to people like you and me, the slower it's going to gain.
If Bitcoin continued to gain in value over the next ten years, at even 10% annual growth, that would be a success. Even 20% would be *amazing*. But you'd be stuck with a debt accumulating interest at 30%. 
If you wanted to pay back your debt in four years, you would have to pay over $1200 a month. If you really can afford that, then buy $1200 in bitcoin every month instead.
If you can't swing that much, then just buy $1000 in bitcoin a month, since that's what it will take you to pay off that credit card debt in 8 years. That means you'd have 36k invested in bitcoin in three years with zero debt.
 Sure, if the market price soars between now and then, you would have less coin. But the price has already soared.  It will never see the gains it had in its first years. There's just no reason for it do so, since it's already convinced most intelligent people who look into it that the tech is solid and the coin has utility (sure it has its detractors, but they are becoming more and more a minority).

What's the problem? It's a legitimate loss. The wash trade rules don't apply to crypto. Trading to an alt, even a shitcoin, heck, even tether, is a taxable event. You get to declare $3k in losses a year for a long time, but it will reset your purchase date, so if the market turns around in the next 12 months and you cash out, you are subjected to short-term capital gains instead of long. 
Everyone in the US (and possibly other countries with similar laws) has this option. It involves trade-offs, but it is completely above board and there is zero reason you couldn't support it with exchange records if required.

There are strong arguments for swapping to create a tax loss, but it should be mentioned: this resets your duration  for capital gains (at least in US). So if the market turns around in the next twelve months and you trade for profit, you are on the hook for short term capital gains rather than long term (and your losses from this year can only defer $3k against your profits).
This may be important or not, depending on an individual's position and what happens in the next 12 months, but it should be considered.

From what I’ve read on the largest scale study I’m aware of, there is a greater than 50% success rate with TA, which is magnified in newer markets with more volitility and less liquidity. The study (I’m sorry I don’t have the link) concluded that most TA advantage in conventional markets were eaten by trading fees, but still suggested there was a 5-10% gain over a coin flip.

Bitcoin has first mover advantage and a ten year head start. Anything you do with your coin will still have a decade less proof of stability and community support.
There are already hundreds if not thousands of coins that have attempted a similar feat. A crypto project has to offer something fresh if it wants to stand out in the sea of copycats, scams, and shitcoins (plus the projects that are honestly innovating).
If you have these theoretical millions of followers, you could definitely launch a succesful crypto project. But for a crypto to replace bitcoin, it would have to be somehow better than bitcoin, not just the same but ten years less history and community involvement.
