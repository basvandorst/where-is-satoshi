Do you have to pay taxes even if you have never withdrawn any money?

I have a few questions:
1) If you were so interested in bitcoin from the start ("bitcoin evangelist") how comes you don't know how much BTC you actually have?
2) If you know that you have 1-2 BTC lying around how comes you didn't search for the PC sooner?

When I was young, BTC used to cost around $16.000

How much of a drop should we expect. I don't know if I should buy at a $1000 drop or if there will be a bigger one.

Sorry but, I think 99&amp; of people here agree that hardware wallets are the safest.
Only you have access to the hardware wallet, whereas an exchange can be hacked or go backrupt, disappear with the money etc.
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:13:35
Hardware or mobile or?
Anything that I can open today.
Recommend me one that is not mobile and hardware

This may be an unpopular opinion but why not buy all coins from the top10? Even if you dont like some of them. This is a great and safe way to diversify.
@_date: 2018-06-19 06:54:20
Are you the reason why the price of bitcoin is going south?
@_date: 2018-06-04 13:30:18
Electrum? As long as your pc not a cesspool of malware you’ll be fine. Even just print a paper wallet and remove from pc.
I went for electrum. THanks for your reply.

Changing the world as we know it.
@_date: 2017-09-14 09:27:10
Nope. It buys it at a lowest price unfortunately.
So if the price is $4000 and I place a limit order at $4100 then it will buy it for $4000.

Can somebody tell me why bch isn't just another random coin? Is it because of Roger Ver and what he does on bitcoin.com or is the coin itself also shit?
