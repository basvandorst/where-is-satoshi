Just like you see social media outing the big wigs in Hollywood... I think Crypto will begin to expose exploits and corruption in our financial system. It may be a wild west in the beginning where some people come out on top... but things will balance eventually.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:06:41
Yeah they don't fuck around... and they could easily short Bitcoin. It could either go very good, or very poorly.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:05:02
It's people swing trading, that know how to cash in. This is going to correct before it goes any higher.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:09:25
This is important to understand... this news doesn't guarantee a rise in Bitcoin price... it could easily go to hurt it. Seeing a lot of people hyping this up.
@_date: 2019-11-09 11:04:03
His comment makes my brain hurt. Am I stupid or is he stupid?
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:51:31
I bought during the 2014 run... and my account remained inactive until 2017's... I had completely forgotten about it. A long positive trend and some continuous good news will bring these people back.
@_date: 2018-06-04 16:52:14
It hit the first two and is about to hit the third. Don't know what you're seeing
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:07:10
It could go either way... maybe it will shoot up... maybe it will correct to 6k area.
@_date: 2019-02-06 14:35:15
A demonic troll.... right.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:26:52
Until it unexpectedly falls or rises and you waste your time. There is really no guessing right now  
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:04:39
I cashed out after buying in from 3-4k. I'll be honest I can't deal with the volatility right now and would rather see the trend continue before making my next move... to much uncertainty. Convince me otherwise and I might be back in :p
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:06:09
Think of this one all on your own?
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:44:48
Raid the app with negative comments
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:50:42
I lol'd
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:01:41
Bitcoin would be like your bank... a giant decentralized bank. I like the idea of that.
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:43:03
His eye movements whenever he claims bitcoin cash to be the real bitcoin say everything.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:59:28
Could definitely see it retracing to 6-7k... It needs that healthy correction. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:37:08
Just seems counterintuitive to be making a joke out of something that the whole community is fighting for governments to take seriously. Scratch investors.
@_date: 2019-06-03 20:49:52
It should be made clear that this is a part of a bigger art piece... it's an easy misunderstanding
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:10:42
A healthy correction would bring us down to 5-6k
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:42:49
I think 10k will become the new low
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:38:57
Unless it goes down immediately after you buy
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:49:41
In order to make a better system, you need people to believe it's more than just "magic internet money". Newcomers may not take that as a joke. Whether it's their ignorance or not, you can't argue that it paints Bitcoin in a bad light.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:14:07
Lol right... timed that perfectly.
@_date: 2019-12-09 19:35:15
Anything to fill the void of silence for r/bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:58:48
Bitcoin is due for a big correction and I'm sure it will. I believe in it but this hype is unsustainable... You have a lot of ignorant people throwing large amounts of money at it that are going to get burned by people looking to cash out.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:29:23
Credit card would be best because you don't want to get stuck in a position you're unhappy with. This has a lot of room to fall... not that it won't be back in this area again.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:35:33
If you think this is the end of Bitcoin, then sell... personally I think we are in a correction and will see 10k again within the year. Whether we correct to 8k or 3k... no one can really be sure.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:26:55
Not the news about them selling it and how it looks to have been a player in the January crash
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:28:41
Disagree... I think there are plenty of people on the sidelines with it in the back of their minds. All it's going to take is some news of adoption paired with the easier means of purchasing crypto and boom. I think the next wave will hit even harder. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:27:56
I get so unreasonably frustrated seeing it over and over. I can't wrap my head around why people upvote the same garbage over and over... it's not original. The only unrealistic hope I have is that it's all people new to the subreddit so they haven't heard it before. Still doesn't stop me from hating the people who think they are funny posting it. ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:23:32
People would still be buying but he would demolish the wall of people buying for the current rate. Even if it's a temporary spike, it's enough to crash the market if timed right.
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:22:19
I think we're at a time where things are 'memed' into existence. It's honestly one of the reasons I believe in Bitcoin. I mean... memes did help put Trump into office. All the ridiculous hype over the coin only brings more people in. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:14:31
When forking how is it decided who gets to keep the bitcoin name?
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:39:28
I don't think I'm above anything, I actually enjoy most of it and play my part. I just want another quick source of news and good discussion.
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:52:14
Than, not then silly.
@_date: 2017-09-22 16:55:26
Bitliever, silly guy!
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:35:01
All that means is that you're invested early.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:48:18
I think looking for debate makes the community look weak. Let the value of Bitcoin do the talking and let the debate come to us. This guy is well articulated, but still think he would be walked on.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:42:07
Yeah but the price gained momentum because of news and events in the space, which then led to hype. Why would this cycle not occur again if Bitcoin is growing. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 13:19:36
What's the best option for somebidy holding money in coinbase?
@_date: 2018-07-06 13:31:01
New meta: people adding nothing to discussion by complaining about retarded memes.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:44:43
Okay, so as long as I deposit into a paper wallet I'm safe either way
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:43:38
What is the best way to get both coins?
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:41:44
The upcoming fork is going to be so damn interesting. Especially with all the newbs that this 5k news will bring in. Sounds like another opportunity to buy the dip?
@_date: 2019-09-16 11:51:36
When you post these I'd include a picture of the full artwork so people understand. I remember the last time you posted and both time its took me a bit to realize there is more to this than just the QR code.
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:07:17
suggestions of where to go with it? any way to get both coins if they split?
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:42:30
And so are thousands of other people, which is why you will never get it at what you are "waiting" for.
@_date: 2018-07-06 14:59:46
Reddit is one of the top 5 visited sites on the internet...you are not special.  Instead of wasting energy complaining, make good content.
@_date: 2018-07-06 15:22:16
If you don't like the content I'd recommend not clicking on memes in and adding to the discussion. Maybe go to I'm not complaining lol, I made a joke that apparently triggered you even more. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:16:46
"idiots losing money"... are we looking at the same charts? you predicting it imploding on itself makes you just as big of an "idiot" as the people who guarantee it succeeding. Nobody knows what will happen. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:39:28
I don't think I'm above anything, I actually enjoy most of it and play my part. I just want another quick source of news and good discussion.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:44:00
Okay so I'll be taking it out, but what is the best way to get both coins?
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:27:10
"A correction is a reverse movement, usually negative, of at least 10% in a stock, bond, commodity or index to adjust for an overvaluation."
Quite literally the definition of a correction.
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:29:35
I'm bullish on Bitcoin, but the lack of common sense in these boards is frustrating.
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:28:53
I think it's pretty obvious that he is referring to the 70% correction we've had in the past 4 months.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:16:53
Because it's interesting to get other thoughts on it? Some end up being right
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:41:41
Even if there is another crash, there will be so many more people on board by that time that cheaper coins will be purchased and the value will rise right back up. As long as people believe in the technology, bitcoin value will continually rise.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:16:44
How do you do this? And can you do this after an order is pending?
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:47:23
Was the amount you received the value of bitcoin when you clicked sell or the value after 4 days of waiting for it to clear? 
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:36:42
As long as the technology is doing well people should be willing to make the long term investment...
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:49:09
Can you link your Coinbase wallet up to the blockchain app? I have yet to make a purchase and sincerely don't know how it works. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:42:41
Was it instant for trade?
