So much bullshit.

Well, I’ll call bullshit!  I bought early because I did (and do) believe in crypto - so I won’t get hurt either way - but make no mistake - this is about money - about enriching your life.
Prove me wrong, send me some coins fam - cuz - it’s about community, and I could use a few more!
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:27:16
Then send out some coins to someone in the “community” - it doesn’t have to be me, just someone in that needs it!

You post “ticket updates” on Reddit?  Are you fucking kidding? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:24:14
There isn’t, are you high or stupid?

Why "upvote" stupid shit like this?

Did you do any research before making your “investment”?   There’s a reason people don’t buy 1/100 share of AAPL - it’s fucking stupid and the fees outweigh any potential gains.

that may be the dumbest thing I’ve read all day, and I’ve read some fucked up shit.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:35:12
Yup to both, and you still win.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:43:50
Oh please - seriously?  People shouldn't mention their success because it might make someone else feel bad?  Fuck!  Sack up snowflake - the world doesn't revolve around your feelings.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:23:20
And your “upvotes” will accomplish this is?

You discussed it over the weekend, they jump in head first and now curse you... bullshit.
