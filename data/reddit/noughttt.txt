You thinking my dude
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:12:04
But what if you look at crypto currency as an investment. I’m speaking as someone who doesn’t invest recklessly 
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:10:32
Very good point 
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:05:57
Very true 
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:13:31
shits on sale boys HODL up
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:31:31
Exactly, I feel like by the time a recession would occur bitcoin would be stable / reputable enough in the public’s eyes that it very well might be what the people need to hedge capital in a tough time
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:14:19
Also very valid , something to think about
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:04:03
What would this solve? I’m sure people can do the math in their heads to see the prices they have to pay if they want to get in this new ecosystem, get with the times or don’t enter this space.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:16:39
Dw man you couldn’t have known
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:32:26
Exactly 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:37:56
would we get to a point where its really expensive for a small value of btc like 0.0000001 BTC. Also wouldn't that clog the block chain with all these micro transactions? that is unless we add lightning network
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:48:07
I guess but if someone wants to invest in btc they would do minimal research that would reveal that about btc 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:33:54
Source: 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:35:52
how would that effect price tho? there would still be that many bitcoins around. that would just make it possible for people to split it easily among large groups
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:53:52
Yes that is obvious but In the long term let’s say a little bit getting lost here and there wouldn’t there be a constant increase in the bitcoin price and wouldn’t the future generations have less and less to work with? Or would we get to a point where we wouldn’t value btc with fiat it would just be what it is? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:22:28
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:18:04
theres like 4-5 mill gone forever from mishandling them :( so there will be even less at the 21mill mark
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:41:56
i assume your doing that just to play it safe? which is a great idea but invest in what you think each coins potential is, and usually if one coin goes up the other is dropping so you may not even get profits at the end of the day
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:12:37
Okay I’ll leave them as they are till I have a need to move them . Also with keeping my coins safe, where do you think is the safest place for them, exodus doesn’t have a passcode option so I’m Gona delete it off my pc ( is that safe will I loose my bitcoins ?)  I got the recovery phrase and blockchain has my balance still. I know hardware wallets like ledger or trezor are good but I don’t feel the need to go there YET..
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:15:28
What’s a seed key? Is it the recovery phrase 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:02:42
What will block explorer show me? What do I put in the search bar? My address? Also what’s a seed key?
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:12:34
If you don’t have the private keys you don’t have access to your funds because that is the only thing proving that you own that amount of bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:54:47
So that means I can send bitcoin away from both?
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:11:56
I’m playing this on repeat till 10k who’s with me!?
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:23:34
On the ledger your wallet private keys are never sent off the device, you simply sign the transaction on the ledger device with a pin and the result leaves the ledger nano. It’s so safe that you can plug it into a pc with malware and nothing will touch your private keys. As for tails it’s great for anonymity but idk about recovering data from it when in the ledger you can simplify get everything back with the 20or so words they tell you to remember. But that’s just my opinion ��
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:26:32
Surpass 12k by Christmas 
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:17:54
exactly! you cant have all your eggs in one basket, its the wild wild west out here.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:34:22
Also coinwarz has useful returns calculator you can mess around with 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:21:21
Yea some part of me thinks it won’t drop for long after 10k
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:54:40
They can both coexist but there would need to be something keeping both coins relevant, one possible way that i can see this happening is one is used for every day transactions and the other as an investment. 
Tell me what your ideas are on that. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:53:42
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:05:24
Also I’ve noticed that on blockchain I have many addresses all with diffrent amounts of btc on them? How can I make them go on one 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:04:28
Interesting 
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:18:36
Look up what the difference between a public key and a private key is on YouTube 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:24:25
Asia wakes up aha
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:26:50
You can’t mine on your phone with profit 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:01:06
Yea I wasn’t a fan of their bs so I was wondering what you guys thought 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:51:54
What happened?
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:14:20
There are 2 ways to recover your bitcoin
1. If you have the recovery words they gave you when you opened the wallet 
2. The actual private key that you can simplify import to another wallet and claim the bitcoin as your own
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:10:30
Sell and gain a better position tho? Or don’t risk it ? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:05:31
Sorry I’m just trying help my dad out this year 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:50:40
Block chain is compromised by all the people who exhibit FOMO
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:42:19
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:55:29
Recover your private keys and import them to a wallet that allows for this I think exodus can do this easily
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:50:24
Loool he said bit chain 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:22:17
Okay sweet I’m up to speed now
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:58:47
Well you need the computer
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:47:34
whyyyy! you know the rule HODL
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:14:40
Yea change that
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:11:31
Here are the basics, when you open up a wallet you are given a private key and a public key, the private key is yours and no one else’s, if Some one finds out the long code usually more than 30 random numbers and digits they can import al your bitcoin for themselves. Your public key is  30-34 digest and letters and it’s only used to accept bitcoins from others. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:25:53
Do not. This could get you into allot of trouble legally 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:07:55
But that would require me to send it and endure a transaction fee correct?
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:18:12
More options with Segwit. No harm in doin so
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:06:52
Well, bitcoin has been through allot of "trouble" and it has recovered. the community is strong when it comes to BTC. it wont go down unless something fundamentally goes wrong 
Once coinbase starts selling Bitcoin cash the price will go up due to another outlet of purchase but cant be too sure
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:51:15
Lol it’s not bandwagoning it’s a way of lyfe doood 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:59:10
Oh my don’t use bitcoin core that’s a “thick wallet” just use exodus it’s way better
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:32:57
hodl, and buy when its cheap
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:18:44
Haha so true �� 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:36:04
No I think it will be small scale, there is so much about 10k btc that an altcoin wont really take headlines but that’s just my understanding ��
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:03:22
See, thats the thing id rather have one strong coin then 2 or 3 that are all fighting for the spotlight
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:04:08
You need the private keys and that’s the only way, blockchain doesn’t know you opened them before nor does it care, if you don’t have access to that laptop you simply don’t have access to that wallet
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:45:39

Hypnotherapy ����
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:20:10
i can only imagine XD
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:44:00
Again another reason we shouldn’t lost 10k celebrations yet ��
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:18:09
If you recorded a specific amount of words in a specific order you can reclaim your wallet or if you recorded your private keys you can import it and claim your bitcoin if not I’m sorry but there’s no way to prove you own that to the blockchain 
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:06:16
You need access to the private keys if you don’t have them you don’t have the coins
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:24:41
Agreed 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:53:37
Yea he doesn’t have it backed up so to get the backup ( private keys) he’s gotta find the laptop with that info instilled in it
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:57:15
Also are recovery phrases universal? Like I said I used the phrase from my blockchain in exodus just to see and it did import 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:16:05
I feel it will reach 10k fast because people simply want to see that happen ��
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:19:27
Very legit 
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:57:46
For sure there will be a bear market at 10k, buy and hold and 20k will come faster than you think 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:00:26
Shouldn’t rBitcoin be everything bitcoin and rbtc be bitcoin legacy lol
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:29:14
Yea I think we should say it has officially reached 10k if all active exchanges are over that 10k threshold 
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:33:46
Yea you can keep using it forever but if you loose it it’s gone unless you copy the private key and import it to a wallet service that can accept that, paper wallets are great for storage because you can payout to it and the bitcoins still are associated with your wallet even though it’s offline. Once you import your private key to a wallet it will check the blockchain and will give you your respective bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:38:14
Export to exodus wallet and it will appear as btc and bch if you got both of the wallets active 
@_date: 2019-04-01 18:43:07
Yea you bring up a good point
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:00:05
Your essentially reviewing every single bitcoin transaction in the history of the blockchain to be a node, also has wallet features 
@_date: 2019-04-01 18:47:32
Yea thats true, but just posting at all online is not advised when its about finances, even having info on someone is enough to get extorted, eg, if crypto is taxed and you know someone at work isnt declaring, you can demand payment to remain quiet, and if you post about crypto the govt bodies will have a hard time believing you do t have crypto, i know the example was weak but hopefully if got my point across
@_date: 2019-04-01 16:56:34
yea so if they cant hack the wallet, they gona hack you, by taking ur family and demanding payment, they let you do all the hard work with deciding whats more valuable
@_date: 2019-04-01 16:54:45
dontt even start, win7 is the best os windows released, its a shame they will dis continue support next year, :(
@_date: 2019-04-01 18:28:19
No one brags about bank transfers here
@_date: 2019-04-01 16:57:29
doesnt know how the internet works do you?
@_date: 2019-04-01 18:31:30
Thats scary, people look for recent posts anything, common usernames on other platforms, things you liked, allot can be attributed to your location more than you think. 
@_date: 2019-04-01 21:24:02
Brag about depreciating value
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:05:49
Way to open with open arms yo ��
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:01:42
Is bitpay from bitcoin core?
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:48:17
buddy why are you manipulating the time scales. the one in 2014 was much faster than the crash now. stop misleading people or add dates
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:47:36
Well this didnt age well

Mobile mining rig... ill sign up for that ico
@_date: 2018-03-13 17:13:04
 complaining that he is comparing btc to apple, HES NOT
He’s just trying to shed light on the fact that todays prices are discouraging but with time and innovation it can be a great thing that everyone appreciates 
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:44:48
I was thinking the same
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:50:52
Mine had scuffs on it dont worrry man, just reset it a couple times and your good
