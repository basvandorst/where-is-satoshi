Yeah, the big blockers have their chain. So can we please encourage L2 adoption with a temporary blocksize decrease?
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:25:22
It's the best course of action to keep the blockchain size managable until cheap storage can catch up. We need decentralized easy to set-up nodes or we will just be another too-big-to-fail payment institution.

Bcash will never overtake the real bitcoin

You're fucking wrong motherfucker. Learn how cryptocurrencies work before mouthing off
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:20:20
He must have had a good reason for doing so.
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:19:34
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:17:54
No the spam attacks would just get more costly. 300kb would just let the real tx through. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:43:10
2x will bring 8mb blocks and huge centralisation pressure on miners. Slower block propagation time and higher rate of blockchain bloat, increasing the barrier of entry for new nodes. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:05:09
This guy gets it.
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:46:56
What? IBM has made 5nm silicon. We're getting new developments in high speed storage and memory. Moore law will hold true for a while yet.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:16:59
LN will be adopted faster with a TEMPORARY blocksize reduction.
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:30:03
Block time has a definitive lower bound, every decrease in the block time increases the likelihood of someone mining an old block and creating an orphaned chain, wasting hashpower. We need to provide time for the blocks to propagate. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:50:17
Nope. They can double spend coins they already own. THATS IT CUNT
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:48:21
You don't know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:47:20
If a checkpoint was agreed upon every x blocks, nodes could choose how far back to store the blockchain independently. If someone wanted to be secure, a few full history nodes could be available for auditing, but each node can optionally prune to the nearest checkpoint, and save as much history as the disk space allows. I.e. 100gb capped rolling blockchain up to the nearest checkpoint. Or 500gb or 1tb. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:47:23
Segwit is already 2mb.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:41:40
Fees are what they are.
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:57:02
Yeah but we could drop the spam tx from the mempool. There's no point clogging up the blockchain with 1 sat/b transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:11:02
Why not
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:18:22
I don't disagree
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:41:19
Nah read how crypto works mate.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:31:12
No. Segwit is 2mb. Segwit2x is 8mb.
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:47:44
Um it's a legitimate idea supported by core developer luke-jr
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:59:35
Exactly. This guy gets it.
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:47:46
Blockchain bloat is a real issue.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:30:23
Pretty sure all they can do is double spend...
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:39:36
What was the coin called?
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:37:57
I agree. I think with segwit we should be calling the blocksize at 1mb still. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:14:06
What, so you think people in the 3rd world shouldnt run nodes? What a stupid idea.
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:08:43
Do we really want all nodes centralised to those who can afford a data server? HELL NO
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:15:23
Yeah but not for useless transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:00:09
I mean technology will advance faster so it can process and store it more cheaply, not the size itself will decrease.
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:35:52
Luke's opinion is one that comes from vast technical knowledge of the Bitcoin blockchain. 
we need more exposure on this topic. We can't let the blockchain become so bloated nobody except a few centralised companies can use it. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:26:21
Maybe eventually when most of the tx load is on L2 we can reduce to 130kb, until then I think a temp 500kb block size will be adequate.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:42:21
You wanna keep a record of every microTX? Didn't think so...
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:06:44
Haha rolling node pruning with optional cap isn't a new idea, as much as I'd love to take credit. 
I honestly think a decentralized network of nodes storing various amount of chain data with checkpoints to cross audit the chains. Although block headers and hashes should be enough without checkpoints. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:13:00
We shouldn't advocate censoring transactions unless they can't afford the fee.
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:47:24
I've always thought of checkpointing and option node pruning would be beneficial.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:43:37
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:03:48
Reducing block size should be our top priority.
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:44:06
For the next year, yes. 
can you link this guy the maths please.
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:51:14
Could be done with a clean soft fork. Would help alleviate the storage and processing stress we put on nodes, especially when syncing initially. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:48:49
Leave this sub if you can't understand the basics.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:43:10
I've always thought that what you described would be a deterrent, but it appears attempted 51% attacks have actually happened. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:56:18
Reduce it to 300kb, let the bloat die off and spam transactions dropped from the mempool, then we can increase the blocksize when the hardware can scale properly.
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:18:15
Yes we need to reduce the blocksize now to reduce the impact of an already bloated chain. 
Who cares if the mempool is huge when it's 90% spam or low fee tx. Drop the low fee transactions from the mempool altogether and clear up the spam causing a perceived clog in the mempool
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:49:39
Fake news.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:29:27
Uhhh read the white paper....
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:55:52
Bootstrapping + 500kb blocks would increase decentralization
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:42:14
What is a 10% attack?
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:38:43
I didn't remove it, it's still there. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:04:29
Luke dashjr agrees
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:34:21
YESS!! This is what Bitcoin needs.
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:40:10
Not obselete technology, but you're on the right track. We should be decreasing the barrier of entry for nodes. If I want to run a node on my rpi1 then I should be able to.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:12:14
Yeah I think we should be capping it at 500kb for normal tx and 1mb for segwit.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:10:06
500kb blocks until we can figure out a better scaling solution. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:27:35
We need to lower the blocksize if anything
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:30:00
Blocksize will always be better the lower it is
