Self fulfilling prophecies?

Too bad I cant get my BTC to an exchange 
@_date: 2018-10-17 05:08:28
I have a only a small portion of portfolio in btc for this reason. I don't want to support a crypto that doesn't have a plan to mitigate environmental impact. Difficultly doesn't have a cap so neither does energy usage. And it is *puposfully* security by resource usage. Logic leads me to believe that miners who reduce energy costs will increase their hash power proportionally to increase profits. At best energy usage is a wash, at worst those profits get reinvested and a mining operation can now stomach higher energy usage than before they adopted strategies to minimize it. It's probably a dumb move financially, but averting climate disaster is more valuable to me. 
Glad to hear some miners are conscious of this, but bc China is the majority of mining, and coal is still in large use there, I'm mostly out for now. :'(
Edit: some more thoughts

Can someone convince me it is possible to support POW cryptos and averting climate change due to excessive resource usage and carbon emissions? Preferably in the context of today's situation and 5-10 years out.

If you are diversified between BTC and ammunition, you can't go wrong!

Better to have a community that can mostly agree on a hard fork

... 5.87% fee ...

People wonder why this is a bubble.... this is crypto 101. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:47:26
Haha. That still doesn't mean it's a reasonable fee. If it were reasonable LN wouldn't be such an an exciting improvement. You're argument is "because this is the best this system can offer, it is the best." Which discounts the reality that better schemes exist. Shoot even XRP would probably be better for this txn.

Okay, make thousands of sub-dollar txns for 6% fee and tell us all again how reasonable it is. We'll use another chain for them.

"Everyone cheats a little bit"
Seriously, it could have been as simple as his brother giving an unsolicited warning to his *family*, and C Lee being the good guy passing it along.
Pretty sure my family wouldn't think twice about looking out for each other... I hope...
