@_date: 2015-06-08 16:39:36
Ha, my bad, I thought this was about the venue of the event, that is not an actual store. It was an image from a Blog by Aaron Koenig, that I had borrowed with his permission.

"Nishith Desai Associates, one among a handful of law firms in India trying to develop a way to present the Bitcoin framework effectively so that its legitimacy comes from the fact that it is decentralized, rather than regulated."
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:32:43
Its a large Business Park, with several entities holding offices in the space. We were at the Nishith Desai Associates office for this event/ gathering.
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:59:03
nope, it was a very small gathering. There were more people curious about Bitcoin that Bitcoiners itself.
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:19:43
It was held at maker maxity BKC, Mumbai - 
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:08:06
Was at this event. Awesome speech. Set a benchmark for India in terms of the explanation of Bitcoin with the context of culture &amp; usage.
@_date: 2014-04-23 06:19:00
I have also posted a link with their statement. So cannot understand how this is with improper study or to be on 'the wall'.
@_date: 2014-07-15 06:33:26
Almost everyone that I have spoken to over the past few years across India, have all had different uses for Bitcoin. This is amazing, as we can use it in sooo many different ways across India. Let us not forget that even domestic money transfer is a nightmate out here.

TBH, btcxindia is run by a pretty cool guy and I do wish him all the best. There need to be many more exchanges as well, else the opportunity for arbitrage will be lost.
With India's size, localized or more exchanges will be a far more powerful utility than one or two big players across the country!
@_date: 2014-04-23 05:47:24
This was what was told to us. There were also news reports that they had pulled down and were waiting for RBI clarification
&lt;quote&gt;Virtual currency sites like MadOverCoins, have not started trading activities yet, according to the site's spokesperson Natasha Ambrose. "We are in talks with the income-tax officials in Bangalore, explaining the tax implications of Bitcoin trade in India," said Natasha, whose site has products, mainly for NRIs, who wish to order them in exchange for bitcoins. "We are merely educating people on how they can exchange their bitcoins for services," said Natasha, whose site has products from coconut water to a Bullet Enfield.&lt;/quote&gt;

Will relook at that. I guess it needs to be reworded. The creative team focussed more towards getting an intro video in place. We aim to do atleast 1 video each month in English and Hindi. As this was our first, we did try to keep it as simple as possible. Did want to convey that Crypto is the tool that removes boundaries, but it does seem a bit off.
@_date: 2014-07-16 05:23:34
We would be taking on a large build. Technically and Visually appealing.. And yeah, we have the energy to be Indias hottest Bitcoin Startup and that is our goal for now. We do wish to enable people across India and have a proper roadmap on how to put that into effect. Am hoping to live up to your expectations :)

The Coinsecure team has been acquired by a Delhi based industrialist, Mohit Kalra who joins as CEO &amp; Founder and sets forward to chart out its next generation offerings for the Bitcoin ecosystem in India.
The terms of the deal remain closed, however most of the terms are to facilitate the growth of Bitcoin across India rather than a monetory dealing. There will be a restructure and relocation of the business centers and we will start with 2 centers in India.
Our head office will be based out of Delhi and house the accounts, legal, management &amp; advisory teams. The development center will be in Bangalore led by Benson Samuel who will be joining as the CTO &amp; Founder. Jincy Samuel will join in as COO &amp; Center head for the Bangalore facility. Mridul Sawhney joins us as the Creative Head. Pankaj Kumar, well known across the bitcointalk forums as escrow.ms joins us from Delhi, to manage operations  and co-ordinate with both teams.
Coinsecure aims to tackle several challenges that have supressed the progress of growth within the Indian ecosystem. We aim to design a wide range of software and hardware that caters to every Bitcoiner’s need.
We will start by launching a block explorer for India in the next few weeks. And many more explosive builds to follow.
We have a young and energetic team of Developers, Animators, Graphics Designers, Brand Managers and Startup Champions.
We also have some of the best Security researchers in the industry working with us on various aspects of the build. Getting the best, helps us optimize the speed without compromising on security. We will also participate actively in bug bounty programmes.
All this technology is backed by a rock solid team of Lawyers, Accountants, Lobbyists and Management veterans.
Our goal is to educate, simplify and enable. With this moto, we will be enabling a wide range of merchants, developers, stakeholders and other parts of the ecosystem who need easy access to Bitcoin in India.
Sign up for updates and stay posted on our launch page at coinsecure.in.

I work with  We are in India as well and have heard nothing from any authorities. We do have banking partnerships and have confirmed with them that there is no problem. The statement of 'We have investigated the possibility to operate through other banks, but it seems this is a general policy in India as of today.' is quite misleading and seems to have been thrown around loosely.
@_date: 2014-07-15 19:13:40
No, We brought an investor onboard, restructured the company and finally get down to building up our prototypes and plans. This move enables the development team to focus on development and the management team to focus on some of the toughest financial regulations in the world.

We would be doing a lot more than the block explorer. I believe that the size, demographic and population of India, allows for more than one Exchange/ Other builds.

I attempted to write on what was proposed by Jon Matonis, that Bitcoin should have the facet of being anonymous or not. 
By maintaining it in a regulated environment, we could see a surge of usage by building a few layers of security on top of it as well. And the anonymous usage can never be stopped anyway,
@_date: 2012-09-23 06:25:31
Also a bank that offers to protect its customers digital money through mining power of its network. Branches to make P2P money come into the forefront of discussion.

Also unocoin.com is an article aggregation site on Bitcoin.

@_date: 2012-09-23 07:43:51
I dont think that you are the right audience for this. We are at a stage of this technology to form ideas and look at different ways of getting mass adoption. Atleast my efforts so far have got a lot of people in India talking about Bitcoin and learning more for themselves. Not just from what i write, but several more detailed resources as well. Any financial or non physical  trade based economy has to arise from trust. Since bitcoin lacks that, escrow firms will always be needed. in legacy banking, banks provide that to us today already. Bitcoin just adds a new currency that has a rock solid base, but still needs an escrow to operate most of its mass trade.
@_date: 2012-09-23 06:17:29
Imagine a digital security firm that offers to protect companies from getting hacked, by using the combined mining power of their network. Dont you think that will have much value? Look at it as Bitcoin Technology rather than Bitcoin money.
@_date: 2012-10-12 14:06:06
Am not trying convince anyone.. Just my views..
@_date: 2012-09-23 15:23:59
I do not support a central authority Julian, just a short theory write up. I do think that different models need to be presented for people to choose from. Bitcoin seems to be the best for now, but we don't know if there is something that is around the corner which is far more robust.
@_date: 2012-11-30 12:48:06
Hmm.. Odd reaction from Jeff. 
@_date: 2012-09-23 05:56:43
Depends on who's purpose it is republitard. It is open source technology. Why restrict it only to Bitcoin? Why not involve banks, hi-tech security companies and others into the range of where bitcoin technology can reach. Imagine a digital security firm that offers to protect companies from getting hacked, by using the combined mining power of their network.
@_date: 2012-09-23 04:25:00
But in order for its popularity to spread, people need to be given options. These are the ones for people who do not have a need for anonymous transactions and the ones who still need the security blanket that a centralized currency can offer.

Can an NGO based in India receive donations in Bitcoin?
This is an interesting question because it would be perfectly legal for a regular citizen to receive Bitcoins from abroad as a gift or donation, etc. However if the entity receiving such Bitcoins is an NGO then there would be the added layer of regulation from the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act, 2010 (“FCRA”) which regulates all foreign contributions received by NGOs. Section 2(1)(h) of the FCRA defines foreign contribution to include the receipt of any article from a foreign source. This means that even if an NGO based in India receives contribution from a foreign source in Bitcoins, such a transaction would fall within the regulatory ambit of the FCRA and any such a transaction would have to be reported to the Ministry of Home Affairs in Form FC – 7 under Rule 17(3) of the Rules under the FCRA.

My Views:
1.    What is the balanced way to exit  the current system? Timing ? How much ? 
There cannot be a balance with this exit. The system has to report in to Bitcoin/ Cryptos or fall. Could be 3-4 years maximum for an effected change. Late adopters will have to pay a price - Some may face up to 80%+ devaluation of current wealth.
2.    What is the impact analysis ? (law / regulatory reporting).
None. Bitcoin's distributed nature allows for drop down reporting, but does not allow for regulation unless based out of a Trusted service provider.
3.    Eco System acceptance ?
That is inevitable. Banks have screwed themselves through inflation. If the media bangs in Bitcoin for the next year, it is enough for a healthy economy to fall into place.
4.    What should be the pace ? How long ?
Pace is determined by the amount of noise that can be created. 1yr - 3 yrs.
5.    What about the interim ?
Interims have already been created with newer payment technologies that are not affiliated to the bank. We need to watch for these. We are already quite comfortable with online payments.

India works in a slightly different manner. Everything to do with finance and trade is regulated. In fact Sandalwood trees are owned by the government. It is illegal to grow one in your premises without informing the government. This is one example of the regulations here.
It is not possible to show Bitcoin as illegal in its own right, the main problems arise from where it is used.
