I don't think so. It's the nature of distributed blockchains. It could get faster though.

The bitcoin network. Rare long confirmation times are inherent in the system, but as things improve they should still get shorter and rarer.
@_date: 2015-06-10 19:21:33
For a full confirmation, yes, but it can be verified to a high probability before that anyways. The standard is 6 verifications IIRC. That's good enough for small transactions, but if you *need* to be sure once in a while you can wait for it to be mined. When you make a transaction you sign it with your secret code; just because it hasn't been mined yet doesn't mean it can't be verified cryptographically.
So there is a spectrum you can choose between convenience and absolute surety, but as computers and internet connections get faster verification and propagation through the network will be faster, even if the block time stays the same.

That was because it was wrongly implemented. It can be correctly implemented however, without the problem.
@_date: 2016-06-01 19:52:54
Yes, there are some that view BTC as an investment, but the goal of the project and its end result is to have a currency which is not centrally maintained and whose "printing" is regular and predictable. This is viewed as paramount and the reward to "idle" earlier users is a real and necessary, but secondary consequence. The usury class involved in maintaining the dollar is of a much larger magnitude because it is done centrally involving and promoting corruption, at least that's the assumption, and so Bitcoin is preferable although not ideally perfect.
I won't exactly disagree with what you are saying, but what you mentioned are consequences of implementation, not the desired philosophical ends which maintain the balance between bad and good consequences.
The fact that it's increased usage increases its relative value is transitory, as a currency can't be entirely delinked from being a commodity. Those who invest value into the currency enable its security, usage and proliferation. Thus they are rewarded if it further increases in utility and punished if it does not. The ability for the miners to maintain a secure and decentralized network is a result of this increased value. The value is derived primarily from the safety from being devalued, and people inevitably ride the hype train.
The implementation of a decentralized currency that is initially evenly distributed is associated with its own problems including corruption and fraud, and is thus entirely unfeasible. Thus, the ends justify the means, and people would be smart to be exposed to BTC regardless of their philosophical views of an ideal currency.
You can view it as "visionaries being rewarded" for their early use, but the actual purpose of Bitcoin is different from that but inseparable as a reality of the implementation.


Is the printed money not used immediately to purchase new debt first? Only then does it get to the Treasury, and *then* used to pay off other debt. And does the repayment of this debt remove it from circulation? What I'm getting at is that the printed money stays in circulation and is never destroyed, and that it is located outside of the US. If this is incorrect, then that's news to me.
When the Treasuries purchased with the printed money can't be paid off, more must be created, hence the need for monetary inflation following economic collapses, else there would be either a liquidity crisis or a large-scale default. Exponential growth of the nominal currency and the total goods can match and thus neutralize price inflation, but the fact that the "market" involving the dollar is not free and involves much coercion in forcing entities to purchase treasuries indicates that it only appears that these things perfectly match. If that balance is broken it will result in a new equilibrium which may correspond with a confidence change thus perpetuating things further.
@_date: 2016-06-20 20:44:17
So if the loop requires currency to do and thus has a monetary pressure to avoid them, what's the big problem?
@_date: 2016-06-01 17:31:31
The two concepts are often synonymous in certain situations. When one talks about local economies, then monetary inflation correlates to price inflation due to supply and demand. Newly printed money is used to buy a product that otherwise would not have been bought. This represents higher demand, and because the product has been bought, there is lower supply of it, hence the price inflation.
But take for instance however the actions of the US. The US prints money (monetary inflation), and then gives it to other countries to use, but *only within their country*. The money supply has increased, but prices do not, because the local supply within the US did not change, it stayed in that country. Thus, in simple situations they are quite related, though price inflation does lag behind monetary inflation, but in larger systems they are certainly not directly correlated. These convoluted situations did not arise back with Smith, at least I'd guess.
This difference is the reason why people fear that in a situation where there is less demand for dollars that it will cause price inflation, because the excess monetary inflation in other countries will be used to buy products from the US, causing their value to rise, meaning that buying these products could be an investment if they are sold later, thus funneling the dollars back to the US and causing hyperinflation.
The extreme monetary inflation of the past decade has not translated to price inflation because of the low velocity of money (it's not used to buy many goods), and the printed money does not return to the US.
But the printed money isn't just given away, it's used to buy bonds first, and then go to the treasury to be distributed. So, it's all very convoluted and so Smith's ideas don't apply to this situation directly.

Ah, that is a good point. I didn't account for whether miners immediately sell their rewards or not. I'll have to think about this more.

The causal relation between them is obvious. More supply of currency means its value goes down because people are more frivolous with it.

@_date: 2017-01-01 18:49:27
While this may be true from one contrived and limited perspective, it isn't very useful to think this way, because buying btc is similar to simply not selling it. So, in the supply and demand paradigm, I think you may be neglecting the fact that if people holding btc don't sell it, that reduces supply, and sends the price up, given invariant demand. Market cap doesn't mean the equivalent value which has been "put into" the currency in terms of nominal values of only purchases, as it can change much faster that the amount spent in new purchases, because the actual amount available to buy is actually very small compared to the total in existence.
You can say that people not selling are actually "buying" btc with their potential value, but saying that doesn't really explain the situation fully within the more "complete" paradigm of demand *and* supply.
@_date: 2016-06-01 16:39:00
Monetary inflation vs price inflation. Monetary inflation came first and often causes the other, and so they were conflated by Keynesians.

@_date: 2015-07-21 23:12:11
They're different. Bitcoin does monetary transactions, can send short messages and sign them. Ethereum has a contract system that can run programs and verify them decentrally.
Another big difference is that Bitcoin is deflationary because less and less is created each year. The Ethereum currency "ether" will always be produced at the same rate IIRC. This means that BTC may be a better store of value once the two currencies settle because it will have a smaller incremental supply added to the economy. Ethereum can provide verified generalized computing and isn't necessarily meant to be monetary.
@_date: 2015-07-30 16:52:14
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:22:44
Yeah, given enough time it's similar, but there is still a difference.
Ethereum is much more customizable. It takes an incredible amount of effort to change the block size, Bitcoin won't be as versatile as Ethereum for a long time because Ethereum was made like that from the start. And with faster block times it's better for such things.
Just because Bitcoin can do similar things doesn't mean it does them anywhere near as well.

You can check out the testnet now. It doesn't have all the features yet, but the basics are functional. Right now they're testing security and stability, basic contracts work fine. There are no theoretical roadblocks, it's just a matter of time, you can't expect it to be complete overnight.

Miners choose a number of potential transactions, the previous block, and a salt and hash that. They keep hashing different combinations until the hash has a special rare property. That represents a new block in the blockchain, meaning that those transactions are verified, and the miner receives a pre-determined BTC reward as well as the transaction fees from those transactions.
These elements make up the basic dynamics and incentives for miners. They can make more BTC by including more transactions.
The longest blockchain is deemed the main one, and so when a miner sees that a new valid block has been mined, they use that as the new input for their hash, because then if they manage to mine a block, people will in turn use theirs.
This longest blockchain then represents a list of past transactions, and so the miner of a new block is able to add their own reward to the evolving ledger.

The risk has nothing to do with the protocol. It has to do with people who bought in at $1000 and want to “take a profit” once the recent price spike slows down. Then you get speculators that think it will go down further, and they sell, and then you get a correction. It happens like every single time after a price spike, just look at the historical charts. I do agree however that this won’t easily happen without some sort of cause, but trust me, some people are looking for a reason to sell their btc, and not everyone is a hodler.

@_date: 2017-10-21 21:51:52
Indeed, though I don’t know why it has to go down to go up... I think it’s more of a case of a self-fulfilling prophesy. If people weren’t so logical it could just keep going up without a drop off, but these patterns are just so symmetrical that it seems likely the fractal will continue unless something fundamentally changes. As Bitcoin’s exposure rises, there does become less upside, but its exposure isn’t “too big”. We are definitely in uncharted territory now, though I would still expect a future correction down and again a shot up next year.
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:14:40
I'm just saying, that if the pattern which has repeated at least 4 times continues, BTC is due for a correction soon. Not saying it won't go back up after even higher.
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:06:45
Going down!!
@_date: 2015-09-25 20:24:42
No way. People use a currency for different reasons. Affter the price goes up, people use Bitcoin. It's been stable for a while, so why not just use Dollars? Wait till Bitcoin goes up again and you'll see people use it again. Why use it now if you think the price is going to go up? Why not keep them and wait?
But now with its usage going down, that puts less downward pressure on the price. When you buy a product with bitcoin, it often is immediately sold on an exchange for dollars, and then those dollars are sent to the seller. So, with this not happening as frequently, there is less supply in the exchanges, so, that's positive for the price in itself.

@_date: 2016-05-29 00:05:38
Not at all. It just means that it will break out of it's limited channel. Trading algorithms of some traders may keep it within certain constraints influenced by past trends, and many algorithms (or trading psychology) may agree and create a self-fulfilling prophesy. So now, there are broken trend channels and everything is open game, so people won't sell when it gets to a high mark because nobody knows how high it will go.
The price recently had a cap at around 500 or so, and would approach it and then retreat. Same with the lower bound, which has slowly been increasing. This is the wedge. The upper and lower bounds have crossed and so it breaks out of them and starts a new cycle. This is all just trading psychology though, not math, so nothing at all is sure.
@_date: 2016-05-29 00:16:45
Just because it breaks out of a channel doesn't mean it can't go down.All I'm saying is the suppression of volatility is followed by high volatility.

Ethereum was never supposed to be a reliable store of value to be honest. It's even purposefully not as deflationary as BTC. Most Ethereum supporters would say to store long-term value in BTC.
Transfer BTC to ether when using an Ethereum contract. Otherwise, you can speculate on value, but using it as an intermediary doesn't mean that value is necessarily important.
In the future, mining rewards will also come from computation when the decentralized computer needs to perform calculations. Or even if the program stores a file, then that person that stores the file can be paid for it, in a more objective value than ether.
So, what I'm saying is that Ethereum isn't a currency, but it has one to enable certain things. The currency ether should be used on a short-term basis or speculation, and certainly not long-term.


I don't believe this is true. The Ethereum network can use BTC as a currency for contracts to use, and simply use ether as an intermediate.

If you study free market economics, like Austrian Economics, you soon find that knowing things like this is impossible because there are so many factors. What we know is that the price acts as a mechanism to allow for efficient distribution, based on supply and demand.
