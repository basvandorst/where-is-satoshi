Wait, he does realize that the fellow in his Satoshi painting is not the creator of Bitcoin. Just happens to have the same name..?

GMOInternet for the win, funny they just released a miner much better than buttmains.

Bitcoin reached 22k without all that shit so fuck them? 
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:31:22
Bitcoin didn’t reach 22k CAD with ETF or talk about it and big investors coming into play... people have lost the point. Hodl and it will sort itself out fuck the US thinking they run shit.  Trump knows the last thing about trade.. look who’s in charge of deciding again the American people.. what a joke

Those damn numbers increasing and the amount they make per month, I only dream of this :(
Edit: wait how many miners do they have going like 50 100? One won’t do that

Probably another way to drain the market and make all the weak hands sell so big corps and governments can buy in low. They’re worried about market manipulation.. but this is what they’re doing.. they’re stocking up. It made itself here without them

 Buy eth and put it into cardano or stellar lumens. You can get a decent amount and just keep stocking up from there. Obviously I’m shilling these coins as I hodl. Every little bit will be worth it in the end.

 I sure am already bought the dip twice haha.. Don’t see why people wouldn’t, nothings changed. Technology and adoption is still moving forward. Am I missing something? 
@_date: 2018-06-01 20:59:02
Love how something like this is posted every single week lol...

I don’t understand what ads an these posts that keep coming up.. they have not stopped. Why do people keep posting this.. They have not gone away.

Sorry, I don’t get where you get your info from.. lots of adoption is still happening all over. Walmart, Amazon, Amex, google, shitbook, Canadian government, nasa,... the list goes on with implementation of blockchain technology, DPL is clearly on the move still.. sure maybe not small merchant adoption but that’s slowly happening.. even though the techs been around since 2009 this is still very early.

This dude is clueless, there’s a few alt coins that have proven to have use cases... how are they worthless.. lol
