It's money set aside to help you live on when Social Security is crap and you're 59+ and want to enjoy life rather than working day after day until you die. Roth IRA is after tax so your original investment plus all returns can be withdrawn tax free. Traditional IRA is good if you want a tax break today. Then you will pay taxes when you pull the money out later in life when you're likely to be in a lower tax bracket. Fund a Roth IRA year after year and you will be better off than rolling the dice on a virtual currency.

I agree. I suspect they are hoping BTC Cash withers away so they are  making everyone wait 5 months just in case it does. I started with Coinbase for the general simplicity as a newbe. Now I'm regretting that decision.

Unfortunately, a lot of people are using virtual currency as their primary investment, which in the long run, will probably be a big mistake. The stock market is not perfect but it's been around a lot longer than cryptocurrencies.

Ironically, Bitcoin is used by more terrorists worldwide than any other currency.

Why do you think you need to announce it to everyone? We don't care.

Donate to a charity and actually do something good in this world. Greenpeace accepts Bitcoin donations

None of the above. Open up a Roth IRA.

It's a scam. But it you want to give away your Bitcoin to people on the internet, go right ahead.
