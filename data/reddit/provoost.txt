The site makes money from ads, possibly more so than from BCash pumps. To sell ads you need eyeballs. The way to attract eyeballs on a nice domain name like that is to generate lots and lots of content, cheaply. So most likely the author just didn't know the difference between micro-bitcoin and milli-bitcoin, which itself is an argument in favor of using bits.

Well, at least is consistent in their attitude towards SSL and made sure their blog doesn't require it. In fact  even throws an invalid certificate error. :-)
Their AML/KYC claim seems unsubstantiated. As others have pointed out here, if you visit a website to get a payment address, that website can already spy on you as much as it wants (I don't know if BitPay uses browser fingerprinting, but that's probably worth investigating).
Now, one could imagine a scenario where the web shop is on your laptop and you use your mobile wallet to pay. In that case there is something to be said for that wallet to not have to needlessly ping some server. I would imagine that's especially important if said wallet connects to the Bitcoin P2P network over Tor network, but then doxxes itself through some unsafe implemention of BIP-70. But I'm not buying the conspiracy that that's why BitPay wants this.
That said, I don't really understand BitPay's rationale for forcing people to use BIP-70.
The SSL feature of BIP-70 doesn't seem useful at all when their website (which shows the payment address) can just use certificate pinning and such to ensure the user their DNS hasn't been hijacked. If their servers were to be be hacked, then the hacker can just change the address and sign the payment request.
The BitPay blog post makes it seem like this has everything todo with fees, but that doesn't make any sense to me either, at least studying the protocol today. There's no fee field in BIP-70 or in BIP-21:

They use rather different approaches, which is probably a good thing this early on. It also helps that all transactions ultimately are validated by full nodes and that there's less global consistency to worry about than with Bitcoin. When a you try to make a transactions and your fellow peers don't do what you expect them to do, your node can just close the channel, and a partioned Lightning network isn't the end of the world.
LND, and the desktop app built on top of it, take advantage of the proposed [neutrino lightweight wallet protocol]( This means you can use without your own full node. Probably the easiest to start out with to help testing for that reason.
Downside is that if you do want to run your own full node with lnd, you have to use an experimental [branch of btcd]( This innovation is useful even outside the scope of lightning, so worth helping out testing as well. Hopefully someone will implement it for Bitcoin Core though; it's taking me almost two weeks to sync my btcd node because it hasn't had the same performance improvements. There is a work in progress PR that connects to bitcoin core.
Eclair connects to your own full node. I found it fairly easy to setup, although the README could be better (again, anyone can help out with that, as README's get better when people keep asking the same questions).

There's big difference between using something like the Neutrino protocol, BIP-37 SPV or directly communicating over RPC, the latter being impractical for mobile. There's also differences in the dependencies and framework they use (which need screening, and might have their own security trade-offs).
I suspect one approach will win out, at which point you get the benefit you describe of having as many eyeballs on per line of code as possible.

There's two kinds of silent majorities: aware or oblivious. If most users have no idea what's going on, it will be interesting to see what happens as they find out.
The first thing they'll notice is all sorts of services, even wallets, going offline. Then they might notice some merchants not accepting their payment, and those merchants send them instructions of varying quality. Then they notice confusion around pricing. And they hear stories about redeeming 1x / 2x, free money(!) and wonder which of those two they have and how to get the other one. All this confusion makes people send emails, in many languages, to support staff of all sorts of companies, which will be completely overwhelmed. They'll most likely get canned responses, links to FAQ's, telling users to contact the other company instead, etc, but after a days some tickets start getting escalated higher up the food chain.
Initially I suspect most people will just wait and see. It could take days for actionable information to trickle through to enough of this silent majority. But as this goes on, more and more of this silent majority start deciding which side they prefer, which might lead to a flip in majority hash power. That creates a conundrum for those companies that said they'll follow the majority. Those companies may have decided the winner based on the first few hours, because they were under tremendous pressure to resume operations.
Now all of a sudden people will see a different transaction history and probably a vastly different price. Those people start asking support staff what on earth just happened to their transaction history.
And that's ignoring the [possibility]( of a large reorg on either side wreaking havoc on replay protection.
I expect this to become the greatest mess in the history of Bitcoin. Hopefully I'm wrong.

I thought about this too and this may be a real issue for many. However if only a few can successfully deal with these issues, word will spread.
Shipping: the foreign customer can make and pay for a Fed-Ex order; this would be interesting for more expensive items and presumably the buyer gets a discount for the hassle.
Domestic suppliers: if they are desperate enough to move inventory, they will probably at least consider accepting bitcoin from their loyal customers, even if only as collateral. 
Foreign suppliers: it might be possible to pay them in fiat by exchanging bitcoin to fiat on a foreign operated exchange. I'm not sure if any exchanges currently support "please do a SEPA transfer to this bank account" as a feature and there might be some KYC objections to that. But it would get them around the capital controls.
Paying staff: they might have to use Bitcoin to import commodities like cigarettes (or even gold) which they can then use to pay staff who then use it as barter to buy food and other necessities beyond the €60 a day ATM limit (giving them an immense advantage over others).

I found an even more [dramatic difference]( from 7 hours down to 2:20 on an EC2  t2.xlarge.
That's partially an artifact of my experimental setup: when I did the v0.14.2 measurement in early July it had to perform several months worth of signature verification work beyond the last [assumed-valid]( block. Because v0.15.0rc3 has a more recent assumed-valid block, it didn't have to validate any signatures to sync to the same early July block.
A more fair basis for comparison is probably to use an assumed-valid block from six months ago. It would be nice if future clients had a trustable way to get a more up to date assumed-valid block.

This is a problem for BU and BCH as well, at least in my opinion. They're quite far behind Core's upstream. It's a very tedious project for them to merge stuff, because they have too many incompatible changes. A simple code style change can confuse git and once you start to manually merge stuff, you really need to know what you're doing.
 
SegWit2x could avoid this through relentless focus and only maintaining the smallest possible patch on top of Core. This is one reason why I think the effort is more credible than earlier hard fork attempts. However even this more modest approach seems to be non-trivial; for some reason the current [work in progress diff]( is massive. If they can't reduce that to +- 200 lines, that's a problem.
If they lose focus and start adding their own features, as was casually suggested in [this update]( they would permanently lose the ability to track upstream.
If Core decides to [abandon]( the project, there's nothing to rebase on and if they can't attract enough developers eventually things will start to degrade.
@_date: 2017-09-30 12:13:01
As far as I understand, no. Miners need to sell their coins so they should mine whatever is the most profitable. If you're willing to take a short term loss for what you believe is a long term gain, I think it's more effective to just buy on your favorite side of the fork and sell on the other side. There's not really any infrastructure for that at the moment, but if past forks are any indication there will be soon enough.
Even if hash power is cripplingly low, you should still be able to buy and sell using something like futures, assuming someone offers that service. This would then incentive existing miners to switch some hash power over to the side you bought on.

Probably [Child Pays For Parent]( *(update 17:26 CET: actually no, this wasn't CPFP. There exists at least one transaction around that time that matches the description and wasn't significantly subsidized by a child transaction - I'm intentionally vague here to respect his privacy).*
Timing suggests it was this tx:  (Update 16:29 CET: it was a different transaction, because I confused Satoshi per byte with the total fee)
One output of that transaction was spent using another 135 satoshi / byte transaction in the same block, one output of which in turn was spent using 135 satoshi / byte in the same block. This makes an average of roughly 2/3 * 135 = 90 sat / byte, which would indeed confirm in about 10 blocks.
His fee was less than the default 1.2 sat / byte minimum relay fee (update 17:26 CET: no, it's 1 sat/byte).
I sent a 1.2 sat / byte transaction on August 1 which confirmed the next block, but I also sent a 1 sat / byte transaction that remained stuck.
His node might be connected to nodes with a lower minimum relay fee, but it begs the question why any miner would lower the default. I assume it got relayed because the child transactions did pay a fee.
1.0 satoshi per byte transactions happen a couple of times per month: 
There's actually a lot more transactions that pay zero fees:
Even if it's not CPFP, it's possible to pay miners off-chain for inclusion and miner software could have bugs. Occam's razor suggests that is more likely than a spam attack to promote big blocks.
Evidence that would persuade me otherwise would be leaked emails between conspirators that include details as to who pays for what, how transactions are withheld from non-participating miners, and such practical issues.

I ran 0.14 again with the more recent assumed valid block, so it now it looks more similar to what you found.
I also managed to sync v0.5 all the way to the end of 2013, which took 62 hours. It might have gone faster if I'd run a script to kill it every time it got stuck and I did lose my patience and manually restarted it as it kept grinding to a halt during the last few weeks worth of blocks. v0.8 did it in just 3.5 hours. v0.15 in about 50 minutes.

The amount of work depends on the complexity of the product that needs to be upgraded, and the state of its dependencies, and could easily be weeks. In theory participants could have had code and UI ready to go when SegWit activated, as could the Core wallet. That would have resulted in a much higher percentage at the start.
Presumably there were trade-offs for why that wasn't the case, but it's fair to say the participants had significant control over how fast SegWit would be rolled out. That makes the slow adoption of SegWit not a very convincing argument for an immediate hard-fork. This argument was more reasonable back in early 2016 when SegWit only existed on paper.
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:37:37
In this case I'm referring to the short notice on the final choice of replay protection mechanism. Many core developers already considered six months notice hard fork itself to be too little, and this is &gt;10x less time.
I haven't studied that proposal in detail yet. I'd be worried about phishing, with tutorials "explaining" how to use that address, while replacing it with something similar. Maybe they thought about that.
Update: I left a [comment]( just in case.
@_date: 2017-09-28 09:43:59
1,000,000 non-witness bytes x 1 sat / byte min relay fee = 0.01 BTC = $40 is indeed quite affordable, given the net worth of _some_ of the more vocal folks. With a sufficiently long unlock time on the 1x chain a spam attack would be quite expensive too. Just in case you could use RBF and a series of time-locked transactions with escalating fees, as you mentioned in the SF talk.
Although I'm in favor of such skin in the game, giving these people a personal financial stake in the 2x outcome is probably not what you want at this point. It might also be a problematic conflict of interest if they run a company. That said, it would have added significant weight to the SegWit2x agreement if it came with a $100 million locked up in this fashion. And so would any counter arguments (though I prefer technical arguments).

They are likely adding opt-in protection, but no opt-out replay protection and certainly no mandatory replay protection. Here's my attempt of making sense of it: 
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:19:35
Do you have any thoughts on what those simple changes could be? For example, I could imagine a fund just holding on to both sides of any fork and settle the matter later through some (voting?) process.
But that makes it difficult for the fund to buy new coins after the fork; which side do you buy, what if there's very little liquidity on one side? Without good good replay protection it's also hard for a fund to sell.
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:36:20
Changing the assume valid point for the measurement makes sense.
Are there any plans to, when a wallet receives funds, retroactively verify related signatures from before the assumed-valid point? I think it would take a pretty big conspiracy for that to make rational sense, but it might make people feel better.
@_date: 2017-09-28 10:16:47

@_date: 2017-09-30 12:07:58
They are still working out the details, see Github issues [ [ and a few others. There's quite a few trade-offs to consider, such as chain bloat, the possibility that one chain doesn't have enough hash power for some time (so you want a mechanism for both chains), complexity of changing wallets, not breaking SPV wallets (and defining what "breaking" means),  complexity of changing consensus code and willingness of core devs to review that, long term technical debt, etc. With six weeks to go this seems a little, well, risky.
@_date: 2017-09-28 04:35:02
Such a large transaction would be rather expensive,might not confirm in time and would never confirm is the fork doesn’t happen. The cost problem could be solved by doing this trade with many interested parties though.

With earlier attempts I'm referring to Bitcoin Classic, XT and BU. The mistake these projects, especially BU, made was to to do too much extra stuff, creating a long term maintenance nightmare and all sorts of DDOS risk, as we've seen. SegWit2x avoided that, even by not merging replay protection that they're not confident enough about.
Garzik has also been relatively (!) mature in response to criticism, at least until he started defaming Core with these accusations of instability. Remember that the BU lead dev did a tit-for-tat revenge by prematurely disclosing what he believed to be critical vulnerabilities in Core. These were debunked but that doesn't change the childish nature of that behavior.
I agree with you that in order to get to the next level they need to do what you just described. They have the budget for this and some companies (let alone governmsnts if they take an interest) are sufficiently long term oriented to pull this off. This is why my estimate was 1 year (maybe 5-10 is more realistic). They just need to actually do what  conspiracy theorists believe Blockstream is doing.
I also agree that sufficiently well informed developers will agree with Core more often than not, possibly even join them, but don't underestimate a sufficiently determined opponent with infinite resources. CIA spies probably spend years gaining trust...
Of course they may not actually do this and instead try the same old failed tactics again, and probably fail for the same reasons.

My [naive interpretation]( is that for the purpose of this case it doesn't really matter if Bitcoin is money or a good. The only thing this case cares about is whether the bankruptcy procedures can get started. For that, it needs to be established that someone stopped paying and "paying" can be interpreted more broadly than just money. Whether Bitcoin is money or potatoes: someone stopped paying.
The judge seems to go for the potatoes interpretation, but if it doesn't matter for the end result it might not be relevant as precedent either. For those bankruptcy procedures themselves the distinction might be relevant, but that would be separate case and a problem for the next judge. Lawyers might disagree....

I was talking about Github specifically. I agree Slack is more problematic. It's a terrible tool for decision making and the lack of public logs means you can't really track what happened.
IRC shouldn't be used for decisions either. You should never assume all stakeholders are online at the same time, let alone watching every channel all the time just in case someone wants to make some decision there and then. IRC is a good place to ask questions, and brainstorm issues, but ultimately this information should end up on Github or a mailinglist, so other developers can weigh in over the next few days (or weeks / months for that matter).

To be clear: I don't believe he is Satoshi.
I agree with you that he needs to provide a digital signature, but there is more nuance in the real world compared to the Arthurian story. 
The most important nuance is that he could have lost the keys or (if he does sign) he could have stolen the keys.
If he claimed that he lost the keys, I might buy that. In that case all the other evidence has to add up (tone of voice, expertise, details of his whereabouts, op-sec, etc). Instead he initially provided fake evidence, followed by a bunch of emo nonsense. And the other evidence totally doesn't add up and even contradicts it.
There are however plenty of people who are giving him the benefit of the doubt. They understand that there is more nuance to the real world than just the cryptographic key, but they are nowhere near skeptical enough. Some of these people can be persuaded with more evidence against his claims, others just need a reminder of the evidence already presented. People have successfully escaped cults, so it's not impossible

Good point about BIP66 chain split. The risk is not greater than any other upgrade*, but it's useful to point out upgrades always come with risk. Your articles are going to get really long though :-)




Correct, although astronomically unlikely. I know at least two people who will not upgrade under any circumstance :-) I think the article would be more readable if it ignored that possibility, but then you would get criticized for that too.


I don't agree with "effectively meaningless" either (didn't mean to leave that out). Just imagine what would happen if "NYA" signaling had only reached 40%; SegWit2x would have lost a lot credibility and participants might have felt betrayed and started fighting amongst themselves. There was some recent publicity on Reddit when it dipped slightly under 80% for a few hours. I think the success or failure of SegWit2x depends very much on public perception.




I agree with that, but at the same time they made concessions to avoid a BIP148 split (such as making the timeline more aggressive, changing the signaling mechanism from the original plan). They made no such concessions for the 2x hard fork part (yet). So in that sense they seem to consider a BIP148 split premature. 
 




If I understand correctly, that would be in or before the middle of a difficulty adjustment period for the BIP148 chain. If they have more than 50% hash power, there won't be a split and so they don't need to change PoW. If there is less that 50% hash power the next difficulty adjustment will on or about August 30.
So it's not "just" changing the proof of work, it would require changing the retargeting mechanism. I don't think it's wise to do that on short notice. An alternative could be for them to let go of the BIP148 fork, and fork off the main chain once more, e.g. on August 15th. I'm looking forward to your article on those efforts.
My personal stance on this is that I am skeptical of this particular effort, but there may be a future scenario where I would advocate for it. So these preparations are useful. This puts me in the confusing position of criticizing it, but also encouraging people to come up with a solid plan that might come out handy someday.

This by the way makes it very interesting to study the exact details of the SegWit2x hard fork mechanics. In particular if participating miners need to keep signaling 80%, because that would tie their hands when it comes to diverting hash power to this other battle. So far I don't believe the code enforces this, so once BIP91 is locked in they can do whatever (from a code point of view).

For BIP148 to work, miners must perceive a credible threat of not being able to sell their coinbase transactions. Right now they're seeing people installing nodes and know that these people are not taking risk.
On the other hand, if they saw a large crowd of users who stand to lose all their live savings, they will remember what Sun Tzu wrote: "When your army has crossed the border, you should burn your boats and bridges, in order to make it clear to everybody that you have no hankering after home."
The words of "BIP148 doomsayers" are irrelevant in this game, and need not be taken seriously (but they may offer valuable knowledge). The game is between those who want BIP 148 and those miners that don't.

Here's perhaps a useful way to analyze this, step by step from a miner point of view. 
1 - It's August 1 and someone mines a block signaling SegWit, and then the next block also signals SegWit, etc. This is boring scenario; no chain split.
2 -  It's August 1 and someone mines a block not signaling SegWit. UASF nodes reject this block. The next miner wishes to signal SegWit, but now has to make a choice: ignore the previous block or build on top of it. If there was a functioning market at the moment this fork activates - ideally a futures market - he could use the price to make this choice. But there isn't. So the choice is between building on top of the most proof of work on a chain that's currently considered valid by the economic majority (but some unknown risk of wipeout), or betting on a future market for BIP148 coins (no wipeout risk, but no idea what the price will be). Subsequent miners will need to make the same choice, until at some point a (futures) market does develop.
So another thing UASF supporters could do is promise to buy the coinbase reward of the first N UASF blocks for a price at least matching the non-BIP148 price, probably a bit more to offset (perceived) risk. Someone could raise funds for that through some sort UASF non-profit. Perhaps that could bridge the gap between August 1 and when exchanges have their stuff together. But if bribing miners is an option, BIP91 seems a safer bet.

It's unfortunate that I wasn't able to get those older clients to finish syncing, because it would have made for a more dramatic chart.
Perhaps it's still possible with sufficient tweaking - even without giving it a whitelist of nodes, which feels like cheating to me. But the fact that modern versions sync out of the box is part of the scaling improvements.
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:48:00
Is this even legal?


If you hold a 10 XBT short position across the fork, it will carry over and can be closed at any time in the usual way. However, *please note that you will also be responsible for a 10 BCH debit (negative balance) on your account* that must be corrected by either buying or depositing 10 BCH. Why the negative balance? Kraken sources the XBT to finance margin trading from individual lenders and we are preserving the value for these lenders that may lie in the BCH forked from their funds. This means that *traders who borrow XBT across the fork to short must also pay back the BCH that forks from this XBT*. Any account with a negative BCH balance will be placed on withdrawal lock until the balance is corrected.
Giving people people with long positions free casino chips is one thing, but how can unilaterally declare a debt denominated in BTC shall become a debt denominated in BTC _plus an additional debt denominated in BCH_? Not everyone can just liquidate on short notice. Anyway, a good reminder to be very careful with margin trading on unregulated pseudo-commodity exchanges.

Yes it would, but this is only possible after August 1 (given the problems we just discussed). This price ratio could eventually convince legacy miners to start mining on the BIP148 chain. They'd have to cut their losses, since the moment the market notices the switch in hashing power, the price for their earlier mined legacy coins will tank.
One way for the BIP148:BTC price ratio to climb is exactly what I suggested above: people betting their life savings and selling legacy-BTC en masse. I agree that this opens the door for BIP148 doomsayers to determine the outcome, as they can take the other side of these trades. 
But not before August 1. In order to convince miners from Day 1 to Signal SegWit _and_ reject non-SegWit blocks regardless of hash power, you need a credible threat. Without that, they end up on the non-BIP148 side of the fork immediately and now they have an ever growing financial incentive to fight it. Hence these pre-August 1 pledges might be useful, whereas I don't think similar pledges to buy legacy coins will have much impact (because miners perceive that as pretty much the status quo).

Orphaned blocks need to be valid, so different explorers might show different results, depending on which client they run. BIP91 enforcing nodes consider non-segwit signaling blocks invalid, regular core nodes consider them valid.

Unfortunately doing nothing does not guarentee a good outcome. This is not true in general (staying in your seat when someone shouts fire in a crowded theatre) and it's not true about running a full node and never upgrading.


This depends on their goals. Do they want to maximize monetary gains? What time horizon? Do they need to make and receive payments in the mean time?
For example it's not guaranteed that ignoring a contentious hard fork will in the long work out, especially if you don't have the option to hodl.


I could not agree more. But I would add that this problem can't be avoided. Running a full node and never upgrading is not a sinecure.

I wasn't aware of that post, interesting. I do think it confuses the soft fork itself with the process for activating it. Once SegWit is active, a majority enforces it like any other consensus rule.
I agree with this:


I think the cost of giving UASF supporters what they want was so low*, that even though they were not perceived as a serious threat, it wasn't worth fighting them either. The lower the cost, the less "truly intolerant" the minority needs to be.

I should clarify the "opt-in" bit of my sentence:
If the wallet allows the user to opt-in to following BIP148 (UASF) enforcing nodes (as opposed to following regular 0.14.2 Core nodes).
I know your stance is to follow UASF-only, and you seem genuinely all-in. But whenever I ask questions to exchanges and wallet that claim to "support" BIP148, their answer suggest they're not as committed and usually not willing to force their users to follow a minority hash-power chain.
@_date: 2017-07-04 08:02:34
Perhaps could clarify their own support.
From their Twitter:


Does this mean all their users will be forced to follow a BIP148 fork? Or is this going to be a setting, opt-in or opt-out? How will they inform their users about this? Their current [wallet source code]( has no mention of BIP148 or UASF, so will there be an update? 
What replay protection mechanism will they offer, if any? proposed some mechanisms, but I don't see those in the source.
If UASF is opt-in, how will they explain wipeout risk to those who don't opt-in?
Is the wallet going to follow both sides of the fork, so users can know if a transaction confirmed on both sides or just one (very useful for assessing wipe-out risk)?
What fee recommendation provider do they rely on? From their code (which I may have misread) it seems they're relying on [21]( If not their own, how will they recommend the right fee to use on the BIP148 chain? That chain may initially produce fewer blocks, depending on the hash power support, which impacts the fees needed to get included in a block. 
What price source will they use? That currently seems to be [BTC-E and BitFinex]( They'll need to release an update to (also) follow a BIP148 specific ticker.
Will they update their nodes with the hard-fork Luke advocates for [here](
My point is not to diss Samurai Wallet here. It's to point out that "support" of BIP148 is complicated and comes with more trade-offs than just wearing a baseball cap, running a full node and sending out some tweets. All "exchange(s), wallet provides or others business" need to answer these questions if they're serious about support.

Aside from that, copy-pasting library code is generally a bad idea. Many programmers have wasted countless hours, after figuring out which version was used, replacing such code with a link to the original library, only to find whoever copy-pasted it also made changes in the same commit, which conflict with upstream changes.
When dealing with crypto this is an order of magnitude worse. You want as many people as possible to be able to review a change.

The [original article]( is more interesting. These two sentences are telling:
 * "Bitcoin mining is difficult because it is a computationally complex task and can require up to 90 percent of a machine’s power."
 * "each miner is awarded not only the fees paid by the users sending the transaction, but 25 bitcoins once they discover a new block"
Given that the authors clearly don't understand the basics of Bitcoin, I doubt the North Koreans were actually mining. Perhaps they were just running full nodes, or even just using some online wallet.
"that activity increased exponentially, from nothing to hundreds per day. The timing of this mining is important because it began very soon after the May WannaCry ransomware attacks"
The same article claims North Koreans read western news and social media, so maybe they were just curious, or even infected by ransomware themselves.

Every day is relevant when it comes to not keeping money on exchanges longer than necessary, including those that _do_ support BCC.
If something goes wrong with an exchange, not only do you lose your BCC there, you might also lose the BTC you sent there in order to buy it. Perhaps the price reflects that risk, perhaps not.
Until you have the actual BCC in your own wallet, it's just a number on a website, essentially an IOU from ViaBTC with little legal recourse if they don't pay.
I can't blame Coinbase for not supporting it. Think about what that would cost them, e.g. they would have to review the [hundreds of commits across hundreds of files]( that changed in the bitcoin-abc repository. Otherwise they risk the same fate as [Cryptsy]( They'd have to dedicate engineers to implement replay protection, etc.
They are also in a juristiction where suing companies over unkept promises is a lot easier than in China.
Really the most practical and honest thing they can do is just straight-up tell people that if they want BCC, they need to take their bitcoin out in time. And that's what they did.

What do you mean by this?
BIP 9 has several [states]( DEFINED, STARTED, LOCKED_IN, ACTIVE or FAILED
If 80% of miners signal bit 4 for a little over two days (336 blocks), BIP91 is LOCKED_IN. Clients running [SegWit2x code]( will then consider it ACTIVE another 2(?) days later. At this point SegWit2x clients reject any block that doesn't signal SegWit at bit 1, in the same way UASF clients would after August 1.
So what you're describing would be Jihan signaling bit 4 until BIP91 reaches the LOCKED_IN state and then switching back to e.g. the canonical Core client and not signal SegWit? He would be shooting himself in the foot in that case,  because the rest of the SegWit2x nodes will start rejecting his blocks. Alternatively he could switch to the canonical Core client but still signal SegWit in which case SegWit still activates, so that's not too useful. Of course with false signaling people can make this game as complicated as they want to, so there may be "better" variants.
@_date: 2017-07-18 06:42:58
I was only talking about the cost of pre-empting BIP148 activation as compared to ignoring that fork. I'm not talking about the cost of SegWit itself; they already decided to activate that with BIP91, so that's sunk cost (if any).

From [Wikipedia]:


How do you asses who the Svengali is?
What if it turns out in few years time the Svengali is "the entire market"? Now imagine the price of 1 MB coins is $0.01 and the price of 2 MB coins is $100,000. You buy an ice-cream for $3, but it turns out there's no replay protection, but who cares, because you just ignore the 2 MB chain. Now the IRS knocks on your door, because you didn't report that $30,000,000 tax event and it turns out accidental loss of funds is not deductible*.
If the price goes the other way around, you get a similar issue when you sell your house for bitcoin. My point is that ignoring hard-forks is not guaranteed to keep your money safe.
*= I have no idea if that's a rule; I'm assuming here that buying ice-cream is seen by the IRS as liquidating $30M worth of bitcoin and so subject to capital gains.
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:39:55
That's I think he's using the terms correctly there, except in "if you are a miner, and BIP91 does activate".
It's unpredictable when something gets LOCKED_IN, but once it's in that state it's predictable when it becomes ACTIVE. So when talking about different scenario's it makes sense to consider the LOCKED_IN time.
It's a great article. Just some minor nit-picking:


Even if these miners are fake signaling there's no risk of a chain split. SegWit blocks are valid for these miners, they just won't mine any themselves. They may occasionally mine on top of a block that's invalid under SegWit rules, but that would have to a deliberate attack and probably hurts them more than any user.


Not "could", it will lead to a split. Un-upgraded miners will reject these blocks, regardless of hash power. Un-upgraded full nodes as well. Only SPV wallets will stick with majority hash power (if I understand correctly).


The current signaling - because there's no final SegWit2x client yet - is not enforced, but it's not meaningless either, given our above discussion on credible threats and such. 


Well, they're aiming for a split regardless, so more accurate would be `to avoid a premature split`.


This is key. It's not about signaling SegWit, it's about choosing which chain to follow.


Don't forget sunk cost, and the effect of such a publicly visible switch on the value of previously mined coins you still want to sell. But to be fair, I don't think most readers are miners.
Here it gets a little strange though:


Are they planning on doing this before the next difficulty change? Because that might be a *lot* later than August 15. Or are they going to reset the difficulty on the new chain? Sounds a little ethereumesque :-) This seems like the kind of fringe scenario 99.99% of bitcoin users should just ignore, but I might be wrong.


This seems to contradict your earlier advice "just mine the most profitable chain." But yeah, things will get complicated if there's any controversy around the hard fork, and it would be a miracle if there wasn't.

You also need to find a way to get skin in the game, at least if you want to convince others you're committed. UASF tries to look like a revolutionary movement, but real revolutionaries are risking arrest or worse.
Running a node without any coins at stake on the other hand is perfectly safe. Worst case outcome is having to replace the software.
Buying mining equipment and mining behind a BIP148 node means skin in the game, but only after August 1. Right now there's no risk. Buying shares in a mining operation that is legally bound to follow BIP148 would be skin in the game, but it's not very practical (and offering such shares might get you in trouble with the SEC).
A public vouch - tied to your real world identity - to sell your non-BIP148 coins (if there's a practical way) before a certain date would go a long way.

You need to distinguish between those who ask critical questions about BIP148 and those who state that they want to kill it.
I agree with your vice-versa only for the latter category. Jihan Wu has indeed done [something like that]( though again it's just words until Aug 1.
However, even those who ignore the BIP148 fork accept the risk of getting their transaction history wiped out in a re-org. So there is a market, it's just mostly ignorant of the risks and/or perceives those risks as negligible. Anytime a merchant accepts payment after August 1 without checking if the transaction is confirmed on the BIP148 fork is implicitly taking a position.
I recently looked for prediction markets, but couldn't really find anything trustworthy either. There's a lot of different scenarios and lack of clarity on how exchanges will handle this. Some for example would take any activation of SegWit this year as a vindication of BIP148, or any price &gt; 0 for BIP148 coins. And where would one keep the collateral? I'd rather not be exposed to ETH that long :-)


This is not very practical though (apart from the replay issue). You can't predict the price of bitcoin, so making a sell offer in USD is very risky. You could use a BTC-BTC148 ratio instead, but then you don't know the USD risk you're taking. Then there's the counter-party risk, and I'm not aware of practical way to lock up these funds. And if you do lock them up, in the event BIP148 gets insufficient hash power, there's no way to get it out.
I do agree it would be great if someone can come with a good solution, some sort of prediction market perhaps. Or some really respectable person in charge of a giant betting pool with BTC (both chains) collateral.

Since the app is "invisible" you may want to consider using Passbook. That's what I did with bitcoin-passbook.com (different kind of app, but similar in that the user just cares about the current balance and notifications when something important happens).

I found this video presentation very useful: 
It starts out with how a normal bank works and then gradually introduces new elements until you end up with bitcoin.
The audio and video quality are a bit low, but there's a link to the original slides.

I don't think you can peg a (virtual) curency to anything if you can't enforce the peg with both:
1 - lots of money in foreign currencies to buy and sell bitcoins
2 - the threat of force to crack down a black market

That's true, but doesn't that get wiped as soon as soon as the user (or a memory issue) clears the browser cache? Safari has an annoying habit of deleting stuff at inconvenient moments, e.g. it tries to reload my wikitravel pages when I'm offline and then they're gone. 
I know data from native apps gets backed up to iCloud and iTunes, but I'm not sure about web apps.
I also don't know if that local storage is encrypted on disk and sandboxed from other websites.
If these 2 concerns can be met, that would make it an interesting option for me. Although I still prefer native.

From what I understand from the video above, there's no need for a third party in a Kickstarter style transaction. You can build the rule "payment valid when goal is met" right into the transactions themselves.

There's also the issue of people robbing stores (if you distribute them that way). Often that's solved by making sure the cassier has to something after the sale to activate it. 
Perhaps you can prevent disclosing the full private key until the customer or middleman performs some sort of activation. E.g. the QR code could send them to a website that reveals the missing half of the private key. This can only be done once. 
Could that be done with an accompaning app or mobile website?

If you had almost a million dollars in your bank account, would you invest them all in bitcoins? There's lots of books written about investment portolios. I think most of them agree that you need to diversify and only put a limited percentage in highly risky assets.
But that's from rational point of view. Some people give their life for a cause they truly believe in, so compared to that risking a million dollars is just money.

I initially assumed it worked the same way the Dutch website Bitonic.nl works: they offer a price per bitcoin, you transfer euros and then you receive your bitcoins.
It took me a while to realize it was more complicated: deposit money, buy bitcoins at some later time and possibly deposit those bitcoins as well. Hence the misunderstanding. That's also a lot less easy to secure.
@_date: 2013-04-26 21:30:53
With "buying" I meant buying bitcoins, not buying products with these bitcoins. 
The second stage after buying the bitcoins, could be to deposit them.
Did you give them an address to send those bitcoins to or did they offer an online wallet?

For those who are impatient, here's the updated source code for the iOs app:
It now uses the keychain and file encryption. Notes:
* never trust a jail-broken device (i.e. only people with an iOs developer account can run this safely)
* don't put the private key for more than $50 worth of bitcoins in your wallet. 
* Create a second Blockchain account for your mobile device. You can give it read-only access to your larger accounts if you want.
* if you're really paranoid, for each address that your phone knew the private key of, create a new addresses and send the Bitcoins to it. Also change your wallet password(s).
* always check the source code when downloading from strangers (see below)
* set a passcode on your iPhone, ideally 6 digits. Also enable "wipe after 10 failed attempts".
* The app also uses something called a checksumcache. I have no idea what that is and did not attempt to store that in a more secure way. It's easy to fix if it is important though.
Here's what I changed:

It's always good to have more competition for Marktplaats. And a focus on Bitcoin could get you some great media attention to get over the chicken-egg problem of users.
But what's stopping people from allowing Bitcoin payments on Marktplaats? In the end I think sellers care most about the number potential buyers and vice versa, so they'll stick to Marktplaats.
Minor UI remark: I recommend that always show the euro amount next to each bitcoin amount.

There's a technical paper that described how to achieve this (and a few other benefits) when buying from a merchant. The same principle could be applied to tips:
It does require new tools, so you can't use it now. It does boil down to creating a new address for each tip, but in a smart way where the addresses are predicatable enough for the tipping to generate one, but not so predicatable that anyone else can guess it. So transactions are private.
Changing the tipping address only helps a bit, because people could keep track of all of them. You would also need to be careful when converting back to cash, using different addresses each time to send the coins to.

I forgot Japan.
But Japan also has a debt of 230% of its GDP, which could also explain their issues. Some even suspect that their new policy of creating inflation is going to make matters worse, not better. 
Others would argue that they are just denying their default (most of the debt is held by themselves), for an impressively long time. 
Japan is the exception to almost every rule anyway.
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:15:14
If you do this, you should probably also create new bitcoin addresses and transfer your bitcoins to them.

I'm having equal difficulty finding solid evidence that inflation is a good thing. It's very hard to do proper empirical research in economics. 
One thing I do know is that out of control inflation has caused massive suffering in the past multiple times, while deflation only has a bad rep because of one bad experience (the Great Depression),  but as someone already pointed out does good things in electronics. 
Without solid research, you also have to consider incentives. Politicians have a strong incentive to believe in the benefits of inflation, because it means they can borrow more money. They also don't like hoarding, because it's more difficult to tax.
But what we really need are controlled experiments with real humans - not pretty Nobel Price winning abstract mathematical theories with zero relationship to reality - which is hard to do and even harder to do in an ethical way.

That's actually an old account for which I lost the password, but point taken :-)
There's 0 or 1 private keys in that account. I transferred the bitcoins in it to another address. Feel free to try and break the password; I'd love to reclaim my username. Of course if you succeed I won't actually use it without some additional security mechanism.

I don't how MtGox works internally, but this transaction that put 6.09 on somebody else's address is the result of combining 18 BTC from two different addresses and then depositing 6.09 on one address and 12 on another.
Which of these two original addresses (18Vnrmn... or 158RiVwt...) is yours? Neither of these ever contained 6.09 bitcoins, so do you own other addresses that when added together make exactly 6.09 bitcoins? Or does MtGox do some weird magick with the numbers here?

Their policy is to directly convert all donations (cars, bitcoins) to USD.

Some other people have also [reported this error]( recently and some were able to solve it. It seems to happen only under specific circumstances related to your wallet.
I think the main problem here is that both the Blockchain website and iPhone app use a lot of Javascript, but in the app it hasn't been updated for a year. My guess is that recently some security related changes were made on the server, causing the iOs version to break.
I'm an iOs developer myself, but I don't understand the app and this javascript well enough to easily fix this, so I created an [issue on Github](

Then teach them (if they're open to it). It's not that complicated; anyone who can trace phone calls and bank transfers, can learn how to trace bitcoins. They may hit dead ends of course, but at the same time there's plenty of mistakes a criminal can make and I wouldn't assume of all of them are smart.
If the police won't or can't help you or if that takes too long, it might make sense to post details here so people can help. But of course the thiefs read Reddit too, false accusations may result and you can't ask the FBI for more info on a suspect...

Not with the current exchange-rate volatility and "unpolished" user experience. And there's still a need for physical cash.
Also most small countries probably depend heavily on trade so they'll use whatever their business partners use. Hong Kong does have its own currency, but I'm guessing most their trade takes place in USD or RMB.

It only monitors 1 address per pass. So if you use a client that creates new change addresses all the time, that won't work. I only use a small number of addresses (mostly paper wallets) and send change back to the same address.

Thanks, I've actually studied that in some detail before because I use it's SSL wrapper. But I previously overlooked a potentially really useful example in *examples/generate_tx.rb*.
The example provides clarity on on how the encoding is supposed to be. Unfortunately when I modify my own code to match, I still get the invalid signature error.
The next thing I'll try is to sign a transaction using the example code and try to submit that. That way I can be sure if the example is correct (unfortunately if it it throws an error that doesn't prove the example in incorrect).

Isn't MtGox legally required to submit 1099 forms to the IRS for their USA based customers?

Strange: I was pretty sure that the official Blockchain iOs app did not have the option to send bitcoins, but I just installed it from the App Store and it does. My device runs iOs 6.1.3 and is not jailbroken.
However when I try to send 0.0005 bitcoins to from my "mobile wallet" address to an another address I own I get the following error: "Cannot ask for private key without user interaction disabled".
It should be noted that I previously had another version installed; I'm a developer so I downloaded the source code from Github (and made it a bit more secure).
What does this message mean?
Has anyone been able to succesfully make a payment with the iPhone app on a non-jailbroken device? Which version of iOs?
Also, what's the relationship between Blockchain.info and Qkos Services Ltd who publish the app?

Every address starts with 1. There's a 1 in 58 chance of the next letter being an L, 1 in 58 * 58 * 58 * 58 of those 4 letters. So all you need to do to get such a vanity address is to write a script that generates about 10 million random addresses until it finds one that starts with the text you want. 4 isn't impressive.

You're more than welcome to create a cheaper competitor.
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:03:00
I see.
Given that those 6.09 bitcoins are on a new address, as long as the bitcoins don't start moving there's no way to find them by just looking at the transaction in the blockchain.
However the thief can't do anything with the coins unless he moves them again. So you should set some sort of notication service on that address, e.g. add it as a read-only address in an (online) wallet. 
Best case scenario he'll do something stupid or he gets arrested for some other reason, the police find that private key, know what to do with it and know where to find you.
Another trail is to follow that IP in China to whever that leads, but that's probably a lot of red tape and erased server logs.
@_date: 2013-04-26 18:18:08
Did your bitcoins get stolen from your bitcoin-24 account? If so, did you report that to the police? If not, why not? 
The more people who report bitcoin theft, the more the police will take it seriously (if they don't already) and the more likely criminals get arrested. 
Reports of these arrests should at least discourage some 16 year olds living with their parents from pillaging.
@_date: 2013-04-26 21:39:14
I see what you mean. In that case, did he try to call the bank and tell them to reverse the transfer? I think there's a 90 day term for that in Europe. Might not work though if that account is now empty or frozen.
@_date: 2013-04-26 21:33:50
I agree that there's no need to claim that bitcoin 24 stole anything. Only to report that the money is gone and possibly stolen by someone.

Energy costs = [power consumption in Watt] / 1000 * 24 * [number of days] * [electricity price per KwH]
I suspect energy costs will become a huge component. That in turn could lead to problems in countries with high energy prices: it would become more attractive to steal electricity from the grid.

Are you synchroning it with iTunes? If those files end up on a Windows machine, you're doomed :-)
Other than that, I would say it's safe as long as you don't lose the phone.

I [patched]( the iOs app so it stores the credentials in the Keychain and encrypts the wallet file.
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:45:17
Can you elaborate on the first point? When I use the website as a normal user, I need a password to open my wallet. 
Are you saying the server can give you the encrypted wallet before it validates the password?
If so, I agree that's not ideal. It would be better if all potential brute force attacks have to go through the server first, so they can be slowed down, stopped or at least noticed.
@_date: 2013-05-05 10:35:18
That cryptic error message usually means that you forgot to select from which address you want to send bitcoins.

Just google "bitcoin vanity address", but be very careful to trust anyone who claims they can make one for you. Maybe there's a tutorial out there that can teach you how to do it yourself.
A ruby script that uses bitcoin-ruby to generate new address would be an easy way, albeit perhaps slow. Something like this:
require "bitcoin-ruby"
while true
  key = Bitcoin::generate_key
  address = Bitcoin::pubkey_to_address(key[1])
  puts key; break if address[0..4]=="1ABCD"

I don't know the details of the top of my hat, but you need to make sure that any iCloud backup can only be restored to the same device. 
Otherwise a hacker only needs the iCloud password of a user to get access to his private key. Also any backups in iTunes pose a threat, especially if they have a windows machine.
There are one or more WWDC talks about encryption and security that should clarify what's possible.
I suggest that you warn people not to put too much money in their mobile wallet and explain under which circumstances they will lose everything.
With regards to what Apple allows, I'm not sure what the exact situation is. See this thread:

Reporting this to the police is probably a good start.
That IP could just be some sort of relay.
Apart from the IP address there's also the chain of transactions you can follow. If you can figure out where the bitcoins were spent on goods or traded for money, those are places where you might be able to find the identity of the thief. The police has more means to get that kind of information.
Is there a good tutorial / wiki / documentation on how to investigate these things?
