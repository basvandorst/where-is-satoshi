Unfortunately no (I'm 36r as well).  We import whatever we can get at a large discount, and in our current lots we don't have any 36r.
We do have sweaters in your size, and I'll shoot you a PM regarding other items not listed on the site.
@_date: 2014-02-01 19:35:06
Sweet.  I'm looking into it now!
@_date: 2014-02-01 19:16:03
It's not! We'll ship anywhere.  We just need to find a price for shipping to your location.
@_date: 2014-02-01 19:36:52
Wow, thanks everyone for the positive response!
I'm talking to my partner about launch a second bitcoin focused service as well!
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:56:54
Nope, we ship worldwide!
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:06:02
You know what.  I'll do a 20% off coupon for anyone ordering with Bitcoin.  If anyone is interested, PM me for the code. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 19:07:40
Nope, should we?

I gladly accept bitcoin on my site which sells high end suits:
I'm sorry about your aunt.
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:57:49
Do it!  I want some of that BTC soup!
Really though, these things are beautiful.

If you mouseover the "shop" 
then "belvest" or "venanzi" 
then the item type "sport coats" for example
Size options will pop up
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:16:05
I'll accept the other coins at market rate, and trade for Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:38:01
I will accept litecoin!
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:13:37
Especially primecoins... (maths student here)
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:01:54
Unfortunately we do not sell fedoras.
We do sell suits that I believe would complement said fedoras quite well though...
@_date: 2013-12-14 08:49:01
pics of the bitcoins or the fedoras?
@_date: 2013-12-14 08:47:17
I'll accept anoncoin, frankos, and xrp as well.
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:15:17
Yeah, in all seriousness, I agree.  It's on the list... limited resources...
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:42:09
Ok, we now implemented a Bitcoin checkout so that you don't have to arrange for payment via email!
