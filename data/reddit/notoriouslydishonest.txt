That's actually super easy, and probably inevitable.

Bitcoin's gone from a currency, to a store of value, to "I spent $200 on 0.01, it's got to be worth *something*".
I have a feeling the next phase of this cycle won't be pretty.

Investments generally don't move like that.
Here's the year-over-year price changes for bitcoin, starting at the end of 2012.
    2013- Up 5,480%
    2014- Down 58%
    2015- Up 35%
    2016- Up 122%
    2017 (as of today)- Up 1100%
There's definitely an upward trend, but the year to year changes are all over. I'm sure there were a lot of people who made fortunes in 2013 who thought "I'm not expecting it to explode again, but it should at least double next year."  Instead, they lost more than half their value.  It peaked at $1075 at the end of November 2013, and it didn't hit that price again for almost 3.5 years.

Fiat can kill crypto a lot easier than crypto can kill fiat.
I believe that crypto technology is useful and amazing, but I don't have much faith in its inevitability. This isn't like other technology booms we've seen- the vested powers and the government have the ability to make crypto coins permanently and irreparably useless if they want to, and they probably will.

The US is pretty reactionary right now.  All of the big east Asian countries are huge on government control.  It's not hard to imagine a near future where most of the world's biggest economies have significant restrictions on bitcoin usage/ownership.

Here's a [cult identification checklist](
There's a lot of room for interpretation, but I'd say r/Bitcoin exhibits 9 of the 15 traits. It's pretty damn culty.

Sounds like that last line was a poorly phrased comment by the author. Nothing in PwC's statement says that they're actively accepting Bitcoin, they just said they accepted a single transaction.
Until the Bitcoin option is widely available and being used by a significant number of customers, this is nothing more than PR. Its a big boring accounting firm shouting"we're hip with the new technology" without actually putting their neck out.

Your links show that it's impossible to stop people from *buying* bitcoin.  That's true.
They don't say anything about stopping people from *using* bitcoin.  That's a lot easier. 
If the US government says that bitcoin is illegal, and that American companies cannot accept bitcoin as payment, and that any foreign companies accepting bitcoin cannot use USPS/private delivery companies to deliver packages...bitcoin would be pretty much dead there, as a currency.  You could still find ways to buy it online, but what's the point of buying coins which can't be redeemed for goods and services?
The people getting around China's ban are speculators, not consumers.  It's almost impossible to stop people from speculating, but it's pretty simple to devalue the thing they're speculating on.

A major company accepted a single Bitcoin transaction, and then bragged about it online. There's no evidence of a significant policy change for normal customers (yet). This could be a sign of changes to come, or it could be purely a "look how progressive we are" PR stunt. Only time will tell.

The guys who project Bitcoin to go to the moon will make a huge profit if it does.
The guys who project it to fail will gain nothing if they're correct. 
Bitcoin boosters always remind me a bit of MLM evangelists, who sell the Amway/Herbalife/whatever dream to thousands of poor people hoping to boost their own income. They aren't our friends or our allies, they're people who got in early and need our investment to enrich themselves.

 About 98% of my monthly spending is on either physical items that are easily tracked, or payments to large corporations which are even easier to track (like rent and insurance).
If Bitcoin can't be used to legally buy things, it has no future. No one is going to invest in a currency that's only usable on the black market. The true believers will be able to find workarounds, of course, but Bitcoin's current valuation is based off the assumption that it'll one day be used to buy houses and groceries. The government can easily kill that outcome.

[Here is the price chart for gold over the past 100 years](
Ya, gold still kept some value, but it also dropped 65% over a nearly 40 year time span.  It basically died, and was reborn only because the laws changed.  If that's Bitcoin's future, I'd guess 90% of the current owners/enthusiasts would abandon it, and the remaining 10% would include a lot of people that you *really* don't want to be associated with.

You're living in a fantasy world.
People who have never worked with large corporations seem to think that they're completely amoral greed machines that will break any law they can conceivably get away with to make an extra dollar.
People who have worked there know that's laughable.  They'll try to cut corners and interpret things favorably, of course, but they don't fuck around with the law.  Not when they're risking punitive damages, instead of small fines.  The important thing is to keep the chain moving, not to maximize profits for 6 months before getting slapped hard.
Amazon, Walmart and Bank of America are **not** going to accept crypto if the US government says they shouldn't.  Full stop, it won't happen.  And if the penalties are sufficiently harsh (like, foreign retailers that accept crypto payments could lose their right to ship to US addresses), the smaller companies won't either.  
If a law like I described passes (and it's not hard to foresee, I'd guess China would be first), crypto would be back to where it was 5 years ago- totally useless, except for tech true believers and the online black market.

You don't need to 100% ban crypto to kill it.
Here's a simple 2 point plan:
1. Stores, including online and foreign stores, are not allowed to accept payment in crypto currency (with harsh penalties)
2. Banks are not allowed to accept money transfers to or from known crypto exchanges
What's the future hold for a cryptocoin after that?  Who would bother converting their useful fiat to a useless crypto that can't be used to buy anything except black market goods?
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:02:37
If you're seriously thinking banning cryptos is even 0.1% as difficult as banning cars or the internet, you've spent *way* too much time on these forums.

Shorting volatile assets like Bitcoin is extremely risky and expensive. Even if you're correct about the future trend, it's easy to lose money on it.
I'd be very surprised if guys like Stiglitz would mess around with that. There are much safer and easier ways to make money.
@_date: 2018-04-30 08:02:14
And this is **exactly** why fiat is still more useful than Bitcoin.
A currency that can't be used by normal people to buy and sell is not really a currency. And an investment in something that can't do the thing is was intended to do probably isn't a safe investment.

Also, no promising new technology has ever failed to achieve mass adoption.
