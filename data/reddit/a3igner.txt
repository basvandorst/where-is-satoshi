Did you copy Heineken‘s Logo or not?
If you used Heinekens logo as a basis then yes you are infringing copyrights. If you drew everything yourself from scratch you are not infringing Copyright directly. 
This can be easily proven by the angles and widths lengths corners etc of your logo. 
My guess is that it just happens to look similar. So they can only sue you for similarity not a copyright violation. In your interest it’s best to take it offline. It’s not worth the hassle and the reference of bitcoin to beer is silly and not funny to me at all personally.
Not worth to fight the legal system over such a silly thing.

He is a simple con men. Lining his pockets by pumping coins he bought beforehand. Why do you guys even listen to him or give him so much attention? Who cares what his prediction is or what his bet is.

unrealized profits. tax-free. you are right until they realize their profits by selling this doesn't lower the price. but it just keeps increasing the price as long as people are investing their savings every month into bitcoin. you get a much higher return than on your savings account. this is just my view.

But according to you Bitcoin Cash is the original Bitcoin!
