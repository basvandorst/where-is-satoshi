Why don't you provide sources stating it is illegal and we will go from there?

Coinbase is the AOL of crypto. They make it easy for noobs to swap fiat for coins, and they charge high fees for it. Coinbase and GDAX are the same company, but GDAX is the exchange and has lower fees. Both only trade BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, USD and EUR, so forget minor altcoins. Bitstamp is similar to trading pairs, but has lower fees and trades XRP. Bittrex and Poloniex are major crypto-only exchanges with much wider altcoin support.


Use limit orders and do some reading on maker/taker fees for the exchange. You probably want Bitstamp though.

I still don't understand how this is possible?

I used it last night to send funds to Coinbase. I submitted the transfer at 7:30pm and Coinbase acknowledged the deposit at 9:30am today. Very impressive.

You can't spend your BTC and HODL it too. When you look back, 1 Tesla now will be like those 10,000 BTC pizzas.

Sounds like you're greedy. Should I be fearful?

I guess if it can't resist this kind of market manipulation by a relatively small group, then it's inherently flawed anyway.

Have a look at this guy's [post history]( and then close this thread and carry on with your life.

Yeah, I also think they might try and short the hell out of it.

I added it last night for the 1st time.
