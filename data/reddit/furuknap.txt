As some have suggested, there are two problems with 'proving' the security in this manner.
1. The chances given time that someone picks the same phrase increases. 7 days isn't representative. How long does it take before two people come up with the brilliant idea of using "the land of the free and the home of the brave" as a passphrase? 
2. In an attack on a sufficiently interesting target, I'd find out more about you, your habits, interests, etc, before I built a dictionary to use as attack. In fact, I'd probably just look at your browser history based on what you post here.
I've written an article today on how brainwallets work and why they are not secure when used as many believe they should be used.

Yes, and it's not just a matter of wallet security either. Passwords and passphrases in any secure systems, where chosen by people, are susceptible to the same problem.
The only 'benefit' you may have, as mentioned in the article, is if you have some way of limiting the rate at which an attacker can attempt to crack your passphrase. Sites where the passphrase is used in an off-blockchain manner (like Coinbase) may help in this regard, but of course they'll be equally susceptible to attack if their passphrase database would be compromised. 
People are inherently bad at both originality and randomness, and when those are the key components of generating secure passphrases, people will be bad at generating good ones :-)

People, chill, the price will go down and it will go up and it will do so many times more. No reason to freak out.  
Bitcoin isn't crashing, the exchange rate is, and that's not really that important. Better to stabilize at $10 to give predictability to merchants than to fluctuate 200% in a month, making it impossible for anyone to price anything in BTC for more than an hour at a time.

Well, Friedcat, if I understood [the update]( correctly, said that there will be more auctions. I doubt they will wait for several months.

Keep in mind, they have a lot of these available. They have tons of new hashing power coming in before anyone else.

Technical analysis will only take you so far. The major difference between BTC and 'stock' or other currencies is that absolutely nobody knows how to price it. Right now, it's priced on mass interest, not because adoption and usability is X% more or less than 2 weeks ago, with X being the price difference in USD. 
@_date: 2013-03-31 15:00:17
You are not off, in my opinion.
In my understanding, I can't see Bitcoins being more or less used for money laundering or other criminal activities than fiat currencies or other valuables. There are ways to anonymize transactions to the extent that it is difficult or maybe even impossible to trace funds. However, this is also possible with cash, diamonds, gold, or any other 'anonymous' value that can be easily traded. 
However, it doesn't really matter. Yes, criminals will use Bitcoins. So will everyone else. Bitcoins won't make criminals.
I think that they fear of criminals taking over Bitcoins stems from fear of the unknown, not from rational analysis, as is the case for many new technologies. Torrents were the downfall of music. TOR was the end of all online law enforcement. VPN and proxies will surely make the terrorists win. These are all appeal to emontion fallacies based on not knowing enough about the technology rather than from having sufficient knowledge. 
We can't fear criminals using technology to the extent that we avoid new technologies on that basis alone. If we do, the terrorists win :-P

@_date: 2013-04-02 20:49:22
That would be true if they're not out of coins all the time. The 'no more coins rolling limit' was really no problem at all. You could divide up your purchases in smaller batches and they'd go through much faster. Granted, if you for example purchased 10 BTC in 1BTC increments, your cost would rise from $0.15 to $1.5, but for a $1000 purchase, that's still peanuts. 
Now you buy now but pay later in a market that's booming and at least extremely volatile. That's a huge risk.

Actually, I hope they do, even as a current investor. 
There's no reason why they should, though, because an increasing price of BTC means lower cost for them because their expenses are paid in RMB. Income is teady, expenses deline with rising BTC price and increases with lower BTC prices.

@_date: 2013-05-13 19:49:25
You've been *clear* all along, but that doesn't make you *right*. 
If you believe the price of Bitcoin is going up, the only sensible thing to do is hold Bitcoin, and we seem to agree on that. 
However, difficulty has nothing to do with it because there is no causuality between unit price and difficulty of acquisition. Mining will never be more profitable than holding Bitcoin if the price rises.
If you believe the price goes down, then buying mining equipment will always be more profitable than holding coins (although less profitable than holding USD or whatever currency you used to denominate your mining assets). Again, difficulty is completely irrelevant because it has no direct impact on price (Litecoin skyrocketed in price before the difficulty rose where Feathercoin price crashed after the difficulty rose. Bitcoin difficulty stayed comparatively the same when the price rose to $266 and didn't go down a speck when price crashed later)
Look, let's put Occam's razor to the test. Your claim is that a number of 15% increase in acquisition cost will yield mining investment unprofitable. The rest of the world does not know this. 
Keep in mind 'the rest of the world' is not limited to cryptocoin mining; the same math applies to any currency pair where investments denominated in one currency produces revenue denominated in another currency, like oil drilling equipment in UAE being denominated in Dirham while producing income denominated in USD. 
Do you really believe that the simplest explanation making the fewest assumptions is that you are right and the rest of the world is wrong?

The problem with AMC is that they trade on Bitfunder. Despite numerous attempts over the previous two months, I've not been able to set up an account with that wee exchange thing they're using. I don't trust sites that both look fishy and return error messages like "There seems to be a problem" with absolutely no further explanation. 
If AMC listed on BTCT or Pico, I might take a closer look. 
@_date: 2013-05-23 13:03:07
The topic statement isn't entirely correct. As far as I've been able to determine, 100TH is, at least so far, more like a bond that gives you 200mh/s per share, whereas ASICMiner is a share in a company. 
There seems to be some confusion over at Bitcointalk.org whether there is an opening for turning 100TH into a more AM-like share. One side argues that this wouldn't make sense for the asset issuer, the other argues that the issuers may very well decide to turn the asset around and both expand and start selling hardware because the profitability is so good.
In terms of the claimed numbers, while these are correct (and the jumps are actually higher now), hashing at 5 times what AM currently does in two months isn't really relevant because at that time, AM may very well have put more power online. 
On the other hand, 100TH will have fewer problems finding room for their boards due to increased efficiency, and AM has previously struggled with bringing so much power online in their data centers. 
Still, considering that this is a big risk in any case, I see 100TH as undervalued compared to AM. AM has proven they can deliver, but that proof is already baked into the price at this point. There isn't much room for AM to grow in the mid to long term (they already paid the equivalent of 50% of the entire mining revenue of Bitcoin last week) and can thus only disappoint from now on. We saw this to some extent yesterday, when dividends dropped over 40% from last week and share prices dropped 15% in 24 hours.
If 100TH delivers, the entire upside of fulfilling their promise is not realized in the share price at this point.
Keep in mind, investments in BTC are incredibly risky. I have put some coins into 100TH so assume that I'm writing this to increase the price and interest, which gives me a direct benefit. Always do your own research and verify any claims from as independent sources as you can find.
EDIT: tl;dr, be careful, read what you can, make up yor own mind!

My analysis does not speculate in which company delivers when at all. 
Besides, your point is rather contrived. You're comparing buying mining equipment with buying a share that mines for you. Would you compare the cost of a shovel, pickaxe, and barrel to a share in ExxonMobil? 
@_date: 2013-05-13 09:16:53
You're not really bothering with listening, are you? Like I said, I needed a new computer in any case, which changes the math. Without my new computer, I could not work as efficiently, thus reducing my non-crypto related revenue. My loss in revenue would far exceed any price increase with the investment made. 
Also, because I have a fixed sell price, I make money from day X (where X is the number of days required to pay off the added GPUs), which from then is pure profit less electricity but independent of depreciation of hardware. My profitability in this case is not dependent on the depreciation of hardware which normally is the biggest expense in any mining investment.

I've been using Coinbase steadily for several weeks and have not had any persistent problems. I dislike their new policy on charging based on a future price, and I've often encountered that even though I accept that added risk, Coinbase is still out of purchasing ability, but if you're willing to work with that, they've been stable for me.
I did discover a few days ago that there was something messed up with the transaction logs, where all completed transactions were dated the day before (although the actual transaction details listed them as happening at their correct times). What freaked me out for a little while was that I had just purchased BTC, and that transaction was not showing at all. 
I emailed support and it was fixed in a couple of hours, with no loss to me. 
I should note that I've made numerous purchases, so my one freaked-out experience was the exception to the rule. I've found them to be stable, reliable, very easy to use, and friendly in response to inquiries.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:08:01
I don't think Litecoin will replace Bitcoins, I think they both have merit and needs to be around for some time in order for society to decide what particular characteristics it wants. Despite Bitcoin having several years to its name, it's still extremely new and haven't been tested extensively as a societal component. 
Do we even want it? If we want it, how will we use it? If we use it, can we think of better ways to use it? If we can find better ways of using it, how can we build that into the system? 
When or if Bitcoin becomes mainstream, it will be under scrutity at a level we haven't been close to seeing even in the past couple of months. It will evolve or it will die, perhaps supplanted by other and more suitably adapted coins. 
@_date: 2013-04-27 11:21:23
I'm not a lawyer, but I can't really see this being an SEC issue at all. AM is incoirporated in China and BTCT is incorporated in Belize. Because stock purchases can be anonymous, there's really no benefit for SEC to make life miserable; they would only encourage anonymous stock purchases which are much harder to track.
It's one of the classic arguments for legalization of narcotics (no, I do not hold an opinion in either direction). By making drugs illegal, the trade goes underground where it takes far more resources to control. A legalized drug trade would make it much easier to control supply, monitor traders and users, and even better (for them), tax the trade.

Just to clarify about the psychological benefit, it is likely a benefit in BTC's favor due to it probaby being more valuable per coin. I don't know what benefits Litecoin will have because I don't know what the future holds, but again, diversity is important :-)

That's what leads me to think about the math... I mean, investing in mining is pretty much betting that the price of BTC in USD will go down, otherwise, why not just hold on to the BTC and sell later? 
I really don't understand what models these people are using, and the simple calculations I've seen in the forums are at best extremely speculative. 
In my view, as I've elaborated [here]( 'investors' need to determine three factors:
1. Exchange rate at all points in the future up until the investment has been paid off
2. Influx of new or migration of existing mining operations
3. Difficulty evolution
None of these are easy to predict, and all three combined seem impossible to predict from my perspective, especially considering that increase or decrease in one factor may seriously affect other factors. In other words, an increase in price can lead to more people mining which can lead to higher difficulty which can lead to fewer people mining which can lead to higher prices which can lead to more people mining.... 
It's a headache to me... I have no idea how people dare put $9K into something so uncertain, but I congratulate them on their bravery and for what their investments mean to the history of Bitcoin.

A few months ago, comparatively few people knew what bitcoin miners were.
@_date: 2013-04-27 09:26:41
Actually, in ASICMiner case, that is the exact opposite. 
ASICMiner has a steady income in BTC but varying expenses in RMB, as far as we can determine. friedcat has said that he expects an average of 10% of the network power in 2013, which means that on average, AM will generate ~11K BTC per month. This is the level where they currently mine (having roughly ~8 TH/s of the ~70 TH/s network). 
If the price of BTC/RMB goes up, meaning BTC gets more expensive, they will still hash at ~11K per month. In other words, exchange rates do not affect earnings in any way. 
On the other hand, AM expenses are most likely (at least have been so far) denominated in RMB, so a high exchange rate means that the profit of AM goes up because the amount of BTC they have to pay to cover those RMB expenses goes down. 
In other words, AM profit goes up as exchange rate increases, and goes down as exchange rate declines. An AM share investment is doubling the effect of a change in BTC exchange rate, so a 100% rise in BTC exchange rate means your stocks, denominated in BTC, will rise 100% _and_ your earnings from AM dividends go up (albeit not 100%). 
If the exchange rate goes down, you lose value in your BTC denominated stocks _and_ that your earnings in AM dividends go down. 
For a company that has income in USD/RMB/EUR, however, your analysis is correct.

Maybe not, but 10x isn't that far off. AM has already said they're looking at putting another 200 TH/s online (in addition to their currently scheduled 50 and the 7 they already have). BFL may ship within a few months, and if they have 200 TH/s in preorders, we've already added almost 8x to the network. Avalon, the Swedes, and others may also finally get their act together. I don't think reaching 600 TH/s by the end of the year is unlikely.

Sure, but you also need to consider the price of entry for new investors. For someone who does not have BTC to invest, ฿1 is not the same ฿1 it was when the price was $40. 
This also affects future profitability, and is what I meant by not having insight into the financials. Are expenses and liabilities denoteeed in USD or BTC? Most likely expenses are USD, but for assets and liabilities, who knows? This will affect the profitability of the company and can be disastrous if the exchange rate goes in the wrong direction. On the other hand, it can also mean expenses are virtually non-existant, if the price of a BTC goes to $1,000,000. 
It's uncertain, which means high risk. If you're willing to take that risk, I have some stock to sell you at ฿2 :-)

It's not easy to explain DMS.Selling (or any DMS.*) but essentially it is this: You buy them in pairs (one .Mining and one .Selling). Mining pays out like a mining contract from the funds collected selling all of the assets. 
The minimum held back is 400 days of dividends for .Mining. Any surplus from that (plus ROI in the held assets) is paid out as dividends to .Selling. So, if difficulty rises, less money must be held back and thus .Selling gets a dividend.
It's more complex than this, though, and it's a very dangerous asset unless you understand that complexity.

I understand they don't want to hold funds, so I have no quarrel with that. My point was simply that it would be more understandable if they had an 'instant buy' option. 
As to your second question, I would rather have them implement a conditional transaction or something like that, which would allow them to reverse a transaction if the price increased beyond a certain point, for example. The net result for them would be the same; the buyer could set a limit to how much they wanted to pay per BTC rather than how much money they wanted to spend.

Now, if the price crashes to $1 per ฿ in a month, how much is that 7950 worth? Maybe ฿300ish? 
Tell me you can beat going from ฿2 to ฿300 with mining in a month. Please do. 
Investing in mining is always a bet that prices of ฿ go down. Read up on it and stop being so stubborn. It's math telling you this, not me.

Price is always a factor unless you denominate your all your expenses in fixed BTC. Besides, difficulty increases lead to marginal miners falling off which can lower difficulty again.

I doubt the dividends from the auction is what drives people to double the price over a few hours. The dividend from the sales, even if 100% of the sale price would be paid out, is ฿0.001875 per share if counting all the 400K shares. Even if you count only the floating stock, it's still just 0.00375 and hardly anything to pay 0.8 for :-)
@_date: 2013-05-13 08:03:51
Evaluating mining profitability is extremely complex, far more than most realize. It's never just about the price of BTC or the difficulty or even the two combined. To determine whether mining makes sense from a financial perspective, you need to know be able to predict the future of so many variables that you'd probably want to play lotto instead :-)
I wrote an article about this a couple of weeks ago:
I'm also in the process of writing a book on the topic of mining, and you can find a link to that from the top menu of that article.

Well, that makes the whole process a gamble for the user, much like playing with futures, which is far beyond the scope of what normal users should expect. I understand their reluctancy to take on that risk, but I'm not sure I like that they push it over on the user, especially since they don't seem to have a way to 'fund' an account for instant purchases at market price, like MTG and others.

@_date: 2013-04-20 11:46:31
TBH, now that I think about it, selling makes perfect sense. Without being accurate, let me see if I have these numbers fairly correct.
For the first point, if we ignore the price of sale or exchange rate for the sake of the argument (and I don't know whether it makes financially sense, but I'm guessing they've run the numbers), the ability to stay ahead of the competition is what drives the current race to deploy ASICs. 
In other words, having the biggest possible gap down to any competitors means more reward. ASICMiner is scheduled to add 50 TH/s next week, which gives them a huge advantage, even if Avalong gets their shipment out two weeks from now. They can essentially roam free, gaining 40-50% of all BTC mined (current network speed estimated at ~65 TH/s, and AM already has 7 TH/s for a total of 57 TH/s out of the total of 115ish TH/s). 
Let's say they decide to sell 10 TH, whether they sell it today or commit that to be sold over the next months or weeks will reduce the edge by 20%. When they sell is irrelevant because they need to take those machines out of their own pool (or sell used machines, which probaly isn't quite as cool)
Now, the total BTC mined the next two weeks is just north of ฿50K, of which, for simplicity sake, we'll guess AM can get ฿25K at full power. Reduce that by 20% and it costs ฿5K BTC in lost revenue. 
However, they sold 10 GH/s at roughly ฿75, so at best, this means selling 1000 as much for revenue of ฿75K and a total profit of ฿70K. 
Either I have something wrong here, or this is a brilliant move. 
BTW, difficulty increases don't come into play because they even out for everyone. This is also the reason why the time frame must be short. 
There's several hundred TH/s coming out during 2013, if BFL delivers, Avalon gets deployed as planned, AM gets their new 200 TH/s, etc, meaning a 10 GH/s at the end of the year may be the equivalent of 2-3 GH/s now. From what I can find, and some guess work at what BFL has in the pipe, the network may reach or even exceed 500 TH/s at some point during the year, and that means those new Erupter blades drop to 20-25% relative profitability. 
If BFL ships this summer, perhaps 200 TH/s and AM gets their 200 TH/s by the same time, the ฿75 must in majority be earned by then, otherwise it will be as valuable as 4-5 7950 today. With a doubling of hash rate within a week or so from AMs new 50 TH/s, I'm not sure that's possible.

Datacxenters and new generations require massive funding and I haven't found any financial reports that can tell me whether they have financed this already or would need to issue more stock. 
Selling old hardware is like selling old cars; unless you've paid them off, there are still liabilities so you won't really make money. Besides, the value is probably very low at this point due to the speed at which evolution carries newer and higher hashrates to term.
A new trading platform, maybe, but that's hardly what people are buying today.

If you spend 50 Bitcoins when the price is $1, and gain 40 Bitcoins that you sell when the value is $200, you've paid $50 to gain $8000. On the other hand, if you pay ฿50 when the price is $115 and you make ฿60 that you sell when the price is $10, you've paid $10K to 'earn' $600.

Oh, and to not sound overly positive or get slapped for trying to talk the price up, I really, really don't understand the pricing of ASICs, which freaks me out a bit. 
I understand AM hashing business, I have no idea how the sales will work out. To me, it seems strange to sell existing hashing power in an upwards trending market (and no, I'm not talking about today or even April, I'm talking previous six months). It sounds even stranger to _buy_ in an upwards trending market, especially because the premium paid for being an early adapter must be written off incredibly fast (And I'm thinking weeks, possibly a few months). 
If the motivation of these buyers is to get a piece of the arms race cake, their profit calculations must be based on extremely short time frames, and I can't understand how that can work out. 
tl/dr; I don't understand one half of AM business - the selling of units.

The one thing about AM that people can't seem to understand is that the income doesn't increase with increased hashrate. AM already gets (or got) 35% of Bitcoing mining income. If they quadruple their mining power, they will still only get 35% of Bitcoin mining income (technically at most ~~51%~~ 49% but they won't, due to policy). They can only deploy 1000 THs if the rest of the network is 2500 THs. When that happens, their 1000 THs will give exactly the same dividends as 60 THs does now.
In other words, the income cannot increase; only costs can. As mining gets more expensive due to competition, ROI can only go down. 
Edit: Was a bit tired last night, meant 49% not 51%.

You realize that saying the same thing over and over doesn't make it true, right?
The amount of a currency is completely irrelevant to profitability. If your goal is to get as much of unit A as possible, and you have a unit B denominated operation that generates unit A, then a declining value of unit A is always preferable because relative to unit A, unit B rises in value. 
Try doing your math with Zimbabwean dollars over the previous 10 years and see if getting a shitload of them makes sense from a profitability point of view. Then, try doing the same math from the point of view of someone who has Zimbabwean dollars in 2003 and see if how the math works out then.

No, you misunderstand. The bet is whether someone will buy PMBs at too high a price, where Buy means buying from the issuer. If I choose to pay BTC100 in a second-hand market for one share of DMS.Mining, it has 0% impact on the bet (and thus dividends). 
Feel free to argue semantics about whether you chose to interpret my statement about "You buy" as meaning "whatever you pay anywhere". It still does not explain nor clairfy the asset.

If you don't know what a red herring is, I suggest you look it up. If you don't understand why your argument is a red herring, I strongly suggest you look it up. 
If that is too difficult for you, please explain why you equate owning mining equipment with investing in an asset that mines.

I'll let you have my ฿0.02. I am a current stock holder, so keep that in mind. I'm trying to be realistic, though. 
What freaks me out is that I do not understand what people are buying on several levels. As I wrote in another thread, AM has now started selling hardware. I cannot for the life of me understand why people buy those devices at those prices, but that's a very good thing for AM. 
On another level, what drives people to buy stocks? AM enjoys a reputation for reliability that far exceeds any of the other ASIC vendors or ventures. That, combined with the immaturity and downright fraud in many stocks and bonds in the cryptostock scene may lead people to go to a 'safe haven' and give value to AMs lack of failure rather than their proof of success. 
I also believe people buy into the idea that AM will take over Bitcoin mining or a substantial part of it. However, and again I've written this in another thread, many ASIC units come to the market soon, so AMs ability to deliver over time is in question. Friedcat, as far as I've read, has stated that he expects AM to control no more than 10% of the network's hashing power in 2013. 
Finally, although dividends are fine, I still have not seen or found any financial reports that can describe the details of the operation; where do they have risks? What are the current assets and liabilities, and in which currencies are those assets and liabilities denominated?
On the plus side, if they manage to quickly offload their spare units for a premium, including the new USB thingies, then they may reap enough cash. On the minus side, again, without any insight into the financials, I don't know whether this is enough to keep the company running much less deliver the evolution required for future growth.
I don't mean to sound negative; I've been very positive, even today, in other threads. I am an investor and would love you all to pay ฿50 per share, but I cannot right now understand what it is that people are buying. Perhaps it's just that people want to be part of an adventure not caring about investing risks and potential rewards. 
I would not buy at these levels, not because I don't have confidence in the company, but simply because I don't understand what drives the current price.
