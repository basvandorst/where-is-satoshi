Trump Derangement Syndrome is a very common affliction. This behavior is one of its symptoms and could bring millions to Bitcoin!

That's true for the last year, But BTC's initial climb to 13k started a lot longer ago than that. Ever since the January 2018 crash, people would have been far better off in Bitcoin which has been outperforming them all year.  
It is interesting also to look back at the previous Bitcoin mania of 2013 and see how most of the top altcoins around then barely still exist. The winning altcoins of the next Bubble may be ones you've barely heard of yet. Which, from the thousands, will they be this time?

That's all very well to say in hindsight, but you would had to have chosen at least one of the correct 10 altcoins to enjoy those gains and you would also have to have avoided the thousands of other altcoins that would have negated those gains. If you have done this then congratulations, you are a member of a very narrow subset of individuals.

LOL. It isn't. But it should be a good film and fun night overall, particularly if Torsten's last film is anything to go by.

Unfortunately not. It's being shown at Event Cinemas on George Street with tickets sold using the demand film system. I agree booking fees are stupid but we have no choice in that. Why separate it out if there is no way to get a ticket without paying it? The ticket is $23.95 but these corporations think you can't add up.

That's great to hear. I wasn't aware you'd arranged for that :-)

Join award-winning filmmaker Torsten Hoffmann for the Tuesday night premiere screening of his latest documentary, Cryptopia: Bitcoin, Blockchains and the Future of the Internet.
In 2014, Torsten set on a journey to meet the big brains and big egos of the emerging crypto industry.
Five years down the track, some of the hackers, hipsters and hustlers that Torsten met in 2014 have done big things, whilst others have broken their promises and changed their views.
The brings up the questions - can we trust them to build a trustless new cyber utopia?
Torsten interviews some of the biggest names in the cryptoverse in the pursuit of the truth behind bitcoin, blockchains and the future of the internet to answer the ultimate question: can blockchain technology, designed to operate independent of trust and within a decentralized network, really provide a robust alternative to our current systems?
This will be an incredible film, and a great first foray into learning about Bitcoin if you've wanted to know more.
We'll close the night off with a Panel, hosted by CEO &amp; Founder of finder.com, Fred Schebesta.

That happened to many Bitcoin meetups across the world from 2017 onward. In Sydney, we've successfully reestablished regular Bitcoin only meetups where we run either casual drinks events or have speakers each month give Bitcoin related presentations. I won't say the events are huge, but they're growing in popularity even in this quieter phase of the market cycle.
