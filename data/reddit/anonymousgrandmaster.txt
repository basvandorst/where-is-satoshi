I am not satoshi.

This is not related to bitcoin but there are some who have made proposals for major (controversial) changes:
As stated in the bitcointalk thread when I posted the same link I am not Magnus although we have played multiple times.

Chess and bitcoin are a natural combination. Top players travel from country to country attending tournaments, often having to convert their appearance fees and prizes into another currency. Bitcoin can help streamline the process and make foreign transactions much easier. 
One step at a time. Having fun watching the FIDE World Chess Cup?
This is your chance to play one of its participants for free!

I agree it is said. Here is some recent context:

I will be happy to play multiple games! I have learned a lot about bitcoin from the bitcointalk community. Maybe I can give something back by introducing more people to chess

Ignoring transaction costs I think I addressed the issue. Top players travel to counties for tournaments and do not all prefer the same fiat currency. Some of us have trainers, etc that preferred to be paid in a fiat currency different from what is given to the players. Having bitcoin as an option would makes things easier for some. Foreign checks can sometimes take some time to clear.

I had to Google chopcoin. I am familiar with agar.io Like full ring poker games the game has an inherent flaw from a gambling perspective. Collusion is possible

Eventually I will reveal myself but I am not ready yet. I addressed some of my reasons in my bitcointalk thread along with clues to my identity. The number of people that I could be is not that large based on the information I have already provided. I am not selling anything so I don't really care if you believe me right now or not.

I wish all tournaments would accept bitcoin payments for registration fees and use bitcoin for prizes. It will be a very long time before that will happen
I am setting smaller goals for myself in hopes that others will follow by example. There are several players rated on 2700chess that are interested in bitcoin. If I can convince few more (key players) of its advantages I think we can make some headway with organizers agreeing to pay our appearance fees in bitcoin.

My bitcointalk post history addresses my opinion of using btc to build a chess related gambling site in more detail. I will just say that I am against it. Almost all games on lichess and other popular sites are played for free (I dont consider rating points the same thing as money) and cheating still exists. The cheating problem will be far worse when btc is at stake.

Assuming the site is honest heads up poker is relatively safe (since no collusion is possible as it would be in a full ring game). However limit poker has been mastered by bots: 
Eventually all major poker variants will be solved (to the extend where a top human cannot gain an edge on a computer) but this has not happened yet. Unlike chess where all information about a position is known, the element of chance in poker can complicate the programmers job.
There has been no debate in a long time about the superiority of computers to top chess players:

Cheating is an issue in live tournaments that organizers are paying more and more attention to. I know bitcoin gambling is a huge business online. It is just not going to work for chess.

Much depends on how long you have been playing and your current strengths and weaknesses.  Many people at your level will improve the fastest by spending a lot of time studying tactics.
Here is one free resource:
I think many people overvalue opening preparation. Of course it matters but from a time investment perspective it is unlikely to have the best ROI for you.
In the short run your results may be the best if you can become an expert in one opening. In the long run playing multiple openings (and being exposed to more types of positions) will be helpful even if you are not well prepared starting out.

Bitcoin transactions are definitely much faster than a correspondence chess game. I do enjoy blitz also.
