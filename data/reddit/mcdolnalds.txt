No it’s like a game of musical chairs and no one knows when the music is going to stop. 
Just for example, when bitcoin crashes, it has never crashed past its 100 day moving average. However it does settle to that average. Right now, the 100 day moving average is $5500. Almost half of the price of bitcoin right now.

Yeah I didn’t like having my initial invesment still in, I just wanted to take that out and leave the profits in to reduce stress

Joking right?

I know what you mean, what I would like to do is set up limit buy and sells. For example, if it passes down past $7750, it will sell, and if it goes down to $6k it will buy back in. Is this possible to do?

I’ve been holding in since 4800, and I just bought in more at 7700 because of the cancellation. I have high hopes for the future and predict growth over the next couple of days.

$250 trillion dollars is absolutely insane to even think about. I cannot put in that into perspective at all.

I can only figure it will skyrocket since I sold about half

The 100 day average of bitcoin is sitting around $5,500. There is definitely room for it to go lower.

Is it cheaper fees or just easier to use?

An issue I see tho is it takes bank transfers on Gemini. Would I have to wait 4-5 days to buy bitcoin and send it to someone?
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:30:31
The price is going back down anyways. rapidly

Haha I set a limit but at 5,500 and it won’t go down at all, I’m also pissed but I still have a lot of bitcoin making money rn
