Its not as rigged as I thought, if more people believe in them the value grows exponentially. If not, it sinks down to 0.

The lower the better the best time to buy it
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:34:09
I mean generally like, this period
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:47:16
Do you think its stuck in the dip
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:36:13
I dont even own Bitcoins. I am impartial to their outcome

Amazon will never feel secure unless you guys do

I know and I believe the future in Bitcoin could be dead if it is infact dominated by Unregulated bot trading
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:06:47
It cant be manipulated by any one particular person or group.
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:37:35
Still not a better time to invest than now
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:27:16
So it has no long term future, since it will not take off with that attitude.
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:07:11
If only you knew what you know now.
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:07:27
It wont get any better from here
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:45:22


It will go up if a lot of people are expecting it to go up an down if expected to go down.
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:06:27






Yah they dont tell you
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:07:47

@_date: 2018-06-11 15:33:45
So yeah its probably beat
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:56:05
It never does
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:56:24
I was lead to believe it was growing, not Dying.
@_date: 2018-06-11 01:24:04
I am. I really think you should.
Bitcoin is one of those things that will either take off really soon or expected to die forever
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:08:20
Who said it will ever pick up? If everyone doesn't buy and boom it it will stay an internet niche Investors side activity. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:47:09
Do you think its gonna never leave the dip?
