What type of alt coins are actually worth mining though? LiteCoin looks like it *could* be the next big thing, but I have absolutely no clue.

As a new investor who was planning on buying 800$ worth of BTC this Friday, while building a new rig devoted to LTC mining (trading for BTC whenever the price dips) would you recommend waiting until the bubble pops? Or try to get in now, sell the BTC in a few months before the bubble bursts when prices are (if) 1k+ (at the same time as trading the LTC for BTC)?

Now *this* was an informative and worth-while thread! Thank you, hcasaol.

Thank you so much for the insightful response! I will definitely invest in 800$ then and see what happens. I'm fairly new to high-risk markets (only have invested in low-risk mutual funds thus far) so I'm excited to see what happens.

I would like to expand on this just a bit: I'm also fairly new to BTC but *would* like to use them as an investment, similar to high-risk stocks. I'm not entirely sure where to begin though, should I devote a 2 week paycheck and just buy 8-10 and keep them secure to see what happens with the market? Should I mine BTC (or an altcoin like LiteCoin or the current highest priced alt)? Both? Neither? 
Any help would be greatly appreciated &lt;3

One (very basic) thing I'm trying to understand before investing in a couple BTC is the process to actually buy them. I imagine I create a wallet on blockchain.info, buy the bitcoin through *insert website here*, and then send the coins to either my hot wallet (blockchain) or a cold wallet?

You think your parents are going to give you 900+ dollars of Bitcoin for Christmas? Either you're exceptionally spoiled, rich family, or some combination of both. Unless you want like, 5 mBTC then sure I can see you getting that.

I have a bit of a miscellaneous question if you don't mind: would it be wise (or possible) to buy and sell BTCs through coinbase and linking your bank account, while when neither buying nor selling to keep the BTCs in your Electrum wallet?

As someone who has been waiting for a dip in price, this news has been very welcoming! Fall baby fall!

If you don't mind I want to see if I could take this farther: say you want to sell the Bitcoins in your Electrum software wallet. In order to do that you need to do some of the same steps you listed above, but you also need to have the address to your Electrum wallet (where your BTCs are stored)? Is this address the same address you used to buy the original BTCs from?

I'm sorry but I'm new to BTC. Could you explain what a hotwallet vs coldwallet is? 
@_date: 2013-10-29 21:36:02
Kill me. Just kill me. As someone who was going to put an entire 3k paycheck to Bitcoins in 2009 but decided it was too risky of an investment... just kill me. 
Edit: Kill me.

This is great info. Thank you!

Ty so much for the prompt response.. I had one additional question: I don't really trust my computer not to crash as I've been having some issues with it lately. Is there a hot wallet that you would recommend (or do you think I should leave the BTCs on coinbase)? I know a lot of people prefer cold wallets, but if I'm only going to be spending 600-800$ I don't feel like a coldwallet is necessary.

Ty so much!
