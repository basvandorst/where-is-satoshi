Can you explain how taxation is not theft please? Please focus just on this in your answer and nothing else.
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:03:48
Why do you expect that people criticizing the state want to live outside the society? There is no such implication as you put it. We are just saying we want to live without the state. Don't make ridiculous implications from that. 
We want to contribute to society and keep it functioning, just not based on thread and violence model just as you do. You want people to be forced to do something they don't want to do. We don't want that. That's all. So please, don't make such implications that we want something else.
You also say it as it was the only option. Well, it is the only option TODAY because there is the state that will force you with guns and army to do so. That's not OK for us. It may work for you, but who you are to force others to live like you want. We are not your slaves.

So do I with "taxation is not theft", for me that is something that people believed in the past. Some still believe that today, but hopefully it will change in the future and it will really be just the matter of past.


The results of the poll are always in the hand of who creates the questions. 


Yeah, if you want to believe those numbers ... So how do they calculate those numbers? So how about if I take your $100 and spend it all for $20 of a product that I then give it to you. I can certainly claim I gave you the exact value of what I took for you right? So you are definitely not being worse after the transaction. I honestly don't believe those numbers for many reasons and this is one of them.  But, even if it was a real number (which I truly believe it is not), it would not be justified for 80 % to steal from 20 %.
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:59:50


You were the one stating 


which is a completely idiotic argument. When slavery was OK, slaves were not treated as many people. The fact that it is weird to you TODAY does not change anything. 


I wasn't talking about slavery today, I was talking about taxation today vs. slavery before. You missed the point there.






This is true, but it is also true for slavery, so unless you accept slavery, it should not be an argument.


You are trying to prove that using false dilemas and misleading questions. The people asked those questions were not answering them in context of a choice of not paying taxes at all. But even that I have no problem if this was true that most people really wanted it. It still does not give the majority the right to force the minority into something.


Well it makes almost everyone worse, so this depends on how many is good enough. For you it is many and enough, for me it is not as many to justified the terrible wrongdoing.


This is 100 % false. Under taxation systems everyone is doing worse. Only very specific minority benefits and that is the minority who is paying less in taxes than they get in social support.  Only that group benefits, all others have net loss.
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:00:23
Oh is it? Definitely not more than your comment about taxes, which just claimed a bunch of untrue things without any actual reasoning. So maybe you now understand the point.

it didn't, but if you don't like ancap, minarchism is plausible solution, little inferior to ancap, but still tons better than the current state

Slavery has also a long history and helps many people and was pretty popular. And if we define that slaves are not people then most people wanted it. Then it also causes negligible harm to many people (unlike taxes).
The only thing that remains is reducing inequality, which is true, although all (except for a very small minority) participants end up with worse result.
So ... very good argument you have there. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:06:50
so we end up the conversation because you don't have arguments?
i said you can put there whatever you want, education, security, but make sure that something from that you want and something you don't. is it still not a theft then? 
so if i do not want to go to prison, your guys won't come with guns? they will, at least if you refuse to comply. not at first, but eventually, they will take it by force from you, that's just technical detail.
there is no social contract i signed or agreed with, so i guess you would be happy with me imaging random social contract that involves you and you are not happy with, or not?
every civilized society in the past was happy with slaves and raping. if this is ok argument for you ...
i'm certainly not interested in services provided by state, but that does not mean i would not be interested in the same services if they were provided by a company on a free market. the cost of having state is just too high for me to be ok with that exchange of my freedom and money for such services.
but the point is, if you want to have such a governance, that is your way of living and i'm in no position to tell you that you should do differently. i expect you to do the same. but no, you think you are smarter then everyone else and that people need to live just as you imagined. you think that they have to follow your "social contracts" just because. that's just sick.
if you were honest, you would ask everyone if they wanted to participate in such a contract. if they say no, you would leave them alone, not paying taxes and not use the services you provide. if you were little economical, you would then allow such people to pay for services they want to use just to make some extra money. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:16:03
Good list, but not the best reasoning, at least if you are for free market. There could be better compilation of reasons why those guys belong on the list.

@_date: 2018-01-14 13:38:43
So if I take your wallet on the street and find $200 in there and I take $100 from it and buy you a drink and a massage for it, it is no longer theft? Let's even consider I spend all those $100 and don't keep anything to myself.
There is no human systems without any flaws, but that does not mean taxation is justified.

No, it is not OK. Who says it is OK? When the state murders a man, that is OK. It is called "I am just a soldier and I just executed the order from my general." 


I fully agree with this. There is no reason to believe that.


Actually no. It would empower everyone in the society and give most power to people that are not lazy and want to build their own future instead of taking freebies from rich.


To me, such a claim is laughable. Governments subject to the rule of law? That is not the reality of today. If you throw THAT away, you have the ultimate force of free market and freedom.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:12:16

@_date: 2019-07-10 15:21:08
rare, extreme cases maybe, not in this context. the real difference he is that it would be bad if they steal from you, but it's ok if it is not from you. that's all and i guess you won't admit it's the case.
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:07:32
Not finding a wallet. I will find YOU on the street, take a gun, get your wallet from you by force and then buy you a drink. 
If you don't like drink and a massage, put anything else there. Put there a bread and butter and lots of stuff you don't want and don't need.
I don't believe in protection against monopolies. I believe in free market and free people doing whatever they want unless harming another person. 
You say that anyone is free to go somewhere else, except that 
- there are not many such "else" places on the planet
- what gives you the right to tell me to go away? how about you go away with your taxes?

In this scenario, the original argument is invalid because you're not trusting miners but the server of the vendor of the wallet. If the vendor is not a part of the takeover all its clients are okay. 
If the light wallet is using your own server, then again the original does not apply.
In case the light wallet is not configured to use a single vendor server, but rather it implements some kind of discovery, then my argument and question still holds.

Usually, when you make such adjustments, you introduce new vulnerabilities for the system. In your specific case, for example, you would allow malicious miner to quickly produce a series of blocks that are either empty or filled with very small transactions. So basically they can double spend for fractional cost than usual.
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:36:00
depends on who owns it and if they are willing to cooperate
@_date: 2019-07-10 14:07:38
no, we don't agree on basic things. i also reject theft, not only murder. calling things with different names does not change what they are. if you think that theft is no longer theft if i give you some of it back, then you could say murder is no longor murder if i feed children with the flesh... it does not work that way, still murder, still theft.
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:05:52
Why is light wallet security model equal to trusting miners? I'm hearing that from many people, but I still don't understand it. The argument is that in case of a malicious takeover, such as segwit2x, the light wallet cannot recognise which consensus rules its peers follow, so it's easy to imagine that the light wallet could be connected to segwit2x chain despite its wish to operate on bitcoin.
Okay, but the light wallet has some sort of mechanism of finding its peers - let's say it replicates discovery using seed nodes. Assuming that the seed nodes are not hijacked - there are not part of the takeover, they won't propagate nodes with invalid consensus, because such nodes would be banned from its network. Therefore the seed nodes would give you only IP addresses of nodes on the same consensus. How is then possible for your light wallet to connect to invalid chain?
Of course that the light wallet could have some cache of IP addresses from before and some of those IP addresses could be part of the takeover. But for such a case we can imagine a trivial feature of a light wallet to discard the cache in case of such an event. Of course this is not fool proof, but it kind of mitigate the argument. Or not?
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:23:49
Yes, wallet manages your keys and it tracks the history of your transactions. This you mentioned, the authoritative record is on the blockchain, so the coins themselves are there. The wallet only represents knowledge of keys with which you can control those coins.

@_date: 2019-07-03 10:26:36
But you are commenting on different topic now. Nowhere I am saying that light wallet security model is on par with full node. What I'm saying is that I don't understand the argument that light wallet security model is equal to trusting miners. Of course, in my scenario, I'm trusting seed nodes. So if my argument is valid then it's not true what people are saying because seed nodes are not miners.

light wallets typically are outbound only, so no issue there.
and yes, trusting devs (which you do anyway) is much less of an issue than trusting devs and miners, esp. if we've seen rogue miners in the past, but cant recall rogue seed node.

That's the point – there should not be mixed nodes within one network. Incompatible nodes will ban each other. Therefore if your seed nodes are on the correct chain, I can see how delightful it would discover takeover node. I already mentioned that my assumption is that the seed nodes are not compromised and part of the takeover.

How so? I see the difference in those being separated entities. Why this matter? Take Segwit2x for example. It would do nothing to such lightwallets. They even realized it and replaced all seed nodes with s2x seed nodes. So this distinction actually prevented light wallet takeover, should s2x be alive for longer.

This is hard to believe. The usual story that is much more believable is that the person lost the access to the keys before bitcoin became much more valuable. If this was the case, he did not lose 89 million worth of anything at any given time, maybe he lost 10,000 bucks worth of it maybe even less. And at that time he could just invest another 10,000 to get all back, which usually they wouldn't.  If he really had access to the keys while the value was 89 million andconly lost access then, that would be really different story, but it would be really really rare.

But if you think about it, not necessarily your anonymity set will be larger with Monero. It may happen that those who opt-in in Bitcoin for privacy will form a larger set than those who use Monero (once this feature is in Bitcoin). Or when the sets are +- of same size, you'd save on fees converting B-&gt;M and back M-&gt;B so Bitcoin would be better. It is kind of big IF, but ...

I think this is incorrect. If the anonymity sets of opt-in BTC and Monero are +- same, then you need exactly the same amount of explaining why you are using Monero as to why you are using opt-in BTC features.
So right now you are suspicious because you are using Monero. Common "why would you use it if you have nothing to hide" ... 
In other worse - what is the reason anyone would use Monero now? The only reason is the privacy. Therefore you are red-flagged just by using it now, but not more than if you use opt-in in BTC then, if those sets are +- equal.

It surely is, but it is the other way around. There was a big leap in adoption during the last 3 months and the curve of difficult increase is rather unchanged. The higher price only allows more miners to be profitable or join the game. It does not mean that if the price is higher if more users are using bitcoin that you need increased security and a higher consumption of electricity or invention of better machines. There is no such implication. The system security is separated from number of users using that system. So you are perfectly allowed to double the number of users or triple it or quadruple it and stay with the same security as you have now. In reality however it is likely that if you quadruple the number of users the price will go up which will allow more miners to be profitable and therefore is the side-effect of that you get and that with high net to consumption, but that is how the market works, and the side-effect of that will be that the network is more secure again. But then another side-effect is that it will become possible to research new hardware, so the energy consumption will be lower again for the same level of security

They usually request the Fiat equivalent. So yes, when the price goes down, I pay more than yesterday and and the price goes up, I pay less than yesterday. But those two just cancel out in long-term unless there is a long-term trend of price going up or down. And so far the trend in the real long-term is rather up, so overall the trend is beneficial to me, but only slightly and it is not a major factor for me.

It has absolutely nothing to do with scalability. Scalability is about how many resources you need to add when you on-board more users. Bitcoin's power consumption is not depending on that. The same level of bitcoin's power consumption you conserve one user as well as many users and there is no change in the consumption.

It only depends on how much the price would rise after the bcash fiasco is  removed from the earth. So potentially it be even more profitable for the attacking pool.

But the security of the bitcoin would be better
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:32:06
Okay, with such a definition of bitcoin user, it starts to make sense.It is probably not the best definition though, because many people out there are using wallets that do not do full validation. Then the question would be who are those people? How do we call them?

In the context of the whole letter, I think he only criticised some of the miners, not even all the miners that are currently there,  and I can't see him proposing a system completely without miners. He is rather proposing a system with new kind of miners, but still very much miners. So I'm quite confident to say that getting rid of miners here means getting rid of those evil miners. That is mostly because he's quite specific in the hostile actions of the miners and that applies only to some of them. And also because he is not proposing system without miners, so if it was meant for all miners and forever then he would simply contradict himself, which would not make much sense. But not saying that it makes much sense anyway
@_date: 2018-02-25 08:51:27
I disagree with Luke here. I love the guy and respect him very much, but I very much dislike doing hasty updates in bitcoin just because of some kind of fear. But I don't think this get any wider support, so no big deal, just little bit of unnecessary drama.

Price won't be the only factor, but it will be one of the major factors. Another factor would be level of regulation.

@_date: 2018-02-13 17:13:37
Yes, the 2nd one. Bitcoin is designed in a way that a block is mined every 10 minutes. This is an expected value that holds if the power of the network (hashing power) is unchanged. In practice, we can see new miners joining up the game, which makes the block time slightly below 10 minutes value. To compensate for that every 2016 blocks the difficulty of the bitcoin's puzzle is adjusted so that in the next period, it is expected again that the block will be mined in 10 minutes.
You can find the chart of bitcoin difficulty and its historic values so that you can see those adjustments in the difficulty of the puzzle over time. As you can see on the chart, the difficulty has risen many orders of magnitude. But due to the design the blocks are still expected to be mined every 10 minutes just as it was a year ago or 3 years ago.
Therefore more miners does not mean shorter confirmation time. Not in the long run, it is true only for that window of 2016 blocks, until the difficulty is adjusted again.
And vice versa - if some miners go out of the game, temporarily the blocks are mined slower and the difficulty will be lowered after the adjustment. This also happens from time to time.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:52:02

@_date: 2018-02-12 09:19:48
It is useful because it defines the level of security. An adversary has to produce similar amount of energy to be able to perform an attack. As an adversary has an orders of magnitude better hardware in terms of efficiency then this holds.
Everything is getting better and more efficient technology, this is especially true for mining hardware. If you wanted today to secure the network with CPUs or GPUs, your energy consumption at this level of security we have would be crazy.

@_date: 2018-02-12 11:14:02
The assumption is incorrect, the security we have now is completely independent of how many people will use the bitcoin. There is no linear increase, not even logarithmic, it is constant - simply the same level of security is achieved regardless on how many end users there will be
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:41:44
If you think mining is worthless then there is no point in further discussion, you enjoy your football and Christmas lights, let other people enjoy their bitcoin. The fact that I don't understand what people see in football doesn't make it worthless. The fact that bitcoin is worth something also suggest that you have no idea how important the mining is.
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:11:54
I think you both have reasonable arguments. It is very hard to predict what would be the reality if such a coin became popular. Maybe we would really see some weird space ASICs constructions, But I don't think anyone can say now
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:50:49
There are one way implications not equivalences. You still seem to have it the other way around.
The research is very much in progress everything that in the past that every so often there is an improvement in mining hardware. Recently there were news that bigger and bigger companies are interested in the mining business and creating their own chips. So it can be expected that unless bitcoin dies we will see improvements in hardware in the foreseeable future. However, if the price goes down significantly this won't happen. I'm not even sure that your last sentence holds. If you consider a miner who is forced to quit the business because of the low price, it might be quite unlikely that this cheap for them to jump back when the price is back. This may hold for some small operations like garaged miners just have couple of machines that they can turn on and off any time with no special cost, but that's probably not very interesting in terms of energy consumption spike

It's not wrong if you consider the Script in Bitcoin gives you just enough expressivness to verify the witness is correct. When you have a large program, for the specific input you only go through single branch of the program, which you can prove. Repeating the whole computation is inefficient. This gives you different way of doing things if you want to do them on Bitcoin vs Ethereum. On Ethereum, you put the code on chain and you execute on chain. In Bitcoin, you put your computation of chain and you only put proof of final result on chain.
@_date: 2019-09-23 06:30:52
Every node has to process every transaction. That's called linear scaling. It means that it does not scale as you have more txs in the system. TPS does not matter if every node has to process it. See EOS. It has 5TB of data to sync. No one can sync that except for few master computers. Thus it's not trustless nor decentralized. Same Nano. It does not scale. That's like saying Bcash scales... it does not. Just increasing TPS naively is not scaling. LN is what scales. Why? Because not every transaction needs to be seen by every node.

Go to whitepaper, it clearly says " Nano network has processed 4.2 million transactions with an unpruned ledger size of only 1.7GB". This gives you 435 bytes per tx. Go to  and  calculate that Bitcoin has 553 bytes per tx. So nano is just 21% better, which is asymptomatically the same. Just because the scammers are using fancy new names it does not mean there is something new. Just imagine if in Nano you used new account for every new receive. Sound like UTXO set now, huh? What is UTXO? Guess what... it's what you call "its own blockchain" - only owner can sign it. Just do the math instead of repeating what you heard.

It's a scam because it uses new words to describe old things, brings nothing new, does not scale, is centralized dPOS, but at the same time it claims it is trustless decentralized system, which is a lie. Bitcoin is not scam because people in Bitcoin are mostly honest about what can be achieved and what are the limitations. We do not claim that it scales if it does not. That would be dishonest and scammy. That's the difference. Your shitcoin's 1000s txs are nothing but mempool 0-conf equivalent, which Bitcoin can do as well, but no sane person claims it is finalized state that you can trust. Just stop with your dishonest shitcoin shilling.

wrong, Bitcoin has smart contracts since first versions. it does not have turing complete dumb contracts which are dumb because asking every node in the network to execute every instruction of a program is stupid instead of just checking the result is computed correctly, which is the way we do it in Bitcoin.

You DO need to verify everything, otherwise it's not trustless system. Guess what? Bitcoin also have pruned nodes. Does it mean that it scales? nope. 15GB is nothing? You joking right? So when you have 300m transactions it will be 150GB... now even you have to see that it does not scale better than Bitcoin. Obviously, because both scale linearly. So you kind of admitted that it does not scale, just pretending it does... are you part of the scam?

You don't understand what scaling means. It's not about TPS. If it was, Bcash would scale. Just increase block size for more TPS. That's not scaling. Just use a calculator for a second. You've got 0.5 kB per transaction. So you do let's say 1000 TPS. So 1 day has 86400 seconds. That's 86.4m txs. That's 40 GB per day or over 1 TB per month. Congratulations, you have disqualified 99% of people from participation in the network due to bandwidth and you have just 2-3 full nodes, all others need to prune. New clients fully trust those 3 computers and it takes about a month for them to sync. Great system.

This is possible because phone companies employ normal people who are not very security aware. When I needed to port my SIM, I did not have any ID. I went to the kiosk and asked for SIM porting service. They wanted ID. I said I didn't have one and they refused to proceed. I wasn't mad at them because they were doing it correctly. So I walked about 500 m to 2nd kiosk and asked for the service there. They wanted ID. I said I didn't have one and they started to ask some statistical questions about my service usage. I actually provided wrong information but they still completed the process for me because they wanted to be nice and I looked desperate. When people want to be nice to you instead of following security procedures it creates security hole in the system. 
Don't expect normal people to follow security procedures. It is well above their pay grade. This can only work if the IT system of the company does not allow the employee to proceed unless correct information is provided.

That's not it, lightning network use case is just one example. By itself it would be a sufficient argument, however. But if you want another argument – just consider the famous Mt. Gox. They actually lost pupils coins because of transaction malleability. This means that they implemented their system with some assumptions that were not true because the transactions were malleable. This implies that fixing malleability allows people to create simpler systems.

That is just misunderstanding. Smart contracts actually come from bitcoin. It means that the recipient of the payment can actually be more than just a simple address. It can be "smarter" script. This is used for many different use cases, for example lightning network. In some of these use cases, you actually need the property that  the transaction ID is not malleable, for example again in the current implementation and design of lightning network. What you do there is that you create a transaction, but you do not propagate it to the network, so it does not appear in a block. Then you create another transaction that depends on the first one. And only when the second transaction is successfully created, only then you propagate the first transaction. Such constructions are necessary to keep all involved parties secure in case of misbehaving of other parties.
@_date: 2018-12-26 08:20:24
