I think the idea is what that while Bitcoin will be useful for a certain group to accomplish their agenda, their taking advantage of Bitcoin's properties isn't necessarily good for Bitcoin itself.
Consider the PR nightmare the Slik Road was for Bitcoin.

I did.

I'm surprised it doesn't get more attention. Its unproven at this point, but the devs seem to know their stuff. If it works as advertised, it will be game changer for more than just cryptocurrency.

Yeah, the crowdsale was a huge fiasco. My impression was that it was incompetent more than unethical, but it is still a big blow to peoples confidence in the project.
That being said, their code is all open source. The devs are extremely responsive to questions on their forum. I haven't seen anyone who has actually looked at the code say it isn't legit.
If the team isn't competent enough to pull the project together, more talented devs will cannibalize the code and built something that works.
The central ideas are too brilliant to not pay attention to.

This is ironic considering one of Gates biggest focuses right now is bring water filtration systems to rural Africa.

But it also works as a mechanism for distributing newly created coins. Yes, it in part works kind of like a transaction fee in a traditional economic system, but it has enough difference that this reward / transaction volume = transaction fee meme is misleading.

So your predicating your price point on your ability to predict Bitcoin's price in the short term?

Its a very slowly popping bubble set into motion by the fraud of Mt Gox. We're now back in the range of pre-bubble prices, hence why people are expecting the worst of the decline is over.

I arrived in the thread after the exchange had already occurred. I think your capacity for inference is impaired.
@_date: 2015-01-25 06:27:07
Might I suggest using line breaks?
It makes things easier to read.

Not on topic regarding Bitcoin, but have you considered porting some of your work to VR? You would get a lot of love from for it.
@_date: 2015-01-18 23:36:45
Block reward is not a transaction fee though. Thats a false equivalency.
@_date: 2015-01-29 04:49:07
But if it will eventually rise to even $300, why is buying for $230 not a good idea?
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:09:01
Yes. Keep your coins in cold storage. The beauty of bitcoin is that you don't have to trust people to be able to keep your coins safe, which is exactly what you do if you leave them in an online wallet.

MaidSafe really doesn't have any overlap with all of the other "me too!" blockchain scams. Bitcoin is a perfectly fine implementation of blockchain. We don't need another one.
MaidSafe is a rather ambitious project. It is mainly a network protocol that works very much like Tor, but in an entirely decentralized way using what they claim is a sybil attack resistent DHT implementation instead of preventing sybil attacks with a centralized directory authority.
It isn't based on a traditional client-server model, instead using a dispersal algorithm to redundantly distribute encrypted chunks of data to different nodes. This solves the major weakness in Tor (i.e., correlation attacks), and also makes it much harder to steal or corrupt data.
The Safecoin currency built in is intended primarily to incentivise contributing resources to the network. Where it differs from Bitcoin is that instead of using a blockchain for transaction confirmation, it has a peer consensus model. This means full anonymity, instant confirmation, zero blockchain bloat, and essentially unlimited transaction volume.
Even if Safecoin never competes with Bitcoin as a primary currency, the network solves a lot of logistical issues with Bitcoin such as securing wallets, hosting bloated blockchains, etc.
Obviously the system is enormously ambitious. Even relatively minor features of the network would be groundbreaking.
We'll have to wait a few months to see how well their network holds up the stress test of being live on the Internet.

What is your reasoning? Why is a Bitcoin worth $180 but not $230?
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:41:03
Which part are you talking about? 
I think the main data encryption is AES256, which is about as non-experimental as it gets.
The peer consensus mechanism is pretty wild though, and is definitely experimental.

That wasn't my interpretation of his post.
I think he is referencing the trolls constantly claiming that is an echo chamber because of its strong pro-bitcoin sentiment.
@_date: 2015-02-14 18:38:11
Yes, that was the point of my comment.
@_date: 2015-02-14 06:48:09
By that reasoning, shouldn't copper be outrageously expensive? Maybe you should skim the Wikipedia article on supply and demand.
