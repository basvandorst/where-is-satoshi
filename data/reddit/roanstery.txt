From what I'm reading, you seem overconfident that the site will ever relaunch.  I hope I'm wrong about this. It's the best thing for all of us here if Bitfinex is not insolvent and returns at some point soon.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:50:27
Dude,ETC is the only crypto coin that is not tanking right now.  If I were you, I would make an acct on Bitmex really quick and when you are ready to sell your ETC just short the equivalent amount on Bitmex.  That way you protect and save your profits.
@_date: 2016-08-21 03:59:33
You may want see a neurologist about that memory.
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:26:37
Yes very, very possible if not probable.
@_date: 2016-08-21 01:32:43
Wrong but no reason to argue about it when anyone can look at a chart.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:03:57
That sounds like a good sign if you are even going to be in any position to address customer losses.  That implies that Bitfinex will survive and not go into insolvency and bankruptcy.
Were Bitcoin deposits on your site legally the properly of the account holder or Bitfinex?   I'm trying to ask were the funds stolen from the account holder or from Bitfinex?    I'm not sure if that makes sense but just trying to figure out the odds of you surviving this and me getting my USD balance back.
@_date: 2016-08-05 03:24:28
yes you can track it, but doesn't mean you can get to it or learn who controls that particular address.
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:52:44
Yes well I wrote that when they were still well over .005.  I saw that it dipped and yes that hurts.  Just hope you get back 100% of your ETC.  That's what counts the most at this point, but of course maybe not if it dropped a bunch from here.
@_date: 2016-08-08 02:59:04
Not surprising.  They lie to us about their security, then they lose $72 million of our money and they take zero responsibility and no concrete efforts to repay any of it.
@_date: 2016-08-21 03:58:31
You can't be serious.  Price before the hack was also $100, $1100, $0.25, and $12.00. Also Bitcoin didn't exist before the hack.  Also, dinosaurs walked the earth before the hack.
I hope you are just trolling or I truly pity you.
@_date: 2016-08-01 15:53:27
Blockchain.info is terrible.  An error on their site cost me $5000 USD.
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:56:37
Your math is way off.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:57:57
Your BTC is still there, but if Finex is not, then we are all screwed.  Meaning that they end up out of business and insolvent after this, it will basically be Gox 2.0.  And I really really hope that is not the case, for my sake and for yours. but not looking great.
@_date: 2016-08-08 04:19:25
@_date: 2016-08-21 00:35:59
Price was too high so now it's at a better level. Without the Bitfinex hack, it would be this same level anyway. It was 604 before the hack.
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:04:47
$5m sounds very low estimate.
@_date: 2016-08-01 17:41:21
I transferred funds to a new Blockchain.info wallet address.  Blockchain.info said that I had the $5000 worth of BTC in there.  It showed the balance.  So I log out and back in a couple of hours later and the balance is 0.0.  I contacted them and they said somehow it didn't sync with my computer or something and the address private key wasn't saved on their site.  So the $5K worth of BTC are lost at that address and no way to get the private key. And they also basically said tough luck.
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:37:57
You didn't do anything wrong.  You could have bought BTC over 3 years ago and you would still be down and lost money on your investment.  If you bought Amazon or Facebook three years ago, you would be way up.
@_date: 2017-02-22 23:04:27
So they'll just ban Bitcoin overall and really show you guys.
@_date: 2017-02-03 00:02:24
What about three years ago?    
That's what I thought.
@_date: 2017-02-23 09:37:17
It is a "concern" to the people who have used Purse.io and had police show up on their doorstep.
I wasn't speaking hypothetically.
And no it wouldn't happen to anyone with a public Amazon wishlist...what a goofy thing to say.
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:37:26
And why would you be buying anything for me...out of the goodness of your heart?    I can guarantee you that if I made my wishlist public, no one would magically buy anything for me, regardless of whether they used stolen credit card or not.
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:18:26
You guys are really desperate if you are going to celebrate this.  
Wake me up with at least new ATH and preferably up 20% since early 2014.  Stock market has done better than that.
@_date: 2017-02-22 07:24:41
It took three years, because the US gov't woudn't give up the gold, because they probably spent/sold a lot of it in the past and had to scramble to replace it or at least shore up other reserves.

You are so arrogant in your ignorance and stupidity.
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:19:28
You said that in Jan 2014 but never posted in Jan 2015.  I wonder why.
@_date: 2017-02-22 23:05:34
Or maybe it's because that it's illegal on the federal level and no banks can do business with pot dealers/retailers, as a result.
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:43:10
Not really.   You guys are always bragging about what you can buy with BTC, so he can just do that.
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:38:55
A credit card that is stolen...pretty simple.  Most of the time people just steal the numbers though and someone buys them on the Dark Net.
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:18:54
Sounds like a great fantasy.
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:36:18
That too.
@_date: 2017-02-23 07:18:42
Yes it can backfire if the police show up at your door, because the item was bought with stolen credit card.
@_date: 2017-02-22 20:12:54
So many dumb people on here who are so confident in their stupidity.
@_date: 2017-02-03 03:41:20
Please stay on topic.  The US stock market performed much better than 25% over the past three years.  You would have been better off with your money in stocks for the past three years...or of course some altcoins that increased about 500% or more in that time.  
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:50:48
Interesting, but doesn't really list any of the advantages of Gold over Bitcoin, which are numerous.

Because you aren't a moron who wants all of his eggs in one basket.  Smart people are always adjusting their asset allocation, based on changing conditions.
@_date: 2017-03-04 10:52:11
It makes sense because Bitcoin is an asset and an asset is part of wealth.
@_date: 2016-06-05 08:18:47
This article is old, but probably even more true today and just a reminder of how the gov't discourages using cash, relatively high value bills.
@_date: 2016-06-24 10:19:57
Yes exactly.  It's speculation and manipulation...nothing ore. Of course BTC usage is probably increasing SLOWLY but that doesn't justify a doubling of the price in a few months. We just dropped $230 and it wasn't because the Chinese are racing to put their money in Bitcoin to evade capital controls.
@_date: 2016-06-19 15:24:41
Of course they are in it for the money.  And they are up about 2000% in the last several months.   
And BTC permabulls are the Kings of the Bagholders.  They held from $1100 to $170.
@_date: 2016-06-19 15:14:40
They already can.  The miners control the network and I'm sure they can be contacted.  And BTC mining has become extremely centralized and probably some collusion going on as well.
@_date: 2017-01-31 18:41:15
Bitcoin permabulls are so desperate.  They will take every bit of news and claim it will cause the BTC price to rocket upwards.  The price is lower than it was 3 years ago...wake up.
@_date: 2017-01-23 16:43:20
Yep.  people conveniently downplay that.  "You cant kill Bitcoin!" they say but the price can be rekt and anyone holding BTC will lose a whole lot of money and spending power.
@_date: 2017-01-22 19:30:18
Someone has to be paid to make those pennies.  So that is more money taken from the citizenry and given to some company and its owners.  So don't expect the penny to disappear anytime soon.

If you read what happened with their arrest, it wasn't "shady at all".  You must be a Trump voter who thinks law enforcement is always 100% justified whenever they arrest someone.

Yes Paxful is just like LBC, but just less focus on in person cash transactions.  But it's legit and has been around for about 18 months or longer now.  They have good customer service and admins.

No one cares about falling behind in your imaginary, futuristic, in 50 years, Bitcoincentric economy...that doesn't exist and probably never will be.  Some gov'ts have already made Bitcoin illegal and most likely, more will follow.
@_date: 2016-11-04 05:18:37
It really doesn't make any sense at all whatsoever, but I sold BTC when I heard this news and it paid off for me with some extra profits.  But it's obviously impossible to stop BTC from traveling across borders because people can use brain wallets or paper wallets or many other solutions and move their BTC wherever they want at will.   Actually the BTC doesn't even move to a geographic location to begin with.  It is present on every copy of the blockchain, all over the world  The best they could do is make it more difficult for people in China to convert BTC to fiat.   It's already illegal there to buy anything with BTC.
@_date: 2016-11-05 02:09:50


Again, I disagree for the reasons I stated. You seem to be backpeddling so have fun with that and trying to figure out what you actually believe.
@_date: 2016-11-04 05:12:57
Good job.  Smart man and that's the way to do it.   Others here will not admit that they were not smart to take some profits up there.  You have more money than you did before and they have less money than they did..bottom line.
@_date: 2016-11-05 02:08:13
Of course an index fund of 100+ altcoins would not work.  The overwhelming majority are pump and dump, or just fall out of favor in time, at the very least.  There are only a small handful that hold their value.
I love daytrading alts, but I sure don't hold them that long in most cases and I jump from one to another frequently.  That's the way to maximize your profits.  I guess Bitcoiners just love to HODL, no matter what but does not work with 99% of the alts.
@_date: 2016-12-03 16:13:51
This is scary and I would have said at least we don't have to deal with this in the USA...but...Trump was elected and fascism is on the rise and all bets are off the table.
@_date: 2016-12-14 19:28:16
OMG - 15 cents !  Yes that is a deal killer for sure.
@_date: 2016-12-14 19:13:32
What do you mean by "worthless"?  Worth $0.0000 in per BTC in one day?  There aren't any scenarios like that.
But there are multiple that would bring value of 1 BTC below $100 in a day.
Biggest one is quantum computing or other way to break the encryption of BTC.  Yes could be forked to better encryption scheme perhaps, but the damage would have been done after so many people had their money stolen.
Other is of course increased gov't regulation...making it next to impossible to use BTC or exchange it for fiat. Or just imprisoning anyone caught holding or transacting in BTC.
The morons here will say "Big deal if you imprison people who use BTC...you can't kill Bitcoin".  They are clueless and I will assume you don't have that same attitude.
A question is how much would 1 BTC be worth if you could only use it for illegal activities...because every current legal use of it had been made illegal.
And don't think this can't/won't happen. It only takes a terrorist attack using BTC as even a small part of it and the general public will be fine with Bitcoin being banned/made illegal.  And of course that attack can be a false flag attack.
@_date: 2016-12-14 23:58:46
Source is news on the Internet that's been posted multiple times over the past few years.  Unless there is a conspiracy to mislead, I assume that the news stories were true.
You can easily google any or all of those if you want a specific source. I wouldn't say definitely trust a random person either, but the truth is there.
@_date: 2016-12-14 19:18:35
Bitcoiners think BTC price will stay at $700 when this happens.  They are fools.
@_date: 2016-12-15 04:12:57
The gov't fixes the official exchange rate, but that doesn't affect the black market exchange rate, which most people probably use there.
@_date: 2016-11-04 05:15:40
Yes you do get cashed out at the mark price at that point.  It should be close to your P&amp;L price. It's often good to manually close out your position before the end though...you have more control and sometimes get a better price than having it done automatically.  Plus some exchanges charge an extra fee at the end if you don't close it.  I'm not sure about OKCoin. I use BitMEX.
@_date: 2016-11-04 08:37:00


You are so clueless but perhaps better to stay that way, in this case.
@_date: 2016-12-14 19:23:48
Changing Bolivars to USD or EUR is probably safer, but if can't do that or rate is too high, then BTC is good as well.
@_date: 2016-11-04 05:20:43
Bitfinex sucks, but thanks for sharing this article and the info.  And agreed that this news, in and of itself, is not going to hurt Bitcoin usage much.  But where there's smoke, there is sometimes fire and that is the concern.
@_date: 2016-11-04 05:07:41
Go back to when the price as $900 and you heard people talking about "cheap coins" constantly...all the way down to $200.
And of course there are multiple possibilities for BTC's future direction...up and down.  
And who cares about "long-term" anyway. If you sold the China news and bought back, you have more Bitcoin...more money, than you did before.
If you stubbornly held through it, then you have less money than you did before.  The Bitcoin price in 10 years will never change that.
@_date: 2016-12-14 19:16:42
Yes..Haha...can just walk around the fence...and Bitcoin price will be below $100...and I'll go to prison if caught walking around the fence. 
No big deal.

I never thought I was a genius. I think that you are an idiot and I am of average intelligence. And I am correct about that.
@_date: 2016-11-04 05:11:53
You did lose.  Your BTC has less buying power than before the news came out and also you could have sold when the news came out and bought back more BTC when it dropped.  So you are a loser in this case, no matter how you look at it.
I suppose those who held fiat USD since 1908 haven't "lost" anything even though their dollars can buy 2% of what they did back then?   You are clueless about the purpose of money.
@_date: 2016-12-14 17:57:23
Already morons are editing it and putting "Bitcoin and dogecoin" or "Bitcoin and ethererum".
It shouldn't list any specific currencies..maybe "cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin", considering it's the clearly leader, but that's it.
@_date: 2016-11-04 18:56:29


Nope I sold because of bad news, which was far from "luck". I suppose the people who sold when they heard Mt Gox was bankrupt were lucky too when the price fell $100 in seconds.  Yes you definitely need to avoid daytrading. You would lose all your money for sure.
@_date: 2016-12-14 19:20:36
Yes of course there has been. It has been illegal to buy anything with Bitcoin in China for years.  Businesses are banned from taking it.  Which means if you do so, you get fined and/or go to jail.
Also has been illegal in Russia, and Germany (Localbitcoins banned there) and US States, NY and NC.  It isn't illegal to hold BTC in these areas, just to use it in most cases.
And it's only going to get worse over time..you can bet on that.
@_date: 2016-11-05 20:43:37
Most people don't care.  They don't have businesses that need Paypal.  I wasn't acutely aware of all of this until I got into crypto.  Although Paypal froze one of my accts for B.S. reasons, so I get why people hate them so much.
@_date: 2016-11-04 18:57:40
If you have to hold or you will get ulcers, then yes I guess hold. But others aren't as fragile as you are and we like having more money in the end.

I thought India was bad with pulling their notes worth $15.00.   100 bolivar note is worth $0.02.
@_date: 2016-11-04 18:58:33
If you think price moves are 100% unpredictable 100% of the time, then yes you definitely want to hold.  You wouldn't want to sell when Gox goes bankrupt and you wouldn't want to buy when you heard the ETF was approved. Because only random movements after those, right?
@_date: 2016-10-27 04:13:51
However, as bitcoin continues to grow, eventually, more and more people are going to skip fiat all together.
Maybe this will happen in 20 years, but not anytime soon.  Consumer use of Bitcoin is experiencing almost no growth right not..may negative growth if you don't count illegal dark markets.  Most people own it for speculation/investment and not to use as you are talking about.
@_date: 2016-07-07 06:55:32
Yes it sounds like a good risk to take.  But make sure you have a good way to sell your BTC in Mexico. If you don't need it all at once, you could sell it slowly through LBC although that can be dangerous and mexico sounds extra dangerous.

@_date: 2016-07-26 09:48:09
12 to 15 is 20% increase.  So you don't consider that a significant rise?   That would be about $170 at today's prices.
But you don't consider that "significant".
Plus we just had 200% increase in the past year.  Price already shot up like a rocket to bubble type levels.
