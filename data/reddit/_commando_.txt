Please fix "block chain database needs to be re-indexed".
Sick of re-indexing 40 GB's worth of fkn data that takes 6 hours + and during this 6+ hours CPU usage 60~80%.
@_date: 2015-06-06 00:20:35
Yup running 10.2
I've lost count of the number of total times I've had to rebuild the index.
But the trigger that causes it is as simple as a power cut while bitcoin core is downloading blocks.   Or the application crashes, and on next start up it can't verify the blocks and needs to re-index, which is really re-downloading the block data not re-indexing what's already on the HDD.   I also run 2x 512GB SSD's in RAID 0.
I've decided to completely delete all 40~ GB's worth of data and start fresh with 11.0
It's been 12 hours and still going though the process.  Approx 36 weeks of blocks left to download.
I've never had to re-index the block data on 8.6 and pre 10.0.  Ever since I've updated to 10.0+ This has been a headache.  If this isn't fixed in the long run I will have no option but to stop using the core bitclient, which means I wont be able to support the network.  :(

Sorry dude but "good old days of cheap coins"? What old days are you talking about? Leaving December aside cryptos never were so expensive like today. Just wanted to let you know that cryptos exist since almost a decade ago and cheap coins will never come back.
The reason why Crypto / USD is so expensive is due to the unlimited USD printing and monetary policy.  usdebtclock.org
You're already over 21.15 trillion in debt with no sign of stopping, if anything the compounding interest on the debt is reaching to a point where you cannot pay it back (top of the pyramid) then hyper inflation will start, then hyper deflation and the great depression that occured in 1920's will look like nothing compared to what is coming for the USD and it's economy.
The USD paper dollars are not worth the ink and paper it's printed on.  The illusion of worth in the USD is just based on a belief and that belief is slowly dying away.   Countries have realized this endless uncontrolled money printing by the Federal Reserve (which is not federal by the way, it's a private bank) and have stopped trading using USD's as the internationally reserve currency and instead are using their own national currencies Ie Russia, China, India, Iran, etc.
Let that sink in for a moment.
Now, back to the point.  The reason why crypto currencies are going up in value over a length of time is do the the real fact and reality of the USD actually decreasing in value.
@_date: 2016-12-23 02:45:52
The exact same thing the USA has been doing sing the 50s with its debt cieling and uncontrolled free money printing without any consequences because its too big to fail excuse.  The time will come when the USA will fail its obligations to repay its debt.  Increasing your credit card limit to pay off your other credit card will only help so many times.

in 2020, Miners wont be getting 1,800 BTC mined per day.   They will get a fraction of the total number of transactions in BTC, mined back to them as fees.
So your estimate is wrong.

Ideal economy would have 0% inflation or deflation, but the bankers don't want that otherwise how else are they going to steal money from you over the years so they pressure the govt to increase inflation.

Yep, and 10,000 BTC pizza started it all.

If all these businesses that want to use their OWN block chain, it is no different to their current monetary system.  It's just virtual numbers on an account THEY control.
The whole purpose and design of BITCOIN is decentralization.
Private block chains are centralized.

I prefer no inflation or deflation.

Bitcoin is against the current monetary system of the unlimited money printing press, which the bankers support.
In short bitcoin is against bankers.
Bankers are for a "block chain" they want to control and are against bitcoin.

The whole world knows that paper money is IOUs.  And no the IOUs are not backed by gold as were not on a gold standard and haven't been for a very long time.
There's hundreds of good quality videos out on YouTube that explain this.  One more recently that I recall is published by Mike Maloney.

If price right now is 500 usd per BTC, on halving it will be double.  As long as demand is exactly the same however the supply has halved.
@_date: 2016-05-09 02:29:29
idea that anyone may be Satoshi is an argument for debate.  The real truth is providing real evidence for such a claim.

28% of American's have heard of Russia via CNN and other propaganda news networks and how bad Russia is but they don't know where Russia is on the World Atlas.
You'll find that more than 80% of Russian's know more about bitcoin than your avg american.   I'm not sure what the point of this survey was or who had access to it in order to participate.

Nice try.

Genesis Mining scammed me out of the lifetime contract after several months of running.
Their payouts are also not transparrent and I believe they have no mining equipment what so ever.  They are a PONZI pyramid payout scheme.
The money you paid for the contract will be paid back to you at the small daily payouts (drip fed) back.
