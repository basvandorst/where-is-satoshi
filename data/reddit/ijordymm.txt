Theoretically it is inevitable for Bitcoin to hit at least $100,000 in the next 5 years.   
Bitcoin has one of the most loyal communities in the economic scene. This community is growing daily. The community is however not big enough yet to tackle price drops, but eventually it will be so big that it will hold a certain amount of the market which will decrease the amount of bitcoin in circulation significantly. Since they will simply not sell. This will boost the price of bitcoin significantly. Remember fiat, bitcoin, crypto any currency is worth what people believe that it is worth. The people that believe bitcoin is worth 100s of thousands is growing by the day, so people won't sell before it hits that and once it hits it people will get even more optimistic and still hold. The key here is loyalty. This in combination with the fixed supply will inevitably lead to a steady price increase in the next couple of years. Eventually the amount of available bitcoin will be so low that people will bid up the prices just to not FOMO or because they realize that bitcoin right now is the only solid strategy to preserve wealth in our current economic theater. Just look at Chile, Argentina, Iran, Hong Kong, Italy, Catalonia, France.. It's only a matter of time till whatever (social) challenge is going to create more chaos in our societies and economies. Either climate change, or imigration or the CB's retarded monetary policies or the growing China, Russia dominance.. Pick one.    
The only thing that makes me wonder is how miners are going to get by if bitcoin is primarily held for wealth preservance and not for actual transactions (or very few in that sense). What will their business model be then? If the halving are over and transactions will simply not be abundant enough.
