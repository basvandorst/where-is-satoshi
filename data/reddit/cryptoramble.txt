Ha :) maybe
@_date: 2019-07-29 18:38:47
Lol. I could have actually done that as I have a shredder handy.

How else would competitors reach anywhere though? Plus it's like the child learning that they can't play with fire. You can give guides but ultimately they might have to learn for themselves.

Yeah that post about bank bailouts seemed to ignore that bitcoin solves the issue with just how the banking process itself has always worked not even considering state intervention. I suppose they are both about centralized power.

Yeah I really want to complain about this. The video discussion centers around Bitcoin since Tone is a BTC maximalist. I really only posted it here because I thought it relevant. And I would love to repost it with a different title but I'm not sure what to do now. People here are so touchy and assume the worst of others.

It's built on Bitcoin

I hope this is actually effective

No it was a genuine question. And like I said I think it also belongs here

What would you suggest titling it? The crypto space is very tribalistic. Really the video relates to just crypto in general, including Bitcoin. And altcoins too. Bitcoin is talked about a lot. I just picked my favorite quote. It's not in context but I can't make others watch it to find the context

I know you're going off of the title, but it's a little more nuanced than that. If you still feel similarly after watching the video, then I'd be interested in hearing your opinion then.

Thanks for watching! (assuming you watched)
@_date: 2019-12-08 23:10:14
Thank you. I'll reconsider that
@_date: 2018-11-18 01:16:02
Will keep in mind.

 "On the edge of" is fairly ambiguous. What time scale are we talking about here? The article's author was just excited about the technology \(lightning network\) making it easier for bitcoin to scale and mass adoption to happen.

I just read something in it that had an obvious typo. That's okay, just surprised no one cared. How standards have fallen.

I always find it interesting when I see terms like 'hack' and when you can't find anything good to say about someone. Figures tend to be much more nuanced than that, imho.
