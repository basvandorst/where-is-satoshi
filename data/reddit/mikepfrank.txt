It's not a great idea to post even just the public key, since if quantum computers are developed someday, they can crack the ECDSA signature system and steal those coins.  Best to resend that Bitcoin to a fresh address, and don't ever spend from it more than once.

How do you handle Bitcoins used to purchase goods/services?  Technically one should pay capital gains on the appreciation based on the market value of items received, as in a barter transaction...  And it also affects the LIFO accounting.

Because miners spent real resources (operating costs) to mine those coins, this will generally put a floor on the price that they are willing to sell them for.  If the price is too low, a miner who isn't at the edge of bankruptcy might just hold their coins hoping for the price to go higher.  In this way, high mining difficulty helps to prop up the bitcoin price to some extent.  So this tends to support OP's point.

Also... Do you correct for the differing time zones used by different exchanges when processing date/time data?

I think Bitstamp and Coinbase display in different time zones

I paid for a $150 / 0.9021 BTC gift card earlier this morning, my transaction has 12 confirmations now, but the gift card has yet to show up in my wallet!  I agree with the poster who said that you should really give a warning on your website about the time to process purchases.

How about this?  "Nation of Bitcoin" / Logo / "Vires in Numeris"

I also had a problem at CVS, but the next time it worked fine.  I think maybe the problem the first time was, the clerk wasn't bright enough to hit the "Gift Card" key on the register before attempting to scan the code.  :)

It finally shows up in the online wallet now, after a couple of hours...

FYI, my small, local credit union has no trouble with international wires.

My 2nd attempt, a $50 CVS gift card, was received right away, and sending it to my phone worked immediately as well (with the earlier Wal-Mart card I had to add it to my phone manually).

OK, I finally found a link to it in my email, but it still doesn't appear in the "My Wallet" page on your website.  The email arrived quickly though, within 1 minute after the Bitcoin transaction was sent, so that part is good.

It was accepted at Wal-Mart, although for some reason scanning the barcode on both my phone and my printout didn't work; the clerk had to manually punch in the numbers and the manager had to key an override.
