Best thing you can do for your mental health is not read any bitcoin-related shit for the next six months.
By that time, it's either gonna be many times what it is now or worth nothing. Either way you'll be fine.

that's a great question, not sure if this is a wallet service or just an exchange for buying and selling cryptos where they have custody

Switch to LN then back to BTC?

I hear you on that. I wish the Core ideology didn't have to be so rigid against going to a 2MB blocksize. 
It doesn't have to be a "slippery slope" to unlimited blocksize, but would be a nice bandaid until these long-awaited off-chain solutions are ready for prime time.

what does the "transaction limit" function do? Is that the amount you can send without 2FA?
Also, let's say greenwallet is on my ios device. Is it stupid to have SMS/Email authentication if the sms goes to that same device and the email account is accessible from the same one as well? 
In that case, would it better do just have one type of 2fa enabled? Thx for humoring the noob questions

you don't think it'll crash after the 2x fork?

Good for you. Don't beat yourself up for not buying more back then, be happy you bought what you did
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:36:50
How long do you think that will take? I have only 1 confirmation after 7 hours
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:43:51
that's what I don't understand here. People with a vested interest in bitcoin's success keep trying to sabatoge it before LN, Schnoor, etc. have a chance to be fully implemented. 
edit: can't we all just get rich and be happy? 
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:31:26
Awesome, thanks this is incredible to witness. Like handing a Ferrari to a chariot driver.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:15:10
The only thing I disagree with you on is the power of institutional money moving into bitcoin. I don't think it can be underestimated how much the price will increase when pension funds and banks start buying BTC.
If we can make it through the 2x battle without another fork I think Bitcoin will end 2017 at $10k+
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:50:53

well that's the choice that they make, i'm not saying I would do anything differently in that situation but luckily I didn't have to. It's the same choice the Founding Fathers made in 1776, risking everything in order to have individual sovereignty.

I agree with you 100% but take exception when we talk about 401k's and pension funds that are impossible to put Bitcoin into.
I think we SERIOUSLY underestimate the impact of every pension fund manager in America putting 1% of a fund's worth into a bitcoin-backed security. Moon launch would be swift

It's a futures market, the instruments you're buying are redeemable for the actual crypto after the fork. Basically the market is currently saying one s2x will be worth 1/5th of a bitcoin after the fork happens.
