So where is the compound and how soon can I send my nubile teen daughters to lie with master Satoshi?

This made me lol. NPR's pro-establishment, neoliberal bias is well established.

Underwritten, UNDERWRITTEN! If they say "find out more information" instead of "buy our product" then it's technically not an advertisement!

This article is really unhelpful. FinCEN, to their credit, clarified that AML/KYC does not apply to the maintainers of a distributed currency. Only groups that can directly control the issue of currency would are subject to FinCEN AML/KYC - e.g. Amazon coins, etc. The author is purposefully or ignorantly conflating the regulatory category of an "administrator" to cast uncertainty upon Classic. No bueno.

It doesn't matter whether they would be creating a new currency or not. From the perspective of FinCEN, regulation is triggered by centralized issuance. Developers of a distributed system of issue are not required to register as an MSB. Miners would be unlikely to face civil liability for mining on the longest chain post-fork. (Exchanges, however, could face risks if they botch handling customer funds through the transition, but the author doesn't really discuss this.) This article is confused and unhelpful.

The trigger for AML/KYC is centralization of issuance, not any fork per se. Or did you mean something else?

Forking software =/= forcing a contentious hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain.

That's not relevant. This article does not discuss the use category that would need to apply for the argument to make sense: that of an "administrator." This would be any person or group who has sole discretion to issue new digital currency units. Developers of distributed currencies - whether Classic or Core - do not qualify. Only operators of centralized digital systems such as Amazon coins would be beholden to AML/KYC.
This is a poorly reasoned argument and a disappointing rhetorical tact.
