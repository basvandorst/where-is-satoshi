Did you find a bank in the end ?

Any idea how I can check this? I sent the coins from my cex.io wallet so not sure what fees they’ve included 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:49:34
How do we Cpfp? The fee was not decided by me, it was decided by cex.io where I bought the coins.

Sent from cex so I dint input any fee. It looks like the fees included for 1.075 btc is 0.006 btc
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:32:00
No. How do I find that ?
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:37:11
Fee is .006 for 1.075 btc. Miner preference is medium and confidence is 47% whatever that means!

A fiat cryptocurrency will never work because it defeats the purpose of a cryptocurrency! Taking a system that is controlled, centralised and closed and a system whose very purpose is to be open, borderless and decentralised and trying to mesh the two -- you get this weird hybrid that can’t do anything, The appeal of bitcoins lies in the fact that it is anonymous and decentralised and is not controlled by any single authority

The problem with fire.com and the likes is the fact that you need to be a U.K. Or EU resident to open such accounts. Any workaround for non eu/uk citizens ?

So I don't need to worry about this then ��
