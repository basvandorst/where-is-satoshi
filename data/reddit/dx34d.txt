If that's his best joke, he better not quit his day job. Oh wait, I don't think pumping schemes and scamming people, and being an all around smug clueless idiot can be considered a job... Proceed.

"Safecoin can be saved by sending BTC to their address, which will then guarantee you a certain amount of Maidsafecoin"    
The amount of stupidity in the crypto world is just astounding. Trading useless tokens for other useless tokens, wasting time, resources, all in the vain hope of scamming each other. You're all a bunch of idiots. Get a job.
