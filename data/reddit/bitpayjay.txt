You do not. We support merchants all over the world. Here's a bit more info to supplement what has said:

I'd encourage you to check out the documentation for our API- we've (well in this case, not me, but other people have) put a fair amount of time and energy into building one that's very simple to interact with, and it works much as you describe in parenthesis here.
If you have more questions, tagging a support ticket with the subject "Integration" will get it routed to me quickly.
Also- I'm working with a teammate on developing a wiki with much more content to replace this document.
(edit: noticed i missed an "n".)
@_date: 2013-10-08 06:05:26
Not a bad idea.

Thanks for doing this in support of Sean's Outpost. I bought in on the last t-shirt purchase deal, but that didn't happen- now we get to prove that Bitcoin is a better payment mechanism (and I actually get a t-shirt).
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:21:28
That was unexpected- thanks!
Feel free to PM if you're ever bored and want to talk cars.

I wish you'd been at the party at Bitpay HQ last Friday and had seen people tipping the servers with BTC.
There wasn't a POS at that table.
We don't need to integrate with something that we're working to make obsolete- our customer's buyer very likely already has a smartphone in their hand. That's all that's necessary to pay with Bitpay.
The double-spend attack argument is not relevant to our merchants- if you have enough money to own half of the Bitcoin network hash-rate, you aren't spending your time committing retail fraud.
Chargebacks, though? Yeah, our merchants worry about those. A lot.

Bitminter's a good noob option. Maybe try that?
@_date: 2013-10-08 05:18:12
We're currently discussing this- but my personal opinion (as in, this is not an official Bitpay statement, it is -my opinion-) is that having to vet every merchant that signs up may be a non-automatable process.
We have to manually check every vendor to maintain compliance with the laws that took down SR, as well as a variety of others. That means putting eyes on their stores and looking at what they are selling, to make sure that product does not involve drugs, guns, or anything else that might bring on legal action.
And yes, we get those applications.
Should we have a developer sandbox that uses testnet and allows instant access to build a customer integration? Absolutely.

How about "Digital Saint"?
Was nice to meet you in ATL. Please keep doin' what you do.

Great car; as a gearhead, I can't resist suggesting this:
@_date: 2013-10-11 16:03:50
You can buy from Amazon (and Ebay) with Bitcoin here:

Reducing customer integration costs is why (well, one reason) Bitpay recently hired me - I'm here to make that process as painless as possible for our merchants. Please let your friend know that any support tickets regarding this will come to an actual person who is responsible for this task.

Daily direct bank deposits will remain for all Bitpay merchants. That would be a lousy way to incentivize the new plan, and we're not doing it. As long as your balance exceeds the minimum threshold, you will continue to recieve deposits just as you always have.

He totally did.
And TIL: ...US Senators use Second Life?

If you choose not to opt-in to the monthly payment format, yes, everything remains the same for existing merchants.
@_date: 2013-10-08 03:17:26
That's correct.
Merchants have the option of accepting the Bitcoin sent, or translating to one of 30+ fiat currencies.
This is, I think, the crucial element of what we're doing- it still enables the important part of Bitcoin- making money transmission as easy as a text message- but it enables a merchant to never touch BTC if they don't want to.
@_date: 2013-10-12 00:35:10
Thanks for the plug.

I've been invested @ Havelock for a few months now- the outfit itself has been flawless operationally. Haven't done so well on stocks retaining their value, but them's the breaks.
@_date: 2013-10-08 05:08:40
I'd like to ask- on what kind of monthly revenue?
@_date: 2013-10-16 04:41:30
this: 
keep up the good work, Jason.
@_date: 2013-10-06 08:56:09
the wifi at the conference was crap. don't think the machine was root-cause.
@_date: 2013-10-07 19:01:46
We don't have full integration with Volusion yet, and you aren't the first to ask, but we can still get you operational as a merchant.
If you sign up for a merchant account and send a support request, it'll come to me and I can walk you through what needs to be done.
This will also help me build a case that we should develop a plugin- we haven't done it yet because not enough people have asked for it.
@_date: 2013-11-08 06:56:31
Purchased and upvoted.
@_date: 2013-10-16 05:10:33
apparently you have much more faith in the police's respect for property rights than i do.
that aside- if i were the homeless recipient, it'd be clear to me which option would improve my life more.
@_date: 2013-10-08 05:56:59
If you run into any issues with one of our solutions, contact support with the subject line "Plugin"- part of my job is to improve what we have on github, with the endgame being "it's so good you don't even need to talk to me".
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:26:15
As mentioned in the article- we are hiring. :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:56:41
Indeed:

All of what you've said here is what the wiki I mentioned is intended to do.
I absolutely recognize the need to address what you're pointing out here, but whether it's a "wiki" or a "blog" is kind of academic as long as it delivers the knowledge that the merchant needs to get operational, and there is someone interacting with merchants to continuously improve this content (that would be me).
If there's an argument to be made for one or the other, it's that allowing someone to publish content on your site is, by definition, an attack vector (see: bitcointalk), and I would rather spend my time working with customers- I actually like doing that- to build a content base that exposes our infrastructure to the least amount of risk possible.
I know this document is not enough. We're working on something better.

I can't wait to hear about how much he hates BitPay.
(ninja edit before yells at me about branding :)
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:08:01
I upvoted this so hard. Thanks for the laugh.
@_date: 2013-10-23 15:16:03
Missed this thread yesterday.
Just wanted to report we've reached out to Teespring.
Keep banging on their door about it, everyone!
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:43:52
shameless plug: BitPay has set up over 10,000 merchants to accept Bitcoin, and we add new merchants every day.
