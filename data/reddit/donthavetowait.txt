I live in CA so coinbase is psychologically appealing by being close...but am I going to drive up there with a baseball bat if my bank account get's drained?
 It seems like the great benefit of bitcoin is independence from standard financial institutions...but the first crucial step of moving from old way to new way worries me. localbitcoins.com looks interesting. Wtf is WebMoney? I guess I have some homework to do. 
And, um, yeah, this is one of my porn accounts, going for max paranoia level here. Ah man I already said I live in California

Thanks, and subscribed!

This is where I'm gravitating to...any suggestions? ING? HSBC? My concern is transaction costs.

This is definitely what I'm thinking of now. I wish I could get a one-off routing/account number like I could get a bitcoin address.

Thanks, I'm looking into local bitcoins and moneypak. I honestly just don't want to do something completely stupid, which I think is what scares some of us new-folk about Mt. Gox.

I guess the follow-up question is: why do I trust the transfer from savings account to sandboxed bitcoin checking account more than I trust the transfer straight to, e.g. coinbase?
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:18:09
How does 'bill payment' style work? If I understand correctly*, routing code + account number is enough to take funds from my account...like a blank check.
*- not likely

I guess in the end I'm trusting Ing over coinbase, with the same info, to not rip me off.

Forgive my noob-ness, but I read they were 70% of the exchange market...at least before this week.

Besides Cash by mail, Western Union, Paypal, and Cash Deposit, WebMoney shows up a lot on localbitcoins . Sounds both interesting and redundant. I guess what I mostly want to know is if other folks are ok with putting bank info on coinbase.

I life the definite one-way of this, but not so crazy about the cost. Washington Mutual used to give me free wire transfers, but, um, yeah, they're with Jesus now.

Well, off the top of my head: she's my wife, he's my brother, they're my friend, FDIC, NCUSIF, SIPC. Yeah, nothing's 100%, but I get more from trust than I lose.

I guess what was sobering for me was how many people were at Mt Gox. It sounds like most people who were paying attention were keeping well away, but in terms of raw numbers they were doing ok.
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:33:59
So *maybe* incompetent but not evil. I've dealt with worse.

I trust that it would typically cost banks more to them in reputation and actionable tort than my meager savings are worth. Of course there is also some aspect of 'everyone is doing it, it must be ok', but I like to know some of the reasons for others to do it.

I'm just concerned about giving crucial bank information to a pioneer in new currency, rather than a traditional bank/broker/govmt.  Possibly irrational I'll concede, but looking for feedback.
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:21:27
Well I'll have you know I've earned 0.00001796 BTC and I'm not about to let some financial fat cats take my ... no, but seriously though, that is a pretty strong indicator of legitimacy.  Not sure if I'll *invest* in coinbase yet, but they *definitely* qualify in the "not worth the time to steal my piddling crap" camp.
