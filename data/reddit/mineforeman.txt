That is the beauty of bitcoin, you can choose not to participate in a pool or choose a pool that fits your ideals.   
P2Pool is a popular option for those that choose to set their own values when mining and dont want to deal with the variance of solo mining.
Bitcoin is about choice.
@_date: 2016-04-08 01:31:44


Mostly because people are not that concerned about the politics of pool selection because they can always change if they feel like it (technical expertise as well plays a part).

Is that because when you are in a pool they can force you to not change your settings and mine elsewhere?

Raising the block size is an obvious and simple answer.  It is one that fairly much everyone agrees will be part of scaling.
If it is so obvious and simple why not just do it right?
As you probably have worked out, bitcoin is not all that cut a dried, there are interaction between the parameters set that are subtle and complex.  
As an example changing the block size (one little number) effects;-
* Node Count
* Transaction Fees
* Transactions Per second
* Spam
* Disk Space
* Network Bandwidth
* Network Latency
* Block Propagation
* Mining Profitability
* Mining Pool Count
* Security
* DOS vectors
The list literally goes on and on and on, some of those factors improve, others get worse and that is from one factor that seems obvious and simple (you also need to take into account those factors and what effect they have on the other factors on the list (and their own lists)).
Bitcoin development has long taken the belt and braces approach, small incremental improvements while at the same time counteracting the downsides to whatever we do.  It takes time, more time than some would like.

It makes it brilliantly efficient, I have one lightning connection and everything routes through that.


I am sure they will, but people wont connect to them directly, they will connect to a hub that connects to a hub etc...  
You are viewing lightning connections as a short hop network and there is absolutely no reason that it would work like that and plenty of reasons that it won't.  It is going to be a complex routing arrangement more akin to the internet than a single hub that everyone connects to.
People aren't going to open half a dozen lightning connectors to suppliers they commonly use, they will open a single connection to either their or someone elses hub and route through that for as many hops at it takes.
To address your points directly;-
1. He was using that in order to give network activity/size estimates, not to say that is how it will work.
2. That is actually a good reason as to why there will be many hubs.
3. He suggests that because it makes a simple demonstration of the concept, not because people will use it that way.
4. An intermediary hub only needs enough to close its transactions, my hub will only need enough to cover my expenditure until I receive income.  Someone with a net income to their hub does not even need that (Amazon for example will probably need no capitalisation at all).  Only a large hub that pays out only without any return will need full capitalisation (payroll companies perhaps).
You have a very simplistic view on how lightning network can work, I am beginning to understand why you see it as some big blob out there that everyone transacts with but in reality there will be THOUSANDS of moving parts.
@_date: 2016-04-07 01:47:11
So... if 50% of people decide to take your bitcoins away and share them amongst themselves you are happy with that?
@_date: 2016-04-13 23:04:18
You are clutching at straws, it is perfectly economical (and beneficial) for me to run a lightning him with 1 BTC in it.  With that 1 BTC I can easily cover thousands of bitcoin in and out.
It will be the same for hundreds of users and just about every bitcoin accepting business out there.
If that is your only honest objection I am rather disappointed.
@_date: 2016-04-13 20:50:55


I see this kind of statement all the time and I don't actually understand it.
When LN becomes a reality just about every company that transacts in bitcoin will have one along with a lot of people like me who will run one for my own convenience.  Together with all the people who will just run one for the community good means that there are going to be thousands of them at the least.
Where is the centralisation in that?

[By that I assume you mean mainstream bitcoin (not mainstream -the world-) and I will answer that way.]
Bitcoin is not rejecting what is mainstream, we call it consensus and a vast majority of the bitcoin community want what is going on right now with bitcoin.
However, there is a VERY loud minority that wants you to believe they are mainstream (they even may believe it themselves) despite the fact that none of the numbers we have (node count or mining) show true.

@_date: 2016-04-14 03:52:44


Strangely enough I am thinking the same thing about you.
Over the last few months I have put a lot of thought into LN, how I would use it, how others would use it, how corporates would use it and even how people will abuse it.
You on the other hand seem to have taken a presentation that was dumbed down to the lowest denominator for the widest audience and decided that it is all there is to LN.  So much so that you keep quoting the over simplified examples contained in it to me, it is as if you think that the entire intracises of LN network has somehow been compressed into it.
Can you imagine if all of bitcoin is just what is in the whitepaper?  Just 9 pages is no way near enough to explain the inner workings/interactions and all the cool stuff that has evolved out of it.
@_date: 2016-04-08 05:05:53
1. Transactions are verified by nodes, it is a picky difference but an important one.  Other than that, cool.
2. It is a special transaction called the coinbase transaction (nothing to do with the online exchange).  Probably the most accreate dictiption fo the transaction type is here  .
3. When a transaction is included in a block it has 1 confirmation.  When a block is built on top of that block it has 2 confirmations etc..  So you could also call confirmations "blocks built on top of the one that had the transaction in it plus one"... but that is a bit of a mouthful.
4. Banking, Internet, Military, Cellphones, TV, Nuclear Weapons, Space Probes, Cars....   If encryption goes away we may as well have a Zombie Apocalypse.
5. No idea sorry ;) .

You are just not reading what I am saying.
I have detailed to you how in my example (and a lot of others) I will be connecting to a single hub that will in turn rout through multiple hubs to get to the hub I want, I won't be connecting to Amazon or Walmart.

Mining is nothing like running a LN hub, there is next to no cost apart from initial funding and that is not actually a cost because you keep those funds.

It is fairly simple, a hardfork breaks everything that has gone before.  Full clients, wallets, payment api's everything has to be checked &amp; upgraded, there will always be stuff left behind in a on-functioning fork of bitcoin (**ALWAYS**).
In a soft fork those old clients etc continue working the way they have always worked no changes necessary and nothing left behind.
There are of course reasons to do hard forks but it is not without risk.

Basically yeah.  There have been a few people that have accepted 0-conf throughout history but they generally get burnt.  Shapeshift used to for example until someone demonstrated how easy it was to shift without paying the shape ;) .  Satoshidice still do it but since they pay you with your own inputs if your transaction does not confirm neither does your winnings.
People still double spend their satoshidice losses though but they just accept that as a risk.


BIP 65 (OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) went through just recently, everything seems to be shaping up for 0-conf transactions fairly soon actually.  People are actually developing/test ahead of time as well so it is looking good.
That said, it is always best to make sure things are ready before you enact them, the last thing you want it for it all to blow up in your face.  But yeah, instant transactions are going to be sooooo cool.
@_date: 2015-12-22 04:00:42


BIP101 does not actually compromise clients, it is a whole other kettle of fish but apart from that, yeah, running old client software is never a good thing and compromises your security (SegWit or not).
The attack vector on non-SegWit clients in a SegWit envirnment is actually very similar to an attack on bitcoin itself, i.e. sybil attacks and 51%.  The difference is you could actually force a particular client (not the entire network) to think that funds had been transferred when they actually have not been.


That is the real crux of the matter, in an ideal world everyone would update their clients as soon as a new version came out and then go through all of their other software and update that too.  Soft Forks give us the ability to move the network forward without blowing bits off it.
It is important to note before you get too agro towards me, I am just explaining the difference between the two because someone asked.

He said that after people started GPU mining and an arms race began.  At the time there were only a few people who had worked out how to do it and they had a vast majority of the hashpower.
He wanted everyone to step back and stop doing it and use the normal bitcoin client to do the mining (it did not work).

It really isn't, for example, it is still very hard for most of the world to participate in bitcoin (buy enough to use).

No it isn't, consensus is code.  It is the rules of the bitcoin network that all clients must obey way in order to be valid.
You are trying to turn it into something political to suit your agenda.  Code cannot go off and take a vote to see if something is valid or not, it can't get someone's opinion on something.  It is a set of rules to say if something is good or bad that all clients must obey.
You are so wrapped up in your politicking you feel like saying anything that doesn't align with your current agenda need to be dismissed an bulshitted about.

So, the people who are using them incorrectly (according to reddit) are distorting things.

Just for reference the equation is;-
priority = sum(input_value_in_base_units * input_age)/size_in_bytes
So in essence you are correct BUT it is like being chased by a tiger, you don't have to run faster than the tiger you just have to run faster than the other guy.
Spam transactions like the one that is happening today have a miniscule priority because they are the same coins being transferred over and over again.  That is why, even though this spam is going on, normal transactions are just popping through like normal.  The normal transactions are higher priority so they win.  The system works.
However, do we want these transactions at all, shouldn't it be more expensive for someone to use the blockchain against us like this?  Blockspace is a premium and sometime in the future it may be critical. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 00:31:10


No, the fault lies with bitcoin (how more clearly can I say this) it is not there yet, it needs more infrastructure for a start.  Things (as you point out) are getting better but we are not there yet.
There are other problems too, but this is the one you chose.

We cannot be expected to read the same horror stories but it sounds as if you have heard them as well.  The long and the sort of it though is that it is not as easy as just signing up to coinbase for most.
It is something that really needs to change, we are never going to hit that tipping point without it.

By default bitpay waits for 6 confirmations.
You can set your transactions to "High Risk" (it literally says that in the api) and accept 0-conf but you have to read a disclaimer and tell bitpay that you will accept the losses.

Nothing wrong with that (though I wish we could get rid of the tribal names), it may surprise you to learn that I also believe that we need larger blocks, I think just about everyone that has been called a "small blocker" (grrr) around here does.
I also believe that these large consensus changes to bitcoin need to be thought out, tested and re-tested (then some more thinking).  I think things are not going to explode over the next 6 months while we get this right and thing very well may explode if we don't get it right.
@_date: 2015-12-14 00:24:55


It may have looked like they were using 0-conf but they were not, bitpay would say 'paid' to the client but would still wait for confirmations to tell the vendor that it was paid.  If it never confirmed and error was sent to the vendor and they would have to sort it out.
Coinbase is indeed instant IF your funds are in your coinbase account, it was effectively an off-chain transaction.  If you were using the blockchain they did the same as bitpay.
Yeah, it is a great experience, but no confirmations no goods.
As I said though, things are in the works to give us real, safe 0-conf transactions though.

It is not your fault.  Consensus when talking about bitcoin is always 100%, they are just code rules and everyone follows the same rules.  Anything that does not follow consensus or uses different rules (namecoin, litecoin etc) is not actually bitcoin.
However, because of the semantics, you can say things like;-
"There is no consensus about consensus"
It is an oxymoron, either there is consensus or their isn't, you can't have both in the same sentence (at least not while making sense).  If they were called rules you could say;-
"There is no consensus about the rules"

That one is for certain, I remember him talking about it.  ASIC's did not occur to him either (or GPU mining).


Not so sure about this one, the block reward decreases were meant to be offset by the fee's so miners had a near constant level of income.  The theory was that even today you would get the original 50 BTC for a reward, half subsidy, half fees.
But hay, it is an experiment today and even more of an experiment on day 1 when that structure was put into place.  I am sure that if he was around today he would revise a lot of his 'Original Vision' to reflect what we have learned and the reality of what actually happened.

Huge opposition.
When I first got an 'internet account' ~1989 most people had not ever heard of the internet, most of those that had thought it was a complete waste of time.
You had to have a computer (most didn't) and you could only talk to other people who had the internet.  What a ridiculous waste of time!  If you wanted to download something you would use ftpmail and big stuff (50 MB was HUGE) would tie up your phone line for days!!!!  If someone mistakenly picked up the phone you would have to start again!!!!!!!!!  From the effing beginning!!!!!!!!!!
Also, you could not even find stuff, the closest you got to it was to use ftp to browse through directories looking for README.TXT file to download to see what the stuff in the directory was... and most of it you wouldn't want anyway.
When windows came along it did not even have the capabilities to connect without another program that was only available through the internet (chicken meet egg).
Seriously though, the amount of times I heard "No one wants it" is beyond counting and this attitude lasted well into the 90's.  If you want a good laugh read tis;-
It is about an old article on NewsWeek from 1995 (it contains the article) about how useless the internet is and how it won't catch on.  That was fairly much the 'common consensus' of people up to (and past) that date,

Remember, you can avoid fees altogether by aging your coins 1 day and using an address only once.  At the protocol level those kind of transactions are set to high priority. 
Wallets *should* by default be doing this for you (but there are quite a few shitty wallets out there).
@_date: 2015-12-31 01:02:51


That isn't actually what happens.  If you are using normal 'bitcoind' style mining you will be mining the previous block until bitcoind verify the transactions and says 'I have a valid block, we will start mining on it' (after is is verified).
If you are using "SPV Mining" or better called header mining you can start mining on the block immediately but you run the risk of the block being invalid (and that will orphan your block if you mine one).
The worst of all cases is when someone can make a block that takes over 10 minutes to verify, they can start mining as soon as they made their 10+ minute verify block is made and get a 10+ min headstart on everyone else.  I is just not a good situation.

Sorry, I am trying to be soft as possible but you should realise that theft is still theft even if you get away with it.


You cheated him though, you are a cheater.


No, absolutely not, the thing is you should have your own standards and live by them.  Even if noone else knows if you steal you are a thief.
At the moment your standard is that it is OK to steal if you can get away with it, is that who you really want to be?  Do you want your friends to think of you like that?
Do you think of yourself as a thief that cannot be trusted as your actions show?  Do you want to?  Wouldn't you much prefer to be someone who can be trusted and respected?  All you need to do is decide not to steal, lie or cheat (and mean it) and you are instantly someone who can be trusted who deserves people's respect (and your own).

Sufficient fee's to be included in the next block.  You can work it out statistically like Bitcoin-QT does or take a guess like many other wallets do.  In the end you could just blanket add 10 cents (USD) and it would work.


As I said earlier, there was no mediology to that test or any way to measure results.  The organiser was watching blockchain.info to see the results for god's sake.
It could have been a very useful test but as it stands it is just anecdotal evidence.  And the anecdotal evidence is that the bitcoin network performed exactly as we hoped it would, it let through transactions with sufficient fees while delaying spam transactions with no or extremely low fees until the network was less congested.

In order to 'make a block' you need data from the previous block.  So, to use your example, in order to work on block  you need to have  already.


No, they are trying to calculate a hash greater than the difficulty (using your words)


You can look at the hash of all previous blocks but until the blocks are made there is no way of knowing the hash in advance and when you know it, you just made a block.


No, transactions sit in memory of the nodes (called the mempool) until they are included in a block.

Mighty good question!
With SegWit as you know the actual signatures are offloaded into another block.  Left behind in the '1MB Block' is a script that validates as true in old clients when they check the validity of the transaction.
You need to upgrade to the newer version of whatever fully validating client you use to perform a full validation though but older clients still get the blocks as validated and agreed to by everyone else using the consensus code.  Idealy you should really upgrade of course but there are always people who lag behind.

One of the more controversial thing we have done of late is we ALWAYS take a user's posting history into account no matter if they post here or somewhere like .

You don't know what this term means and should stop using it,  cherrypicking in this instance would be picking only empty blocks or full blocks, that is not happening, he is taking the statistical norm dictated by the difficulty poisson process. 
You want statistics based on what is normal, not what is abnormal.  The only way to do that is select blocks that follow the norm, not short ones, not long ones, the normal ones.  I really dont know why you don't understand sorry.
If we used every block it will seem like that we need even smaller blockspace because, on average smaller blocks are quicker so we get more of them and larger blocks can only grow to a certain size (the block limit) no matter how long they take but there will be less of them.
I know the results you want, you want the data to show that the blocks are more full but you don't seem to realise that including every block will bias the statistics to show that the blocks are even less full.

Sorry, I am just a bit wary, I keep getting into technical discussions only to find out that someone has something else in mind :( .


Yeah, in the end they achieve the same purpose.  Idaly we should be able to hard fork every time, it is a clean solution because we know that everyone is running the same consensus code.  The problem is (as we have discovered in the past) people are lazy and don't keep up with versions :P .
The soft fork mechanism allows everyone else to move ahead and the lazy can catch up later.  It is not as clean because we have different consensus code running on different nodes but it is clean as in we don't break stuff.


Traditionally the ["Alert Keys"]( are used after and event not before.  You could send out a "Please Upgrade" message but as we have discovered, they are generally ignored by most for a variety of reasons.  Mostly because unless you are running Bitcoin-QT started it just appairs in your debug.log....  I dont know about you but I vary rarly check my debug.log.

Yeah, it is complicated, there are other factors that need to be considered but even if you cannot get into the 'free' category you can still have your transaction higher priority than spam ones.
.5 of a MB is still reserved for higher priority transactions so in order to have n kb of spam transactions you must have already n+1 kb of higher.  ( n being whatever)

The idea is that there are two mechanisms to get into a block, the first being the priority.
But there are still circumstances when you just have to spend outputs that have a low priority so adding a fee effectively pays a miner to miner it anyway.
It is important to note though, high priority transactions have reserved blockspace (fee paying ones don't) so there will always be room for 'free' transactions for us normal people and the spammers just have to suck it and pay.  I actually think they should be paying more.

This is just alarmist BS, this emotional take on blocksize really has to stop.

I mean it only in the sense that address you don't re-use tend to create smaller transactions because there are less inputs to output.
HOWEVER has pointed out to me that the 'priority space' in a block can be overwritten at the command line by the miner creating a block (I thought it was a constant, I was wrong).  It makes fees the only tool we have for regulating spam.  Priority still makes a slight difference but it is a wet bus ticket.

I fully agree, but we should not encourage people to adopt dangerous practices to get there.  0-conf has never been safe and implying that it is RBF's fault is deceptive.
Someone might think if they checked for the RBF flag and did not find it that meant the transaction was safe and that is just not true.  It is a limitation to the current bitcoin network and we should not be lieing about it.

Have you ever done any statistics?  It is very important to remove statistical anomalies from the data.
The way the poison process works in block difficulty makes it very easy to pick out those anomalies, the statistical norm is 10 minutes, anything to far deviated from the norm is an anomaly and will be either unusually large or unusually small.
We can actually use statistics to predict these anomalies but there is no point, we don't want anomalies we want the norm.

To be honest, I think consensus is not a great word for what we talk about when we are talking about bitcoin, it is too easily confused with other things.  (but that is what we have)
When we talk about consensus in bitcoin we are talking about the rules that govern how the code interacts with the blockchain (if I had my way we would rename libconsensus to librules to clear up misunderstandings like this).

The IP address is not stored in the transaction or anything, the best you could possibly say is that your client first heard it from a particular client at a particular IP but you have no idea where that client heard it from.  Hi-tech chinese whispers.

Just to be clear, 0-conf transactions have never been safe and this does not change that.  If anything the opt-in bit allows people to know for absolute sure that the transaction is not safe.

Only the launch bit would be expensive, once in space, pop out sails, get to a lagrange point and use the interplanetary travel network, snag an asteroid on the way through the belt and use the interplanetary travel network to get back.
A single 500m asteroid of the right type (you can be picky, there are lots out there) can contain close to 3 trillion USD ($3,000,000,000,000) of materials.

So your solution for email spam would be for everyone to get bigger hard drives?
Dont you think we should have a mechanism to prevent (or filter) out the spam?
@_date: 2015-06-09 23:29:46
No, increasing the blocksize won't help stop/slow spam (it may make it worse by providing more space).
The fee mechanism is designed to catch spam transactions and it is tuned to let 'normal' transactions through while making spam prohibitively expensive.  That is what I am saying might need tuning.
**Repeat:** This is not a blocksize issue, it is a spam one.

I fully agree, it is not the most perfect of attacks, I imagine the orphan rates would be high as well.  It does have the potential to be a bit of a hand grenade to throw at other miners.
It is probably not going to be an issue for much longer either (signature optimizations, IBLT's, week block etc..) but I always like to give some examples as to why things might be bad instead of just saying "it's probably bad" ;) .

The priority equation built into bitcoin makes them high priority, its bu8ilt into bitcoin, is that inherent enough?


Not at all true, the first .5 MB of transactions in a block are reserved for high priority transactions.  If you break that you are going to break consensus and your blocks are going to be orphaned.

I am not saying it was easy or even common, hell, most people had not even heard about the internet (like bitcoin).


I would agree with that, after http was rolled out everything on the internet became a lot easier.  It was still a pain in the ass to connect (windows did not even have its own tcp/ip over serial line implementation) but the tipping point had been well and truly passed.
Bitcoin is not at the at tipping point yet, I think we have a ways to go before we get there (if we ever do) but I am no sort of grand oricle like you make out to be, I can see the potential to get there but I don't have your crystal ball to see into the future.

Ummmm.... not much more to say :P .
@_date: 2015-06-09 22:01:43


No, while smaller amounts are treated with lower priority they are still high priority, the actual equation is;-
priority = sum(input_value_in_base_units * input_age)/size_in_bytes
'Whole Bitcoin' don't come into the equation (at the protocol level there is no concept).

I am actually looking at it now, it is enforced in the mempool, miner code transaction code..... yeah, it is a little complicated;-
It seems to be there, I need to do some tests to see how effective it is.


What is clear from what I am looking at is that n kb of low priority must be accompanied with n+1 kb of high priority.  You could probably game it but you would end up making smaller blocks not bigger ones.  It would not be in their interest when collecting fees from transactions.
@_date: 2015-12-18 09:04:58

Not absolutely but bitcoin-qt does do some statistical analysis that gets it spot on 99% of the time (unscientific statistic by me that 99%, it just seems to work).

No, fees are there to ratchet up the cost of spamming, lets leave the normal users out of it.  They may feel a miniscule change in the 10's of satoshis IF their transactions are not already high priority (and free).
Spam transactions are blatantly obvious on the blockchain, there is no problem identifying them have a look at an address that is being used in today's spam attack;-

That would be quite a large transaction in size.
Still, it may confirm as a lot of miners (or pools) dont mandate a fee yet.  It may take days though.
If you put a 0.001 fee in it though it would probably get picked up in the next few blocks.

I, like 95.57% of the world population do not live in your decaying country, and are quite glad about it.
Additionally, the "KYC Shit" you mention has always been there in coinbase, either you know that (and are lying) or you are new to bitcoin and did not realise it.

@_date: 2015-06-10 03:48:20
I did not even think that it was not a constant, I am now looking at the code enforcing it and thinking "WTF is the point of it?".  It is in the mempool code, the transaction code...  It is everywhere... all of it is nullified with a command line....
It makes fees the ONLY spam control somewhat backing up my original point but yeah... Why is this code even here?

This is "Working as intended".
Bitcoin is not the answer for every solution, however there are answers in bitcoin for most everything.
Back in 09 I remember a big thread on bitcointalk discussing two issues that bitcoin was not so good at addressing (I cannot find it now, but Satoshi was involved).  It covered two things that bitcoin struggeled with;-
1. 0 Confirmation Transactions
2. Micro-transactions
It was universally agreed that they were week points in the bitcoin protocol but quite easily solved by off-chain transactions so the need to address it within bitcoin was not a priority to address (if ever).

@_date: 2014-10-07 00:27:08
I feel for you, and yeah, you're screwed.
Looking at the transaction it seems to have been generated to take bitcoins from several addresses at once;-
This is quite common for this type of theft, they collect up private keys and grab it all in one go paying a large transaction fee to make sure it gets confirmed as soon as possible.
The cache thing is just a coincidence.
I the future, I would recommend that you don't use blockchain.info, not because it is inherently insecure but because there are much more secure options out there, I use electrum for my 'hot wallet' and I use paper wallets for storage of any larger amount.

I am not playing playing devil's advocate, I can see blockchain spam is already a problem, ever extending blocks to keep down fees will exacerbate the problem even further.

You are right of course, bitcoin (and crypto currencies in general) have perhaps a million users compared to billions of users of credit cards.
The point is, if credit cards were using a private/public key system as bitcoin does this could not have happened.  Credit Card companies could use private/public keys (it is all open source if they want to copy it out of the code base) but they don't.
As it is, to copy a credit card and get spending rights to the money contained in it it trivial.  That is the point I am trying to make.

@_date: 2014-06-11 03:48:02
OK... I will assume your not trolling and I will try explain it further.
With a credit card in order to make a payment you hand over those numbers on it.  Those can then be used to make that payment and if the people where dishonest they could write down those numbers and use them to buy something from Toys R US or somewhere.
They could even sell that information on the internet so that thousands of people could do the same.
With Bitcoin (or any other private/public key system) you don't hand over your numbers, the vendor gives you an amount to pay, and an address to pay it to.  Then you use your private key to sign it, the signature is what the vendor gets (as well as the bitcoins).
At no point does the vendor even get to see your private key.

I really am not trying to toll (even though I am on reddit I know) BUT
But I was not really talking about PF Chang's, I was talking about the credit card system.  It is old and archaic and can be "hacked" with a photocopier (or a pen and paper if you want to get old school).
The bitcoin public/private key system can be used to avoid that issue (providing you don't hand over your private key printed on a bit of plastic that is... but then.... yeah.... you cant be helped)

Just a small word of advice, blockchain.info is poorly maintained and quite buggy of late.
If your not planning to use your bitcoins right away look at creating a paper wallet, it you are, use something like Electrum on your PC or Breadwallet on you phone.
@_date: 2014-09-24 05:40:31
blockchain.info is just broken in general. 
It has problems, displaying blocks in the wrong order or with incorrect timestamps, some times it just stops for hours on end displaying no new blocks.
If they are not going to maintain and fix it they really should just take it down, it makes bitcoin look like it is falling to bits.

And yes, I realise that Europe is not a country (I live in New Zealand but spent my childhood in Europe &amp; the Middle East) but as you correctly point out, the article clearly states that the fraud is happening in Europe, don't you think if it was happening in her own country they would have pointed that out?

As far as what will work?  I am undecided.  I often think Athenian Democracy should be given another go.  A lot of the issues back then that stopped it have been solved now with technology.
I really don't know though and I think we should just go on trying while trying to avoid the mistakes of the past.  We need to also keep in mind our own frailty of thought.  Maybe one day we will get it right or something will happen to show us the way.

Importing private keys is considered dirty and it is discouraged in case people think a good way of giving/selling bitcoins is by giving out the private key.  It makes you actually do a transaction keeping the knowledge of the private key to one person only.

I disagree for two reasons though;-

Fair enough, I am familiar with the argument.  It could be going on I suppose but my opinion it is the free market in action that drives the price.
Regardless, my advice to anyone is just not to play their (the whales) game (if it is going in).  If you just buy or mine your coins and don't engage in the speculative trade you have won, there is no way for them to milk you for your assets.

Say I buy up a pile of tickets to an event and then wait in the parking lot of the event and wait for people who cannot buy tickets (because I bought them) and then sell them on for a big markup.
That is closer to what your doing, and guess what, it is illegal because it is scalping.
I only wish you scumbags would get thrown in jail too.
Just because you can do something it does not mean it is right.

As a miner I will take this one.
Just recently (Core 9.2) the transaction fee algorithm was changed so it does a "best guess" as to what is likely to get you included in the next few blocks.  You can adjust the fee according to how quickly you wish a confirmation.
However, the subject is moot at the moment.  Bitcoin fees at present are designed to prevent (or make expensive) blockchain spam, the miners are not relying on it (yet) for income.

Thats the ones, nothing is going to get your bitcoins back but you need to find out how they got them in order for it not to happen again.
We now have two possible attack vectors to look at;-
1. They "guessed" your password &amp; wallet identifier.
2. They got a hold of those files.
If you have 2factor authentication enabled on the site we can eliminate number 1, so do you?

I would also be interested to hear why you dislike bitcoin so passionately, I visit occasionally but I never get a good handle on what the issue is.
A lot of the posts are a bit rantish, others are just made up (like the OP).  I am sure they have valid points (at least to them) but it is hard to pick though the BS and find them.

I am very much looking forward for bitcoin to be tested in law, we need it and it will happen.
It will hopefully bring in a new age of financial responsibility because everything is right there out in the open and not subject to "creative accounting".  Another reason for it to be like it is I suppose.

No worries.
They may seem like random calculations but what they are actually doing is calculating the correct hash to sign a block and all of the transactions in that block.  It is an integral part of how the blockchain works.
Without that layer of security the hashing-signature provides it would be possible to do all sorts of "bad stuff" like double spending, counterfeiting etc..
Doing something else useful is totally possible and there are a few alt-coins that attempt to do just that (I am a bit dubious as to how well they succeed though) but you need to remember, doing more will cost more in terms of resources, it's not a saving, it is an additional cost.

It's just a best practices thing.  When making mobile applications (or desktop ones) it seems that bitcoin authors are attempting to give you as little rope as possible to hang yourself with.

Compared to that, bitcoin is one cheap ass system to run.  That's not including MasterCard, AmEx, paypal, ACH, banking etc.
While I am not as naive to think that all payment systems apart from bitcoin will disappear, you have to think that an "ideal world" with just bitcoin in it would be a much more resource friendly place.

That brings me back on topic, Apple obviously had a fair dose of bias that lead to the ban (drugs, ponzi's and crime).  It shows a lot of something (not sure what) that they looked past that bias and reversed their decision.  That is want we want everyone to do.

Disagreeing with me is something I can handle and respect ;) .  I just thought you were missing my point.
Bitcoins and credit cards aside, I believe a public/private key system is better than just a number used to access funds, it is something that I believe that we should be embracing and working towards.
You have your opinion too though, and I will defend your right to have it! ;)

Even Luke has not come out and said "we don't need bigger blocks".  (I just checked to make sure)
All of these recent threads about the need for bigger blocks seem to be strawman arguments with people that say the block size should stay the same.  As far as I know (and I follow it closely) no one takes that side of the argument.
Or I could just be getting old and grumpy.

I am not sure I understand you.
Being included in a block prevents double spending so I a little confused (I am probably not getting what you mean).

Yes it does.
@_date: 2014-06-11 04:55:13

You will if you use that card.  (simple as that)
Call your issuer and see if they have a card offering that does not charge for cash advances.
@_date: 2015-05-14 07:09:02


already answered the first bit so I will answer this bit.
You can use them like that, you could have one static key like you say and use a bip32 (HD in your words) key for the other part... or any combination you want actually (e.g. 3 static keys, 4 bip 32 requiring 5 keys to sign) .
As long as you dont use the same keys all the time to make the multisig address it will always be different.

I wont be able to run a node at home anymore so yes.
I live about 20km out of town so I am technically rural in New Zealand, there are also plenty of people in NZ and Australia that will be in the same boat.
Not to mention India, Africa, China.  Without doing any honest research it probably will prevent at least 2/3 of the world from running a node.
I will of course still be running a node on a server or two but not everyone has access to that kind of infrastructure.

I have made a few reddit bots in my time and the answer is;-
"Sometimes it just happens"
Reddit uses some sort of heuristic pattern matching to identify misbehaving users/bots and it is actually fairly good but it occasionally has unintended results.  
You can just PM the admins and they will un-shadow you as long as you have not actually been breaking the rules (as is the case here).

I would have to go with Satoshi on this one, a second (or third or fourth) implementation of bitcoin has the potential to cause serious issues even when they are all working towards the same goal.

@_date: 2015-01-09 22:06:25
Not at all, but let's keep that 3.5% number in mind to keep some perspective.
We are not talking about some "big overall picture" we are taling about a transaction.
If you really want to take it into account you would need to divide 25 by the total supply (nearly 14 million) to get the correct percentage.  And then you would need to divide that amongst the transactions in the block.  You could add that number to the transaction cost I suppose.
3.5% is still BS.

Someone was using transactions for reasons other than transacting (to make a political point, just as bad as the recent DDOS's) and the network up and defended itself.
While it was doing it, normal transactions went through fine.

There are 1,000,001 reasons that someone may not have heard in time, for a start the alert email arrived in my email box 12 hours after the closure.

Hot storage only, at least that is the intent.
Lots of people use it as cold storage by pulling off the wallet.dat but a paper wallet is probably better suited.

@_date: 2015-05-14 21:45:10
Sure, if you look at the bit that is decodeing the address you can modify it how you want, so for example if you wanted m/1/0/1 it could be represented as;-
    xpub_wallet.subkey_for_path('1/0/1').address()
Or the much more loop friendly;-
    xpub_wallet.subkey_for_path('1').subkey_for_path('0').subkey_for_path('1').address()
subkey_for_path requires a string so that is why I srt(x)'ed the loop variable.
You cannot of course get a hardened key out of a master public key but you can get around that by generating the MPK for the desired subpath and then looping through it as if it were a 0 path.

@_date: 2015-01-24 21:37:45
My goodness, why is everyone so sensitive?
I read the title and could not understand it until I had read the article, I am sure a lot of people thought that.  If he stuck with the original title of the article it would have made much more sense.
Do we need a group hug or something?

Went back and looked, you did not specifically say.
@_date: 2015-01-29 04:01:35


Today, yes, as I keep pointing out, this was quite some time ago when this reddit was a lot younger.  Different times.


Help kickstart, I did not do it alone and I never said I did.


Again, different times, back then there were so few places to go for information, everyone who wrote about bitcoin posted to reddit, it is just the way it was.  In  any given day you would be lucky if anyone wrote anything about bitcoin so we had to fill this community somehow. 
Sure, now it will get you banned, but remember we were bootstrapping a community.

True buttcoiner, everyone who thinks different is delusional.

Yeah, the problem is though you have said what you are doing here more than once, and they are different apparently!!
I will keep looking.

Meh, you're a pack of dudes that think they are smarter than everyone else and have no ambition to change the world.
The whole reddit is about taking down the rebels and keeping the same old system around because they have no hope of making things better.  (They are truly beaten by "the Man")

There was something almost schizophrenic about that post.

Upset?  Nothing, I am just like watching a troll squirm.  Make personal attacks, change your accounts, say you own bitcoin bla bla bla.
You come out do defend buttcoiners?  It is a sad community of snipes, like yourself.  How about instead of hiding you guys came out (as yourselves)?  To afraid to stand by your own words?
Of course you are.

You came defending buttcoin, a troll defending trolls.


You don't come up in my logs as you know?
But yeah, you seem to have a problem about me writing about butterfly labs, and once again I will ask you, what am I supposed to do, go back and revise history and alter my posts?  (Or perhaps I should delete them and pretend I did not say them as you do).


Yeah, and god forbid you actually are identified for being a troll, that would mean you don't have something to hide behind.

You mean the same lot that gave us quantitative easing, subprime loans, recessions and stock market crashes?
**NO**, I am not bending bitcoin to their desires and you shouldn't be either.
Face it, they have a LOT more money than we do, they also have a lot more people to 'vote' the way they want.  If there is ever a decision between what is best for bitcoin and what is best for those guys I honestly don't care how overwhelming their support is or how many votes they can muster or money they can raise. 
I am going to go with what is best for bitcoin every time.
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:59:09

But you still get your news here?  That is a bit hypocritical of you don't you think?
@_date: 2015-01-21 03:14:34
He is not just posting "I hate bitcoin".  What he posts is in context and has sources.
It implies that he is researching bitcoin constantly (a lot more than I do) and tweeting things that he finds relevant.  I don't know how much time that would take but it is not 5 minutes.
@_date: 2015-01-30 07:09:37


To be fair, it is human behaviour in general, but yeah I do get where you are coming from.
I would say more but I am too scared of this "redandwhite" guy.

No, not writing did it.  People loved my articles, thousands of hits a day (back then that is saying something) I wrote for the bitcoin magazine and they syndicated my articles.
When I was actively writing I was one of the most read bitcoin places on the internet, where were you?  How did you help kickstart bitcoin?

Remember, back then there were literally a handful of places talking about bitcoin and the rules were laxer back then.  Good or bad, that is just the way it was, no CoinFire, no CCN, no CoinDesk.  The entire community was less than 100,000.
Nowadays even this reddit has over 150,000 subscribers and yeah, things are different but back then, if we did not write the news it would not have happened.


It got left behind because others had taken up writing about bitcoin, it seemed that every time I was about to write something someone else already had.  My job was mostly done, real journalists had taken over.
I may get back to it one day, I do kinda miss it.

Butterfly Labs built bitcoin miners that I talked about, so?  Do you expect me to go back and revise thinks I have said?
You bitcoins are just a negative, that is it, just negative bitcoin.  You recycle bitcoin new and make snide comments about how stupid everyone else is.  You seem to think that just because this is the way the world is nothing is ever going to change.

Aren't we just becoming regulators?

Yeah, I know... I suppose I am just a bit nostalgic for the days when bitcoin was worth nothing so no one was scamming ;) .  Along with bitcoins growth and new people we get bad apples, and it is just going to be like that.


yeah, he lost me there too, I was just looking back to the greener pastures that only exist in my head.


And that is why I never lost faith in it.
@_date: 2016-03-03 23:04:07
This is very meta, but I will answer as myself.


Blockstream employ a few of the 90 or so bitcoin core developers and blocksteam developers as well as core developers by in large have come out and endorsed scaling, capacity and block size increases in bitcoin.  I can't of course talk for any of them and some have not said anything at all but the 'core is against block size increases' argument, apart from being straw-man because they are actually a diverse group of individuals, doesn't actual line up with reality.
It is unfortunate that so many people believe that core is against scaling but there you have it.  I cant say there is some sort of organised FUD campaign going on but sometimes it does feel like it.  We do know that there is a lot of sock puppets, vote abuse, brigading and other shenanigans going on that has distorted what should be a civil productive debate into some weird internet phenomenon mostly centered around reddit.


The moderation policy we employ is no secret and is fairly simple and been around for just about as long as has been around, we follow bitcoin consensus (the protocol rule, not social media votes).  Everything flows from that, either something complies with bitcoin consensus (the protocol rule) or doesn't, one is on topic, one isn't.
It is fairly important to note though, we don't set bitcoin consensus as moderators, bitcoin developers do.  If you want to change consensus it is fairly useless to yell at us (and other redditors) because we don't set it.  You need to be making your arguments on the bitcoin mailing lists, IRC etc because that is where the polices are agreed to.
@_date: 2016-03-01 08:09:56


No, you just need to pay more than anyone else and fees scale inversely with block space.  That is the whole point of the fee argument, if blocks are full fees go up, if blocks are empty fees go down.
@_date: 2015-01-30 04:39:52

Bitcoin should never do what is popular, it should only do what is right.
Public pressure groups and 'democracy in action' is what gave us our current (awful) monetary system, bitcoin was invented to get around that.  If we start falling into the same ol same ol of the mistakes in the past we may as well not bother.

@_date: 2016-01-17 06:42:45
You have the basics of it.
There is a bit at the end though that (mostly) prevents people mining non SegWit blocks though.  
The blocks are versioned and the network monitors newly created blocks for those version bits and when last 95% or so blocks mined are with the correct version the soft fork locks in, waits a few weeks for the last 5% to catch up and then does the soft fork.
You can still lose that 5% of course but it is unlikely, after all, who wants to mine an invalid block?
@_date: 2016-01-10 21:54:39
Heh, very interesting!  A new type of fork.
I think the name is misleading though, should be something like generalised fork and not a soft fork.
The entire point of a soft for is that old clients will not reject the new chain (as they would in this case).  Nice find though, interesting stuff.

Back to my site, goodie!
Yes, back when I was actively posting a lot of traffic came from reddit.  It is an odd thing, bitcoin has found itself quite a home here and most pro bitcoin sites get most of their traffic here, that is just the way it is.
I was by no means spamming though, I also post other sites, other people also posted my site.  It is just traffic.
Is this all you find offencive about my site?  If so I am quite happy about that.
@_date: 2015-01-21 04:32:32
Yeah basically.
It is a form of "Researcher Bias", if you have already made your mind up about something it is amazing how you can find a ton of information that apparently agrees with you.
Works both ways of course :P .
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:56:46
Not sure about you jurisdiction but I think it is close to mine (New Zealand, we both come under Commonwealth Law).
The way it would have to go is they would set up an account under their name and use their bank account.  You would have to buy bitcoins off them and not the exchange, not ideal I know.
But hey, ask the olds anyway.  Like I said, they may be understanding, they may even learn something from their offspring, they like crap like that.

The fact of it is without going to hundreds of gigabyte blocks there is no way bitcoin can scale to VISA levels without something like the lightning network.
So, if bitcoin wants to be a viable global network, yeah lightning network is going to be part of it.

He equates the block reward with fee's.  People making transactions do not pay the block reward so his 3.5% fee number is BS.

Improvement?  Honestly I wouldn't.
Having worked with single board computers a lot I have a fairly good handle on what they are good for (lots of things) and what they are no so good at (things like this).
Especially as you point out, a Trezor is actually cheaper, more reliable, more secure and comes from a far more trusted source.

Just the one hoop, over and over again, you don't want to accept it though even though there is evidence.  You don't seem to be able to accept that things change, that is your problem I had nothing to do with it.

@_date: 2016-03-10 01:26:50
Not particularly.
The problem is that it pays for your winnings (or losses) with the outputs for your inputs.  
So, from a blockchain perspective they can just follow your original bitcoins from you, to Satoshidice and then back to you.

@_date: 2016-03-08 21:01:41
The last conference ended up with a miners agreeing and yeah, it is going to be a while for 2 MB blocks.
However, this SegWit thing is a block size multiplier and it is going to be here in a few months.  It IS an effective block size increase as well as a lot of other things needed before blocks get into the 3+ MB range.
Even by itself, transaction data will be able to be anywhere between 1 MB and 4 MB on top of all of the other cool stuff it can do (tests show they will probably be around 1.7 MB).  Yet, there is a set of the community that refuses to listen, they are focused on one number and that is it.
@_date: 2016-03-25 03:14:59
Of late I have become more and more aware of the shortcomings of the voting system.  Not only is it so easy to game the administrators of reddit themselves don't seem to be able to do anything about it.

@_date: 2015-05-07 23:52:03


Basically yes.


No.  Putting blind trust into someone that is no longer around is foolish.  Did you know that Satoshi's initial vision of bitcoin transactions was that everyone would run the daemon and transfers would be done via IP addresses?  He also did not envision multi-sig, should we take them back out again?
Things change and lessons are learned and we *need* to adapt to them.  A powerful thing about bitcoin is we are only just starting to learn what we can do with it, if we limited ourselves to "just what Satochi said" bitcoin will be a fraction of what it could be.

It also happens to be true, during the initial block sync you need to verify every bitcoin transaction &amp; block that ever happened.   It takes some time.

Absolutely not.
Bitcoin is growing at an amazing rate, nearly 100% in the last year alone.
When there is a 50% increase in transactions in a single day is when I call bullshit.

I think it is a limitation in the reddit api, you can only query a limited amount of time in 2 seconds so there is some variance in it.  In some cases it can take up to 90 seconds but most often it is far less than that.
But yeah... underhanded stuff.

I mean those responsible for the current system (yes, that includes you and I).  The democratically driven, special interest co-opted mess of a system we have now.

@_date: 2016-03-30 06:19:47
You need the block headers of all previous blocks to ensure that the block with the signed UTXO set validates all the way back to block 0.
So, 80 ish bytes per block + however they are planning on storing the UTXO signature.  As I said though, nothing is finalised but that is the idea.  Sorry I am a bit vague on technicalities but they haven't really been worked out yet.
@_date: 2016-03-08 22:24:54
I imagine all wallets are working on displaying RBF transactions, it is not a hard thing to do and is valuable for the user.
It is important to note though, 0-conf transactions are not safe even without the RBF flag so if you are going to accept 0-conf you need to factor in fraud to your margins.
Lightning Network will change that... but not yet.
@_date: 2016-01-06 03:30:30


Nope, totally agreed.


Not really, it gives the vendor a big red flag to watch out.  If anything, it makes double spends more obvious and avoidable. 


Yep, that is the use case for RBF.  I am sort of 'meh' on it to tell the truth.
@_date: 2016-01-06 06:43:50


I am envious.  Where I live there isn't a bitcoin accepting business with 200k :( .


Not if you are using Bitpay or Coinbase, they make the merchant carry the risk (unless it is off chain).


I said it was not safe and OptIn-RBF does not change that.  It works perfectly fine if the vendor accepts the risk.

That has been suggested before.
The problem is that miners can just make up as many transactions as they need at whatever fee they want to pay to hit the target at no cost to themselves.
@_date: 2015-05-31 00:26:38


No it's not, don't be so silly.
It is a technical and economic thing, there are many reasons for and against how big blocks are.  If you cannot think of them it is you that have the 'psychological thing'.

Ahh, sorry.
I do apologize, i was swayed by the title of the thread.
@_date: 2016-03-14 05:49:30
I am sure bigger blocks will have something to do with scaling, just not everything.
It is a shame about him not wanting to continue though, he had a valid point that I often think about (my words and extensions of the idea);-
KYC are going to make it just about impossible for large organisations like exchanges (in the jurisdictions that has the requirement) to run effective lightning network nodes.  For some time I thought that places like Coinbase &amp; Bitstamp might run big LN nodes but, unless they do some KYC on every external channel opening (not really all that possible), it is probably going to be impossible for them.
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:49:48
If the amount of transactions showed an normal increase over time I would tend to agree with you.
We are not seeing that though, all of a sudden for the past day we have had an extra 40-50 MB of transaction in a day.  No ramp up, no variance (the real give away) just bam, more transactions.
@_date: 2016-01-01 06:40:28


Positive, a single miner can play as many 'transaction games' he wants but unless he controls the majority of the hashpower he can't stop you transacting.... this is sort of bitcoin 101.

There is nothing legitimate about this attack, the mempool of most nodes has gone from somewhere under 10 MB to now peeking at 48 MB in a single day.
It is an attack, someone DDOSed Classic nodes so someone else is DDOSing the entire network as 'revenge'. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 06:16:26
That is what mining is yeah, but no single miner can decide he doesn't like your face and exclude your transactions from blocks (at least not without 51% of the hashpower).
It is kind of the point :/ .

@_date: 2016-01-06 03:59:43


I totally agree, they would just use the normal weaknesses in 0-conf.
I am not actually arguing for optin-RBF, I am saying that 0-conf is not safe and should not be promoted as such.  People have already lost money using 0-conf and optin-RBF is not going to fix or hurt 0-conf because it is already broken.
@_date: 2016-03-16 01:00:41
Not enough unfortunately, if you budget for about 0.022 BTC per block you can effectively match the fees spent on every other transaction.

It is not closed source.
What they have done is switch from a license that allows anyone to download and use their code to a license that allows you to download and look at their code.
It is in response to chinese knock off's hitting the market already and they have not yet made back their development cost.
There is a bit of controversy because it looks like the retroactively change the license on a few months of code.

Peasko isn't banned.  No setup there.


Not soft-forked, "generalized" soft forked.  Even then I think it a bad name, firm fork is much better IMO.  Soft fork usually means that older clients can still follow the longest chain and that is not the case here.
@_date: 2016-01-05 02:48:50


I am not too keen about them either but this outcry that it breaks 0-conf is just a bit over the top, it was always broken and OptIn-RBF does not change it.  If anything, it makes it easier to avoid getting ripped off.


Neither of those are going to secure 0-conf, there are things in the works that will allow instantaneous, secure transactions but we are not there yet.

Well, I can confirm that a lot of prominent bitcoiners get them, I come across them as part of my mod duties and refer them onto the admins.  I hear in general talk that they get them as well through other channels but I cannot confirm that.
Hopefully they do the right thing and send around a police car whenever they are able.
I have to say it is quite damaging.

Checkpoints are generally frowned upon, it implies trust in an untrusted envirnment.
It is something that developers actively avoid and want to remove from the code.
@_date: 2016-01-06 02:48:43
It was already dead, 0-conf has never been safe to use.
There have always been substantial risks to 0-conf, it is too easy to make a transaction that will never confirm or to double spend them (or spend something that you have already double spent).
People are only on this bandwagon because they want to rage at core devs some more.

It is nevertheless true that a miner can digard transactions (or all transactions) but as long as there is still a network they will still get mined despite his wishes.

When you do a RBF transaction you need to set a flag in it, there is no way to hide the flag and anyone can see it.
If shapeshift see an incoming transaction with that flag.... yeah they know something is up, no additional checks needed.

Because you got agreement from the involved parties.
As I said though, it is unlikely that you will get agreement from anyone that blocks should be 2kb but if you can make the case, get people to agree why wouldn't you do it?  Obviously to get agreement you would have sorted out all of the issues with it.

We cant be looking at the same graph, this is the one I mean;-
@_date: 2016-03-01 04:49:06


It is actual anywhere from 1 MB up to ~4 MB depending on transaction type and how efficient we can make our transactions.
@_date: 2016-03-16 00:56:16
If you count the value of transactions (in bitcoins) in the mempool it has jumped from ~ 10k to about 3 million.  That is very unusual.
The average fee per transaction per kb has also quadrupled.  The transactions in mempool count is also up marginally.
It could just be some very rich people all deciding to move their bitcoins around at once in smallish transactions but that seems unlikely.
@_date: 2016-03-15 19:53:34

@_date: 2016-03-15 22:32:26


I never said the two things don't collide.


If the technical argument had been made and accepted to do it last month it would have been (20GB blocks at that) but it wasn't.  Since then we have had a series of attempts to circumvent the process by popular vote with no technical agreement.
It is not a 'what come first, the chicken or the egg?' problem.  You need to agree to change and then implement it, you don't unilaterally decide that everyone must change and then go to social networks and get support for it.
@_date: 2016-01-11 01:25:36
It is an interesting idea.  It is important to note though, this is not like a soft fork that you are used to, old clients will outright reject the new chain with the larger blocks.
That is why they put the "generalized" bit on.  Firm Fork would be my choice of name ;) .
@_date: 2016-01-06 03:24:02


Shapeshift do a pile of analysis to decide if they are going to do it (because they go so ripped of by 0-conf previously), even then, I am told it is very unlikely that they will do 0-conf.  Interesting to note, RBF would make it easier for them not harder.
Bitpay &amp; Coinbase don't do 0-conf, it looks like it but the merchant does not get a 'paid' signal until there has been some confirmations (cannot comment on Others though :P ).


I am not a RBF proponent, I am decidedly meh about the idea to be honest.  I just wish people would stop saying that 0-conf is even remotely safe, there are too many ways to game it.  
Sooner or later someone is going to believe them and lose the farm, it is irresponsible to promote it as a payment option.

More improvements are coming to (just delayed while they work on other stuff).

I think the core devs are well sick of those sorts of tactics, they are getting in the way of proper discussion now because they don't want to speak out because of such 'traps'.
You will note that everyone has just rolled their eyes up and left the thread instead of continuing the conversation.

Nothing has been removed, it is optin.


What I find disappointing is that people are misrepresenting 0-conf as something that was safe and optin-RBF somehow changed that.


I am not saying that, businesses can take whatever risks they want, but stop saying that 0-conf was somehow safe before optin-RBF.

What makes you say that?  
Shapeshift lost a bucket load a while back to double spends, satoshidice has a plague of people double spending their losses.
It is not as if it is hard to do, I can do it and I am far from unique.  If a major digital sales outfit started doing 0-conf transactions they would be plagued instantly with double spends just as the people are who try to do it today are.

* We have default behaviour with the mod stickies.  They are very new and we have not actually used them alot so we have not even considered doing anything too them.
* We disabled low score collapsing on normal posts because people were being buried and not heard.  ("I disagree", "I don't like you" votes etc.)

I keep saying, it was a new community with different rules..  How is that avoiding it&gt;


What gain?  Hits and a few cents from google ads?  The gain I fell most happy about is the gain in visibility that bitcoin got by having people talk about it.


Again, I have never denied posting, again I ask you to remember, they were different times, we were building something it is BLATANTLY CLEAR that the rules were different back then because I was not shadow banned.

I soooo agree with this, consensus in bitcoin is a set of software rules but I often see it being referred to as something someone agrees with or not....
You get weird semantics with it called consensus like the one you have, my favorite is;-
"There is no consensus about consensus"
It is an oxymoron and it is painful to read but it is actually correct....
IMO we should put a patch together renaming it to protocol rules or something just to avoid confusion.

No, you have to look at statistical anomalies and there sure as hell is one here, even with your own numbers.  Environmental factors are also a good thing to take into consideration.
So, Lets list them;-
* Statistical anomalies in transaction count, fees and size
* Some ass hat has been ddos'ing nodes that they don't like
* No large new services recently 
* Spam attacks are common
* No large price swing (for bitcoin, it is still well withing its normal volatility)
To me it seems fairly conclusive, some other ass hat is retaliating against some other ass hat.

As for the other changes made to the CSS you are probably talking about the 'low score' thread collapsing.  We were finding that users were getting downvoted into oblivion and collapsed for "I disagree" and "I don't like you" reasons so we stopped low score post thread collapsing.

It was a subtle dig (perhaps to subtle) at the poster saying;-

I would guess that it will eventually drop off the network sometime soon.  I am surprised that bread wallet let you make a transaction like that, did it come up with any warnings?

Nothing new in the past few months unfortunately.  Other stuff taking priority and all the IBD (Initial Block Download) is getting very little love at the moment.
I am hoping that sometime between SegWit launch and the 2MB hardfork the developers are going to get back and do some of the stuff they like doing for a while.  It would be really nice to have before the blockchain gets too much bigger.
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:20:40
Hmm... you could just import random ans shuffle them like this;-
    from pycoin.key.BIP32Node import BIP32Node
    import random
    xpub = 'xpub661MyMwAqRbcG7Pmb3ptpvdPDePwP6edjxjuFdxg7AWozgpvTkqrb1Pm86poiZyQ6p8fFpJ1WLrqUPGHsW2iTxgTLBuDw2Dmdo2guSe7zwC'
    xpub_key = BIP32Node.from_text(xpub)
    addresses = []
    for x in range(0, 3000):
        addresses.append(xpub_key.subkey_for_path('0').subkey_for_path(str(x)).address())
    random.shuffle(addresses)
    for address in addresses:
        print address
I have no idea why you would want to though, without access to the keys there is no way someone with the address could ever determine what order they were in to start with so a random list will look just like an ordered list.  You know what your requirements are better than I do though ;) .

Not at all, if the vendor is willing to take the risk that is upto them.
However, the risk is substantial, certainly not "less than 0.00001% of the time" as is mentioned in the article.  I can create transactions that will never confirm 100% of the time and double spends that work ~10% of the time without difficulty and I am not unique, lots of people can do it.
Understating the dangers of 0-conf transactions is outright dishonest.

Yeah, if I had the choices between breeds of RBF I would have gone with FSS as well.  In reality though, fairly soon this 0-conf problem is going to be eaten by something else and won't be an issue anymore (LN).


I think the main use case was to 'bump up' the fees on a transaction until in confirms.  I suppose it is useful for that, but yeah, meh.


Checking for the RBF flag is trivial compared to the mathematical/network gymnastics have to do to be 'sort of sure' that a 0-conf transaction is OK (and even they you may be wrong).

@_date: 2016-06-25 07:17:34


Not in bitcoin no.  It is a byproduct of the decentralisation that there is no entity out there to set a 'guaranteed' level.
Even if you pay huge fees (100,000 sat per byte or something silly) while it is most likely to work there is always the chance that everyone else could do it at exactly the same time &gt;&lt; .
So yeah, no guarantees but paying a higher fee always helps.

True, it still pisses me of though.  We want to have conversions like this in but we should be able to do it without the organised goon squad descending on us.
@_date: 2016-06-05 05:03:53
It sounds good doesn't it?  Just increase the block size and bang, we can have 1,000,000 (or whatever) transactions.
Unfortunately it is not as simple as that (certainly not as simple as changing one line of code as some say).  Bitcoin under the hood while being simple to get your head around has all sorts of parameters and interactions that even a simple small change like 1 MB to 2 MB has a lot of kick down effects to other things (and then to other things).
Some of those interactions we know and can compensate for (DDOS via excessive SIG_OP's etc..), some of them we don't know about, some of them are desirable, some aren't.
Having said that, there are block size increases on the way but most developers want to take a cautious approach whereby we try to anticipate the problems before they happen.  Others favor a more aggressive approach where you make changes and then deal with the consequences.
The approach you like is entirely up to you but have a good read about what both camps say, there are some smart people and if you dicount anyone you are probably missing out on at least part of the picture.

@_date: 2016-06-09 07:02:37
Yeah, its a shit word for what want to use if for.
Here is an example, lets say everyone agrees to make blocks 1 minute apart.  That means we have consensus (agreement) for 1 minute blocks.
However, if no one changes the bitcoin consensus (code rules) it doesn't matter how much we agree, consensus (code rules) say that blocks take 10 minutes.
So, consensus does not match consensus (oxymoron).  When you are talking about an authorization from 95% of the network you are talking about what people think and bitcoin doesn't actually care what people think, it cares about the rules (grrr consensus).
So, yeah, change the rules (consensus) and that is bitcoin.  However, just changing what people think through social media campaign doesn't change the rules (consensus) you need to convice developers to do that not scream at each other on reddit.  We as mods have no control over them but they are the people that you need to convice (not us).
[I effing hate we call it consensus]
@_date: 2016-06-16 22:00:54
Lets say it took you 15 minutes to find the block was invalid.
That means that the miner that made the invalid block has a 15 minute head start on you to find the next block.
In reality what he would be doing is only making some small percentage of blocks invalid (say 10%) but making all of his blocks long verify.  Anyone competing with him will have a 1 in 10 chance of having their blocks invalidated if they use head only or, if they are doing full validation the malicious miner will have a 10+ minute had start on them.
Now, imagine that not just one miner is acting like this.

Crap, how are you meant to make sense of that?  I suppose the developers think they are being funny but it is your money that we are dealing with so perhaps it is not the place for joking.
I will have to look at Mycelium coin selection and fee algorithm, a lot of people have been saying that they are having problems with it.  I have not used it before (I don't have an android) but in the 'ideal world' your wallet should be taking care of the 'under the hood' crap for you (at lest better than it did for those two transactions).
Having said that, there are funky things going on with transactions at the moment (as evidenced by this thread).  It certainly seems like someone/some people are trying to make life uncomfortable for its users.

I can see I am getting nowhere, not your fault, I am just explaining it badly I suppose.
I will try one more time using your 'censoring discussions' as an input, so, two points of view;-
1.  Discuss changing the rules = Discussing changing consensus = Perfectly fine: we try not to touch it (things got very abusive very quickly so we had to put the brakes on that).
2. Release software with different rules (consensus) and try to get people to use it = Changing consensus (rules) without consensus (agreement) = We have a problem:  Anything that does not follow consensus (the bitcoin rules) is not bitcoin and does not belong in .
@_date: 2016-06-25 07:05:52
My guess would be somewhere towards the end of the 80's .
I got my first internet access about then, it was a pain in the ass to use and there was few services available (email, ftp &amp; news mainly).
By the time you are getting into the 90's you have things like gopher and http hitting (the killer app) and I personally don't think we are really there yet with bitcoin (getting there, but not there yet)
@_date: 2016-01-02 04:19:43
Please, he asked if the coin supply could be soft forked and you said yes.
It is that simple.
@_date: 2016-06-09 06:50:49
OK, I will explain it in more detail for you.
The filter lists in auto mod are not rules, they pick out words like "MySuperSpecialAltCoin" (Not actually there) and bring them to the mods attention.  The theory is that if someone is talking about "MySuperSpecialAltCoin" chances are they are talking about an altcoin (MySuperSpecialAltCoin in this case).
Now, just because they mention MySuperSpecialAltCoin it does not mean they have broken a rule, that is why a moderator would look at it and take the appropriate action.  
So, if the post was "MySuperSpecialAltCoin is GREAT!!!1!!!" it would probably be flagged as off topic.  
Additionally, trolls often use common phrases "I have a lovely bunch of coconuts" as an example (fairly sure that is not in there) so automod will flag posts with "I have a lovely bunch of coconuts" in it for mod review.
So, in this example someone could be posting "I want to buy coconuts with bitcoin" and someone replies "I have a lovely bunch of coconuts" and the mod will probably approve that.
Now do you see?  While the words in automod are not rules they are very useful tools for us mods to put a cap on those darn coconut spammers.  If we put out the lists of words those smart coconut guys would just start using c0c0nuts instead because they would see coconuts in the list.
Fairly simple really.

Your talking about consensus as something people agree with.
I am talking about consensus as the rules of bitcoin.  I have never liked it as a label but who am I to argue, if I were Satoshi I would have called them protocol rules or something.
We end up with situations like this where we can pump out oxymoron's like "There is no consensus about consensus" and be correct in the actual statment (with two meanings to consensus)
@_date: 2016-06-10 07:03:39


I would agree with that but what can you do?  With bitcoin you cannot know in advance what everyone else will be doing but that is just a byproduct of a decentralized system.  Without taking the decentralized bit out (please don't) future states cannot be predicted 100% of the time and no matter what you change (except authority) you are never going to fix that.
Saying you can tinker things in order to get accreate prediction is overstating your case so please don't go there.

I think back to another example of an exchange that had overwhelming support from the community, long before it went belly up the word around here started to get more and more suspicious.
It probably saved thousands of people getting got by MtGOX.  So yeah, while I am not saying Coinbase is in the same category or has the cance to go the same way I am absolutely saying we need to be able to complain about bitcoin companies and you saying it is FUD is, not only untrue, it removes one of the safety features of Bitcoin (we talk about this shit).

I suppose you could argue that.
At the time it was in response to the shear amount of new threads being posted, even the ones that were perfectly OK in our opinions were getting multiple reports from your ever day average redditor because it was getting repetitive.
Repetitive we do actually have a rule about so it was either a meggatread or we would have to pick and choose 2-3 threads a day and that was kind of unfair.

@_date: 2016-06-16 20:56:33


There are a few but I will give you one as an example.
It is quite possible given unlimited block space (or just a limit that is too high) to make blocks that take more than 10 minutes to verify by nodes.
So, miners could use these 'long verify' blocks to knock other miners off the network (as well as a host of other things).  As you know, the less people that can actively mine the less security bitcoin has.
@_date: 2016-06-09 01:19:04


Not actually true, you have always been able to discuss block-sizes, different proposals and your opinions of what they should/shouldn't be and how the code would work.

However, people took that as license to be able to abuse others who did not agree with their point of view or even taking it a step further tried to get people to run non consensus code.  Bitcoin is all about the consensus, change that and you change bitcoin.
Not the other way around.

Lots of people have been working on it for quite some time now but I know what you mean, sometimes it feels like nothing is happening.  I suggest you sign up to the bitcoin mailing list if you want to get a feeling for the amount of work going on.
The 'everything is going to blowup' aspect has been overplayed by some.  According to the predictions it should have happened months ago but instead, as was designed, the systems cost/reward system has kicked in.


It is and what is more, people have done it.  It generally increases fees and confirmation time and is a pain in the ass.  You would have to spend a lot of money (at least lost more than they did) to actually kill bitcoin but it is defiantly an attack vector to be wary of.
However, just increasing block size actually increases the ways you can DDOS bitcoin not decreases it.  Someone with enough money can still full blocks at 2 MB, 5 MB or even 50 MB.  On top of that though they can get even more creative and do some really nasty things to the network (SIG_OP attacks, network fragmentation etc...)
But yeah, as I say, the problem is being worked on.  Have a good read about SegWit for example, it is a capacity increase like a size adjustment would be EXCEPT it also fixes a host of those DDOS vectors that you are (rightfully) worried about.
@_date: 2016-06-05 23:14:48
A tad under 4 MB;-
@_date: 2016-06-17 00:11:45
There are other ways to game it but in this instance yep.  The other miners have two options;-
1. Header mine and risk that the block is invalid
2. Wait X minutes for the block to verify and mine on that (giving the malicious miner X minutes head start).

@_date: 2015-08-11 23:08:42
Still agree with most of what you are saying ;) .
Hard Drive space is mostly irrelevant as you point out, drives are cheap.  It is good to point out though if you are running on the cloud (like most do) it will cost you ~$384 USD per annum (@ $0.08 from Amazon magnetic storage for 400 MB, not including the bandwidth costs).
What is really going to suck is the more than 8 MB every 10 minutes over everyone's internet connection.  Before you tell me 'but internet is cheap' have a glance around what other people in other countries can get.  I know for sure normal internet connections where I live (New Zealand) just won't cope with it and we are a first world country.
It also magnifies the 'selfish miner' problem and well as orphan blocks.
In short, I say again; Bigger blocks, cool, but it does not solve spam.  
Spam is another problem altogether, we need to be looking to solve that issue not just giving in and giving it more space.

I was gong for the 'extreme overkill' version of the attack.
In reality all you need to do is spend more than the normal transactions.  At the moment there are about 500 KB of them with 0.2 fees and that does not change depending on blocksize.
As I say though, I am all for a block size increase but spam is a different problem.

We lose A LOT of users if we dont, it is why they keep harping on about centralisation.  It is all very good for the people on the upward bandwidth limits to say "we don't care" to the lower bandwith people but there are more of us than there are of you by quite a considerable margin.


Most people here in New Zealand have 30-40 MB caps, you can pay $100 or so to get unlimited.  That is (believe it or not) quite good on a global scale.


It sure is, my upload is less that 512k.
ANyway, we agree on a lot of things, what I am pointing out is that spam IS NOT going to be fixed by larger blocks, it is probably going to make it a lot worse for a lot of people.
Perhaps we should fix that and then move on.  Doing it the other way around is going to exclude a lot of people from bitcoin.

No, they just spread that 20 BTC over 8 MB.

This is where we disagree, you seem to be thinking that with 8x size comes 8x fees from normal transactions.  I am saying that it does not matter what the size is and there will always be only be 1x normal transactions.  That amount is growing but changing the block size does not make it so that there are more normal transactions, just space for more normal (and spam) transactions.
You getting me?  You are getting all aggressive but all we have here is a difference of opinion.


As above, the normal transactions do not increase automatically with the block size, people are going to be making the same amount of transactions.


They would be making 8MB of transactions with those 20 BTC, that is still 100 times the amount of 0.2 BTC that is paid for normal transactions.


Hell, they can fund terrorists and get away with it even when everyone knows.  Crushing a competitor is nothing to them and the shareholders will thank them for protecting their interests.


You would of course buy the bitcoins before you did something like this.  Once it is well underway you could start to pick them up for pennies :( .

The same.  Having larger blocks only allows for more transactions, it does not make them happen.
@_date: 2015-08-07 09:35:04


Currently there are anywhere between 350-400 KB's of transactions every 10 minutes on the entire bitcoin network.  Somewhere about 1,500 short lived connections in that time as well.
I could do that with my shitty home DSL :) .  If you did it as well we would have the entire network covered with redundancy :P .
@_date: 2015-08-16 23:21:42
It is not that hard to work out, lets say they spend a bitcoin per block, the miners will be choking themselves to mine it for them because that a lot more than what they get today, so;-
259.50 (Current USD per bitcoin) * 144 (blocks per day) = $37,368 USD a day
Unfortunately, that number is effective no matter what the block size is because the actual 'organic transactions' do not change and that is the amount they have to beat.

You have me remembering the 'good old days' of the earlyish internet now, I used to have these exact same discussions with people back then (it is just that the internet was useless and will disappear soon though).
Back then, if someone asked if you were on the internet (it did not happen often admittedly) it meant did you have email and that qualified.  The internet was not accessed at from home (some did, but it was expensive, the phone companies used to charge by the minute) and what you would do is get onto a VT-100, logon to a unix box and use that as a gateway.  The machine itself could not even run a calculator by itself let alone fit your definition of being 'on the internet'.

DO you have any evidence of that?
@_date: 2015-08-21 00:40:27


It absolutely will IMO.
When people say that bitcoin is 'internet money' it is very apt, it works great on the internet but there are issues when you are in a physical store making a POS transaction.  Zero confirmation transactions have always been problematic.
The Lightning Network protocol is designed to get around the problem because, as it stands, a double spend is always a possibility.

Increasing the block size by 8 times does not magically make 8 times the normal transactions.
@_date: 2015-08-12 22:46:58
For me it is more of a matter that I don't see a clear road ahead so I would be reluctant to endorse any sort of block size change.
Sure, we will get more transactions per second but we are using less than half of what we have now so the only thing that will be using the extra space is free spam.
I also dont see larger blocks as the 'end solution' to scaling anyway.  To match just one of the big payment networks blocks would have to be huge (500 MB+).  I cannot see how that will work, I think we need to be smarter as to how we do transactions not bigger.  Size is probably going to be a part of it but I very much doubt it is going to be all of the solution.
But yeah, I sit on the fence most of the time.
@_date: 2015-08-06 23:22:22


That may be part of it.  In particular I was alluding to sidechains, the NYSE could create one (probably not bi-directional either) and run all of their transaction through that.

We are in real trouble if bitcoin works as you say it does and every transaction is easily traceable to it owner.
In reality though, if someone buys off an exchange, transfers it out to address A and then on again to address B the exchange can not identify who owns address B.  You would of course be even more cunning than that and transfer some to address C and some to address D and from address C transfer some to address E etc.
Who is going to know (apart from the attacker) who owns address B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J etc upto address ZZZZZ?

We are probably only costing them a few thousand dollars a day in revenue.  At present, we are just not worth it.
I think you are taking me all wrong, you asked a serious question so I gave you a scenario that would kill bitcoin.  If you asked me, I would love to have the block size restriction removed altogether, it is a great idea.  We cannot just abandon all caution and plow ahead though, even changing the block size to 1.1 MB has very serious risks and could be potentially disastrous.
We need to ask the "what if" questions like you are, think about what could happen, fix those problems and THEN do it.
@_date: 2015-08-17 07:25:26
So your side is totally right and their side is totally wrong?
If directly asked I would say I am cautiously for a block size increase but I can see that the other side does have some valid points.  Just ignoring them is akin to putting your fingers in your ears and yelling "I am not listening" repeatedly.

Very easy to work out, let's say they pay 100 times what the fees are now and drop 20 BTC into each block;-
20(BTC) * 144 (blocks per day) * 300 (USD per bitcoin)
$864,000 USD a day.
Miners will be choking themselves to mine that for them.

Not really, when we lay out an application where I work we use MVC and we always make sure that the components are fully separated.  We don't necessarily separate them all at birth but the model is always on a different machine to start with (the db server).
When things start to get loaded the first thing we do is split out the view to separate machines (or a CDN) leaving the controller to do its thing by itself.
It is all how you design your apps though, wordpress has the views and controllers all mixed up so you would be hard pressed to separate them.  Models sit on another machine nicely though.

I imagine most are out of necessity but do we really want to make it worse.


Sorry, used the wrong thing, 30-40 GB caps, i.e. they can download 30 or 40 GB a month.  70 GB would totally blow the cap, I have a 100MB cap because I pay $95 a month so it would be 70% of my cap.  You can get uncapped but the actual bandwidth is horrible.  Shocking isn't it?
Australia is the same and most of the rest of the world is even worse.

Probably true :D .  But going ahead with something that we know is probably not going to work does not seem right to me, especially considering your next point.


In 2 years we will be in trouble if we have not come up with anything but, as you say, that is two years from now.
We are now having the conversations and working on solutions (as we should be).  We also know we don't have an unlimited time to come up with a solution **BUT** that is exactly what we need to work on, a solution not a kudge.

I can answer that one for you, I lived in the UAE for 6 years.
You are extremely unlikely to get citizenship.  It does happen but only when the Sheikh takes notice of you and makes it happen.

Depends on who is doing the attacking.  
If it was me it would be too expensive but some of the traditional payment networks measure their revenue in billions and if they were going to be losing out half a billion a year it is exceedingly cheap.  God forbid if a government wanted to do it.
Because of the pseudo-anonymous nature of bitcoin it would also be next to impossible to work out who as doing it.

I actually care deeply about bitcoin and its future and I spend a lot of time reading and trying to understand its intricacies. 
What worries me is these huge swings in 'public opinion' that may derail it.  A few years back there was a huge panic because the blockchain was too big, now we have outrage that it is too small.  WTF????
People seem to look at bitcoin and think what we see today is what we will have in six months or a year or even 10 years from now.  I suspect (and history is behind me on this) how we use bitcoin in the future will bear little resemblance to what we do now.  We need to calm the fuck down, take our time and make good decisions to get there though, none of this pitchfork wielding **MUST CHANGE NOW!!!** stuff.

No, we pay for it through our taxes...  You want to hear the real kicker about that though?
Our taxes are also substantially less than people pay in the US!  To top it off, we don't have  a dozen or so different entities that can tax us, we have what people in the US would call Payroll Tax and Sales Tax (one set of each, not state, federal etc).
The government does all of our taxes for us to!  We can check to make sure they get it right though and get them to adjust... but only if they owe us something otherwise we don't bother.
But wait, there is more!  When we go overseas to work we only have to pay taxes there.  Unlike US citizens we don't actually have to pay taxes on money that we earn while living overseas to our country of origin.
It may not be a free lunch but at least we are not being ripped off.

One of my favorite quotes;-
"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing."
If you truly see injustice in the way things are there is a long and proud history of "getting off your ass and stop moaning about it".  We have seen that if the people are truly behind you, and the idea is just a few can make a difference.
France, USA, India, South Africa.  Mandala, Gandhi, Malcolm X.

That is just a drop in the ocean to some that may wish to harm bitcoin, lets scale it a bit and say we made 80 MB blocks, that is still only 840,000, what about 800 MB blocks?  Is $8,400,000 a day to expensive?  [Paypal alone]( generated 8.4 BILLION in revinue last year, how much do you think they would spend to protect that?  (Lets not even mention VISA or MasterCard)

A single transaction can fund a side chain forever **IF** it is bi-directional.  If it is using it's own token you don't even need that.

There are actually a few circumstances when small blocks are legitimately made.
Directly after a block is mined there is normaly not a lot left in the mempool so a small block could be generated for example.
It could also potentially be used as an attack vector.

I am not sold on the incompressible fluid idea, sometimes math does not translate back to the physical world all that well (look at elliptic curves or n-dimensional math to see what I mean)


Those 21M can actually be transferred may times inside the same block so it is more like;-
21M * ∞ * ∞V = PQ
And as my old math teacher used to tell me, as soon as you are relying on using ∞ in your equation to produce a result.... well, something is not working right.

Literally no one agrees with you, google it if you don't believe me.  I googled "are sidechains altcoins", there were plenty of results but they were about side chains being the end of altcoins but non saying they were the same thing.


What on earth do you think LN does?  It could literally clear every transaction in a block (or hour) in one go.  A large bank could use one an hour to clear all of its external transactions, how could that not help solve the issue?
In the end, as I said, I am not against an increase but it would just be a temporary hack that kicks the can further down the road.  If we want to actually *solve* the transaction per second problem making bigger and bigger blocks is not the answer and if we try to go down that route we will likely choke bitcoin with its own success.

First, I will commend you on making 2FA a priority before you do anything.  Too many times I have seen people think it is not important or worthwhile, now to your questions;-
1) Yes
2) Yes
Feel better?  I thought not.
Before you go about setting up 2FA you need to ensure that your device itself is secure.  If you have an IOS device make sure it is not rooted.  
If your using Windows phone or Android it is a bit more difficult (there is no code audit for apps yet), check that it is not rooted first and then go through your apps and make sure you trust them.
Even after all that, you are going to end up trusting someone (Apple, Microsoft or Google) but as long as you don't keep your password on your device as well they are still missing a bit of the necessary information.  Make sure you are not using the same password for everything though, that is making it easy for them.

Actually this is the original concept as described in the whitepaper.
There was no mandated blocksize apart from technical limitations.  As it turned out though, Satoshi was worried about an effective DOS attack against bitcoin buy just making huge blocks full of spam so he put the 1 MB limit in.
It was never meant to stay forever (and he never really outlined where he was going with it) but it is meant as an artificial means to provide contention for block space so that spammers won't bring the system to its knees.
@_date: 2015-07-13 05:06:05
Really?  I had never heard that before? /s
Chances of solving a block happen every planck (smallest measurement of time we have), I worked the chance in an hour out for an hour because normal people don't usually think in planck's.

It is not me who made up that model :P .  It is one of those old standard models that economists have been using for decades (centuries perhaps).
The theory is that if I have $1,000,000 and transfer it to you that amount is locked up 'in the system' for however long the transfer takes.  That reduces the available pool of money to be spent by $1,000,000.  If enough people do it all the time (as is the case of the USD) that puts pressure to raise the price.
So, the slower money can be transferred, the lower the velocity.
With bitcoin the model does not work, once someone transaction hits the network someone else can then transact that bitcoin immediately.  Infinite velocity as it were (very fast money).

I agree with most of what you are saying ;) .
However, if your intention is to full up 8 MB blocks it is no more expensive than it was before.  In fact, because of the extra space and absence of fee contention you could probably try to do it with 0 fee transactions.
Bigger blocks solve a lot of issues, spam is not one of them, it may even make spam worse.

That is because bitcoin blocks don't run on a schedule, they use a poisson distribution so that at any particular time the next block will usually happen in 10 minutes.
It does not matter if the last block was 5 hours ago or 30 seconds, the next block is always expected to be 10 minutes away, here is some more reading;-

Eating more spam is not reducing it.  It is just making you fat.




Or it does?




Not at all, a few pools have even come out and directly said that they cannot handle huge blocks.




It really isn't, if we decided tomorrow that every transaction in the world would be represented in the blockchain in it's current state (and somehow managed to try it) we would literally break the internet by broadcasting 10 TB+ blocks to 6,000+ bitcoind's every 10 minutes.

* It encourages decentralization by keeping the running requirements down.
* It puts a cap on the amount of spam that can be generated.
* It is 'the devil we know'.
* Organic transactions seem to sit around 400-500KB at the moment so it is more than enough (for now)
* It allows us to take our time and work out the best way of scaling.
* Miners cannot DDOS each other by making huge blocks.
* No matter how big you make blocks, it is not the answer to scaling anyway.

Velocity when it comes to bitcoin approaches infinity.

You lost me there.  There is no way on earth that bitcoin could handle the 6-700 MB blocks every 10 minutes.  No way, just cannot be done.

You are not Gavin ;) .  That said, even Gavin wouldn't say we are ready for VISA levels, even his most optimistic estimation (20 MB) are about 300 times below that.
There have been a few studies/surveys about how big the blocks can be, Jonathan Toomim did the most comprehensive one (  ) and what it seems to indicate is that right now with the technology we have things start to break up at about 3-4 MB.  Propagation &amp; CPU seem to be the biggest breaking points at the moment.
So, as you say, 2 MB is probably OK.... the problem is do we do SegWit first or after.
Why a lot of people think SegWit and then 2 MB is because together they add up to a 3.2 MB block under low SegWit uptake, if we get a lot of SigOp's in a block that size could easily creep above the 4 MB (or even 6MB ) limit leading to issues.
The thought is to get SegWit in place with all of the optimisations working correctly (it may take some tweaks) and that will make it safe(er) to be doing the much larger blocks 2 MB + SegWit will give us.
The real stinker is though we only ever get to do this once, if we screw the pooch now there are no take backs, it is screwed.  We make a big mistake with P2SH/leveldb we don't want to do that again.
Measure twice and cut once is very appropriate here.

The real problem is that there is absolutely no way to know what percentage of what support what using node counts.
Apart from most nodes not even showing up on sites like that (there is probably 30-40 times that amount of nodes) people may be running 20 or 30 nodes by themselves.  On top of that it is relatively simple to fire up tens of thousands of pseudo-nodes (or just the occasional sneaky few) to totally distort the numbers.  Even worse, people have been known to DDOS and knock clients they don't like off the network.
It is a crappy metric and that is even without 'creative interpretation' ;) .

I would argue that it takes more effort/expertise to run psudo nodes.  Downloading/installing and running normal node software is well within the technical ability of even the most basic user.
However, someone with a bit of expertise could build a docker instance as a psudo node and script it up to fire up in a few hundred free AWS/RackSpace/GoogleApp/Azure/Whatever accounts all with multiple individual IP addresses.

Basically yeah,  since it is in the mempool, it can't be a consensus rule, there is just no way to enforce rules on things that can, and do, have an indeterminate state between nodes.  It is not because we don't want to, it is because until they are in a block we cannot enforce any rules.


Not really since only one side can do the bidding in both cases.


Better you found out now then after someone 'broke' it for you ;) .


Yeah, LN will enable you to have instant transactions with 100% safety.  Even micro transactions will be covered.

You have two options;-
1. Start reading into the 'depths' of bitcoin, github, IRC, mailing lists etc (not reddit so much)  and get more information.  There is LOTS going on and some of it is very cool.
2. Don't worry too much about it.
Either option is valid ;) .

No, most DDOS's don't actually get to the point of asking permission for anything.
For example in a standard DNS Amp attack the victim just gets millions of huge packets on a port.  What is doing the DOS is the large amount of data being transferred not necessarily the processing that needs to be done to the packets received (though, there can be exploitable DOS's in processing as well).

@_date: 2016-02-10 06:06:37


That is what that means.  When you mine a block you mine it complete with the transactions that it contains.
Part of the 'game theory' behind mining is making sure that it is worth while for miners to include transactions in blocks at all.  There are some circumstances where you can make it so that it is to the advantage of the miner to mine only 1 transaction blocks by making them very expensive in CPU time to validate (and therefore propagate).
Obviously that is something to avoid so it is very important not to make it advantageous for them.
@_date: 2016-02-09 00:58:49


I get that, and I am glad you get that too.  Surely though, you must realise that increasing the blocksize to get to VISA levels will **NEVER** work, we cant just bump the blocksize to 1 TB and say, "there, fixed".
In order to get to those levels we have to be smarter, bigger blocksizes are probably part of the equation but only a small part.

Not really, only yesterday I saw a tutorial about how to setup a free AWS instance with a classic node built in.  Would you say they counted?  If someone did it with a few thousand accounts does that mean a few thousand votes for one side or another?
Node counts are meaningless, it can be manipulated by anyone very easily.  It is important to note I am not saying that because 'my side' is loosing, there are far more satoshi nodes out there, I am saying because it is a bogus metric.


My hope is we never get to the point that an average user in the first world cannot run a node, we have the technology, we know how to do it, there is a path so that we can run VISA level transactions on the bitcoin network and keep it decentralized so that you and I can keep running nodes.  We just have to be able to implement it without 'popular votes' overruling us to do what is popular and not what is right.

This.  
A few months back it was the bitcoin foundation, before that it was pool centralisation, before that the blockchain was to big (ironic), before that Gavin was a CIA plant, before that unlimited block sizes encouraged spam (Satochi fixed that with 1MB blocks), before that developers were going broke so we started a foundation to pay them.....
The way things go about in circles to the exact opposite in a cycle my guess for the next crisis is that developers are hiring on to startups and have a conflict of interest and we should have a "bitcoin foundation" to pay them.

Not random at all, it is a hash of the block that meets certain difficulty requirements.
Those 000's you see at the beginning is because the hash was 'close enough' to surpass the difficulty without being the exact hash value for the block.

It increases the available block space by segregating the signature data.

You are not wrong, you are missing a bit of the picture though.
They are actually separate but complementary technologies but they are used by different parties, the Sender can use Replace By Fee and the Receiver cannot.  Whereas the Receiver can use Child Pays for Parent and the sender cannot.
Just in case you are about to ask this;-


I suspect we already have it.  Just like I suspect we have been seeing RBF for years now (well before the Opt-In bit added today) because these changes are mode in the mempool of the mining nodes and are not actually consensus rules.  It makes sense that miners are seeking greater rewards and they can do it without us even knowing.

It sounds good doing more things at once doesn't it?  I mean, if we are doing one thing to scale, doing two at the same time must be better right?
I am not sure if you code but it is one of the fundamental 'rules' is that you only ever change one thing at a time, test thoroughly, fix the problems and then move onto the next thing.  If you change more than one thing it often becomes uncertain what change caused a problem or even if it is some unforeseen interaction between the changes.
It's going to be a balancing act, kind of like jenga, it isn't something to rush, screwing the pooch and getting a mulligan is not an option.

Because you are comparing all nodes in one camp with only the latest of others.  A lot of people (like me and Mini below) are running older versions, there is nothing wrong with that though, we are still running core so we should still count.
@_date: 2016-02-10 23:52:51


Well, the road-map is nothing new, it has been common knowledge to anyone who follows bitcoin close enough for quite some time now.  SegWit is also quite old news, it has been operational in testing for close to a year now.
What is actually new is the movement to bypass the development process that was setup ~7 years ago.
@_date: 2016-02-10 05:45:56
It is actually fairly simple.
When a block is found and transmitted there is a period of time as it propagates across the network being validated.
During that time miners will often stop mining the previous block and start mining on the headers of the block that is propagating.  Because they don't have the full information on the block they cant be sure that transactions they have are included in that propagating block or not.  So if they include any transactions and that were in the propagating block any block they mine will be invalid.
So, they mine on empty blocks until they can be 100% sure of the sate of the network.  The single transaction is the one paying them the 25 BTC.
That is why you usually see those 1 transaction blocks very soon after the previous block.
@_date: 2016-02-03 00:02:02


No, the transaction replaces the old one in the mempool (hence the replace in Replace By Fee).

No, even the tiny difference in calculating the merkle tree (sort of the inventory of the transactions) is insignificant so it is not an issue, you have to do it if you have 1 or 10,000 transactions.

Heh, I disagree with fairly much everything you said :P .  From my point of view;-
* Increasing block size is another issue altogether.  In this instance it will probably harm the blockchain by eliminating fee contention (it is not to far into the future when securing the network will need to depend on fees) and we will just end up with 8 MB blocks full of spam.
* I think filtering is probably the answer, we need to take a page from the email playbook and start to work smart classifiers into bitcoin itself in order to correctly identify and block spam attacks.
* Fixing fees fixes the target for spammers, there needs to be a way of, in the worst case senario, outbidding the spammers in order to get your transaction through.

They could stop transactions confirming.  It would be a pain in the ass but they cannot steal your bitcoins or duplicate them or anything.

No I am not.
View keys can be used to somewhat alleviate the problem but you still have chain of ownership issues.  Bitcoin makes some things very clear and easy to prove, Monero, not so much.

Just as bitcoin is not the same thing as traditional currencies.


Why did the internet replace libraries?  Same reason.


Bitcoin does not change currencies, it just makes currencies more accessible. (See what I did there?)

I don't think so, he is probably referring to what Satoshi actually said before he left.
His origin vision was for mining to be done by bitcoin nodes using their CPU's.  Pools, GPU's and ASIC's were something of a surprise.  He actually suggested we all enter a 'gentlemans agreement' not to use them;-

Only in a very broad sense.  Say I have an address that has 9 coins in it and then transfer another 1 in.  Because there are no actual coins that 1 is now indistinguishable from the other 9 so if you wanted to 'lock' that coin from creating outputs you would have to lock the entire 10.
You may think 'cool, lets do that' but the implications are quite horrible.  For example, if I had one of your addresses that you had 1,000 BTC in it I could just lock it by transferring some satochis in every now and then :^( .  There are other implications that I could name and probably lots more that would not become evident until such a change went through.


Feel free to bounce ideas off me, as someone that is actively using/developing in bitcoin I put a lot of thought into the area.
@_date: 2015-04-15 20:29:29


That is why I added the hard bit in brackets.  View Key's go part of the way to alleviate the problem but still leave chain of ownership issues.
People seem to have taken my comment as "I hate Monero" and that is far from the truth.  I am just saying "It is not the perfect tool for everything".  I am fairly sure that given the option I would want it in bitcoin but I am also fairly sure that I would not want it as default.

For a start it effectively breaks eCommerce (or just makes it hard depending on your point of view)
Say for example I am a vendor selling internet widgets and you buy 10,000 BTC worth.  In this scenario I am also a scamming dirt bag ;) .
You, in good faith send me the 10,000 BTC and I say "I never received it".  You say "I am going to sue you" and I say, good luck proving it.  
Since all transactions would anonymised you're stuffed.  With bitcoin you have a clear transaction trail.

Miners set a threshold.  As soon as the threshold is reached they get a payout (0.01 BTC for example).

I really think some sort of name to address resolution is needed for bitcoin, however I have a few concerns with this way of doing it;-
1. It encourages address reuse.
2. The 'names' are going to be gibberish (i.e. something like 1992b if it ever gets large scale adoption.  Easier to remember than an address but still not easy to remember.
3.  Te secondary market for onenames will be the new cybersquatter paradise.
I may be talking shit though ;) .  I have not dug too deeply into onename, have you already addressed these issues?

Thanks for challenging me on this, here is my math;-
First, a quick sum to work out how many transactions we can do now, it is about 3 transactions per sec under normal conditions so in any 600 second block (10 minutes) we can do 1800 transactions for the 1 MB (3 * 600 = 1800).
Next, I looked at visa and their transactions per second.  [According to their literature it can do 56,000/s.]( so that is 33,600,000 tranactions for that 10 minute period.
So, to scale bitcoin to that, we need bitcoin blocks to be 18666.6666667 times bigger (33,600,000 / 1800).
So  18.6667 GB Blocks.... I wonder where I got 700 GB from????  Can someone check my math?  I may be brainfarting.
**EDIT:** Already spotted one error, fixed now.

I worked out a while ago to keep up with just VISA today we need ~~~700~~ ~ 18 GB blocks (and that is just VISA).
While bigger blocks are almost certainly the future of bitcoin we cannot rely on them to solve scaling issues.  Fortunately there are other things in the works that in combination with block size may do the trick.
**EDIT:** Revised estimate below it may only be 18.6667 GB, please check my maths.
@_date: 2015-09-12 23:30:11
It would be trivial to generate all of the onename addresses then.
While that is not technically address reuse it still has most of the disadvantages.  
Like I say though and crew may already have solutions to these problems.  He may be back later to discuss them and put me straight :P .
@_date: 2015-04-30 21:00:01


Yeah, but OP_RETURN is the only way to do it in such a way that it is actually coherent data.  I can say there is porn in my swap file if you use a selective algorithm to find match for the data I am looking for.


You are and they don't.  OP_RETURN is non-standard and not necessary.  It in theory is like a memo field between two people making a transaction and while they need it no one else does.  It is not intended as a permanent store of data.


Perge em all :P .  Like I say, you don't need to have them.  You could write something to selectively purge stuff but as I say, there is no reason for it to be kept unless it is your own data.
I actually think OP_RETURN is never going to say around for the exact reasons you are talking about, someone sooner or later is going to be a dick (probably followed by thousands of other dicks) and screw up this 'nice to have' field for us.
It makes me very dubious of anybody that is building a business that is dependant on it like Factum.

@_date: 2015-09-13 01:00:37


So do I.  I spend a lot of time thinking about it.
1.  Address reuse is mainly a privacy issue.  If someone knows what addresses you use they can get a fairly good idea of the state of your finances, where you spend your money, where it is coming from and how much you have.
2. Onenames are unique so it is going to end up like gmail addresses.  I want neil but so do a few million other people so we all have to pick something else.  That something else cannot have already been picked by the millions of other neil's so I end up with something like neil1971bob  Like I said, easier to remember than an address but still not good.
3. The domain name system has a problem, people buy up domains in hoping to sell them.  Onename will be the same except it will be even more difficult to police.  I could get Microsoft, IBM or NASA and there would be nothing that they could do about it apart from pay my extortion fee.
I will add another too;-
4. Fraudulent onenames similar to the original (MicroSoft instead of Microsoft for example) can be created and used to rip people off, it looks legit after all.

Not for most people.


If anonymity is your goal, yeah, that is about the best option.  Even then it is hard to withdraw large amounts of cash (depending on where you live etc..).
I have never liked the "find someone in person" option all that much if your goal is anonymity, putting it all through one person just doubles the 'large amount of cash' problem, not only do you have it, he now has it too.  Either of you could get tripped up and made to reveal the other.

The block was less than a minute after the previous one.
In order for the pool to keep mining they start a new block with 1 transaction in it (the reward).  Over time transactions will work their way into the block but if it is found immediately it just has the single transaction.

A 'wc -l' (linux command to count lines) shows **322,692** nodes available in the last 30 days.

Just as it says, the reddit admins (not the mods) have shadowbanned you.
You need to talk to them about it (Link above).  Your posts are unlikely to be seen by anyone until you sort it out with them.
From the look of the other posts in this thread and the upvotes you have received while no one else can see it I would guess it is for vote manipulation.  They really don't like it when you make up other accounts to upvote your own stuff and comment.

That is why I said sort of, it is the best measurement people have come up with.  
The issue lies in that there aren't any actual 'coins' to track so it is easy to fudge things with a bit of address re-use or the fact that you don't really know if the coins spent was actually spent or just transferred from one address to another.

Ease of use.  Bitcoin has come a long way but it is still hard/intimidating buying and using it for the average punter.  Think of the internet during the 80's.


A bit, I don't let it stop me but it is always niggling in the back of my mind that in 10 years, if we get adoption, the price of bitcoin is going to be ridiculous.


The only bitcoin refund I ever received was from ButterFly labs...  That was painful for reasons other than bitcoin.


No.  We tend to get a bit tunnel visioned about this I think but the chances of world governments getting together and deciding on something like banning bitcoin is slim to none.  They cannot even agree on who are the bad guys let alone on something that is agenda neutral.


Depends, if you are a merchant it is great, if you are a consumer it is not so good, my rule of thumb is don't buy off anyone that does not have a few names of real people and a brick and mortar address.  It has worked so far for me.


Not particularly, there are a lot of people that will just follow what media says but what media is saying has changed a lot in the last few years.  


Not me personally.  Bitcoin is actually fairly good at keeping your transactions out of the view of governments (if used correctly) but having said that if I am audited I don't actually have anything to hide so I am probably not the target audience for this question ;) .

I think you have summed up your experience quite nicely.  For you, bitcoin is not 'there yet'.  There is no harm in that, it is just the way it is (people are going to downvote you for your opinion though, just warning you ;P ).
It is the same for most people out there.
I do recommend you keep an eye on bitcoin though, all of the issues that you are having are true for today but probably not the future.  Spare a thought as to how it was only a few years back, there were no ATM's, you could not link your bank account or use a credit card.  Hell, localbitcoin vendors had 50-100 percent markups at one time!
Bitcoin is building an entirely new banking infrastructure from the ground up and is facing lots of resistance but it is getting there, step by step.  Who knows what it will be like in five or ten years time.

We will have to disagree, there are problems with bitcoin but collection marketing information is not going to be one of them in my opinion.
For every right bit of information they guess (but don't know they got right) they will gain about 10 wrong bits of information that looks identical.  I am not in marketing so I don't really know but there is probably a lot more accurate information sources out there like google searches that will be far more accurate making the '10% maby right' information they can get out of taints.
I mean, if I was given the choice between '100% accurate' and '10% sorta right maybe with 90% wrong' I would not even bother with the latter.

Not everyone is here for the libertarian ideology.  
For instance I am mostly interested in the programmable money aspect.  Others are interested as a speculation vehicle and still others are here for the anonymity side.  The list goes on.

@_date: 2015-11-17 01:48:04


And they would be wrong, I don't keep all my bitcoin in a single address.


Only if you start tainting you addresses with your other addresses, in my case if I used the same payment provider more than once they will always see a new address that has never been tainted with my other addresses.  It will be the same for any transaction I make with any provider.
As I said, if you start reusing addresses it is a different beast but you really should not be doing that.


Grow up, if you can't handle a disagreement without resorting to name calling you should just say nothing at all.
@_date: 2015-11-17 04:42:46
I am a technical person as well, I too could build a system with access to BitPay and Coinbase's databases to track bitcoins and people spending them.
If someone then asked me how accurate it is I would have to say "not very" and if you were honest with me you would probably say the same.  Most of the useful information would be in the databases and not the blockchain and it would be missing a VAST majority of the data.  I, for instance, have never used bitpay or coinbase so I would be totally invisible to the system.
As soon as you start mining the blockchain for information it gets distorted exponentially every step you take.  It would be a rumor machine.  Certainly nothing accurate enough to act upon.
Pretending that I don't understand you is just childish.  If all you want to do is believe in your superiority go ahead but I don't buy into you petty games.  It does irritate me that you feel you have to keep lowering yourself though.

Not by default.  Where you can run into problems is when you promote XT in order to break bitcoin consensus (and I did not think you were trying to do that) but XT and consensus, at the core, are two different things.  One is a bitcoin daemon and the other is the rules that govern bitcoin.
It does not just apply to XT breaking consensus either, if someone came here and tried to promote breaking consensus (increasing the block reward to 1000 BTC for example) we would be removing it as 'not bitcoin' as well.  However, when something like BIP 101 (or 1000 BTC blocks) does reach consensus they will be automatically be 'bitcoin' and be the norm here. 
Just incase you are wondering how we (the mods) define consensus, we don't.  Bitcoin developers do that via what is now called libconsensus and the accepted BIP's.

The way I use addresses (and you should to) there is no link between them at all, it goes from someone else  ==&gt; me ==&gt; someone else .  No link to any of my other addresses.
The problem comes when you engage in the all too common practice of reusing addresses, THEN your funds addresses start to get linked to each other and yeah, you have a problem.  Just don't do that.

Good point about the gold standard.  I am in the camp that it was not actually deflationary in the terms of currency though.  Throughout its history they adjusted the "currency to gold" ratio on several occasions thereby introducing inflation (whereas the supply was *almost* fixed, the currency to gold conversion wasn't).
With bitcoin that cannot happen, there is nobody out there to set the ratios, it will be a true deflationary currency.  By saying that, I am not guaranteeing it will work, I am saying we have not done it like that before.

Yeah, Roger is very passionate about his libertarian views and while bitcoin fits very well into his &amp; the libertarian worldview it is only one aspect to bitcoin so if you don't like it don't let it turn you off.  That is his thing and more power to it but it does not have to be your thing.
What I like about my programmable money is that I can write software to actually transact value in the same way as the internet transmits information.  For me it is the missing link to the internet that, while we knew we needed, did not know how to do.

Like you, they don't have a very good hold on the depths of the bitcoin protocol.  It is an easy mistake, we think of bitcoins like money and money has serials so they can be tracked.

And the problem with stealth addressees are;-
* Require additional client and server infrastructure.
* You can scan the blockchain for matching inputs to your outputs to reveal the destination address.
* The destination address is always the same encouraging address reuse.

SPV clients like electrum need a bit of "extra data" that the normal bitcoind does not maintain, so yeah, it is that complicated sorry.

If you want to talk about things like that starting of with hyperbole like you did will not lead to a conversation based in reality.

Not even close.  So far things that have been flung at bitcoin have been disastrous and we are lucky that we have avoided them (20 MB blocks!).  Worse is the push to bring some sort of popular voting into bitcoin development.
The whole argument is so badly misrepresented I am not surprised that people like you have been so drastically manipulated and are still trying to defend it.
Now, we have people who are either dishonest or just don't know what they are doing attacking bitcoin for (probably) selfish reasons (M.Hearn &amp; R.Ver).

Lots of reasons, margin trading, vendor selloffs, people entering, people leaving, miners paying their bills.  There is not much 'depth' in the market so you can make a big dip or spike with a relatively small amount.
As time goes on it is hoped that this will reduce.  It has so far, once upon a time you could see 10,000 BTC half or double the 'price'.  Thankfully those days are long gone.


THey are playing the long game.  If bitcoin 'works' it is hard to guess how much it could be worth.  I keep a simple thought in the back of my head, when bitcoin is 'there' no more that 21 million people will have over 1 BTC.  In reality it will be far fewer.  Just by simple supply and demand the price of a bitcoin could be quite large.


I would recommend you don't.  I firmly believe that bitcoin is to succeed but I would not invest a significant amount, I have an amount that makes me comfortable and you should probably do the same (whatever that may be).
**EDIT:**  The above is my opinion only, you can't have it and need to formulate your own :P .

Are there any planned solutions to prevent all these ransoms via the Internet?
After all, the internet is the root of the problem.

That does help mitigate the problem.  (No guarantee though)

It is RIPE-MD160 that imposes that limit, it is used to hash your public key to make it a bit more readable (it also provides more security as long as you don't re-use addresses).

The process of verifying (not mining) a block is actually a relatively simple thing and does not change depending on the transactions, size and the other variables in a block.

We hit each other up for reasons behind decisions all the time to keep ourselves as honest as possible, no one is exempt, and if we agree to reverse a decision it is the person that made the decision that does it because we have agreed to it.  Even if a mod disagrees with everyone else it isn't a problem as long as they don't go all rogue and start making up policy by themselves.

You keep answering yourself quite well but I will annotate it a bit for you.


They are unlikely that they ever will, in its history so far they have been decreased 3 times so far and the latest change is to more of a dynamic system that looks at the current que of transactions waiting to confirm and makes a guess at what will get the transaction confirmed.  At least that is how bitcoin-core does it.
So yeah, fairly much your question as a statement.
It is important to note, that even though the fees have reduced in terms of bitcoin the actual  spending power is increasing with the price of bitcoin.
It is hoped that even as the actual total reward in terms of bitcoin decreases halving by halving until we reach some sort of equilibrium the spending power of those rewards actually increases in order to make the network more secure.
The next halving is going to be very interesting.
@_date: 2016-05-02 04:39:13


Yeah, but it still isn't his property.  To transfer property from one person to another it needs to be intentional, i.e. the party needs to be aware of the transfer of property.  Otherwise you can just go picking up tools out of someone's garden shed and say "hey, it is mine now because I control it".


I am not stupid, you meant offence by saying that I am unaware of history and now you are backpedaling.  You were calling me ignorant of something that is entirely irrelevant to what we are talking about (war).  It is called sidetracking and it is a tool of trolls to 'win arguments' by insult.   You should hold yourself to better standards than that.
@_date: 2016-05-27 00:08:47
I see it has a confirmation on it already BUT smallish transactions like that often take some time.
As transactions get smaller and smaller in terms of satoshi's (0.00000001's) they get less and less efficient and miners and their settings start to get in the way.  One of the Lightning Networks features is to improve on this.

You are relying on a spectacular series of coincidences that a change address is always used for the following transaction in a chain until the next time you use the provider.  Even so, the provider cannot guarantee that those coins have been in my custody all that time.  If it were to go in front of a judge with someone trying to prove something a law student could pick it to pieces.  I am sure you could as well.  (It would have to be an amazing set of coincidences though)


It actually leaks a lot of information and none of it is reliable if you are using addresses correctly.  Just about every address with bitcoin in it is tainted with the first 'pizza transaction' including mine.  Does that mean I ate the pizza?  No.

Sort of.  Stealth addresses are really only useful for a limited set of use cases and require additional infrastructure at the client and server end. 
You can also monitor the blockchain for the matching outputs and because all payments end up in the same address you can uncover the destination address.  
Dont get me wrong, I think we are hunting around the solution here.  Being able to send bitcoins using someone's email address is going to be great.  It is something that I have been putting a lot of thought into recently.

No worries, I just wanted to be sure we are changing subjects.  It can lead to misunderstandings talking about more than one thing at a time so I like to draw a line to separate conversations/ideas/concepts.
So, the alt coin thing!
To understand it properly we have to do a bit of history delving.
Back at the beginning of bitcoin it did not take long for altcoins to arise, first namecoin and then it instantly exploded into thousands of other blockchains.  Some even had a lot of things in common with bitcoin but with a few tweaks like the genesis block, hashing algorithm, proof of work.  Some even shared the same blockchain (so coins existed in both) but had other differences.  So, at the time we defined bitcoin something like this (this is stolen for a rules update I am working on in an effort to make things clear);-


It basicly all hinges around bitcoin consensus and bitcoin development, it/they are the people that define what bitcoin is and is not (not us mods).
So, if something follows the rules of bitcoin and follows bitcoin consensus it is, as far as we are concerned, bitcoin.  If it doesn't, it is not.  Simple as that.
If consensus says that blocks are 1 MB, if your blockchain doesn't have (currently or in the future) 1 MB blocks it is not bitcoin.  If you change bitcoin consensus so that blocks are 2 MB (for example) that is bitcoin and something that limits to 1 MB blocks is an altcoin.
It is fairly useless to rage at us mods (as people like to do) because we are not in charge of bitcoin consensus.  You can talk about changing the block size (or any other factor in bitcoin) but as soon as you start promoting that everyone go off and download a client that doesn't follow consensus they are actually promoting an altcoin and it doesn't belong in (like all other altcoin discussion).

The problem is, used correctly bitcoin is quite good at anonymizing things all by itself.
The issues of people discovering your spending mostly come from re-using addresses and publishing your addresses in silly places (twitter).  If the DoJ or whoever it was handled those silk road coins correctly no one would have never known what ones they were or who they went to.
Instead they lumped them all into one address revealing all of the 'input addresses' and then transferred them out to addresses that one guy had even published.... on twitter.
How it should work if you transfer your bitcoins (to them for example) they sit there until they are spent again, not consolidated into a big holding address.  While you may see that they have moved the coins you don't know if it is to another of their addresses, a supplier, a contractor or just the normal hookers and blow ;) .  (Providing the hookers don't tweet their addresses that is)

This has been brought up a lot, I think fairly much everyone agrees it would be a good thing but the real question is how?
@_date: 2015-10-04 23:29:52
You should be fine.  It is an old vulnerability but a bit of a sticky one to fix.
What the attacker can do is change the transaction ID of a transaction (he actually just trys to replace the transaction with another one with a new ID).
While he can try to do that, he cannot actually replace what is inside the transaction so the actual transfer of bitcoins still takes place even if he is successful.  He cannot transfer them to another address or stop them transferring or anything.
@_date: 2015-11-16 20:04:40
Ahh, OK, I see where you are coming from.
You need to remember though, what you are doing is not the normal use case and what you are doing is re-using addresses (I know, with mining it is hard to avoid).
However using your 4 digit addresses (good idea to illustrate it) a normal transaction of mine would look like;-
1112 ===&gt;  1113  ===&gt; 1114
Where 1112 &amp; 1114 are someone else's addresses and 1113 is my address  People with 1114 can look at that transaction and say 1113 is my address but if they said 1112 was my address they would be wrong.
Change addresses are special because the bitcoin spend two hops in my custody but they look identical to the above case so no one can tell the difference and tell me what addresses are mine and what ones aren't.
But yeah, re-using addresses is very common (and hard to avoid in some circumstances) but that is not how you should be doing it.  You cannot really blame bitcoin for something that the users are not doing right, having said that, we should (and are) working towards making it easier for the user to do the right thing.
It certainly is not as OP said, everyone can easily find out how much I own and what I spend it on.

25 * 6 * 24 * 7 = 25,200 BTC mined in a week, that is your supply.
100,000 * 10 = 1,000,000 BTC a week would be your demand.
Realistically, if that level of supply/demand ever came about there is no way supply would ever keep up even with 'people cashing out'.  All of the sell order book on all of the exchanges would be empty and people STILL would not get their 10 BTC each.

No sorry, when you get to $10,000 you need to prove where you got the fund from and what you are going to use it for.

You cant make a transaction without the coinbase;-

@_date: 2015-03-29 01:34:04


It is not something that the average user can do either.  They could get someone else to do it as a service but then you have to give that service your private key.




Say you have a stealth address and I have generated an address for it.  If I send 0.33227766 to it I can then scan the blockchain for an address with that as an input.


Let me clarify, while the destination address is different each time the receiving address where the coins arrive is always the same.  At least that is my understanding after having played with them a bit.

What puts me off both solutions is that DNS is a static record set.  Any addresses that you put in there will also be static and cached.
Don't get me wrong though, I firmly believe that we need a "email to address" resolver and both solutions are hunting in the right directions.

@_date: 2015-03-31 06:01:58
Well..... it is quite easy to check, I will take you through the steps.
1. Go to the website where the firmware is here 
2. Grab the SHA1, it is **1d203522b5437309c1f0c15749844d3692e17e1c**
3. Go here  and select sha1 and drag and drop your file.
**Checked, your file reads 71AC8668438594BABC77B4F2D8DE6F2EC0DE77E5 .....   Bummer.**
That does not necessarily something bad is up, the version on the website is 1.1 and they don't have the sha1 for any other versions.
Might be an idea to contact support ;)

You would but I feel that am fairly sure the confidence level would drop exponentially as the 'hop' count increases.  Even a simple transaction like a=&gt;b=&gt;c what confidence can you give that a is the same player as c?  If you are using addresses correctly it should be 0% chance that I am both a and c.
The change address is the wild card but it no normal circumstances should it have forked back into the transaction to c.


Covered in Above


Totally agreed, contaminating your own coins is about the worst thing you can do.


If your community taint their coins on a regular basis, sure.


True, even better though, if everyone used their addresses correctly the community would be a mixer in itself.


If you mean that there is a problem when people don't use bitcoin correctly or use shitty wallets (blockchain.info) I would agree and I would line up behind you with a pitchfork.  But that is not a problem with bitcoin and it is one easily avoided.
As to the original point where the user said it is easy for anyone to find out how much bitcoin I have and and what I spend it on I still say it is fudding BS.  It is the kind of fear people use to push various altcoins and it is an outright lie.
@_date: 2015-03-15 23:06:45

Nope, never has been, refer back to the P2SH debate as an example.
Consensus was reached though even though it was not unanimous and we moved forward with that new consensus.  We did not split into OP_EVAL/P2SH//CODEHASHCHECK camps and all campaign through social media, we stuck with the process that has been bitcoin consensus since the beginning.
That is the process, always has been and hopefully always will be.
Subverting the process via social media campaigns is not (or ever should be) the way to change consensus.


It has always been allowed, no need to open anything.

It does distort the top end though, if you look at the chart without realizing that it is log it looks like that the average block is about 99% full.

 I am actually amazed that people that should know better (CoinBase &amp; BTC-E) have actually reacted at all to this and their doing so has caused a lot of confusion for people, it seems like they are saying that they can differentiate one bitcoin from another.
What needs to happen is that the thief needs to get caught in custody of the private keys of the addresses that were used in the initial theft.  THAT is irrefutable damning evidence.  
Anything else will get torn to pieces by anyone with a good knowledge of how bitcoin works.

There is no denying that unfortunately.
I have been hearing this argument decades though and its been going on for centuries.  In the early 90's there were actually people who wanted to stop the internet because it made some crimes easier.  Before you and I were born there was a group of people called the luddites who wanted technology banned because it took away their jobs.
When motorcars were first catching on people passed all sorts of red flag laws to stop them (My favorite was that if you came across livestock you had to dismantle your cars and hide it in the bushes).
There are people who will always try to misuse new technology and there is little we can do about it (unless we dismantle it and hide it in a bush).

The chances of two different people generating the same set of keys is so astronomically remote ( 1 in 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976)  the only likely explanation is that there is some bug in the generation process where it will generate the same address twice.

My opinion?
Following standards are a good thing BUT I have to go with Thomas on this occasion.
I am actually doing some work with BIP32/44/39 and I 'accidentally' did exactly what Thomas did with electrum, I included a version number.  It was a few weeks later that I discovered electrum did the same.
My app is still on v1 so it is BIP39 compliant but it could use a different wordlist in the future and because versions are included there won't be a conflict.

Someone else takes 1,000 beans out of the pot, now prove that he has stolen beans.
Now let's make it accurate, imagine there is only a ledger of beans coming in and out and that 1,000 beans coming out (and the 100 stolen ones going in) is only in a ledger, now prove that the person has stolen beans.  (Very hard since the person does not actually have ANY beans)

Hi dude, you appear to be shadowbanned.
You need to talk to the reddit admins about it because your posts wont get through.

That is not a bad idea but no one has been banned yet under the new policy.  We wanted to get this out there so that no one would feel like they had been trapped.
I will start collection posts of bad posts right now (removing the user, we don't want them harassed).

Cool, now I have you attention I will help you make a post that wont get deleted by the moderators.
First of all, do not make up users to up vote your own threads and leave positive comments.
Second, if your thread does not get through because of the first thing, don't make up other accounts to post it again.
What you need to do is make a post and then let the readers upvote or downvote and comment on it as they decide.
If you want to submit again, post a link here and I will approve it but the second you start trying to manipulate it again with sock-puppet accounts it will be gone and the admins will be notified.

They do, you report them to the admins.  It may feel like a shitty thing to do to your own users but for the sake of keeping things civil I have done it.
As a general rule, I remove anything that does not have a np. link on it and even then if it seems that there might be bregading going on I inform the admins.  They have to tools to actually see if it is going on and they will shadowban the offenders (this is why your shadowban rules concern me, they are reddit admin tools to stop this stuff and it seems like you are circumventing the reddit admins).

I am 100% to blame here, I have never agreed with the trolling policy.  When I became a mod and after seeing how some people are treated around here and how some seem to be immune to the bannhamer I started up a complain in mod mail to do something about it.
We have community giants that no longer want to reddit, developers get trolled to bits (Mike &amp; Gavin included) and anyone who wants to say something slightly controversial gets hammered.  That is what I want to put a stop to.
About XT, you may not know this about me but I run XT on one of my nodes.  It is to support one of the Lighthouse servers that I run (Mikes's project).  I have even contributed code and documentation to lighthouse.  If I was out to get XT users I would be shooting myself in the foot.

Yeah, when buying that is the cash advance fee from your credit card, I get charged that too.  It is MC charging you that not circle.
@_date: 2015-02-02 06:30:09
Not realy.  I remember back in 1989 when I got my first email address going on and on (and on) to my co-workers and boss at the time how the internet is going to take the world by storm.
When I actually tried to get them into it after configuring the modem, dialing, logging in, starting ppp, getting an IP address, open my mail/news reader (it all took about an hour JUST TO LOG IN) they said;-
 "The internet is too confusing for just anyone to use." 
And yeah, back then it was ;) .
@_date: 2015-10-17 02:27:05
No,  When  you buy with a credit card there is a direct link to the fact you bought bitcoin on your credit card statements.
Buying with cash you have a cash withdrawal on you statement and that is it.
However, tumblers are not as great as you would imagine.  Chances are, you give your bitcoins that have been linked with a legal buy and get back bitcoins that could be linked with drugs or crime or whatever and the bitcoins you just sent them and are linked to you go on to be used to do something 'bad'.  (if the tumbeler gives you back anything at all that is).
You are far better just to use the bitcoins properly (don't reuse addresses and once someone knows what your address is, move your coins).

It is a reference to the second law of thermodynamics where energy lost is represented by entropy.
You are right though, it is not just gone but some of it is lost in such a way that it is not really energy anymore (it is spread out particles).
While matter is still energy (E=MC^2 and all) and nothing is *really* lost you can still say that the energy is lost and is now matter arranged in a different way.  Quantum theory has a different take on it (currently) but..... yeah, that is all particle accelerators and magic at the moment :P .

That was the plan, and then GPU's and ASIC's came along.


One of the biggest problems is how can you tell if someone is actually running a node or just running a few thousand application proxies to a node.  One guy did exactly that to show that node counts were meaningless.  He spun up a few thousand XT nodes and then switched them to core after a few hours.
They behave exactly the same as a normal node does.

Use the same solution for both, print them out and keep them in your mattress.


Can you automatically reverse a cash transaction?  


Modern day cash has serial numbers, what are they for?
  


I agree, there are some differences here, while bitcoin transactions are instant they take some time to confirm (usually 10 minutes).  If you want to transfer me cash it would take days.  Bitcoin is the clear winner here!

@_date: 2016-07-06 03:39:53


A few things come to mind;-
* Blocks take 3 times as long.
* There is 3 times less block space.
* Fee's do an almighty jump.
* The remaining miners receive 1/6th of the income they before (excluding the fee jump)
* The next difficulty adjustment is in six weeks!


Unlikely, but bitcoin would grind to a halt.


Not a lot, it would be very similar to what happened the last halving.  The price would have to change in order for it to be sustainable but that is sort of what happened last time.


All good questions that we don't really have answers for yet.  It is in the interests of miners to continue mining.  Without the mining there is not bitcoin, with no bitcoin they are out of business and what they have becomes worthless.
Yeah, unchartered waters.   I think most of what you are asking will happen to one degree or another until we will get to an equilibrium of sorts but I suck at making predictions. :P .

There are actually a few legitimate reasons that blocks can be small or even empty.  It would be hard to get consensus to penalise people for something that "just happens".
You may even get unexpected (and bad) results like miners holding back on transactions so they have something to include after they have solved a block.

I took it as such, you just made some interesting points that I didn't get into in the article (it was intended as a lite read for the less than technical).


Might be nostalgia on my part, I got one of the very first Butterfly Labs Jalapeno units and it clocked in at about 5.4 gh/s (Made 0.2428 BTC a day at the time LOL!) for all up consumption of 44 watts.
A the time I was mining with AMD 5870's at about 350 MH/s (stable) for about 200-250 Watts.
I could get a calculator out but I am fairly sure that is far more than a 2.5 x increase :P .

At the moment the article is just 'china = bad' without even trying to say why and would the consequences could be.  They can't alter the blockchain, they can't stop people transacting, where is the problem?
@_date: 2016-07-15 04:37:39


And what is your theory about that?  China mines all the bitcoin so it has it all?
A good 50% of bitcoin was mined even before China started mass mining in the first place and even then the ~25% in the past four years has probably only been half ish mined in China.
So, by that metric I would say most of the bitcoin was probably mined in the western world.  Does that make you feel any better?

Again, what are the implications of this that you are worried about?  It is not centralising it under a single authority, they can't alter the blockchain, they cannot block transactions.  What is the problem that you perceive?  So far you have said the equivalent of 'oooo centralisation'.
What is it you see as a threat?


Have a good read of the title.


And is it you agenda to make it seem that everything isn't?  Not all observations have an agenda.

You boggle my mind.
The blockchain is a part of bitcoin not the other way around (unless your talking about some altchain).
@_date: 2016-07-15 23:33:22


It really wouldn't, we hard fork the difficulty and that is it.  We would also probably put in place the SHA512 patch while we are at it in order to make sure they do nothing nasty but all of the code has already been audited and is well understood.
We could also (from previous experience) do it in hours instead of the days/weeks/months it would take to a government to put something like that in place.

You (being a core developer) are hardly my intended audience :P .
A week or so though I was talking to a friend that had a passing interest in bitcoin about it though and I was telling him it will be interesting to see how it works out because this is a big test for 'satoshi economics'.
He was under the impression that it would just sail by without an issue because he read the miners already had it 'priced in' so I started rattling off some of the nightmare scenarios (that I think unlikely) and accadetaly scared the bejeebus out of him.
It's going to be an interesting part of the bitcoin story I think (but I thought that the last time and was wrong).

To clarify, It will in no way effect your private/public keys in existence (or any to be made in the future) so your wallet (and balance contained therein) is safe no matter if you use the Bitcoin-QT client MultiBit, Electrum, BrainWallet or paper wallet.
Since you use MultiBit you can also safely ignore my suggestion to upgrade your client as well, I only mentioned that because of other changes coming up that probably wont effect you either ;P .

@_date: 2016-07-06 08:33:21
I don't intend to be FUD'ing ;) .
I just mean to give a bit of perspective.  Yes a lot of people have heavily subsidised power (our fallback position) and yes ASIC's are still improving but a lot of people don't actually get subsidised and are on thin ice at the moment, KNCMiner comes to mind.  I certainly don't expect the non-event that was last time.
While I very much doubt that we are going to see anything like a 50% drop to match the subsidy decrease I do think we are going to see changes in the mining industry as things shuffle around to create the new equilibrium.
I also know I could be totally wrong :P .

I tend to smooth out the weird spikes.
I don't know if we ever really found out what caused that particular jump (some speculate MtGOX) but I am fairly sure it had nothing to do with the halving (If you do I would be interested to learn what you think the relationship might be).
@_date: 2013-03-04 09:05:44
I know what you mean, it would be easy for me to feel heartbroken about the amount of bitcoin I used on pre orders, but when I look at how much the rest of my bitcoin has appreciated of late I am still in a net gain situation.... before I have received any miners.... crazy
@_date: 2013-03-23 06:27:38
True, but forks happen and they will happen again.  As a miner I am aware of this and I include this as part of the risk of the operation (I actually had shares in block 225430, the block that started it all at Slushes pool).
Anyway, the rules of bitcoin are open and available for anyone to audit if they so desire, and no one picked up on the problem so it is as much our fault for running the software as anyone else's.
@_date: 2013-03-19 02:22:15
I wrote an article explaining some of the implications;- 
@_date: 2016-07-15 21:55:06
I get what you are saying, yeah all countries have a central authority etc and that central authority may not like bitcoin so much or may want to do some other 'fancy economics' to their advantage.
However, bitcoin is/was built to be directly resistant to that kind of manipulation.  Since you don't want to name an actual threat that they might pose I will name a few that I imagine (sorry to put words into your mouth) and show you how pointless they are;-
* They ban bitcoin mining.
We hard fork the difficulty, problem solved.
* They march in with soldiers and take all the bitcoin equipment and perform a 51% attack.
We activate the SHA512 patch, problem solved.
* They alter bitcoin so the government has to sign blocks.
 
They just created an alt coin.

That would scare the bejesus out of me too, but in truth the Linux kernel is of a multitude of different versions compiled by thousands of different vendors and a million different geeks!
If it were all 1 linux kernel version (or compile) 1 vulnerability would have the potential to wipe out the internet.
@_date: 2013-01-31 01:50:10
I am not so sure it will, the same amount of bitcoins are still generated no matter what the network hash rate is.
The people who are running ASIC's will just receive more of the share.

I would just like to point out, the story is true!

@_date: 2013-03-17 07:31:00
It actually could, the 15th of May date is when the 0.8 series will drop that back comparability, if at that point a sufficient amount of miners have not upgraded a hard fork could be a possibility.
Remember, the rules to bitcoin are a consensus, and the consensus could be that people are too lazy to upgrade :P  (I very much doubt it though, miners and pool operators are very protective of the network, it is how we get paid)

False, if for example the US Government decided to ban bitcoin they could and its well within their rights to do so.

I am sure he had an opinion, and the line in the genesis block (The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks) almost certainly refers to it but bitcoin was 'created' long before the genesis block (it took time to write the software &amp; design the protocol).
My thoughts are that he added that line because on that particular day it seemed to fit instead of creating bitcoin and waiting for that line.
