As a retailer, I'd gladly pay a flat $30/mo for all transactions (BitPay) instead of 3% on transactions.

He may have (inadvertently) had a point - whenever the theoretical last Bitcoin is mined, the only incentive for people to continue using their computer's cycles/electricity will be the transaction fees for crunching the block chain. I would bet that when this time comes, a transaction sent with 0 fee attached will never get picked up. That being said, I don't think the fee of processing a transaction will ever equal that of 3% like the CC companies.

I live in Austin and there are now 3 Bitcoin ATMs. I've never used any of them. Why? In order to comply with anti-money laundering laws, they went with Robocoin machines ( which require measuring your pulse via your hand, a government issued id, and linking to your cellphone for 2 factor auth, all of which I'm not super excited about handing over.
If you think you'll use a separate machine that doesn't have these requirements, then you're setting yourself up to getting pounded by the feds for supporting money laundering. (IMO)
I think buying coins online through a reputable source (Coinbase, etc) is the way to go. The Bitcoin community needs to find a way to entice retailers to accept Bitcoin before we need more ATMs.

Looks like an economist from Goldman Sachs thinks Bitcoin could save $200 billion in fees.

I didn't know this. I would assume it's because a lot of Coinbase users are selling.

If Gox doesn't get bailed out (an investor), I highly doubt it. I think the chance of this is pretty slim.

It's a nice thought, but good luck with: "the remaining 740k (amount gox lost) would be distributed to those who could prove their Gox holdings - which could potentially **require Karpeles help**. "

I would argue that all the short term traders that would dump on this announcement have already bailed. I think the long term guys have had this event baked in their minds for a long time by now.

Make an online marketplace where you can trade cards for that game "Magic: The Gathering"

Can't believe I just realized this.

"no merchants offer discounts for cash" and "I've seen this offered at a few different gas stations" do not make sense in the same argument. Anecdotally, there are a TON of situations I've been in where I've received a discount for paying cash.
There's really no science to this type of research because it comes down to a personal choice, but this journalist wants to argue that "As rules change, more retailers offer discounts for cash payments" (
At the end of the day, I think this isn't a "widespread offer" because people don't want to deal with the hassle. Retailers charge a little bit more for their products to cover the % of CC transactions they DO have to pay for. Theoretically, as more transactions move off CCs, they'll be able to lower their prices a small amount. Or pay their workers more. Or hire that extra employee. It all goes somewhere.
What IS a widespread offer is "there is a 5$ minimum for buying anything here". Anecdotally, I see this more than I don't see this. Bitcoin undoubtedly solves this particular problem.

Some people really suck at presenting in front of a camera. Reading from a script makes them feel more comfortable. He knows thousands of people are going to view the video.

Retailers have to pay 2-3% to process CC transactions. Theoretically, a retailer can charge a customer who pays using BTC 2-3% less and still make the same amount of money. 
Additionally, the retailer doesn't have to deal with what are called "chargebacks". Good guy retailers who have a fair return policy often get scammed by people who play the system by issuing unwarranted chargebacks.

Are people able to use their ASIC miners for folding? A lot of people I've talked to expressed that they are saddened by the amount of energy / processing power that goes toward mining and the common argument is that the specialized hardware cannot be re-purposed. Maybe this isn't actually true?

I'm hoping this guy is trolling. If not, this is scary.

It was a pretty epic troll.... surprised he pulled it off. I don't believe that "Bitcoin is as bad as Jehovah's witnessess". Just like anything, people can get over excited and come across like this.

One of the best posts I've see in this subreddit in a long time. Thank you.

What app is that? The best I've found so far is  and what you're using looks interesting.
