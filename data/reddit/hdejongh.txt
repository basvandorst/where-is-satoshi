Hello Pine,
Can I draw your attention to an very old Christian non profit charity organization called Interserve?
I have send you an email as well with some more information. I hope I can get come votes up cause they are doing very good work in asia:
I hope you can make a large donation specifically the work they do in Cambodia.
btw what a good initiative!

Reduction of CNY Withdrawal Fee: From popular demand, and to benefit bitcoin sellers, we have reduced our CNY withdrawal fee from 1.0% down to 0.5%. We thank you for suggesting this.
does somebody know how much the fee is on huobi?

i think by creating a dump he made sure more ppl would deposite bitcoins to convert them to fiat.
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:57:12
i thought long and hard about it. But i think it has something todo with demand and supply or something.
could be wrong though
