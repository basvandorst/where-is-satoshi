Short answer - yes, but in the amount of time it would take to withdraw USD from mtgox, you may as well have just held it in BTC  (there is something crazy like a 6 month waiting period)  
Long Answer - This question has already been answered many times, just search through old posts

I just looked at this, and the opposite is true when you are selling. The CB price is ~$4 less than the gdax price. I see no reason to ever use CB unless you feel really uncomfortable with order books. You can still sell at market on gdax tho...

Nice sheet.
Here's a google sheet function to get the current price of any cryptocurrency so you don't have to keep updating it yourself.
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:34:11
There is a readme that explains how to use it.

If you really want to find out then try sending the address a small amount of bitcoin, and attach a note asking them what the fuck they think they're doing sending you free money without your goddamn permission!  
THOSE MOTHERFUCKERS!!!
EDIT: I'm wrong (no wonder no one ever responds to my notes)

This is gonna be interesting. I just put in a sell and the queue is crazy. If only I didn't lose everything else playing late night satoshidice.

You're quite welcome. I'm not a programmer, so this has been a fun project to work on while teaching myself about APIs and such.
in the code on line 26 between the price_cad and the } add:
 , "24hrchange" : data[0].percent_change_24h  
  
then you should be able to type in "24hrchange" in the currency parameter to get the 24hr percent change.
I'm at work right now so I don't have time to test that, but if that doesn't make sense or doesn't work than i'll dm you code that works.

As awesome as this is, it's [not real](
@_date: 2013-05-25 22:04:29
But when I go back in my transaction history on the blockchain, I can see my note that I sent. There is an example ion the [blockchain faq](  
Also it says when sending a note with a custom transaction using a blockchain wallet   
"This message will be permanently embedded in the blockchain. Anyone can read it"  
So while it's true you aren't sending them a note like a personal email, if they do happen to look at the transaction in the blockchain they can read the attached note.

Don't buy now, buy exactly 3 days, 29 minutes, and 7 seconds from...now  
Seriously though, just do your research and try to figure out if this "second bubble" is as fragile as the first, or if demand, interest, and overall recognition of bitcoin justifies the current price.  
just keep in mind that valuation of a virtual currency is not only completely different from other currencies and investments, but is virtually impossible.

I remember my first beer also. I was 6 and my grandpa gave me a sip. It tasted awful.
