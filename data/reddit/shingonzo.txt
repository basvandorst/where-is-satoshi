why wouldn't you just use a bank account for that? that seems like you're just adding an extra step. i understand that btc would be involved and seller would be receiving them, but if you still have a bank account involved in the process then i dont see the point?

the compulsory 2FA is unnecessary, its really the account holder's responsibility. this is kinda poor decisions compounding. i would never put that much money into an account that i know isnt verified and isnt protected with 2FA.
