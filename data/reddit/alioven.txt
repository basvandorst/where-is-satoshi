I'm not saying this will skyrocket BTC, just that it will be wanted in Greece and price there will be higher, but that doesn't mean it will raise globally. They can keep confidence in Euro for black market inside the country, but to get the funds outside Greece they will have to smuggle it or use BTC

Once capital control is enforced, they can't leave the country with cash in large quantities (or transfer it via bank wire). They can move it outside the country easily via Bitcoin.

All the submerged black economy money can be converted to BTC in the black market, and that will make BTC very valuable in Greece by itself. You are right about the financially visible money being harder to convert into BTC, but Greece is full of black money wanting to go outside at the moment

Sorry, but your argument is unrelated to what I said. "Worse" or "better" is a matter of point of view: for those that want or need to move their money freely, it is good. The fact that exists a submerged/black economy in Greece (or any country) has nothing to do with the existence of Bitcoin: those funds were lost for the official accounts well before Bitcoin was created, and those euros are already outside the control of the government.
What about people that want to transform their current funds into value storage like gold or (if they trust it) Bitcoin?

Capital flight are a consequence of the initial problems. Tax evasion and black markets are some of the causes. Bitcoin wouldn't enforce or impede it, and as a matter of fact I don't like the idea of Bitcoin raising on the disgrace of Greek, but for those that want to move funds, it is a valuable tool... and they could just buy-transfer-instantly sell, which would make a short-lived price increase, if any.
For me it is more interesting the value storage aspect of Bitcoin, just like gold or real estate in other situations.

I bought this 1 or 2 days ago and it was enabled back then. May be they disable it after reaching a certain number of sells or average price.

For a start, search your harddrive for a file called "wallet.dat" and the directory where it is located should hint the wallet software you used back then.

If it falls to 600 or 500, what impedes you waiting for a few days/weeks/months until it is back on the rise? You don't need to sell 1 btc because it is 100$ less valuable than the week before, right?

"Europe", the graphs are by currency, Euro for your case.
