Eurotrash or Eurosycophant?

If you say so, America just owns 90 percent of the intellectual property ever produced on the planet.  Of course that's the kind of things those in control like folks to argue over.  It makes it easy to manipulate the masses that way.

It's amazing this guys post got dowvoted so harshly.  I guess there's a large angry group of BunchofOtherCountriesekistanians that don't like plain facts.
@_date: 2014-01-04 16:01:48
If you don't see how that is insulting you're fucking blind.  It must be nice to be in a position to demand everyone behave as you like or else they're MURICANs.

Where is the site based?  Where is the single largest user base from?  If you don't like it, go make your own site.  We're not stupid enough to go there and complain that most non-specific references will by default represent that country.  The funny thing is, if this was a Chinese site, you'd never say this crap.  I'm sick of America having to apologize for itself.
I suggest you quit whining like a bitch.
@_date: 2014-01-05 15:17:54
Blind people just refuse to open their eyes to this new technology. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 16:34:28
No.  Go fuck yourself.  No one's going to change for you or your whiny countries demands.
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:14:03
I agree.  Everyone else should do that so Americans know it's not American news.  It's really helpful to the 46% of us Americans that represent this site.  Thanks
Everyone else can just assume it's news from America if there's no tag since we are the majority here.  See how that just saves time and digital resources?
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:16:41
STFU.  You know who you are and I know who you are.  You're some hell bent a-hole from Euroland where it's so damn fun to poke the bear and call it Murica.  
I repeat, Americans are NOT going to change for you.  Get over yourself.
@_date: 2014-01-04 16:32:25
You seem spoiled with your demands that Americans behave according to your norms.  
You also want to pretend that the the single largest group is not from America.
I'll give you some perspective.  I once watched a news segment where a Chinese television producer scoffed at the small audience American news channels have to cater to.  Guess what, he was right.  Chinese television is broadcast to FAR more people.
Get over yourself and your countries need to constantly denigrate America.  Do your professors teach that hatred or is it just something the citizens naturally do?
@_date: 2014-01-04 21:58:42
I know.  
@_date: 2014-01-04 15:51:24
Yeah, if you take a bunch of other countries and combine them,  they'd have more visitors here.
So, in all fairness, I say when it's not American business news, you say it's about BunchofOtherCountriesekistan.
@_date: 2014-01-04 15:49:17
News from everywhere is important.  Is it really a big deal to assume an American website will default to American culture?
@_date: 2014-01-04 16:42:13
I suggest you quit whining like a bitch.  I guess that's all they teach in Europe.
@_date: 2014-01-04 16:40:04
Clearly it does matter or you wouldn't be begging us to cater to you.  We'd have to beg you to include us.
@_date: 2014-01-04 15:36:26
Yeah...Uhh...that's bullshit.  No you don't.  It costs more than that to send to your next door neighbor with Western Union.

20,000 USD in btc is a drop in the bucket.  It would do nothing at all.
@_date: 2014-01-04 15:55:15
Guy is trying to make Americans behave as if we should have no pride.  He's trying to neuter us by calling us bad people for not saying we're American anytime something is mentioned without a nationality reference.
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:06:38
Eurosycophant then....gotcha.
@_date: 2014-01-06 20:38:26
I'd tell you to Google it but the irony of using Google(American company) on the Internet(started in America) to answer a question you posted on Reddit(American company) would be lost on you.
@_date: 2014-01-04 16:40:56
I don't give a shit.  I'm sick of this fucking attitude from Europeans.  Do they teach this shit in their schools?  They can go fuck themselves.
@_date: 2014-01-06 19:48:28
They already have.  I'm certain of that. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 15:58:26
You know what.  No.  If you don't like it, go elsewhere.  Is there a German Reddit?  That's about the only country in the EU with the balls to actually create a competitor.  Guess what, if they do create a nice site and I go there, I'll assume that default references are about that country.
@_date: 2014-01-04 16:44:25
How about...mmmm...no.  Trust me, most Americans feel the same damn way I do.  It's sickening how Europeans treat us.  Most Americans just don't say anything about it.
@_date: 2014-01-06 16:21:30
I've looked through YOUR post history.  It's obvious you are HEAVILY invested in LTC and altcoins.  
Your comments are a passive-aggressive attempt at souring bitcoin news.  I like the alts too, but you sir, are just a disingenous, dishonest person.
Sorry, but your comments don't matter.
@_date: 2014-01-04 15:52:15
Stop demanding Americans apologize.  We're getting sick of it.

Is Coinbase reporting anything to the IRS yet?
@_date: 2014-01-06 22:04:24
Mostly the citizens just counter punch now.  It's just we get punched at a lot on the Internet.
@_date: 2014-01-06 19:58:43
These guys employ the smartest people on the planet, you best believe they've hedged their bets a long, long time ago.

If this means I can walk in and buy bitcoin, this needs to be upvoted like hell guys.  There are locations all around me and everyone.  I can see a lot of Mexcians using this to send money home. 
We need to get the word out.
@_date: 2013-12-29 04:26:04
Wow...folks responding here are idiots.  Yes the world will be a lot better off.  The elite will not be able to print money at will (destroying the value of your money) and give it to their friends.  Also, when someone rich can't add value to the world, they will lose their bitcoins over time.
