Were there any known reasons why the price dropped like this? I only got into this around August when China banned exchanges.

The guy acts like a grown ass man-child all the time. The middle finger rage and personal attacks on the guy who interviewed him, and the leeching off the bitcoin name fo example. He is off his rocker.
On topic though, I am happy for Andreas. Such a humble, knowledgable speaker. I hope this does him and his family well.

Im with this guy. When the price increases by so much, so fast, its gotta be due a correction soon.. a part of me says its a bubble that will pop soon, however if its a slow, gradual increase, it feels a lot more natural and thats how it should be. I feel a correction soon, but i dont know wether it will be massive scale or not.

Not per annum, but I believe it's 4 years? Someone may be able to correct me on that.
I have a feeling I'm getting two different subjects mixed up here, but there is a "halvening" where the amount of BTC miners get for mining gets halved from 12.5BTC to what I assume will be 6.25. This will happen in 2020. You can check out a website here:
But in terms of difficulty, I believe the difficulty is always changing?
I read somoene's post that said if everyone in the world stopped mining, one person could probably do it from their phone, as the difficulty would shift. ATM however, there are a few large mining pools (to my knowledge) around the globe with a lot of mining power than a phone, so the difficulty is high.
If any of what I have said is completely wrong, please correct me. I have learned everything from following and reading various sub-reddits and communities.

Question - Is it now 'officially' called Bitcoin Core or is this name still just being used by the brainwashed cronies from Roger Vers camp of Shitcoin Cash?
To my knowledge it was never called or referred to as Core until this fuckstick tried stealing the name to downplay actual Bitcoin, however I have seen it in some places as core..

My android app was updated to 3.0 this week. How would i go about transferring my funds from Mycelium to Electrum? Do I have to pay a miner fee to send to the new wallet? Something about different type of encryptions for the seeds tells me it wouldnt be as simple as inputting the Mycelium seed into Electrum?

Its 'The Sun'. Why would you think this is a credible article/site?

Socks... And sandals?

I see. Should i create a new wallet in electrum and send the funds with a miner fee to the new address then? Would that be the quickest/easiest?

Thanks for the helpful post. Not seeing he option for bip39 on the android app, and it seems they are talking about the PC version on there, but its a step in the right direction and i will look deeper. Thanks man.

Is Samouri better than mycelium? Sorry, I am new to this, and moved my coins from coinbase to mycelium a few weeks ago. Which one of them is best for when the fork happens, and would it be advised to send them to a new wallet right urgently?
