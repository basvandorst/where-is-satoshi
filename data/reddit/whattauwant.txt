While we’re on this topic, do taxes need to be paid every year? For instance if a person buys bitcoin in 2015 and holds and doesn’t sell until 2020... do they pay taxes on the gains every year? Or do they just pay a lump sum 20% long term capital gains tax on the total profit in 2020? 
Basically can it keep compounding tax free from year to year as long as you hold?

Ohh gotcha.. maybe this is something that was more common before it became fairly simple to purchase bitcoin?

What did this guy do exactly? Can individuals get in trouble (if they don’t register as a money service business) for buying bitcoin on coinbase, holding, selling coin, and transferring back to their bank? Sorry I’m a bit confused.

They have no max until you want to create tax forms. You can upload .csv files without paying but API uploads require a fee. From what I can tell, both forms of importing to the trick.

I used both and prefer cointracking.info. It’s way easier to edit things (transfers in/out vs actual deposits/withdrawals etc). Seems a lot more user friendly in general and easier to navigate. It’ll even give you a total amount of how much of each coin (coin balance) you should own today at the end. This is sorta a good way to validate whether or not you imported everything accurately.
Also bitcoin.tax completely jacked their rates right after they found out that coinbase distributed a shitload of 1099k’s. For high volume people they jacked their rates by like 5-10x.

It’s not illegal to gamble on the internet. In fact the only people who can get in trouble are those offering internet gambling or banks processing payments to and from the sites.
Your friend won’t get in trouble. The only people that could is the site owner or the exchange he was cashing the bitcoin into.
(Just did some research. 2 people were charged with placing bets online in the past 15 years. Both were misdemeanor charges). 
Regardless of how much he converts to fiat, he owes money on gambling gains no matter what for 2017.
Let’s say he won $70,000 and the price of btc was $1000 at the time he converted the USD to btc giving him 70 btc.
The trade is this:
Buy 70 btc
Sell $70,000
If he woulda sold when the price of btc was $19,000 in 2017. He would owe taxes on $1.26 million for btc gains and $70,000 of gambling gains.
