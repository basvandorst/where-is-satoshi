Try out Bitfinex
@_date: 2014-08-18 23:58:02
One thing I would like to mention...you guys do know that you don't have to take a leveraged position even when trading on an exchange that offers it, right? If you are not leveraged, there is no possible way for you to have your position be liquidated. So I, personally, find the idea that margin causes instability to be laughable. 
Those who want to use margin can, and they should realize that it is riskier than a simple position of holding the asset. Those who don't want to use margin shouldn't, and aren't forced to, and they don't have to worry about flash crashes, etc., although they also won't make as much if the market moves in their direction. 
Basically, you take on risk by trading margin in the hopes of a larger reward.

Really great analogy...

Hi everyone,
Josh from Bitfinex here, I wanted to respond to this and let everyone know what is going on. 
The problem stems from Incapsula's (anti-DDOS service) caching of dynamic pages, which it shouldn't be doing.  This appears to be happening intermittently for a few hours and not in all geographic areas.  We have turned off caching while we wait for a response from Incapsula.  While this issue may have leaked some info regarding other users, no identifying information was leaked aside from username and, at no time was there a security threat that would potentially allow anyone to interact with someone else's account.
This was related to the display of content, not in any way related to the authentication needed to log in, or place orders. 
We are very sorry for the problem, and have put a fix in place. As I have said before, we are working constantly behind the scenes to finish some upgrades.
So, I am here, and I wanted to see if people had any other questions I could answer?
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:39:41
Josh from Bitfinex here, that is exactly right. For large volume traders who are adding liquidity to our books, you can trade for free. We have quite a bit more volume, and we also offer one of the most advanced platforms in the entire space. We have advanced order types as well as margin trading, and a proven track record regarding security. 
Please check it out and let me know your thoughts.
@_date: 2014-08-18 23:55:18
It is really funny that you mention that. We do have such systems in place, and they avoided the severity of this crash. I have a very long AMA trying to explain why such systems are necessary and I get accused of market manipulation. So, apparently you can't win. 
We, at Bitfinex, basically have tried to adopt the smartest parts of financial markets. Nasdaq not only has circuit breakers but they have a more targeted Limit Up Limit Down algorithm in place that restricts individual assets into a trading band. What we have done is tried to be even more targeted, with the goal of providing a stable, fair exchange, while interfering as little as possible. Our system tries to flag potentially manipulative orders on an individual basis. I explain more in my AMA
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:46:21
At Bitfinex, we have lowered our fees, rather than increasing them. We offer "maker/taker" fee structure, meaning that if you are leaving your orders on our book, you will pay less than someone who is removing orders from our book. In fact, if you are a large volume trader(25,000 coins per month)  adding liquidity you pay 0 in fees. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 23:36:51
I am! That will solve all of our problems, I live with Justin and Gabe, btw
@_date: 2014-08-19 00:05:01
The problem with kill switches is that usually they spook the market, resulting in many people pulling their orders, resulting in a thinner book once it opens. Thatis why for example, Nasdaq implemented the Limit Up Limit Down system which is less intrusive overall then the kill switch. Both have their uses, and I think that in general, an exchange should always try to interfere as little as possible while maintaining a stable, fair market
@_date: 2014-08-07 16:51:56
Not sure exactly what you mean? The FRR is right now around 0.113% on USD, 0.0055% on BTC. 
Also, after looking at this thread, we are looking into a more achievable tiering structure for fee breaks. I will let you know more as soon as we make a decision.
@_date: 2014-08-19 00:02:29
I don't really think that margin is new...Bitfinex is two years old. We implement a system similar to Nasdaq's Limit Up Limit Down, and that is the reason why we did not have such a dramatic swing. In general, it is very possible for people to mortgage their house, and use that money to buy bitcoins, meaning they are now in a leveraged position (There were a few posts about this back in the old days). 
I agree with you can choose to do whatever suits you as an investor. If you don't need margin, you have to obligation to use it, and these sort of events wouldn't affect your position. If you are bullish on bitcoin in the long run, an opportunity to buy coins for less than what you think they are worth today is nothing but a good thing for you. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 16:54:50
As mentioned, anyone can trade with leverage. We require full AML/KYC documentation for anyone touching the legacy financial system (if you are withdrawing or depositing dollars). For people only involved in the crypto space, we currently allow transactions on the blockchain without having to go through all of those requirements.
This is, personally, the model I think that makes the most sense. I know some people complained about the paperwork in a post above, but it is only fair, when using the legacy system, to play by its rules. After all, bitcoin does provide a more efficient system.

At Bitfinex, we have the second largest volume in the BTC/USD trade. On top of that, we offer multiple advanced order types, such as stop orders, trailing stop orders, hidden orders, OCO (one closes other) orders and Fill or Kill orders. 
We also offer margin, as well as the ability to lend your bitcoins or dollar to enable others to trade on margin.
We have one of the fairest fee structures in the area, employing the "maker/taker" model, which means that if you leave orders on our book, you will pay less than someone who is removing orders from our book. With large enough volume, "makers" pay nothing. 
We offer a very comprehensive API, allowing you to manage all aspects of your account programatically.
If anyone wants more information, or needs any help with onboarding, please either message me, or email support

Hi guys, we had a problem with an update, but we are all working very hard to fix it. Really sorry for the inconvenience. Zane will update with any new information. 
@_date: 2015-09-08 17:12:44
I have been investigating this...do you have any time to go over some questions?
@_date: 2015-09-08 17:20:18
from what I can see, it appears that they were moved out of mt gox in 2013, and as pointed out by others, probably 80% of the coins traded on Gox during that time. So, most old coins probably can be associated with a Gox address. 
From our perspective, this doesn't appear to be a problem, unless it was moved much more recently (or if there was a clear address which received the 'hacked' funds)
Basically, what we can see with this information is that coins which used to be at Gox are now at Bitfinex (which is also the case for most other coins from that time period).
I think OP noticed this specific transaction because it was old coins that had not been moved in a while resulting in a large spike in "Bitcoin Days Destroyed", but there hasn't been anything so far to suggest that these coins were part of the hack. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:51:26
Yeah...around 10 months (done in head, even at 5 still bad) to break even not counting electricity? With 600 avalons on the way?

@_date: 2013-05-06 09:00:30
In some ways, I hope we have that problem. It means bitcoin is growing! I'm not 1000% sure how it will all work out, some people have been throwing around a figure of $1000 per day transactions before you start hitting regulatory requirements. I don't know. The beauty of this is that you can start another one in another park, they don't have to grow into 1,000 people mosh pits. 
One key point is that ideally, I will get this web app up and running (github link, could use help), which means that you will be able to hopefully see where these are located, and their order books...I figure the free market will work all this out, I am just here to try stuff, if it's valuable, it'll happen, if not, then why bother doing it?

@_date: 2013-05-06 12:19:23
sorry! I am hoping this will become a regular thing (at first, every monday, but ideally monday through friday for a few hours)
We basically talked about it on thursday at the meetup group, and agreed to do this today at 4pm. They wanted to do this last week, so I slowed them down as much as possible...and also, we'll be there till 8 i think, so maybe you can make it?
@_date: 2013-05-06 10:29:22

@_date: 2013-05-06 10:11:57
Yeah, lol, I agree. I guess we want to sift through history and take the good parts, while leaving the bad. 
I also think that this is in some ways paying an homage to the start of the greatest exchange in the world, the New York Stock Exchange, but also showing in some ways that the NYSE probably couldn't start in today's world, the regulation would kill them.

@_date: 2013-07-28 04:26:39
thats the dream...think of it like a farmers market, every town can have one...would make things so much easier for so many people.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:31:17
Yeah, the level of incompetence in understanding the basic motivations of incentives is mind blowing. 
Guys, if you make trading free, people do MORE. They can afford to do it on smaller amounts, and more frequently. If you have too much order flow, I'm guessing the solution is not more order flow...
There are basically unlimited ways to change incentives. Order fees that are higher the smaller the order. Limits on number of orders per second. Limits on time order has to be on book (no cancels for 30 seconds), 
In case they weren't aware, there is a small little group called NASDAQ and NYSE, they have been around a little while, and seem to be able to process more than one order a second, maybe look at how they do it?

Hi all, this is Josh Rossi. I "founded" the first Satoshi Square meetup group, and wanted to say that if anyone has any questions, I am available to answer them.
To those who said they would like to attend, congrats, you are now, and always have been, invited. It is open to anyone who would like to attend. We meet on Mondays from 5-7pm (usually in Union Square Park, but depending on weather and other factors, sometimes at EVR on 39th street).
In order to figure out where we are, I suggest: 
1. following  on twitter
2. Join the Satoshi Square Facebook Group
3. Just watch r/bitcoin on mondays, I always post here
In case you are curious, here is the very FIRST post about Satoshi Square

so awesome guys, can't wait to visit!
@_date: 2013-07-28 04:16:50
Well, I would say that the one thing you need to remember is "have fun".
As long as you guys are having fun, others will join in. It'll also be easier to keep doing it on a consistent basis. That is the key, people will start showing up if they KNOW you will be there. So get a track record going, and keep showing up. It may be slow, but if you can chat about bitcoins with some cool people, why not? It is in part a public service. People may have questions, be ready to answer them. Stay safe, pick a good spot. I am rambling, but feel free to get in touch with me, and we can discuss further
@_date: 2013-05-20 14:56:17
I have been promoting this idea at the conference, and the interest has been MASSIVE. There were a few amazing companies that are very interested in linking up with local systems like this, either through API access or through offering their service to make moving bitcoins, or other features available. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 14:02:46
it is entirely p2p, and as far as i know as long as no one goes over $1000, it is not pertinent to FinCEN or any other agency. Localbitcoin.com has operated in literally 100's of cities (i believe) with so far 0 arrests. 
Let's say I wanted to trade baseball cards or Magic the Gathering cards...a group of people can't get together to trade them? Buy and sell them off each other. Do we really live in that much of a police state? I seriously doubt it. 
You think that the press would be on the cops side? For busting a bunch of people in a park doing nothing? I completely disagree. Last I checked craigslist was not reporting 1099's on all their transactions, it's P2P (in case you missed that part, there is NO central authority or organization, only voluntary individual participation between 2 parties)

what you fail to see, and this IS possible, is the faith of btc users...
Most people see price crash as time to buy. I don't think I have to remind you they crashed from a previous all time high to pennies...and then crawled back...if the fed wants to show how little they care about maintaining the value of the dollar, most people may not even want to sell...volume goes down, price goes up. Also, you may be able to pull this once, after that, people will just take advantage of your buy high sell low strategy. It is the EXACT same thing they TRY to do with gold, they naked short gold, in hopes that they can make it seem unattractive...but you are fighting the market, and by doing so, you are actually making gold more valuable while trying to make it seem less...not sustainable, and then it snaps back like a rubber band, and you lost a ton of money for nothing...
The point of our idiotic monetary policy is to try to stand in a river and hold it back with our hands. You can fight the free market for a little while, but it always wins in the long run. At the end of the day, that is what we have been trying to do with QE, and overrun printing presses.
While they may scare weak hands out of their money, they will do more to show how scared THEY are, because their matrix-like illusion is crumbling. It's similar to how if the govt were ever to try and ban it, it would amount to an endorsement to the effect of "it works too well, please stop using it". 
Lastly, it is a global currency, would they find european and japanese banks to coordinate with them? As of yet, they can't control the BoJ from doubling their QE. These are opening salvos in a currency war, and the demise of the dollar as a reserve currency. China is buying BTC in large amounts, as is Russia...I don't think they have the political will to get both of them on board with any such program.
tl;dr please do it, i'd love to pick up more coins for cheap.
@_date: 2013-07-28 04:27:42
hmmm, sorry the times don't work out for you, but for most people, we get off work at 5. We like to do things during daylight hours, hence 7pm we are done. Also, if you have a gox account, that's great, but many don't...and they can't wire money in 13 hours, they are looking at weeks of waiting
@_date: 2013-05-06 05:08:35
Basically, it is what the title says it is. I figured that one problem with getting bitcoin or selling bitcoin is the difficulty of the exchanges. Electronic exchanges are a relatively new development. For most of human history, exchanges were face to face agoras.
Localbitcoins.com has been doing a lot of business, but this provides a few benefits over that.  
1. You already know when and where (no more scheduling)  
2. Groups CAN be self-policing (safety in numbers)  
3. All trades are done p2p with no fees to an exchange.  
I think the benefits over an electronic exchange are obvious, but I'll list a few:  
1. No waiting for cash to get into exchange  
2. No waiting for account verification  
3. Distributed, no central point of failure  
4. Cash immediately in hand  
5. Can't be closed by banks  
6. Lag is basically non-existent, as are bots.  
So, I plan on building a realtime order book webapp to help with some aspects. Check out the github below. For my philosophy behind this fleshed out in greater detail check out my blog (btcshares). A lot of the first participants are active in either the facebook group or the meetup group or both.

look...if you have ever been on  on IRC, coinbase is probably not necessary for you. It serves an important role, but it is not really for the l33t haxor's of the bitcoin world IMO. 
When I want to show someone bitcoin, or give them one, it is perfect. They understand, and it gets them comfortable. Their vendor integration is huge in causing more adoption. 
That being said, no limit orders, takes forever, and they are obviously overwhelmed. Take it for what it is, I personally use BitFloor, since I like to trade, I appreciate liquidity rebates, and API's, etc.

Deflation is bad when a currency is used as a unit of account. Bitcoin need not be used as such yet. If people "hoard" their money (we called it saving when I was a kid), that is a good thing. I guarantee you, people won't starve while spooning a gold bar...they will spend, or what's the point of having wealth. I've found that people on SR charge WAY more than going rates, probably due to premium stuff and notoriety, as well as not updating prices quickly.

@_date: 2013-04-20 08:58:32
It can at most go up 4x per readjustment, so in 30 days (really 4032 blocks) it can go up 16x...
To give all an estimate, though, the difficulty hasn't doubled in a long time, someone would have to bring ~55 TH/s online to double it, 165 TH to quadruple it. 
In other words, expect difficulty to rise, but mining will still make sense for many people. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 08:46:00
Well, you will be showing up to a group of people who will be seeing your face. You don't have to provide any personal information. Though until the app is up, you will have to talk to people a little bit to figure out the prices and such. 
No one who does not wish to appear on camera will be put on camera. I will make sure to make everyone aware who is holding the camera, and warn them if they do not wish to be on camera, at least the ones under my control...you are in a park after all. 
Not really sure why that would make a difference, but assuming it does, we will be sensitive to that. 
But to clarify, I do not expect to have $10,000 transacted later today. In fact, it will most likely be pretty boring. Most of the people showing up already have bitcoins and want to hold them. Maybe a few sales here and there, but hopefully, it will grow slowly. The point is to make others aware that if THEY want to buy or sell, they now can.
@_date: 2013-05-06 07:17:04

@_date: 2013-05-06 04:55:28
yeah that is the problem, thanks for explaining it so well. Debt is NOT fungible. This is how they basically "hand-wave" the functionality. I can tell you that that homeless guy over there owes me $5 and I owe you $5, so now that homeless guy owes you $5, see you later. You'd be ok with that? 
The other problem besides the fungibility problem, is the resilience problem. We witnessed what debt based systems cause during 2008. I owe you money, other people owe me money, its a chain, and it's only as strong as its weakest link. All of a sudden, I can't pay my mortgage because THAT guy couldn't pay his rent...we all lose. With wealth based systems, I know what I have, I know what I can risk, but...I rely on myself. I think debt is necessary, but debt backed by debt is usually a recipe for disaster.
edit: by the way, the transferring of responsibility from one party to another party is called "novation" and typically it is done from a counterparty to a trusted third party exactly for that reason. The point is to AVOID me having to trust someone else to come through.

LOL, Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, buy gold. How do people's brains let them say such obviously silly things?
Gold's "intrinsic" value, is a tiny percentage of what it trades for. So what "backs" its price? Nothing, just the laws of supply and demand (which is also what gives it its "intrinsic" value).
Anything's value is simply a function of its utility and its scarcity, which is just another way of saying supply and demand. If its useful, there is demand, if its rare, thats a small supply. So what is gold useful for? Storing value! Inthe same way that lumber is useful for building houses, gold is useful for storing value, in fact, it has the best properties of pretty much any physical element to do that. It's rare, hard to counterfeit, divisible, and all of it is identical. It also lasts an extremely long time. What other substance can claim those properties?
There was nothing as good as gold, until bitcoin was invented. It shares most of those fundamental attributes with gold, but it does MORE! It can move frictionlessly throughout the world at the speed of light! It retains the ability to be divisible, durable, fungible, and verifiable, and is guaranteed to be scarce, we know exactly how many there will be!
So if gold is valuable because its useful and scarce, bitcoin will be valuable for the same reasons, as long as it is useful. 
So is bitcoin useful? Look at google wallet, venmo, braintree, western union, moneygram, visa, MasterCard, SWIFT, SEPA, Fedwire, American Express, etc. 
They are all trying to move money around, but it can be argued that bitcoin offers a more efficient solution. If thats the case, then its usefulness is proven. 
Useful + Scarce = Valuable

Dude, computers are good at math. You simply peg your fee in dollars to the 24 hour average bitcoin price. They already have payment services which would automatically adjust the amount of BTC required and handle converting back to cash. As a company, it is relatively simple to accept them without touching them. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 10:21:45
By the way, this is an interesting project from a bitcoin perspective, BUT if anyone wants to look at the technological perspective of this, I highly recommend you check out the github link. 
It is (I think) a really cool design implementation. Basically, real-time all the way through, should be very fast. And it is interesting in that there is one language throughout the whole thing. 
Brief example of design: 
angular.js ---socket.io---&gt;node.js (mongodb)

Localbitcoin.com did not merit your attention? This is the point of what we are doing today. To give people a time and place to meet others, not having to trawl through craiglist and worry about the when and where or whether people actually have coins. You are obviously entitled to your opinion. Just look at gox's volume. The number of bitcoin transactions is GROWING, not shrinking. Biggest thing slowing it is lack of access.
I guarantee you, there will be people selling today in Union Square, and I will be one of them.  
@_date: 2013-03-24 18:51:20
yeah...you look for head and shoulders...i read the intestines of a bull...same diff really, the problem with chart patterns is that you see them after they have happened, you can retrofit the theory to explain what the market did, but predicting it while its happening is pretty tough.
usually, you do worse than random chance. point is, you need information that is actionable, you buy apple because you have some info that they are releasing an apple car or something for a short term gain, or they beat earnings and it isn't priced in yet, or you guess.
short term, it's just gambling really...that's why the long term investor usually wins...in the short term, the broker or exchange wins from your fees

Ok, I will sum up why I think (not know) that ripple is stupid. 
1. It solves a non-existent problem, I've never had to wait for 6 confs. Go to EVR, you won't wait there. I estimate that over 75% of all transactions ever are basically 0-1 confirmation. 
2. It is NOT open-source, they say it will be, fine, when it is, then it's open source. 
3. It is centralized, opencoin seems like they wish they thought of bit coin so they could have monetized it better than satoshi. I don't like trusting any central bank/company
4. Debt-based: You say "only lend to people you trust", how many banks lent to people they said "never going to pay me back", THAT is what defaulting is. Not living up to expectations. With debt based systems, people failing hurts others. 
5. Their marketing, "we're your friend!" "It's not a currency", your business plan is to profit off XRP increase in value (stated, but also why else hold 30%?), so you treat it as a currency in direct competition with BTC. 
6. Compliance: how many bit coin exchanges shutdown or hacked? Trusted gateways magically solve those problems? Bitcoin exchange can't become compliant but ripple trusted gateway can...how? Exchange can just do what you plan on doing, save us a step. 
So, I see many problems, no answers and very little value in the first place. If you say "it will be like this in the future", ill wait till you prove it. I don't see any reason for it.

I've heard it said that Ripple is able to coexist with bitcoin, because it will help with transactions. That is the point of bitcoin. The barrier in bitcoin is not transferring money, it's moving fiat into the system. Ripple doesn't solve this, how will the get licenses for each "trusted gateway" to comply with FinCEN? They haven't actually solved the problem they set out to solve and duplicate bitcoins usefulness. No one actually uses them for their intended purpose. It's like let me create Dwolla, using bitcoin like tech, and then keep it centralized, and add back trust into central controllers. 
Tl;dr ripple is not a solution to any of bitcoins problem and is a waste of time

"These charges include hefty fines and possibly jailtime for anyone who buys or sells bitcoin in cash on US soil. You'd think this would be absurd, but its exactly what happened to Douglas Jackson, founder of E-Gold."
If i remember correctly, E-Gold was a company, offering goods, across state lines. This, is 2 people, doing a PRIVATE transaction. To be honest, I think the law is on our side in this respect. Typically two parties can engage in any contract as long as it  
A) doesn't break the law (I know of no law saying that people can't buy and sell bitcoins) 
B) both people are free of coercion and are of sound mind  
Besides that, contract law usually supersedes any other law. Now, as far as taxes are concerned. I do not think they expect people to file immediately when the transaction takes place, so you would have a rough time busting someone for tax evasion in person...

How do I do that? It was written about (kinda) in the NY Observer.
 
Mr. Shrem had established his corner booth as a place for fellow bitcoiners to congregate. There was Josh Rossi, who’s working on organizing an open-air bitcoin exchange in Union Square; Yifu Guo, who helped create the first custom-built bitcoin miner; and Jonathan Mohan, who organizes a weekly bitcoin meetup in NYC.

So, sorry that it has taken me so long to do a proper recap, I was exhausted yesterday!
I would say that this was a complete success. We had a bunch of people who traded, had fun hanging out in a park on a beautiful day, AND we got some great press out of this.
Nathaniel Popper from The New York Times, as well as Stephen Foley from the Financial Times came by to do some interviews and report on our little exchange. This was just amazing!
We also had J. Porter deVries, who some of you may know from the meetup group, stop by. He is a lawyer, and is moving into law as it relates to cryptocurrencies. He also assured me that we were not doing anything wrong, and that we were on firm legal footing.
I can't list everyone who was there, but we had a lot of really awesome bitcoiners stop by. We were active from 4pm till around 7pm. 
I will give you a quick recap. I showed up at 4pm, kinda looking around, seeing if anyone was there. It was one of those "Night at the Roxbury" situations, where I was like "are you here for...", and eventually a couple of people introduced themselves. We started chatting. 
Jerry showed up, and I have to say he was amazing. He really took charge of the trading pit, and kept track of transactions, as well as best bid and ask. I was so busy chatting, answering questions, and introducing people that I couldn't have done this nearly as well as he did.
So, we were by far the LEAST sketchy people in Union Square, and everything went smoothly. I think that it was a successful first run. Only a few thousand dollars were transacted, but I think as people become aware of it, they will stop by in greater numbers if they need liquidity.
Feel free to ask me any questions.

the way you introduce fear is by making the price drop, correct? to a LOT of bitcoin users (people who survived the last crash) you are just giving away porsche's for pennies. This is happening, and they can buy high sell low forever, i'll be there to keep selling high buying low.
@_date: 2013-05-06 13:13:52
Agree! I've never thought we'd get 100% adoption. I'm a fan of competing currencies, and I don't think that cash is going anywhere. Each have their use, and I feel that however people choose to use it, the free market will decide. 
Same with ideas, I believe I stated somewhere below, if this idea is valuable, it'll succeed with or without me. If it isn't valuable, then why would I care that it fails?
As long as we allow the free market to work, we end up with the best possible situation.

saw one guy buy $10,000 worth of bitcoins. He didn't plan it in advance, just showed up. We were able to accommodate him.
@_date: 2013-02-13 19:27:41
Ok, I will try to explain this....
Let's use simple examples and small numbers, so as not to confuse.
I buy 1 share of S.DICE for the cost of 1 BTC. At that time, the exchange rate is 1:1 vs USD. 
Now, as I hold my one share someone bids 1.2 BTC for a share of S.DICE
I can now sell my share for 20% more than I bought it for. In other words, I have now gained .2 BTC as the return on my original investment, or 20%.
At the SAME TIME, the current exchange rate of BTC to USD has also changed, now every bitcoin is worth $2. My 1.2 bitcoins are now worth...$2.40, remember, I originally bought ONE share for ONE Bitcoin which Cost me ONE DOLLAR.
So, I now have $2.40 instead of $1.00, in other words, my share of S.DICE appreciated by 20%, Bitcoins appreciated by 100%...my POSITION increased by 240%, or I multiply the effect of the exchange rate by my return on my investment.
Is this too complicated for you? Anyone who deals with international finance understands what they call FX RISK, the risk that the currencies value will change over the course of your position.
This is not to say that this scenario will also play out as I mentioned. Either variable can swing in either direction, but the end result WHEN MEASURED IN US DOLLARS, will always be a function of the change in your positions value times the change in the underlying value. 
There MAY be some correlation between S.DICE's revenues and the current exchange rate, but that is neither guaranteed nor certain. Even if it was, that does not change the fact that my value when measured in dollars is a function of the change in my positions value multiplied by the change in the underlying's value. 
Edit: there are no "shares" in bitcoins, you just hold bitcoins. I can't hold "shares" in japanese yen, I just hold yen, but if the stocks I want to buy are traded on the Nikei, I have to first convert my USD to yen, then i can purchase equity in whatever company. To get out of my position, I have to reverse that process.
Tl:DR If you have a position denominated in a foreign currency, you incur FX Risk, the risk that the value of the currency that the asset you are buying is denominated in will change. In this case, that is boosting returns.
@_date: 2013-07-28 04:28:40

Out of curiosity, what do you get paid in? Do you immediately convert? Genuinely curious.
Point is, you need to hold some currency. Spending immediately upon receiving is not the best policy IMHO. Find a good store of value, and hold it for a rainy day. 
I appreciate bitcoin because it gives people the opportunity to not be made fools of for saving money. It doesn't incentivize rampant debt. It encourages fiscal responsibility from a personal level upwards.

How would that matter? My shares are in BTC, dividends paid in BTC. Sdice does most of the transactions during the day. I don't think the underlying will affect the per share price, at least not anytime soon.

@_date: 2013-02-14 18:38:25
Cool story, bro...too bad it doesn't work the same in real life as it does in a text book.
The reason for that IS the inefficiency of the market...and this thing called time. No one knew where the price was going to be at the beginning of the month, when I got my shares. And his revenues are still his revenues. I still get dividends on what he made when the price was cheaper.
Also, are you telling me that when the dollar gets stronger EVERY company that is traded in dollars goes up? I've never seen a day on the street where EVERY stock did anything. I think most people value companies based on their earnings, and their management and what new information has come out about them.
Let's say that (for example) tomorrow on the news they run a story on satoshi dice, and his user base doubles, but bitcoin drops...oh, the price per share is definitely going down? 
Obviously you don't understand the intricacies of markets, but the SHARE PRICE is a function of the supply and demand for THAT SHARE, the bitcoin price is a function of the supply and demand for that bitcoin. The COMBINATION of the two is your final return.
I can give you a million of examples, they are called forward contracts...people use them to guarantee the VALUE of the cash they have in their receivables, as they don't want to undertake FX risk. Maybe I should post some wikipedia articles so you can read up.
You should pay attention to the part about SPOT PRICE vs FORWARD PRICE.
Now, all that being said, are the two related in any way, is there any correlation? Sure, I never said there wasn't...and in fact, if the price keeps rising, the average bet size may become SMALLER, meaning less revenues, meaning less dividends...but those sort of effects play out over a way longer time than my trades will take. No one even knows how much his revenue will be for February yet, but to say that AAPL or GOOG or BAC or SPY goes up and down every day SOLELY because of currency prices is ridiculous. 
TL;DR Read up on forward contracts and FX Risk

Not exactly...most physical coins are simply receptacles for a private key, if I gave you a piece of paper folded up with my account number and PIN, would that be a debt instrument?
I see where you are coming from, and you could look at it that way, in that technically I could have copied the key, but I think it's more analogous to giving someone access to an account that holds funds (that is really what bitcoins are, a debit in an asset account recorded on a public ledger). 
Perhaps nitpicky, but i am sensitive to the words "debt instrument" and "bitcoin" in the same sentence.

There are different fees. Bit instant I believe will give you a lower amount of dollars. So say you want $200, they will give you $192 in bitcoin. Then I think money gram or someone else marks it up 3.95. 
I paid 203.95 for around 192.50 in bitcoins, BUT, it is the fastest, guaranteed way to get bitcoins to yourself in an hour or so. So if its urgent, or a large amount, maybe worth it. 
If you have time to wait, I'd suggest going local. Less fees, clearing just as quick, but takes longer to find someone willing to trade. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:42:54
Like the last major crash that killed bitcoin...it's an idea, and a good one at that. You can't kill an idea. I'm telling you, we laugh during these panic sells...
Maybe to people unfamiliar with this market it's scary or w/e, but I literally told people last night "wake me if we need to move the decimal left or right a spot..." That is the scale with which you watch bitcoin...or you prove to be a weak hand and your coins go to someone who deserves them more...the point is that none of that matters, bitcoin is in the wild, let whoever wants to buy and whoever wants to sell, do as they wish and the market sorts it out. This is freedom, maybe some can't handle it, but this is it.

Have you heard of satoshi dice? That is less than 20 seconds...half of all transactions in the blockchain. In fact, I've never had to wait...ripple solves a non-existent problem, 6 confirmations is an arbitrary number, and in practice, I've never had to wait. Not at EVR, not when selling to mycelium at the conference, not trading in union square. Can we actually look at the weaknesses ripple aims to solve?

I love local biitcoins, but to be honest, it usually feels kinda sketchy doing meeting up, it's that last mile functionality that project buttonwood deals with (as well as the when and where), we get a lot of people buying their bitcoins for the first time because they feel comfortable and see familiar faces. It can be as easy as a weekly meetup group, or in a park for a hour after work, or a bar or a coffee shop

I can understand the skepticism, sorry for the late reply, I never check reddit for like messages and stuff. 
We have done this for probably 12 weeks now, i am guessing, and have had no issues. Its been growing, and the idea is spreading. I say, just go with it...but I am not sure what your tolerance of ambiguity is, lol.
I have spoken with many lawyers, and heard many different things, but for the most part, individuals, doing transactions with other individuals is outside the purview of fincen, or else they should regulate garage sales, etc. We haven't had any issues, but again, to each their own...
@_date: 2013-02-13 01:44:35
I had a weird issue too. For the record, I think these guys are legit. I do however think they are growing way faster than they expected, and might not be ready for it. 
I purchased bitcoins, they emailed me saying they arrived, they weren't there. 
I emailed them, they said "looks like your issue is resolved."
It wasn't. 
Emailed again, couple of days later they responded and fixed it. 
So as I said. Nice guys, cool site, great for BTC Noobs. But I love BTC for speed of transactions, and that is slow. A week to get one coin. Bitinstant got me coins in an hour, and local would have taken a day. Bitcoins move fast, the price is volatile, and I can't wait a week to get in. 
I hope they get faster, because I think their service is vital to familiarize new people. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:48:03
the point is not in trying to bend the spoon...that is impossible, realize that there is no spoon...
bitcoins price rising isn't so much bitcoin rising, but rather the USD falling.
OK, oversimplification, but that is the general point of bitcoin, is you can keep printing more USD but you can only mine so many BTC.
There is no scenario that I can imagine where the price of hamburgers goes back to $0.05, however I can easily see them over $10. That's how fiat works (or doesn't as the case may be) The exact opposite happens in bitcoins, it fosters savings and prudence vs consumerism and debt. It's economic darwinism, and unfortunately, to continue the matrix analogy, some are too ingrained into the current system to be able to be woken up.

I wish more people wrote out their ideas, points, rants in pseudo-code, i think that maybe the inherent logical problems would become more apparent to them, ie. enforce logic.
Very good point, and I agree in some sense. I think that the demand is by far outpacing the supply and the price of bitcoins is not purely a function of its performance against the dollar, but I think that the egyptian, japanese, argentinian and venezuelan currency problems have probably helped bitcoin a little.

I agree. We have a few market makers coming tomorrow, and I will do some market making as needed to make sure there is liquidity. I expect escrow, brokering, clearing, etc all to spring up as there is need. The point is that if you are a market maker and you need a solution to your cash problems, that is your responsibility. Basically, all I am doing is saying "If you let people know where and when they can buy or sell bitcoins, you'll make it easier for them to buy or sell bitcoins"  
I am not charging commission, or anything like that. It is just an idea, which I hope others find useful. I have plans to build services, which will help people as this idea progresses. 
I honestly don't think we will reach the point of $50,000 etc. any time soon. But we will see how much demand there is. I expect at first that it will be a bunch of us bitcoin enthusiasts sitting around chatting.

I picture a bunch of these local exchanges that will eventually link together and to something like

The point of my comment which you quoted (out of context slightly) is that until we get awareness to THOSE LOOKING for bitcoins, it won't be very exciting. Most people who are involved in a bitcoin meetup group, facebook group etc, have probably figured out how to get bitcoins. The point is to lower barriers to entry for new buyers, as well as giving current holders ability to take profits, etc

Josh Rossi from New York/Panama City and I think Satoshi Square might be interested

Roger Ver is huge. Most might call him the face. Jon Matonis is a journalist who closely follows bitcoins. Erik Voorhees runs satoshidice, responsible for most bitcoin traffic. Mircea Popescu runs THE online bitcoin exchange (buy stocks and options)

Did you read the agreement? LOL, they basically are price fixing commision rates for brokering stock transactions. 
It is a nice picture though. We will be under some trees in the park :)

For fuck's sake, can no one research anything even a little bit before opening their mouth in public?

Well, hopefully it'll be "coming soon to city near you"...

Would have posted this on twitter/Facebook, but ripple is so lame I couldn't bear to, other than that, great article.

Um...u just open an account at an exchange. Oh ok. That is obviously the most pain free process. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
That is why people say its hard...if you wanted cash, would you wait 2 weeks to just "open an account"?
Compare bitcoin to existing systems, its awesome in a LOT of ways, but converting fiat to btc is not one of them. The head dev is quick to point out that it is still definitely beta. 
Point is, people naturally do whatever is easiest or most beneficial, when bitcoin becomes that, we'll see mass adoption. 
Its easy to think that its simple, because you understand

I disagree, but I suppose it will boil down to semantics. Everyone tries to get what they want. Whatever happens IMO is the aggregate weighted net value of what everyone wants. For an individual, you may not like it, but that is irrelevant. From the perspective of everyone, this is the world we chose.

I would not mind sending in a broken 3GS but it is def not in great shape, so I would do it basically for charity (no incentive to keep it)

OK, someone else mentioned this in  I am not sure if you guys are from new york or not, but here are some relevant stats.  
For that entire area, I think there may have been 53 robberies total in 2012. 2013 looks to be on track for the same. We are not talking about the bronx here. It is the middle of New York City in the middle of the day. There is literally a police precinct underneath the park.  
If someone thinks that robbing a group of 10-15 people in broad daylight in the middle of Manhattan while police are strolling around the park is a good idea, I am going to look pretty stupid I suppose...
Seriously though, I think people think we are going to be moving millions of dollars here, we aren't. It is going to probably be lots of $20, maybe a bit more. I doubt any one person sells or buys more than $1000.
Also, do you think people will show up with $50,000 in cash? I know I wouldn't, so I don't know how much anyone could expect to gain from a robbery. At the end of the day, there are acceptable risks, I suppose. This is one of them.  
New York City is one of the safest places in the US, and I bet in broad daylight in the center of a park with police around it, the chances of being robbed are approaching .001%
P.S. I hope no one has concealed weapons...they will probably do worse in NYC than the robber. There are like no guns allowed here, basically.
P.P.S. That sounded harsh, and I didn't mean it to. It's just that people think NYC is like, I don't know, beyond thunderdome? It is very nice, you can go your whole life here and never get robbed. But you were correct, I think safety in numbers, plus picking a well light, public place where police have a presence should deter any would be robbers.

You hit the nail on the head. Pretty much everything about it to me is wrong. Even if I thought the idea would work (I don't), their implementation flat out sucks. 
My problem is that it is advertised as a way to move cash into a bitcoin exchange...so wait, you managed to solve the problems with bank wires, AML, KYC etc? Oh, you didn't...so...basically just transferring the problem a level of complexity up, while adding nothing.

Satoshi Square,we are going to be doing some cool things soon...
