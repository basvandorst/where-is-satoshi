As a fellow libertarian, if only those making decisions of large scale financial impact disclose how those decisions affect their personal finances, this works for me. Ideally in my mind no one would be making said decisions.

The thing this chart doesn't tell you is that this whole market cycle fits nicely inside as a stage of a larger market cycle. 
Screwed either way. Sell and get a job.

Satoshi's funds? Someone wised up to the fact that people watch the big lump sums on the move, so this is the first basic step in getting these coins lost among all the other addresses.

This is a lie. I promise you it will not even be any one of these 180 options.

Fantastic. I was just thinking that I want one place to sort all my alts before I send them to sale/cold storage.

Blah news. Moving on.

The problem with Apple is they they don't explain the reasons justifying their actions. Apple does not care to engage anyone in conversation, but rather to shape peoples' desires and set the standards.

This is intense. time for a different coin.

Could be true, and if so, is extremely unethical and unkind. This Dorian Nakamoto - as well as his family - is now a huge walking price tag.

In the production and sale of goods, competition is great for the consumer. Doesn't work at all with forms of payment. The sheer quantities of marginally useful cryptos must make general consumers' heads spin.

I agree. I ran a full node for a while on my backup server until my good will ran out.

Pretty soon there will be a cryptocoin dev tool, and each one of us will be able to create our own coin and name it after our mothers and mine them all and swim in our imagined profits like Scrooge McDuck. 
Seriously, though, the creation of every altcoin further undermines the potential buy-in of baby-boomers, who we all know are completely baffled by bitcoin, never mind further coins, and they are the ones with all the money right now.

Prices at institutional cash for electronics companies are abysmal, and this is no exception. You are better off doing it yourself if you have the time.

KNC screwed me over as well. Don't buy from them.

"Stealth" is not the best angle to come from - you should have the right and option to keep your transactions from nosey people - this concept needs better naming, and Cryptocurrencies need better PR.
@_date: 2014-01-16 12:46:00
This title is horribly and sensationally misleading. One would think that you have found some relationship between Bitcoin payment and damaged purchases.

Erm. Wouldn't that be someone else's responsibility?

Businesses need revenue to pay for overhead and unless pertners are accepting crypto they will have to convert crypto up front to pass on to Payables. Someone who has expenses covered and should be able to get the value they set for the item they want, volatile value or not.

Only an F?
The alphabet goes as low as Z, then there are numbers and even symbols.
And yet for me that's not low enough.

This true hodler. 
He knows when market rallies to $9000 we're still in a serious dip.

Just look away and hodl. There's nothing to see here unless you were looking to close with too much emotion.

I'm just starting to use this: cex.io. You purchase by the GH/s and get paid in dividends. Given that I've been burned already by ASIC manufacturers' failed timelines, this seems like a low-risk option. Any comments?
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:57:46
Not really the point. Granted, not preordering an ASIC might be a lesson you can glean from this. 
If I ordered bananas from a Bitcoin vendor and they arrived 3 weeks late, rotten and useless - if the vendor is at fault then I would expect a full refund in my original BTC. Commercial risk should not rest on the shoulders of the consumer.
@_date: 2013-10-22 13:07:48
If the merchant is at fault, I think the burden is on his shoulders, no? If I ca make a case for his faultiness, then the payment processor should allow me to force refund in Bitcoin.
