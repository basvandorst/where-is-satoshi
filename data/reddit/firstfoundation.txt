Checkpointing is just not as good as following the chain with the most work. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 15:50:36
Distros still use the same kernel which you could analogize to the consensus rules. In that sense having multiple companies supporting different clients that follow the same rules would be good.

Can I pick then?
Bitcoin manages to build consensus among a vast array of different constituencies. Whoever should choose a checkpoint could push you into believing a minority consensus was **the** consensus. This means they could send you fake bitcoins. The effect more widely of a malicious checkpoint would be a long-lived fork or less trust in Bitcoin as a whole.

It's never been a debate. It's been an attack ever since Hearn and Andresen went on the offensive. The only thing that's somewhat alarming is the persistence. "debate", Classic, BU, rbtc all seem to be symptoms of the same disease, driven by competition from shitcoins or the state. It's popcorn on another level.
@_date: 2017-02-05 12:55:12


This hasn't been proven out. Ethereum's fork yielded two coins that are not clearly above the previous coin's value. As with all crypto there's a bit of manipulation to consider. That aside, it's hard to believe that eth will stick to its guns in any sufficiently threatening scenario. Bitcoin hasn't popped that cherry and for all we know, having never suffered a contentious hard fork is the one thing that keeps Bitcoin safe.
Bitcoin dominates the real-world resources being spent on cryptocurrency security. If it cannot last, then what could you imagine ever would?

You do realize don't you that insofar as Bitcoin is a protocol, it is one Core-supporting circle-jerk? Actually, we all jerk to the same rules that just happen to be definitively embodied in the Satoshi client's source code.
Money is the world's oldest circle jerk. Bitcoin just takes it into the digital realm.
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:56:37
Miners need to feel that the threat of change in proof of work is credible. Just as we track those in favor of segwit, we could begin to track who is on board with a POW change if segwit does not pass. Hopefully it won't come to that but if it needs to, that possibility must feel real. (it is) 
@_date: 2017-02-03 21:55:11
No, they should be able to know if they're being scammed without needing to check with anyone else. Receiving money is foundational to sending.
@_date: 2017-02-25 22:35:58
The proof-of-work function is separate from the segwit logic. Changing proof-of-work means making the hardware that specifically does sha256(sha256()) obsolete. The new hardware could follow the same or different rules as far as which transactions are valid. However, the people with the new hardware would be a different set with much lower aspirations to control the protocol.

It's a common misunderstanding that you run a node for the network. You actually run a node for security and privacy in tracking the blockchain and your balances. If you want to run a node, just look into blocks only and download only setup.

Bitcoin mining is not some absolute power. If it is abused or broken there is a way out. 
The combination of miners and users give Bitcoin its robustness. 
Don't worry about mining though. If it comes to pow change believers will be mining with vigor.

@_date: 2017-02-05 05:18:35
Perhaps miners don't want this large of an effective block size. The compromise then would be a reduction in the discount on witness data.
@_date: 2017-02-03 17:22:40
If one wants to use Bitcoin trustlessly and with best privacy, they need to run a full node at least blocks only. It is not our place to deny others that right.

You switched from do people need a full node to use Bitcoin to people must be able to use Bitcoin for low value transfers. Without a layer 2, we don't get low cost and uncensorable. It's a tradeoff.

How has it been quite clear? Is there some kind of miner survey we can point to? Have bigger blocks and you'll get a wider community but only to a point.

@_date: 2017-02-07 16:56:12

Bitcoin and PayPal aren't competitors. One is a free, uncensorable money the other is a big centralized database. 
PayPal should be as concerned with Lighting as we are about keeping the ability to run a node available for as many users as possible. 
Many more will watch the blockchain than transact upon it.

@_date: 2017-02-08 16:23:15
See my other comment. My point is we cannot tell who has real concerns and who is a Bitcoin-destroying shill. I suggest we look for code production as something that is much harder to fake than opinions on reddit. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 16:27:04
It's probably because the transactions don't fit the usual model for what people consider for payments or cold storage.
The thing about fees is that they're likely to rise so just like people say btc are still cheap, get 'em while they are, one could imagine that if you're doing something that requires a bunch of utxos or you want to split your coins up a bunch, you probably want to do that sooner than later.
@_date: 2017-02-10 01:05:31
Either they're not ready or... 
@_date: 2017-02-06 08:33:03
If you had to choose one to implement first, would you go for segwit or a block size bump?
To use Bitcoin with full security means running a fully-validating node. OP is 100% justified in their concern as with BU he has to become even more devoted to Bitcoin to every sync a node. Do we really want to push out the "nobodies"?
@_date: 2017-02-08 06:36:39
The only division is manufactured as far as I can tell. A good way to measure is in true development efforts and where they've concentrated. That's as close as we can come to a human sort of proof of work.

We're not there yet. If you're looking for mass adoption it has to be practical for Bitcoin to remain decentralized and support a massive number of transactions.

Thing is, I'm not alarmed. Bitcoin could go away and the world would move on.
But as sure as we are here, we have a chance to protect Bitcoin from changes that are overly risky. Some changes cannot be rolled back. 
Once you fork to allow - of all things - variable sized blocks, an attack (not unlike what happened to the DAO) may take the protocol to a place where you and your hardware, your bandwidth, your resources as a human being cannot keep up. Then you have to trust someone not just that they'll tell you the truth about the blockchain, or that your connection to them isn't being tampered with, but that they won't relinquish their power to an even smaller set of entities that **can** still keep up.
We should protect Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-05 08:15:17
Everyone who wants to actually use Bitcoin should run a node, not for the network but for their own sake. Only in that way can they have privacy and know they aren't being cheated either through SSL MITM or sybil/eclipse attack. Users verify what's going on by proof of work and miners compete to create that proof. Here we're seeing miners overstep their bounds by attempting to apply policy against the advancement of the protocol and for that, they should be reminded that they serve at our pleasure, not we at theirs.
@_date: 2017-02-05 08:57:08

UASF is not some node voting scheme. It's just users who transact and care about the value of their bitcoin upgrading by a certain flag day. Spinning up nodes does nothing to affect the economy behind transactions and storage. 
Also its a soft fork so miners who don't get with the program just won't be able to benefit from the massive benefits segwit can bring.

Fees could easily climb to $5-$20 per transaction if enough layer 2 money is flowing over the rails provided by on-chain transactions. That plus the extra block capacity should give us hope that Bitcoin's security can be maintained as the block reward continues to fall away.

This was the bcash design. August 1st was originally chosen by BIP 148 UASF crowd as the day that non-segwit-signalling blocks would be seen as invalid by UASF nodes. Once UASF's inevitability was clear, those that were defeated by it looked for the next best thing to do and that was to confuse the day by adding their silly hard fork.
You're probably expecting free money and may celebrate or cry about that in another 10 hours. Those of us into UASF however celebrated a few days ago when it became clear that 8/1 would be a non-event.

Bitcoin addresses have a checksum so that you're unlikely to typo them and lose your money. Unique names do not have this quality. You could use a hash of a unique name as the private key though it's not advised unless it has 128 or more bits of entropy.
Bitcoin gives you the opportunity to be your own bank so a better question of online banking vs cold storage is why might one want to be their own bank?

Soundness is based on social contract. Miners are only one part of the equation. If the users want a different Bitcoin than what miners have chosen, they can fork them off thereby defending the social contract. Many miners think the same way so with high thresholds for consensus you pull miners back into the contract. 
It may be time to realize that Bitcoin is not going to change just because you want it to.

Each onchain transaction begins under heavy lightning use to represent or support thousands of payments. Add up the pennies on all of those and we should see a strong fee market that will help security for all bitcoin users. And if it's important enough to for you to transact onchain you are welcome to pay for the privilege.

Ver is ultimately harmless because he doesn't understand why Bitcoin is actually here. He's just going to waste his money paying for sockpuppets and subsidizing miners.
He's made a ton of money with Bitcoin and that gives him some economic power but like his struggles with the fireworks business he'll learn he can't just do whatever he wants. There is always a bigger fish. Previously it was the US gov which he pretty much tries to avoid. Now it's logic and reason and there's no escape.
Funny thing is, the sooner he decides to end this sentence, or even if he doesn't and has just practiced good capital allocation, he'll get even richer.
The shame is that he could be focusing his efforts on things Bitcoin actually needs that don't happen to be blocksize related.

Incorrect. While chains don't themselves mine blocks faster or slower their price/difficulty tells you which chain will be extended faster. Difficulties will start out the same for both so if the UASF-coin is worth more, it may not take long for that chain to annihilate the other.

Our greatest mistake was not soft forking to neutralize asicboost when it was just a patent and not yet in hardware. The state should not be given purchase.

So by "btc-old with invalid segwit tx's" I assume you mean that miners will steal some of the anyone-can-spend segwit transactions. This deserves some analysis since you're basically saying that their normal minings plus the stolen coins will sell on the market for more than BTC segwit. If they don't, the hashrate won't keep up and that chain will go poof. 
BU could fork at any time so I'm not sure why they'd wait until the UASF flag day unless it's just to start in obscurity or add to the drama.

If I can summarize some of his points for the didn't watch crowd:
1) DK doesn't have a problem with hard forks because he thinks a wallet should just track both forks, spend on both, monitor both.
2) He states that investors should be in charge. In the end if people like Ver are wrong, they'll end up with less bitcoin and these issues will work themselves out.

You bring up some good points about UASF carrying some risk. It's worthwhile in this adversarial model to understand it better.

Market share is highly manipulatable. I wouldn't be surprised if Bitcoin has a lower market cap of Eth at some point if say big banks want to pump it up. It won't be hard for them to take control of it anyway. So the answer is probably to ignore that at least in part then search for a better mix of metrics by which to define success.
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:12:23
The saddest thing about Bitcoin is repeatedly being let down by people who are too smart not to know that we know they're trying to fuck us. The bright side of that is, however, blowing away any idea of idolatry. Think of Hearn, Andresen, Garzik the next time you begin to think that you can trust someone who is an expert to defend Bitcoin in the face of a potential paycheck for their pocket.

A lot of mining hash rate is using a cheat called ASICBOOST to mine more efficiently. Since not all miners have done this it has allowed them to grow their hash rate and perhaps they've even made a bet that they'll always be able to use it. In other words a very risky investment. Segwit shuts down covert ASICBOOST so they're fighting it tooth and nail.

I'm not entirely sure how it would work but basically you'd be encrypting the second courier's info with the first one's public key. The third's with the second courier's key and so on. So that's a sort of multi-hop sending method.
The money I feel could be escrowed between participants in each hop such that a fee is taken by each courier. I was kind of joking but it seems like it could work.

@_date: 2017-05-22 07:27:19
Heh. A little teamwork? Uh? A little compromise? Core shouldn't touch this with a 10-foot pole. UASF will work just fine, thanks.

You don't crash the price by operating on multiple exchanges. You find one with a weak order book and hope otherwise exchanges follow it down. A meaningful price crash here is to take $300-400 off the top.

* Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies.

So go on, please tell us how you see the segwit2x world working? Are these businesses going to take us mainstream? Make us all rich? Will they be able to restrain themselves when the other node operators with whom they will compete are heavily weakened by greater node requirements? What will be the balance for them that Core and other ethical beings have provided thus far? Tell me how it won't become PayPal, why censorship resistance would be important to them, or decentralization. Heh, maybe they'll turn Bitcoin into a PoW version of Ripple.
Have you thought this through? Or was your last thought, that it's better for you not to.

Wouldn't make sense since segwit effectively increases the blocksize. The correct answer is more likely that they want to fire core.

All of the volume you see on exchanges represents only part of the coins that are sitting on it. To increase the trade velocity of coins on exchange, they'd need to charge a storage fee or pay people to transfer them off, neither of which is really good for business.
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:55:17

You can be less suspicious. I'm opting for more suspicion each day as money is turning everyone into idiots.

There's a balance. This only works if the malicious miner can spare the hashrate to conduct the attack without endangering the non-segwit chain to be annihilated.

Compromise has no place in this very technical discussion. It's not even a debate. There are not two legitimate sides. There are those who have worked for years to preserve Bitcoin's financial sovereignty and those that wish to control it for their own special interests.

@_date: 2017-06-10 20:31:00
I believe the 1mb limit will be raised but only after we have something like lightning functioning as well. Miners may not want to allow it out of respect for their energy savings with asicboost and a likely underestimation of what fees will look like once lightning is turned on, but UASF means they'll have little choice if they want to be paid for their work. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 07:07:49
I bet Segwit2x has automatic updates. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:48:56

What's the effect on price? Hodling both until this blows over. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:07:33
That's the spirit. Of course miners matter. But users do too. Miners went too far and UASF is imminent. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:31:21
A hard fork means it doesn't follow the rules. A soft fork happens when additional restrictions are applied. Haven't you been here long enough to know this?

Whatever Jihan and Ver want to do, we'll fork against that. 
Seriously though, if a miner is cheating on pow and using that to takeover mining and restrict technical evolution of Bitcoin then the POW will be changed. They overstepped. Their hand was caught in the cookie jar and now it's time to switch to healthier snacks.

Mission accomplished from their point of view. I'm more pessimistic and believe it'll either take a UASF or PoW change to bring them along.
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:46:29
Sounds like a just the tip kind of argument. UASF will work just fine. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:41:00
If they orphan blocks, then it's pow change.

I don't think the Chinese miners want high fees and slow transactions. I think they want lots more transactions with high fees and also not to give up the discount on their energy bill which is a competitive advantage against the lawful.
What's sad is they seem to miss the potential of greater utility of Bitcoin to many more users (aka adoption) and reasonably higher (2x-10x) fees as each on-chain transaction begins to anchor for 5-7 figures (USD) worth of economic activity.

@_date: 2017-06-21 07:41:23
No, you're getting a little premature with anything being here. Signaling that you might signal, as these miners are apparently doing, is not the same as the simpler and easier to do signaling.
Segwit2x is just a more elaborate sidelining play than Classic, BitcoinUnlimited, or the very short-lived Emergent Consensus. 
UASF appears to be the way forward and support for it is building. If it happens, it'll be a very beautiful thing, sort of like Bitcoiners renewing their vows with decentrailzation, censorship resistance, and freedom.

Ethereum is a premine scam and will either go to zero or become bankchain. We don't need the them that created it.

If cheaper transactions is you want, cheaper transactions is what you'll get.

True story. Big sell walls are bullish, buy walls bearish.

Whoever is upvoting this is helping the shitcoins. Nobody reads paper ads anymore but reddit, we can protect our own.

Dan seems like good people. He can post here any day. Dan, what do you think of UASF?

Biggest mystery is what's in it for you? You just need any big blocks, or you are using asicboost, or are you genuinely concerned about forks?

As long as segwit passes.
And thanks for reminding me to update to BIP148.
@_date: 2017-06-30 23:45:17
Several!

oooh ooh... i know... i'm taking crazy pills!
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:44:14
My expectation is that a significant amount of non-Bip148 coins will be dumped and that chain annihilated as miners figure out that they don't mine for nothing.

All Bitcoiners do not want this compromise, so good luck with that.

Yes. It could generate keys that are weak in a specific way that allows the attacker to steal funds.

Bitmain feels like an arm of the PBO C. Basically I see them as a bubble in perceived ability to control Bitcoin that is about to pop. Kind of like a memeconomy thing.

Or hodl. Choose wisely.

QR codes have some redundancy in them but I guess it didn't scan, right?
Guestimating on your chances... Assuming the 1/6th from the qr code + 1/4th from the written WIF key don't overlap, you have 5/12's of the key. WIF keys are about 53 characters so you have 23 chars of base58, or 3.6 x 10^40 possibilities. For comparison, the bitcoin network hashrate is about 5.0 x 10^18.

Are you implying that Segwit2x isn't comedy enough?

People tried this before but that's not how any of this works.
