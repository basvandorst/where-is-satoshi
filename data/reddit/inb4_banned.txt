if i was the hacker id be looking into sending random small amounts the each and every adress i can find right about now.
like how many NEM adresses with more then $10 could there possibly be? depending on the transaction fees you could send millions of small txs worth a couple cents to each adress making the whole network tainted

Its complicated, but basically its being propped up by bitmain and the moment they decide they dont need it anymore it will crash.
See: EDA to make it cheap to mine, only taking bcash for s9 to create fake demand, using roger as marketing to trick noobs into thinking its not a shitcoin, asicboost, astroturfing, fake chinese nodes, colluding with coinbase, unsustainable scaling model and more
Once the math tells them that they will make more  using the 10% of their hashrate to mine bitcoin again instead of bcash, they will do that, slowly moving their hashrate back over, stop propping the price up, start accepting other cryptos for s9s, and dump it all the way down
If you really want to undersrand how bcash is a scam you need to understand what the EDA and asicboost do

obviously a trader, lol
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:24:23
use  to check the balance of an adress
then move ALL your bitcoin off the seed holding the forkcoins. this private key is now burnt forever, NEVER EVER USE THIS KEY AGAIN. then import that private key for each adress holding forkcoins into the android app bither and go to advanced settings and click "get bcd", "get sbtc" , "get btw" and send to the android app bitpie (you cannot send to the exchange directly) and check cmc to find out which exchanges have a market for the coins and then check if you can ACTUALLY deposit them on that exchange, then send them to an exchange that actually has deposits open for the coin.
many exchanges have the coins listed, but when i did this a couple days ago the only one you could actually deposit on was gate.io... the price on gate.io was lower then any other exchange, but i think this is more the real price since the exchanges that dont have deposits dont really reflect reality. if its a small amount sell forkcoins for litecoin and if you want bitcoin send those litecoin to bitstamp and sell them for bitcoin, then transfer your free bitcoin out from bitstamp for free cause bitstamp is an awesome exchange that pays outgoing txfees for you. or if its a substantial amount just buy bitcoin and take the small hit on the high withdraw fee from gate.io. 
withdrawing from gate.io took almost 6 hours to be processed, but i did get my litecoins eventually.
the bither/bitpie method only seems to work on legacy private keys, if your forkcoins are stored on a segwit adress or multisig or something the process is a huge pain in the ass (donwload and sync shady main wallet on a throwaway linux VM)... you can message u/Walleting_Services and theyll do it for you for a 10% fee or email jimmy song and have him do it for you for a fee. (i think 10 btc min, but just email and ask him)
so far the only ones i think you can claim and sell are super bitcoin, bitcoin diamond and bitcore
for bitcore i just installed coinomi on android and sweeped the private keys, that worked fine, think i sold it on hitbtc not sure was only like $50 bucks worth.
heres some more info on upcoming forks 
btw doesnt seem to be listed on an exchange yet, and i havent looked into how to split b2x yet... also no exchanges it seems so far.
if you make some free money doing this you better buy me a beer, send me some litecoin before you sell it:

ah sry i misread your comment, i though you wanted to transfer off the exchange to electrum

they batch, they use segwit, they never go down when it matters and they pay the outgoing transaction fees for you

It was abused by miners to game the system.
Wait for diff to emergency adjust down, point lots of hashrate at the bcash chain and mine blocks at like 1 block per minute or more, then once the diff adjusts, point hashrate back at bitcoin and wait for eda to kick in again.
This caused massive problems for bcash, and made block times on bitcoin slightly longer.
Im pretty sure they hardforked again to fix it... Thats also a funny story, theres just one dev that decides and apperently he liked the diff adjustment algorithm he proposed the most so thats the one they chose, cant make this shit up

yup i could totally see that... all these crypto debitcards are basically having a run on the bank right now... their cards dont work anymore so most users want their money out right now... 
and either they dont have enough bitcoin cause they are doing some fractional fuckery, or they simply think the users wont come back once they fix it.

Most if not all of this already applies to normal hotwallets. You always have an incentive to hack computers that contain private keys with bitcoin. If anything lightning just makes it more complicated

all wavecrest based cards stopped working today... which is basically all of them i think.
heres a good video i found when i looked into it a week ago:
i currently have a xapo card, but it charges me 3% for each transaction that isnt in euro... which is every transaction for me... after my research i ordered a tenx card, but they are sold out, and im only on the waitlist. itll take 8+ weeks to get a card, and now with all this wavecrest shit going on maybe even longer
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:07:32

go back 10-15 years and the comparison to paypal makes more sense... paypal is now established, but imagine if you wanted to use it back when it was new and unproven and your bank went "nah we wont let you transfer money to this paypal thing, they are competeing with us, we dont like that"
any bank that wont let you have 100% full control over your money should immediatly lose the privilege to hold your money imo

we really dont need these weird in the middle denominations, they will just lead to more confusion. we already have an estblished small denomination: satoshis.
just wait until bitcoin is worth 100k and then use satoshis kinda like yen: 1000 sats = $1

i know how, im just lazy and would like to be able to run it directly on my windows full node, i guess i could put it on one of the ubuntu vms running on that box, but seems silly to run two full nodes on the same computer... and you can absolutely google instructions, heres one example:


you sound like a pretentious prick when you say shit like this, you know that right?
"only the linux CLI masterrace is allowed to risk their own money and test lightning on mainnet. if you are too dumb to use linux, compile your own client and run everything with cli you shouldnt even attempt to try"

NO. if the crypto debitcard you are using doesnt offer full control over your coins i wont use it. my xapo card allows me to deposit and withdraw whenever i want. it stopped working yesterday, so i removed all funds. using a card that can only be loaded, but not emptied is just stupid imo
and of course you only send a fraction
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:06:03
... once you are done with half the cards you just shuffle them and start at the top again? you NEED 256, you cant make one with just 52
the concept is the same, you need 256 bits of entropy, if those bits came from your computer, heads/tails or black/red doesnt really matter
i see what you mean with 26/26, but you can avoid that pretty easy by shuffling every so often and not doing the whole deck

i doubt there will be any... cause who the fuck holds bcash and knows enough about bitcoin to actually claim their forkcoins... i think the overlap there is very very minimal since anyone that actually understands bitcoin thinks bcash is a shitcoin and has already dumped it... also forks of forks? bcash cash? bitcoin bcash? cmon man thats stupid... then again there is friggin bitcoin pizza coming up x)

its a custodial wallet. you do not own the private key, but you can deposit and withdraw like any other wallet.
their fees are kinda fucked, way to high, but that seems to be a general problem for custodial wallet at the moment.
i paid 19 bucks for a "slow" withdraw that was supposed to take "6 blocks"... but it was confirmed within 10 minutes... so i way overpaid.... i wish they had a superslow option cause i checked the mempool and there was really no reason for that high fee. id gladly wait a day if it meant i only had to pay $4
the way i understood that guys comment was that he can ONLY deposit bitcoin, but not withdraw it, only spend it with the card... and the card doesnt work now so his money is stuck.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:35:48
As long as they can keep the house of cards standing and make some extra bitcoin mining the very easy bcash chain with asicboost they will do it, but as soon as it become unprofitable to them to prop it up they WILL let it die

i couldve sworn i already have a channel open with them, but lnds gui is kinda terrible, cant even check who the channels are with once they are open, the only option i have is "close channel"
this is the node for the eclair devs right?
at least thats the one i get on eclair android when i say autojoin, and i couldve sworn i had already added that one to LND, but ill try again
i gotta say so far im liking eclair a LOT more then LND, lnd is just very sluggish and lacks information... half the time i dont know if its doing something at all. click open channel... nothing happens... wait... wait... oh its doing something
so in general to avoid issues here while testing i should open a channel with whatever service i wanna use first?
im willing risk some money to get those stickers, so once im done with testing on testnet im gonna move on over to mainnet and open some channels
do you have any recommendation as to which wallet and/or software i should if id like to avoid fucking around with CLI and linux?

dag based coins are unproven and have different scaling problems. iota has a ton of problem and how it will scale we really dont know yet. concerns are handwaved away which is very worrying. for example they are using a centralized coordinator right now and without that the whole network would break. they also broke the number 1 rule of cryptography: dont roll your own crypto... and it came and bit them in the ass.
there many more issues with all these dag based currencies, sure they are interesting, but right now they are not much more then an experiment. i wouldnt trust them with my money longterm

ALL cryptos trade at a 30% premium, so the only way to arbitrage between korean prices and the rest of the world is if you can get fiat out... maybe you can do something with USDT? i dont know if they have that

@_date: 2018-01-21 19:18:19
lol no its not, everyone that knows what they are doing split off their forkcoins asap and dumped that shit. nobody that actually understands bitcoin is buying these shitforks
so far ive sold: bcash, btg, bitcore, b2x, super bitcoin, bitcoin diamond, fast bitcoin, bitcoin faith and btw and more to come
each time its the same shit: the moment the deposits open on an exchange the price crashes by 80-90% and never recovers, the sell book is a race to the bottom and the buy book is empty except 2-3 lowball offers... but still SOMEONE is buying this garbage, and i thank them for the free money
the only way you get your bitcoin dividends is if you are smart and quick enough to split them and dump them in the first week after its possible to sell them, if you dont do it fast enough youll just end up with worthless shitforks
you could make the argument that all the money that used to flow into ONLY bitcoin is now flowing into crypto in general, but saying its "supporting 3 hardforks" is just retarded... there are like 20 shitty hardforks, nobody cares, we just dump that shit and move on

i ordered only tenx at first too (after my wavecrest card broke) but after thinking about it and evaluating all the cards i came to the conclusion that monaco and tenx are about equal and i literally dont lose anything ordering both and its always good to hedge your bets and diversify... its a race now... who can deliver first?
if they deliver at all that is...
just whatever you do dont order a centra card, that shit looks like a total scam
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:14:22
we want random why do we care if the odds change?
as long as you shuffle every couple of cards i think its plenty random... also i wasnt really thinking of removeing the cards from the deck, id just add them back to the bottom
a shuffled deck of cards is plenty random, but it does have the problem that its exactly 50/50 red/black, so you ahve to avoid that somehow... so as long as you dont do all 52 cards before restarting it wont be 50/50

right now if you pay something like 100-200 sats you WILL get in the very next block... so there is really no reason to pay anything beyond that
i just used bitpie to sell some of my shitforks... and withdrawing the bitcoin from that shitty wallet cost a fee of 0.001... that was the lowest fee you could set... you dont even get to set the sat/byte, all you get to change is miner fee -2 &lt;-&gt; +2... whatever that means... goddamn chink wallet... terrible, just terrible
i checked the TX and they paid 735 sats per byte... 735!!!!
thats 700 sats to many, 35 wouldve gotten confirmed in the same block
i kinda suspect that there are some wallet and services that are still trying to push the narrative that bitcoin has high fees... or their just really really really bad

reposting my comment cause i really dont understand why you would order a monaco card:
a week ago i looked into debit cards again. i currently have a xapo card that charges me 3% international fee for each transactions, so i really wanted a different one. after my research I ordered a tenx card. monaco lost HARD, not only do they not have any cards out (so possible vaporware) they lost on the fees and a lot of the details arent disclosed.
just look at the chart in this video. monaco is terrible, just terrible
1% transaction fee on every single transaction is already a huge deal breaker for me. then look at all the unclear details when it come to monaco. i wouldnt trust that company with my money.
also the name is dumb as hell.

dogecoin community was based on generosity
guy shows up, really nice guy, donates a bunch of money n shit, everyone like him, then proceeds to take over mintpal, a new small exchange at the time, doge community uses this exchange
turns out nice guys isnt so nice, but is a serial scammer using fake names n shit... doge community is like lambs to the slaughter
he basically takes all the money and does an exit scam
later goes to prison for rape
i recently got an email from some police thing so their still looking into it.
not sure if hes still in prison for rape or if hes now in prison for ripping of millions
thats the gist of it, i may be misremebering some details
if you wanna read up on this scumbag just google:
"ryan kennedy scammer"
that guy is a real pos and im happy hes rotting in prison
not sure if the funds ever got recovered, but if they havent chances are he still owns them (by remembering the seed and storing the priv key somewhere secret)

@_date: 2018-01-11 04:43:00
but doge is faster and cheaper then btrash... hmm?
bcash wasnt designed as a joke, it IS a joke.
bcash is a scam coin being pushed by roger ver, propped up by bitmain, with massive scaling issues AND full on centralization, full blown covert asic boost, no segwit, no innovation, no longterm vision, mined at all times at &gt;51% by one entity making a 51% attack possible at any time. The only reason bcash has low fees is because nobody is fucking using it. 8mb blocks? lol they cant even fill their blocks up to 1 mb x)
it doesnt even process as many transactions as dogecoin, a coin designed as a joke:
their blocks are consistently pretty damn empty (again cause nobody with half a brain want to use this scam)
heres a comparison of the amount of transaction processed to bitcoin, eth and litecoin...
"scaling" on a blockchain that nobody uses is really easy. just do nothing.
theres only like a 1000 nodes for bcash worldwide and like 70%+ of those are running in the chinese alibaba cloud (probably all run by bitmain)
dogecoin despite not having a single change in over two years is still a better coin compared to btrash.
not a single respectable dev in this space will work on bcash, if you really think bcash has "four independent development teams" working on it i have a bridge to sell you. bcash has zero innovation. nada. zilch.
both dogecoin and litecoin can make the claim that they are 99.9% the same. 
bcash is nothing but shitty hostile takeover attempt by roger and jihan and if you fall for rogers stupid ass propaganda then you kinda have it coming. bcash is an attempt by the chinese miners to control bitcoin. they are creating artificial demand by only accepting bcash for their S9 miners. nobody want to buy bcash, but if you want an S9 (which a lot of people do) you are forced to buy some.
bcash uses massive astroturfing to spread their narrative, and for the past couple of months there has been a full on misinformation campaign going on and i feel sorry for you if you cant see past the surface level propaganda. 
roger the main marketing man behind bcash is despicable humanbeing that should be avoided at all cost, who preys on noobs in the space. if you truly think bcash has any redeeming qualities youve been had; hook, line and sinker.
there are literally hundreds of cryptos that have fast and cheap transactions, its nothing special. having fast and cheap transcations AT SCALE is what matters.
thepiratebay recently updated their bitcoin donation adress and added segwit. heres what they added for the bcash adress:
Bcash. LOL
they dont even want it if they can get it for free
tl;dr: youre an idiot, do some fucking research and dont believe rogers lies.

yes thats exactly why.
check out  for some more information although that site doesnt go very far back
on this chart you can see the spikes in hashrate where they were mining empty bcash blocks at break neck speed, and then once the diff adjusted they would move back to bitcoin resulting in hours between blocks for bcash... theyd then wait until the eda kicks back in once or twice and start churning out blocks again:
zoom in on the part with bcash:
bcash was made by bitmain, for bitmain, so they can keep using asicboost

Darkcoin turned into dash
Dogecoindark turned into verge
Verge is a straight up scam.
Dash is also kinda a scam with its instamine and 200k masternodes which pretty much all belong to the founders, making them like 70k per masternode and removing something like 80%+ coins from circulation creating a fake high price
Id stay far far away from both coins. 
These are coins that thrive off of marketing mostly

nobody really knows exactly, but its a combination of:
more segwit transactions
less demand for transactions (because of the lower price and attention right now)
a lot of mining power has been added lately so the average time per block is like 7.5 minutes or something like that right now (until the next difficulty adjustment)

im not really into "cashback"... and you get it in their stupid token and its "up to" as in you get nothing
you have to buy the super expensive card for 50k of their stupid token to get 2%... thats 850k usd lol
the normal pleb card gives you no cashback at all.
that video also isnt the only resource i looked at. i did my research and monaco lost hands down imo
a lot of the information on monaco isnt available or very hidden. they dont have any cards out yet, so right now all they have is a pretty website and some promises. could be vaporware.
also the normal pleb card has a $200 atm withdraw limit... and after that they charge you a 2% fee... % based fees for atm withdraws? no fucking thx.
to get anything other then the free pleb card you have to spend at least $850+ on their stupid token... yeah NO, not gonna happen. the way they structured this shit is obviously to push their token.
trying to find detailed information on fees and stuff is really hard which again just kinda screams scam to me.
looking at this
there is also a 2% international atm withdraw fee which is nowhere to be found on their website. for me that would be every single atm withdraw... so after the first $200 is it then 4%? who knows the details are not clear...
and they dont even have a card out yet which is already more then enough reason for me to not want to do business with them
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:24:03
you have to buy their stupid token and lock it for 6 months... id rather just pay a one time fee of 15 bucks then hold 850 bucks worth of shitcoins hoping theyll still be worth anything in 6 months.
there is literally no lies in my comment, everything is taken from their website. but whatever you say man... drop me a comment when you finally get your card... im on the waitlist for Tenx and they told me itll be 8+ weeks, wanna bet ill get mine first? :P
also according to todays update video from TenX they are also a direct partner with a banking license now... not that that means anything until they can actually provide cards, but just saying.

but dude if you have thousands worth of dogecoin id look into selling that asap.
i mined a million dogecoin back in 2013-14 and sold then just about 2 weeks to early at the beginning of 2017... i sold for like 30 sats and then it spike to 120 sats and now its STILL at 60 sats... doge has spiked like crazy twice this year for no reason and id really look into moving those funds into something more stable like bitcoin, litecoin or ethereum right about now... i doubt youll ever get another chance to get THIS much for doge.
doge is literally at an usd ATH right now, just look at the chart
the crypto market is currently insane and i recommend you take that doge profit and reinvest it in something a little more sustainable

How do i find the privatekey for a change adress.
I just sold all my fork coin (sbtc/bcd/bitcore) using the bither/bitpie method after moving all my funds off my ledger and extracting the key using the bip39 tool.
I still have some more forkcoins on a change adress, but i cant seem to find the private key belonging to that adress. I sent transaction from a bip44 adress and have 0.67 in forkcoins sitting in the resulting change adress. All my real bitcoin are safe and migrated to a new seed, but id like to have full control over all my old private keys so i can sell future forks if they actually become sellable (like b2x)
The change adress doesnt seemto be listed under bip44, where do i find it?

theres kinda big mathematical difference.
im talking about people with billions... with a B... not 100 million, billions, multiple fuckin billions. i really have a hard time imaging why anyone would need that much money.
im fine with being filthy fucking rich, but at a certain point you really gotta stop and wonder when is it enough? why do you need that much money when literally 99.9999% of people do just fine with a tiny tiny fraction of that. what could you possibly buy with that much money that wouldnt be able to buy with 100mil?
if an average person makes 100k a year (which they dont), and you have 1 billion, that 10'000 years of work for the average person assuming they never spend a penny.
the difference between actual poor people (in the thirdworld) and normal people (in the west) is NOTHING when you look at the difference between the ultra wealthy and everyone else..
to them it doesnt matter if you make $2.5, $25, or $250 an hour, they have such an obscene amount of money its hard to even imagine
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:49:46


lol its the most secure crypto by a large margin, da fuck you talking about? sounds like youre just talking out your ass


lol how so? its the best privacy coin with the best privacy tech, dominates cpumining and darknetmarkets... how exactly is it a "joke"? im all ears...


you can (ab)use eth as currency just fine, idgaf what the "intended" usage is. if you compare eth and ltc as currency they are both about identical right now


let me guess? youve been in this space for all off 3 months? heres the scoop kiddo: the "high fee" situation has been a temporary situation over the past couple of weeks, sure theyve been kinda high lately, but they are coming down as we speak and with lightning and other 2nd level solutions they will become so low any coin that only has "low transaction fees" as a selling point will die an agonizing death pretty quickly.
the thing with blockchains is they are very easy to scale if nobody is using them... what matters is if they hold up AT SCALE. which 99% of coins have not proven yet.
i like litecoin, i really do, but thinking its anything but a bitcoin clone with some values changed is delusional... any and all problems bitcoin runs into litecoin will have just the same, so saying it will overtake bitcoin really doesnt make any sense

you are hearing something i didnt say. i never said i wanna forbid it, or make it illegal or anything like that... im just questioning it. does it make sense that some people hoard billions while ohers hungry?
google is a company, not an individual. companies having billions is something else imo. imo at a certain point an individual has so much wealth that wanting even more seems kinda silly... sure its their right to accumulate billions, but does it make sense? after a certain point, not really...
this has nothing to do with jealousy.
do you think there is an amount of money that an individual can own where its "enough" and more isnt really needed? (not saying we should for bid more or anything like that) if yes whats the number? 1billion? 100 billion? a trillion?
or do you think a person that owns trillions and still wants more is normal and ok?

if it where that easy everyone would do it. from what ive heard all coins sell for 30%+ in korea
you cant send or withdraw fiat money beyond some limit of like 50k per year in and out of korea
and 
you need to be verified on all of these korean exchanges to be able to use them, and they only allow koreans
its probably possible somehow, but its not easy
best i could come up with was: buy in the west, send crypto to korean friend, have him sell crypto at a 30% premium and withdraw fiat, use fiat to buy gpu mining hardware and setup mining farm, have him mine more crypto for you or send you the equip, rinse repeat
although with shit like taxes and time delays this probably wouoldnt work

i ordered a 6 pack for 100 bucks, should get here in a couple days.
i kinda like the idea of having 0.01 bitcoin that i can use a like a gold coin.
but if im being honest with myself the only use i see currently is gifting bitcoins to people... 
and it isnt even that great for that since you cant backup the private key and if its lost or breaks the coins are gone forever

i actually had a game concept for this.
sell game for $15, use $5 of that to buy crypto (this could be your own coin) and give it to player. make players start in the game with $5 worth of currency and make them lose it (or part of it) on death, allow unrestricted pvp, invading and trade. build ingame money sinks that go back to devs and are used for in game drops. 
use part of the computer resources to mine more crypto to expand the economy of the game. dont give players mined currency, make them earn it through drops
allow players to withdraw (but not deposit to stop pay to win)

its kinda a chicken/egg problem i see that.
electrum on android does not warn you. it also doesnt give you an option for a p2sh adress or a legacy adress or explain anything... it just gives you a bech32 adress and then when you want to send something to it the other wallet says "what is this shit?"...
that a pretty terrible user experience.
i recommended the wallet to my brother so i could send him 0.01 as a christmas present and then looked like a fool :P magic internet money: it just works... wait why isnt it working... gimme a sec... this should really work... it usually works... i dunno whats going on, wait brb...
then i went and checked stuff on the wallet i was sending from first and then 5 minutes later i realized what the problem was...
this could all be avoided if they just gave users an option, but even after i figured out what the problem was i couldnt generate a p2sh adress and had to delete electrum and install greenbits

no they show the exchange price
it will say something like you are selling 0.012 bitcoin @ $9001 and will receive $100
instead of you are selling 0.012 bitcoin ($115) for $100
of course that would mean they would have to ackknowledge the actual marketprice instead of their own price with the spread

Dont kid yourself mate, if you have any crypto youre a speculator


I disagree strongly with what you wrote here. This stuff is simply not based on reality. A small minority of bcash idiots are trying to coopt the name, the coomunity stands behind the real bitcoin, there is no "split". Just cause some altcoin added bitcoin to its name doesnt divide the community. Do you think the community is split between between the real bitcoin and bitcoin gold? How bout bitcoin diamond? No this is just business as usual in cryptoland, pumpers will pump, dumpers will dump, let them have their fun. But please dont act like were devided cause thats straight up bs. 
The whole censorship thing... Well ive never really experienced it tbh, ive been posting on here with various accounts for quiet some time and ive never been censored... Im not saying it doesnt happen im just saying maybe what people call censorship is just plain old moderation cause i know that theres no fukin chances tjis subbreddit wouldnt be shilled to hell and back without moderation.
And finally we get to the evil core/blockstream talking point. This one is just so dumb i dont really know where to start. Do you really believe this? Like seriously? Or are just parroting something you heard someone else say?
Do you really think that the bitcoin developers that got us this far want to break bitcoin on purpose? Are you high? Do you hear yourself? Where do you get this shit lol
You do know that 2nd layer solutions are optional right?
I also didnt recommend ltc or eth as alternatives to bitcoin. I mentioned them as better alternatives compared to bcash. Thats kinda a big difference. I still trust bitcoin waaaay more then i do any of these other alts.
Bitcoin is the most secure, its the most decentralized, it has the network effect, its been around the longest and has the most trust, the whole eco system is built on it... It has a lot more going for it then just the first mover advantage, but if you cant see that and want to invest in so random alt be my guest.

CNBC, coinbase and roger are all very intimately linked to bcash. they are currently trying to steal as much market share from bitcoin as they possibly can by spreading fud about bitcoin (and dumping) and promoting bcash (and pumping)
so yes they do care about sabotaging bitcoin. hell roger has pretty much straight up come out and admited to it like a shitty comic book villain. he really really wants to kill bitcoin and make his own shitty version the "real" bitcoin
for coinbase and cnbc, it isnt as obvious, but if you read between the lines, look at how they are acting and who they assosciate with it become pretty clear that they are pushing bcash hard. you really dont have to be a genius to figure this one out. 
for example: on the day bcash suddenly start trading (even though its not supposed to go up until jan and withdraw only) roger ver gets invited on to cnbc fast money to promote hist bcash shitcoin, and talk about how shitty bitcoin is... the marketing manager of CNBCs husband is the director of the bitcoin chash fund. all the while the price oddly is 3x what it is on any other exchange, but nobody can sell cause they turned it off (cause they dont want it to crash hard) cant make this shit up


oh god the stupid, it hurts. I know what it is, how it works and why its important. speak for yourself lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:39:33
Coinbase is ripping you off.
They batch process their transcations (or they should) there is absolutley no reason why you should have to pay the miner fee yourself. They only pay it once for 100s of transactions, but charge each customer $30? Thats straight up a scam
Withdraws from bitstamp are free as they should be. If you did the same exact thing with bitstamp it wouldve worked instantly with no fee
Oh and also bitpay overcharges like a motherfucker.

seems pretty accurate. anybody that pretends to know better is either lying or an idiot. if you knew where the markets gonna go youd be rich af.
price went down like 30% over the past 2 days.... those pizzas i bought a week ago are looking pretty damn cheap right now...
using bitcoin when your up XXXX% is just profit taking. if it goes back down, great, you can rebuy, if it goes up, no biggie you couldve maybe made more, but you didnt know that for sure.
if you are 100% sure bitcoin will keep going up then spend every last penny on it right fukin now mate... but nobody knows that for sure, so just fucking use it when your up and buy more when your down. it really isnt rocket science... the whole argument boils down to greed: "but i couldve made more if i waited" ... YOU DONT KNOW THAT FOR SURE
this small correction today just proved my point nicely. bitcoin doesnt ALWAYS go up. every purchase ive made over the past week has been at a discount, cause i just rebought the btc

@_date: 2017-12-21 14:23:43
imo this is a temporary situation caused by network spam from bcash people trying to push their narrative. im not worried, the mempool will empty soon enough, probably right after jihan and co dump all their bcash on the noobs that fell for their narrative. And then theyll start pumping those gains back into bitcoin, theyll stop spamming the network at the same time causing a new bull run and new ATH... which they of course massively profit from since they mine a big chunk of all new coins
i highly doubt the current state of the mempool and txfees is organic

people up 10'000%+ and fees are high for a couple weeks while bcash does its thing and everybody loses their goddamn mind? what happened to hodl? what happened to long term? im not worried about fees today, or tomorrow, heck im not even worried about fees in a week or a month, im worried about fees in 5 years when we ACTUALLY need the capacity


what insults?? def didnt try to insult you
did you mean this?


didnt mean you specifically more like people posting impatiently in general, def no offense intended, just sounded fun
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:00:00
im not your buddy, guy...
let me spell it out for you.
coinbase charges you fee when you want to withdraw, a really high fee, supposedly cause they have to pay for the network transaction fee, but then when they process the transactions they dont do each transaction individually, that would be stupid, no they bundle a bunch of outgoing transaction into one and process them as a batch, that way they only have to pay 1 transaction fee for 100+ withdraws... so they charge you, but pocket the money.... and if they AREN'T batch processesing they are either incompetent or willfully malicious.
if bitstamp can do it they can aswell. there is absolutley NO reason to pass on the cost of OUTGOING transactions for these big companies.
if he used his own wallet he could set the fee sat/byte fee way lower and just wait a while, i paid $3 a couple days ago, not $30... but thats besides the point here since were talking about how coinbase rips of its users with fake txfees for outgoing transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:48:18

@_date: 2017-12-26 16:14:48
if you had the private keys on forkday, google "how to split bcash yourwallethere"
if you had the coins on an exchange youll just have to wait for them to give them to you if that hasnt happened yet.
then once you have your bcash split, simply convert them to bitcoins using shapeshift or changelly (anon no signup) or transfer them to a exchange that has bcash and sell them
id do this as fast as possible since really i only see bcash going down over time.
get your free money while its still worth something...
oh and also you probably also have "bitcoin gold" which is another fork... each bitcoin gold is worth around $300 (or at least thats what i sold mine for) so thats another split youll have to do to collect your free money
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:40:25
not thats not the point at all. they are stealing from you. they are not "subsidizing" anything. they are simply pocketing the money you pay for the txfee and the batch processing the withdraws as one transaction.
so lets say they have 100 withdraws in 10 minutes, and each customer pays a withdraw fee of $10. thats $1000 in fees that would go to miners IF they did each transaction individually which they dont. they then take those 100 withdraws and make a batch transaction with 100 outputs, paying a one time TX fee of maybe i dunno $50 or $100... pocketing the other $900 as pure profit.
any company that does dozens of transactions every 10 minutes should be doing batch processing and offer free withdraws (since it costs them almost nothing to do)
are you being willfully ignorant or do you really not understand the issue here? for such a big company to pay each TX fee individually would be incredibly stupid, this has nothing to do with subsidizing. doing batch transactions with many outputs saves both the company and the customers a boat load of money, theres really no reason to NOT do it...
the proof is in the pudding. if bitstamp can offer free withdraws so can coinbase. the only reason they dont is because they are greedy or incomptent or both

i didnt say using a debit card means they are accepting bitcoin.
its still spending bitcoin. sure its ugly, centralized, not trustless, completely against the spirit of bitcoin and a stopgap solution, but it does work.
and yes i would say that if you can do the same with gold then you are spending gold. you cant do that with soybean futures cause there is no service that provides you an easy way to do that. but if there was an soybean futures debit card then id argue that yes you can spend soybean futures in any store (in a roundabout way)

well its not literally a "scam", but its at the same level.
if they charge each customer the network fee but only pay one network fee for X customers bundled together and pocket the difference they are milking their customers.
sure for THEM its great business, but I personally would not want to do business with a company that milks its customers so dishonestly.
if they dont batch process they a partially responsible for the current high fee situation. i dont know which is worse
if bitstamp can offer free withdraws, so can coinbase, there is really no excuse

this is simply not true.
the COMMUNITY refused a rushed contentious hardfork (s2x) because the way they wanted to do it was straight up terrible.
theres a BIG difference
weve just barely activated segwit and you impatient fucks are already complaining about the next step. you want everythin now now now. like little children that cant see the bigger picture.
i have no problem waiting for a proper scaling solution. im patient and i know that proper software development takes time. I also know that bcashs "solution" is not viable and the only reason they have cheap fees is cause nobody wants to use their shitty coin. 
your comment has a lot of speculation as to how exactly lightning will work out, how fast it will be adopted... things nobody can possibly even try to guess today... so spare me the crystal ball talk please, you dont fukin know any better then i do.


my bitcoin is worth waaaay more then the the fucking txfees so i dunno what your on about with this part.

its not a "good" thing, its just more realistic then the $30 that keeps getting posted over and over... sure SOME people are paying $30, but there are also many many transactions that are waaaay lower then that.
for reference i paid i think 120sats/byte and withing a couple hours it was confirmed... at the time that was around $3 and since i was moving 0.33 in bitcoin im ok with that fee. sure id like it to be less, but until the slow ass exchanges all adopt segwit thisll have to do.
also you do know that retail BTC all works on 0 conf right?
even with perfect free fee retail btc will still use 0 conf, cause what are you gonna do stand around in the shop for 10 minute until it gets confirmed? nah, theres a certain amount of trust involved, and the retail shop just takes that risk and assumes you wont try to commit fraud and double spend a fucking coffee purchase...
so any and all arguments that boil down to "but muh retail coffee" are kinda silly, since even if we had perfectly reliable 10 minute for 1 confirmation for free, it would make no difference how retail btc is used. (for low amounts)
the merchant doesnt care if it takes a couple hours or a day to confirm, heck visa takes like 3-4 days  before you can be sure it wont be charged back

bitstamp uses batch transactions. which means all your outgoing transactions are batched together with other peoples transactions. this means bitstamp only has to pay one txfee for many peoples withdraws. this makes the txfee so cheap for them that they can offer free withdraws to their customers.
so you can leave any amount of bitcoin (it doesnt have to be tiny, but dont leave your coins on the exchange, so only leave your spending money is what i meant) on bitstamp and use the withdraw feature to send around bitcoin for free.
it doesnt matter where you are sending the funds, the withdraw is free for you. if you wanna deposit money youll have to pay the normal txfee, but since the withdraws are free, you can just deposit once and then use the bitstamp wallet to send money to friends and merchants for free
im pretty sure gdax has the same thing, which makes it even greedier that coinbase doesnt

ideally all services such as exchanges and wallet would update their service to support segwit asap and then inform their customers that they now support segwit. the user really doesnt have to know anything more then "my wallet supports segwit"... they really dont have to know the technical detail of how segwit works to use it... since using segwit is literally exactly the same as using bitcoin normally: you copy paste the adress, adjust the fee and click send, theres really nothing to it
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:08:54
Give it time. The current high fee situation will pass. Bcash will die, network spam will go away, scaling will keep improving.
Until then just be patient and dont fall for their narrative. And if you wanna do free transactions right now just leave a tiny amount of bitcoin on bitstamp

yes. miners have a huge economic incentive to drive up the average fee, doubly so right now because they are trying to pump their own sha256 shitcoin (bcash).
if you control a substantial amount of mining power you can mine your own transactions for free, if you collude with other mining pools (maybe by say creating a new sha256 shitcoin together, or simply agreeing that "these" transactions are "free" for the good of all miners) you could save almost all of your own transaction fees.... and dont forget, that by driving up the average fee you profit on the other end.
so if it cost X to spam the network and you control 2/3 of the mining hashrate through various means so you only have to pay 1/3x and by doing so you increase the average total fees paid per block by Y%.
as long as Y% &gt; 1/3X youd be stupid to NOT spam the network.
the miners know that full blocks leads to high fees, they directly profit from high fees, they do not want second level solutions that enable scaling without paying more fees directly to miners.


you do not have to pay the high fees to raise the average fee, you just have to fill the blocks enough so that the market takes care of the rest (by naturally competeing for the now artificially limited blockspace)
spammers dont care how long it takes to confirm
they dont even have to be colluding, each mining pool could be doing the individually and the end effect would be the same (theyd just pay little extra for the spam)
sure some of the networks usage is from organic growth, but dont be fooled into thinking that there isnt some fuckery going on

imma make this real simple:
i had bitcoin, i spent bitcoin, now i dont have bitcoin instead i have a product.
i didnt sell bitcoin for dollars and then use the dollars to buy something, thats two steps.
i did it in one step. i directly spent my bitcoins in a store. sure its actually still two steps, but its all automated and abstracted away so as a customer i dont see any off that. i just know: i spent X bitcoin, and got Y 
its not ideal, since you now have a 3rd party and visas grubby little fingers back in the game, but arguing that that isnt "spending" bitcoin is stupid.
using a "gold"-debit card (if such a thing exists) is spending gold. i dont give a single fuck what they are doing to make it happen, i just know i sent them some heavy metal and now i have this plastic card that buys me pizza with that heavy metal
anything that is liquid enough that a 3rd party can provide such a service effectively becomes money

any exchange that passes on the network fee for withdraws is shit imo. they can batch transactions, they can use segwit. if bitstamp and gemini can offer free withdraws so can coinbase... heck gdax which is the same company offers free withdraws... so really they are just ripping off noobs that are not on gdax and buy directly from coinbase. if you transfer over your bitcoin to gdax from coinbase i think you can withdraw for free... which is a really dumb and roundabout system.
just use bitstamp. ive done business with both companies and coinbase just kinda sucks compared to bitstamp

yes they are... actually its even worse: they batch process their transactions, so for example: they charge a hundred customers the txfee but only have to pay it once themselves... there is absolutley NO reason that they should be passing on the outgoing tx fee to customers, it makes no sense. if bitstamp can offer free withdraws by batch processing their transcations coinbase can aswell, but they dont cause they are making money hand over fist each time someone withdraws... they are a greedy shitty company that preys on the noobs in the space.
outgoing transactions from companies that do hundreds of txs every 10 minutes must be free. anything less and you getting ripped off or dealing with an incompetent company

No. Unless the price goes waaaaay down the block reward will still be plenty for a loooong time
Also you can still do onchain transactions and opening a channel or closing it is still a normal onchain bitcoin transaction
Also hashrate kinda self adjusts, as it gets less profitable some miners may get out which reduces the difficulty which makes it more profitable for the remaining miners. Bitcoin really doesnt care how much hashrate there is blocks always come every 10 minutes

is using a service like bitpay not "using bitcoin as money" in your eyes cause the merchant can choose to convert to fiat instantly?
does buying something on paypal and paying with euros even though paypal converts that to dollars instantly make euros not a currency?
anything that has value and is sufficiently "money-like" can be used as money.

bcash is basically a shitty chinese knockoff of bitcoin. they are trying to steal the name "bitcoin" so they can trick noobs such as yourself into buying their shitty centralized coin. they are pushing the narrative of bitcoin not being good because high fees, and bcash being great cause of low fees... do not fall for their narrative, the only reason they have cheap fees is because nobody wants to use their shitty coin... also there are dozens of other better coins with cheap fees such as litecoin or ether.
the reason some people on here may be very rude or hostile to you for asking such simple noob questions is that there is a lot of astroturfing going on trying to push their narrative with seemigly innocent questions... so its hard to tell if you are noob or just a paid shill, and some people will just assume you are paid and treat you as such

i think youre right on the money
they are dragging their feet on purpose
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:45:45


the way the theory goes is that they are mining their own transactions for free.
so id say any transaction that has the sole purpose of fulling up the blocks and then gets mined for free by the miners is spam. 
i get your point, its really hard to differentiate, thats why there is no proof currently, but i think the main difference is that i do not have a mining farm to make certain transactions cost nothing and my transactions have a further purpose other then to use up capacity


this is sadly very true, my hope here is that longterm incentives line up for miners and bitcoin and that theyll eventually stop to avoid hurting themselves to much, currently they can get short term profits by abusing the system, but if they want bitcoin to survive theyll have to stop eventually and switch over to the longterm strategy when the mainstream comes... 
disclosure: i dumped all my bcash the moment i got my hands on it. i advise everyone do the same. if your worried about bitcoin scaling problems and want to invest in the competition i recommend litecoin and ethereum. i would not recommend bcash to anyone since i think a lot of people will lose money on it, because longterm it will fail.

im some random dude on the internet, i dont have to paste proof for shit. 
when i say "the miners" mostly refers to the big chinese mining pools, many of which are inofficially owned by the same people. and if they arent owned by the same people, you can be damn sure the owners talk to each other. this is big business, if they did the math and the math says they will make more money by spamming the network and increasing the average network fee (while double dipping and using that as a reason to push their own shitcoin) they WILL do it.
if you look at this chart:
youll see that the the bitcoin fee per block have risen to 7 bitcoin.
thats 7 extra bitcoins going to the miners every 10 minutes... thats 16 million worth of bitcoin every day going directly to the miners, do you really think a spam campaign run by bitmain would cost more then 16 million a day?


yes and people adjust their txfee according to the mempool, heck some wallets do it automatically with the recommended fee. the mempool does not exists in a vacuum.

@_date: 2017-12-21 17:57:16
wut? the mental leaps your making... all tx fees go to the miners. they are not one entity and i didnt say that, but all txfees still go to the miners
let me make it really simple.
for example lets say: bitmain controls 30% of the hashrate. so they get a 1/3rd of their txfees for free. this means they can spam the network at a cheaper price compared to anyone else. if they collude with other mining pools its even cheaper.
so if 30% of blocks are mined by them and a spam attack increase the total amount of money paid to all miners by 16mil per day they get 30% of that, so far so good?
so if the cost of the spam attack is lower the 30% of 16mil they WILL do it because it will make them money at zero risk. 
if 2 or 3 mining pools colluded to do this (which they dont have to) they could get a massive cost reduction on the spamming, making it very cheap for them to drive up the average price for a transaction


you simply start filling from the bottom. you dont need a million transactions. you just have to move the market up by blocking the lower sat amounts by making a bunch of low fee transactions constantly, the market takes care of the rest. this ofcourse only works if you keep at it and basically actively manipulate the mempool to your liking. which is again only possibly to do cheaply if you control a big % of the hashrate

to be fair: i logged in two days ago to sell my bitcoin gold, and it was immediatly clear that i couldnt deposit or withdraw without adding my idntity first. infact they wouldnt even let me generate a btg deposit adress.
still a shit company with shit practices, would not recommend to anyone. in the end i just used changelly to get rid of the btg and made an easy $1500 free money

my ledger nano s made it very easy for me. the provided a easy to use split tool.
it really depends where your coin were during the split. if they were on an exchange you just have to wait for the exchange to give them to you. if you actually owned the privatekey during the fork youll have to carefully split the btg without exposing your private key.
just google "how to split bitcoin gold your-wallet-here" or something like that.
be careful, double check everything, dont install shady software, find some reputable guide and follow it carefully (after verifying its good and legit)

its not cool. there are dozens of dozens of gpu mineable coins. there is absolutley no reason a shitty fork of bitcoin with a pow switch should have any value. all they did was make a airdrop coins and slap the name bitcoin on it. 
at this point its "just another equihash" coin... my gpus are mostly mining zcash ethereum or monero.... but sometimes they mine some random shitcoins with the same algos, so sometimes even i am mining btg, but that doesnt make it a good coin.
infact when it comes to forkcoins id actually go so far as to say they are some of the more easily identifiable shitcoins. with other projects your never sure. here you know exactly what you are dealing with: "switch the pow to equihash and call it bitcoin gold" genius
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:01:35
actuallly... it IS coinbases fault... any exchange that charges you a withdraw fee is ripping you off.
use bitstamp, they dont fuck you over and then point the finger at the network fee. no they properly batch their transactions and can offer free withdraw because of that... oh and theyve also supported segwit since september
yes txfees are currently high, but when it comes to withdrawing funds from an exchange there is really no excuse to pass on that cost to the customer (except yknow greed or incomeptence)

since your downloading the blockchain from other nodes shouldnt adding nodes (upload bandwidth) to the network increase the performance of the network for downloading the blocks? shouldnt it work kinda like a torrent swarm in that regard, where the more you add the faster it gets?
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:18:17


yes, youd have to do it carefully. first mix it, send it back and forth a couple dozen times or something, and then quickly try converting a small amount with a anon service like shapshift or changelly. they probably wont follow the chain far back enough, if it works do another small amount, and keep repeating that until you have all you money in monero.
after that its easy.
but yes to answer your question: exchanges def have a list of "blacklisted" coins that they know came from illegal activity... and if someone deposits those well there probably not gonna just let em cash out
if you want a real world example look into how the wanncry hackers cashed out. not sure on the details, but in the end i think they simply bought monero on shapeshift

step 0: be jihan and roger
step 1: spam transactions until blocks are full and mempool grows
step 2: astroturf on reddit about blocksize increase and scaling
step 3: create bcash
step 4: astroturf harder on reddit this time about high txfees
step 4.5: ignore segwit to keep blocks fuller (otherwise the spam campaign would cost more)
step 5: get noobs to drink the coolaid and join in your astroturf campaign outta pure fomo
step 6: sell some bitcoin while pumping bcash to make it look like bcash is taking off causing even more fomo from noobs that dont know any better (this is where we are now)
step 7: use manipulated market to stop bcash from crashing hard (coinbase: cant sell but weird super high price)
step 8: dump bcash on noobs, stop spamming the network, pump gains back into bitcoin propelling it to new ATH
step 9: enjoy new ATH profits from your massive mining farm
step 9.5: laugh at all the bcash bag holders you created and watch bcash slowly die
step 10: rinse repeat

Longterm their incentives allign with bitcoin, cause if bitcoin fails all their asics become worthless. So they have to decide between shortterm profit and longterm potential to hurt themselves. Currently they are very short sighted, but eventually they should realize that theyll make more money promoting bitcoin and lettting the blocks fill naturally.

i personally do not want to support bcash with all the fuckery theyve got going on (fork coins, sha256 EDA, fake scaling, astroturfing, spamming, asic boost, bitcoin hate subreddit, centralized nodes, yadda yadda yadda) id much rather support some other altcoin i actually like, like ethereum or litecoin... heck id rather invest in something random and harmless like dogecoin. def made some money doing that... like for real whos dumb enough to actually buy these shitty bitcoin forkcoins and give us hodlers all free money? ive made thousands of dollars from suckers buying my bcash and my bitcoin gold, and soon maybe my bitcoin diamond and a couple others? well see... but i really wonder who these people are that actually drank jihans coolaid, are there really that many easily fooled noobs in the space now?... but here you are. live and well possibly making money speculating on bcash like its any old alt... sure i guess you could do that, but something about the project just really rubs me the wrong way and i just want nothing to do with it. so i dump that shit like any other shitty airdrop coins i may get and speculate on the other 1500 cryptos out there

no thats two steps, you sold something, you get usd... now you are spending usd.
the instant nature of the debit card is the difference to me. there is only one step, even though its getting converted, as a customer i dont see that part, so i dont care about it.
selling my magic cards is hard and labor intensive (illuquid) which makes them not currency, but if i could send my magic cards to a company and instantly cash out their current value with a magiccard debit card then yes id consider that as "spending magic cards"
were really splitting hairs here. i had bitcoin, i spent them, now i have graphics cards, its as simple as that. just because i chose to use a 3rd party doesnt change the fact that is spent the btc...
if in the future i can atomic swap my bitcoin to litecoin and i buy somthing in a store and my bitcoin gets converted to litecoin instantly, would you not consider that spending bitcoin? its the same thing. the only ugly part is that the sidechain im using in this case is visa

if you do manual forwarding and the dhcp gives it a different ip it wont work hence the static ip, most modern routers will make a static lease for you when you forward tho
didnt know it supports upnp thats good to know, imo upnp is a bit to automagic for me and can sometimes lead to problems (not with core just in general) so i prefer manual forwarding
note if you wanna use upnp you have to activate it in core under settings -&gt; network
@_date: 2018-09-24 12:52:01
you port forward on your router
easiest is probably just googling the router modell and how to forward port
but in general it goes like this
figure out the ip of your router (usually 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1)
log in to the admin panel (you may have to lookup the default password, check on the bottom of the router or reset the pw if you dont know it)
find the portforwarding section (usually under wan)
forward the port 8333 to the computer that is running core
oh and you probably want to give the computer a static ip or assign one in your dhcp settings on the router

im not pretending, i just dont care.


if i wanna buy something from the EU i have to sell my local currency to buy euros to be able to purchase things from the eu... this usually happen automatically, but from where im standing euro, dollar, and bitcoin are all functionally the same to me. their just "not my nations currency"
at this point were just arguing over the definition of what "money" is... which again, is really splitting hairs.
lets just agree to disagree, cause youre never gonna convince me that bitcoin isnt money.... seeing as that ive been living off of it for the past couple month.

no i dont fucking agree that bitcoin i centralized, are you high? :P
sure the mining is kinda centralized in china, but thats true for ALL coins, its still by a large margin the most secure and decentralized crypto out there.


i didnt say it "pushes up" fees.
heres what i meant:
you establish a 10sat byte backlog, then on top of that you establish a 20 sat backlog, then on top of that you establish a 50 sat backlog and so forth as high as you can. now johnny come along and want to do a bitcoin transaction... he looks at the mempool to get an idea how much he should be paying, and at the same time thousands of other johnny do the same.... now instead of placing their transcations at 10 sat byte they place it at 100sat byte or whatever


thats the whole point. by clogging up the cheap txs, people will naturally adjust their real transactions upwards to gets confs, exactly what the miners want.
spammers dont care if their tansactions get confirmed or not, its enough for them to be sitting in the mempool, the market will always try to outbid the low transcations cause the market want confs, the miners dont give a shit

you can adjust how much interest you want to make yourself, your offer just may never be used since other people are offering to lend at lower interest
if you look at some of the other coins youll see it varies a bit from coin to coin...
right now the highest rate i can find is like 0.0036% on factom... which is still pretty bad..
and it also varies with time, at one point i noticed 2% interest on a random shitcoin... but that only last like a couple hours

bro do you even understand how bitcoin works? 
like wtf? do you not understand what **OPEN** and **PUBLIC** blockchain means?
it is **very easy** to transparently prove that you actually did send the money.
you make the payment and you get a TXHASH which you can use to prove that the payment has been made and is confirmed on the blockchain
heres a random example transaction shown on multiple blockexplorers (which you could use to prove that you sent the money)

ive bought almost all the dips... sadly i was on vacation during the 6k dip... yes the average is higher, but you dont have to sell everything all at once... i bought some at 7k and sold at 10k, rebought at 9k... the ones i bought at 11k? those i just hodl longterm 
my comment wasnt even banking on hindsight, you just buy the dips and your average will come down to below the current price as long as you keep doing it and you dont blow your load early (also it actually has to be a dip)
edit: also doing some very rough napkin math lookin at the chart i count 6-7 dips and come up with an average of around 9500 if you bought 1 btc each dip

America is kinda unique with this where they expect you to pay taxes even if made all the money in another country
Heck even if youve lived somewhere else and never stepped a foot on american soil, as long as you are a citizen they expect you to file taxes ( the first 100k are tax excempt but you still have to file)
This is ofcourse complete and utter bullshit since you already paid taxes on that money in whatever country you made it in
Ive just ignored them and so far so good, cause honestly fuck those greedy bastards, i already paid my taxes to the country i live in and its none of their god damn business how much i made cause ive never lived in america
The only way to get outta this is too give up your citizenship which ive heard costs like $2000 and has a waitlist lol

small typo on that page "Net**wro**k Capacity"
maybe add additional stats for:
number of nodes with 0 channels
number of nodes with 1 channel
number of nodes with 2+ channels
choose fiat currency is pretty limited and i cant pick my currency (chf) so maybe add more currency options?
change the way smallest channel displays cause i have no idea how much 1.05E-5 BTC is at a glance (using satoshis would probably be the way to go here)
the smallest node stat probably shouldnt count nodes with 0 channels
maybe add a stat for newest node / oldest nodes which links to a list with the nodes sorted by discovery date?

seeing as that you want to pay with paypal or itunes credit i strongly suspect you are trying to convert your scammed money or other illicit funds into bitcoin, but imma give you the benefit of the doubt and ignore the obviously shady part about wanting to pay with itunes credit (id love to hear a legit explanation for that)
what you linked is basically a fancy paperwallet
that means the company generates the private key, printed it on to a card and sent $25 worth of bitcoin on to it.
you are trusting them that they didn't keep the private key, so if you ever buy a premade paperwallet, be sure to empty it right away, or it just may empty itself one day (cause they kept the private key and moved your money off the card later)
buying premade paperwallet is generally not a good idea cause of this unless you 100% trsut the company selling them (since you have to empty them right away it kinda defeats the purpose)... and you should really generate your own privatekeys for the purpose of making paperwallets, otherwise you never REALLY know who else may have it
but i guess for the purpose of just converting illicit funds into bitcoin you don't really care about having to empty them right away... and i'd love to be wrong but i just can't think of a single scenario where you need to pay with paypal or itunes and its not some incredibly shady shit (aka scam money or something) but i'm all ears: why do you want to buy bitcoin giftcards (aka preloaded paperwallets) with paypal or itunes credit?

download bitcoin core from bitcoin.org or from github
install it, wait for it to sync (this could take a while and will use around 200gb of hdd space)
optional: forward port 8333 so other people can connect with your node and get blocks from it
install lnd, c-lightning or eclair (not sure which have mac version available)
transfer a small amount of bitcoin into your lightning wallet adress (&lt;$50) change your lightning node alias to something funny, open some channels and start doing some micropayment on satoshis.place 
if you get stuck somewhere just google it, youll find a answer to your problem pretty easy

option to hide pubkeys/txid and use alias only for cleaner view of channels
a nice graph showing the increase over time on the history -&gt; Changes in node capacity tab
bug: I can't click "Network stats or Choose FIAT currency", i just get the typing cursor if i hover over them instead of the hand
it would be nice to have visualizer that isn't as cluttered as the other one, with options like: hide all nodes with &gt;=&lt; X channels or &gt;=&lt; X capacity or hide all nodes that have been haven't been seen for X time
some "test my node" options would be awesome, allowing users to make a small lightning deposit and test their node on routing and receiving etc some options wouldnt even require deposit like "calculate number of channels or viable routes from our node to yours for X Sats"
also a visualizer showing the network from the view of a single node using hops would be awesome with 1 hop being direct channels etc. (or would direct channels be 0 hops... hmmm)

nigga you broke
@_date: 2019-06-05 13:56:24
that site is really really bad and not even remotely accurate
you should learn how to estimate what the current fee is instead of blindly parroting wrong information
currently the mempool pretty much always empties over night, so unless you need that transaction NOW you can just set 1sat/byte and pay 2 cents and itll be confirmed in a couple hours
here are some more accurate resources to help you estimate what the current fee is:
and AGAIN... the issue is not only are they setting the miner fee to high, they are adding an ADDITIONAL fee that has nothing to do with the miner fee

He just loves the way that boot tastes

a price listed in usd varies in its euro price by the minute... not by much, but it does... bitcoin will be no different one day... at this point its volatile and so small that you can still "feel" those fluctuation on everyday purchases (sometimes), but once its a bit bigger the variance on any given day/week/month will be so low that it only really matters if you are speculating with big amounts (aka foreign exchange markets)

they can reconsolidate outputs at 1sat/byte when it convenient, there's no excuse to add a random $1-2 fee in addition to the miner fee... its just greed
@_date: 2019-06-05 17:38:36
that is accurate as the mempool is currently rising, lots of people want priority right now
yknow whats also accurate?
To confirm within 144 blocks (24 hours)
1 satoshis/vbyte
0.02 USD
really most people are way overpaying on fees all the damn time, which leads to a domino effect on bad fee estimation algos and you end up with idiots paying dollars per tx in a block that contains 1sat/byte txs... which is just plain stupid
most of the time you do NOT need a immediate conf. you are not that important. you are not moving that much money. you can be patient. you can wait... and if you can't you gotta pay cause theres a lotta impatient people out there that want into that next block ;)
i mostly only use 2-5 sat/byte and havent had any problems at all. most payment processors mark it as paid as soon as they see it anyway.
@_date: 2019-06-05 07:02:29
not only are they way overpaying, they actually pocket the fee.

actually they recognize the payment as soon as its detected (0-conf) and accept it just fine once it confirms after a couple hours... so yes it a does work (i know this for a fact cause i have to pay bitpay invoices every once in a while and i ALWAYS lowball the minerfee)

basically a scam. you go to checkout on a $10 bill, pick bitpay and suddenly the bill is $11? (nothing to do with miner fee, thats on top of that) where did that extra dollar come from? where does it go?

If I can move the funds on the card using your app that is clearly not true. the only way to extract the coins is by having the private key...
your gonna have to get way more technical and open about how this works or your product is dead on arrival
so the it's like an opendime, except there's no physical seal to unseal the private key... so how do i extract the coins from the card (aka sign a TX with the key or just get the key so i can swipe) -&gt; tangem app... so the only way to use your product is with your app... and its it is capable of extracting the private key to then sign a transaction on your phone? so the secret sauce is in the app and what your selling is a paper wallet on a debitcard chip... is it possible to write my own app to load/unload the card? im guessing no... so your security just that you hope nobody is gonna figure out the secret sauce thats in your app?
imma load a bunch these, extract the private key (no physical indicator on card), pay someone with them, w8 a week and then steal all the money back... and don't give me "u can't" cause if your app can do it it's technically possible and only a matter of time until someone finds the masterkey (or whatever) in your app thats needed to extract the key without moving the coins.
the product you are trying to build basically already exists in a less shitty form, it's called an opendime (or a fucking paperwallet for that matter)


extraordinary claims need evidence, you can't just go "trust me bro, we totally didn't keep the key". this is why pre-generated paperwallets are generally shit on by everyone cause none of us trust you at all. like not even a little. your gonna have to prove (aka show your manufacturing standards and process in excruciating detail) that claim a lot better if you want anyone to trust it... and even then, maybe look into having the key be generated on the device by the user themselves instead of by you... cause again: i don't trust you and the idea of using a wallet that came with a pregenerated key send shivers down my spine

nah, i literally just explained it and you still don't understand. dont take the retard bit to seriously :P
it is NOT unlikely, its is bound to happen
good thing the blockchain is public and you can go check yourself how often we got blocks with only 5 minutes apart, go check yourself
increasing hashrate would make the average lower until the next retarget, but getting 5 minute blocks is just a statistical fluke, and since we do this shit every 10 minutes forever and ever its happens a LOT ;)
also i dont know where we're getting this from cause i cant find any 5 block period with only 5 minutes between blocks in the past week (set smoothing to none):

look at how opendime does it
key generation on device, bearer asset
has it drawbacks (no backup) but basically turns it into hard cash
edit: didnt really look at your product exactly, but on seconds glance... isn't this just a fancy paperwallet with a predefined privatekey generated by a third party (you)... your gonna have a hard time getting anyone to trust that
also integration of that into a POS system is basically impossible, cause you either your trust the POS system with you priv key (bad idea) or you sign the TX on your own device (which is kinda hard when it's just a piece of plastic)

bitch are you retarded?
10 minutes is a fucking **AVERAGE**. sometimes its 1 minutes, sometimes its 20, on average its 10... but if you get lucky you can have a series of 5 minute blocks... some blocks show up mere seconds after the last... and the real world average is more like 9.5 minutes due to ever increasing hashrate... 
difficulty retarget is not instant. educate yourself before spewing shit about the hashrate you don't actually understand...

I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying "OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.

good job so far...
hmm clicking total instead of live on "largest channel" shows "16777216 btc"... i don't think thats quite right ;)
maybe add median and mean Node Capacity/Average Channel Capacity as a stat (or rly for every stat where you have a average)?
maybe add a little ? tooltip that brings up an explainer for what "base fee" and "fee rate" means on mouseover (also adding a little ? tooltip would probably be great for all of them, just so you can explain what exactly is being shown with the stat)
maybe add a little space and break them up into categories and arrange them slightly differently so it has a better overview?:
network stats:
    Number of Nodes
    
    Number of Channels
    
    Network Capacity 
node stats: 
    Largest Node
    
    Smallest Node 
    
    Average Node Capacity
    
    Average node age
    
    Largest Node By Channels
    
    AVG channels per node
channel stats:
    
    Largest Channel
    
    Smallest Channel 
    
    Average Channel Capacity
    
    Average channel age
    
    Median base fee
    
    Median fee rate 
one stat id also like to see is uptime/downtime for indivdual nodes... that way you can check which nodes are reliable and always online and which are flaky and often down...
also the title of each stat should lead to a page with a list of nodes ranked by that stat (so clicking on "Largest Node By Channels" should lead to a page where all nodes are listed from most channels to least)

people do not want to reinvest their shitcoins into contentcreators, they wanna get paid for the ads they watched. and you cannot cashout the coins you earned (which btw that feature sure is taking its sweet time to get rolled out hmm?) without KYC... at which point we're back to adsense
and yes users ARE expected to do KYC if they ever wanna yknow ACTUALLY receive their bat... 


lol what? like... i can't even.
if you can game the system at all, you can scale it up and make it automated...
like how exactly is "needing a running browser instance" gonna stop a motivated attacker...  do you really think nobody is gonna figure a way out to cheat and automate watching ads? really?
the reason they have KYC for cashout is because they don't have a solution to people cheating, so they put the KYC bandaid on it as if thats gonna stop people from commiting fraud (it makes it slightly harder, but for a motivated attacker its just another hurdle)


lol?? anything done client side is very abusable and cannot be trusted (ever play an mmo with client side validation? lol cheating everywhere)... if ad matching is done locally imma just tell my custom modified bat browser to only show me the ads that pay $x or more or whatever... in the end it will still be the server that serves up the ads cause you simply cannot trust the client.


i dont trust them as far as i can throw them. if you arent paying for it you are the product. did you pay for the brave browser? are they a charity? no and no? so YOU are the product they are selling to advertisers... and if you really think adverstisers wanna advertise to a faceless ageless mob of bots/cheaters with no way to target their ads... well i got a bridge to sell you...

sending from an exchange is bad as they delay their sends, so you may end up waiting for the transaction to show up
which is what happened here, you sent money from coinbase, but because of the delay on their side, the waiter didnt see anything leading you to pay twice

Brave is bullshit. You were sold bullshit.
Nobody wants to get paid cents to watch ads, so its exactly the same as just running adblock
If its possible to watch ads for cents it will be botted to hell and back, making any profits to be had go away very quick
To avoid their system being abused the only way you can actually cash out bat is by going through full KYC which means the whole thing is fully centralized and you could do the payout with fiat or paypal or whatever and it would be exactly the same (aka adsense). There is zero reason for the token.
If i'm not mistaken they replace ads from websites with their own, which steals revenue from the website and gives it to bat.

if you send bitcoin directly from coinbase (an account directly tied to your identity) to a known darknetmarket adress (a place to buy illegal drugs) you are an idiot and you deserve to have your account locked. full stop. also thats a coinbase problem not a bitcoin problem imo
even just moving the bitcoin to your personal wallet first is enough for them to not care.
even when it comes to depositing they only look back a couple hops, so if you use your brain its really easy to just move the bitcoin back and forth a couple times and then deposit your drug money no problem... (dont do this, tumble them and wash them using monero first if you are actually dealing with highly illegal shit. be paranoid and do more then necessary)
best practice is to never reuse adresses for a reason

getting paid for watching ads isnt even live yet... 
the whole thing is dependant on KYC, which to me just screams: "sooo.. where's the difference compared to adsense?"
it's literally the same:
companies pay 3rd party money to show ads to users (google/bat)
3rd party (bat/google) pays KYC'ed customers according to how many views/clicks they generate
users get bombarded with ads so they install ad block... and no giving him a cent for each ad he views won't make him turn off adblock (also: bots, so many bots farming those ads)
they promised to fix the multi-billion-dollar ad-fraud industry: how exactly? its literally exactly the same as google adsense (heck its probably even easier to game) the only difference is that adsense pays you in dollars and bat pays you in shitcoins

so your employer pays you in bitcoin.
chances are they know nothing about it. but lets assume they do.
and now their watching your adress (for some odd reason) and see you spending your bitcoin left and right to various adresses.
how exactly are they gonna know what those adresses are?
you send $20 in bitcoin to an adress, is it:
a.) a dildo store
b.) a grocery store
c.) a drug deal
d.) your friend that you owe $20
how would they possibly know what adress is what service and why do they care?

i got it lnd/zap running on mainnet on windows 10
i managed to compile eclair for mainnet on windows 10 but i cant open any channels with it
with lnd i can buy articles from mainnet.yalls.org, but i cannot buy the sticker from the blockstream store, i get an error "feeinsufficient". its some bug that makes lnd and c-lighning incompatible at the moment
if you want to actually buy the sticker i think you have to use c-lightning on linux
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:44:28
yup port not forwarded
you gotta go into your router settign and forward port 9735 to your node so other people can connect with it
just google portforwarding "your router model"
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:50:40
im playing around with it myself right now.
my advice: wait a couple weeks if not months to use it for production
right now there are bugs that make lnd incompatible with c-lightning
you can only really get it running on linux (i managed to get lnd/zap running on windows, but i would never ever ever use this for production)
eclair just doesnt work at all on mainnet for me (probably missed something they put in there just to stop mainnet usage)
using it to test and buy some stickers is fine. were all reckless after all... but using it for actually receiving money in a productive enviroment NONONONO dont do it. trust me, wait a couple weeks
just go on github and look how many open issues there currently are.
if you really really want to do this. try buying a mainnet.yalls.org article first and then move on to buying stickers from 
only once youve managed to do that and you know what the hell you are doing should you even consider it

if most of the market think something is garbage (aka a shitcoin) then that asset will lose value over time as the market rejects it.
in the case of dash we have situation where theyve centralized the creation of money to a very small minority (themselves) and put up a huge barrier for entry (its costs 200k+ to run a masternode)... do you really think thats the kind of monetary system people will want to live in longterm? i dont, so i think it will go down, so im shorting it, simple as that.

I setup a node to play around with lightning, send people 2 cents instantly, buy somthing and have the payment take less then a second. i'm beta testing and i'm having fun, i'm not doing this to try and make money, i'm doing this to get a feel for this new technology and help it grow

according to that source bitcoin mining uses 48 TWh today... this is way over estimated
watch this part of the my source where they explain exactly how they calculate their estimates:
a couple minutes later on this slide here you can see the lower and upper estimates for jan 11 2018:
low estimate 14 TWh, high estimate 27 TWh
the low estimate being mostly high efficiency miners and the high estimate being mostly older miners with worse efficiancy
their best guess is 18 TWh
i believe you when you say the NYT fact checks things carefully, but the problem with msm bitcoin news is that nobody in msm fucking knows anything about bitcoin so its really hard to fact check for them. they cant simply go ask their experts and their usual sources since they dont really know any better whats going on then I do (probably worse). theyd need to consult with crypto experts ( in this case miners ) to actually get some real answers but there are currently very few of those.
the msm also loves to extrapolate which doesnt really make sense since mining chips keep gettin better (and a dozen other reasons)

this is where you have fundemental misunderstanding of how adresses work on bitcoin
they have one adress, evertime you send or receive your wallet generates a NEW adress.
for most services they will generate a unique one time use adress to send them money 
none of these adresses are tied to your name or the service in any way.
so lets walk through it:
1.) you buy bitcoin on coinbase. these bitcoin are assosciated with your identity.
2.) you then transfer them out to adress A. these bitcoin are still kinda assosciated with your identity (but you couldve also withdrawn to your friends or your landlords adress for example)
3.) from here you make a bunch of transactions to adresses B, C, D, and E. none of these transactions or adresses are directly tied to your identity anymore. you could be sending money to yourself, to your drug dealer, to your friend or to the coffeshop, the transactions and adresses all look the same. there is no way to tell who controls these adresses.
trying to figure out who exactly controls which adresses is really really hard since you can literally create a new adress for each time you want to receive money (which a lot of services do)
your employer has neither the interest or the capability to do this. the work required to even attempt this would be immense and the gain, well, non existant.
this is some NSA level shit we are talking about here, your employer is not capable of even attempting this. nor do they care.
but what if you want to convert your bitcoin back to USD at some point:
4a.) you send the bitcoin from adress D back to coinbase, they now know that you were in control of adress D all along. 
4b.) you send the bitcoin from adress D to adress F (optional: and from there to a bitcoin mixer), you then sell it to your friend or some random person for cash. nobody knows shit and they now have anon bitcoin you have cold hard cash. last time you where in "possesion" of those bitcoin was 3 hops ago, when they come asking where you sent them (adress D), which they wont, you just go "i dunno, ive done hundreds/thousands of transactions i cant fucking remember what each transaction was)
4c.) if you are truly paranoid and want to be 100% sure: you send the bitcoin from adress D to adress F and from there to a bitcoin tumbler, and then use that bitcoin to buy monero on shapeshift over tor sitting on a public wifi, then send monero from adress A to adress B and then to C, then change your Tor IP and convert the monero back to bitcoin using shapeshift again. you now have truly completely anon bitcoin that you can use to buy drugs of the darknet or whatever (this is way overkill and you can probably ignore half these steps, but you get the point)

im actually already running a couple ubuntu VMs... but this is the exact situation id like to avoid since im already running a fullnode on the windows hostsystem and id like to leave my lightning node up and running 24/7 so it can route payments...
id have to shutdown the fullnode running on the hostsystem and then spin up a new fullnode in the linux vm and sync from scratch...
also i kinda just like the challenge of trying to get it working on windows, since that is what i use 90%+ of the time...
you are probably right... i should just give up and do it on linux, but at this point im really curious if anyone has actually gotten it to work on windows... also the lnd &lt;-&gt; c-lightning problem should also affect linux... but on linux i could just run c-lightning i guess

Any options for windows gui plebs like me?
When i last checked like two weeks ago mainnet was pretty much linux and cli only, has that changed yet?
I even spun up a full node so i could run lighning on mainnet on top of that, but then realized that a windows full node doesnt really get me any further
Fullnode still chugging along waiting for dat lightning to strike
Is there currently any way to run lightning on mainnet on windows with a gui without having to change any code myself? ( Im ok with alpha, im not ok with changing shit myself)
Testnet is for pussies. Im done buying fake coffee with fake coins. I need some real stickers with real coins

If you are just using lightning to buy some stuff to test it nobody can "steal" your bitcoin
When you open a channel all the fund are in yout favor, nobody can steal them by by rebroacasting an old state cause theres no old state with funds not in your favor. Its only when you are receiving payments that you need to worry about "stealing" and even then its a highly technical attack with a big risk for the attacker... And the only funds they can steal are the ones they themselves sent you
You also really dont have to commit your btc, you can just open a channel with like $100 and lea e everything else in cold storage, you can then use that channel as many times as you want

i also couldnt do it with 0.4, but now with 0.4.1 it works perfectly
i did two purchases, 1 directly connected to the blockstream node (sleepyark) and one routed over a different node (coinpanic.com)
you have to make sure there is enough btc in the channel you are trying to use.
id suggest testing with just a single sticker first to eliminate all errors that may be because of to little capacity
the coinpanic.com node has a channel with 1000000 sats so any payments under $75 should work fine if you have a channel open with them (of course the channel you open must also be large enough)
with lnd 0.4.1 it should route around faulty nodes now
what error exactly are you getting when you try to pay the invoice? what nodes do you have channels open with? how large are your channels?

ok stop... lets be fucking real here.
the bandaid solution "segwit2x" wouldve ***literally*** killed the network.
it was **broken** and did not work and never propagated another block.
going to 2 MB was never the problem. pretty much everybody agrees that if we need too, we can always still do that...
the problem was not what, but **HOW** and **WHEN** they wanted to do it:
yes, us 5 businessmen agree, lets just do this bandaid fix and activate it in a couple weeks easy peasy... no that not how it fucking works...
first off you cant just decide in a closed meeting to "compromise" with yourself and then expect everyone to just blindly follow and you cant write test and roll out a change like that in a couple weeks
they tried blocking segwit, when that didnt work cause of the uasf, they tried to save face and subvert the normal way opensource software gets created to push through a really dumb "compromise" (which again wouldve KILLED THE NETWORK) and failed.
during all of this somehow the abomination bcash was born (with an EDA that was broken on purpose so the miners could game the diff down and then continue to use their asicboost miners on the bcash side)
@_date: 2018-04-01 20:37:43


NO... just fuckin NO!
when you are dealing with a multiple billion dollar decentralized cryptocurrency you dont do "bandaid solutions"
the only reason bitcoin has survived until today is because it has refused to compromise, no quick fixes, no bandaids, no uneccessary features that just add complexity and break shit. you do it right and you test it very carefully or you dont do it at all.
yes, sometimes in some software project, move fast and break shit and bandaids solutions works out fine... but when it comes to my money i DO NOT want anything less then the best possible solution and i want that shit to be tested to a degree that would seem like overkill to most people

no thats not how it works.
if you have a lightning node with any open channels you can receive tips, you do not need an open channel with the tipbots node
i could post a lightning invoice in this comment and you could pay it without knowing which node i am or what channel are being used to route the payment

So if your buying obly 100 worth the fee works out to be quiet a bit more then 6%

hmm i remember it as 6% + 5chf or something like that, but i could be misremembering... i just remember doing the math and figuring out that on low amounts the flat fee fucks you over resulting in like 15-20% and on high amount the 6% fee fucks you

While yes in this case it probably is the point is that you arent in control and all you can do at this point is pray its fine... And sometimes it wont be fine and your coins will be gone... So dont be a lazy dumbass and leave your coins on an exchange and you wont have to worry at all...

not your keys, not your coins. bitcoin wallet as a service is a stupid idea and you should not be using that website... ive been doing this shit for years and ive never even heard of block.io, which is NOT a good sign.
get an ACTUAL wallet you control, then you are in full control of the fees and actually know when and why your transaction will/wont confirm...

The diff adjusting is the mechanism to make it every 10 minutes
Not enough hashrate for a block every 10 mins? Diff adjusts down
Too much hashrate for a block every 10 mins? Diff goes up
When the price goes down so far old hardware isnt profitable to mine with miners turn off that old hardware, which causes the hashrate to drop, so now theres not "enough" hashrate so the diff adjusts down... Thats whats happening now... Usually diff only ever goes up as new hw is added to the network, but when a whole generation of asics miners arent worth running anymore, hashrate goes down as people pull them offline and the diff reacts to that
Slower in this case just means that while people are pulling old hw offline but BEFORE the diff adjusts down it will take slightly longer then 10 mins on average. As soon as the diff adjusts its back to 10 mins
You could argue its never really 10 mins since thats only accurate exactly after the adjustment and the rest of the diff period the hashrate is varying wildly... But its only a average... Also the average is actually like 9.5 minutes in practice since hw is constantly being added to the network (at least up until recently(
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:13:16
hashrate follows price... so when the price goes up like last winter miners speculate and bring a lot of new harware online but this takes time
now that the price is going down what you are seeing is the older asic models or miners with high power cost being turned off and diff adjusting down which makes it more profitable for all the remaining miners

I only make 1sat/byte transactions as im fine with waiting, but you dont see me complaining it takes hours cause i know thats the aporopriate time if im only paying 1 sat/byte

If you don't have very cheap electricity i wouldndt bother with the asic. as for a full node and lightning node: very cheap

the answer is: it depends on the amount of money being sent and your risk tolerance
6 is generally accreted to be enough for large amounts so you can be 100% sure its irreversible... for smaller amounts less confs would be ok, but in the end the exchange really doesnt want to carry ANY risk so they will always tend to go with the safe side and want to many confs instead of not enough

You also dont need a routing node to just to make payments
Fuck visa and mastercard the whole point is to get away from their greedy bloodsucking asses
@_date: 2019-05-23 08:50:56


which is a good thing... you do not need to save every $2 candy purchase on the blockchain forever. the channels can be reused for low cost transactions and when you feel like it you can always close the channel and get you coins back onchain (at which point its back on the blockchain)... but you don't really have to and the whole point is to move certain low value transaction offchain... transactions are private between lightning nodes but you can still verify everything trustlessly (which is the point of the blockchain)
if you really want to understand how it work i suggest you watch some videos as you seem pretty confused tbh ;)

If you learn the origin of why the term bcash really stuck, you learn how and why bcash is a scam
Call it whatever, but i'll forever love the term for how petty and unstable it showed roger to be in that moment of rage over a perceived slight 
It was another nail in the scam coffin and i think its nice we try to remember our "crypto history"
