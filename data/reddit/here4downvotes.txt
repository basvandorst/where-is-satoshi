That's because it's not a killer app. However it has its place and opens the door to more innovation in micropayments.


And get hit by both ChangeTip's 1% fee *and* Paypal fees? No thanks. You can only create so many transactions sent as a gift before PayPal adjusts accordingly. Also, it's pretty hard if not impossible to get a PayPal account in some parts of the world.

Yes you can. 


No it's not. The idea is to take advantage of other features such as more rich scripting languages, faster confirmations, different fee schedules, etc. without the risk of adopting native tokens of another platform. If the second chain agrees to the rules of the Bitcoin blockchain, the coins adopt the rules of that sidechain when they are sent to it, and they adopt the rules of the Bitcoin blockchain if/when they are sent back.
This is exactly what happens when you send coins to platforms like Coinbase or Circle, except sidechains are decentralized and have a "ledger" just like the Bitcoin blockchain.

Buy-and-hold != value investing. For example, buying growth stocks for the dividends they produce -- that's a buy-and-hold methodology that is not the same thing as value investing. Value investing is finding net present value based on metrics such as free cash flow, % of shares held by management, frequency of share buybacks and acquisitions of other businesses, etc. It is very difficult to perform a valuation of Bitcoin because there are many variables and a lot of unknowns in the space. When we buy Bitcoin we are speculating. There's nothing wrong with that, but let's call a spade a spade here.

You don't have to purchase anything on BitReserve -- hopefully it's obvious why this isn't relevant.

This is a less likely scenario than bitcoin succeeding in some way because bitcoin has real use in B2B applications and in unbanked economies where there are problems with instability and lack of financial products. Banks won't provide B2B payment platforms for the same rate as bitcoin because it isn't profitable to do so. It's quite likely that small portions of the population in countries like Argentina, Venezuela, African nations that don't utilize MPesa, etc. adopt bitcoin -- I'm talking like 1% or less of the population in each country. By 2020 almost everyone will have a smartphone and it'll only take a fraction of a percent of that population using bitcoin to provide enough liquidity to make B2B use prudent.

That is not why stocks have value. Some of the most valuable publicly traded companies have rarely or never paid a dividend.

It's still too early to trust any sort of third party storage. If you don't want to be ripped off then don't put your bitcoin in any sort of account where you don't hold possession of the private keys. If you don't hold the private keys, you don't own the coins. The interest you might earn from storing in a third party isn't going to generate enough of a return to justify the risk -- you'll probably get better risk-adjusted returns just holding the coins yourself.

Speculation on can, and in many cases does, involve a buy-and-hold strategy. Bitcoin is an example of this.
Evidently your headache doesn't bother you very much, otherwise you would not have made so many posts defending your position.

"Drugs and terrorism" what? To show you how ridiculous this is, consider drugs themselves. Many are illegal -- has the legality of these substances prevented distribution and use? Many illegal drugs are "mainstream" in terms of user population. Killing mainstream adoption is trivially easy indeed, but "drugs and terrorism" is certainly not the way it'd be done.

Early adopters don't build out the network, developers do. Most developers are funded by investors or are seeking funding from investors. A rising price puts pressure on developers to ship faster.


Price and volatility are not related. Volume (liquidity)and volatility are related. One of the reasons the price doesn't matter is because there are so few users in the space and the market is extremely illiquid. There are going to be many swings, likely for years to come.


Price != value. Bitcoin isn't a good store of value at this point for most people, anyhow -- far too new and too few people in countries that could *really* benefit from Bitcoin are even aware it exists right now, much less understand &amp; trust it and have the technology available to use it regularly. Maybe in a few years.

Selling cryptocurrency on eBay is a great way to get scammed and/or get your Paypal account locked. eBay and Paypal accounts are hacked constantly to purchase Bitcoin; when the rightful account owner reports the theft and Paypal returns the funds from your account to theirs, the Bitcoin has already been sent to the thief. Additionally, if you read Paypal's terms and policies you'll find that the sale of cryptocurrency is forbidden, and when - not if - they find out your account will be locked. To get it back you'll need to send them a signed and notarized document stating you acknowledge this and will discontinue your breach of TOS.
Mining on a desktop is very hard on the machine and uses quite a bit of electricity, so your returns are likely to be a fraction of what electricity and computer repair/replacement will cost.

Just because they haven't ripped anyone off yet doesn't mean giving them your private keys is a good idea. And even if they are 100% honest there's still nonzero risk of the cold storage being stolen, the cold storage drive failing, intervention by regulatory agencies, etc.


If in the long run there are regulatory hoops, etc. it can certainly be more profitable to take the funds and run. Pretty easy to create a honeypot in the BTC space, too.

The name Bitcoin is something of a misnomer because the coin is just a small part of the whole. Bitcoin is a digital financial ledger. One aspect of the ledger includes a digital currency, which is the focus of the masses. Bitcoin can be programmed to do anything from peer-to-peer payments to executing a will upon your death to impounding a car when a debtor is delinquent on payments. In time all of this will make more sense to the layman.

I own a business that sells and installs widgets. My widget supplier accepts bitcoin and offers a 2% discount if I pay with it. My average invoice is over $1000 and I make two or three purchases weekly. If I want to pay with bitcoin I'll need at accept the currency risk associated with buying and holding since the largest instant purchase I can make on Coinbase is $1000 per week. The risk is greater than the discount, so it's not worth it for me to buy widgets with bitcoin.
I'm not sure if BitReserve is *the* solution to this problem but they have the right idea in this regard. The downside is reliance on third-party trust.

Since stocks don't always pay a dividend you've implied it.


Actually, you didn't. You said:


This is not a true statement. You have implied that you understand the motivations of every investor in the market, which you do not. ROI = capital gains + distributions. A company can generate capital appreciation without dividend distributions, thus dividends or anticipation of dividends are not prerequisites for investment.
To further prove this point, consider Berkshire Hathaway. One ten cent dividend was distributed in 1967. Since then the stock has appreciated over 650,000% with zero distributions and zero intent to distribute in the future. Why do you think investors bought shares of Berkshire Hathaway? 
Perhaps *you* should read more, maybe [this shareholder letter from Warren Buffett]( or any number of books that cover CEOs such as Katharine Graham, Henry Singleton, John Malone, et al. who either paid very few or zero dividends throughout their tenure yet produced the highest compounded returns we've ever seen.

Now (in the future) without 4% Paypal fees and reduced auction fees because trustless, concensus-based escrow equates to less work and expense for the auction house. Now (in the future) with faster transaction processing time since computers and mathematical models determine legitimacy of buyer/seller transactions, not the fraud department operated by humans who need sleep and time away from the office. Now (in the future) with a more broad market for products and services because almost everyone will have a smartphone and international shipping will become easier and less expensive.

Even with the right ingredients, if you're deep on the waiting list for new equipment your ROI will suffer as your competitors already have the equipment and are increasing the difficulty; they'll have made enough to begin preparing to invest in the next round of mining technology by the time you've received your order.
