I was hoping the users knew his music lol.  He did a country song about buying weed.  Get that money, buy my medicine were the real lyrics.  Quite a catchy song!

I think the argument is like this.  Bitcoin is a commodity and a currency.  If it blows up it will be mainstream and most things mainstream will be used by the majority of vendors.  We already have evidence of everything being bought under the sun with bitcoin from property to drugs.  Any whale or early investor will simply keep their coin and use it as daily currency.  They wont have to sell out because their goal is already achieved.

Btc-e is definitely my favorite even if it has only a few coins to choose from.  It is much faster than those mentioned.
