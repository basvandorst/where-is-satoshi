someone watching someone else log in to a website is hardly proof of billions of USD in reserves.  Heck scammers knock up really convincing looking bank websites all the time.
The one and only way that Tether gets to prove itself is get ... an... audit... done. Get a 3rd party company who has a legal liability for false audits to confirm that the money is in place.
This kind of audit is the bread and butter of loads of companies and if Bitfinex/tether have anything like the funds they claim they do, they'd have auditing companies lining up to take the fees.
The fact that they can't get any auditing company to take them on as a client, whilst not proof of wrongdoing, isn't exactly confidence inspiring.

The whole point of Tether is that it's tied to the Fiat system controlled by governments, that's literally it's reason to exist, to be a bridge between crypto and fiat.
So yeah they're going to need to play the rules of the game on both sides to maintain that.
Pure crypto coins, nope they can do whatever they want, stay away from the fiat, gov centralised world.  Tether can't.

If a bank gets robbed, you don't lose money in most cases. 
Cool... for covering the loss.  That should be table stakes. If you promise to house someone's money securely and you fail to do that, you should be liable for the loss.
"traditional" banks are audited and regulated to ensure that they have security in place and can re-imburse customers for losses.  If these exchanges are going to act like banks, sounds like they need the same.
