Can **I Be FREE t**o contribute great new tools or apps, more than in earlier times on bitcointalk? When I get 1000 BTC, then yes I can. And then I will deliver.

Well, this is not "cheap talk", like many other proposals that have been sketched with little thought or care to the details.
You are right that no code is there yet, but detailed spec is there, which is a very good prerequisite to write code based on that.
Any proposal should first be discussed about its principles, before writing code, this is also the guideline of BIP process and makes absolutely sense. First a proposal has to be understood from system point of view. For that code does not necessarily help. What helps much more is a description that a human can understand to grasp the idea, plus possibly simulation code and simulation results with illustrations, again with the purpose to allow human to understand the idea. All of that is available here.
And considering "time is running" or "clock is ticking": This proposal proposes BIP102 (raise limit to 2 MB) as intermediate step to gain time, so there is no need for hurry.

You might be interested in this:
It combines the ideas of this proposal with  a long-term limit similar to bip101 and a voting component similar to (but better than) bip100.

Don't confuse this proposal with BIP100 - it is *very* different in terms of abuse power of miner majorities or minorities. Maybe you find some time to read the proposal.
The phrase "This solution gives voting power to the miners" in standalone is certainly misleading and lets the alarm bells ring for those being not so amused about the pitfalls of BIP100.

And that's what is quite worrying about BIP100, as explained in the post "
This "BIP10X" makes this much more transparent, avoids the need for secret collaborations or cartels, and avoids that minorities can cause damage to the system. It still keeps some voting power to miners - enough power for miners that are honest, but not in a way that facilitates manipulation by minorities, and not in a way that it can damage the system as is possible in BIP100.
I think miner operators who do not have a hidden agenda should be perfectly fine with this proposal, even more (and in fact much more) than with BIP100, but this requires reading and understanding the proposals and playing some scenarios to understand possible consequences.
My proposal was inspired by both BIP100 and BIP101 by the way.
I encourage you to get more involved in this proposal BIP10X.

I appreciate sharing your opinion, which I do not disagree too much with. There are just some "However"s...
Different people have different opinions, and some arguments that are brought forward by some people say that BIP101 is in principle a good way forward, *but* it tries to predict the technological progress of bandwidth and storage capabilities from today on until eternity. They express the concern that this anticipated growth rate is hard-coded into BIP101, with even a little bit too much optimism, and this probably yields too high block size limits in the medium-to-long run. I tend to agree with this viewpoint (and my BIP proposes a solution to address this concern).
The BIP101 supporters usually give the correct pragmatical answer to this concern in saying that a too quick increase of block size limit in BIP101 does not actually harm, because it is just a *limit*, and not the *actual* block size.
In the beginning I also adopted this argument, but then I had to find out with some self-criticism that is is not entirely "honest": This answer is technically correct, but with this logic one could equally well abandon any block size limit altogether, arguing that also an infinite block size limit does not mean that actual block size will be infinite. So the fact that BIP101 *does* define a block size limit means that BIP101 proponents see some benefit of having such a limit in general, and I agree with that. But this self-contradicts the BIP101 proponents' earlier argument that a too high block size limit does not harm.
Note that only a small offset in prediction of technological evolution can cause huge difference between what would be a good block size limit at a future time "t0+delta" and what is the actual block size limit acc. to BIP101. For example, ...
* if actual doubling of bandwidth and storage occurs every 2.5 years (=+32% p.a.), while BIP101 predicts a 2 years doubling speed (41% p.a.), then after 10 years the BIP101's block size limit would be twice as high as it "should" be. And after 20 years the mismatch is a factor of is 3.7.
* If the actual doubling needs 3 years (+26% p.a.), the discrepancy with BIP101's limit becomes a factor of 3.1 or 9.5(!) after 10 or 20 years, respectively.
* After all, there could even be some technological breakthroughs in the future, rendering BIP101's hard-coded growth rate too conservative. In this case, the protocol would offer no solution for increasing the limits faster.
So, there should be some further intelligence brought into the protocol to avoid that the block size limit is too far away from technological reality. This intelligence can only be a feedback from either actual Bitcoin usage (block occupancy), or information inserted by human. This BIP combines both of these approaches, while the latter is the "vote".
**BIP101 proponents** should not have too little trust in miners "voting capabilities". It is likely that at least 51% of miners will vote reasonably in the long term. And(!), note that even if they don't: Thanks to this BIP's first constraint imposed by ACTUAL block size, block size limit *will* grow (before the network experiences mission critical congestion), even if miner votes are insane. So I as an originally BIP101 proponent, feel absolutely comfortable that this "BIP10X" will not disappoint original BIP101 proponents.
**BIP100 proponents** (especially many/most **mining pools** seem to sympathize with BIP100 currently) on the other hand should also be happy with this "BIP10X", because it lies in their hands to determine the general growth speed of Bitcoin, by determining block size limit evolution from a combination of actual block size and explicit voting. This way, they can even stretch the growth rate beyond "BIP101 speed" (but only with stable 80% majority), but they can also limit the growth speed. In general, the 51% idea lies behind these mechanisms, which should find more support amongst the miners than the BIP100 proposal which defines the 20% quantile as the vote that decides.
But not only can 20% minorities of miners block a needed moderate growth, they can even cause huge and fast fluctuations of block size limits over time. All this means instability and little planning security, which lies certainly NOT in the interest of the normal miner. Therefore I assume that miners, after careful study of this BIP10X and the consequences of BIP100, will be much more in favor of BIP10X.
To summarize, I think the presented "BIP10X" has the potential to find support both amongst miners, as well as amongst BIP101 supporters.
* I believe in support from miners and up-to-now-BIP100-proponents simply because there are compelling pragmatical economical reasons why miners should support BIP10X in favor of BIP100.
* I also believe in support from the "BIP101 camp", because I assume they are in support of  BIP101 not because "101" is such a nice number, but they support BIP101 because the block size evolution mechanism should have certain positive traits (properties) and should lack certain negative properties, both in the interest of Bitcoin's prosperity, and in lack of other sound BIP proposals having been published, they decided to support BIP101 as the best match.
As a final argument towards "BIP101'ers", I would like to point out an aspect in support of BIP10X that might otherwise be misunderstood: With BIP10X you do not need to be afraid that miner voting mechanism can cripple Bitcoin's usability and evolutionary growth. Because, if you carefully look how mechanisms and parameters of BIP10X are designed, you will find that this risk is practically not greater in BIP10X than in BIP101 itself! Yes, even in BIP101, "the miners" (as a hypothetical collective group) can "cripple" or "boycott" the system by simply generating rather empty blocks and letting the mem-pool grow indefinitely, while the block size limit would allow much larger blocks. Clearly the same could happen with BIP10X, but not much more than that. As soon as a substantial percentage of miners fills the blocks normally (thanks to constraint "(C-1)" about "actual block size"), the block size limit is bound to grow. So in either case, BIP101 and BIP10X, it is not easily possible to cripple the system, so robustness is quite similar in both BIPs! Hence, I expect BIP101 proponents to also be able to sympathize with this BIP10X.
To summarize, I believe that this proposal has the potential to really find **wide range support** and solve the deadlock in the current discussion.
*Disclaimer: I am a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2011 and am pursuing a normal and well-paid job in the classical non-Bitcoin industry (system design in telecommunications), plus I have a deep and purely private/scientific/non-ideological interest into macro-economics since the financial crisis of 2008. I have no political intentions whatsoever to push Bitcoin in one direction or the other, but I am just loving (and I still love) the beauty of this system. Therefore I want to do all I can to help Bitcoin grow, prosper and succeed, and this is my contribution to achieve this. Needless to say that it really cost me plenty of time.*

A default of 0.0% is just as arbitrary as a default of +30% p.a. or any other value.
If we want the default to be the best guess for preserving decentralization of Bitcoin, 0.0% is certainly not the best guess. I got inspired from some presentations of scaling Bitcoin workshop in Montreal last weekend.


There is a mechanism! Just the same symmetry for in- and de-crease as in BIP-100.
I wrote a new BIP, which I called BIP-100.5(inofficial name) here:

Unless I completely misunderstood BIP100, a minority of 21% of miners, including non-voters, can prevent that the block size limit is ever increased, or decreased. To leave the staus quo in either direction, more than 80% is required.
That's why I do not see how to justify the statement *"[BIP100] does give miners more power to increase the limit."*
But anyway, I was hoping to have a discussion here more on my proposal (called "BIP10X" for now) than a debate between BIP100 and BIP101 proponents. Let's all remember that this is not a religious question but a technical discussion, one can see pros and cons everywhere and does not have to be 100% for or against something.
Solutions evolve when discussing them. We should not decide too early for one horse or another, if there are many more horses to check. The whole discussion is still young, so let's try to stay flexible and open minded to new ideas especially if they try to integrate different viewpoints.
