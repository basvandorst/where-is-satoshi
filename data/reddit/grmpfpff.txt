why would there be an emergency hard fork? Eventually the attacker will run out of money and that's it. Talking about how 10k is nothing is easy. Do this with your own money and we talk again after you blew it up for nothing.

Funny, when you look at why the blocks are 8MB although they contain less transactions, you realise that there is 48.015 inputs and 26.412 outputs in  compared to 5.223 inputs and 6.878 outputs in Bitcoin block 
It becomes obvious even for newbies that there there is "something going on" that causes blocks to blow up to 8MB although the transaction count didn't rise.
edit: And check out the total fee in each of those 8MB blocks.

Please, bring me "back to reality" and tell me quickly .... how long is this


Please, give me some numbers, will you?

I don't know why people spam a network that has already proven in August 2017 that this kind of attack is useless. It will only motivate the network to get consensus for higher block size limits faster which will make spam attacks even more expensive.
The ones that spammed the network only wasted over 1000$ in transaction fees. Pretty dumb. But as a miner I say thank them of course for this nice tip ;)
edit: I just calculated the fees for the blocks during the spam attack. The spammer paid almost 10.000$ so far for this attack.
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:00:35
and the miners spit out 8MB blocks like its no big deal. Interesting.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:46:26
I think Satoshi was a smart guy to come up with something like Bitcoin, there is nothing religious in believing that the inventor knew what he was talking about. He didn't see SPV wallets as a problem and I trust his judgement. If you look at my history you will find enough evidence that I'm disgusted by people treating Bitcoin like a religion myself. 
I don't need to feed you with the size of my Laptop HDD. It's irrelevant. I can extend it as much as I want, either with external Drives, a NAS, little server where my miners are. There will be no shortage in space, and I'm invested enough in Bitcoin to not worry about something as trivial as disk space. Its a useless discussion, you can stop being fixated on that argument.
You believe that everything is fine on the BTC fork. I see by looking at the fees and the congestion, the businesses who stop accepting it, the decreasing market share that dropped from 90% to 30%, and the development teams who have left the ship, that it isn't. Tell yourself that everything is fine though and that I'm just having another opinion. Fine with me.
We are not getting anywhere here. If you have some links to more detailed descriptions about mining and consequences of block size limits on asic hardware, I would love to learn more to fill the gaps I obviously have. Otherwise until next time! 
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:56:07
Oh, I find it interesting enough in the here and now, I don't need to imagine hypothetical irrational futures.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:00:07
Oh, I upvoted that post. I, as a miner, cannot wait for it. I want to see what my ASICS are really capable of, sooner than later.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:38:54
You don't give any technical answer, but just spit out insults instead. But blame me for not getting deeper with you into the topic then???
1,6TB space per year when we have constant 32MB blocks. I mine and can afford it when we reach this amount in a couple of years. Especially considering the price rise when we reach that amount of adoption.
Its not the technology that limits Bitcoin, but you. This stupid discussion about disc space is irrelevant since everybody can download light wallets on their phones.
edit: You know, I get it though. You don't want to give control out of your hands. Run everything at home like when Bitcoin started. But look at the price you paid for it. And face reality. I realised that if I want Bitcoin to become really successful, I need to give up this dream that I can run the new financial revolution from my home laptop from 2009 and reach worldwide adoption at the same time. I realised that when I couldn't mine with my CPU profitable anymore.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:22:21
But I can switch to a pool that has a high block limit, and the next time that someone decides to spend thousands of Dollars to flood the mempool, I can check again how my miner is handling it.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:34:34
So what you are saying is that... it doesn't matter if I mine 1MB blocks or 32MB blocks, for my miner its all the same and no problem at all? Mmh, funny, then I vote for unlimited block size.
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:08:08
that's one funny interpretation. So if those transactions were not summoned in 1x 8MB block, but 8x 1MB blocks, it would use less blockchain space? 
There were 4x 8MB blocks created in 1 hour. That's 32MB that were confirmed. For less than 300$ fee each block. To confirm those 32MB on Bitcoin it would need more than 5 hours.
Looks like a pretty efficient way to me to get rid of a bunch of unnormal transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:49:52
I'm running a node, and I'm tracking the network traffic. Nothing to worry here on my laptop.
I'm just not a fan of all these hypothetical dramatic scenarios. Just look at how the hard fork survives although the network spits out 8MB in 10min intervalls. Due to the shills of the last 3 years this should have not been possible. 
That's why I got into mining Bitcoin myself, to see what's REALLY going on. And I see that my miners are doing fine, and my node is doing fine on my laptop as well this weekend. So excuse me if I'm not a big fan of these hypothetical warnings anymore. I just prefer to stick to reality.
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:49:19
The reason is that transactions are being send with unnormal  amounts of inputs and outputs. That's what is blowing up the block size.
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:57:51


Why don't you ask your "crystal ball"? Give me data and we can discuss it. You don't have data again? I won't discuss your imaginary end time scenarios, sorry. I won't try to convince you that there is no problem. I don't care anymore if you believe me or not, because Bitcoin has forked off already, and everything works.


Things are not fine on the 1MB hard fork. Again, maybe in your imagination, not in reality. Nothing is fine here.


Yep, I stick to what Satoshi believed. End users don't need to run nodes, they will be fine running SPV wallets. I'm aware that on the other fork there is not much education about running full nodes, but I also understand why. There will not be one node implenentation again taking control over the entire system by convincing everyone that only if you run their full node, you will keep Bitcoin decentralized.


Satoshi must have been a really dumb fella then.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:50:29
sorry, you lost me at 


That is exactly how bitcoin works. Doesn't matter which hard fork it is.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:21:00
And your insults are really all you have. Sad.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:29:22
? The strategy is to take advantage of what's technologically and practically possible to make the network invulnerable to attacks from individuals. The number of individuals that can afford a measurable spam attack on a network with 8MB blocks is already significantly lower than on a network with 1MB blocks, and 1sat/byte transactions still have a chance of being confirmed within 2 blocks. Looks pretty successful to me. But you don't need to agree. Everybody gets what he wants since the hard fork.

I've not avoided gold, it's just not traded in such small amounts, that's why i talked about silver for my 20$ example. tooth gold is traded, but traders accumulate bigger amounts to sell again. it's like... a tab System lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:04:41
? buy two cheap USB sticks for 10$, encrypt your private keys with a strong password and save them on both, and hide the sticks in different places. there you go, 2 backups of all your data for 10 bucks. Unless you wrote BITCOINS on those sticks, no one will know what you saved on them. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:55:35
buy 4, buy 6, whatever makes you happy. Statistically 2 backups of your master should be enough. Digital data can be duplicated and stored so easily nowadays, makes as many copies as you like.
edit: Ive been using this practise for my digital data for years. So forget that i wrote "shouldn't be enough". it practically is enough from my experience. My bitcoin wallet survived 6 years like this. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:53:04
So first your wallet should allow you to encrypt your private key with a passphrase or password. That is step one. Step two is to use a container like zip, 7zip or rar that can be secured with a password as well. save your private keys in that. That's the cheapest way to hide your private keys from unwanted eyes. Use strong passwords with more than 12 characters, better more than 20, to make it very difficult to hack those containers by bruteforce attack.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:31:37
Are you deliberately leaving out useful information about TenX's conversion rate that you have to accept when you buy with their card?
From their terms of service:




@_date: 2017-12-20 03:56:05
I don't know out of my head, sorry. To be honest, spend a couple of bucks more and save your wallets on as many devices as you find sufficient until you feel comfortable with your solution. Burn them on DVD-RAM which are supposed to survive for at least a decade, and send that DVD to your parents to store. Copy them on a couple of USB sticks, they cost nothing nowadays and you probably have a couple of them laying around. Use your old 16MB Sony SD-Cards that are just useless otherwise. A small zip file with a strong password won't get much attention by a thief if you give it a boring name like "taxes2009" for example.
And when you are done, delete the wallets from your computer and your phone. Only copy them back on your device when you do a transaction. And then delete again.
Plug in your sticks, DVDs once a year to check if they still work and test the zip or 7zip or rar container for errors, and that's it. Unless there is an Alien attack that use EMP guns, or your house gets flooded or burnt down, your sticks will be fine. And if you are afraid of that, send a USB stick to someone you trust.
This applies to all your sensitive data you don't want to lose by the way. Don't trust any single drive, always make more than one copy and don't store them at the same place, and you will be fine.

As I said, you are a liar. I paid 20$ yesterday evening when the Bitcoin Core 0.15 client recommended that fee and the tx is still unconfirmed after 24h. I started a thread here today on /bitcoin to get help.
BCH transactions happen within 10minutes, I sent a transaction for 0.0000029 BCH fee and it was included in the next block. That's not SLIGHTLY better, that WORLDS better.
Please tell me how  you got your 30$ tx moved within 30min, because I would REALLY like to get my transaction confirmed before the end of the year.

I just read a lot of if's and maybe's, I will stay very far from your conclusions that you cannot back up with any facts.
I just tried creating private keys in the wallet myself and the reason for the internet connection is that the wallet uses a "wallet service" that is being explained [here]( I'm sure someone will be able to explain what the advantages and disadvantages of that procedures are.

There is a customizable URL in advanced options when creating a BTC or BCH private key that connects to a ["wallet service"]( What that means exactly, I don't know.

Please use analogies that are comparable. Silver and Gold are being massively traded on ebay for years. There is traders all over the world (including friends of my family) who dedicate their entire business model around trading gold and silver online. You can sell and buy gold and silver there quick and easy.
You are talking about selling your Bitcoin on an exchange, that implies that you moved your coins from your wallet to that exchange already which you are ingoring. That costs you a descent amount of fees. Buying Bitcoins also costs you a massive amount of fees when you transfer them from the exchange to your wallet.
You can sell a silver necklace that weights a few grams and has 20$ worth of silver to anyone anytime and you can have cash in your hand in an instant. You can even chose between 2 prices: The value of the silver alone or the value of the silver plus the value of the artistry. You cannot move and sell bitcoins worth 20$ from your wallet to anyone today without losing most of your 20$ to fees.
Funny thing with Bitcoin is: You pay fees to take your coins home. With Silver and Gold you only pay fees to store it somewhere outside your home :P Taking them to the store or home is free.

Hey, little update, my tx went through last night after 6 days. I played around with the -walletbroadcast=0 option but couldn't get my transaction to be sent again. The core wallet crashed half of the time while starting up, the transaction was nullified but my balance was still 0, or I sent the new transaction to late and it didn't work out. I also noticed that if I load in an old backup of my wallet, all my transactions will be gone but my balance is still zero.
Anyways, tx got through, converted my btc on the exchange and don't need the btc full node anymore now. This is the first day since 2012 that I don't own any BTC anymore. Weird. Thanks for your help and Merry christmas!

I would like direct answers to my question that I asked in this thread. I cannot find them anywhere, I only find complicated introductions into the Lightning Network that use a lot of complicated words to describe something that seems to be an exchange platform. So if it is an exchange platform, who will make money with it? Now exchange platforms make money with exchanging coins for us. Who will make money when the LN acts as an exchange platform?
edit: And even if you reduce your answer to transfers from Alan to Bob transferring Bitcoins. It all starts with a transaction into the LN. Who dictates the price for that tx?

Thank you for your answer, but you are not answering any of my questions directly I'm afraid. Let me try to figure out what you are saying, and please correct me where I'm wrong.


So thats like running a Bitcoin node I understand. So instead of going to the internet site of an exchange platform, I open the program and I am part of the exchange platform myself. Correct?


A "user channel" contains a "Hashed Time-Locked Contract", correct? So what you are saying is, I can decide if I let people use my node for free or if I charge them for running their transaction through my node?


So what you are saying is, instead of putting my coins on an exchange platform and paying them a fee for changing between coins, I put my coins in a segwit address and pay the node runners you talk about above the fees for exchanging my coins?
edit: exchanged "money" with "coins". I'm a bit too far ahead in the future in my head, sorry
