That one was hard to detect, with all the FUD these days.  
I'm growing somewhat frustrated with the sentiment, that crypto is insecure, while the reasons ppl lose coins are bad habits and compromised machines from the get go.  
My hope for the future is that using crypto currencies forces users to think twice  
$ if they really want to install that flashlight app that wants access to their personal data, internet,...  
$ if they really want to download that cracked pirated software  
$ open that attachment with instructions to claim their lottery winnings  
....  
Speaking of which, just received a pm from a Bitcoin millionaire that wants to send me 0.1-0.15 BTC for my valuable contributions in this subreddit, yeahhh

With all the crap they probably have on their phone, a mobile wallet might not be the best solution. Esp. when they are new to Bitcoin and have no sense of security

@_date: 2014-08-11 11:35:15
Not really a problem since it could be fixed with a hard fork.  
IMO the biggest thread is overregulation and straight out banning of Bitcoin use.  
That way while the protocol is fully functionally etc, you would prevent most ppl from getting involved or cashing out, rendering it useless for most ppl. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:00:24
Only put pocket money on mobile wallet.  
Use offline generated paper wallets for secure storage of large amounts.  
And one of the several PC wallets for values in between.  
Don't put all your coins in a mobile wallet, install every spyware app the play store has to offer and cry about losing your coins. Be aware that your phone/pc/Mac is your bank now. Keep it safe!

If they add support for more coins, namely dogecoin.this will be funded within 24h.  
You might dislike other coins, but the demand for secure storage is universal (edit)

Replacing a secure system like bitcoin with an unsecure one like a credit card sounds backwards.  
Especially when you can pay by scanning a qr code with your phone without having to trust anyone with your private key opposed to the shared secret system in credit cards. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 18:07:08

When running a Bitcoin node I have the problem, that after my monthly IP change, the number of connected peers drops down to 8.  
Only after restarting bitcoind the client accepts inbound connections again.  
Is there an easy way to fix this?

@_date: 2014-06-27 18:27:00
By lack of security you mean your personal inability to handle your own security. E.g. following a step by step tutorial on creating paper wallets, or what? 
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:51:50
So why not all mine in one single large pool. If you say that mining is other wise not profitable for you, you are asking others to pay your bills by doing the right thing. They secure the network so the coins you mine are worth something.

No,  
brain wallets are private keys hashed out of supposedly random words you can remember more easily than a true random private key.
@_date: 2014-07-22 17:28:24
I'm pointing out 2 things.  
One is that blocks aren't found (exactly) every 10 minutes, but that is normal. 
The system is built so that it evens out at 10 minutes. (The difficulty adjusts itself that way)   
The other is, that some pools don't report the time correctly. The most recent block is set in the future
@_date: 2014-07-26 06:12:42
...aaaaaand they're gone.
@_date: 2014-06-08 09:05:24
You don't know that. There is no proof of an exploit.
@_date: 2014-09-13 19:30:08
That email response is bs. The wallet is literally a key chain. The coins themselves are stored in the blockchain, a decentralised ledger. The wallet aka keychain is used to prove to the blockchain that you own those coins and are allowed to transfer them.
@_date: 2014-06-24 13:57:52
proving my point,  
have a good day and you know where to stick it
@_date: 2014-07-13 17:44:20
Since everyone involved, has to do with crypto currency, this seems like an easy way to use the service for targeted attacks against the person viewing the ads. How are you going to screen ads to prevent this happening?

There is no difference between the keys you generate for paper wallets and the keys you generate with your Bitcoin-qt wallet (or whatever you use as a wallet)  
Randomness and a enormous pool of possible keys prevents generating two times the same key.

Don't, under no circumstances, use a brain wallet.  
Without the knowledge on how to make a secure one with enough entropy, you are basically giving them away to a bot .
@_date: 2014-06-09 10:36:14
Am I the only one that think subsidising p2p is a really bad idea. 
If p2p becomes more profitable, what holds ghash from sending part of their hash towards p2p pools, while quietly accumulating more than 50% of the network hash rate.  
They're in the business of maximising their profit, no matter what.  
Instead of donating, buy some ASIC and point them somewhere else.
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:13:55
It would only white wash the real state of the network and since they control the hash they could point it back to their own servers at any time
