P on!

This is awesome news! Time for the bulls to pull out there credit cards and save the day!  Wait....
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:51:46
Im pretty sure this is the cause of the dip. 
People thought yesterday a huge whale was trying to cash out.
@_date: 2018-02-22 01:09:12
Lots of news on it google bitcoin 20 trillion. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:41:29
How is that even possible 20 trillion? They actually have that much bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-22 00:53:27
The reason why bitcoin is crashing is because 20 trillions dollars worth of bitcoin was purchased for 0 yen on a Japanese exchange. Then that seller turned around and put a 20 trillion sell order up causing a huge panic. The fucking admins keep deleting any post that talk about it. Yeah I get you don't want to create FUD but let people know the real reasons why bitcoin is crashing. The problem has already been resolved with the exchange.

What does the bottom actually look like? How will we know?

You can use your debit card still, but banks are not allowing people to buy using credit. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:19:41
I agree, Its funny to see BCH and a pump and dump coin.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:11:11
Most of the bulls were using there credit cards, now that privilege has been taken a away. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:43:57
Cool story bruh.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:08:57
Yup, as much as this sucks that bitcoin is falling like this, it needs to happen. Once bitcoin is backed by real money and not credit it will make it stronger overall hopefully help with some of the volatility.

My pull out game is not very strong now I have two kids. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:10:22
Why? You realize these exchanges are open 24/7 they have no down time. Its not like they close on the weekend and can do maintenance. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:51:54
I hope this is the bottom and not a dead cat bounce.

I don't expect this comment to stay here long, as I already tried to submit link and left links in another post. It would be nice to let people know the real reason why its crashing so they can make a educated decision before they sale. Right they they are just following the other sheep.

Exactly! 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:34:43
How come this hasn't hit mainstream media?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:24:12
In the long run this is better for crypto, in the short term this is bad for crypto as a lot of people were using credit to buy bitcoin and now they can't jump in to catch the dip. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:44:03
I think this post is a joke
@_date: 2018-02-22 00:46:15
Bitcoin doesn't care about the interest rates from the government and banks. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:41:00
Looks like its dropping early.
