Or exchanges...or retailers that allow for crypto payments.
So what if you use VPNs to get around the **purchasing** restrictions. What the fuck you gonna buy with that crypto? Ooo, wow, I can buy this computer wit hmy crypto from overseas...or just go to Amazon and pay fiat. - This is why crypto hasn't taken off; it's too much of a PITA to use. Any kind of restrictions would make it even more difficult (and less appealing) to use.

If the US cracks down, then there's no US Citizens bring money into the crypto sphere....legally.
Take a look at a few years back when rumor spread that China was outright banning BTC; it went from $1k to $52 in ~24hrs. Then was around $125 the next day.
...this was on a rumor.
You say there's plenty of ways to use Crypto...yes. If you're not in a country that has banned its use. If the US banned it. What could *I*, a US Citizen, living in the US, buy?
-Newegg would drop support for Crypto.
-No company that does business in the US is going to support it. ((That whole "Freeze assets thing" we like to toss around.)) EDIT: So there goes you, getting dragged in. Because now your country's business aren't going to want to touch it (assuming they are international).
Which brings up the other issue. Does the entire supply chain support crypto payments for services/goods? No.
So, while Newegg (for example) supports Bitcoin. I bet ASUS doesn't accept the BTC they collect. ((But maybe they do...)) Does ASUS's suppliers support it? ((Maybe they do too...)) Does the raw material suppliers of ASUS's suppliers support it? ((Maybe they also do!)) Does the employee working in the mines accept BTC instead of fiat for their work?
Until all of the chain supports a form of payment, that form of payment is as fragile as the 'cured' glazing on a donut; one nudge and it breaks.
So saying "I don't care if they restrict it; it won't affect me" is foolhardy.

Well...the Feds are trying hard to bring Bitcoin under heavy regulation instead of adopting it as an alternative currency.
...do not be surprised if regulation fails the Government will outright ban the use of Bitcoin.
Likely using a false flag event to demonize Bitcoin. Because "bitcoin was used as a currency in order to buy the necessary items to carry out this heinous attack. Therefore, we are banning bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, we will work with the United Nations to stop this from happening elsewhere". (read: They'll use the UN as muscle to stomp out Bitcoin. Likely threatening "invention" in countries that do not comply.)

Apples and oranges.
If the IRS suspects you have 'hidden funds', they will submit their proof to the court, and the court will render a judgement. If the court finds sufficient cause to believe you have 'hidden money' (ie foreign bank account or...say...bitcoin) you will be ordered to turn over the appropriate documents to determine how much tax you owe.
Failure to do so will trigger [at least] two strikes against you: Tax Evasion and Contempt of Court [for refusing a court order].
Note: The poster of this, to me, is basically saying "you can't make me turn over my wallet address", when taken in context that they are in a subreddit for IRS. One would assume this "you can't make me" is in regards to paying taxes on earnings from said wallet holdings. So, my response is along that thought-train.
Pay your taxes. It's piss-easy to find deductions that reduce your taxable profit/income.
@_date: 2019-11-21 13:13:48
However, bots work on algorithms. People work on emotion and logic.
If a bot sees a significant drop between two reference ticks, it will sell (unless configured). Thinking a 'dump' is coming. Meanwhile people will 'panic sell', hold, or (using logic) wait for a bottom to then accumulate at the best possible 'discount' (since they aren't looking to sell anytime soon; drops in prices are just "discounted coins").
@_date: 2019-10-30 18:58:06
Re-reading my own comment I also thought...
What about taxes. xD
IRS doesn't accept BTC, which is why I think it's illegal to be required to pay tax on crypto; you get doubled tax. - First taxation is on the earnings when you sell. The second one happens when you're forced to exchange crypto for USD or any other Fiat for a country who's tax agency doesn't accept crypto.

Well, the easiest way (and I legit don't know) would be to see if other 'forms of publishing' are used as currency. - Not barter (ie I'll give you my copy of X-book for Y-goods).
((I did a quick search and saw where you might have gotten this from. I see that the article says the 1st Amendment would need to be removed first. I counter that by pointing out, despite my free speech, I cannot yell "FIRE!" in a theater, "BOMB!" in an airport, or make threatening "promises" towards politicians.
The premise of those restrictions on my freedom of speech is that I cannot make speech that inherently endangers the lives of others.
Crypto has no official backing. It's value is purely determined by what people are willing to buy it at. One could argue that people's lives are at risk because they have invested so much of their backed-currency that if this unback one fails; they'll starve to death.
The notion of a 'threat to national security' could also be rolled out.

Best I could find was this: 
"After April, Bitcoin price hovered around $120 until later in the year when prices suddenly skyrocketed to a high of $1,150 in late November. However, by mid-December, the price had *tumbled back down to less than half of that*, and that’s where it would stay for four years before crossing $1,000 again."
I wasn't looking at other exchanges, so all I've ever gone on around that time was BTCe's price.
So, like I said to another, it might have been a flash crash that pulled BTCe's price well-below the 'global' price.
@_date: 2019-10-30 21:17:10
When you say "This is not hypothetical". Are you implying the result wasn't a drop in BTC's value? If so, I'm not trying to imply that the drop would be long term. What I am saying is that drop may cause other places to 'get out'. Because they don't want to trade using a transaction medium that is currently in 'free fall'.
At some point fiat has to enter the crypto-sphere. That's the Achilles heel of all crypto. People don't look at the broader view of how currency works in an economy chain. They just see that: I can pay You in crypto; sweet! Fuck you 'The Man'!
I also don't think the world would unanimously ban anything (hell, we still got countries that have legal slavery). What I do think will happen is a nation or group of nations will ban 'unregulated' crypto (aka non-government backed crypto), and the price of the unregulated ones will tank; leaving many with near-worthless digits.
@_date: 2019-10-26 22:46:30
*We can make it illegal to use crypto as a medium of exchange for goods and services.*
((This is why I find it hilarious that people think crypto can 'out smart' The Man. At some point in the chain of commerce someone is going to want to exchange crypto for fiat. If they can't legally do that, they won't support it. That disrupts the entire chain and eventually you are left holding nothing more than data.))
@_date: 2019-10-30 18:10:37
EO 6102. - Banned the hoarding of a medium used as a 'store of value'.
And Bitcoin's potential standing as a 'form of publishing' is at the mercy of the SCOTUS, and how they interpret the Constitution.
@_date: 2019-10-30 18:07:35
Newegg still accepts Bitcoin.
Also, the *rumor* of China banning Bitcoin sent it from $1k to $52 in a matter of hours and kept it suppressed around the $300 for months.
Drugs aren't typically used to *pay* for things. And even then you quickly want to convert it to an accepted currency: USD, gold, silver, etc.

If it's outside the US, yes, of course you could still buy with crypto those gift cards.
But, if you're implying that you were still inside the US...how would you buy your crypto? You could go the reverse, buy gift cards with fiat and exchange them for Crypto. But...what do you do with the crypto then? You have something you can't spend in your country.
Now, if you're outside the country:
The ban goes into effect. The likely result is the price drops. If it drops too much those gift card suppliers may go under because they have crypto that maybe just lost half it's value before they could sell it all.
So while, in that case, you're not as affected. You still affected in some way by another nation's ban. - In that scenario; one less gift card seller to buy (using crypto) from.
@_date: 2019-10-30 15:10:43
/points at US Currency
While not a legally-enforced ban, using other currency is still "banned" by way of one side refusing to accept it as payment.
Test it out, assuming you're in the US, go and exchange something like $20 USD for $20 CAD. Now try to spend it.
*There is zero Federal Law on the books saying you can't use foreign currency or that a business can only accept 'legal tender' (aka USD).* But, you'll be hard-pressed to find someone willing to accept a foreign currency in lieu of USD.

This was on BTCe's charts circa 2013. It was the first time Bitcoin hit $1k USD.
EDIT: or was it 2012? I don't really remember the year and since BTC hit $1k twice before "dying" (only to 'phoenix' to over $2k) it's hard to say it was 'this year'. But it WAS the first time it hit $1k and everyone suddenly took notice of this "nerd money" thing called "cryptocurrency".
I watched it collapse to ~$72 (before I dragged my arse to bed), the next day it was ~$125. Looking at the previous days charts on BTCe, I saw it had hit a low of ~$52.
...this is BTCe before it had a change of ownership if that helps.
I, too, have looked at the 'global' charts on BTC, and it seems BTCe experienced a flash crash that went beyond what the other exchanges had during that rumor.
((To this day, it's my biggest regret. I saw the drop; thought "boy if I had BTC I'd be selling now". Woke up and thought "man if I had spare cash I'd be buying". - I wouldn't be stuck at a desk if I had. FML.))
@_date: 2019-10-30 18:43:52


No shit. It's US DOLLARS. It's the World's Currency Reserve.
My concern, if I were you, would be a nation banning crypto and having the value drop like a rock (like when the rumor of China banning it; $1k to $52 in hours). Which would cause your goods and service providers to jump ship on crypto because their transactions (with other businesses) still require fiat.
Basically, you'd be left with Bitcoin circa 2010, with no business accepting it due to price volatility fears.
@_date: 2019-10-30 20:40:12
We've yet to see a major power ban crypto. - I think it's still legal even in Russia; just Putin wants more regulation on it "or else".
I'm thinking of the domino effect. If a major power bans it, those citizens dump it. The crypto loses value, and then 'your' country suffers because the value of the asset just dropped.
My issue is when people claim nothing can stop Bitcoin. It's foolish and arrogant.
Always assume the worst can happen. - I think that's why most of us are here to begin with. We see that unbacked fiat is collapsing and gold/silver is no longer a sufficient means to store value in a digital world (jesus...imagine sending gold in the mail to pay some one overseas!).
((People do stupid shit all the time because they "don't think it'll happen to them". Be ever vigilant. Assume Bitcoin can be banned. Work to get it accepted so bans are frowned upon by the rest of the economy.))
@_date: 2019-10-30 12:49:38
Ban the **use** of Bitcoin. That's how you censor it.
People seem to forget: Until crypto is supported by all the links in the 'economy chain'; it will fail with something as simple as a 'banned as a form of transaction settling'. - Do you except BTC? You do? Awesome. Does your utilities? Does your grocery store? Does the employees of those places accept it? Do the suppliers of those places support it? What about the workers at the suppliers? What about the equipment vendors? - At any point where the answer is 'no', there is an easy way to 'censor' any crypto.
"But I'm not in 'x'- country". Remember when BTC hit $1000 USD for the first time? Remember when rumors spread that China was going to ban BTC? Remember how it went from just over 1k to $52 USD in a matter of hours?
...so while you're country might not ban it, the value of it can be drastically effected.
@_date: 2019-10-30 15:02:58
And how do you exchange your digital currency, you accepted, for 'money' so you can buy product from your suppliers?
(( 'You' being a business.))
That's why it's important that everyone accepts a currency (of any type). Once a link refuses (either out of legality or just out of preference); that's it, the currency is [effectively] dead.
@_date: 2019-10-30 21:04:09
The ban turned out to be a true FUD. China has just banned their financial industry from dealing with it. But the way the rumor had been spread it sounded like BTC was 100% banned in China and everyone was trying to 'get out'.
They later came out and clarified that they were not banning the general public from owning or using BTC; naturally the price shot back up, but not to where it had been...for a time.
What I'm worried about is people falsely believing that bitcoin (and other crypto) are 'untouchable', and then putting more money in than they can afford to lose. The resulting lose would prompt officials to begin meddling in the crypto-sphere.

1) 
...go to Fold's website, scroll down to the copyright section; look who owns it.
Additionally, these sites still need fiat to buy those gift codes. Yes, those companies outside the US would still be able to carry on. But those inside the US would be forced to drop crypto because their banks would drop them in a second if they were handling illegal tender (unless they can pay off the banks to look the other way; not like that hasn't happened in the past :P).
2) Purse is in the US. See

Not much use for crypto beyond 'get rich quick'. Until the entire Economy Chain supports crypto, there is no other reason to hold; beyond a certain amount...think Gold/Silver alongside other investments in a person's portfolio.

You're right, but if you ban the USE of crypto, then no bank is going to bank (fund) an entity that accepts it. You might still accept it, but your local grocery store won't.
The drop I witnessed was on BTCe. Was at ~$1010 and I watched it plummet to $800...then $300....I went to bed it was around $72 (it had already bounced). By the time I woke up it was ~$125. - I didn't check other exchanges because..."holy fuck, look at it go; so glad I don't have any". Which turned into "GOD DAMN SON OF A BITCH! I WISH I HAD SOME AND SOLD IT AT THE $800 MARK!"
This was when the rumor of China banning Bitcoin spread; it was the first time BTC hit $1k USD.
((Looking at the charts, none show the drop as steep as what happened on BTCe. So maybe the drop wasn't as bad?))
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:04:34
Not FUD; Fact.
If you want to buy from me. I'll accept BTC, but only because I, currently, can exchange it for fiat to pay my bills. If my country outlaws BTC, I suddenly can't do that; your currency (Bitcoin) is now worthless to me.
((Replace "me" with any service/goods provider you can think of; replace "country" with any country; replace "you" with any citizen of a fore mentioned country.))
Overall, decentralized crypto would be nearly impossible to ban with out international support (ie Central Banks). But to think crypto is some kind of untouchable beacon of freedom? Ludicrous.

Well, you don't really need to do much math, because the ounce isn't important.
That $5 certificate is suppose to always be worth $5 in silver. So if silver (per ounce) reached $10,000; you'd still only get $5 of it.
My issue is people don't seem to understand how money works, as in the underlying system of money.
Bitcoin can never be 'money' until the entire economic chain adopts it. If it ever does, that's when we'll see true stability. Until then, this is all a speculative market.
@_date: 2019-12-31 22:05:32
Seeing the faucet part made me cry... xD
@_date: 2019-12-03 13:06:49
It's better used as a store of value. Take that note. $5 worth of Silver exchanged at 1943's rate, which appears to be $0.35 USD per ounce (???) \[ [ \] would be worth $75 USD today ($5 of Silver (1943) times today's rate of \~$15 an ounce). Where as, today that note would still be worth $5 in silver (assuming it's still legally binding).
For something to be "money" it needs to have a few things:
* stability in value
* multiple means of exchange
Stability only comes from either a backing of physical assets (ie Gold) or a total adoption, where people now set the value ("I agree this is worth 5 BTC; here you go.").
For multiple means of exchange,  I can go to the store and pay with either a digital exchange (credit/debit card) or physical (cash). Since crypto is entirely digital it means people will need to use electronics to get the crypto around.
Now, this could be done using existing ATMs that print out a slip of durable fabric (akin to what USD is printed on or the 'plastic' cash Canada has). With something like a QR code representing the wallet address. However, then you'd need an escrow service that would store "X" amount of crypto for the crypto-supplier address. - Unless you trust the cashier to enter in the right amount to be transferred. :P
Obviously, the digital side is already covered with phone-based wallets and debit cards funded with crypto.
I just don't see crypto being adopted unless it's because a government switched over to their own. People just aren't going to trust something that one day is $19000, and then $7300 a year-ish later. At least not until the entire economy makes the switch. - You might accept crypto, but does your grocery store? What about their suppliers? What about the farmers? What about the farm equipment manufacturers? What about their employees? What about the material suppliers for the farm equipment manufacturing? ...So on and so on.
