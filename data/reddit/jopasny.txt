never fear, it's back up.

Exactly. As someone who is in China and knows chinese people who use crypto, I can say it is not "banned" and never has been. It's the same as back in North America, except in a country of 1.3 billion. Some people are clueless about it, some people have heard talk about it, and some people are heavily involved in bitcoin. But yeah, it seems that people outside of China generally have no idea what the status is here, and don't take 5 minutes to research and find out.
With all the stories about US bank accounts being suspended for trading too much BTC --&gt; fiat and vice versa, maybe the Chinese people are getting stories about "Bitcoin banned in the US!".

there's also the fact that they have never "banned" bitcoin, yet most people seem to think they have.

Believe it or not, China does not just have "a select few" who are into Bitcoin/crypto to gamble. I'm sure there is some of that too, but one of the other things that attracts the Chinese to cryptos is that it is a way to not only invest (legitimately), but hide money they shouldn't otherwise have, especially since avenues like property ownership are heavily regulated.
Even if China has a smaller percent of the population trading, it is a smaller percentage of 1 billion+  A lot of people in China are also getting rich fast, so the amount of $ they might have can be significant. I wouldn't over emphasize that it's just gambling.
It seems you're probably misinformed on the status of Bitcoin in China. It's actually not "banned", but regulated. Banks and payment companies are not allowed to give prices in btc, buy/sell btc, or insure Bitcoin related products. Individuals are free to hold and exchange Bitcoin, and with it being unregulated in Hong Kong, it's not all that inaccessible. Btc China can have a bank account linked to it too, afaik... not sure how they get around the regulation.
I think that the mythic image of China as some monolithic regime makes people assume that this case regulation = Bitcoin is a crime punishable by death. Just like many other laws in China, it's somewhat grey, open to interpretation and most likely going to change and be selectively enforced. But ultimately, it's simply not true.

well, the writing was on the wall, but we can call it a calculated risk. At least it wasn't more!
