I was the same mining back in 2012 for 30 min to an hour then said fuck it, this will be a waste of my time. If only I could go back and tell my self to leave my computer on all day mining and buy what you can. Oh well.

People do that every day with regular fiat and that doesn’t hurt the image of that. People know that if it can be used for a currency, it will most likely be spent on illegals.
