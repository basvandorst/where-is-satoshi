Garage or shed would work too. But I agree. Days of easy mining anywhere is fading away by the day. Need the cheap electric

Nowadays people mine altcoins or shitcoins and exchange them for BTC at market. 
You'll make the most btc that way mining, rather than mining BTC itself.
Either $10btc a month mining bitcoin
$30 ethereum a month transferred to $30btc so $30 Bitcoin a month

Past Reddit tips, people tipping .1btc or amounts near there. It was pennies at one time obviously not the case now.
Hell, I remember websites that gave ya .05 or .1btc for watching a 30sec video. They had no idea what was coming ha.

Oh sweet! much thx, I figure lots will be coming your way and that warehouse will be full in no time ha

Yea ive tried cloud mining, no bueno lol. moreso just asking if your taking people's miners (having them ship you their hardware) to strictly mine it for them and you take a cut. Figure at that point people would send ya s9s by the hundreds just to get them running. Getting unused miners running with no upfront cost besides shipping to you. 1st month mining pays fees etc.. but sounds like from that you do both! Sell miners ya have and will house people's miners for a fee��

Have you guys ever thought of making a business of maybe (just thinking of it off top off the my head) making independent contracts with people, (people who own miners specifically) taking in people's miners with the cheap electric you have and charging a maintenance/housing fee? Paying for any upgrades/maintenance distributed through the contracted miners. After all, any upgrades benefit all the miners. Just a thought,
Myself, I have miners but my location is not profitable until the price triples so it would be very worth to mine this whole time bearish sending them somewhere for the time being; having them at least do something rather than collect dust.��‍♂️ Just an idea, I'm sure lots of people would appreciate it, I just have no clue how it could be done legally speaking haha. Lots of contracts/liabilities involved.

Dollar cost average
@_date: 2019-03-13 00:56:36
Lol I'm a miner as well all my miners have been unprofitable for monthhhhs I'm surprised your switching now considering bear market could be coming to an end. One opinion��‍♂️

Would be cool in the future if people find keys randomly in books and stuff haha. Get a book at a garage sale and find it has a random seed key in it lmao talk about hidden finds ��

I wish. Bought around the same time little less initial cost and maybe ran for 2 months. Negative negative negative since. New miners out now, so even more Negative on ones purchased. 
Wish China stopped mining lol and mining was relied on heavy kwh$ costs. More it costs to mine more it drives the price up. So lucky to have free electric, I'd be taking advantage running 10, or starting side hustle of taking people's old ones and take a cut, etc.. get the warehouse going�� 
so many people sitting on miners collecting dust now because of market crashing and now with new miners out hashrate always breaking ath the old are worthless. But with free electric they're never going bad. Always money to be made. Poor person paying the electric tho haha they're f**kd��

This hypothetical is based around price, how it changes people's views on this Reddit sub. As for adoption, imagine it a year later on lol��. Adoption isn't going to boom just because of a halving, it's steadily building, getting more aware all around the globe, steadily growing business that accept and use BTC everyday. So we can safely assume a year on it will steadily grow as it has.
Adoption will lead the way with price and the life of BTC, more adopted it is, the more true value it has, but with the halving, people/majority of community is expecting a huge bull run to new ATH so I'm curious if we don't hit that does people's view change? Or is it nothing in the grand scheme of things for them personally.

13k-15,600 my guess��‍♂️����
@_date: 2019-06-11 18:53:42
Ok lol I think anyone knows what I mean. 
I and l 
 &amp; To elaborate more.. 2 similar looking numbers and/or letters lol
@_date: 2019-06-12 11:14:25
Back in my day we had O and 0 and l and I all the time in addresses����️ 
If current example is needed though, 5 And S��
@_date: 2019-06-20 21:03:17
Puts it in perspective...�� Lots of room to grow!

A) same answer goes for anyone with money in general I'd say. Anyone that looks like they'd have money or pulls out a $50 from their wallet can get jumped in the alley. Most people I'd say also don't have much on their wallet they carry around day to day for normal purchases(like pizza), ya don't wanna pull out your wallet of 100btc letting everyone around you know (just as you don't pull out wads of $100's) to make a .00001btc, $10 purchase lol. But I get what you mean. Spend BTC and people know, so now they can rob ya. Heck, some people get jumped for no reason��‍♂️
No legal recourse is the main reason too back in ~2012 before "fomo and hodl" the main saying was "never tell anyone your invested into Bitcoin, not even your family or friends" eventually one day a relationship could change and ppl could turn on ya knowing what you have, or potentially have.
 No one can just take your money though, that's what keys are for. You own your keys, you only send money when your authorization key is typed in and confirmed. If someone stole your phone they have a phone. Not any of the money on that phone. Same goes for stealing a phone that has a bank acct linked. They'll Need the password. 
B) yeah unfortunately ya gotta triple check address your sending to or just use QR codes since they are hardcoded with the right address. Sometimes the O and 0 are hard to differentiate so understandable people make a mistake and send money the wrong place.
Fix for this I'd say is anytime your sending a significant amount of money, do a 'test' run before, sending $2. Make sure it gets there. Then send the $1000 or 100k or whatever your sending.

True that lol. Same goes for money but yeah Bitcoin is not insured. Give em the coins and hope you don't have the life savings on ya all the time! Haha. I'm sure as we go on to there will be some insurance of some sort (long term). Or hope take the bullet and pass the fortune on to your family (if they have access to keys). Kidding of course, not worth dieing ha
@_date: 2019-09-30 06:51:42
True that haha. Didn't account for how much electric you can use. Not sure how much each room allows before tripping a circuit but makes sense it would be limited
@_date: 2019-09-29 23:05:56
If you're staying in hotel rooms where essentially what your saying is you have free electric, I'd personally get an asic miner or two (resold most likely so it's cheapppp) and have a sound box for them. No one would know your mining and it would be a good constant side nest egg. 
Could get a S9 for ~ $300-$350
That mines about ~0.00819 BTC/month ($66) at 24hr.
So 1/2 a month at 24hr/day would get you ~$33/per miner.
Bright side is that 30$ a month could turn into $150/month per miner if BTC hit new ath but that's nothing to hope for. Just a silver lining
You don't need lots of miners to make money.. you need a lot of miners if you want it to take care of all living expenses and replace a full time job but lots mine for side income or nest egg for long hodl.

Ahh makes a lot more sense. Wondering why no one was discussing this lol. Thx much
