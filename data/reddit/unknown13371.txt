What you say is true but consider this:

Maybe the senator should also consider banning the dollar because of the Madoff Era where 50 billion U.S. dollars were stolen from customers.

I live in Toronto and there is a BitCoin ATM that charges 3.5%.
I bought some bitcoin with quickBT today as I figured that even their price is about 11% above market price, I still have to pay 6$ for transit to get to the bitcoin ATM there and back and with the 3.5% added on top, buying from quickBT is only about 2$ more expensive as I was buying 0.1 bitcoins. It is better to save time than to loose 2$

Like it or not the IRS is right, Bitcoin (at its current state) is just a property however as Bitcoin becomes increasingly popular and there are more uses of it, IRS will change their rules.

Its currently the opposite. You can only buy but not sell. :D

MtGox will affect bitcoin prices short term, but they need to go to prevent these fluctuations.

What do you expect, Bitcoin is a competitor to Ebay's PayPal. This post is just ridiculous.

It seems that you just started paying attention. All the items you listed has been going on ever since the financial crisis. it's all panic talk except for the crash in oil prices which is at the second consecutive year now (if I'm not mistaken). The oil crash hasn't had a recession type impact on the US compared to other countries around the world including Canada. So far things seem to be playing out just fine for the US.
Also the US economy is still showing small growth after pulling out of that recession.
