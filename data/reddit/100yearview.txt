Do we need a currency where transactions are not controlled by another centralized third party?
(New post by redditor for a day!) &lt;= I've got my reasons.
A friend of mine lives about 1000 miles away.
He had a really bad last few weeks. Really bad.
I wanted to send him $100 for some work he did.
The money was not for wasteful things, but for food and basic living expenses.
This was legal, helpful, good work he did, that he can be proud of.
He has a paypal account, so I sent the money using good old fashioned paypal.
I even paid extra to cover the fees.
On his end it shows he got paid.
Paypal was going to hold the funds for security reasons, to protect the seller.
He does his research and finds the steps that are needed for me to release the funds.
I go through paypal clicking the required buttons.
Yet at the end, the money over a week later still is not released to him.
He researches more and paypal tells him I need to to call paypal, prove who I am and then they will release.
I call paypal and they say they have a 1.5 hour wait.
Or, I can press a button and then they will call me back.
That means I need to pick up a call from an unknown number at their convenience.
For all of this I am paying them about 2.5% of the transaction or whatever it is.
Does this sound like a good system?
Would it make sense for all of us to strengthen lightening and to create a faster, lower fee method?
Is there benefit in BTC?
Is there benefit in lightening?
What happens when you go to get your own money out of the neighborhood bank and they won't give it to you?
(If you read the history of this reddit you will that happened to some.)
The point is this.
1 BTC is still equal to 1 BTC.
In 10 years if 1 BTC is worth $234,000 U.S. Dollars it will still be worth 1 BTC.
In 10 years if 1 BTC is worth $0.27 U.S. Dollars it will still be worth 1 BTC.
I will HODL until I can walk down to the noodle stand and buy my noodles with Satoshis or BTC.
The poor guy in some country somewhere whose local currency is crumbling will be able to buy food and goods with his BTC.
The country who can't maintain a stable currency will have the option to switch to BTC.
The person saving for retirement who can't afford the risk of inflation will have the option to move his money into BTC.
I would like them all to have this option just as easy as they currently have to get online. 
I would guess that there will be strong use cases for government backed currencies for a long time.
There will also be strong use cases for BTC permanently.
Remember, no matter how many government dollars they give you for your BTC, your BTC will always be worth 1 BTC.
So I'll keep hodling till we can all buy our noodles, sausage, chicken, potatoes, lentils and brussel sprouts with satoshis.

Bitcoin looked at itself in 2016 and said I am worth 1 BTC.In early 2017 it looked in the mirror, hopped on a scale and said to itself I am worth 1BTC.
In late 2017 it heard a lot of people were excited about how valuable it was, so it looked at itself very, very, very carefully and disappointedly found out it was worth 1BTC.
Then it panicked in Feb. 2018 when it heard it was worthless and realized.... oh.... it was worth 1 BTC.
And now late 2018 with cheerers carrying it up to the heavens, and trolls crushing it down to the ground, it looks at itself and says.
I give 1BTC of FU24$ what you think of my value.
I am still worth 1 BTC.
(Insert gif of BTC standing proudly on the moon with a cape blowing in the moon wind glaring into the camera.)

Because one day you will be smart enough to realize that 1 to 2.5% of every transaction you make goes to the banks.   
After that money has been passed through about 70 transactions and comes back around to you, the entire amount of money you started with has gone to the bank. This causes the banks to win over and over and over again and the average earthling to not understand why they keep going into debt.
