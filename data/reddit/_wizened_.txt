Oh I didn't realize I could get a gc and purchase with it instantly via gold online.
Because I can't.  Not to mention the host of other problems trying to convert gold, and the 10%+ fees
@_date: 2017-03-01 09:36:05
Can you point me to some specific articles showing the use of gold in a currency collapse, like you said Africa did?
@_date: 2017-03-03 01:08:08
Only a small gold position.

If someone is a verifiable criminal, I'd prefer to know.  Speaking of, where are Trumps tax returns?

Guy from that past post wrote that 1 btc = 238oz gold in scarcity.  That's  about $295,000.00 per btc.
Another guy in another post today calculated that 1 btc had to = 238,000.00 for the winklevoss twins to have the same amount of money as zuckerberg.
Currently 1 share of BRK/A is 266,000.00.
I can't see btc ever getting more valuable than these calculations.

* you're
Go try to turn gold into anything, 10% premium. 
Bitpay is more closely related to credit card fees of 2-3%.  I have to believe you're aware of what Amex, visa and MasterCard charge to use their network.
1% vs 3-10%.   You clearly are bad at math on top of comprehension and spelling.

When this happened I asked my local office  gold bug when the last time he bought anything on Amazon with a bar of gold.
He said never, and then asked if it was possible to buy anything on Amazon for btc.  I explained giftcards, and he was surprised.
This is still very early adoption phase

Gyft.com (possibly others)
Buy gc's with btc.
Use gcs for the stores you bought.

Sorry I meant text, can't watch vids or quote them. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 10:34:17
Specific articles where it has been used in the last 60 years for this purpose, or even to buy bread?
@_date: 2017-03-03 19:49:06
I mean, this is how I felt about 100 and 1000, and exactly how I feel about 10,000.  No way.
I've been wrong twice before.

Yeah pretty disingenuous.  I was excited about it but 1 franchisee is not remotely 'acceptance'
