They are startups that never made money.  Also, you never invest in a single company, ever.  You diversify.
Stock prices cannot fall to zero for most stock because the underlying business is profitable so you have dividends and the price someone would pay to buy up the company.  Also the assets the company owns.  
Crypto has no underlying value to set a floor, its simply worth zero dollars.

And goods are all set in usd or another fiat.
BTC doesn't work like that unless you structure an entire economy around it where everyone is paid in btc bottom to top.
Right now all cryptos at best are just a digital way to transmit fiat by converting fiat to crypto and then crypto back to fiat.

BTC is down to 10k and you laugh at me?  I made 4k off the dips of the last week and if it goes up, that is pure profit.
I can only lose if the bottom drops out and everything is worthless.  I am the same as a holder, but I make money going down in addition to going up.

Oh dear. You are stupid.  You just repeated what I said.
Now if you do agree volume is what it is, then you agree volume is the closest you are going to get for prediction and market cap has no bearing on anything.

The second there is no new buyer is the second the coin drops to zero dollars in value.
Crypto works like a ponzi scheme.  For every dollar someone gains, someone else must lose a dollar.  The crypto itself has zero value so its even worse than milkshake companies or makeup companies that make the newbies buy product.

Please list some smart contracts that need blockchain and are not viable any other way.  Bonus if you can explain how they fund all the nodes on the blockchain so they stay online.
The rest of things you listed aren't things or just rehased smart contracts.
As for your bitcoin list, no one cares about any of that.  Fiat already does all that.  Bitcoin right now can only compete with wire transfers due to the high fees.  When banks adopt their own SWIFT competitors that lower fees, bitcoin loses that.

They aren't blocking you from spending money on exchanges or anything like that.
So far, it has only been some credit card companies that have blocked transfering money to exchanges and no one has any information why.  Credit card companies will cut off a merchant if there are too many chargebacks and that easily could have happened if multiple people lost money on an exchange and filed a chargeback on their credit cards.

Stocks have value backed by the business.  Via dividends and the price of a take over.  Just back businesses that are viable, not startups that are high risk and are worth nothing if their business model fails.
Crypto is like the startup that fails, but worse because it has no chance of succeeding as it will never have an underlying value like a successful business.

Nope, I am enjoying using facts to crush the insecure morons acting like cryptos are the new gold rush.
It isn't inventing wealth, its just moving it out of one person's pocket into another.    Every dollar taken out as profit has to be eaten by someone else as a loss.  There is no way around it.
When you see people taking out millions, that is millions lost by other people.  Perhaps so many people that each only lost 50 bucks, but the total amount is real.

You don't if you think bitcoin is worth anything more than zero dollars.

Lots of people bought at 19.5k.  But more sold off.
Wall street getting involved means more people buying to get into the hype, so expect mad gains.  Those that want to sell will have the opportunity without tanking the price.
Just be sure you time it right, once the new consumers dry up, it all crashes.  In theory if people hold long enough, that could be years or decades away.  But once mass selling starts, its will be over for most holders.
If for some reason it never crashes, then bitcoin will basically end up like a stock on the sock market with average stock market like gains.  Enough people will see it as a stable investment that they just dump 401ks into it.  I see this happening only if bitcoin ends up working as a currency so it has high liquidity.

Then I buy back and take a tiny loss or just stay in USD, it depends where I sold.
But the key is sell high and wait for dips.  You can't lose because if you end up stuck holding, you just wait for the coin to go back up.  I sold out at 1k eth.  Currently eth is 987, it fell down to 920 an hour ago.  Had I jumped in, I would have made about a grand.  But I am looking for deeper dives.

@_date: 2018-01-22 21:24:11
On gdax you can swap usd for btc or eth for free.  
If it is dropping I can get out of either, wait until it drops more, then get back in.  If it goes up, I can buy back in right where I sold if I didn't find a comfortable bottom.
All you need to do is make sure you don't buy it for more than you sold it for.
On binance, you need to take your selling price and add the fees for two additional transactions for the break even buy back point.  So its a little more risky.
The best part is that if you buy back in and then it drops more, all you did was cut out some of the losses.  You will gain more when it goes back up.

Its true whether you like it or not.
If buyers of bitcoin disappear and owners are stuck with bitcoin worth zero dollars, what value is the coin itself?  Zero dollars or is there some magical use for digital coin that has value?
Gold for instance will never be cheaper than the demand for its use as a material.  A stock for instance will never drop below the amount someone would pay to take the business over or the value of dividends.
Bitcoin has no inherent value, it will simply be worth nothing.

It cannot.  You immediately buy in for the same price you sold.  Say you fucked up and you buy in for 5 bucks more than you sold.  That is trivial compared to what you gain if you catch a dip one time.  You you would have to lose 20 times to negate a single dip.  You won't lose that much at all.

I don't get it, sounds like it dropped to 12k and he kept shorting(assuming it would fall), but it kept going up and kept shorting more and more each time it went up 1000.  So he just kept throwing money away because shorts required him to sell and take losses after a set period of time.
Had he simply played the dips by selling high and only buying in a dip, he would have kept making coin. The beauty of this position is that if it drops and doesn't increase, you can simply hold and wait.  Your 300btc will stay 300btc.
He took shorts which forced him to sell after a period of time and forced him to take losses.

Shorting is stupid because you can be forced to sell.  Selling is the only way to lose(until the entire market of coins collapses because no one wants to buy them anymore).
Had he just bought low and sold high using the current dips in the market, he couldn't have lost a single coin. In the even he guessed wrong, he could simply hold and wait for the usd value to be restored.
Shorting meant that when he guessed wrong, he is forced to sell and lose all his coin.
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:19:39
You are so dumb, you can't see a scam.  The fact is the last people to sell out of the coin get stuck holding the back.  They fund the profits extracted by taking the losses.

I don't pay a tax when I transfer 10 bucks using chasePay to a friend.  Why would I do so via a btc transfer.
While conversion of usd to btc is taxable and conversion from btc to usd is also taxable, you only pay on monetary gains.  If conversion is fast enough, there won't really be gains and losses when I buy btc to send someone else money and they sell the btc for cash again.

First, this should have always been a cash advance.  There is no valid reason why it should be considered a credit card purchase.  Credit card companies do not like when people run credit cards to get money like an ATM. 
Second, coinbase is at fault for running them as credit transactions when they know they shouldn't have.  They got away with it by eating the 3% fee themselves.
Third, this is better for everyone.  Cash advance won't have the protection of credit card transasctions.  So if an idiot buy crypto and loses money, they cannot file chargeback.

Hogwashery.  If you transfer USD gains back into your own account, you are nabbed and will pay the taxes.  You can't dodge taxes with crypto any more than you can with any other cash transaction and that is only if you find some off the books way to convert your crypto gains to cash without using bank accounts or a US/Europe based crypto exchage.
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:10:33
I can swipe my credit card right now and usd is deducted.  Why would I want to have to convert my money to volitile bitcoin to pay someone else in bitcoin who then has to convert it back to usd?
And if you think the usd to bitcoin conversions will be automated, then what is the point? If it feels the same as transfering cash, then the user won't care about the coin aspect or even know it is there.  Thus any service with the lowest fees wins, wether that is chase pay or some kind of crypto coin with automatic conversion to usd.

But it is sporadic and at the end of the day those people immediately converted your crypto to USD, deafeating the purpose.
You would need a real economy where either side isn't just converting between crypto and USD, where people actually hold crypto  and make multiple transactions with it without ever converting to fiat.  So you need marchants, suppliers, utilities, landlords, and employees all to take crypto without needing to convert it to fiat.

It has nothing to do with efficiency. It has everything to do with hedging against losses.
Today people now invest in total market index funds.  But in the 90s before people realized total market funds was where it is at, they still didn't invest in single companies.  They spread money around to avoid losses if one goes under.

Holders are the ones who can shoot for dips, because if you miss, you just hold and will have saved yourself some of the losses.

The biggest fuck up of all time was bailing out the banks, but not absolving the debt.
They gave money directly to the banks and let them keep all the debt on paper.   Any bailout should have involved them signing off debt equal to what they got in bailout funds.   Instead the banks got bailed out, waited 2-3 years to get their records in order and for a recovery to happen, then foreclosed on all the properties that the government insulated them from.  So they got the bailout and the recovered properties.  The consumer paid for it in taxes and lost their homes.

First, credit or debit?
Second, if they block credit card transaction with coinbase, that means morons losing money are filing chargebacks or reporting coinbase as fraud.  Banks don't just ban merchants for no reason.
That said, yes, if they freeze your card over a purchase you purposely tried to make, you do need to switch banks. No customer should tolerate that kind of bullshit.  Its one thing to deny the transaction, but freezing cards makes no sense. (you should demand they overnight you a new one at the very least)
That said, if you are using a debit card as a credit card online, you are setting yourself up for this kind of garbage.  Get a real credit card for online use.  As long as you pay the bill off each month, you pay no interest.  Debit cards are for debits, not online credit purchases. Debit cards used online expose your bank account directly to fraud. Credit cards insulate you from fraud and having your money locked while the banks investigates.

You don't get it.  No one can convert bitcoin to cash without selling it to someone who wants to convert cash to bitcoin.  Period.  
That is the only way.  I people buying into bitcoin dries up, bitcoin will crash because people are still going to want out and will have to lower what they get hoping to attract buyers.
Bitcoin as a currency isn't sustainable due to the high fees.  You can't even transfer bitcoin to someone else without paying.  It would be one thing if fees only existed when converting bitcoin to cash, but they exist just to pay with bitcoin.  Bitcoin fees itself to death just by using it.
What makes it worse, the stores that do accept bitcoin for purchases immediately sell the bitcoin off for cash.  So there isn't really any kind of bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:42:55
I can't wait for "Man I wish I had sold when they were 15000$ so I could be a millionaire now".

It is all exchanges.  They are businesses and they hold your money.  If you are lucky fees will cover all their operating expenses.  But if not, they will rack up debts and your cash will pay for that if they go bankrupt.
The sad fact is during a boom like bitcoin has right now, any business could be operating like a pyramid scheme and no one is going to notice until the new money stops coming in and everything tries to withdrawal.  So in this case, no one is going to know if their exchange is bad or good until bitcoin collapses.
When dealing with bitcoin, you have to be prepared to get screwed over.  If you can't take that risk, you need to be more conservative and pull money out, but that means less gains.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:40:43
I could see it. Since they would take a cut of the coin and sell it for fees and then send the remaining bitcoin to the seller.
There is no real risk of loss for ebay since they can reject any transaction where they cannot immediately sell part of the bitcoin for their fees.
They could do some kind of escrow to try to prevent some fraud, although they also could only let high rated sellers deal in bitcoin too.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:32:58


Not bankruptcy.  I also doubt it covers "accidental" deletion of coins either and has outs if latest security updates are patched.
But bankruptcy is the biggest risk.
When converting to cash, does it require a buyer in real time? Or does it convert to cash on paper and wait for a buyer when you withdrawal?
If realtime, that is best.  But then you still need to wait to get the money out and if they go belly up, you don't get any of the money.
If they immediately convert to cash that doesn't exist and hold the bitcoins themselves, then they are really gambling.  But then they make a ton of extra money as long as bitcoin keeps going up because they get the difference between what you sold it for and what it sells for down the line when they really sell it for cash.  This would make bankruptcy automatic if bitcoin falls.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:37:53
And when the buyers dry up, it all collapses very hard.
That is why people with billions in bitcoin are looking for ways to sell off the bitcoin outside of any bitcoin exchange.  Package up bitcoin into an investment product and sell it to wall street for cash.
If they tried to sell in a bitcoin exchange, they would either destabilize bitcoin and crash it or they would have to sell low amounts per day and it could take decades to cash out.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:37:43
But they are still only amassing bitcoins.
Has anyone done a study on how much bitcoin could feasibly be converted to cash per day without collapsing the value in addition to the normal buying and selling?
It could be something stupid low like 10k, that would mean it would take 274 years to extract 1 billion dollars from bitcoin.
Which is why I think major holders want to create that derivative crap.  They want a way to dump their bitcoin without affecting the bitcoin market itself.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:22:18
BTC to cash?
A delay buying in is one thing, but as we see with BCH, coinbase isn't going to let you withdrawal anything if they don't want  you to.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:55:57
Well, when bitcoin becomes viable for actual purchases and there aren't tranasfer fees for simply using bitcoin, then I will reevaluate.
Right now bitcoin fees prevent any kind of bitcoin economy.  Without a bitcoin economy, bitcoins don't have a utility that encourages people to buy into it and never sell out of it.  So that the wealth stays in bitcoin.  
Bitcoin won't work if the value of bitcoin is only pegged to the amount of people trying to buy bitcoin.  When the buyers dry up, bitcoin collapses.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:30:04
But trading bitcoin just amasses more bitcoin. They have to cash the bitcoin out and sell it for dollars, no?
Won't the act of people attempting to sell bitcoin for dollars drive the price way down if there are no buyers?
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:38:55
Those with bitcoin will need to sell it to realize any gains.  If a collapse happens, odds are they will lost pretty much all value.
The problem is when people stop buying bitcoin for cash, there is nor real way to convert bitcoin to cash.  You basically have to pull out before any collapse to win.

None of the other exchanges did that to me.

And if things collapse, you won't get the chance.  That is the problem.  These companies can freeze withdrawals if they can't cover it.
You really do have to get out before everyone else to be safe.  There is just no way to know what that is.
These companies get to declare bankruptcy and walk away if they blew user's cash for operating expenses.
That is why people who have something in life they want, should cash out and get it.  Buying a house is a great one.  When the bottom drops out most bitcoin investors are going to lose.

If you really wanted to make a difference, target the creation of new technologies.  Find an engineer like elon musk and make something new that the world needs.
But if you must do charity, look for ones that don't need much, but turn out something new.    They raised 50k for their initial creation, but needed another 150k to go commercial.  Their main site: 
Projects like that don't need much money and could result in a useful product that sells itself that helps something, like in this case monitor water quality and collect data that otherwise isn't being collected.  Dropping a million bucks on something like that could make a huge difference.  They could set them up in remote areas of the world for data monitoring like the amazon.

So your entire argument is that bitcoin fees won't negatively affect bitcoin because altcoin trading avoids fees somehow?  Sorry, but transfering you bitcoin means I pay a fee.  It doesn't matter if you are sending me back cash, altcoins, or physical goods.  There is no way around the fee.
As long as there are high fees for transmitting coin between people, bitcoin isn't sustainable as a currency.
Right now its value is proped up on supply and demand.   If demand drops, it all crumbles.  If supply(the amount of people trying to sell) increases, it all crumbles.
Bitcoin requires more people to be buying bitcoin for cash than are trying to sell it for cash.  When that ratio flips, bitcoin flips.


Gold is free to hand to someone. There are no fees involved if you buy and sell goods with gold.  Gold only requires a fee if you want to convert it to cash and only because someone might not buy gold from  you directly as there is no level of trust.  If you must sell to a middle man, then there is a fee.  
That said, if no one wanted to buy gold, the price of gold would fall.  It is still supply and demand.  It has an advantage in that it is a physical product that goes into electronics so there will always be some kind of demand for it and that large holders of it aren't selling what they have.  If everyone who owned gold tried to sell it at the same time, the price would drop heavily.  The floor would be based on the demand by companies using it for products who must still buy it. If they are willing to buy tons of it for future production at low prices that would prevent even lower prices.


This seemlying has nothing to do with what I said and makes little sense. You seem to have a chip on your shoulder.  First, the dollar is not pegged to gold.  Gold could become worthless tomorrow, it would harm the value of the dollar.  In fact, it would increase the value of the dollar since more people would want dollars.  Second, the reverse is meaningless.  Why would it matter if people buy gold with dollars?  Not sure what you mean by this.
