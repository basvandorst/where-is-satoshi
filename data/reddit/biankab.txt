No! Just an example of a short url. There's many services out there, like addfly and a ton of others. If it's short url, **don't click it.** You never know whats waiting on the other side. I'm sure there are good ones, but bad out weighs the good.

Hi, xxxx
So if you would like to pay for 1.0 Bitcoin
You can buy this item:
1OO.OO$ x 10 cards, you have to send me the card codes, we will check the balances - ef everything is ok, we will send 1.0 Bitcoin 1-2 min.
Thank you

It is true. No one is using Bitcoin besides gambling sites. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:53:17
There's no mention of Bitcoin anywhere in that commercial. This is a bunch of crock.
