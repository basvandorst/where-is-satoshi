Did you look at the output? Your script shows approximately 10% DoS.
Edit: Oh. I get your confusion. The issue is that the DoS is all or nothing for any set of masternodes. It's not 10% of transactions getting DoSed, it's 10% of block periods having all transactions DoSed.
Edit 2: Wait, there's a system for removing nodes? That's really hard to do properly, you really need to describe that.

Except, no. An attacker can still have greater network connectivity than you, and mount a succesful attack. Or be associated with a mining operation, or own your network.
This is utterly false, dangerous misinformation that WILL lead to people losing a lot of money. (0-conf transactions have done this many times in the past.) Please downvote this topic to hell.
@_date: 2014-12-09 15:13:33
1. There is an incentive for nodes to accept double spends. This means that as time progresses, we will expect the security of accepting zeroconfs will approach zero.
2. There is an unknown amount of Bitcoin which has been lost. This both depresses the value of Bitcoin (because people perceive it to be less scarce than it actually is) and presents a threat to markets (because it is possible for a large amount of Bitcoin to suddenly become active from an unknown source).
3. Miners are incentivised to not run full nodes. There is a way to fix this by altering the proof-of-work algorithm, but it will not be implemented.
4. The script system is beyond awful.
5. Confirmation times are very long, and re point 1, zeroconfs will eventually become completely unacceptable, meaning that you'll have to wait ten minutes for every transaction.
6. Scalability is a huge issue. There are fixes for some causes that are being implemented, but even after implementing these there will still be major problems. There are some solutions to these (albeit with major tradeoffs), but these will not be implemented.
7. Mining is quite centralised, and will only become more so. This is really hard to fix.
8. The protocol is quite crufty and rather odd, and this will never be fixed.
9. It's really easy to get your Bitcoin stolen, even to some extent with multisig. There are protocol modifications which could be made to partially help with this, but they will not be implemented.
10. Bitcoin is not anonymous at all. Mixing doesn't help. CoinJoin doesn't help. There is a solution to this, but it will not be implemented.
11. Due to the difficulty and risk of changing the protocol, many new and important features, now and in the future, will likely never find their way into Bitcoin. This is by no means an unjustifiable stance, but I do believe it will, eventually, result in Bitcoin becoming overtaken by something that does provide these features.

If there are 10 attackers (from 1000 total potentials), the chance of an attacker not being chosen is .99. In order for the system to not be DoSed, an attacker must not be chosen 10 times. The probability of this is (slightly less than) 0.99^10, which is about 0.9. This means that about 1 in 10 block periods will not have instant confirmations in this scenario.

I don't see spending 30 seconds typing a password as a big barrier in comparison to the time it takes to get keys from cold storage. Per-address encryption keys would be nice as well, and help with this.
Right now it takes around 5 minutes to decrypt the file it's stored in with gpg, copy it out, then type in the rather long dd command in a terminal (which I had to root my phone to get) to wipe it from storage. AND that's still not terribly secure due to weirdness in how SD cards work internally.
In the real world, people don't really need to spend Bitcoin every 5 minutes, so a phone unlock length password is just silly.

Just finished the paper, and among a few other issues I found which I won't bother to report on, the most glaring is how susceptible this is to DoS, which indeed is often likely going to occur even unintentionally. This system requires everyone making a transaction to connect to one of 10 nodes randomly selected from a large pool. If any of the 10 nodes fails to authorise a transaction, whether by malice or because it has gone offline, the transaction must wait for confirmation in the blockchain. That means that to DoS the network, an attacker need only DoS the weakest masternode selected, which in turn implies that _every masternode must be capable of withstanding a DoS attack by an extremely capable attacker_. Given that they claim to have 1000 independently run masternodes, this seems pretty implausible. Because of this, I don't expect that instant transactions will be working very often.

Due to its volatility, Bitcoin denominated loans aren't really a viable option.

Of course it doesn't in the general case, but this system in particular is very sensitive to differences in the nodeist. If the transaction maker chooses a different node list (of any node on the network) than the transaction verifier, the verification will fail. Since DHT networks will not generally produce a consistent node list, it is extremely likely something unmentioned is being done to ensure consistency here. Obviously this doesn't mean that this is a secure method, but must be _something_ that does this.

@_date: 2014-09-19 18:47:27
I'm not sure what you mean. The Bitcoin network isn't susceptible to the same sort of DoS attacks as the ones here because it lacks the masternodes. The issue is that you are making nodes, essentially at random, into weak points, which don't exist at all in Bitcoin. So instead of the attacker having to DoS the whole network as they do in Bitcoin, in this system only the weakest of the 10 chosen masternodes must be DoSed.

Firstly, in the unlikely event it is a conspiracy, _the people allegedly orchestrating it are conducting the trial_. This means that even if you're right, your money is wasted.
Secondly, the government verifiably obtained the Silk Road coins. So basically you have four options: 1) Ross is guilty, as _all_ evidence indicates. 2) The US government was running Silk Road all along, and decided to shut it down randomly and pin it on Ross for some unfathomable reason. 3) The government shut down the Silk Road and found the owner, but decided not to prosecute them for unknown reasons, and instead pin it on Ross. 4) The government was able to shut down the Silk Road and obtain the coins, but unable to find the owner. To prevent looking incompetent, they pinned it on Ross.
Really only  and  are at all plausible, and it seems _really, really_ unlikely that they would trust DPR to keep quiet about something like that, so aside from a vast conspiracy for which you have absolutely no evidence, could apply to literally every crime, has no motive, and which you couldn't fight even if you did have evidence, Ross is guilty, and you have wasted your money donating to the defense of a wannabe murderer who, most importantly, _didn't bother to encrypt a hundred fucking million dollars_ (which he never cared to give any of to charity, by the way).

I can't easily think of such a system, though it's possible one exists. If you have a design for it it is necessary to publish that, because without it the system falls apart. Also it would be helpful to describe your method of keeping node lists synchronised, because that's also a pretty difficult to do as well.
Also, even with this extension, the probability that the instant confirmations feature will be successfully intentionally DoSed in a given period is (slightly more than) `1-((tm-a)/tm)^10`, where `tm` is total masternodes and `a` is the number of nodes controlled by *any* DoSing attacker (they need not be colluding). This means that, in a system with 1000 total potential masternodes, of which just 10 are attacker controlled, instant confirmations will be unavailable around 10% of the time.

It is very much not the same thing. In Bitcoin, an attacker has little (though nonzero, as evidenced by these modifications) incentive to attack any particular node because it will not greatly affect the functionality of the network. In your system, the ability of an attacker to DoS the network reduces to the ability to DoS the weakest masternode at a given time. So instead of all attacks being spread over the network and having to overload the whole thing like in Bitcoin, they can concentrate all that firepower on the masternodes and only have to get one.
It's like if you're winning a war and suddenly you decide to move your C&amp;C center to the backback of the weakest of 10 randomly selected frontline soldiers, announce who this guy is and then and claim you haven't reduced your chances of victory because most if your frontline soldiers were doing ok before the policy so he's definitely gonna do fine. See the issue?

One issue I think that may become quite serious in the near future is Bitcoin kidnappings. With a regular kidnapping, by far the hardest part is getting the money safely, but with Bitcoin, that will be made much easier and ring many fewer bells. Combined with the number of people with new money in Bitcoin and the fact that many transactions can be geolocated and the owner's balances discerned, I get the feeling that this may be a pretty major problem with wider adoption.

The banks themselves had their accounts seized. (Whether or not this was a good idea is irrelevant to the issue of the security of the funds.) Most customer funds in the EU would be protected from theft by government insurance (which is not a guarantee), except by governments themselves through garnishment, etc, which is common place enough I can't find anything more than vague references to it in Sweden, probably because I don't speak Swedish. (Again, moral and legal legitimacy of the actions is irrelevant. The fact remains that funds were transferred without consent.)

The problem with low probabilities is people are really bad at reasoning  about them. The chance of surviving for a long period without cryogenics is non-zero. As I pointed out, the chance of any occurence in the real world is non-zero. The chance that Heaven exists, everyone goes there, but when people are cryonically resurrected their souls are pulled out and barred from re-entry, and then when they die forced to a Hell which exists only for them.
"But that doesn't happen! It violates all known physical laws and there's no reason to consider that as a hypothesis in the first place." Of course this is correct, but the probability of this being true is still not zero. Now you may say I'm being pedantic: cryogenics isn't just non-zero, it's downright plausible!
Well... is it? For people to be succesfully resurrected, many conditions must be met:
1. It must be physically possible to do, i.e. the brain doesn't store information in a way that will be lost when it's cryogenically frozen. I have no idea how likely this is, but it seems quite plausible. So to start, there's a good chance cryonics will just never work even if you do get a singularity at some point.
2. People must want to revive you. This doesn't seem too implausible, but it probably depends on how expensive it is to do, but it's still reasonably high.
3. You must want to be revived. Well, ok, this isn't actually a condition, but it should still factor into your analysis. It's possible the future you awaken in is really, really bad. You could have post-humans experimenting on you for eternity to look forward to. This is plausible, but pretty unlikely.
4. The technology to revive cryogenically frozen people must be developed at some point. This is probably the most unlikely thing here. The technological advances required to do this are literally unthinkable. It's an incredibly huge chasm that looks pretty damn near uncrossable.
5. The company will not go out of business prior to the development of resurrection technology; or, someone else will take over the (expensive) maintenance of your frozen state. This is also extraordinarily unlikely. Almost all companies will fail. The success of a company is a very fragile thing, and here it's looked at over a long timescale. The probability of failure is basically exponential with time. Society as a whole views cryogenics as quackery, so it seems pretty unlikely the government will pick up the tab. And private individuals have no motivation to do so, and it wouldn't be viewed by the public as a worthy cause.
6. You must not be unlucky. The chance of your body being made unrecoverable increases greatly the longer you're stored. Fire, natural disaster, war, incompetence, malice, and technical failure could all do you in. Your body has a really good chance of getting unfrozen prematurely at some point in the indefinite future.
Now, you might concede all this, but tell me the expected reward is still really huge! You'll live forever in a magic post-singularity world, right? Well, no, probably not.
1. The technology to revive people probably won't make you immortal. Your expected lifespan assuming you are revived is probably a lot less than you'd think. For example, you could be in an accident that destroyed your brain irrecoverably. This drastically decreases expect reward.
2. Even if it does, species-ending catastrophes are basically inevitable in the long run. You're almost certainly not actually getting immortality.
3. You might well have brain damage. When you are revived, it won't necessarily be quite as you were. This is also really likely.
So basically you have to compare the expected value of what you get (really, really low considering how incredibly unlikely it is you will get anything at all) with the cost of cryonics (really high unless you're ultrawealthy). It's basicslly Pascal's Waget for atheists.

This is false. Bitcoin connections are easily identifiable through traffic analysis, and so can be blocked. You can tunnel Bitcoin over Tor, but the protocol sends a lot of data in a fairly unique stream, so while I've never actually attempted it, it would be surprising if it was difficult to identify someone running a full node, even over Tor, and of course Tor itself is easily identifiable when used without using pluggable transports, and a repressive regime would likely ban that anyway.
If you do use pluggable transports with Tor, it will likely be more difficult, but if the government is willing to invest in more capable censorship hardware and the manpower to write new detection code every time a new transport plugin is released, I suspect it may be nearly impossible to really obfuscate a full node.
SPV verification, on the other hand, is low bandwidth enough that it probably can be done through an obfuscated channel, but those are really quite difficult to set up in the first place, and there are currently no public systems with strong obfuscation really available.
That said, I am not aware of any country which has actually attempted to ban Bitcoin connections in practice.
@_date: 2015-04-13 15:01:55
Unfortunately, you can analyse the frequency, size, and timing of packets to easily overcome those protections. Obfuscation is actually really hard; if you are interested in the subject I suggest looking at Freehaven's [excellent compilation]( of papers on this and other subjects.

The same argument is applicable (actually much more applicable, since the set of people who have the ability to do this is vastly larger) to the standard PKI that TLS uses, and for the most part, root certificate compromises have been pretty rare events.

@_date: 2015-11-22 11:49:41
That's not actually true, though - you can create algorithms with backdoors accessible only to specific entities, and the NSA actually did this with NIST curves. I find it a bit odd that this line is repeated so often given that it's easily demonstrated to be false.
@_date: 2015-11-22 12:12:32
Some ciphers, like [DUAL_EC_DRBG](
 (which was in fact backdoored by the NSA in this way), can have backdoors keyed to certain values during the creation of the algorithm, so that no one without knowledge of these values can exploit the backdoor.
That the backdoor exists (or could exist) is detectable, of course, but that's irrelevant if this is a national policy and doesn't lead to any sort of weakness against an adversary who doesn't know those secret values.
And rather trivially, you can just encrypt the symmetric key to the "good guy"'s public key in addition to the recipient's, which obviously does not introduce any new vulnerabilities.
