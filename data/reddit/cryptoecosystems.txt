Hahha idiots! This is like the 1930’s all over again! Turn in your gold for paper notes! Laughing my fucking ass off! Turn in your private keys for Fidelity custodian holding.

Yeah I like how Amazon “crushed expectations”  but only had 2 billion in profit. That’s like me say my rental property was expecting $3,000 and made $6,000 and the house was valued at $500 million. Agreed valuations simply have to come down. All theses lazy investors are going to come back from summer vacation with 20% less in their stock portfolios. Yeah Bitcoin is actually the safer play.
