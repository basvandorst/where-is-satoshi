Another example is India sending money OUT of there.
You must have an invoice, and proof of income where the funds came from in order to send a wire. Since this is so much hassle and scrutiny from the government almost no Indians send bank wires. It's ridiculously expensive and only for the ultra rich who can bribe bank officers.
That's why shitty payment systems like Paypal (which bans Indian users arbitrarily because of 'high risk') and Skrill and Alert Pay/Paysius are used there so much. Now with bitcoins they can avoid those high fee centralized payment systems and send directly to anybody they want on earth and no government knows about it. As long as the guy on the other end cashes it right away, he avoid the bitcoin 'flash crash' and normally you get more money than what was sent because the value goes up. No so much today though

Not if you use an FX middleman like Transferwise.com sometimes it's same day funding, or XEtrade. Note.. sometimes. Seems an arbitrary holding time of 0 minutes to 2 days.I go to this place VBCE.ca and pay cash at the counter and they send a wire right away. Your bank can do this too, then it's instant clear because you didn't send it online.
Also the price could crash for a week that's what happened in 2011

It's a decentralized currency with impossible methods to pay in and out because banks deny every method. This has happened many times, big deal.
When exchanging is more decentralized then this won't be a problem with one site controlling the exchange rate subject to goxxing and ddos. I usually don't keep bitcoins anyways I accept payment for software and then cash them out within 2 minutes I never lose money, certainly pay less fees than credit card companies charge me.
Plus nobody is investing their life savings into bitcoin. The Dotcom bubble people lost everything

Note, you can work on source for Bitcoin, but you aren't the 'creator' thus not responsible for everything that happens on the block chain. Ripple guys not so lucky, they are on the hook for everything that happens in Ripple.

bitcoin is fine, the exchanges aren't because people use weak passwords, don't use 2factor ID, and have computers that are zombied by botnets who are recording every keystroke.
should also encrypt your wallet. I use multibit and electrum wallets, multibit because you can encrypted backup and drop in blockchan.info ewallets.

MtGox has claimed they use Shamir's secret sharing and offline cold wallets for 98% of customer funds. Somebody has to access that wallet to send transactions and that person is probably in the Gox office. If they aren't, they are a phonecall away for a ransom demand.

I hope your backup wallet 'in the cloud' is encrypted.If not I'd generate a new address right now and send all coins to it, then backup new encrypted wallet.
Your old backup would still work, except it's a year old and any new keys you generated would obviously not be there. Technically you should backup the wallet after every transaction which is what I do with a hot wallet I keep on blockexplorer.info that makes one click encrypted backup easy. Rest is kept in cold storage using Armory on a non networked drive

This is true. Think about advantages of bitcoin, and ignore all the speculation bullshit investment schemes and silly Chicago school economist idealogues hating on decentralized cryptocurrency.
**Anonymous worldwide money transfer** No limit money transfer across the world with no ID, no government intervention, no fees if you do it properly using localbitcoins.com .. Argentina with their export fiat controls are helpless with bitcoin. So is Italy trying to control cash, so is the embargo against Iran. Anybody in Tehran can buy bitcoins locally and transfer money to get around bullshit embargo. 
**Universal currency to trade in**
Since you can convert bitcoin to any other currency, you can buy them locally and then spend online without being ripped off by 3% bank currency conversion fees. Try being an Indian funding a paypal account with rupees, paying fee to convert, and then paying for something online in USD. Also good luck trying to cash paypal if you're in India, Pakistan or half the world basically which is blacklisted.
**Impossible for governments to seize** You can encrypt and hide your private keys anywhere. There is no physical safe, bag of cash, or bank safety deposit box for governments or corrupt cops to steal.
**Merchant liberation** Now a guy in Algeria can accept bitcoins for payment for whatever he's selling online, and then get paid out locally without any interference or bullshit denial by paypal and credit card companies. If you can write software in Moldova, Somalia, or even Myanmar you can now support yourself as an online merchant without being denied by all the corporations monopoly over fiat payment systems. If the NRA wants they can use bitcoin to sell weapons because it's decentralized and there's no rules.
**Enabling true escrow** Bitcoin is perfect for refunds if something goes wrong. You can even enable multisig escrow where nobody will benefit if a scam takes place, taking all the motivations of scamming out of the equation. Unless both parties agree to sign the coins to transfer then nobody get's paid. 
This doesn't even include all the altcoins potential benefits, like secure voting systems, namecoin for domains that can't be shutdown or censored, or even the spinoff business of bitcoin like creating your own bitcoin backed digital currency that can be used for mobile payments, since you wouldn't want to trust a mobile OS with bitcoin wallets. This would be for non anonymous everyday payments, but they are backed by bitcoin which means the entire world can use your mobile payment system.

True that is why shady people typically will purchase internet sim card from blackmarket means like on craigslist with cash or online with bitcoins, connect to their own VPN with it, then from there they would proxy chain through various countries. They would throw away these proxies after every use and after a month ditch that VPS and sim card then get a new one. 
With Tor this is much easier. Launch Tor, then proxy chain exit node. You can buy daily proxies for like $10 for 200 per month or for $0.30/each. There must be a bitcoin proxy vendor somewhere. I think Tails/Amnesic Live CD or dee.su Liberty Linux live CD both come with proxychains installed. Just need to fill them with whatever one's you want. You can also buy RDP, then use JonDoNym behind it. When you open remote browser put in a proxy.

with smartphones you can easily set up a textsecure like encrypted negotiation to send/receive money, so no worries on somebody either stealing the phone and the money, or faking SMS, or intercepting traffic.
problem is most ppl don't have them in africa so stuck with just regular clear text sms. you could do telephone bitcoin banking though but minutes cost $$ unless they are all voip phones. 
another option is a bitcoin backed mobile currency like pecunix but for phones.that can be redeemed for bitcoins if needed, and is some scheme (ripple?) that quickly confirms, is secure, and has withdrawal controls and 2FA then attacker doesn't directly get all the coveted BTC coins if he spoofs or steals the phone.

M Pesa is an insecure closed source centralized system not involving any crypto signing of transactions. It's a micro payment method using SMS all run out of a central server. They're only using it for like max $100 because anybody can clone, steal or borrow your phone and use it to send themselves money. You can also easily pop SMS stacks and spoof text messages to fraud this system, but the average transaction is like $1 so not worth it

Nope, because the excited states of America goes after foreigners who trade with Americans and don't comply with FinCEN regs. This is a new thing that just started.
So if you invented Ripple coin and lived in Sweden, if American's are using it to transfer money you now have to register with Fincen. Not joking, that's how stupid the laws are now. That's why MtGox had to partner with Coinlab and stop doing MtGoxUSD even though they are in Japan.

bitcoin isn't like anything else. it's sort of like gold and other commodities but not because there isn't a gigantic demand for electronic worldwide instant money transfers with gold. gold can't do multisig transactions leading to all new sorts of innovative payment and escrow methods. it's also decentralized and immune to any government interference it can still easily be traded on the underground. you don't have to carry bitcoins around to pay for things or get a vault to store your coins the government can seize.

Fractional reserve banking is considered foolish by most of the world yet we do it anyways. Ask Cyprus, Greece, Argentina, Spain, Italy, and US how well that worked out for them. 
Printing money into the sky through a central bank is also an insane policy. I bet it costs more to run the central bank and printing presses/security storage than the energy cost of mining bitcoins. My government gives the central bank 500 million per year to operate and pay salaries of endless technocrats and middle managers just to print a bunch of worthless paper.
There's also a finite amount of bitcoins. After that no more will be mined and this argument of expending resources is moot. Plus it was the best method to bootstrap bitcoin. Nobody would use it if Satoshi had premined everything with no difficulty and just flooded scamcoins or floated some electronic currency out of thin air

No because people will notice on the network if BFL or Avalon started mining themselves with the pre-sales miners. The TH/s would skyrocket and somebody is going to notice this.
Maybe they are using customer rigs to mine on a few ascis. You could technically fly a bit under the radar and do this pocketing all the money your customers should be getting if you actually shipped to them
As for BFL they don't even have a working prototype let alone a chance to fraud the customers yet by mining themselves

It should be noted all these same arguments happened when Tor first appeared, and Tor was originally a DARPA funded project. Everybody claimed the feds would buy up all the nodes and do timing attacks, or a giant DoS to shut it down, but low and behold: it never happened. 
Governments won't kill bitcoin just like they haven't killed Tor, or haven't bombed tax shelters in BVI to stop the flow of tax income offshore. You can't just immediately get thousands of ASIC miners there's a year long wait, and by then so many people will have them mining their own pools jacking up the difficulty it would cost countless money for any government to R&amp;D, produce and especially power their own massive ASIC farm to overtake the existing blockchains with their own. This would be noticed immediately by the network, and Bitcoin can just fork itself to exclude those blockchains and DDoS the miners. They have to connect to the network somehow

I'm interested in their cold wallet management, I wouldn't trust them for the actual exchange that's what functional programming in haskell/lisp and openbsd pf firewalls are for.
Interested as in what sort of system they use to do multisig transactions and protect the wallet, yet find a way to semi automate transfers.What is to prevent stealing by snooping network admins going into console as well. 
Those fees are stupid though. You want us to pay PER MONTH and then not make any money from the exchange because you're charging 1% fee? No exchange charges that much. You might as well start a credit card merchant processing account with those fees. And I consider this vaporware because there's zero whitepapers detailing security they've implemented.

Turns out Satoshi had a good reason to remain anonymous, according to FinCen he's liable for all of bitcoin for having been it's 'creator' and since he doesn't have an MSB license or compliance officer to report on every single coin that's being spent in the entire blockchain (as creator of the virtual currency), he's at risk of going to jail forever. 
"The guidance pulled no punches with respect to a “creator” of a de-centralized virtual currency. The creator of Bitcoin, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, falls squarely within these rules to the extent he is “a person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency”.

Paypal, Credit cards, Debit Cards, EFT, Moneybookers, AlertPay (whatever it's called now) any system which has a potentially reversible option can't be used to buy bitcoins. If you want to fraud Paypal buy something, then phone them a month later and say your kid authorized the charge while you were out of the room and presto: transaction reversed, seller is screwed. 
However there are some people crazy enough to risk it, but they charge high enough fees to cover the fraud losses. That is until Paypal seizes their account for breaking TOS
 let's you pay small amounts with paypal to buy second life money, then you convert it to BTC but they may have stopped SLL-&gt;Bitcoin methods because of fraud.

There is no such thing.
All VPNs do logging. The only way you can guarantee security is make your own VPN. Ignore this at your peril, look up 'Shadowcrew VPN' it was a fed agent and snitch run VPN that decrypted traffic and got hundreds of people busted. Also look up problems Topiary had with VPNs handing over his logs.
What you do is find OpenVZ VPS that accepts bitcoins. OpenVZ because it's much harder to perform forensics on to retrieve deleted data. The NSA used it for their Command &amp; Control servers to operate malware like Fuse/Stuxnet
Now set up your vpn (through Tor) using online tutorials. Google 'debian vpn' or whatever Linux distro you're using. Google how to lock down Iptables for just VPN/SSH traffic. apt-get remove any packages not needed. You could also do this on an free tier amazon ec2 instance but there would be logs of somebody connecting and leaving their infrastructure. 
Thankfully the NSA left a little bash script lying around called 'LogWiper.sh' on one of servers. After you set up the vpn, sudo run it to nuke all logging forever. Just google the filename
The only decent alternative to this is **JonDoNym a mixmaster network** that has no logs, but if they receive a court order to all 3 mixmasters (in different countries) then they have to monitor the next time you log in. Bonus is that they tell everybody when LE is looking for people.
They also accept bitcoins and are pretty fast:   ... JonDoNym also has a Live CD for free you can use to lock down your traffic.
Failing that  There's lot's of 'EliteVPN' and 'QuadVPN' which supposedly routes your traffic through 4 different hops but they scream federal honeypot

Not a bubble. Bitcoin is actually undervalued
You have a worldwide usable decentralized e-currency/commodity that has no central authority with more and more people accepting it for payment everyday. African nations are considering using Bitcoin for state currency to avoid their rapid inflation. Zimbabwe could switch today and be more stable than their current next to worthless banknotes.
Bitcoin has to increase in value in order for the world to use it. If you want to trade billions with it in exports/imports to China/US avoiding the gigantic bank fees then each bitcoin is going to have to be worth at least $1,000 for this to work.

If there's one address with no IP because it was generated offline, or through tor/i2p, and bitcoins go through it they are no longer connected to you. Nobody can prove you own that address unless they seize your system and find the private keys, for which you used full disc encryption so impossible.
Bitcoins heists were most likely cashed. People lost track of the bitcoinica heist or theft ages ago when it went to thousands of different addresses and pool to launder the coins. You can also buy coins from a mining pool with zero history.

Problems with this site:
- there is a fiat money trail for timing analysis unless they are aware of this and doing delayed buys over multiple online brokerage accounts to split up transactions
- they are obviously buying all the securities in THEIR name, you have to trust they don't disappear with a million worth of gold stocks
- already noticed some OPSEC blown by them you need very disciplined OPSEC to pull off a successful longterm Tor hidden service. 
- OTR rating?
- they are clearly miners, because they hashed their own custom .onion (you wouldn't risk paying somebody else and having them impersonate/clone your .onion)
- anybody who takes the insurance fee and holds it in trust will get a fist rammed up their ass by the Secret Service and SEC thugs
- already found some tiny DDOS attack vectors for the site I'll tell them about
If you wanted to set this up yourself just get a swissquote account or some other online brokerage using anonymous methods and then exchange bitcoins to USD directly into their account, or set up your own Poland bank account for dirt cheap using scanned incorporation docs and buy all the securities you want. Since there are so many tax breaks involved with investments, what's the point in doing this anonymously. What did Mitt Romney pay on his taxes again? Nothing. In fact you would save money buying stocks with bitcoins because then you wouldn't have to declare any bitcoin income, it'd all be written off through your investments.
There is also really no reason to use Tor when you can buy a Panama Financial Services company for that 1,000 BTC they offered as insurance, and legally do trades for the public taking bitcoins.

It's definitely legal, as long as you don't do business in USA with Americans you don't have to pay sales or any income tax. I report all my income to the IRS and nothing has happened, but I'm not American and I don't live in USA. 
For Americans, incorporate in the Seychelles or Belize/Panama where they do not require any income tax filing is a tried and true method that's been done for decades.It's not illegal nor has it even been illegal to incorporate in a taxless area it's only illegal if you start withdrawing personal money from it and don't declare.
In my country I declare my Oregon LLC that pays no US tax and use it to rent my apartment, lease a car, phone contracts and even bought a mining rig with it. Paid an accountant to make it all legit and I reported it all to the tax authorities in my country, who rubber stamped every year for 6 yrs. Good to go. My personal income tax is a joke because I pay myself out enough to eat that's it.Technically I'm not 'defrauding' my country either, they get all their sales taxes when I lease cars and buy computer hardware.

You should incorporate, and pay as little LEGAL tax as possible. That way they can't come after you. The entire system is setup so corporations don't pay fuck all so take advantage and either incorporate in Delaware, Oregon tax free LLC, or incorporate offshore.
You still have to report personal income but big deal. Keep most of it in the corporation and buy everything with it, including housing, computer eq, phones ect. You could easily avoid taxes with bitcoins but it's a risk you don't necessarily need to do when everything has been designed to favor corps and investments anyways.

Notice how hardly none of the online gold dealers sell gold for credit cards or soft bank transfers like EFTs either.If they take cards it's a tiny limit and you have to phone in the order and confirm a lot of things
They are also making multi millions of dollars in profits and can afford to eat the lower risk fraud like your bank does. Banks eat so much fraud only 1/4 of it is reported because they don't want you to think the bank is insecure, so they just eat it and pretend nothing happened. If those forex exchanges sold bitcoins they'd be cleaned out in 24hrs

SR has an option where most of dealers click to protect the price. So SR will guarantee the price all through escrow. So if bitcoins shoot up to $1000/coin then SR keeps all that extra coin and pays you out just for what the $USD value was. 
Of course as a dealer you have an option to gamble and escrow the coins all to yourself but a drug dealer can't afford to lose money on shipped drugs if there's a flash crash of bitcoins, usually they are already in hock to some dealer up the ladder who's fronted them the drugs. Sadly drug dealers are idiots and always use credit to get themselves killed, ratted out or screwed.
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:02:52
you overestimate the business intelligence of drug dealers. there's plenty of drug addicts on SR who are obviously barely surviving off selling enough to support their own habit, they're all over the forums crying over the smallest fees, refusing to reship just $50 worth of product, ect. or they are blowing it on swag for themselves and not keeping enough reserve.
you could make thousands per day on SR if you never touched your own product, were reliable and not a clown. that's like 20% of vendors imho which is why the top 10 guys get rich while the rest have average sales

No reason you can't just take the open source gribble code and write your own apis, make your own decentralized IRC server and host it. Even on Tor. Nobody will trust your ratings though.
No reason you can't write a front end to the existing bot, where people GPG authenticate with it using a phone app and leave each other ratings. A secure ratings system is difficult to do, because it can be frauded easily. If you're just relying on passwords alone for ratings that's useless when a botnet admin comes along under somebody else's account and starts frauding using their good rating. With gribble you can't do that: gpg authentication prevents it unless of course, botnet get's your PGP password which is unlikely but possible.

there were plenty of exchanges in Australia at one point then disappeared through self-goxxing. remember cryptoxchange? 
technocash is also wary of bitcoin and doesn't want anybody to use them for BTC transactions, basically gox fucked this up for all australians when they got banned by technocash. you can get around this by making up a fake game gold card called DERPGOLD with it's own website and then sell that for technocash AUD. have your exchange accept 'DerpGold' as a payment method and link to your other site. win

The difference is a guy who owns a botnet with 1,000 bank logins can't cash out on itunes or Amazon unless he has a network of people to receive stolen goods. With Bitcoin he can now get untraceable money, so since you can rent a botnet for only $100/hr the world's scammers would flock to such a site and scam it into it's grave
EDIT: No payment processor allows for exchanging with 'digital currency' either, so such a site wouldn't even exist because no bank would touch it for fraud risk.

The problem is MtGox market share, er monopoly. Because they are the most used exchange anything that goes wrong there impacts the trading value of bitcoins. A 12 minute lag to sell because bots are running rampant and the php trading engine is pure shit, causes panic selling.
When mtgox isn't the  exchange won't make a difference what kind of problems they have. Stop using it, cavirtex.ca is a good exchange with zero problems so far, stable pricing too. Bitstamp.eu is starting to get rep as well for being a good responsible exchange.

Reason it's difficult to pay into exchanges is because
* Banks hate digital currency and tend to seize accounts that use it. This includes Liberty Reserve exchangers they get screwed sometimes too sending legit transactions. They also don't like doing free or low cost SEPA transfers and will dump you if you're doing too many of them. They're not supposed to do this but of course do it anyways. They want you to use swift and cough up a ton of percentage of the transfer to some shitty correspondent bank that did nothing except have their automated system send a message to the next bank.
* Banks use an easy to fraud system that is especially dangerous if you're taking flimsy online soft bank transfers for untraceable, non refundable bitcoins. You can buy bank account logins on fraud forums or rent your own botnet and harvest logins so not holding funds until they clear is dangerous for sellers.
* Due to shitty government regulation and monopoly of money transfer licenses in some countries you can't get a bank account at all to trade, so have to use only virtual money like Vircurex does. No direct payments so they don't have to take ID and hire compliance officers to report everything.

- Start Tor
- Get new blockchain.info wallet
- Receive bitcoins to it.
- Generate new wallet with Electrum (over tor).
- Transfer coins to it, then pay SR.
- Delete and overwrite electrum.dat and wipe system logs 
Encrypt your HD. How is anybody going to prove you didn't sell those coins to somebody random in person using localbitcoins or on the internet. They can't. You should have pre-generated the Tor addresses to avoid timing attack and connected using obfsproxy. Now that middle address is a ghost. As long as one step between buying coins, and paying SR there is reasonable doubt. It's perfectly reasonable to assume if you sell your own bitcoins tied to you in person to somebody from  localbitcoins that they turn right around and fund an SR account. 
There's also bitcoinfog or dropping coins in and out of an exchange. Chain proxy to end of Tor exit node so nobody sees you're using Tor and filters the traffic. I think there's also a Tor instawallet but nobody trusts it, software is open source

If you absolutely must sell via Paypal, the only 'safe' way to do it is buy those cheap reloadable prepaid visa cards that come with IBAN/ACH loading and internet access to check blocked card amount for PP verification. Now you remove funds to card and withdraw directly from ATM.
When somebody buys bitcoins from you, you withdraw the funds to card and don't send the coins until you have cash in your hand. If Paypal freezes your account you then just get a new prepaid card and start over. 
Paypal can take money out of your bank account if you're an American/Canadian so be careful attaching it to your bank. I've seen it happen when I worked for them ~6yrs ago some guitar seller went postal when he shipped a wholesale shipment to a scammer and the charges were reversed, and Paypal yoinked it from his BoA account. Scammer was never seen again, ran off with the guitars. Scammer used a stolen account he got probably by renting a botnet for an hour and capturing logins and the orig owner didn't notice until a month later, had the fraud reversed. Guitar seller threatened to sue nothing ever happened because he had no leg to stand on with Paypal's army of lawyers waving around the TOS that says fraudulent charges may be reversed anytime.

Well depends, are you Julian Assange and the entire world's governments are after you? If so I wouldn't recommend this. I would recommend Tor using obfsproxy  
If you just want to keep away from standard MITM and snoop attacks this Pi setup will work fine except I don't really like the logmein part, or enabling SSH without using keys  but generally that will do. 
You can also just use free AWS/Amazon EC2 Tier to set up an occasional VPN. Can buy a virtual visa to register using bitcoins. Set up OpenVPN and just copy keys to your phone/laptop. JonDoNym works on Android too.
A VPN is just to encrypt traffic to prevent ISP or somebody evil on wifi from sniffing your traffic. It provides confidentiality. It doesn't provide anonymity whatsoever. Tor, I2p, these provide relative anonymity. 
The home VPN would be pretty slow, if it's not for mission critical escaping from embassy and defecting to Ecuador Julian Assange level COMSEC then you can always rent a service: 
Remember, even though they say 'oh we don't keep logs' it's BS. Somewhere there are logs. Their VPN application might not keep logs but the firewall in and out of their servers will, or there's some sort of usage meter to determine how much traffic you're using. That's a log that can be analyzed. Also keep in mind any VPN provider in EU has to comply with shit EU data retention requirements regardless of their no log statement. So don't do anything requiring ultra anonymity instead use Tor.

It will get cheaper and cheaper as more people use localbitcoins.com
If you know what you're doing on IRC you can exchange for 1:1 rate too 
The  benefit to bitcoins is if you do it properly (p2p exchange) there's no ID no tracking no government no limits and no bullshit funds freezing or arbitrary authority you have to submit to. You can go on localbitcoins.com in Tehran Iran and send it to your cousin in UK if you wanted and he then cashes out the same way: selling on localbitcoins. Nobody ever knows where the coins came from and no bullshit economic embargo that crushes the people and not the despotic government in charge stops them from transferring money.

I hope bitfloor does survive and pays off all their creditors who lost BTC when the owner left the site wallet lying around unencrypted and it was stolen. 
This is becoming unlikely though, I think he's paid back 1000 BTC that's it.So operating at a loss I couldn't afford to do that for a few years.

There's also other US exchanges like CampBX or Bitfloor

They would get screwed by being forced to get msb licenses and hire compliance officers. Visa can get away with this because they are already msb, so store is allowed to do it when at least somebody has an msb in the process, in this case Visa reports the transaction on their behalf. 
So you would have to use storefront currency exchange places unless it was just trivial $50 amounts.
