It's funny to watch the reps in the U.S. Gov. hootin' and holler'n as-if they're going to be able to do anything to stop it.

Yes, you're learning. That's why to pick only one to bet on. When one eats it you have to manually sell them all. Unless you're running some automation.

Government is obsolete. It's unable to keep up with all of the changes going on. Thank God, crypto is decentralized. There's nothing they can do to stop it.

Fuck anything that requires KYC. That was never a planned requirement for using crypto. Do not use any service that requires KYC. Either way, a service provider will use your information to screw you.
@_date: 2019-07-30 05:20:45
You should have never complied with KYC to begin with. I love how everyone used to down-vote others to hell when warning others to not comply with KYC, and now you're all learning a lesson.

I'd love to see it stay right around there, and then people start using it more often to make purchases. I want to see the banks become obsolete - so much.

It didn't break $20,000 this year though. I would lay the blame on Trump's administration spooking it. Every time he tweets anything about Bitcoin, then it eats it. Ugh.. Come on. The US Gov. can't do shit about its existence, Just ignore them.
Edit: Of course, Trump does not directly change the price of Bitcoin. It's the people who invest... SMH.

Why convert Bitcoin to cash when it is already cash ;)
Just start using Bitcoin and forget the banks.
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:00:32
It's Bitcoin. Just don't report it. People only pay taxes because they choose to pay taxes with Bitcoin.

Well, sorry but Bitcoin has been ready for a long time already, and it's not centralized.
@_date: 2019-08-13 04:41:17
Yes, it's not much of a stretch. It's increasingly difficult to find value in coming to read posts on Reddit. There's a constant need to correct so many people.
@_date: 2019-08-02 08:06:43
I love the fact that crypto is like an well armored hydra. Even if they could succeed in cutting off a head, then two more will grow to replace it.

Yeah, that's interesting that Venezuelans are jumping on board. I'd like to see wide spread adoption of it in Venezuela to see if it can completely turn around that country's situation.
@_date: 2019-08-12 13:57:38
Not now... lol It's about to go down for a few days.
@_date: 2019-08-09 14:31:04
Oh, it's going to be the first soon enough.
@_date: 2019-08-26 01:32:56
I don't think so, but we'll see. I am waiting. What goes up must come down.
@_date: 2019-08-11 03:18:06

Because he is owned by the MSM, and he's being paid to say that. Or they're just creating deep fakes at will because they own rights to his likeness. I've seen a video of him, and it looks like something is very wrong. You don't really need to have the person sit in front of the camera anymore.

Okay, you would love to live in a garbage world which you might be able to do so soon. Don't worry tough guy, you'll be crying later.

I'm wondering about when there's barely any bitcoin left to mine, then what's going to be the incentive for miners to continue mining and processing the transactions? Is the transaction fee enough incentive to continue?

Your mistake is that you dealt with an organized crime syndicate: a bank. Please God, people learn your lesson about dealing with a bank and stop. What did you expect from them?
@_date: 2019-08-23 09:46:17
Don't use BitPay. I've had my Bitcoin lost through them too. Fortunately, it was a very small amount.
@_date: 2019-08-03 02:39:26
It's money. Period. Start using it as such and ignore the banks.
