sounds fun but really think it through. Nack in the day an old software company had an online scavenger hunt that they swore would be difficult to solve . It took the people 15 minutes to figure it out. Also make sure you have permits and what not because you can bet the worst will come out.

Quick question, how do you feel about the lack of public acknowledgement from some/most of the recipients?  2 million given via btc should at very least deserve a blog post or a FB shout out but I can't find much of anything publicly saying thanks.

Possibly but again for an OFAC flag to appear it takes more than a suspicious name. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:16:11
C'mon man No one is going that route. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 13:46:38
Don't think that this is a normal thing. it is an OFAC scan.   this scan is a net that catches any customers that reside in countries under current embargoes or other bad places the US can not do biz with. It is not something used willy nilly. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:03:50
Ohhh child you have a lot to learn. let me know when you have taken the wool off your eyes. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:19:59
Well OP did they respond? I bet they reminded you about your ties to Iran.  C'mon OP apologize and move on. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:22:30
This has nothing to do with bitcoin, this is an issue with OP and Coinbase. Coinbase is a US compnay which has to follow OFAC rules. Meaning no business with anyone on the OFAC shitlist. Somehow OP is associated with that shit list(ties to IRAN) and coinbase legally can not do business with him. It is simple. It would be the same for you if you tried to deal with OP and he tried to sell you a bridge. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 18:01:55
If you read the rest of my comments you will see that I have already explained this.

@_date: 2015-05-05 14:11:25
No it is an issue with his ties to Iran. OP is not telling the full story. OFAC scans are rarely false. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 14:34:16
So all you did was creep on them and take a pic. Dang you missed a golden opportunity to slip in and strike up a conversation. Its VEGASSSSS  you could have been getting your freak on.

Ohhh pleaseee. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:25:14
Nothing to do with OP being any nationality. Everything to do with OP doing some sort of bi with a Iranian company or some other business. Same would happen to you if you were OP. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 17:58:25
Do what you want, no one is forcing you to use them. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:31:58
Go ahead and try, those other non-us countries have similar lists and will can your ass for what ever reason they want. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:18:12
Ain't that the truth!!! 
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:14:42
Some of us have worked in an industry that have to run these scans very diligently.  The only time I have seen them come up false or with an issue is where a system saw Iran but failed to notice that the person was in a small province of Iran that was actually allowed. Weird but the customer laughed and said it happens all the time but he showed proof and we all laughed and went on our ways.
@_date: 2015-05-06 16:34:14
How about someone put this to a test? Send some Coinbase coin to the same addy and see if the police show up. 
1.2.3. Not it
@_date: 2015-05-05 13:44:25
OFAC scans happen about once a month. OP be straight with Coinbase and talk to them ASAP. This is not a Coinbase thing trying to screw you this is a GOVT thing that all businesses have to abide by. If this scan is false you better have proof.
EDIT added link
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:06:58
probably because of this
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:07:36
NO it is because of this
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:12:45
Correct, however there are issues with any us resident doing business with Iran. No matter if it is bitcoin or selling bananas 
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:18:09
Nope not the case.Just because he is not in Iran does not make it ok. If the money can be traced to Iran in anyway then it is a no no.  Ive seen all types of attempts where OFAC scans would pull up a customer residing in India but sure enough the main company was in some other OFAC shit list country and we had to can them. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:23:31
Nothing to with money. It is aproblem with OFAC and Coinbase. Same problem would pop up if OP tried to get an account with any other US company. An OFAC scan would happen some time after OP signs up then his account would be canned. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 17:46:35
are you serious? Have you signed up for a coinbase account? It takes more than a random email address to get going and to their defense it is needed to protect against everyone loosing their coins. 
Ohh fuck it, you guys are still trying to compare apples to oranges. This has nothing to do with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:28:29
But did OP actually go through with it? Did OP do any other business with an Iranian company or did OP use an email address associatesd with an Iranian Co? We do not know but those are things OFAC scans for among other things like adresses names phone numbers and lots of other things. BTW Argentina is not in the OFAC shitlist.
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:09:49
But you are Iranian and have traveled to Iran and do business with an Iranian co in some capacity, correct or not?  This may be a reason why OFAC scan caught you in its net.  
Edit for a bit more clarity on why OFAc will catch you. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 17:26:55

I have a feeling the Chinese will sell at first to keep thier profits up, prices will drop and so will difficulty but the smart will buy btc driving up demand. Then new faster mining equipment will become available, miners will scramble driving up demand.. yadda  yadda  yadda we have a small blip down by those selling off their homes for faster mining equipment, the smart players will buy ....it's and endless cycle. Well almost endless. Anyways I'm guessing a price of 490 at the half.

call up your lender and ask for a manager. tell them you will pull your loan and go elsewhere if they try to pull that shit. you will see how fast they turn.  they tried that shit with me and I asked for documentation and if they were stating I was laundering, were they willing to go to court for libel.

Ask your grandmother what says? i am willing to bet that she will say satbshi or even sat- b- shi.  It needs to be reworked so that the coin looks more like an O and the B in the bitcoin is just secondary focal point and not the main.

Having worked in an industry filled with cc fraud I can see where CB is trying to win the fight. Sadly they are trusting digital evidence more than gut and physical evidence.  
We use to watch/cross refence  IP adress , names , email addresses, and even flag certain names for "extra scrutiny" and no matter what we did we were always one step behind those commuting fraud. In our industry it was bad if they made it through but in the big picture we just really lost time/electricity and bandwidth but coinbase had a lot to lose. I mean if a fake account makes it through and btc is sent its gone FOREVER no recourse just live and learn. I know this transaction was just ten bucks but I bet Coinbase stopped all big orders for further review and let little orders fly through. The the theives must have caught on and got away with tons of bite size orders. Now Coinbase is back to the drawing board  trying to figure out fraud prevention but I'm betting they are overlooking the single most important tool for fraud verification. A Human.  Get a human to call immediatly when an account is open and talk to the person on the other end. Not about fraud stuff like "what is your name , what is your blood type".  Personable stuff like are you familiar with how the blockchain works? Do you have any plans for accepting btc for your business? How can we help grow together? Pssst Coinbase this type of questioning will reveal two things, new business and a gut feeling. That gut feeling will win at fraud detection over any automated system ever built. 
Hey Coinbase, pm me if you need a consultant. 
Edit spelling

Anyone on this sub from Egypt? If so you two connect and Skype them so your boss can see said Egyptian, pyramids and all. then over Skype have them send you a small amount of btc.  Then you send it back plus a small reward for their help. 
I've always found it very impactful to send some one I'm talking to about btc a small bit of btc as an example of speed and ease of use. With the added visual of an Egyptian sending you btc the point will be driven home rather nicely.
