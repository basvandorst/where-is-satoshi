On top of using 2FA you might also want to understand how works. Because if your phone or computer is compromised (which it is) then so is your 2FA.

I mean literally all of that can easily be obtained once the device in question is compromised. And yeah, I agree, you and I aren't probably huge targets. But maybe your local representative is, and now he's being blackmailed by any random person who got their hands on the CIA's backdoor arsenal. Or maybe even the CIA themselves! 
Regardless of whether you or I will be targeted today, allowing these developments to go without resistance can only hurt us in the future. It doesn't take a whole lot of imagination to see the darkness that this path leads to.

Well I don't really want to spoil anything, but since you said you only watched the first 2 episodes I think it's fair to share some counter points that happen later on in the series. 
~ After they succeed with their anarchistic plan in the first season, many of the characters realize that their idealistic view of the world is extremely simplified and that they were likely better off, as a whole, before they "took down" capitalism. 
~ Many of the "big bad" corporate execs which were demonized earlier in the series, turn out to be completely normal people who's lavish lifestyles detract in no way from their humanization. (With the exception of Pierce who is undoubtedly characterized as an evil capitalist mercenary)
~ Drug use and the criminal activity that proceeds it are shown in extremely poor light. This seems to fall more in line with conservative thinking imo.  
I do agree that the show generally leans leftists, but I think it's at least fair to say they show conservative bias in some places
