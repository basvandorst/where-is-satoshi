If I had to guess, it would be because Bitcoin is tanking. There was a post here the other day about them taking a portion of their paychecks in Bitcoin. 
    
I love Bitcoin to death, but for them to accept and hold Bitcoin at this moment would be a terrible business decision. Once the drop is over I'm sure it'll be back up.

I want to believe.
How reputable is this company?

Or it may just mean they wiped their systems and are reinstalling their OS, stack, and trading engine. You are trying to glean way too much information from a single sentence.

Nejc Kodric was on HIS WAY TO CES WHEN THIS HAPPENED. Therefore, we can conclude, he was going to be in the booth.
So many buttcoin assumptions in this thread.

This guy knew the amount before anyone yesterday, as far as I know:
I'm inclined to believe him when he says that the cold storage address is the correct one. Coins were still being swept in there as recently as the 5th.
The whole point of cold storage is to NOT have it on your network. The hacker gained access to their hot wallet, not the cold one. 
So rest assured, they have at least ~135k BTC.

Bitcoin is now a decentralized company. The product we create we give to ourselves to sell back to ourselves to fund our own research and development. Brilliant.
The good news is, we are all the boss.

Cool, you don't have to, you can read the open source code.
Wouldn't it be great if you could see the opponent's hand in poker?

Because it can be soft forked and capped wherever. Might as well go big, even if the space is never needed. It allows the softforks to adapt to whatever population size. I think this is the best, simply because bandwidth on the whole might increase at some linear rate, but Bitcoin adoption won't.
Imagine in the future we are at 32 MB blocks. LN comes out and is everything they said it would be. Cool, now blocks aren't filling up as fast. When the block eventually gets too full once again, the limit could be raised without needing a hard fork. Garzik's plan would require a hard fork.
