Taleb was a big reason I didn’t get into crypto earlier. Never too late to get on board though and it was good to see him endorse bitcoin. I take his opinions/musings with a grain of salt these days though.

Bitcoin has definitely succeeded then. You always take the opposite of what Carnage says. Please Canada - take him back.

A house is for living in not for investing. 
I love crypto but I’d rather have my own house any day of the week.
We’re moving to a serf society where only the rentiers make money.

You can tell the price has gone up a little. Haven’t seen so many posts like this since December!

The Guardian re-design was fairly recent. The article might be old but the screenshot is not.
