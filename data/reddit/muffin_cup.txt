Are you suggesting another near future bitcoin crash? 
There's already a bunch of bitcoin regret, bitcoin suicide probably isn't far off

How can bitcoin grow when authoritarian devs refuse to work on scaling issues that work for everyone

My coinbase transaction took the designated week - accurately tells you when the coins hit your account

Sorry for the rash judgement - looks like you might appreciate some extra thoughts. It's just gonna be a stream of consciousness. 
Obviously a big part of bitcoin is decentralization which goes at odds with regulation, but some market manipulation is clearly toxic, especially as market caps grow and more capital is at stake. 
Crypto is still in 'wild wild west' territory as far as regulation is concerned, but I don't think all political action concerning it will be inherently negative (shit like sell walls are banned in many markets, but we let that fly cuz we crypto baby, but where do we draw the line? Insider trading and collusion? Maybe. I hope so. We don't need more mtgoxes) 
Altcoins allow for even more blurred lines and manipulation - a nonzero amount are pyramid schemes, but there's still people trying to peddle herbs, crappy knives, and timeshares to this day. Hell, in USA we still allow predatory microloans! 
Shitecoin scam revolution has just begun! Get your B I T E of bit-light-coin today, now with zero calories! (wall street investors HATE him! Doubled money in just [one unit of time]!) Grandpapps might buy some pyramid-coin off his yahoo toolbar one day. Memecoins got potential! Right? 
Back to regulation / decentralization - I think some regulation will be born from necessity, and it won't be the death of crypto, if anything, embolden or harden it. Big regulation is a wildcard at the end of the day, though. We could reference plenty of regulatory failures, which is one of my favorite economic topics honestly, especially prudent to SEC. 
Reading some of your other responses, sounds like you are pro-minimal but sensible regulation. I agree. 
I think prosecuting insider trading and (some) market manipulation tactics will be net beneficial, even if it is a bumpy and blurry road. 
The game just continues to get more interesting as more variables are added, no matter how policy will influence the wind

I think hate on coinbase is overstated. It's pretty convenient, if that's what you want to do. 
GDAX will let you put in buy orders for certain prices if you're trying to catch lower limit buys, but coinbase will always be current market + fee.

Welcome to the world of unregulated markets and arbitrage

A very risk averse option is cashing out for the amount of initial investment - locks in at least some return 
Paying off high interest rate debts would also be a consideration, but at the end of the day I'd still be looking to hold a nice portion

I'd love a power waste statistic on street lights. Let's start comparing, shall we?

Your posts here have aged really well the past 24hrs :) I think you have a lot of good points and genuine concern. That's a good thing. I've been thinking about your responses.

This is one of the only reasonable comments. 
Getting back your initial investment, use some to pay off a mortgage, student loans, etc. all are viable.
