My expectation:
It will drive to final bottom shortly before and with the launch begins a slow but constant rise.
It explodes through the roof immediatly.

You Still Have Much To Learn, My Young Padawan
666 is the sum of the first 36 natural numbers(i.e. 1 + 2 + 3+ ... + 34 + 35 + 36 = 666), and thus it is a triangular number. Notice that36 = 15 + 21; 15 and 21 are also triangular numbers; and 15² + 21² = 225 + 441 = 666.
In base 10, 666 is a repdigit (and therefore apalindromic number) and a Smith number. Aprime reciprocal magic square based on 1/149 in base 10 has a magic total of 666.
The Roman numeral for 666, DCLXVI, has exactly one occurrence of all symbols whose value is less than 1000 in decreasing order (D = 500, C = 100, L = 50, X = 10, V = 5, I = 1).
666 is a member of the indices of primePadovan numbers: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 14, 19, 30, 37, 84, 128, 469, 666, 1262, 1573, 2003, 2210, ... (sequence A112882 in OEIS).

It must be 15² + 21² = 225 + 441 of course
It is now corrected, thanks!
