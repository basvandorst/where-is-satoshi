How is him adding onto the original story, with more story, proof? Still seems like bullshit just from how the principal reacted and the fact s/he conveniently also owned btc.

he could write better reddit insults too

who's the tool downvoting every single comment in the thread?
the downvote button is not the disagree button. if you don't like the discussion, there is a hide button under the title. or if you must, downvote the topic. not answering questions, or contributing to the discussion, but downvoting literally every comment, adds nothing to reddit and just serves making an actual constructive thread more difficult.
kindly knock that shit the fuck off

Then they can't switch the story later and say they didn't accuse him of illegal activity

Get it in writing
@_date: 2014-05-23 07:30:29
is there not some way to contact admins or people above him and have him removed?

it was just the first time it was blatantly obvious to me. there were only a few posts and the majority of them were good questions, and literally everything was downvoted.

they laughed at Louie Armstrong when he said he was going to the moon

how did authy even get effected? I don't even see anywhere to change a password to the app itself. you just download it via google play, which would naturally use your email as the login and it verifies login via phone number. as far as I can tell, you never actually log in with a password, so if you change the passwords from the sites you used authy for, it should be fine.

isn't that kind of discrimination?  I would imagine there would be a shitstorm if any other business tried something similar. Imagine if best buy closed your credit card and wouldnt sell you anything in the store because you were an electrician. 
it just seems bizarre in that analogy, and even more so when you look at the what is actually happening at face value.. an institution that handles money is making a moral judgment against, sex workers? what about all the drug money that gets laundered through them? or anything else? I could be paying tons of hookers out of my account every month, there's no way for them to know.. and if they care so much, why aren't they trying to figure it out and ban me? 
which brings us to the next point, how is it ok for them to look up their occupation/personal info and deny them as a customer based off of it?

how does one make one correctly?
