Wow man bitcoin has taken a massive dive this weekend, really feeling the pain 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:17:06
I’m pissing as hard as I can!
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:33:21
Can you expand on this? Bitcoin is dropping right now
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:34:21
Wow it looks like you actually know nothing.

I use Etoro, it’s nowhere close to 15,000 on my end. Does the price accomodate for Etoro fees?

10th for Cbeo, 18th is CME
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:07:28
Absolutely, thank you for your quick response

Don’t worry about it little buddy, Bitcoin is not for you, go on to live your life without ever having to think or worry about it again (unless of course eventually it’s all around you).

13 hours and counting til futures, I have a small amount invested ($400 USD  I HAVE to close in February (we’re saving to record an album and I put a bit in to see what happens). Sitting happily in green at the moment, I really hope this months futures don’t leave me in the red come close time.

Look again

What is your motivation for almost exclusively protesting against Bitcoins future? Your history makes it look like you’re an unhinged lunatic, not someone who knows what they’re talking about

Ah man I’m still a newcomer, seems Coinbase doesn’t accept New Zealand users 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:26:51
I’ve only got a $200 open trade right now, opened at 9,800 a couple days ago. Sitting on $280. Trying to earn a bit extra for an album we’re recording 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:07:34
Thank you!

Instead of using Coinbase to buy bitcoin, you can just trade on its value in services like Etoro, opening and closing trades instantly 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:59:55
This doesn’t help for the people that bought more recently, obviously.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:29:05
I would much rather buy BTC instead of trade in Etoro, but I’m from New Zealand, Coinbase doesn’t support my country. The vendors that do are closed for trade 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:47:34
Come on man, it hardly bounced
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:08:31
Would love to see hundreds more vote on this

The entire weekend, pick a time, any time

America doesn’t touch the top ten in any metric for the “best place to live”.
@_date: 2019-10-04 01:04:54
What just happened? Coinbase showing a massive drop in the last hour
@_date: 2019-10-04 01:04:21
Coinbase showing a 33% drop on the last hour? From $12k to $8k
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:01:45
This needs to stop.

As someone who isn’t a genetics student, this made me chuckle
