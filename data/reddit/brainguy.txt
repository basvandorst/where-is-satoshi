Haha, I understand how that is a likely feeling from a reddit interaction but I'll let you know from my perspective this utility is not contrived or insignificant at all. As I said I've experienced a bank lock out while traveling internationally and it was a huge pain in the ass. Now I know to call my bank before I do any international travel but I also consider having to call them and give them the locations and dates of my travel plans a pain in the ass. Additionally, as I mentioned above, even once I've called them and let them know my travel plans they still impose 24h maximum withdrawal amounts which is a pain in the ass.

@_date: 2014-03-19 17:51:28
Well it's a 'feature' that has and still does constantly annoy me and many people I travel with. Furthermore doesn't the fact that this type of feature is required to prevent having your bank account from "being drained in some distant country" highlight the superiority of bitcoin as a transactional system as compared to credit cards. This is related to the whole "with a credit card your private key is your public key" issue. 
In fact I could even do things like mimic the the daily withdrawal limit in case I lost or was robbed/hacked of the funds in my hot wallet using bitcoin with best practice security by using time locked transaction from a secure cold storage location to a hotwallet while not being at the security risk of possessing my cold storage private keys while traveling.

You are correct, I interpreted [the Nasdaq official announcement]( to imply use of the Bitcoin blockchain however I could be wrong. The potential value of using blockchain technology with an alternative blockchain then Bitcoin will ultimately depend on the importance of decentralization v. centralization on the value of blockchain technologies [network effects](

The only reason to not trust unconfirmed transactions is if 
1) You believe the individual you are transacting with controls &gt; 50% of the mining pool and thus is capable of a double spend, or
2) If you are not connected to a internet connection you trust, i.e. the potential attacker is faking the display of the transaction on the blockchain

This can happen (and I've heard people talk about making the mistake) if you attempt to remove a portion of coin from a cold storage address and forget that you must specify the rest to be returned as change to yourself. If you leave this field empty in the txn it will interpret any extra coin in the cold storage address as the fee.

I understand what you are saying and I know people often find your opinions controversial, that's what makes them interesting to me (also I'm not the downvote hater). But perhaps attempt to consider it as a signal to noise thing. 
So yes, the transactions are technically useless, however they are constantly providing proof of concept that the network can handle the capacity an attacker is willing to spend (in terms of price, similar to the concept of the *cost* of a 51% attack). All I'm saying is they are contributing to mining reward and clearly not actually damaging the transactional capacity of the network. 
Ideally we would want no spam, I agree. But the world is not ideal, and in this sense it appears the economic cost of attacking the network is to high for anyone that wants to seriously fuck with the network. Considering you are the main proprietor of a pool running (as of this moment) ~5% the hash rate and essentially the only other author of a currently relevant mining software I don't really understand your problem with people spending money to unsuccessfully 'break' Bitcoin.
Edit: when I said "only other author" I was not implying I was the second one, I was referring to [kolivas's cgminer]( as opposed to [Luke's bfgminer](

I don't know much about taxes but I was under the impression these laws only apply if bitcoin is legally classified as an asset, which as far as I know is a topic that has not yet been approached by the united state government. 
Regardless, as I am fine paying whatever taxes I have to when it becomes clear exactly how to do this (a legal definition of bitcoin is made in the united states) my largest question relates to how taxes will work on theoretical 'taxable events' that occurred before this legal definition is reached. Does anyone have any insight or sources that might exhibit a precedent on this type of situation.
