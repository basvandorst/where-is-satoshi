Segwit is opt-in, right? You're gonna be here for a while. Only 10% of transactions are using it and the market clearly doesn't value it.
I'll stick to hodling my BTC and using other coins for daily transactions which is the most sensible option right now.

Nope. There is no war. Bitcoin is not a brand name and has no legal protection. Both BTC and BCH are tokens on blockchains that don't care what you or anyone else thinks. This entire war narrative should be shelved so that we can go on to fight the actually important fight, which is to bank the billions of unbanked people in the world and destroy the corrupt, hopelessly centralized institutions that are hellbent on destroying the world in the name of profit for their shareholders.
I haven't visited Reddit for ages due to this total nonsense, and it truly saddens me that this idiocy is still prevailing.

Maybe the 'attack' you see is a large number of users signalling their dissatisfaction with years of procrastination about scaling leading Bitcoin precisely nowhere. I await with baited breath to see what lightning can bring us, but we seriously need to grow up if we're going to take Bitcoin anywhere, because at the moment there is no point in Bitcoin existing in its current form. Patience is key, I get that, but if you can't get normal people using it as an alternative to traditional banking, then what is the point?

That makes sense, thank you

Really? This is a pretty toxic sub for newcomers at the best of times. I keep seeing people imploring others to put the insults to one side and focus on welcoming the newcomers to Bitcoin, but there's never any change to the ATH posts, memes and insults to "the other side" flying about.

Or until the price of Bitcoin Cash rises to the point that miners stay on that chain, killing the legacy Bitcoin chain. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:59:55
I'm so confused. Aren't the majority of miners running Segwit2X code? Why would they run this software? Seems like Core are looking to further marginalise themselves and their supporters into extinction? Or am I utterly mistaken? 
@_date: 2017-08-27 08:23:01
Miners profit motivation secures the network. If they have no motivation to mine, Bitcoin no longer exists.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:06:46
I lack the foresight or intelligence to make that bet, still hodling both coins in equal measure :)

I thought discussion of altcoins was banned on this sub, yet here is another post discussing Bitcoin Cash. You lads are pretty quick with the old banhammer so I'm assuming that the mods are on holiday or something? What are the rules? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:27:14
It's not an attack though is it. We can only guess at miner's motivations, but the way Bitcoin is designed rewards miners for working on blocks. They may have decided that working on Bitcoin Cash blocks is going to make them more money in the longer term. Maybe they're throwing money at Bitcoin Cash for ideological reason, maybe not. Also mining pools don't have any control over which chain people who buy mining contracts mine, so to put up a post naming a load of mining pools and bunging the word attack in there for no reason and with no actual explanation is little more than FUD in my view

Maybe dig up the evidence first and present it rather than just firing out a conspiracy theory with no evidence at all.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:32:41
It's both, but it defaults to Bitcoin Cash. There's no scam involved, it's just something that's happened that you don't like. There's a difference.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:12:31
How is this a scam? Bitcoin sent to Bitcoin Cash addresses will credited to the Bitcoin address within the wallet.

Is this adding anything useful to the discussion?

Tell that to Matt Corrallo

This sounds rather a lot like religious dogma.
Economic sense sacrificed at the alter of cypherpunkery. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:17:24
When did I mention BU? Or code revisions? 
Thats not what I was talking about.
My point was that multiple implementations of Bitcoin helps widen the attack surface. If the only version of Bitcoin code available is Core's, potentially enforced by law and therefore violence, that to me sounds like an unacceptable level of centralisation. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:27:15
I thought therefore I'd fit in here? Oh well. Bye. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:45:11
The logical extrapolation of this is that multiple implementations of Bitcoin benefit the network.
Blockstream acting as the de facto 'head' of Bitcoin benefits no-one other than those that benefit financially and politically from pricing the vast majority of the world's unbanked out of using it.

Bill has taken some mushrooms his housemate gave him and is no longer sure what reality is. He's sold all of his BTC and bought a load of Doge because the Shibe hanging from his light fitting told him to.
