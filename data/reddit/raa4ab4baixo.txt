Wait, so it's a blockchain.info wallet not Bitcoin-QT? Did you have the option turned on that sends a backup to your email address?

That's really not helpful without knowing how it was created.. I don't think this is a bitcoin private key in any format though. Bitcoin-QT doesn't generate QR codes of them, could you have been using a Blockchain.info wallet instead?
I suspect you have backed up bad data and lost you Bitcoin, though I hope you haven't though.

What generated the QR code, a paper wallet making website, blockchain.info, coin base?

What format are they in now? If they start with a "5" or a "K" then you're already good to go for importing them into a wallet of your choice. Are they made of only numbers and the letters a-f? You'll need to give me some clues about them, preferably where they came from, before I can help you for reals. Certainly don't paste the keys you have here, but general information about their format would go a long way to helping me identify what's going on.
Do they resemble one of the following? These are some standard looking types they might fit, but not a full list.

I don't think this reply was meant for me.

The QR codes displayed by Bitcoin-QT aren't the private keys, but only the public ones. It doesn't make sense that you're getting long strings of 171 characters though. The hex you've posted there doesn't make much sense really, it could be a private key but it's certainly not the QR codes the QT client shows. I'm fairly stumped as to what you've done. 
How did you get this QR code to appear? Is there anything else in the picture that might give you a clue as to how it was generated? 
The more information you give me the more helpful I can be for you.

I think this might be a dead loss for you, I'm sorry there's not much more else I can suggest. I think you being asked for a password was a fluke more than anything else. I don't believe there's a wallet behind the data in your QR code, and I'm not sure where that would have come from either. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 08:05:30
So it's a blockchain.info wallet that you don't have the password for or a Bitcoin-QT one? Those are very easy to crack if they are short and you know the characters. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 07:18:28
Hm, where did they come from to be in that format? That doesn't sound particularly standard. Is it a backup from a wallet like blockchain.info's, Bitcoin-QT or MultiBit?
@_date: 2014-01-19 07:31:12
Hm, I don't remember bitcoin-qt ever making QR codes except for payment addresses (which aren't backups of the private keys). 
Does the key contain any { or } characters? 
Is it all one random looking string or does it have human readable parts?
Can you run me through the method you used to create them?
@_date: 2014-01-19 07:38:51
I'm hoping they exported the private key and made a QR code that includes the rest of the JSON output as well. That's the only explanation, as you're right in that it has never made QR codes of private keys.
