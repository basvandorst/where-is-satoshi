Cycles happen in all aspects of life, and there will always be some synchronicity that allows them to continue. They will always seem like Black Swan Events, and yet they will always happen.
Everything is connected, friend. There are no coincidences. There are intelligent patterns governing the universe that appear to be acausal.

Are you stupid, or just projecting?
Who goes to LocalBitcoins to buy stolen Gift Cards? What is wrong with you?

When I was typing I was caught between just rounding to .1, and gving the actual number (.099......), and ended up typing .01 instead. Typo was my fault. Sorry.

Are you a retarded person? No offense. I'm just asking.

BTC is deflationary, and has more buying power than AGCC. 
Does any of that sink in for you?

Maybe not, if he is buying with a credit card that offers cash back, or frequent fliar miles that he uses. 
There are also limits on how much you can buy (BTC) with a credit card, at places like CoinBase. 
So AGCC could be a way to bypass buying limits.

This was prior to Christmas, and I was trying to go xmas shopping, but only had BTC. . .

I did. Their response was "Amazon Gift Card is High Risk" (Case Closed)
Didn't even ban the user, or anything.

Why would I buy stolen gift cards??
WTF are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:57:45
Go away shill.

And what I was reiterating, man.

There are a million traders on LBTC selling (legitimate) Amazon Gift card Codes. I've bought $10,000 worth or more. Why would anyone assume that any are stolen, if you're buying from traders with tons of positive feedback?
