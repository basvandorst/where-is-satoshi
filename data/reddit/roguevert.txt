It's pretty cool that you can buy anything at all.  I seem to be able to buy much more than before though.

more than the media hyping the "crash" to the influx of FOMO ignorant ass investors scaring them?  
They're not in this as a hedge against fiat. 
 it was the players in this market playing them like a fucking fiddle.  so many seasoned stock speculators are seeing how they easily manipulate the masses. 
may not be BTC, but i'm in this because FUCK the fed

when'd you learn about BTC?
they were giving that shit away for free! that's how i got started, some raffle or giveaway, .0000053btc, cool I guess?
couldn't claim it witout a wallet so had to learn about that.
It was 5$, 1BTC was Five Dollars...
had to research it for a bit, was all about anti-fiat anyway so I said fuckit. i will experiment. 
wasn't until it was 200$ that i had the liquid cash and decided to buy 1.  jumps to 900$, then to 5000$ by the time i look again. wtf!
You don't fucking know, can't fucking know. had a small savings cushion that woulda definitely changed my timeline had i pulled the trigger at 5$

thats the same line they are going to use to push the next cispa/sopa.  stop child pornography act. no politician could publicly go against that.
