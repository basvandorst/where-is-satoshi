Basically I am asking who is behind 80.241.217.46 and what is the benefit of including such a low amount of transactions in the blocks created.

I suspect they are getting an advantage somehow because of this, why else would they do it? I would assume that the advantage would be bigger than including a high number of transactions in order to collect more transaction fees.

I stay in Cambodia and I want to support this. Not sure how yet, but I believe bitcoin can make a big change here. I think the best way would be to use bitcoin and not convert it to riel/dollar, but if you need to convert the bitcoins I suggest using an exchange and a bank account for now. You could also ask the money exhangers here to sell bitcoins. I could buy some bitcoins, but not a lot and not at a good rate.

Its probably the market with the most innovation in fintech and where many consumers are or will be practically bankless.

Maybe the parents or a cooperation of fintech companies will have custody of the keys? Maybe it will be biometric? 
@_date: 2019-02-07 18:52:09
I can't. But other services approved for my region are now relatively fast as long as I don't mind sharing photos of my passport or use a goverment sanctioned eID that requres some work to get initially.
Globally speaking I am very lucky to have easy access like this.

The essence of owning your own uncesorable permossionless money vs not owning censorable permissioned money still stands. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 06:34:02
You have a valid point. Hopefully this will improve.

Mainstream users don't need to know what a private key is. There are many options:
User friendly multisig among friends and family
Distributed custodial services
Files or seed phrases
Edit: Smartphones with integrated wallets as mentioned in a comment here
Who knows what solutions we will see in the future. 
Surely this issue need to be solved before we see mainstream adoption.

Miner fees are optional. At the time there was no problems sending without fees or with low fees. Now we have LN and other coins that are more focused on instant and cheap payments.
@_date: 2019-02-08 06:40:57
Yes, several. Things have improved. Sometimes its still cumbersome depending on the region and the situation you are in. I almost never use cash anymore. 
The point is, do you want to ask permission to store and use money or not?

Yes. Better delete the comments then. I can't find the delete button... who can use the backdoor? 
@_date: 2015-04-22 17:05:29
I don't know... This particular goverment has probably never used violence or threats to intimidate or coerce, especially for political purposes. Or killed any innocent civilians. Its perfectly safe. They are the good guys. Who in their right mind would call them terrorist?? Give them access to everything so we can stay safe.
