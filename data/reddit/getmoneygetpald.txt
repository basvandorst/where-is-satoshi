Oh sure, 20% I totally get. I just mean having 100% of your earnings in bitcoin is just not logical at this point. I put 20% of my check into a trading account, no different.

It depends on what you do with your device. I had the S3 for almost 2 Yeats before I got the Nexus 5 and while I do enjoy my Nexus more it is certainly not a godsend. I would have probably preferred the S4. I actually liked some of the default apps Samsung offered.

No apology necessary man, I should've been clearer. I guess to a lot of people even 1% of their check isn't disposable. I was just meaning I wouldn't want my whole pay check in bitcoin.

Yeah, I don't get why anyone would want a major amount of their check in bitcoin anyways. While I agree it is the future, *it is the future*. Not the present. I don't know of anywhere I can buy groceries, pay my rent, or buy gas with bitcoin. So what, I get paid in bitcoin and then convert 90% of my check back into USD? Sounds like more of a hassle for me.

Did you even read my comment before you replied? Literally the first sentence I said a major portion. 20% is not a major portion. I am replying to the guy talking about getting his salary in Bitcoin.

Battery really sucks. I'm on WiFi 99% of the time I use my phone and my S3 would last almost twice as long as my Nexus battery does. And yeah, for all the circlejerking I see about the camera, this thing sucks dick. Takes great photos if you can ever get it to focus on what you want.

Yeah, or you can buy it in one swipe with your Chase card and get 5% cash back.

Chase Freedom does 2 quarters a year. Bank of America Cash Rewards gives you 3% year round. The Discover It card also gives 5% 2 quarters a year.

Yeah wtf? 30% is pretty huge for something that is actually a detriment to you at the moment.

Most people don't use checks any more and I don't know any businesses besides the grocery store that would even take them.
