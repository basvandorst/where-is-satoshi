Agreed. Though it isn't so farfetched...
@_date: 2013-04-05 21:10:33
Yes, exactly

Outlawing seems like it would be easy. Enforcement would be damn near impossible. It seems that Congress wanted to shut down decentralized virtual currencies, they could (though it seems as though it would require new law as it doesn't seem to be prohibited by any current law). The question is would they and why? FinCEN seems to recognize that centralized virtual currency (Microsoft Points) is similar but they made it a point to make a distinction between them.

Thanks! We hope to see you at one of our locations once we launch.

It seems that regulation could mean two things, either make it so hard to operate a business in Bitcoin that most don't qualify or simply give up or simply provide oversight for consumer protection. The latter seems more likely as Bitcoin doesn't seem like a real threat to USD.

I agree that it is challenging to define Bitcoin but FinCEN seems to be very comfortable defining and regulating decentralized virtual currency, which Bitcoin seems to fall under. When it comes to finance, the government seems to have a knack for defining and legislating in the interest of "consumer protection", "nation security" and whatnot. Complexity never seems to scare them...or their teams of lawyers...

Very fair point...

Great point...my new company Coinflash (shameless plug, I know...) is trying to solve this. We are just getting started but we are planning on offering the purchase and sales of bitcoins from local, trusted retailers. We'd love to hear what you guys think.

At this point, we are signing up agents that already have retail locations, as an add-on to their existing business. The agents will directly represent Coinflash, keeping a portion of the commission. The markup for the buyer is between 4%-8% with the agent keeping between 2% and 6% depending on volume.

They are directly representing Coinflash and keeping a portion of the commission.

Thanks! I'll fix those mistakes right away. We've been so focused on getting feedback so we can give people what they want that we looked over the little things...
@_date: 2013-04-05 21:23:46
Thanks! We are very careful in our agent selection process and have also put a lot of time into ensuring security for both the agent and the customer.

Thanks! Make sure to let us know where you are located.
