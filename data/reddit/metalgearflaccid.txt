Yeah this will end badly.

You can create an entirely offline wallet with a HTML generator and your mouse movements. Print the wallet on paper and who would know who owns it.

Are you my mom? If true now we can get that house. 1NXG4oim1wbaFyn5A1tBHchbQPgpHU7RKb

Is do you even sell that much that quickly?
@_date: 2018-08-13 06:16:32
Cuz I’m a bitcoin billionaire, flash drives in the underwear!
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:36:42
If only there was a version based on cash....
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:18:38
Because it bashes bitcoin cash so it’s greenlit 
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:19:21
What do you think?
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:17:51
Redditor for 4 weeks ^
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:26:23
They are. There’s another post. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 22:24:13
This guy sold at ATH
@_date: 2019-04-26 15:59:18
You provide no factual proof or resources with your claims. You just counter op. So brave.
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:39:27
He was talking about r/bitcoin bannings. 
more info in my ss or you can do your own research on r/btc 
I'll be banned for this prob
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:56:01
So bitcoin will never hit $1mil?
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:06:38
You literally got free money for holding bitcoin in a wallet. Don’t try to make it not what it is. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:35:30
Id have to say your completely opposite on the Bcash situation. If you head over to their subs they are daily getting attacked by thousands of bot accounts and users from here when all they really wanted to do was have a coin go the way of their view of the initial idea of Bitcoin. You aren't helping what the intention of this post with what you say. 
Incoming ban from this sub in 3,2,1 since I posted my opinion finally. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:44:29
The world is not the same as it was before!
NO NO NO!
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:46:25
I think both will succeed 
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:36:04
Bcash was a fork. Everyone who already owned bitcoin got it for free. How does that mean they are scamming people? It was literally free value for all of us. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:10:25
I still can’t understand why the two ideas have to clash with such hatred for eachother. It’s just different ideas on how to obtain the same common goal. We all should be working together to promote all crypto”actual currencies” and not divide ourselves. We need to increase use and popularity for all coins. 
 but as the reddit lore states “ idk tho” 
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:34:29
Just because you’ve told someone they wouldn’t get banned for what they said, you offered to pay them if they do get banned, and you’ve had to then pay them out like you just admitted means I’m right. Think about that my friend.  
I’m no bcash shill but I do think both should strive to work together. Idk tho.
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:06:32
To help users quickly?
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:05:03
1 Doge = 1 Doge don’t forget. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 14:23:00
Read slower I think you’ll get it. I can’t really see where any punctuation could help but my point is that REDACTED implemented this exact situation and everyone hates on it. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 14:25:35
I like how you edit it with my actual comment that I won’t delete because it actually does make grammatical sense. Understanding why I can’t use specific words here I’m sure you can figure out what the word “that” is used in place for. Sheesh. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:20:49
Idk I don’t think they’re trying to trick people into thinking it’s the original. I think they’re trying to prove their vision is more like the original vision but shills brainwash people to think that it’s trying to copy when there just a difference of opinion. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 14:00:45
Ban me but I think it’s funny when you all now are getting excited about block size increases but hate on REDACTED for having done it months ago in the fork. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 14:19:59
Yeah but it’s literally what that did when you all said no and now you’re changing your mind lol
@_date: 2018-07-17 01:01:17
Well there are countless others and you all only focus on one of them so....
@_date: 2018-07-14 14:34:23
I also think it’s quite funny how you defend bitcoin here but post on r/buttcoin that shits on bitcoin. [hmmmmmmm]( 
@_date: 2018-07-17 00:48:02
Funny how you all are so afraid of it that with any post you bring that crypto up 
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:16:55
That website is unbelievably confusing. There isn’t even instructions :(
@_date: 2018-04-17 17:47:57
Should have held it. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:38:18
earn like as by mining?
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:45:58
Thanks. What’s profitable now with a 1070?
@_date: 2018-12-28 18:55:12
This is why adoption is light years away. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 15:07:26
Says Redditor for 1 week. Lol
