I have little sympathy and respect for people working for Gox, especially people working on the notorious support team. Do you want a large, dessert-like coffee with that?

MIDAS is coming soon ish.

I don't think these people are supporters, they realize Karpeles is the only one who has access to their coins. Their life savings are in his hands, compare it to a hijacker who controls an airplane with innocent passengers who want to survive.

Tell him to disappear for a while and sue Newsweek.

Maybe the Satoshi that was unveiled today thought up the bitcoin concept and a group of crypto specialists developed it and did the PR. Just because somebody is clumsy in communication doesn't mean he's unable to be a visionary.

I'm glad Gox is watching their backs and taking security measures. Mark is probbaly the only one who knows the password to access all those bitcoins.

Maybe the "2011 Gox heist" was not a heist.

You can use MtGox as a daytrading simulator, have fun.

Simple, 16.00 dollar is more than 00.00 dollar.

The fear of an exchange falling leads to the conversion of fiat in that exchange in bitcoin. You van transfer bitcoin out in an hour, a fiat withdrawal can take several weeks. Safety first.

Better than throwing money at Newsweek's paywall.

There's one thing you can do with your fiat on BitStamp: buy bitcoins and transfer these coins to an offline wallet.

I don't think the company is 'evil'. MtGox (its founder and the support team) are completely incompetent. 
Handling a lot of money and being incompetent is an 'evil' combination on the other hand.

No verification means I don't have to worry about identity theft. It's worth the risk for me.

Dorian Nakamoto is a model train connaisseur, you can't just give him a lousy train - it would offend him. So instead of a bunch of crappy trains it would be best to give him one epic locomotive (limited edition or a custom made one).
Another thing to think about is the scale, does anyone know what kind of railtracks he uses? It would be a bummer if the bitcoin train couldn't choo choo on his track.

In this case KYC is even helping criminals.

It is uncommon now, it was taught in the typewriting course I did in the late 60s.
