I think that was financial advice...release the hounds

Yes, it's the feeling that you have to get up and clean the apartment when a secretary of the Treasury is talking about money as if it's his first time hearing about how USD is used for nefarious activities....or something similar of course

Anybody in a political/official capacity making the argument that gold is used for money laundering should be stoned by having gold thrown at them.

How is everyone so certain that asteroids are so rich of gold?

This interview was so grotesque. Very hard to watch and a lot of "fremdschämen" (German for feeling ashamed for someone else)

I knew it had something to do with New York

Abstract explanation how our money-based economy works? [
Nobody should be surprised to read this from central banks, many should be scared to read this but 99.99% do not understand the implications of this.

If they state it in their terms and services that they do not want the coins to be used for gambling and they track it and you sign up for it, that's your problem not the platforms. I think that is exactly what crypto stands for: Transparency!

Exactly right, some people will end up holding those bags

He also said "Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.”
People who understand investing are always happy to buy appreciating (!) assets at lower prices.

Under no circumstances use eToro do hold your stuff. Attended a meeting with them the other week in Frankfurt and it's a big sausage shop and they rip you on the spread.
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:45:24
Can you explain this a bit?
@_date: 2019-05-27 11:24:01
You haven't been around for long, have you?

No wonder I live from my hand in my mouth when people like you come in and low-ball my Pizza vending machine business with China-like dumping prices.

It's not arbitraged away by professional market participants. IMO Bitfinex has one of the best looking interfaces for trading and probably a reliably API but if the Jane Streets and Flow Traders of this world  don't touch this free money spread, I'm staying away from it as well.
I wrote in another post that the lending rates on Bitfinex are so attractive right now but this has a reason and the higher return may come at a significantly higher risk. Staying away from that exchange for quite some time!

Speak soon... "I'm not gonna take real money and put it into this thing."

But traders might want to realize some of the gains...totally different approach to the market.

I think both ETFs, the VanEck one as well as the Bitwise one are backed by "physical" BTC and custodied by a Qualified Custodian.
