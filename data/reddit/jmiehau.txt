This is what **Ethereum project** is doing with their transaction fees (GAS PRICE). 
* Each type of param has a fixed [cost of GAS]( 
* Then, with a shelling scheme, the GAS PRICE is regulated by the market.
Users and agents pay the same amount of GAS each time for their contracts executions.

Thanks Jesse for your AMA. Welcome to Reddit.
Are you planning to do regularly audits to proof the reserve of cryptocurrencies? I am aware that your last audit was on 2014..

I am not complaining about Yanis Varoufakis as Keynesian economist. I expect a move of the Greek Government minting a token on top of the blockchain. Like the "future taxes" of his post.
How you could handle to pay your public employees if you don´t have print machines, a public bank and time? Through the Blockchain, using tested software wallets. Like colored coins.
This is my black swan of 2015: The e-drachma.

Giving another address to refund is another way to track you.

Joseph Chow is going to implement Btcrelay on Ethereum before the expected fork for Sidechain on the Bitcoin protocol. :-)

I like this idea to check the address. I suggest you to include shapes like a triangle, circle or square.
In this way you can use 4 colors and 4 shapes. Using just two.
For example: Circle red and Triangle Green.
This is easy to remember than 4 colors in each position. I already forget the position of the image example.
It seems like the Windows logo.

Bitcoin has value as Antifragility at the Financial ecosystem. Nassim Taleb knows already what Bitcoin it is and we will se more comments from him in the future. 
The system is so fragile, Bernanke QE and Manga money are not good for the economy, just methadone to extend and increase the bubble.
