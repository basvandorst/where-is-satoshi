Bank and/or currency conversion fees aren't "stealing".

Simply put:
1. Create an account on one of the beginner-centric platforms like Gemini, etc.
2. Buy Bitcoin, preferably in a dip.
3. Wait until Bitcoin has increased in value.
4. Sell Bitcoin.
Few things to consider:
a) Bitcoin is highly volatile, and can swing hundreds of dollars either way in a very short period. Because of this, never spend more money than you can afford to lose.
b) Unless you are extremely lucky, you won't be successful in short-term trading. Buy a little every month (but again: not more than you can afford to lose!) and just hold on to those Bitcoins as long as you possibly can. In 20 years there is a 50/50 chance you'll be very rich. There is also a 50/50 chance all that money will be lost.
c) There are less volatile investments than Bitcoin.

Problem is if you put in £10 today and tomorrow you have £50...you'll think "but hold on, at this rate I'll have £100 the day after"...and voila, welcome to Bitcoin world.

The most important takeaway should be: never put in more than you can afford. The chance of striking gold is pure luck. If you put in $100 today you *could* have $200 tomorrow...but you could also have $20, that's how volatile the market is.
The "problem" is that once you start buying Bitcoin you'll likely get bitten by the HODL bug, which is basically the fear of selling - because what if you sell today and then tomorrow Bitcoin goes 10x?
To be honest I would strongly advice against trying to make money on Bitcoin. There is too much luck involved. You'd probably do better just going to a casino and putting all your money on the first hand of black jack (very high chance of winning your first hand), then walking away.

Yes, but as far as I know the only way to actually get GBP in your GDAX is to first transfer GBP to Coinbase, then from Coinbase to GDAX.

Yes, but point being that the exchange rates and transaction fees on Coinbase are quite high. More importantly there is no way to directly transfer from GBP-&gt;GBP. You need to first transfer EUR via SEPA, then buy crypto, then sell that crypto into your GBP wallet. *Now* you can easily transfer to GDAX.

"According to" being the key term here.

...they loan out $100 each, not $1,000. Banks can't create money from nothing. They take 90% of your $1,000 and loan it out.

Investing is a good idea, but only if your plan is to hold long-term. And by long-term I mean it should never be cashed out unless it's an emergency. And by emergency I mean either you're in desperate need for cash, or the market is starting to completely collapse.
