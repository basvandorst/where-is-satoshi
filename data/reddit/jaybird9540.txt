Any speculation on how much that would be worth?
I should say, is BTC2x going to start at $0.00 or the current price of $7200(or whatever it is rn)?

I’ve just been playing with it, I’ve never had the money to really invest. Last semester for extra credit we had to buy $5 worth of BTC and I’ve just been watching it.

Oh cool, I knew about the future trading of BTC but didn’t know about BTC2x futures. 
Is that a safe assumption that it would be around $900?

Do you think I should hold both for as long as possible, or sell off the B2x after a month or so?

Well then hopefully you have that response copied into your clipboard. 
Thanks

If they are trying to be each other does that mean one is going to devalue?

Cool, thanks for your responses!

I had a kooky professor for introduction to engineering and technology, it’s been enjoyable to watch it. 
I was just confused and was scheming a little bit about doubling my money. Now I have a better understanding.

So you’re guessing that BTC will drop half it’s value? 
Wouldn’t people be going ape shit rn if it drops back to what it was beginning of summer

Wasn’t the BTC futures why we saw this huge jump to $7000
