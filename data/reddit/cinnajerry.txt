do you really have to be snarky about it?  you're practically pushing him and every other reader to doge.

Joe could change his nickname to Joe 'Bitcoin' Lauzon.

A situation similar to fractional reserve banking could occur at an exchange because once they receive funds into their wallet, they are free to use internal tracking systems to determine what bitcoin belongs to whom.  An exchange would not necessarily want to do this, however, because they are not lending coins to users.  Their income is based on trade fees.
The Bitcoin software itself, however, does not allow for coins to be generated other than from mining.

the problem with localbitcoins, however, is that you could buy counterfeit cash / help launder money.

Buy LTC and deposit it at Cryptsy, Bter, Vircurex, whichever exchange you want.
LTC is going for .0253 Bitcoins.
Take 1 BTC / .0253 and you get: 39.525 LTC.
$5 markup * 39.525 LTC = $197.625 markup
I think the better deal is BTC

It just seems... out of context.  Why not put Jane Goodall on a bill too?  I just think that it would be better to have actual computer scientists on the bills... especially the initial group of people who built Bitcoin.

easiest and cheapest way to buy is through Coinbase or Vault of Satoshi

i got the decline message.  You should look into TIPS, they're currently selling for 46 LITOSHIS  ~ 1.3 satoshis!  You can easily purchase a few million and sit / tip with them.  
If you buy 100,000,000 TIPS, then every Litoshi of movement, you get a full LTC in profit!  When the Cryptsy market  reenables TIPS / BTC then you're looking at 1 BTC worth of profit for every uptick of a satoshi!
It's called a FedoraCoin...  it's been beaten up pretty bad, but fundamentally it is sound, and is undervalued (in comparison to other cryptocurrencies)

The media is now using reddit for it's breaking stories, so I figured I'd ask. lol.
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:33:35
for new users who are late to the mining game, this would be helpful.  How do you know what is a low or a high?

Central banks are endlessly searching to control currencies.  It can't keep increasing forever.  There's going to be a cap.  Banks will figure out how to control it.
Whether it be from banning, seizure (big player's equipment), hacking... the banks will find a way to break / control the currency.
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:05:01
There has to be a cap somewhere.  I don't think Bitcoin will replace fiat money, but it does act as a medium of exchange.  Does anybody have any good theories or models?

Very weird as i have jsut bought / sold on there in the past month.

Is it just me or does this sound eerily similar to the "fire-sales" that occurred at Sheep before the owner stole everybody's money?
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:32:14
Looks like it leveled out before... basically is it even realistic to think $1,000,000?  just having a range of a couple thousand, ten-thousand would be helpful.
@_date: 2013-12-25 00:37:09
it's a stupid typo.  Come back next day and you can buy.
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:43:42
yea, but it's not $1,000,000, or $100,000, or $10,000... that's the point.  There's no moon.  the price naturally stops eventually.
It's the difference between buying in at $1200, $600, or $200... is there room to grow, and what are the chances that it will continue to grow?
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:41:09
ha ha, i'm doing the same thing, but there are people on here that seem more educated on the matter than me, so again, that's why I'm asking.  Plus reddit gets the news faster than the media.  I was on here the last couple days reading up on China way before the headlines hit.  Reddit users seem to be "in the know"... more so at least than the general populace.

So according to this paper... if bitcoin currency can reach a 1% stake as a nominal asset, then a bitcoin would be worth ~ $35,000.  I wonder what it would take for bitcoin to reach that point.  Gold is 8%, silver is 3%.  As far as infrastructure is concerned, couldn't one create a metric comparing bitcoin exchanges (local / online) with the number of gold / silver dealers?

I don't like it... it sounds too much like the scams on Silk, Sheep Marketplace, etc.
1.) There's already issues with withdrawing your money.
2.) They give a deadline / window to get in.  
3.) They lower prices because of the holidays?  Really?  Especially with the influx of new people?
Why wouldn't they setup the withdrawal process first THEN give the discount out... to make sure people will be happy with their service?
Just imagine how much money will accrue after 30 days of parking their money.  I would happily admit I'm wrong, but it just smells fishy to me.
And if it is a scam, just think what it will do to the price.
