Probably not any more than he already gets everyday for whatever he does.  May as well do it.

You can increase your *potential* BTC holdings by buying an alt coin which rises faster than BTC.  I've doubled mine thanks to NEO and IOTA this month.

Even better idea would be to trade your loan on margin.  You can't lose!
On second thought, you might want to go ask silver investors who had the same idea at $30 and see how that worked out for them.

I looked on their website and couldn't find these answers.
