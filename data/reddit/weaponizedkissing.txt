More details can be [&amp;raquo;found here&amp;laquo;]( but the idea is:
1. Create a [Bitstamp]( account.
2. Create a [TransferWise]( account (or log in with OAuth). *Note: that is my affiliate link. You will get 1 free transfer for using that link. Normally TransferWise will charge you a fee.*
3. Initialise a SEPA transfer in Bitstamp [(Deposit &amp;raquo; EU Bank (SEPA)]( This will give you the bank details and reference number to use in TransferWise
4. In TransferWise use the form to input how many GBPs you want to send, or how many EUR you want to end up sending, and click "Get Started Now". That will take you to a form where you need to put in bank details. Use the radio button to switch to IBAN and put in the ones Bitstamp gave you, making sure to enter the Reference number. TransferWise will add your name onto the end, but that is ok. Submit that form. When asked about a refund account, put in **your** UK bank details there. Sometimes a refund will be needed, and you'll get some cash back.
5. TransferWise will then give you a UK sortcode/account number combo to use. Log into your online banking (or however you want to do it) and make the required payment to those TransferWise details.
6. After a few hours TransferWise will confirm receipt of your payment and will then forward it to Bitstamp, and then after 1-2 days later Bitstamp will confirm receipt of that.

Just had this happen to me this morning. [Made a comment here](
1. Yes
2. Yes
3. Windows 7 Pro
4. Yes, but only tv shows from TV Torrents.
5. Chrome for my general browsing, Firefox for web dev.
6. I haven't installed any software on here in quite a while apart from bitcoin-0.8.6rc1-win32-setup.exe from Sourceforge (linked from this subreddit a few days ago). I did visit bitcointalk for the first time yesterday. Browsed a few threads, but nothing else.
7. Nothing that I would expect to be particularly dodgy. beeg.com for some streaming.

Using bitcoin-qt, they do.
I turned my computer on and bitcoin-qt started up (as it should) and I got the nice Windows notifcations that it does of transfers having being completed, from about 4 hours previously (the computer was off). They both show up in the Recent Transactions list.

Wish I'd managed to get the cash in my account the other day when I was thinking about it, I'd have been all over that $80.

I did visit bitcointalk yesterday and browsed a few threads, so that is at least something that might be in common.
But if it's installing viruses they're sneaky ones, as nothing is tell me there's a problem on this machine.

You can transfer a lump sum into your Bitstamp account and hold it there without buying any coins. Once the money is in there in 1-2 (business) days, then you can watch the price of BTC on Bitstamp and do the transaction(s). The purchase of those BTC in Bitstamp is instant, and will just knock down your Bitstamp USD balance while increasing your Bitstamp BTC balance. Or vice versa if you sell some of those BTC.
You can then later opt to withdraw your BTC into a personal wallet, or withdraw your USD into a bank account.

Just bear in mind that the GBP prices (from what I've seen) are massively inflated. If you're doing it for the coins, then more power to you, but £83 (the cheapest non-in-person currently on localbitcoins) vs £41 ($62 on Bitstamp) is a big difference. The face-to-face ones are a bit better, but they still lag behind.

Just commenting to say that the same thing just happened to me. I turned my computer on this morning, Bitcoin-QT synced up and then bam! 2 transactions from 4 hours ago totalling 1.4673 BTC. At least the thief was nice enough to leave me 0.03 BTC...
Here are the details of my 2 transactions:
Here's the thing though, my computer is definitely clean so I am both confused and concerned about how this has happened. The wallet was not encrypted (my mistake, obviously) but apart from that there is nothing obvious that would lead to this on my end.
