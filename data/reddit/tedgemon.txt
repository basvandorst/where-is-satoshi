starting to buy at 9.5k is a lot better than starting to buy at 12k, no?
@_date: 2019-07-07 23:19:24
probably the best -and least stressful- strategy.
@_date: 2019-07-28 17:42:03
this price suppression is something else.
@_date: 2019-07-29 15:17:43
just a passing thought, but what do y'all think about the price being purposefully pushed down until fidelity and bakkt get in so they can get them cheap sats?
@_date: 2019-07-29 16:18:02
100 sats? one cent? i think i'll manage.
@_date: 2019-07-14 23:55:15
those for whom a quick buck is more important.
@_date: 2019-07-29 15:57:01
no need to be rude.
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:49:45
but honestly it's pretty tempting to sell some right now and pick up a few more sats when it drops.
@_date: 2019-07-18 13:39:23
...really? people invest in order to make money, by definition. so if there's a good chance it won't make money, it's not a good investment. which isn't to say i don't think btc is a good LONG TERM investment, it is surely volatile af on the short-term.
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:50:00
if I had to guess, I'd say when it surpasses ATH and stays there for a few weeks.
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:00:12
You know you can check someone's post history and account age right? lmao I've been here longer than you. Regardless, I think this is different because that was the first time, and I think how people are more hesitant. You don't know any more than the rest of us, but you do you, Mr. Cocky.
@_date: 2019-07-15 16:19:27
If I had to guess, I would say that anyone who has been holding bags since 20K will probably not sell at 20K. If your hands are that strong, they're probably strong enough to hold to 50K and beyond. just my 2 cents.
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:42:04
they never gonna keep me down
@_date: 2019-07-29 15:55:08
idk. like i said, just a passing thought.
@_date: 2019-07-24 15:36:15
No, all of us here are completely naïve to the goings-on surrounding btc. We continue to buy and hodl for no particular reason.
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:59:45
twenty bucks a week regardless of price.
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:04:18
throwing my completely unsubstantiated prediction into the ether: I think we will float down to 10k over the next day or two, and then it will shoot up to 11.5k before settling around 11k for a week.
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:58:13
Shit I hope so. For the first time in a long time, I'm hesitant to put in my weekly $20. I'd almost rather wait another week or two and see what happens. Would rather catch an uptrend late then catch a falling knife.
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:04:16
thank goodness
@_date: 2019-07-15 15:40:26
i second this, and i don't see anything above 20k being likely.
@_date: 2019-07-03 16:01:31
if you're adept at all with python, it sounds like something which would be relatively straightforward using some API from CB or any other market website.
@_date: 2019-07-26 19:02:28
I just attempted to send some btc from coinbase pro to my trezor. the transaction said it failed, and that i should "manually" withdraw it. now, that transaction is not in my coinbase pro history, and that btc is not showing on my trezor. wat do, other than email coinbase and wait a month?
@_date: 2019-07-07 23:18:18
I was doing it a little bit last week when it was bouncing up and down a couple hundred bucks predictably, but it's not something i generally do. managed to increase my stack by five percent, so i'll call it a win.
@_date: 2019-07-18 13:39:52
a little below 9K
@_date: 2019-07-26 19:11:54
here's to hoping!
@_date: 2019-07-29 16:18:24
this was the kind of response i was hoping for. thank you for the information.
@_date: 2019-07-05 18:13:22
yeah, this bounce around 11.2 is getting old.
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:39:22

@_date: 2019-07-29 16:09:01
your responses are proof that you're just looking to be a disagreeable jerk.
@_date: 2019-07-10 12:24:48
I think this is a good point
@_date: 2019-07-05 18:15:28
best i can offer is 3 sats
@_date: 2019-07-29 16:02:40
did someone piss in your wheaties, or are you always this way?
you're right. i'm so far deep in my student loans that i started taking money from financial institutions to stay random stuff. but what i said definitely is not rude. it may be ill-informed, but not rude. that's you, bucko. 
you're acting like this is sacred ground for serious conversation. half of the posts in these threads are memes or shitposts or statements about the current price. so stop being an asshole.
@_date: 2019-07-14 23:56:49
i double dog dare ya.
@_date: 2019-03-05 18:05:57
how so? I'm reasonably familiar with btc and how it works, but not nearly as informed as I could/should be, honestly. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 18:01:17
So I use Edge and have a Trezor, and obviously when I transfer btc between the two, they create addresses on the spot. My question is, are those addresses permanent? Could I use one indefinitely say to accept donations for a youtube channel or something?
@_date: 2019-03-05 19:18:12

@_date: 2019-03-05 18:26:59
thank you. so is there an alternative which circumvents that downside?
@_date: 2019-08-05 14:33:03
With great power comes great responsibility. So please sell your stack for the rest of us!
@_date: 2019-08-02 00:20:58
not with coinbase or coinbase pro, no.
@_date: 2019-08-05 14:18:42
except for when the price soars.
@_date: 2019-10-11 00:50:42
participation seems to be positively correlated to price action.
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:10:13
if it did come true, it would be wild af, but now it would have to basically double in a week.
@_date: 2019-08-20 13:22:04
At this point, any amount. I don't know anyone who owns any amount of btc.
@_date: 2019-08-05 14:31:04
I have wondered this as well.
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:27:45
btc up, and a new Tool song today. Could life be any better??
@_date: 2019-06-03 20:43:51
@_date: 2019-10-29 20:09:11
anyone catch that dip to 9100 a minute ago? I was lucky enough to be looking at the chart when it happened.
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:27:51
i didn't catch 7800, but i'm glad to get at little more at 7900 :)
@_date: 2019-06-05 14:47:41
oh, i agree. but i'm usually buying weekly, and i'd like to time that as best as possible.
@_date: 2019-06-07 22:36:47
seems like it's struggling to hold 7.9/8k?
@_date: 2019-10-29 20:42:14

@_date: 2019-10-26 01:59:00
Got my twenty bucks in!
@_date: 2019-06-08 12:29:48
i doubt that, but i do think it'll float around 7.9k for another day or two.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:08:03
how does one get on that mailing list?
@_date: 2019-06-04 01:13:30
here's to hoping!
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:29:50
I always see people say, "I can't wait for lower prices." Well, lower relative to what? Now? That number will always change. If btc goes the way we all want it to, then it won't make a lick of difference whether you buy at 7.5k, 8k, or 12k. If btc goes to 100k, will you really be mad you bought at 9K rather than 8k? Because that percent difference is negligible. If you believe in this thing long-term, then just buy whenever.
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:14:25
Well I think they’ll find a way to make money regardless
@_date: 2019-02-20 14:09:16
@_date: 2019-06-09 16:39:45
we going way down. I bet we'll touch 7.5k before we ease back up. 
edit: y'all downvoting but we touched 7625...
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:10:30
I didn't sell even a little bit. I bought more. YOLO.
@_date: 2019-06-11 01:55:35

@_date: 2019-06-26 12:12:56
well Cashapp finally got shitty. now they are asking me how I make money, who my employer is, how I pay for bitcoin, and now limiting how much you can withdraw, by which I mean not allowing you to withdraw everything.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:09:33
then it sounds like you invested more than you probably should have?
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:40:08

i did.
@_date: 2019-06-29 13:29:20
maybe not, but doesn't this fluctuation around 11-12k feel a little more natural and sustainable than just skyrocketing upwards?
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:30:10
i bought at 10.2 expecting it to dip, buuuuttt...hot damn!

I don't get it.
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:21:42
I bought three quarters of all my btc at 19k. I feel your pain. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:32:40
I'm basically the same way
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:22:25

@_date: 2018-02-01 20:01:50
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:21:32
I think I'll be buying some if it goes under 9k
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:39:12
and every time I sell it goes up. Does this make me a reverse whale? What's the opposite of a whale?
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:13:47
OHHH YEAHHHH
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:25:43
Just threw in ten bucks, therefore it will drop another 500.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:08:47
I bought at 19k..and 17k...and 15k...and 12k...and 10k...am i doing this right?
edit: and now this is my most upvoted comment. thanks for all the discussion it produced:)
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:10:17
sure. HODLing is only a perfect strategy if you know for a fact that eventually btc will rebound, which of course no one knows for sure. And, while I certainly could have been more educated before dumping a couple hundred dollars at what seemed like "good" times, the fact remains that I can technically afford to lose it. N00b status for sure, but I think I was relatively conservative. 
But yeah. HODLing just for the sake of it does not seem like a perfect, all-situations-accounted-for plan.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:58:51
I just bought some, so it's gonna go down drastically in a minute. You can thank me later.

Probably hodl 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:12:23
sure, but couldn't you say that about anyone who's bought since the price started to come down? 
edit:for specificity
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:16:52
for sure
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:30:31
that's the spirit!
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:57:18
Maybe, if you're dealing with a substantial (obviously a relative term, depending on who you're talking to) amount of money that you can't afford to lose. But then one probably shouldn't be in btc, right? But my btc represents a little over one percent of all my investments. I could lose it tomorrow and not lose any sleep. Not that I want to lose it, of course. 
edit: a word
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:52:06
I think mass-adoption will basically require the average joe to outsource his security. It's hard to me to envision a time when even one in ten people is extremely familiar with the intricacies and security requirements of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 12:20:53

of all the wild theories and predictions I hear around here, I think this one is the most likely honestly. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:11:20
I bought a little more around 7k and 8k, and now i'm getting the fomo real bad guys. do i buy more or wait?
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:36:23

@_date: 2018-02-01 21:01:52
fair enough.
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:19:10
3blue1brown’s video does an excellent job of that. I showed it to my wife and it totally changed her perspective. I know that’s a little anecdotal, but it’s a solid video. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:43:20
Hmm? I never said this was all of my investments...I think you may also be assuming I'm talking about large sums of money, which I'm not.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:58:57
very nice!
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:44:43
i laughed. have an upvote.
@_date: 2019-09-17 00:32:37
It would seem that it’s an unfortunate side effect of adopting a radical new system. There will be tons of people who don’t adopt until “everyone else” has. There are still people who refuse to get a cellphone(albeit most of them are older). I couldn’t get my parents into it even if I gave them a few sats and and an aantonop book. But that shouldn’t make it any more difficult to acquire. They’ll just be able to buy less with the same dollar.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:17:06
Haha nice 
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:15:32
lol dude i didn't ask if i should sell. i got the strongest hands in this place! i asked if i should buy more. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:20:49
I would, but I'm reaching the limit of how much i'm willing to lose, which is about tree-fiddy. But I like to think that putting a ten in btc is better than going out to lunch. 
@_date: 2019-09-26 12:10:57
Because people are going to be more willing to invest in something if they won't have to worry about its supply being slowly or suddenly increased, like the quantitative easing of fiat. If adoption continues to rise, supply and demand dictates that the price will increase because there will be fewer and fewer coins mined per block, until there's none left to mine.
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:20:38
Oh yeah it did. but I bought all the way down to 6k. so i'll break even when btc hits 16k. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:54:51
Wont have to because only three people know I have crypto
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:36:17
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:50:23
that's an interesting worldview you have there sir.
@_date: 2019-09-12 14:24:27
¿Porque no los dos?
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:46:56
I'm not sure how else to word my argument. Let's say I have a billion dollars to spare and I invest in beanie babies because I think they're going to make a comeback. You seem to be saying that's a reasonable/logical/acceptable investment purely because it doesn't matter whether I make or lose money on it. And I disagree with that.  
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:59:17
sent a little btc back to gdax to sell, and it promptly tanked. goddamn it.
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:59:01
In that sense I'm using "investment" very broadly, to just mean something you buy, basically. I'm not trying to comment on whether btc should be considered currency or commodity or whatever. I'm the last person to ask about that. And neither I nor anyone else can predict the future, so who knows? All I was and am ultimately trying to say is that the amount of money one has to spend/use/invest on/in something does not solidify the logic behind actually spending it. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:00:27
Google alerts? 
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:18:01
@_date: 2018-04-06 00:17:09
Waking up today and deciding out of the blue that I want to spend a million dollars on beanie babies is not logical just because I am personally convinced they will make me money. It and anything else is illogical if there's no reasonable evidence to support it. And we both know there are degrees of soundness in investing. Buying stock in Ford will always be more sound than buying penny stocks, regardless of how convinced one is about their potential success. But personally I do have high hopes for btc, and I continually buy more. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:43:28
I more or less agree with this, and I never said otherwise. But now we're talking about general btc education, not the reasoning behind people's investment decisions. You can have one of those things without the other. You could know everything about btc and still think it's an unwise investment. You could also know nothing about it and think it's the best thing since nutella. 
edit: words
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:08:00
I wasn't implying I don't want general adoption. I want everyone and their grandmother in btc. It's just a terrible idea to throw a large sum of money at a moment's notice just because the urge struck you. Seems like a reasonable assumption to say people who trade/invest like that don't usually last. Unless they're rich and bored, I guess.
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:39:14
...you just willy-nilly dropped over 6k? Why do I feel like you shouldn't be investing in btc?
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:31:46
I never said that. The amount of money you can afford to lose in an investment or otherwise is completely independent of the reasonableness of the investment. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:32:12
I would agree. I have bought several times over the past week. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:15:19
Straw Man argument. There's a difference between the two and you know it. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:25:04
Are you implying fiat and btc are the same in every respect? Ninety percent of this sub is dedicated to arguing the exact opposite. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:37:46
When I said reasonableness, I meant the logic (or lack thereof) behind the decision.
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:29:42
I'm not worried. Was just making an observation. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 12:40:22
Then I would say you’re looking good so far, especially next to me, cause I first bought at 19k ��
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:20:26
ITT: people getting pissy and defensive because I suggested thoughtful investing. Holy crap. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:30:06
holy shit my dudes
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:47:09
one would certainly hope so. even so, that doesn't make the decision logical.

wow. i bet you're a lot of fun at parties. the numbers aren't "random." the only way you couldn't get the point is if you literally didn't even read the post.  i never claimed to be able to foresee the future, but i did identify objective, statistical trends. you don't have to believe the data translates to a good year for bitcoin. and if you don't believe the stats i come up with, feel free to run the numbers yourself. regardless, chill the fuck out. we're all just a bunch of enthusiasts having a good time.
