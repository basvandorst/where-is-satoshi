That's... not even remotely confusing. I cannot imagine anyone being confused by this.

The bitcoin community is not here to validate you. Smart people--who have grasped the immense potential of bitcoin while most of the world is still sneering at it--don't care about your monkey desire to belong.

If you're going to denominate in BTC, you're not doing the bitcoin community any favors.

Couldn't continue reading after he equated CPU cycles required for mining to CPU cycles required to track transactions.

Lost me at "only has value because people want to use it".
Gold only has value because people want to use it. Water only has value because people want to use it. That's what value is.

The odds of a successful double spend attack are so low the transaction would have to be huge to justify making a customer wait. Making customers wait is a tremendous disincentive to purchase. You might realistically lose 1 of 5 potential sales in a retail store. But even if you only lose 1 out of 1000 purchases, the odds of successfully executing a double spend are far, far worse than 1/1000. You would lose less money by taking the hit on the occasional double spend, if that ever even happens.
And that hit would be nothing compared with the normal cost of credit/check fraud.

"you can never be too safe"
Are you actually Ben Lawsky in a mustache mask?

That makes sense. But maybe you should consider going bigger now. Personally, I think this is the most important bitcoin/decentralization project going on at the moment and I think the most likely to succeed and grow to tremendous proportions. This is so potentially huge that you might be taking a risk by not seeking funding.

It costs far more than 17 cents worth of developer time to collect a tip.

Somebody try putting "Funds for war, spying, secret police, snipers, assassins, wire taps, agent provocateurs, drones, nuclear warheads, rape, ethnic cleansing, genocide, enslavement of humanity. Also bitcoin."
See which one you get in trouble for.

I don't think you understand. We want you to take the coin and make this happen faster.

The layout of the site doesn't even make sense. The bitcoin logo highlights on mouseover but doesn't do anything when you click it. You can't click the first title, but you're supposed to somehow understand that you can click the next one.
"Bitcoin is a new technology which allows for 'Smart Money'. Both a currency and a payment network kind of like the US Dollar + Visa combined."
This is barely even grammatical, let alone clear and accurate. Couldn't make it past this statement.

34, and the idea of reading anything on paper seems positively medieval to me. I use my phone to read books.

"IBM" doesn't exist. It's just a group of people. Now, a completely different group of people from those who collaborated with the National Socialists.
