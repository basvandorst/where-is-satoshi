You pulled the $4 out of your ass, didn't you? Was it difficult to check?

Yeah the graph proves that inflation exists, hooray.


not really
I was only using milk, eggs and gas because they are the same products as they were in the 60's, whereas the rifles he was comparing were probably different models, from different price classes and just in general made 50 years apart ffs. Plus guns may have become relatively more expensive to other products, you'd have to do the research on that. I was even hesitating to use gas because that has risen in price in relation to other common products. 
Basic necessities like dairy products and bread are the best historical purchasing power indicators, but are far from perfect still. University tuition fees in the US have risen astronomically in terms of hours needed to work minimum wage to support yourself, too lazy to find the link for that.
Wikipedia offers [this]( graph for purchasing power, so take that for what it's worth. Decrease from the 60's is there but it's not astronomical.


Yeah, so far. What value does BTC bring to the world if it will never be used as a currency(and it won't)?

This is so misleading it hurts. If this is the kind of reasoning people use to invest in crypto, I'm staying the fuck out.

You don't think that the value(as in current plus potential future usability) of BTC has anything to do with the price of BTC? In that case, what has been driving the price up? IMO it's the promise that in the future Bitcoin will be used as a currency, so you might as well hoard some right now while it's cheap. But I just don't see it happening, too unstable for mainstream use. We might see another bull run from this $13-15K plateau, but I would say that BTC is due for a bear run. Not a steep crash, but a bear run of 6-12 months back to under $8K-ish. 
What is your take, since I'm guessing you're bullish?

Solid argument.

You're delusional if you think you'll ever use it as a mainstream currency.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:33:16
What about the current currency system even needs fixing? The fact that there's 3% inflation a year? I understand that nominal wages aren't moving up as fast as prices and the nominal value of the $, but that is a problem that Bitcoin would solve ONLY in the case that the world COMPLETELY abandoned fiat and made Bitcoin the sole currency on Earth. If you believe that utopian scenario, good for you. Until then, nobody will even consider using a currency that fluctuates this much. It would essentially be Zimbabwe all over again.
It's not faster than a bank transaction, it's barely more secure considering you have to use an exchange that is 10 times less reliable than a bank to use BTC. You'd have to update prices every fucking 5 seconds, so that already rules out grocery stores and pretty much all physical stores. Online purchases off of Amazon and the like are a possibility, but the price of the product would still be displayed in fiat, because the majority of people don't want to pull out a calculator every time they wish to buy something for 0.0058958678 BTC. 
And all of that is AFTER it gets regulated, which it probably won't. You're insane for comparing BTC to the historical innovations you've listed there, absolutely nuts. It's a fucking speculative commodity, not a currency.

Well, ideally we'd make our minds up if it's minimal or low or middle (I suggest we use minimal). Let's take $1.25 in 1965 and $7.25 today(although many states have a higher minimal wage; probably due for an update). 
The rifle example is about as useful as the $4 and $10 numbers, so let's ditch that for [this]( website. Gallon of milk, dozen eggs and a gallon of gas add up to $1.79 or 1.4 hours of minimal wage work in 1965. Today it is roughly [2.96$]( for eggs, roughly [$2.5]( for gas and roughly [$3.29]( for milk, which totals to $8.75 or roughly 1.2 hours of minimum wage work. Some of today's prices are as of 2016 but considering many states pay [above $7.25]( it more or less evens out.

Fully agreed on everything, except a better comparison would be to gold than stocks IMO. Companies actually generate revenue and pay dividends, unlike the other two lol.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:11:23
And what do you call such a thing? A speculative commodity, perhaps?
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:50:55
What are you even trying to say
@_date: 2019-03-19 20:39:05
Would this even belong in the sub without that cringy quote at the end?

Exactly. If it had potential for adoption, it would have been adopted by now.
