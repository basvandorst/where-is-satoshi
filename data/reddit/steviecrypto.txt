That’s awesome! My mom recently used my Coinbase referral code

I was a little let down when the halving didn’t have a majorly positive affect. I have my fingers crossed still. Big fan of Litecoin!

I significantly cut down on my mining due to electricity. I’m hoping I’ll be able to start up again at a profitable hash rate when I get my solar panels installed on the house. The money saved during the winter, using the miners to heat my basement and more, doesn’t balance out the higher hashpower and energy consumption.  Damn I wish I was in college when I started mining. Those kids mining in their free electricity dorms had it made! There seems to issues with people getting caught mining at work to save their own energy bills...I’ve been close! Lol

What about the crypto kept on the exchange owned by people from the US? Can they at least have the option to liquidate or transfer?

My bad. Didn’t realize. I’ll keep it strictly Bitcoin from now on here

Hilarious pic! Much love to the crypto community!

The more exposure for Bitcoin, the better! I’m psyched that more and more people are beginning to open up about it, and eventually adopting it!

I feel that the price often increases as the hash rate does.  I don’t mine to the degree that I used to. The cost versus return hasn’t been the best for the past year.

Nice. I’ve been stacking for a few years, regardless how the market is looking. I did sell some during the big rally a couple months ago to help buy my house! 
I plan on stacking and holding for the long run.

I’m happy either way...as long as 24k comes eventually!
@_date: 2019-09-15 13:44:32
I just continue to stack, hoping that the long term will have me happy. I’m staying as patient as I can!

I think that rate could be typical. I have seen a couple Bitcoin ATMs near me with varying rates. Sometimes depends on the local clientele or the proximity to another Bitcoin ATM. I think they are safe though, and a business. I’ve been thinking about purchasing one to add to the Northeast.

It’s payday and I’m definitely stacking for sats ��

Very good point. I wish that we saw some considerable jumps following the most recent Litecoin halving too!

Whichever he would choose, it’s fantastic publicity for Bitcoin and crypto currencies. There are so many people who are very skeptical about crypto because they know nothing about it. When they see more and more people in the public eye advocating for it, there is bound to be a higher level of adoption.

The pattern may be telling...
@_date: 2019-09-15 00:03:46
Looks like it...perhaps the bullish sentiment will spread!
