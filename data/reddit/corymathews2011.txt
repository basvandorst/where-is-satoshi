It is an Australian exchange, but lists the value of bitcoin in USD

THANK YOU FOR THIS POST! Yes. For being a faithful hodler, I've been on the fringe of unsubscribing to this entire subreddit for exactly this reason.  Thank you for speaking up.

I have BTC in Coinbase and didn't touch it before or after 8/1.  Can I just proceed as normal and sell my BTC when I want as I could before, ignoring the fork? Or will this affect me either way?

I thought we were finally over the "look here's a place that accepts bitcoin" posts but still seems like we aren't.  sigh.  okay, I'll go sit over there :(

Thank you!!!! I subscribe to this community to hear about new bitcoin news, not to see pictures of a random bitcoin ATM in daghastan. It brings down my faith so much every time I see those posts. I always just downvote and ignore the user but they still pop up every day. Really disappointing and makes me want to stop hodling every time I see them.

don't care sorry.

But to post about it every time a new ATM pops up somewhere is to admit how far away it really is... we get that ATMs are popping up, but that isn't big bitcoin news.  A lot of us come here for actual news and insight and the ATM posts have gotten really, really old.  It's to the point I had to finally speak up.  I don't care about getting downvoted anymore, sorry for the negativity!

is this available for iphones on the app store? i cannot find it
@_date: 2017-05-10 03:34:03
Thanks.  Actually couldn't do this as they said I had to be verified actually IN Australia legally.  Maybe I can try another seller, but not sure how trustworthy they all are

I wasn't sure how this works. Isn't this the one where I have to find someone to do the trade? Do you know how easy it is to transfer them back to my Australian bank account when I want to?

Anybody know how an American with funds in an Australian bank account can get that money into a bitcoin wallet? every site I find is requiring me to actually  prove I'm currently in Australia :'(

Anyone know how I can transfer bitcoins from an Australian bank account without having to actually prove that I am in Australia? US resident, used to work in Australia and I've been leaving money there because of the horrible exchange rate.  Was thinking to put it in bitcoin instead, but every site I try is asking me to verify that I'm actually IN Australia which I can't.  Has to be a bank transfer (don't have debit card anymore)

Unfortunately no not anymore to that account.  It would have to be a bank/wire transfer
