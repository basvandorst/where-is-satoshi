So should we believe any charges brought by the government?

You aren't wrong.  I haven't really hid that fact on my other accounts.  I might have made a few remarks on this account too.

Al Capone was put in for tax evasion.  They had no proof of his other crimes.

Don't believe everything anyone tells you.  For all we know Ross Ulbricht never ran Silk Road or was involved in it in anyway.

Do you have proof that it was constructed by FBI agents?

But pre-crime...

What the people from are not getting is that every great person has vices.  MLK is held up as a saint but he cheated on his wife all the time.

The government is made up of a lot of people.  I don't think they always say the same things and sometimes they contradict each other.  I say that if all the government says something its pretty likely that's it true.  Of course we should question everything.  Including people like you or me or even Ross Ulbricht.

And how you should always keep your hits on other people very, very secure.
