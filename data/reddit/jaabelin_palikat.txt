How am I supposed to be working when I can see my networth going up hourly wage every minute?

It's not that we like the high fees, who would? 
The fees will go down once bitcoin is developed to withstand more traffic, through lightning network or other means. 
What people here don't like is the increase in block size to mitigate   traffic due to problems it brings, the increased tx would be welcomed with open arms.

 provides trackers in Stockholm stock market, where you can invest in bitcoin or ethereum with euros or SEKs. They recently gave out forked BCH to investors that held the trackers at split time, altough they were not required to do so. 
The downside is that they curb 2,5% from the investment yearly.

I must admit I was not in cryptocurrency circles 'back in the day'.
That said,  there are two problems I can recall:
1. Increasing block size leads directly to larger blockchains. This pushes regular people away from running their own node, and we would have to trust those that have business incentive to run one, such as miners and exchanges. I think the past few days have shown that miners particularly are in it for business, and in the entire history of the world that leads straight in to questionable actions. 
2. Along with blockchains, the amount of upstream traffic needed to run bigger blocks. One full 8mb block requires 15mbit/s upstream traffic capacity from the miner. That alone would push myself out, since the cost of operating one (basically a business network contract) in my country would push my amateur mining far in to the negative.
