I finally understand why I needed $25k min. to day trade on the stock market ... to limit people like OP from trading and losing all their money. Rules in place for a reason and now I understand.

Coinmarketcap and gdax for example have different 24 hour volume cutoff times so its going to be different. Google is your friend.

Hey Mr Smarty Pants why did BTC just go from $5750 to $6250 in like a matter of minutes?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:36:01
U should sell .. if u are playing with money u cant afford to lose, Bitcoin could drop to $2k levels if this attack continues next week.

Looks like the whales need more time to crash price lower to accumulate

This just proves what I already knew ... the banks and big boys are starting to get threatening by Bitcoin. Good sign as they are scared of losing control and lashing out.
