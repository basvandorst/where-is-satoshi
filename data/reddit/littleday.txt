Your post doesn’t make much sense, you want to send fiat, but she doesn’t want to hold the BTC for long.... so what are you wanting to do? Send her BTC? Or you use a service to convert BTC that would go straight to her bank account so she doesn’t need to see anything to do with BTC? 
If it’s the last one. In Aus we have living room of satoshi. 
But again I’m really not sure what you are asking here...
@_date: 2019-07-11 06:51:53
Ok glad we now understand what you want. �� 
I have no idea if there is something in the UK. Would have to be something I’d assume.

I hate Coinbase for their ethics as a company... but both times I’ve had to contact support i was contacted within 5 days and problems resolved. Maybe I got lucky tho... 
but try to avoid Coinbase regardless. There are other options.

Just put in a support ticket. Had same issue. They fixed it in 5 days.

It’s fast, has Segwit, LN and is long term tested over attacks and has the ability to implement BTC tech. 
So all the benefits of BTC with the the speed of BCH... 
I hold all three, so I don’t pick one over the other. I’m letting the market decide. But you can’t openly rag on LTC as it is a pretty awesome coin that sits perfectly in the middle.

If I have one BTC and they ban BTC I’m still storing 1 BTC worth of value.

Dude no need for hostilities, BTC isn’t like any investment you’ve ever used before. You are 100% responsible for yourself. So if you fuck shit up, that’s your money gone. No one to get it back for you. 
And if you can’t follow the simple basic steps on the CoinJar  app that spell it out to you how to do it. Then yeh probably take yourself down a few pegs and actually learn what you are investing in. 
We are not even into the topic of trading. Just simply buying. CoinJar with Bpay or bank transfer from Australia with CoinJar could not get any easier. 
But hey yeh just have a go at me and throw your 5k into something you Cleary have done no research on. I don’t give a shit. Was just trying to offer you some advice...
@_date: 2019-11-15 13:34:33
CoinJar is incredibly easy... if you can’t work it out I’d suggest you do more reading about what bitcoin is and what you are actually trying to do.

I used to date a real fucked up person. She wasn’t fucked up when we first met. But she got hooked on drugs and shit. Big down spiral. I thought I could help her but I couldn’t. Any, while we were still together... I heard of bitcoin and loved the idea she couldn’t touch it or steal it or spend it. But we had no spare money because of her. So when I got spare money, I would hide it in BTC and didn’t tell her. So she couldn’t see the money, touch it or steal it. As far as she knew, we just ran out of money towards the end of the month earlier. 
Turns out it was a blessing. 
This was pre 2017 bull run. By the time I was able to break from her, I had a decent amount. I finally got strong enough to realise there was nothing I could do and I finally got rid of her. 
Then the 2017 bull run happened. 
Life went from fucked up to pretty good very quickly. I thank bitcoin every day, because bitcoin helped get me back on my feet for a few years. 
I totally get how people don’t buy any tho when you live pay check to pay check. It’s hard. But buying BTC was best decision of my life.

They will do what all ewallets do in Asia. Offer massive discounts if you use their coin. Same like DANA, OVO, LinkAja Go-Pay in Indo. Indo is already a heavily cashless environment now. I almost never use cash. Because it’s sooooo much cheaper to use your ewallet to pay for anything. 
For example, if I pay cash to get a taxi to work it’s around $5, if I use their ewallet I get to work for about $1.  Apply that to every resto, shop, service in Indo, it’s cheaper.
So yeh they might have BTC, LTC, fiat etc. but when you see it’s cheaper to use libra, the average user will just top up their libra account and spend Libra coin.
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:17:03
Exactly, so I buy a $10 burger meal, I’m not getting 50% cash back. I’m getting 25% cashback. 
They hide the fine print of the maximum $2.5 so Small and the 50% cashback in large fonts you could see them from across the room.
@_date: 2019-06-05 14:18:14
Yeh I agree. And also probably hard for merchants to use crypto in China and Indo seeing its not so accepted here. I just love using the ewallets here, Dana,Ovo, Go-Pay, all interconnected with other services. It’s like a beautiful glimpse into what could be the future of bitcoin. The nice other thing is, apart from the custody and education around your keys etc. These big tech companies are basically teaching people how to use crypto wallets. So once crypto wallets can catch up to the design and functionality these wallets offer, it will be a beautiful day...

Question... say your bank goes under and you have debt... does that mean your debt is wiped? Or like how’s that work?
@_date: 2019-06-05 14:57:19
Yeh, from my point of view, from living in a western country to eastern the last 5 years. Western counties are just not seeing the same innovation that eastern ones are in fintech. 
I already live a cashless life in Indo. It’s cheaper to do so... I just wish there was a way to choose crypto as an option on these ewallets. 
Hell even DANA lets you connect your credit card up to your ewallet so you never need to top up again. This is the most annoying part for me with ewallets. Topping up. 
If I could choose to link my crypto wallet to the ewallet it would be so awesome. I wouldn’t mind it DANA took a small fee to do so.(yes I know that defies the point of crypto) but let’s be real, mass adoption is having services like GOJEK and grab having crypto as a payment method.

Who knows what’s really gonna happen and be allowed...
@_date: 2019-06-19 05:12:29
If libra allow BTC to Libra options sure.
@_date: 2019-06-05 20:19:25
None of the major ewwallets accepts crypto. And if you don’t live here you don’t understand how much of a major part of everyone’s lives they control.
@_date: 2019-06-06 03:26:51
I don’t see these as e-wallets. Just cashless systems. Download GOJEK, Ovo or DANA/alipay to see what a proper ewallet looks like

THIS .... Fucking this exactly me last night.
Needed to buy plane tickets last minute for my girlfriend. Wouldn’t accept my credit cards or any other bank cards for security reasons. Even called my bank 3 times to fix this, eventually their response “yeh there is nothing we can do” I thought fuck... I can’t spend my money, it’s my fucking money...
Googled for website to book plane tickets with BTC, plane ticket booked. 
Seriously... BTC is the only way to be in control of your money. Fuck the banks.

I got in at 1.6k. When I notice it starting to drop, thankfully my car died, I sold a chunk to buy a new car. Felt horrible that I had to, but gotta do what you gotta do. 
Then the price crashed even more... and I bought all my investment back in start of the year and here we are back up again. 
But because I sold a lot when it was high I didn’t feel to bad about the price dropping.
Soooo yeh I got lucky....
@_date: 2019-06-05 20:22:24
Yes western counties like Australia, when I go home I also never touch cash. But it’s different. There is cashless, and there is smart money cashless. It’s very different. E-Wallets provide a different experience to credit card cashless that we don’t get in western countries.
@_date: 2019-06-25 08:04:58
Lol it’s a trick tho... it’s 50% cash back maximum cash back tho is $2.5.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:10:31
Why are your prices in Fiat? 
@_date: 2018-03-25 04:23:13
I haven’t carried cash on me for nearly 3 weeks now. Nobody uses cash in Aus anymore. Everything is paypass/visa paywave. Much quicker and easier than handing cash over then waiting for change etc.

I've been doing payments up to 150 a week on coinbase for a while. Just since things seem overloaded the last week or so that method no longer works.

I was just in Irkutsk in russia. One of the biggest hub’s of bitcoin mining as it’s the cheapest electricity in the world completely powered by hydro power... it’s incredible... 
They have factories setup there just for bitcoin. 
Once the world is more green this shouldn’t be an issue. But yes until then... bitcoin is not very friendly to the environment.
