Exactly - I also have a online store and I have to wait at least a month before I receive the money in my account at a 2,5% fee. And damn, I fell that I'm the credit card myself when I use bitcoin.

My bank charges for transfers.

Hurt the eyes..
-Dont use gradient behind text, nor textures.
-Change upper line to a green uptrend instead of a falling price graphic line - and its red!!
-Work on the bitcoin logo. Its not rotated as the original, use a circular shape. Remove that red line that circles the shape
-Remove this ugly ass blonde :D - BTC is not a physical gold coin. Its a digital asset. Use a global map with lines connecting several points, like the image here on reddit
Just my coin to you ;)

Feeling the same way man... Calm down, dont suffer. I sold at 12.600 and gave up regreting with "what ifs"
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:20:09
Just sell, and stop suffering. Or sell, and start suffering like me after 12.600

I understand it, since I dont agree with it.
Nobody knows anything of the future, specially bitcoin prices or adoption.

Well, this pretty much looks like the real btc graphic: 
If it wasn't for this month price grow, they are almost the same.

Localbitcoins used to be fine to use but nowadays the amount of requirements and verifications to comply with money launder laws made the experience pretty trashy.
I was banned two times before I completely stopped using their services.
Besides, the Privacy and TOS change every month

Past performance does not predict the Future..

You can buy and sell btc without moving them. On the exchange of course. So I think you are correct
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:09:00
And you buy all government lies
