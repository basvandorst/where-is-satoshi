This statement treats the spending of a quantity of money as if it only affects the economy once.  That money is injected, and help fuel economic growth over time.  When you save $100 for two years, that $100 is taken out of the economy.  In those two years it's spent, disseminated, spent again, saved for a bit, spent again and fuels a lot more than just a single $100 purchase.
Furthermore, *of course* savings can be a good thing.  For the individual, savings means stability.  But too much savings can mean that you aren't enjoying your life, you aren't investing for the future, you aren't eating.  So there are reasonable levels of savings.  In much the same way, there is a reasonable savings rate for the economy as a whole, which allows for long-term stability but does not stifle economic output.

Says the "self-taught" guy arguing with a dozen people educated by a system of hundreds of years of economic study.  I guess you are right.

You are completely unbelievable. You think that maybe, since the invention of currency, that we've seen a net positive or negative?
Fuck it. You're right. I could spend my $100 to pay someone to bulldoze a bunch of factories for a net economic loss of $10M. Clearly over time that's what most people have done. You're right. Good day.

Why would he have a job if he has all the money in his wallet suddenly increase in value 1000%?
Why would anyone?
