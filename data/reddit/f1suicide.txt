The fact that we recovered from this dip so rapidly is an interesting sign, however I believe it was nothing more than the usual weekend bot activity. Weekly candle stick is also closing in a few!
@_date: 2019-07-29 00:08:07
I have my chart set like this as well, I like the marks you drew too. The weekly candle stick is closing in a few, this might get interesting...
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:33:42
Maybe even $11k or $12k
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:42:59
Yeah agreed, a double top as an ATH would be strange.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:26:20
NiceHash, one the of the simplest ways to get started with mining.

Just because something is true doesn't make it edgy... Sure asking questions can be informational, but if it is something so simple, it just shows how little effort you've put into understanding what you're risking your money on.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:07:59
There will most likely be a correction within the next week so just hold on for now
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:19:13
Have you seen the prices mate?
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:39:48
Yeah people got real angry for no real reason, was just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:25:20
Look at the sell wall, currently at around 200 Bitcoin. However just a couple of hours ago it was 450-ish.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:11:39
A while ago there were rumors that Amazon will accept BTC, the price jumped +$2000, maybe not directly because of it but probably helped out!
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:49:22
Do your research, why would you invest in something you don't understand.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:18:51
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:05:22
Yeah no I get that, I don't understand either, people just start selling without evening figuring out exactly what happened.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:46:15
Not many exchanges have surpassed 10k yet, huge sell walls.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:57:56
A general rule I use is to never do it all at once, take your time, spill up the funds a little.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:19:18
When the market rises to the point where it is no longer sustainable at that price point a correction happens. The price drops.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:02:24
That was short lived, price is at 8k again...
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:53:59
I think they are experiencing too much activity, too many new users and not enough infrastructure.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:07:50
The difference between a troll and a comedian on this site is user credentials, you my friend are a comedian.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:24:09
Woah really?
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:13:23
Sounds good :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:36:18
I mean you're not wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:35:46
I use Exodus even though it seems to be unpopular
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:14:29
It still amazes me that people think BCH is legit
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:48:30
This is... I don't even know what to say.
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:10:17
This makes me have that one emotion that causes things to break :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:27:16
This one is called NiceHash, it is one of the best for people who just have gaming rigs and subpar computers. I think it's quiet good.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:49:40
Same, have exchanged some BTC for BCH for this, hoping it reaches the same level it did last week, or even higher if we're lucky!
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:51:44
I believe in Block chain tech and cryptocurrency but I really don't think BTC will ever hit 100k.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:11:00
Well I'm no expert, like I said it's just my opinion. Firstly Bitcoin is kinda outdated; high fees, slow transactions and slow block times. I think that a lot of price shifts we see nowadays is because of hype and get-rich-quick mentality from Mom and Pop investors. And secondly I think poeple will shy away from continuing to buy BTC, when you see that 100k price tag it's very daunting. Owning a small fraction doesn't feel the same as owning a whole coin or token. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:58:41
HAHAHA, literally I could have made that website in an hour! It's fake pal.
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:56:54
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:32:23
Who would have thought :)
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:17:06
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:27:59
I mean that would be a pretty sick way of losing graduation right?
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:45:42
Find a Bitcoin ATM, they don't require anything but your money and your BTC wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:25:39
Your GTX 980 isn't going to be making you a fortune but probably around $2/day with NiceHash Miner, I would recommend.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:46:56
Yeah I realize that, but I think it is very misleading, as you can see it's causing newbies to think there's a discount on Bitcoin itself...
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:22:05
Lambo airdropping into your yard mate!
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:19:55
Definitely more than that, also depending on how fast we get there.
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:51:38
Does any other currency cost less on Black Friday?
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:25:14
I came across this as well, after realizing it was 18+, I used my parents identification (with consent of course) to set up another account. And still the account was restricted, I deleted all cookies from coinbase as well so I am really interested how they knew it was still me :/
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:09:26
This really playing with my emotions right now, I do not like this game anymore :(
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:31:21
Ah well
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:26:54
There will definitely be a lot of excitement after it hits $10k so I wouldn't be surprised if it goes to something like $10.5k but there will be a correction. It's simply unheard of for a shift like this to be sustainable. 
@_date: 2019-04-30 20:02:24
Yeah sorry but no one with a brain agrees.
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:29:33
I can't wait for the denial stage of this subreddit to pass and we can all finally have grown up discussions!
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:33:56
I'd agree since every trader knows that the asset can go down only 100% and at the end of the day its just another nice opportunity to add to your position, while in an uptrend we can go up an unknown amount and theres a level of anxiety that comes with not knowing where the top is and when it would be good to start pulling out money.
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:47:26
Buying in as we're faced up against the strongest resistance of the entire market, genius ��
