Take a deep breath...
Yes, every trade is “taxed”.  But only for the amount you actually gained on the trade.  And if you lose money on a trade, you get to reduce your taxes.  It’s not that complicated.
1. Buy 1 BTC for $1000.
No gain/loss
2. Trade 1 BTC for 30 ETH (BTC worth $3000, ETH worth $100 at the time).
Gain of $2000 from realized BTC sale
3. Trade 10 ETH for 100 LTC (ETH worth $50, LTC worth $5 at the time).
Loss of $500 from realized ETH sale.
4. Trade 100 LTC for 2 BTC (BTC worth $2000, LTC worth $40 at the time).
Gain of $3500 from realized LTC sale
5. Trade 10 ETH for 0.3 BTC (BTC worth $10,000, ETH worth $300 at the time).
Gain of $2000 for realized ETH sale
6. Sell 0.3 BTC for $3050 shortly after the previous sale, BTC increasing very slightly in price
Gain of $50 from realized BTC sale.
7. Sell 10 ETH for $6000 ($600 per ETH)
These are the remaining 10 ETH from your original 30 at $100.
Gain of $5000 from realized ETH sale.
8. You hold remaining 2 BTC and it crashes to $10, at which point you sell for $20.
Loss of $3980 for realized BTC sale
Now let’s take stock. You have no crypto left, which you can see if you follow all the trades.
You sold for USD three times, $3050, $6000, and $20.  You bought with USD once for -$1000.  So your net is +$8070 USD
But we don’t pay taxes based on “net” but rather we must report individual trades.  So surely we are going to get screwed by paying taxes multiple times on the same money!  Let’s add up all the realized gains and losses:
2000, -500, 3500, 2000, 50, 5000, -3980
And it sums to... +$8070
So no you are not paying taxes on the same money over multiple times. When you gain you increase your taxes, when you lose you reduce them.

Thanks. I’m going to give it a few weeks and will enjoy the climb up. Thanks again. Thanks

Nice. I’m thinking these people should bring us to maybe 100k. By then there will be new people who want BTC. Those new people should
Get us to around 1m. Then new people will want BTC, the total number will be even bigger. They should help bring us to around 5m. That will bring new people wanting BTC and the larger number should take is to 20m. By then the number of people wanting BTC will be bigger than ever and the price should go to about $100,000,000 a coin. I’m thinking this will take about 1-2 years but worst case maybe 3 years from now.

Look.  If you enter crypto in Jan this year, do a billion trades over the year, and then sell everything for USD in Dec, you will end up simply paying normal income tax on the amount you gained.  You won’t get the lower long-term tax rate, but you won’t get taxed multiple times.  It only gets messy as you start to span over multiple years if you aren’t careful.

To be clear, the consensus is that crypto-crypto trades are taxable events.
There are two main reasons for the “fuss”.  
One, if someone buys 10 BTC for $10,000 in Jan 2017 and makes a bunch of great crypto-crypto trades all year, they might currently have 100 BTC.  If they decide to sell in Feb 2018 that would be over 365 days of “holding” BTC since they bought over a year ago.  This would allow them to pay long-term capital gains tax which are much lower than normal income tax.  However, they can’t do this if crypto-crypto trades are tax events. Because they were trading so often between BTC, ETH, LTC and so on, they didn’t actually hold anything for nearly 365 days. Every trade was short term. So they must pay more taxes.
Secondly, imagine this person simply held their 10 BTC until Nov 2017, at which point they traded them for 400 ETH.  Say prices were $16,000 per BTC and $400 per ETH.  This trade is a tax event.  Basically they sold their BTC for $160,000 and used the money to buy 400 ETH.  Since they paid $10,000 for that BTC, they now have a gain of $150,000 from that trade.
March 15th 2018 rolls around, and still they are holding the 400 ETH. They have no actual USD currently. Yet they owe taxes on $150,000 gains from 2017.  This means they owe $40k to $50k on taxes.  This is a bit of a problem.  They owe taxes on money they don’t actually have, as their investment is still tied up in crypto (ETH).  If crypto prices are still high, they can sell off some of their ETH to get USD to pay the taxes.  But if ETH collapsed in price by then to say $50, then their holdings are only worth $20k.  They can’t even pay their taxes.  That sale would trigger a -$140k realized loss, but it’s a new tax year.  Had they sold for that loss in the same tax year, they would reduce their tax liability from $150k to $10k, and the tax problem would be solved.  But they can’t.  They owe huge taxes for their 2017 “gains”, and simply get to report losses in 2018 (the losses can be used to reduce taxes in future years slightly, but can’t reduce previous years).
So being taxed on crypto-crypto trades can push your trades from long-term gains to short terms gains.  It can also spread your gains/losses over multiple tax years, causing extremely negative results for you if you aren’t careful.  So hence, the fuss.

I don’t think I’ll ever die because that requires something like getting cancer and currently I don’t have any problems like that.

Obviously not.  Nobody expects a hype train to turn south.  Why would things go bad right as interest is peaking? Yet it always does.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:36:02
Yeah I'm aware, this one is nowhere close to done though.  And it sure isn't going to recover in a few weeks like the prior.
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:29:32
That's relieving.  Glad I can still sell for $4900
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:20:58
Nobody is going to walk away, most people will keep following and scratching their heads speculating as to why the price keeps dropping while continuously anticipating a reversal back up.
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:21:29
Feel fucking awful.  Like a knot in my chest honestly, which will go away but is embarrassing to admit. Hating that I didn't go with my gut and unload above 4k and especially 4.5k

I think almost all China rumors (not sure why everyone keeps using term FUD).  But bad news like this comes out all the time during bull rallies and the price doesn't flinch. So the string downward reaction can be mostly attributed to typical market swings, where it's just selling down as speculation decreases.  Maybe it's just another pullback before higher levels, but could also be the start of a long consolidation period as speculation decreases for months/years
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:56:17
Yeah that could be normal but you never know when a historical trend will break forever.  It's not as simple as just happily holding to 1200 and patiently awaiting for 20k after that.  It might not come, even if it does you don't know so at the time, and even then you have to wait several years to realize the gains and purchasing power.
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:29:12
That's exactly what I am already dreading.
@_date: 2017-09-14 00:00:18
That's why I'm feeling wrecked.  I don't trust myself to trade, selling after a big crash is asking for trouble.  But I don't like the direction things are going either.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:01:20
Yeah you will probably dig this post up in 4 years when/if it gets there but that doesn't help anyone, including yourself, right now.
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:43:41
Yeah fking right. It's so gassed this is sad. I don't think it will finish 2017 above 3k, let alone current 3.8, let alone ATH 5k.  Things are wrecked for a while sadly 
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:38:08
China panic will blow over, and then some other bad news will come out. It always does.  Not because the news is overall bad, but when price is dropping nobody looks for good news to explain it.  So it drops more, more bad news.  Then it drops for no apparent reason and people get sick of it and things go very bear. The fact people are expecting a recovery is furthering my concerns

Yes and BTC was hitting mass adoption and FINALLY getting merchants like Microsoft on board in nov'13.  It was only starting.  There was nowhere to go but up at that point, and fast.  No time for down.
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:05:33
I did go long over time during the sub 500 stretch.  Back then I felt good about the risk/reward.  Right now I don't feel as good.  Even though I am in the green now, it really doesn't make it any easier to experience big drops.
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:15:18
Okay, well at one point they sold for $1.  So if it drops to $10 should I chill out? I mean 1000% is quite good for 7 year return.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:57:21
It's not that difficult. Give encrypted private keys to your beneficiaries as per your distribution wishes.  Create several dead-man switches (with multiple services for redundancy) with the decryption password, ordered to send to a few anonymous email addresses. Give the email logs in to your beneficiaries.  Have a few tester deadman switches expire every so often. Log in to the emails periodically to ensure they are still open, and that the deadman switches are operating correctly.
This way the deadman switch services don't have your keys, and don't even recognize anything valuable.  They wouldn't know who to contact anyways as the email is anonymous.  And you don't have to trust your beneficiaries since they won't have access until your deadman switch expires.

Yes completely correct.  Moreso today. Fuck...
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:50:23
Yeah cool that gives me a lot of confidence because they have no incentive to convince customers they will remain open as long as possible and clearly this is all rumors and fakenews /s
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:28:36
I invested an aggressive amount but think I have cashed out more than I put in.  I'm not leveraged, most is just in personal wallets.
I'm very confident in my knowledge, or else I'd certainly not be holding at these prices.  I am still primarily aiming to make money.  Regardless of if it goes to $100 or $10,000 from there, I will be unhappy riding it down to $2000 or lower.
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:16:31
No interest in a wager as the semantics and counterparty risk make it cumbersome, besides the fact I am already essentially wagering in the market.
There is always a lot of awareness and adoption as hype and price builds for everything.  They were just building and hitting the "tipping point" back in 2013 right before the price collapsed.

I'm not FUD trolling I am legitimately FUDing.  I've been around it for a few years.  Losing money isn't fun even if it is paper gains.
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:28:25
I wouldn't reinvest if I rode down with these holdings. That's another reason I'm wishing I sold more already, to be comfortable rebuying in some months if it falls hard
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:10:16
I'm feeling super wrecked. I am a successful holder and poor trader. I have been anxious and stressed ever since the first $100 drop from 4950.  I've felt kinda sick all week anticipating a really big correction that doesn't recover well.  It sucked but I could tolerate the drop to the low-mid 4000s.  But even at that time, I already felt the further and more painful drop coming.  Now we're back under 4k and falling. It's going to be super disappointing to end up selling at something like 2.5k instead of 4.5k+
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:29:16
Well usually the level of dread turns to despair before things turn around.  By then it will probably be so painful I'll just want to sell for whatever and not even care.

The whole concept of a currency needing inflation to function is unrelated to what bitcoin is.  A governments economy and their fiat cash supply is very different,
The entire logic is circular reasoning.  It's like saying a restaurant will go out of business because they are so crowded with customers, the wait is too long.  Makes sense right? Nobody wants to wait an hour, so people will stop going.  Clearly the answer is that an "equilibrium" is reached.  The same happens with bitcoin.  You are literally talking about the supply and demand, which ultimately sets the price.
The value of this asset (bitcoin) is not super complicated.  You are convoluting it.  It's a store of value, period.  But it has a ton of benefits versus other value stores when held in a wallet:
-Unaffiliated with any government
-No 3rd party required to access
-Total portability to anywhere in the world with internet access
-Predictable total supply (scarcity)
-No risk of counterfeit / fake units
-Fast, cheap transactions (compared to other assets).  Even today with limited adoption BTC is quite liquid.
It gets referred to as digital-gold a lot, and I've always felt that is the best description.  Gold is really no more aesthetic than, say, aluminum.  Such metals were even revered as highly in the past when they were rare due to lack of extraction technology.  
Gold is scarce and usable/durable in accessories -&gt; people want it -&gt; price is high -&gt; people are impressed by it
It's not that gold is just inherently incredible.  It just ticks the boxes for a good asset, which makes it hold value.  Which in turn adds use to the asset as a store of value.  The same happens with bitcoin which is why it is finding levels of adoption.

I think I've cashed out more than I've invested at this point.  But I still have a lot of equity and having paper gains erode so quickly is very stressful, especially when you sense it is coming.  I considered selling several times above 4.5k so it feels like I've lost $800+ per BTC right now, which doesn't make for a fun couple weeks.  And that's just so far. I'm not looking forward to the rest of the month.
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:00:20
I bought it as a long term investment over a year ago.  I did turn the screens off for a long time.  Long is a relative word and maybe that has arrived.  I don't know.  I'm not really trying to trade, but when the price elevates heavily and I'm heavy in cryptos, it makes sense to sell some.
I guess I have a foot in both camps but am not committing either way.
