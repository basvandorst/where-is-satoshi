That's true, but it's also not what bitcoin is about.  Anonymity would be a benefit, but the protocol specification pretty much made out the opposite.  Since every transaction is there on the public ledger, you do have to try to be anonymous.  I don't think most people would care that much one way or the other, IMHO.

Coinbase much?  It's really not that hard to convert USD to BTC.  It used to be, because you had to jump through a thousand different hoops and hope that you weren't overpaying by a 50% margin, but now you just go to Coinbase, sign up, and buy some.

has the counter to your argument. Yes, the block chain is great, but it isn't anything useful without the currency, which provides the incentive to mine blocks as well as being the ledger for all transfers.
A central authority could create a "digidollar" currency that does the same thing and has no cap to the amount that can be created, and that rewards you with "digidollars" when you mine a block, but if you use that, you really haven't made any improvements over your current fiat currency, have you?

The idea isn't so much the _Wall Street_ impression of greed as it is the desire to profit from making innovations.  Ideas have a chance to incubate and thrive in a society with less regulation since the "cover charge", as it were, has been lowered to nearly zero.  No need for lawyers to make sure you're following every single regulation the government can throw at you.  Ever tried to start a bank?  Certainly not a good example of innovation, but at the same time, nearly impossible since it requires so much capital just to make sure you're in compliance.  This is why the "haves" become so far disconnected from the "have nots" that they can get away with shenanigans no one should be able to get away with.
Let's drop it down a level.  Starting any business these days requires so much compliance that fear is what stops most people from filling a need.  Capitalism is a system that is supposed to give an average person the ability to create services that fill those needs, and competition is what is supposed to bring prices to an affordable level for the masses who have those needs, otherwise known as "The Market", unregulated.

How about a full investigation to find precisely the people ultimately responsible for the crimes, arrest them, and promote the highest executive who was in the dark (assuming there was one) to CEO position? No bank closure that way. Even if there was a bank closure, I don't think the effect would be as widespread or long-lasting as you make out. I think businesses, no matter how large, should be allowed to fail. While HSBC is huge, I doubt the acquisition of it from another bank was larger than BoA acquiring Countrywide. And the recession back then was from the unwinding of debt collateralization.

This right here should explain why Bitcoin will succeed. We all know how his Internet prediction turned out...how about 640KB? Is that enough for you? With Bill, past history DOES seem to indicate his future performance.

Uh, that would be the bid price. Selling at market, as I'm sure bit pay does, would sell at the bid price, and as you correctly pointed out, that causes the price to fall. Simple solution--buy more bitcoin when you pay for something in bitcoin. That's what I did when I bought an older laptop from Overstock with BTC. Actually bought a little more in hopes of a gain in the value.

To quote a couple of age-old phrases in business:  "Adapt or die." And "It's nothing personal.  It's just business." (okay, maybe some of you younger people think that last one was just Donald Trump.)  
In all seriousness, if WU wants to be the innovators they once were with currency transfers, they will pick this up.  The world is changing.  I don't know if bitcoin will be the end currency, but crypto is the future. WU can either come along for the ride and be relevant, or get off at the next stop.  See ya (or not) later.

That's just one of a number of bad predictions, most of them made after he became rich.  You do realize that Windows, while being the most used operating system worldwide, is also not likely to be the easiest, best-performing, or stable, correct?  I'll grant that no one operating system provides all three, but Windows seems to miss the boat.  It's ubiquitous, for sure, unfortunately.  Having too much money can cause you to lose perspective.  His erroneous predictions are evidence of that.

You're still assuming that the protocol exists only as a means to produce and transport the currency. While there is a symbiotic relationship between the two, the currency cannot be anything but bitcoin. The protocol, however, oh, the protocol, can be so much more, thanks to the block chain. It looks like proofofexistence.com is down, but it doesn't really matter-another website could take its place any day to prove the existence of a document at a certain time. Once the hash of a document is in the chain, it's there until bitcoin (seriously uncertain that it ever will) dies.
Look up Decentralized Autonomous Corporations. It will really screw with your brain.

Perhaps I'm uneducated on this point, but I don't think bankers are evil for trying to profit from ignorance and fear.  What I think bankers (the evil ones) are evil for is the inside information they have on coming regulations that have not been disclosed to the public, giving them a leg up on how to make more money, possibly laundering money when they know full well what they're doing, and generally INVOKING the fear and trying to KEEP people ignorant of what they are doing, using a corrupted system of government and media to keep things in motion and keep the general public uninformed.  
I never said or implied it was evil for anyone, even bankers, to try to make a profit.  It all has to do with the approach taken.  I'm sorry if you read me wrong.

Nothing wrong with trying to profit from fat cat ignorance and fear.  It's called capitalism.  Why did he get a downvote?  Implied hypocrisy? I don't think it's hypocritical to want to be profitable. It's a perfectly normal, human trait that should not be frowned on. It's much more difficult to level the playing field with people like Dimon on it, because he has a corrupt government behind him.
Come on, people, don't be afraid to say it:  "I am a capitalist."  You probably wouldn't be on this subreddit if you weren't.  It's not evil.  It generally leads to innovation and a better society if not stifled by regulation.

AOL was a speculative play in 1994. Amazon.com was a speculative play in 1999. Facebook: still a speculative play even with all the popularity. There's just as much of a chance of bitcoin the currency going to zero as there is of it going to 100k. Personally I don't care, and neither should you, because, at the risk of sounding like a judgmental prick, unless you can predict the future, you shouldn't play with more than you can afford to lose. /jp. 
However, Bitcoin the protocol (more specifically the blockchain), well, I kind of have to believe in that, because if it goes away, it means there's no more Internet. If there's no more Internet, some coins going to zero are going to be the least of my worries, and the least of yours. 
Having said that, it's your business, so have fun, whatever happens to it.

I understand your point about bitcoin not being a company, in the same way gold or pork futures are not a company, but currencies and assets themselves also have "investment" value. Companies you don't control are still speculative. Perhaps they're on a different part of the speculation vs. investment spectrum, but they're still speculation. Even starting your own business or renting real estate is speculation to some degree.

Yep, silver gets ugly, but there's still a crapload more uses for it. And since it's cheaper, it wins over gold every time in electrical and industrial uses. I think gold is slightly more conductive, so you can opt for the more expensive electronics, if you must have that slightly lower impedance for whatever reason.

Unless we're nuked, my bet is that seeds would eventually become more valuable than any PM in such a supply or perhaps even technological crisis. If the former happens, well, then we've got more immediate things to worry about than spending money or where our next meal comes from, assuming we survive that long.

The issue is because of the slash.  USD/BTC is indeed US Dollars per bitcoin, but BTCUSD is Bitcoin "in terms of" US Dollars.  Take a look at the Google example using USDEUR:  That's not US Dollars PER Euro (USD/EUR).  It's Euros per US Dollar.  Forex pairs are a PITA because it causes exactly this type of confusion.

@_date: 2013-12-19 19:27:46
Again, I go back to the slash.  Forex pairs don't have slashes, because then they'd be wrong, as math would read it as Currency Numerater per Currency Denominator.  
Forex USDBTC != Mathy USD/BTC. 
For Forex pairs, like you've shown, you have to flip the currencies to make them something meaningful using math.  If you use a slash, it should be assumed you're using math.  If you're not using a slash, it should be assumed you're using the currency pair, hence reversing the math.
See what I mean about the confusion?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:04:29
True, as long as the currency remains stable, but try telling that to the Weimar Republic back in the day, or Argentina now.  Having said that, Bitcoin has yet to prove itself as a stable currency (a LOOOONG way to go), whereas the dollar, relatively speaking, has been stable for years.

I don't know how it all originated, but I suspect it used to be, when the digital Forex markets were forming, the slashes didn't exist in the pairs.  Somehow, through the years, some programmer thought it would be cute to make it look more like math and confuse the hell out of everyone.
