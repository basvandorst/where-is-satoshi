I don't mine, it's just a full node
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:49:16
? My node is definitely a full node
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:18:58
90 down 12.5 up is what I get on get on Speedtest usually
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:16:24
I also wonder if I will get a mail from my ISP one day. But so far nothing.

How to upgrade a full node to Lightning? Is it even possible on Windows or do you need a node running on Linux?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:59:37
Damn, I use Copay as my secondary wallet. A.A. recommended it and I thought it's secure:-( Only did one transaction yet and so far everything seems to be ok.

I suppose OPs salary is still in fiat and just gets converted to BTC before payout. So you're right. The real trick would be to negotiate a guaranteed salary in BTC like for example 0.5 BTC per month.

Why is there so much difference between exchanges? It shows me 14600 on Gdax and 13300 on Bitfinex....
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:07:05
Or wait a few month more and you can sell your Bitcoin Diamond, Super Bitcoin and Bitcoin Uranium also;-)
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:28:47
Yeah, sell me;-)
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:22:44
Done, thank you OP!
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:34:14
Lol, don't wanna support hacking but I have to admit that's pretty funny:-)
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:30:18
If you are still interested I can sell you issue 2 for a bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:13:50
May I ask another question I forgot when I made the post?  
Is the backup in Mycelium done on the phone itself? Should I go offline for that (airplane mode)? Or does the app need net access for backing up?
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:13:06
Never heard that. But South and North Korea are technically still at war because they never signed a peace treatment
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:31:50
Just get a time machine dude
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:20:54
You could use a Bitcoin ATM if there are any where you live. But those usually have high fees (~4%)
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:11:19
Thx, I'm aware of this. I plan on hodling for longer time really, I just said "at least a year" because where I live you have to hodl for at least a year to avoid taxes.
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:56:01
Love the HODL shirts :-) Are they available with the BTC logo also?
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:55:01
Zu Punkt 3: Ja, mir ist schon bewusst, dass man das selbst auch machen kann aber dann muss ich davor ja erst wieder die Bitcoins kaufen, die ich dann auf das Paper-Wallet transferiere. Das Angebot klingt halt so schön unkompliziert, du gehst hin, legst die Kohle auf den Tisch, schnappst dir den Umschlag mit deinen Bitcoins und lagerst den dann irgendwo sicher (Safe, Bankschließfach, etc.). Aber natürlich hast du Recht, ich muss denen halt vertrauen. Hm.  
  
I hope nobody minds that we talk a bit in German;-)

PDF materials and presentations from DEF CON 25 (2017)
  
  
Somebody here mentions that videos are usually released around Dec/Jan because they sell DVDs after the Con. Looks like it's faster this year because some talks already have been released.
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:15:30
Wow, that's much less than I thought. Thx!
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:27:41
I can confirm that! None of my friends has any idea what Bitcoin is. Same for my coworkers. I thought that at least the younger folks would know. I think it's safe to say that BTC hasn't reached mainstream yet.
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:02:09
This guy should be POTUS now! He may be a bit crazy but at least he's crazy in a sympathetic way.
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:22:08
Not all videos from DC25 have been released yet. I heard they sell them when the Con is over and therefore the public releases are delayed
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:56:18
Did we just see a new ATH with $4474?
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:30:47
I even read it on an austrian newspaper today
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:08:59
Yeah, I know. I've spend hours over the last few days googling all this shit but I'm a sceptic (maybe even a bit paranoid;-)) so I rather ask another time, I hope that's ok. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:19:58
What exactly is the advantage of a clean Linux compared to a clean Windows? Serious question!
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:32:37
BTC is almost +800% over the last 12 month, I wouldn't call that "bleeding to death". I agree that we need a solution but there's really no need to rush it.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:12:13
Should have bought Szechuan Sauce at least....
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:17:53
Running a full node won't slow down your downloads if that's what you worry about. But if you have any other services running which require permanent upload you may see some slowdowns depending on your upload speed.  
Be prepared for a lot of uploaded data! My full node is up for 3 weeks now and is currently at 329GB.  
If you are worried because of your IP you can run a full node via TOR also.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:46:36
You're from the US? How much are taxes there?
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:12:25
If you bought your Pixel just to put it in a drawer and hope it will be worth much more in a few years......yeah, that's gambling.....and you will loose;-)  
But srsly, if you are talking about using BTC to actually use them for paying, that's not so much "gambling", although you still could win or loose a quiet high percentage within a few days.  
But most ppl here are Hodlers and talk about BTC as a investment. And yeah, that's pretty much gambling. You may end up rich in a few years, you may loose (almost) everything you invested. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:18:38
True, but that's mostly because ppl usually run their account as admin. I'm no expert on linux but I guess you could run everything on root there also. But yeah, Windows makes it easier for users to trade security for convenience.  
Still, if what OP claims is true, despite he used a old OEM Windows 7 without updates, I think it's very unlikely that maleware was involved unless he was already targeted before and/or there was already maleware or a rootkit on his machine that survived the reinstall. But that's nothing you get easily and without a reason usually.
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:54:49
In Europe it's different from country to country. Here in Austria you only have to pay taxes if you sell your BTC (with profit) within one year. No taxes if you wait at least a year:-)
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:16:13
Can you imagine going to a doctor and ask him to remove your left ball 'cause you promised to Reddit to eat it when Bitcoin hits 10k in 2017?
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:04:12
What? I see 10.08 for BTC and 0.52 for BCC....
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:35:20
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:46:30
Amazing talk, from start to finish! He covers pretty much everything that is important right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:10:20
Hm, ok, but it still seems to go up, 117k right now. Can we rent Googles quantum computer to speed things up a bit?;-)
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:45:47
Are we talking about this?:   
If so, then your private keys are encrypted with AES256. No chance to brutforce this AFAIK. Your best bet is to try every single phrase that comes to your mind and hope that you didn't use a randomly generated phrase by Last Pass. Good luck dude!
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:54:49
Well, thx for the long post but I'm aware what OP did was suboptimal. But some ppl here seem to claim that Windows per se is somehow a huge security risk which I doubt.  
And yeah, I'm aware how long it takes to get a fresh install of Windows updated. I did a fresh install of 8.1 on my old lappy recently and IIRC there were 207 updates before it was done. And that was a current ISO from MS, not some old disc XD Lappy is now serving as a BTC full node:-)
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:43:07
Ok, ok, no need to get rude folks. I'm on this sub for a few month and I haven't seen this question addressed. Sorry for asking something that has been asked before;-)  
So looks like the transaction fees will keep the system alive. Thx for the serious answers! 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:05:27
I love that I don't see any ads on Reddit:-)
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:58:32
At least do a full scan with a your AV and a full scan with Malwarebytes before you do any transactions. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:08:51
I like it! Maybe add a looping for ATHs?;-)
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:14:41
Wow, didn't know it's that easy to run a full node. I believe in Bitcoin and I want to contribute, so I guess I will set up a full node as soon as I find time!  
I have a older laptop (N3520, 8GB RAM) and unlimited broadband (90down/12up), should be good to go, right?  
Lappy is currently running Windows 8.1 but I could install Linux also. Are there any advantages/disadvantages running Windows/Linux? Or doesn't the OS matter at all?
@_date: 2017-10-07 08:30:57
I never click any of those "top search results" which are just ads, no matter what I search for.
