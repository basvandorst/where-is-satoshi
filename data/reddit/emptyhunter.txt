You can't really claim that the pro-Clinton side of the argument is pushing a dubious narrative without much in the way of evidence and then go on to drop "oh and the Clinton foundation is linked with ISIS" afterwards. It undermines your entire point re: outlandish theories with limited evidence.

He's in Canada so the laws are different, but in the US if you have federal student loans (Perkins, etc) you are eligible for something called Income Based Repayment, where they look at how much you earn and assess a monthly payment based on that (up to 15% of your discretionary income) - if you earn too little that payment could be $0. 
If after 25 years you still haven't paid your loans off the remaining balance is forgiven.

It's not exactly easy to prove. We have the blockchain but if the theft is what Gox described it as then it will be difficult to find. The attackers (if they are real) did not just go and transfer 800,000 BTC from one wallet to another. They skimmed off the top and so transferred in smaller amounts.
There are going to be so many relatively small transactions on the blockchain that the transactions we're looking for are literally needles in a haystack. One potential way of finding them is that if the thieves stole the same amount each time we could go and investigate all transactions that meet this profile and follow it from there. 
It's still going to be difficult to do.

If you work for a public agency like you described you are eligible to get your loans forgiven after 10 years rather than 25. 
As far as I understand the balance isn't shifted to taxes either, if after 25 years a balance still remains it's wiped away.

The United States has a completely archaic banking system where a lot of inter-bank transfers go through the Federal Reserve's "Automated Clearing House" (ACH), and the way this system works is: 
Customer places transfer request ---&gt; Bank combines customer transfer requests into a batch ---&gt; Batch gets sent to the Fed for processing at the end of each working day (i.e. not in real time) ---&gt; Request is processed and sent onto the receiving bank next working day (or later) ---&gt; Bank can choose to credit deposit into the account or wait until the funds are transferred through ACH (can take up to 5 days).
There's another system called FedWire which is relatively instantaneous, but that can cost you a fairly large fee (one of my banks charges me $30). Most transfers are actually made using this system (think stock exchanges, corporate finance, etc) but for consumer banking and payroll etc ACH is used. 
Other countries have much more advanced systems than the US. 
There are other systems to use like Paypal or Venmo but you have to get your money out of those systems and they're going to use ACH to do it.

Not to defend the indefensible, but there's no political will to force a new payment system (are we really going to give public money to banks for them to make a better system?) and the US is the world's largest economy: changing to a different system would be incredibly complex.
The US financial system is very different compared to other countries. In many countries you have a set of four or five major banks that control the majority of the market, whereas in the US you have a lot of smaller banks (and many giants), and credit unions. The Federal Reserve bank of NY estimates that [$14 trillion gets moved around on a typical day.]( It would cost a lot of money to adopt a new system and push it out to every bank, and there aren't many people who seem to want to fork out for it. I think it's a total mess (an embarrassment) when you consider that it was quicker for me to get a wire transfer from Barclays in the UK to Bank of America in the US than it is for me to send my mum a few hundred bucks from Bank of America to a Synovus account.

The value of the Euro isn't Greece's problem at all. Their issues run far deeper than that. You or someone else offered comparisons to the United States which I understand to be far removed from reality. I attempted to explain why, that is the only context in which the US is discussed.
Greece's problems are far larger than their currency. Devaluation would be helpful but that doesn't happen when you're a relatively small economy within a monetary union. It also doesn't happen when you burn up all of your goodwill. Greece's main issue is that they're locked in to a currency they have no control over and must borrow in that currency, only no private investors are willing to lend to them. This means the ECB and IMF are their only reliable sources of funding and they have just put that at risk too. Even if Greece abandons the Euro they're going to be in a terrible situation because a new Drachma will be worthless, any foreign investors will have no confidence in the Greek government, and their outstanding debts will continue to be denominated in Euros (any debt from then on will be in Drachmas, but it's hard to see who will lend to them). Greece imports 85% of its needs (food, fuel, products) and will be trying to buy products from abroad/service debts with a worthless currency. Not a promising situation to be in. 
Even if the Euro was worth less it'd be hard to see how Greece would benefit as their economy is in a depression (no domestic sources of capital) and there is almost no investor confidence (no/limited foreign sources of capital). So there's no money for the Greeks to use to re-orient the economy towards export-led growth. The same applies to changing to the Drachma. 
Edit: One final piece of clarification: The US already, believe it or not, has quite the export/manufacturing base. Greece does not. So if the US needed to devalue, they'd stand to benefit as we actually produce a lot of stuff that we can sell to the world. Greece isn't in the same situation and they have no serious natural resources to rely on as a buffer.

Greece has been corrupt for decades and everyone knows it. Nobody pays their taxes correctly, everyone reports less income than they're earning, etc. 
Whenever you wanted to get decent service from the Government you had to bribe the official with a little [gift.]( My heart bleeds for these people but they have to accept some responsibility for not doing more to combat the corruption and overspending.

If you make a claim you provide an evidence based argument, encouraging people to do your research for you is stupid and it's also never going to help you win an argument as you have no control over what that person might find. Just a tip.

After requiring 5 years of bailouts because they were unable to meet their obligations to private bondholders (they required said bondholders to take a large haircut). The IMF consider Greece to be in default and the ECB is legally prohibited from extending support to a country considered in default by the IMF, hence why they cant back up the banks anymore via the European Stability Mechanism. 


That's got everything to do with Greece because Greece cannot devalue as they have zero control over their interest rates and cannot print additional money to devalue. The US always has this option as it has maintained fiscal sovereignty.

The Greek situation is absolutely nothing like the American one and there would have to be significant changes in American policy to expose us to such a situation.
For one, America would have to scrap the dollar and introduce a currency the government has no control over. Secondly, America would need to default on all loans, which we've never done. The main one is the currency though, the only reason the Greek banks are shut is because they aren't being supported by the European Central Bank anymore and are therefore insolvent. The Greek Central Bank can't provide any liquidity support as they don't control the nation's currency.

Iceland isn't going to adopt the Euro, 70% of the people there are against that idea and it's very possible that the Euro will not exist in it's present form in a few years time. I read that they're actually far more likely to adopt the Canadian dollar since Canada has key industries and climates that are similar to Iceland.

Well, we don't have high inflation but I realize you're probably going to dismiss that. The situation in the US is nowhere near as dire as in Greece and is unlikely to ever get that serious: the US has a much more diverse economy than Greece, our public spending is much more sustainable in percentage terms, and we control our own currency. Even if we got into a situation where the value of the dollar is significantly diminished there's a strong chance we'd benefit as we remain the world's 2nd largest exporter (less valuable currency = more people buying your products = more jobs = economic recovery).

The EU isn't on the verge of collapse, but the euro is likely to change over the next few years. Spain and Greece will probably drop out and go back to their respective currencies, but the others will probably stay in the Union. The situation in Greece isn't at all like a German subsidy of Greece, all nations in the EU (Germany being one of the worst offenders) have broken the fiscal rules agreed upon.
Germany, being a country primarily based on manufacturing, actually benefitted from the euro being priced lower because of the southern european economies. The DM was considered the world's most stable hard currency and this would probably have priced German exports pretty high, harming their manufacturing industry. And considering the savage cuts that the IMF and ECB have forced Greece to undertake (and quite stupidly imo) it's not funding some mythical land of 10 hour work weeks.
Youth unemployment is around 50% in Greece, Millions of people are now below the poverty line, Health clinics originally intended for refugees and immigrants in transit are now attracting more and more Greeks who don't have insurance (which never happened before), millions are lining up in soup kitchens for food, and the government is reducing wages by 50%. 
The Greeks bear some blame here, but it isn't really as one sided as it is made out to be.

And then they will ask why you’re moving that much in cash or in a physical asset and suspect a whole bunch of things which could lead to the money being taken even if it is reported. They can seize the money and bring a criminal case against the money itself.

It can't do that as it's a member of the WTO, which prohibits them from devaluing their currency. The Chinese get a lot of flack for devaluation. Most economists actually argue that Germany has benefitted most from the Euro.

Its called a pump and dump. A person with a large amount of shares (in this case bitcoins) sells at a low price flooding the market and causing other holders to panic sell. That person (or people related to him) then buys more than he sold at the incredibly low prices and waits for the market to recover thus increasing his net worth. It's incredibly nefarious but not illegal because it only works if he can create a panic sell in the market. He can go on and do this again and again until the trading house closes trading of that share or shuts down - Since Mt Gox is privately held and unregulated there is no legal constraint requiring them to do this so theoretically they can do this forever if they so choose. Mt Gox has gone down so either the insane amount of traffic has shut their servers down or they have closed for trading to find out the finer details of what happened.

Yeah I saw the message posted but the hacker was attempting a pump and dump, just with someone else's money and not his own. However, Mt Gox's user database has just been leaked so anyone with money in Mt Gox should change their password asap.
I haven't done the math but considering how volatile bitcoin is and the lack of regulatory oversight it would definitely be possible for the person to break even and make money out of a scheme like you described. Bitcoin went to $0.01 and then back up to at least $12 in the span of 10 minutes. All it takes is someone with a lot of coins and who is quick on the trigger to be able to sell off his and buy back more at reduced prices.

I really don't like modern investment banking, but we do actually need a banking system. A banking system allows those "grimy fucks" to lend out their wealth to a person in order for them to get a business off the ground and better themselves, and in turn better society as a whole by increasing the amount of wealth overall. If this change didn't occur we'd still be peasants tilling the fields, because the aristocracy would have all the wealth and any excess wealth would remain unproductive. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 04:30:55
Gox may have your money in the bank account that Dwolla specified so i'd probably try and get your coins out of the way if possible. The DHS can seize and/or freeze Mt. Gox's bank accounts, specifically the ones in the US and therefore under US jurisdiction.

Nice sarcastic remark, but you ignored what I was responding to. If something that is labelled as a currency isn't being used as a means to exchange goods and is deriving most of its value from being traded on an online stock market it isn't a currency but a commodity.
Does it have the potential to become a currency in the future? Yes, of course. Is it going to be one if things continue as they are? No. 
@_date: 2013-03-01 18:59:32

It isn't the first time by a long shot. Things like this have happened all throughout history, mostly in dictatorships and war situations. A good example would be when the Japanese occupied Hong Kong, they outlawed the Hong Kong dollar and mandated all transactions be made in Military Yen.

Yes, and the way they built trade and industry was via a more sophisticated financial system. Growth and economic/social change was very, very slow when everyone was trading under a barter system or a simple money system. I'm not saying that things would have always remained as they were, but when we figured out how to take unproductive capital and funnel it to those who wanted to do something with it we lit a fuse that allowed growth (and therefore change) to occur much quicker.
