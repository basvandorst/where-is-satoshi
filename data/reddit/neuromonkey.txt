I would like an unlisted number, please.
Uh... actually... Huh. Hm.
When you move coins into an exchange, trade for different coins, and withdraw... that's got to be difficult to follow. You'd need to get the exchange's records. If you did this multiple times, through several exchanges... that could be quite a difficult trail to follow.

You mean like door locks and mall cops?
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:51:51
I have a problem with that.

Wow cool, thanks!!!

Interesting. Thanks, good to know!

I've searched for several addresses that have gotten lots of use. Nuthin'.
@_date: 2014-02-12 11:03:27
Good detective work. Strange and interesting!

She isn't a guy, for starters.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:31:39
Yep. I think it'll come out that either Andresen put one over on her, or that she's part of the hoax--possibly with Newsweek's blessing.
I don't think that there's shred of truth to this.
@_date: 2014-01-22 11:29:41

That's their markup. If they're buying the cards at less than face value, they're making money on both ends. If not, their profit isn't huge.
@_date: 2016-12-16 18:49:45
No, see, it's *sciency*. You make a line using the points on a chart, modified by the date, latitude, and longitude of your birth. Totally different.
@_date: 2016-12-17 19:24:15
Huh? I did, in fact. I didn't search reddit, I searched the net with Google. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 20:45:58
I should have, could have, and *did* search first. I searched and read so much that my gf said, "Enough, already." I spent about an hour and a half reading reviews and complaints about them. Not until after the fact, searching for things like, "circle.com stop bitcoin" did I find articles that mention the fact.

Thanks! I sure will.

What's the advantage to donating in bitcoin, other than advertising your site?
@_date: 2012-11-05 15:00:27
You guess correctly.
@_date: 2012-11-05 14:35:08
Pirating TV and movies is one thing. Selling other people's work is another. This steps over the line into the realm of dirtbag.
Also, it's widely available on torrent sites. Why would anyone want to pay random Internet dude for it? Fuck off, spammer.
@_date: 2012-11-05 14:36:13
Yeah, I'd like the one about how you leave reddit and never return.
@_date: 2016-10-21 12:42:35
Well... only some of your assets. (States do, that is. Not the federal gov't.)

Some of my favorite places are dumps.

Thanks, I'll check 'em out now.
Hm. They have a $400 minimum. I need to pay for something that's half that. Thanks, though.

It's creeping into "months..."
@_date: 2013-10-08 15:42:25
I was going to sign up. Your comment changed my mind. Password? No fucking way. 
My bank has a third party data aggregation system, as do many. That's perfectly adequate to verify identity, or they could use the kludge of doing a small transaction that you must then verify. 
Do they really ask for your banking *password??!*  That's irresponsible and stupid. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 02:01:34
Hey, everyone! Let's all donate microscopic amounts to that address just to, like, make a statement and stuff.
...aaaand two days later, it becomes a thing.
@_date: 2013-09-02 14:31:28
I've read that bank transfer purchases of BTC take 4 days w/ coinbase. Is that still the case?

Well, in that case, STOP BLAMEING TEH VICTUM!!!!
@_date: 2013-10-04 01:51:46
Eventually it'll grow too big for its own blood supply, right? Or at least too big to drag around zillions of heads.
...Unless it figures out how to use heads as legs.

The victim, in this case, had ample warning not to do something, which they then did. While they aren't to blame for the work of a thief, they are responsible for their own choices.
If five people tell you, "Don't eat there, everyone who eats there gets food poisoning," that doesn't mean that it isn't the restaurant's fault for serving shit. Deciding to take a risk and eat there would be on you, however.

Newton's 27^th law states that Bitcoin are infinite and exist outside of.
They will be waiting for you when you die. Along with a record of every time you pooped.
@_date: 2013-09-02 18:20:54
Really? I've got to go read that again...  Coinbase says:
*"By linking your bank account with your Coinbase account, you can buy or sell bitcoin in exchange for dollars. These bank transfers take 3-4 business days—when you buy it will take a few days to see the bitcoin in your Coinbase account"...*
bitinstant.com has apparently been shut down. The only quick method of buying BTC seems to be a private sale. eBay sellers charge a big markup, and the nearest localbitcoins.com seller to me is 160+ miles away. People seem to charge a premium for PayPal sales, given the risk of PayPal locking up funds, as they love to do.
Ah HA! Looks like I may be able to go to a Bank of America and deposit cash via [TrustCash!!]( Hopefully this will work.
@_date: 2013-09-02 14:35:15
How about the other way around? What's the speediest method of converting cash to BTC? coinbase enforces a 4 day wait for bank transfers. Do you know eobots cash deposit times?
@_date: 2013-10-04 03:27:04
Hm. What can I buy with 0.00005785 BTC?
I am not good at Bitcoin.

I've been told several times that I could not deposit money into another person's accounts. KeyBank is adamant about it. Chase has told me the same, even with my grandmother in view (she couldn't walk,) with all of her IDs in my hand. Never tried at Wells Fargo.
@_date: 2013-09-03 14:58:06
In response to growing support by several political parties the world over, Bitcoin continues as usual.
One highly-placed Bitcoin insider is quoted as saying, "Yup."
More on this story as it develops... while various federal governments feverishly work to dismantle it.
