There are  problems with what you ask:
1. there is no way to scale ASAP, can you get everybody to agree? I don't think so. So if a scale is implemented, let say by bigger blocks or faster blocks, it will just be a new fork, because there will still be a Bitcoin network with the current rules, some people would support it.
2. How much you think is necessary to scale? You want fees to go to near zero? Do you have an estimation of how much scaling is necessary for that? 8MB blocks? 100MB blocks? 1GB blocks It is easy for an altcoin to say they have support, because they don't have the traffic. How much transaction traffic would flood the network if fees where almost zero? 100 txps? 1000 txps? 10000 txps? 100000 txps? Would you be okay if 99% of nodes fail because they cannot process that much txps? There are blockchains with dynamic block size, but if they have near zero transactions, then it is a feature not used.

Bitcoin is not a scam. 
On the other hand, many cryptocurrencies are centralized in companies which may exercise activities that may be more in their own interest (not to use stronger words).
In the case of Bitcoin, the ecosystem is much more organic, the fact that it has no lead means that there is not a 'godlike' leader with blind followers.
A different thing is people or organizations around Bitcoin. As with anything of value, it will get surrounded with opportunists and con-artists. That is where you'll find scams around Bitcoin as in any other cryptocurrency.

I do care about the tech, I write code.
I do agree with you there is too much hype and most post are about that, I would prefer more technical post, but maybe reddit is not the place.
New concepts beyond blockchain are very exiting, both as bitcoin layers or independent swam topologies. And as bitcoin layers they will allow bitcoin scaling.
Even though the hype has been too much too fast. It is the price expansion that allows for enhancing the security of the Bitcoin blockchain, there is no computer power in the world that could rewrite the blockchain and tamper with the ledger. Greed is part of the equation that pushes for more advanced mining equipment which pushes the mining difficulty higher, which protects the blockchain.

I agree with the OP! Bcash is a scam with very powerful market tricks.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:28:29
No, most cryptocurrencies are not secured because there is no much computational resources building their blockchain.
If you take for BCH for example, it has about 13% the computational resources that Bitcoin has. If a couple of the biggest Bitcoin mining pools decide to attack the BCH blockchain and rewrite 1 day or 2 days of history, erasing all the coinbase generated and subsequent transactions, they could.
It is very improbable they do it, but it could happen and they would make allot of money by coordinating trading/shorting.
The same happens in other blockchains that use GPUs, if they use a small fraction of all the global mining GPU stock, then they may get manipulated.

When I mean slightly more I mean they cannot scale. Scaling means to go 1000x or 1000000x or 1000000000x. a 10x is not scaling.
They could not handle this king of load because actually the fees are containing the real load users want to have, if where were no fees, txps would be 100x more than today. Which blockchain can handle that? And if they do, they would be such a success that txps would scale to 10000x in a few months (including all spammers).
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:32:44
Yes, bitcoin will need to increase block size in the future. But also other technologies could emerge, like making a 3rd layer LN on top of another 2nd layer. This way you could have 1 billion people making even more than 3 tx/year to open and close channels on top of the 2nd layer, and that 2nd layer would open/close channels into the blockchain less often.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:47:39
Not really, you should research for yourself before posting, you can get misled or you can mislead other people.
The blockchain will not die if LN is adopted because the main source of income for miners is the block reward (12.5 BTC now), not the fees collected. There are even miners that don't care about putting transactions in blocks, mining essentially empty blocks. With the network congested as of now, fees can become a good part of miner's income. But if you look a other cryptocurrencies, many the have basically few transactions an almost no fee collected.
With LN, the basic idea is that you make a transaction but instead of publishing to the network, you keep it private with your counterpart, if you later buy more, you make another transaction for the sum amount, these transactions are mutually exclusive, so only one could latter end in the blockchain. And you continue transacting it needs to settle in the blockchain. Technically this works so no one can robe the other and instead of just working between 2 parties it can work with more.
Bcash tries to solve the scaling issue by making blocks 8 times bigger. But 8x is not much. Scaling solutions are measured in 10^n where n needs to be big enough.

Well, really nothing has intrinsic value. Gold scarcity and physical properties has value to us humans and we call that intrinsic value, if within 100 years there is a technological breakthrough that would allow to cheaply create any element with the likes of fusion energy, then we could make all the gold we may want and it may not be scarce anymore, also space mining could start bringing back thousands tones of gold.
If gold looses only its scarcity one day, it will loose it value.
Bitcoin is more than just a commodity/currency to trade or use just for payment. Right now its mainnet blockchain is the most secure ledger in the planet, its data (transaction history) is more protected and transparent than anything else you can imagine. That is what brought me to BTC and gave it any value. Of course this could change in the future, who can know, but it is more than just a token to trade or pay with.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:27:47
Yes, Monero is implementing exiting technologies, adjustable blocksize can eliminate fee bottlenecks, but if it had the current transaction traffic Bitcoin has now, how many MB/s or GB/s per day would its blockchain grow? If fees where to keep low, the how much more traffic could there be? Even with bulletproof Monero has large transaction size (of course it implements features like confidential transactions the Bitcoin does not have, but that has a cost in size and processing power).
What would you need to process on-chain transactions for a billion people transacting many times every day? In terms of space and mostly cpu performance we are screw in any cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Monero, Bcash, LTC, ETH, you name it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:24:39
I was not referring to your ELI5, but to your reply.
Yes, blockchain reward diminishes with time to half every 4 years aprox.
But you need to understand that the computational requirement to mine the blocks is not a problem, it is actually part of what makes the blockchain work. 
It is self regulated, if miners get less reward in BTC and/or BTC lowers in price, then the less efficient miners would stop and mining difficulty would lower until it is profitable for the active miners.
It is not desirable that the difficulty lowers, but it self regulate to maintain the blockchain running. The 'insane computational requirements' is actually what keeps the blockchain secure and gives it value. There is no power in the world to change a transaction buried deep enough in the blockchain. You cannot say the same about any bank's accounting system which can be manipulated by an administrator. 
And for LN to work, you need to open a channel, that means to put a transaction in the blockchain (paying fees). You don't really move the anything to a sidechain, just an special transaction that locks BTC in the blockchain under certain rules. Then you can transact with those BTC as many times as you like in LN doing micro transactions if you want, there is no limit to the number of transactions, just the total BTC amount you locked. Then a final transaction needs to go to the blockchain to pay for all the LN activity you did, this final transaction needs to pay fees, but it covers as many payments done in the LN network as you are willing to do, thousands or more if necessary. And by using segwit transactions you actually have to pay less fees than normal transactions since they use less of the 1MB space.
The hope is that this will lower the number of transactions per second in the bitcoin network so fees (which are voluntary) can lower.

I was expecting that because I didn't give any explanation on purpose.
Money is currency, but currency is not money because it lacks 'store of value' over long periods of time.
I guess in current times people have forgotten what used to be considered money. For thousands of years gold was used as money. Paper notes (currency) were introduced as claim checks on money (for the convenience of carrying and validating them).
Less than 100 years ago, a dollar bill was a legal tender note payable in gold coins to the bearer of the bill.
So a dollar bill was pretty much a certificate of ownership of gold. 
Gold was considered money. A dollar bill was only considered a currency easier to handle and validate than gold.
The dollar was not considered money because it lacked the 'store of value' property, so it was pegged to gold in order to enable it as 'store of value'.
Since 1971 the dollar is not pegged to gold, and a whole generation is used to considering the dollar (and other currencies) as money and gold as a commodity. Now there is not much need to differentiate the terms money and currency, so people tend to think they mean the same thing.
Bitcoin on the other hand is a way to replicate gold, giving it the properties of both money and currency. Current Bitcoin acceptance in the world is small, so it is still not yet a good store of value, which I hope will change.

Technically, for the buyer and seller to setup an escrow address with an arbitrator, they need a public key from the arbitrator.
From a business perspective, it depends on how the arbitrator wants to work.
As an example, an arbitrator could publish, that he would give arbitration services over transactions within the US (the buyer and seller within the US) over amounts of 10 BTC, and just publish its public key. In this case the buyer and seller could check the services given by the arbitrator, and just use the published public key to transact.
The escrow model may cost little extra to the buyer (compared to a normal bitcoin transaction) since 2 transactions are involved (buyer-&gt;escrow, escrow-&gt;seller) there are 2 fees involved. 
And it is extra work for the buyer to setup the escrow address (which is to mix 3 public keys from the buyer, the seller and the arbitrator), to transfer to this escrow address, and to sign the payment to the seller once he is satisfied with his purchase (or delivery).
So I see these escrow transactions used in big purchases, like maybe ordering a car, or buying a house. I wouldn't use it to pay a coffee.
And yes, the buyer could 'forget' to sign the final payment to the seller, which would make the seller pay for the arbitrator fees. Thus costing time and bitcoins to the seller. I guess for this the seller should use son king of scoring of buyers. I guess this transactions would need to disclose personal data (name, address) between buyer and seller so the arbitrator can decide anything, so scoring could be possible.

It is common for big companies to shift toward setting execution targets and managing to accomplish them.

What I value the most is that Bitcoin is a system of trust.
Its blockchain is a decentralized public ledger that no one can tamper with.
Once a transaction is put on record in this ledger, every new page (block) on the ledger helps confirm all the previous pages.
So tomorrow no one can deny a transaction that was confirmed yesterday.
And this system of trust works without actually trusting anyone in the network, because it is based on trusting the major consensus that is based on the proof of work protocol of Bitcoin.

Computers running bitcoin mining software generates 25 bitcoins worldwide every 10 minutes.
This is the emission of the currency, but instead of being emitted by a central bank at their discretion, it is emitted by mining computers at a rate of 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes aprox.
Anyone can setup a mining computer and he would get is share depending on his computer's hashrate.

You are right, but in the case of my company, some one stole pretty much public data, which is what you can see in the credit card (name, numbers and date).
Actually some employees lost money because of the timing to report the issue (between getting email paper balances and everything) and a few transactions were not cover by insurance.
With respect to private keys, that is private information as opposed to public information that is written on top of a CC that you have take out when you pay, and some times hand it over to someone.
Of course bitcoins can be stolen if a private key is stolen. But tell me something in the world that really cannot be stolen.

There are several ways:
You buy bitcoins in a xchange website (bitsamp, btc-e, or others): 
* you create an account on the website.
* you transfer Lira or USD to the website (bank transfer).
* you wait for the funds to appear in the website.
* you place an order to buy bitcoins with the available funds (you can buy at the spot price or place an order at a lower price and wait until somebody else puts a sell order at your price).
* you withdraw the bitcoins to your own wallet, which should be well protected with good password encryption, several backup copies, up to even cold storage of the private keys.
This way you own the bitcoins yourself. So latter you do whatever you want with them.
You could do other things too:
* leave the bitcoins in a exchange: not very safe, because you are trusting them not to screw up their service for a long time. Maybe you could live a small amount just to cash out quickly if needed.
* move your bitcoins to another online provider like blockchain.info, I haven't used their service. Again, at most put a little bit if you want.
* buy bitcoins in localbitcoins where sellers and buyers get in contact and do the actual Lira or USD transaction directly between themselves (face to face or through a bank transfer). This may be a little risky, so you could do it in small quantities.

That means that a consensus should be made to bail them out, risking a major fork conflict which could plunge the price, creating a scenario for double spending attacks, and also it would help depreciate everybody's BTC in at least 6% by bringing 750k BTC back in circulation.

I have the same problem, I did several withdraws 3 days ago, one of them got stuck and hasn't appear in blockchain.info. The rest appear instantly.
In this other post, there was a mention a site to check mtgox transactions. But I don't know if it is a scam or what.
At least, it appears that for some withdraw transactions they build up them with too many tiny inbound transactions to spend, making the withdraw transaction too big so it is not propagated far on the p2p network or not mined. 
So mtgox may be missing doing some smart consolidation of deposit transactions thus getting them in problems with some withdraws not getting confirmed.
They have to fix them by double spend one of the inbound transactions, rendering the withdraw invalid, and publishing a new withdraw transaction. A real mess.
If this problem is real with them, I guess it is not a good idea to withdraw any big amounts of BTC in a single withdraw, but also not too small amounts that would make you loose too much in fees for several withdraws.
Anyway I have also been waiting for 3 days with no answer to my support requests.

It is very good that people are curious and check or audit Bitcoin and what is going on under the hood.
But this type of posting suggesting malicious intend embedded in some bitcoin software is actually negligence and making just FUD.
The bitcoin protocol takes in account the ownership of bitcoins by tracking transactions. And transactions are considered unspent or spent (that meaning totally spent). 
This optimization have great advantages since by protocol, only standing unspent transactions have to be check in order to validate new transactions.
So if you receive 2 BTC in one inbound transaction, and you want to send 0.5 BTC to someone, you'll have to spend the inbound transaction and send back to yourself the remaining 1.5 BTC to what is called a change address. This is done automatically by the software.
Bitcoin-qt will use a new change address every time it needs to send a change back to you for privacy issues. 
This change address has its own private key and it is stored in the wallet file (wallet.dat). 
Actually, Bitcoin-qt precreates 100 private keys, 99 of which are reserve and will be used if you want a new address or if a new change address is needed. If it runs out of these reserve addresses, it will create more (and you should backup your wallet again, old backups won't have the new addresses).
What is a little annoying about Bitcoin-qt is that these change addresses are not shown (I guess in order to simplify the interface and the reports). 
So once a person start to discover this 'strange' behavior it can get spooky. It is common for people first to ask in a forum where they would get good answers, but posting it in a blog is king of embarrassing once you realize you didn't do your due diligence first.

Money vs currency is a meaninless distinction since about 40 years. But for a much longer time it used to be an important distinction.
Money is currency, but currency is not money because it lacks 'store of value' over long periods of time.
And up to 1971, gold was considered money, nothing else. Actually Bitcoin is modeled as gold. 


Actually gold was seen about 5000 years ago in Egypt to have special properties (properties like bitcoin) that enabled trading, and it wasn't until Athens 2500 years ago that it became money in the form of fungible coins and free markets.

It was the same for early adopters. They had to use some cheap hardware and spend little electricity, but if was not free. Plus they were getting a lot of pretty much worthless and useless bitcoins at the time.
Then, when bitcoins became worth something, miners switched to expensive GPUs, which used a lot of electricity to get more bitcoins. GPUs at least can be used for other purposes.
Now you have to buy expensive and specialized hardware, use some electricity, and you get just a little bit of bitcoins with are worth a lot. (Now a GPU is pretty much useless for bitcoin).
At the end it is just a free market where people start/stop mining based on profit expectation (or just to support the protocol) that result from all the media exposure (people in favor, people against, hardware sellers), events happening, and public trading information (mostly legit, but you knows really).

There is an escrow capability in bitcoin protocol itself by the use of multi-signature transactions, which are not well known.
The simplest way is by using a 2 out of 3 signature transaction between the buyer, the seller and an arbitrator.
This interesting advantages, if the buyer and seller are in agreement about the payment and the delivery are done, they close the deal by signing the transaction without the need of the arbitrator (and his fees).
If the seller does deliver the goods, and the buyer refuses to sign the transaction, then the seller can request the arbitrator to step in and check the facts, if he deems that the agreement and delivery was sound, he will sign the transaction, completing the 2 out 3 signatures required with the seller, getting a fee for his services.
On the other hand, if the seller doesn't deliver, the buyer doesn't sign and the transaction is not published. The sell could call the arbitrator, but with no proof of delivery, the buyer is protected.
With the current bitcoin volatility this mechanism is not very useful because the transaction (bitcoin transfer) is completed after the delivery of goods, which may take a time. But maybe in the future it can become useful.

Anyway, thanks for the  link.
I just finished setting up my own p2pool node. Any bit of help to secure the network is great.

p2pools ( should be promoted. These pools are not centralized but work on a peer to peer basis of small pool nodes. Each pool node can have several miners.
Miners within a p2pool node get their income on a share basis in the p2pool node. And at the same time the p2pool node will participate on the p2pool network to get its fare share (using a trust-less ledger similar to bitcoin's blockchain).
So the only thing is to connect your miners to a p2pool node.
If you don't trust any, you can setup one quite easy (follow the instructions form the above link), so you can participate on this trust-less combined mining.
ONE THING, the pool at  IS NOT base on p2pool protocol. They just used name and they are a regular centralized pool from what I understand.
You can even promote p2pool by donating BTCs to the p2pool network current miners (look at the p2pool wiki).

A simplified calculation could be:
Half bitcoins were mined in the first 4 years: 10500000 (=21000000/2).
Half of that will be mined in the next 4 years: 5250000.
We are in the fifth year, that means this year started with: 11812500 (=10500000+5250000/4). And this year there should be about 1312500 (=5250000/4)
That would give a 11.1% annual inflation (=1312500/11812500) this year.
Of course that is a simple calculation, the network difficulty growing like it has been doing is making this higher.
I have no idea where the 2% comes from.

If you send some bitcoins to some trading website (or this poker house), those bitcoins will become part of all the bitcoins of this site's wallet.
And since they get bitcoins from some users, later other users request withdraws, which the the site's computer system executes by sending the requested bitcoins out of the wallet, so by change it could be the ones that you sent in earlier. 
It is like cashier in a poker house, people come in and give cash for some tokens, and when someone goes home, he redeems the tokens he is holding for cash, he is not going receive be the same bills that he passed when he came in, just the correct amount from whatever bills are on top of the cashier's drawer.
The main problem with many website is that they must account correctly for all the money coming in (bitcoins or something else), if they missed listening to the event of a deposit in their wallet because some of their software sub-system had to be rebooted or has a bug and is failing to detect or commit to their database a percentage of the deposits, then it is a pain to deal with this site for all emails that have to be exchange and all the stress, and it can take several days to get sorted out.
Of course, this is in the case that they are honest (and inept of course for having a buggy system). If you are dealing with a dishonest website, nothing good can come out of it.

The credit card number is not private information, neither is the name of the card holder. Private information is something you don't share (with strangers at least). 
When you pay with a CC, you take it out and you are disclosing its information if anyone is trying to take a peek.
So while you pay, a photo of your card could be made, or your card could be cloned, and now someone else knows the cardholder name, card number, and date of expiration (and the 3 digits extra security in the back).
Also, from the time the card assigned to you, then printed, to the time you receive it you are trusting no one in chain will steal the data.
For security measures, normally 3 categories are used to classify a proof that you are indeed you:
- By something that you know (a secret)
- By something that only you have (a key)
- By something that identifies you (fingerprint, dna, retina pattern)
And normally to be secure, two of these methods are combined. (So when you see in a scifi movie that they only use a retina scanner to identify someone in a top security facility, it is just bullshit.)
In the case of a CC, you are using just something that you have, and that can be copied easily with just a photo.
A CC with pin, is more secure, because it is using both something you have and something you know.
Also a CC with chip is good, because it is not easy to clone, but it could be stolen and used. So a CC with chip and pin would be a much more secure CC.

There are many wallet software, some you install in your PC others are based on online web sites.
Both have their advantage and drawbacks.
Local software in your PC means that you have to be careful on your PC security and making backups. bitcoin-qt is one of the software available at bitcoin.org. You can even protect your wallet (a file named wallet.dat which you shoud backup regularly) with password , which is needed to send bitcoins to a third party. But be careful, if you loose the password, it impossible with current technology to crack a 15 character long password. And there are a lot of Windows malware that will try to steal your wallet.
Online wallets means that you put your trust in a website to run your wallet and there have been a few incidents in the past.
Bitcoin-qt is a full node software and will download the whole bitcoin blockchain (5 years of ledger) in your computer, this is about 16 GB now, this could take a whole day. There is a new bitcoin wallet which is a lighter version that will download only information relevant to your transactions.
Every wallet has at least 1 public address to receive bitcoins (you can add as many as you want to separate acounts), so some one else can send you a transaction.
To gather bitcoins, you can mine them. Nowadays, specialized hardware is needed (asic miners) which are not cheap. The alternative is to buy bitcoins, either in a trading web site or other in person with someone selling. localbitcoin.com helps buyers and sellers meet online and agree on a form of payment (in person, bank transfer), and localbitcoin works as a escrow service, so they will hold the seller's bitcoins until confirmation from him that he received the money.

Yes, gold was money.
USD was a substitute used as currency. Its value derived from its validity to be exchange back to gold (the government had to honor this).
Now the USD value derives from a future promise of dept payment with interest in USD. So it is this future promise that gives value to the USD, and this future promise has taken the place of gold as 'money'.
That is why people tend to think that the USD is money, but it is not, it is currency. Now the money behind is so intangible (the future promise of dept payment) that people mistakenly think the USD is the money. 
If this future promise is broken, then the 'money' behind the currency is gone, and the currency loses its value. This has always happened in history to FIAT currencies.
That is why bitcoin stands on itself as money, it is backed by its own protocol. So it can be considered not only as currency, but as money too. Of course, the 'store of value' is not there yet, but that is because of the size of the market that has to grow still.

It is not just security issues, it also about race conditions. Most programmers don't know what a semaphore is. Most softwares that are used concurrently by multiple users, or even concurrently by the same user are vulnerable in some degree to race conditions because the software designers were not aware of db transaction isolation issues or other concurrency issues when managing resources that are not thread safe.

A fork is an event where miners of the network find 2 independent solutions for the same block number and then 2 blockchain versions start to grow on these 2 solutions.
This is very rare, what is very common is for one of these 2 independent solutions to be orphaned (published and then dropped by the rest). This happens a few times a day or so.
About a year ago if I am not mistaken there was a fork that lasted a few hours. It was due to a new release of the software that had a different behavior than the prior version (still massively deployed), actually the new release fixed an unknown bug that existed in previous versions and this accounted for a behavior change.
But the community was quit to fix the problem and the fork race stopped.
If you send a transaction while there is a fork (and it is not an intended fork to scam people and you are not participating). It is most probable that your transaction will be confirmed in both versions of the blockchain because your transaction will propagate randomly through the network, so it shouldn't matter which version prevails. You may try to double spend, but without much control of targeting which version of the fork.
Now if some bad people are making the fork to try to make a double spend attack on someone, they still need a lot of computing power to compete with the rest of the miners, and time when to publish double spend transactions. Most probably they would target merchants that don't care to confirm transactions to complete a trade.

There are already tested contingency plans to change the bitcoin protocol in cases of 50% attacks.
Actually the bitcoin blockchain is a very good way of voting for changes, like: lets change the 10 min/block to 2 min/block from block  (of course changing reward from 25 to 5 btc per block to compensate).
If a patch now is proposed, debated, tested and published to take that in account, without changing anything now, but adding a message in mined blocks that the miner is subscribing then we would have real time feed of adoption. The patch would for example enforce the proposed change beginning from the future block  if over 50% of blocks from  to  subscribe (about 3 months), or it would discard automatically the change if it is not over 50%.
So it is not impossible to make changes, they can actually be planed and adopted automatically, both for miners and users (wallet software).
And the current hashing algorithms or 8 decimal digits can be changed this way.

Bitcoin escrow will cost zero if buyer and merchant settle (this is, merchant delivers the goods, buyer accept the goods and both liberate the escrow). This should be how majority of transactions should occur.
Any escrow service fees will only be collected by the arbitrator if the buyer and seller don't settle and one of them involves the arbitrator.
Actually, the arbitrator doesn't know that he was selected for a particular escrow transaction until it is involved by the buyer or seller, if he ever gets involved.
So only in case of a dispute, the arbitrator will do any actual work of reviewing the facts and give sentence (this is help move the bitcoins in escrow to the rightful owner) for a fee.

You will always be able to receive coins on your original address.
Every time you send bitcoins, the transaction sends you back some change to a new 'change' address in your wallet.
This is because, for validation purposes, a whole inbound transaction to your wallet is consumed completely (or more than one) to make an outbound transaction.
Let's say you you have 3 bitcoins you got in 1 transaction to your wallet. If you send 2 bitcoins to a friend, you are redeeming this 3 bitcoin inbound transaction and making a 2 bitcoin transaction to your friend and a 1 bitcoin transaction to yourself in a 'change' address.
This is tricky because you don't see this 'change' address visible in the wallet, but it is recorded in the wallet file.
You can also create more receiving address and label them for order purposes. So you send a different address to different people, and you know you sent you some bitcoins by looking which address is receiving coins.
All receiving address, including the original will continue to receive coins as long as you don't loose your wallet. 
With a wallet clients like bitcoin-qt is always good to backup the wallet every time you make a new address or you send coins, because you may not know if the new address or the new 'change' address is in in your old backup (the current version preloads 100 address the first time, one is used as the original address and the rest are reserved and are used each time you add a new receiving address or an outbound transaction needs a 'change' address, after these 100 address are used, any new address created won't be in your original backup).

I got no funny transactions on my debit card. Buy after a couple of days the card was locked (too many attempts with the wrong password).

If I buy a pen in 100 USD and I return it a week latter it is normal to expect a refund of 100 USD, which doesn't mean a rollback of the original transaction (I may have paid with a credit card and get a refund in cash).
If I paid this 100 USD bill with 0.1 BTC, I am not expecting to get 0.1 BTC back in a refund. Legally there is an invoice for 100 USD, with taxes and everything.

The protocol of sending some amount to an address is based on consuming completely a previous incoming transaction to your wallet (or more than one transaction, depending on the amounts), the difference is send back to your wallet in a new address.
So if you send 0.1 BTC to someone, and you had a previous income transaction of 0.3 BTC, you will make a transaction of 0.3. In these transaction 0.1 BTC will go to the intended person and 0.2 back to you.

The installation steps are very simple. Basically you need python, download from github, run it, and point your miners with a BTC payout address as username.
You will earn your portion of the 25+fees BTC payouts for every share you get in the p2pnetwork (at 100GH/s you get a share in about 6.5 hours). I am not sure if shares stands in the payout for 24 hours or more than that. But, for example if after you get a share, the P2Pool network finds a couple of blocks in the same day, you'll get paid twice for that share in proportion to all still standing shares in the P2Pool network.

Well, putting aside fincen rules. An exchange is pretty much transmitting purchasing power (money or the like), they a receiving deposits and sending withdraws on behalf of users, so they can easily be used by users to launder virtual currencies because the public digital trail pretty much ends at the deposits. 
An exchange can pretty much be used as a tumbler. A user can deposit 10 bitcoins and then just do several small withdraws which most probably will spend bitcoin transactions associated to other users' deposits pretty much at random (since the exchange's wallet will just use any best matching inbound transactions to spend for the outbound transaction of the withdraw).

Well, the blockchain actually locks very much like a paper archive of land ownership record. The way records are voided when ownership is transferred or a property is divided or joined is very much the same in method.
The way records are joined together in sequential books is similar to transactions in blocks on the blockchain. 
You can also trace the ownership of a propery back to the first owner the same way and with the same limitations than tracing back the ownership of some bitcoins.
Of course bitcoin adds cryptography, decentralization and hash mining to protect old records.
So I see Bitcoin more as an ownership record system. 
If what it is owned (bitcoins) is viewed by many in a fungible way then it acts as a currency (my 0.1 BTC has the same purchasing power than your 0.1 BTC).
If some records are viewed not as currency but as something else, like ownership of a company, then for some people those bitcoins have another meaning.
The main use, as it was invented, is as currency. But the ability to trace back ownership is something extra that currency and money do not have, and this gives bitcoin the ability to be also a digital property.
This means that is a group of people honor by contract that certain bitcoin records represent something in the physical world, like an IOU in certain assets. Then ownership of these bitcoins can be moved around in the blockchain and the standing owner can then claim the corresponding assets.

You don't only need the 50+%, you need it for ever.
If a group of miners with 50+% capacity decides to ignore this address, they could pull it off. But if 3 months later they loose their majority position, some other miner will process the transaction, and it will get burred in the blockchain because the new majority would not care.
Let say a week later the original group grows back to 50+%, it will be too late, because the transaction will have over 1000 confirmations. This group would not dare to make a branch 1000 blocks back. It could take them months to catch up if they keep above 50% (minimum would be a week if they add 100%), and in the process they would destroy Bitcoin with thousands of blocks becoming unconfirmed, which would be exploited by bunch of people by doing double spends.

localbitcoins' escrow is an internal escrow in their system.
On the other hand, Bitcoin do allow to make escrow payments on the bitcoin network (and blockchain) through the use on 2-of-3 multisig transactions. Where the buyer sends bitcoins to an escrow address (those starting with a '3') and then the seller can get those bitcoins when the buyer is happy with the purchase and co-signs the transaction from the escrow address to the seller's address.
In case the buyer is not happy because he did not get his purchased items, or in case the seller did deliver, but the buyer doesn't co-sign the second transaction, a third party can be ask to decide (an arbitrator previously selected in agreement between buyer and seller). The arbitrator will ponder the evidence and co-sign the transfer to either redeem the buyer or pay the seller (and charge a fee).
The interesting thing is that the arbitrator is not needed if the buyer and seller transact properly, in which case no fee is charged. He won't even know that a transaction is going on unless the buyer or seller ask him to step in. This is when he charges a fee for the actual work of checking facts and deciding who is right.
This is not very much used yet. Current volatility doesn't play in favor of having bitcoins in an escrow for a purchase with a mail delivery, for example. Current wallet clients can make 2-of-3 multisig transactions, but it is not very user friendly yet.

Very good news indeed!
But just out of academic curiosity:


Does that means that if any country along the way 'designates Bitcoin as legal tender and that circulates and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange on the country of issuance', then FinCEN would consider Bitcoin as a Real Currency instead of a Virtual Currency? (still the 'country of issuance' part is debatable, but anyway Bitcoin is issued in practically all countries in the World by miners).
It would by funny to see that situation!

This is the normal behavior when you send any amount. 
In order to send an amount, at least one previous incoming transaction to your wallet is completely spend (completely used). This is the part of Bitcoin protocol.
So it looks like a previous 1.05 BTC incoming transaction was selected by your wallet to send the 0.105 BTC. The rest (0.945 BTC) was sent back to a new change address in your bitcoin-qt wallet as change. 
The most confusing part is that this new change address is not listed in the graphics interface of the wallet, and you don't see the 0.945 BTC leaving and returning, you only see 0.105 BTC leaving. You should see in the transaction history that 0.105 were send, and that your balance is as expected.
Also, every time you send BTCs, any change BTCs are send back in a new (and different) change address. This is confusing but it helps privacy.
Also, bitcoin-qt creates wallets with 100 addresses (1 is pre-assigned for receiving, the rest are reserve if you want more receiving addresses and also for change addresses), if you use them all, any old backup will not contain any new addresses (from 101 an so on). So you'll have to backup your wallet again.

Let me put it in another way.
I pay you 100 USD with my International credit card, and let's say it is issued in Argentina (660 ARS by conversion rate).
And a couple of weeks latter I ask for a refund 100 USD and you give it back. What will happen to my credit card balance?
I will not necessarily get 660 ARS back, but it will depend on the current conversion rate used by the bank.

Yes, they can still gather the personal info you mention. But by paying by credit card, they could get all your credit card info: number, expiration day, owner's name, validation number. Si they can charge your card.
This has happened to me twice, once with my brand new company CC that I never used (actually someone stole the whole list of employees' CC and started making several transactions in central america, new zealand and uk for trip related stuff.
The second time it was with a credit card that I hadn't used in over 2 years and was stored at home.
If you happened to have insurance, it is ok (I was, but may take up to 5 months to clear where I am).
In person CC or DC payments can get the card/pin cloned, which is also trending topic where I live.

I would stress out that Mt.Gox has a big procedure issue with the 'transaction did not go through' claims.
A transaction not going through does not happens because it got simply 'lost in the network'. If their custom system generated the transaction, at least they should have a node trying to broadcast the transaction, with probably several broadcast that made it to some random peers.
To take a decision to erase the transaction from their system and thus stop broadcasting it is in no way assuring that the transaction wont end up confirmed in the blockchain in the future (in the next minute or next month) because there is no way to know the information flow after each broadcast attempt made it to a peer.
Even with no malleability attack or with a core change to stop malleability, there is no way to be sure the transaction wont make it to the blockchain by just deleting it from your node.
The only way to be sure that such stuck transaction will never make it to the blockchain is to spend at least one of its inputs first on another transaction (and getting it confirmed first).
So even with a core change to end with malleability, Mt.Gox (or any other exchange or any bitcoin user) facing a claim that a 'transaction did not go through' should not just attempt to wipe out the transaction (like recreating the wallet from the private keys) and issue a refund or a new transaction. They should first secure that the claimed transaction is effectively dropped by the whole network by double spending one of its inputs.

Well, using a credit or debit card processor, domestic or international is legally the same thing than using a bitcoin processor that convert 100% to USD.
The client just orders the processor to transfer an X amount of USD to the seller. The way the processor accounts the client's assets or debts is not relevant.
What about gold or silver bullion backed credit card? They are backed on a commodity. Would it be illegal to use them to buy alcohol even though they are indistinguishable from traditional cards by using the POS and electronics channels? What about bitcoin backed credit cards?

You can:
a- connect to any p2pool node using your bitcoin payout address as user and anything as password. There is a list of public notes here:  The the webpage of the nodes, you'll find information of your performance and standing payout. not very user friendly, but the info is there.
b- install a p2pool node for your miners (and make it public of others if you like). The software is easy to install, just need python, download the software and run it (it is python scripts, no need to compile anything). You'll need to have a bitcoin wallet running as the p2pool node fetch work from the wallet.

It is basically the same in the management of bitcoins:
An escrow service receives bitcoins from person A, then person B makes business with A (by some mean of agreement), then the escrow service is notified, then the escrow service releases the bitcoins to B, then B withdraws bitcoins.
An exchange receives bitcoins from person A, then person B makes business with A (a sell offer by A matches a buying offer by B), then the exchange is notified by itselft and releases the bitcoins to B, then B withdraw bitcoins.

I don't think it is their hot wallet being empty.
I tried to withdraw last week and they even gave me a transaction Id. But the transaction was not published. To be able to give a transaction Id, they have to create a bitcoin transaction with specific input transactions to spend. If they had the hot wallet empty they would have any transactions to spend or they would just be giving fake Ids.
My withdraw did not work. After a week they refunded my balance. But I am still waiting for the withdraw fee to be refunded.

I just added the explanation. Sorry I deliberately didn't explain it in order to have people thinking.
You can read the thread for my new comments, but the main points are:
Money is currency, but currency is not money because it lacks 'store of value' over long periods of time.
Until 1971 only gold was considered money. The USD (a currency) used to be backed by gold, now it is backed by future promise of dept payments. Since then, people have lost the distinction and are used to consider gold as commodity (at least in western developed countries).
That is why Bitcoin is modeled after gold (and not the USD, lol). Because gold was the best money.
And Bitcoin model is better money than gold, because we don't know if a huge gold mine could be discovered that will flood the markets or a gold meteorite could fall some day.
And Bitcoin is a better currency, because it is easy to validate and divide.

MtGox could have ran into the same problem even if the transaction malleability was not possible.
MtGox had a bugged procedure to deal with bitcoin withdraw claims. When a customer claims a problem with a withdraw, and the withdraw is definitely not appearing in the blockchain, it can be caused by many things going wrong, a couple of examples:
* They had a glitch in their system and the transaction was not broadcasted.
* They where under some network problem or attack that stopped the transaction from reaching honest nodes in the network.
Despite the actual cause, the only way to securely manage the claim is:
* double spend one of the inputs of the withdraw transaction and wait enough confirmations. This would render the withdraw transaction invalid so it would be purged by the network (if it ever was around) and guarantee that it will never appear in the blockchain.  
* then refund the bitcoins in the balance or issue a new withdraw.
They clearly were not invalidating the conflicting withdraw with a double spend. They were clumsily assuming that if the transaction wasn't getting confirmed then it wouldn't ever get confirmed in the future.

Split your balance in thousands of 0.05 BTC addresses is also messy to manage afterward.
I would recommend you to split in powers of 2: a 0.05 BTC address, a 0.1 BTC addess, a 0.2 BTC address, a 0.4 BTC adress, and so on.
You can also wait for the mempool to clear, and pay less than 1 satoshi per byte (meaning less that 1000 per KB). Now the mempool is quite full, but it was clearing up usually on weekend nights until last week.

You can see at least a partial balance.
If you open Bitcoin Core with your wallet.dat in the .bitcoin directory, then even without syncing the whole blockchain you can go to the receiving address menu and see the receiving addresses stored in your old wallet file.
Then you can look the balance of each receiving address in 
This will give a partial balance, not the total balance since more receiving address could have been made in your wallet after you made the backup. Also, if you sent some coins in the past, then you could have some bitcoins in change addresses which are not shown as part of the receiving addresses.
To know your final total balance you need to download the whole blockchain.
You could even have zero bitcoin in all your receiving addresses from your backup and still have some bitcoins in the wallet.

First, don't connect the laptop to a network, and put it in airplane mode, you should not connect the laptop to any network ever again.
Then try to find your wallet file (wallet.dat).
If you find it, then make backups in a few new pendrives.
Then if you had a client installed in the laptop, while keeping the laptop with no network, launch the client and look for your balance (which will be outdated), you should have some bitcoins.
You should also look in the application for the list of receiving addresses, then you can check their current balance on another computer at BlockChain website 
So if you still have any bitcoins then those are still in your control, but you could still have the wallet with a password, you can see in the application if the wallet has a password or not. If you do and you don't remember the password, then you are screwed, but if you remember part of it you could still have some home of recovering it with some softwares.
Now if you have any bitcoins and you don't have a password or you remember it, then to transfer any bitcoins (for example for selling) I would recommend you to buy a new computer, (maybe a small Intel NUC), install Linux (such as Debian), and install the Bitcoin-qt software and run it for 1 day or 2 to sync the blockchain.
After the syncing, I close the software, replace the wallet.dat file (under .bitcoin directory) with your original wallet backed-up in pendrives, and then open the software again to see your final balance. Then you can make transactions.
Some variations could include to take your new computer off the network before copying the wallet into it, and then make transactions offline, but that requires some effort and technical skills.

Well, I remember when I started mining a couple of years ago. It was barely profitable if you traded to USD. then the price dropped, and dropped, and dropped for months, even became unprofitable to mine at 2 USD per BTC.

No one predicted these prices and no one knows what is going to happen.

But you have to take in account the new regulations in the last week or so.
If there where no Chinese regulations, I would call it a bubble (though I would wait a little to see if the price stays low).

Mining is done automatically by computers, no human effort is needed besides buying and setting up the computers and checking ounce in a while that every thing is ok.
Mining is the name given to the task of verifying bitcoin transactions that people post in Internet (in the bitcoin p2p network). These transactions say: I am A and I am sending X bitcoins to B. So the verification consists on checking that A has at least X bitcoins.
For this, all miners look at the current blockchain (bitcoin global public ledger, everyone on the bitcoin network has a copy of it). This blockchain is formed by blocks (like pages on the ledger). 
So mining is the task of checking a bunch of published transactions against the ledger and publishing them as the next page of the ledger (the next block).
But the design in bitcoin is such that a new block has to be published in about 10 minutes, and the miner that does this gets to make an emission of 25 bitcoins (this is like a distributed central bank). In order to make it to be 10 minutes and avoid inflation, the algorithm that everyone follows is that to publish a block the miner need to solve a math puzzle, which gets harder to solve if blocks are published in less than 10 minutes. If you don't follow this rule and publish a block, everyone is going to discard it for not following the rule.
To mine Bitcoins (or some other crypto coins), you need hardware.
Currently, mining Bitcoins with a common computer is no longer economically viable, you would be using too much electricity.
Now you need specialized hardware called ASIC, these are commonly electronics peripherals that can be attached by USD to a computer. They are base on customized chips design for bitcoin mining.
With these ASIC Miners connected to your computer, you can use a mining software, like cgminer.
Even with this, mining a block is very hard now, so people join together in a mining pool (a website) to find blocks and share the bitcoins mined. (there is a protocol so people don't cheat). You setup you bitcoin wallet's public address in the pool in order to get payouts.
So you need to buy ASIC Mining Hardware, plug it USB to a computer, sign up in a mining pool. Setup the mining software to connect to the pool. And live it mining nonstop.
There are other crypto coins that use a different mining algorithm (named scrypt) that is currently mined with AMD graphics cards, these card's graphics processing units are very powerful and can do math computing (NVIDIA cards are not very good at mining).
In this case, you can put several AMD graphics card on a PC, install AMD drivers and SDK, and the mining software (such as cgminer).

Processing power is not needed to verify transactions.
It is a part of the design of the bitcoin protocol that is needed to keep block solutions once every 10 minutes.
If it wasn't for this, we would be getting millions of block solutions per hour and emitting 25 bitcoins with each block, creating hyperinflation.
Thus, in order to publish a block, a miner has to solve a math puzzle in which he proves that he is taking in account all the previous published blocks in the blockchain to validate a bunch of new transactions. The math problem is just something that takes 10 minutes worldwide, and it gets harder/easier if it is getting less/more than 10 minutes between publications.
When a miner publishes a valid block, the rest of the miners do a quick check. If it is valid and the math problem resolved was hard enough, they consider this block in the blockchain and they switch to mine the next block. They have to do this, because the majority of the miners will do it. If a miner doesn't he risk getting left behind and wasting time in solving outdated blocks.
The 10 minutes also helps all the miners sync to a new block published.
