Yeah, that whole murder for hire thing, that was just no big deal huh?

That's because they never found bodies, or evidence beyond chat logs.
Not saying it didn't happen, not saying it did. But ulbricht doesn't appear to be an innocent person.

Whoah, I forgot about that. Free dialup. I had a friend that used bluelight free dialup from kmart. It was crap.

Am I too late to the tipping party?

If it doesn't start trading when shares outstanding reaches 2000000, then I stand corrected.
@_date: 2014-05-13 17:49:44
Awesome! Thanks so much

What's wrong with gocoin?
Seems like BTC/LTC integration with business is something we would want?

Keeping in mind how carlos slim made his fortune, you know when something catches on in mexico, big money is made.. Definitely one to keep an eye on.

Not as big a market as mexican nationals working in the us, wanting to securely send funds to their families. Look how much money carlos slim made off telmex.. Selling phone minutes so these same mexican families could keep in touch..

Ah, good point. Decentralization, anonymity, and being able to transfer funds worldwide with the lowest fees inaginable!

It's still just a debit card. The difference is the account it's associated with belongs to the card issuer(visa, master, etc) and not the cardholder. This is so any interest accrued goes to the issuer.

Oregon glassblower here: I also accept btc as my only form of payment online :)
Big ups!

That's possible. But my understanding is that Seedcoin Fund I consists of these 2000000 shares, and the next 2000000 will be offered as Seedcoin Fund II, etc, representing other startups under Seedcoin holdings. Unless you're someone involved worth Seedcoin telling me that in an official context, we'll see. 
Either way, this is the last chance to get in before the next tba future offering.

I could be mistaken but I believe the 8000000 shares to be sold later are to fund a different group of startups.

Maybe western union would be another company to approach about it..

I was unaware of the politics, but that's not surprising

Yeah, we used to have anti-trust laws just for this.

They acted way outside their jurisdiction with mega, and everyone knows it.

All we have to do is wait for the next financial collapse. Imagine if Greece or somebody like that adopted btc..
@_date: 2014-01-10 04:41:51
Sigma has a point though. If you don't plan on converting back to paper, just set a btc price for btc customers - market fluctuations be damned. I blow glass and i'm doing that with any product i sell online and just risking the market fluctuation. So far, so good. If you really believe in btc, it's worth any risk.

Why do the machines need to pay eachother though?

Interesting to think about.

Transferred money from my chase account to my paypal account on thursday. Still waiting.  USA USA USA
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:28:39
I'm in a similar spot.  I transferred some money from my chase account to my paypal account on thursday. The money is no longer in my chase account, but it's not yet arrived in my paypal account.
The money is somewhere.
My theory is paypal holds the funds in their own holding account for a few days to collect interest.
Didn't seem like much, interest on a few days' holding, but when it's millions of transactions a day, that interest adds up quick.
