Bitcoin eliminates the need for the foreign  exchange market which tends to be full of fraud and really messed up stuff. This is where dollars turn into euros but like the hard core version.

I'm so curious, I've done zero research, so normally I wait like 15 mins or so and it's like unconfirmed...and then I'm good after a bit. With this does it get confirmed in secs. Or is this some this new and even wilder than I can imagine.

It's lazy news with a mix of fake. In this articals it's just a summary of the last 1000 articals I've read this month. We should embrace bitcoin getting some sunlight in the mainstream.

How is it possible Japan is last 
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:34:12
U like that one sentence pitch they came with. It's not a currency. They r so misinformed it's insane. Or they are misleading which is so fucked. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:40:14
So this guy this English dude walks up to the queen of England. He says "I just invited this thing called the loom. We can be so much more efficient in production". The queen responds "O no this is horrible it will put to many people out of work in not going to put a royal patent on it." He's like alright whatever and heads to France. France is like fuck England this thing is cool and the French benefited from the increased productivity. 
Japan has basically accepted it. As well as many small island nations across the world. Countries will always compete to be the best and if they don't recognize something has value they miss out. Unless u believe in conspiracies and believe in the new world order that's another subject... 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:02:25
So what a bunch of people are leaving for bch. How much should I not care about this?

I think economy was a bad choice of words. What if you said largest market. Or exchange. Would that work here? 
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:46:29
Wait 30 secs, plug back in, become satoshi
@_date: 2018-04-26 22:56:38
Fuck yea!!  
@_date: 2018-04-17 06:02:11
To me it's a balance. Use it but understand that the 60$ video game is over time it will feel like a 500$+ game. We're still early and it's gonna grow so much. Finally market forces will bring the needed volatility u speak of, simply b/c of the whole scarcity of the 21 million cap. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:54:25
If you do sell, sell to me for cheap
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:15:48
Before bed every night repeat the reason why your are hodling. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:26:29
Agreeded. At the end of the day of ur flowing more money in to crypto than selling it's great for the market cap. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:46:14
Hit me up when you wanna sell some more.
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:55:17
For real though. Dont worry about the price unless you need to sell. You cant take a loss if you dont sell. Think of the dips as a discount day. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:47:50
lol 
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:42:59
