Nothing says the coins were transferred at the time of the seizure (though you would think they would have in case somebody else had a backup of the keys and instructions to move them if things went wrong).  Nor does it say the coins were in a single wallet - or were moved to a single wallet.
So, you are asking for proof that the are a set number of bitcoins from an unknown number of wallets possibly moved to an unknown number of wallets sometime after a particular date.
Sounds easy to prove....................

There is a schedule you can fill out to calculate/report capital gains.  It is not part of the 1040EZ, so you will need to be using one of the more complex tax forms if you do your taxes yourself.  It is the same one you use for reporting stock or commodities.
If you use a tax professional, they will just need your purchase and sale information including fees paid.

It's cheap to list, and if somebody takes them up on it, there is good profit to be made - so long as you don't get hit up for no KYC controls, etc.  I've heard of at least one arrest for that so far - so the risk level is amplified.  So, both reasons contribute to the premium.

It would work for an active, hot wallet.  It may not be such a good choice for a cold wallet.

I agree - when talking about academics, technologists, and other people who have shown that they are more than capable of learning new things.   But, there are several other classes of people that don't have a background to prepare them for something like this.
They aren't usually dumb.  They just see new technology as scary.
I expect that some of them, once they see that it isn't as difficult as they fear, will be happy to use and embrace it.  A bunch of them won't - they just won't be able to get past that fear.
I've taught people like that before.  There are a lot of reasons why they are that way, but it isn't because they want to be.  It isn't because they are anti tech.
To be honest, we have a long way to go before we will be able to get those groups to adopt.  They are the late adopters, not even the mass market.  But, they still outnumber the early adopters by a wide margin.

Good point.  That does give it a lot more flexibility.

The viability of that would depend a lot on how you are using the wallet, but I don't see any reason that wouldn't work with this service.  Let's are just bits, and really, the service is about promising to recover a set of bits and deliver them to the next of kin.
If the bits happen to be the key to a non-multi sig arrangement, it becomes possible to help walk the next of kin through using the key.
Honestly, the service could work as a backup for people who don't trust themselves not to lose their own keys.  However, identity verification is a more difficult task than verifying the authenticity of a death certificate (generally).  So, that is why initially I am thinking of the next of kin scenario.
The smart contact has a difficult  challenge here - it requires an oracle of some sort.  The key holder won't be able to verify the contact condition has been met, and you don't want the other party to verify it either.

It isn't so much as bothered to take it, but more techno-phobic and have trouble changing.
As an example, I have in-laws that were still paying for AOL just a couple of years ago, and that is still their only email address.

Most of the gold farming isn't done domestically, so the IRS would have little success going after the farmers.
Additionally,  the value of WoW gold goes down most of the time, not up - so the amount of profits are much lower.
SEC doesn't care because there aren't public exchanges for WoW gold (no bid/ask books, etc.) They don't see it as a security.
Basically - not enough money there to be worth the effort.

I agree there are ways to do it yourself.
My thought is this would be more likely to be used by people whose next of kin are not interested in crypto - or at least not in learning about how to use the technology.  Just by it's nature, this service would include walking the next of kin through getting the funds in their own wallet (or exchanging for fiat)
