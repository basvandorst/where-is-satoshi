The system's rigged.  
Institutional investors are REQUIRED to purchase the bonds if nobody else does.

LOL... Trump's fault...
Couldn't have been the decades of allowing the banking industry to run amuck, after the repeal of Glass Steagall? Or that China and the Axis powers are promoting the Petro-yaun as an alternative to the petro-dollar?  Or that the federal reserve has printing out the ass for decades and taking junk assets as security?  How about deficit spending and unfunded liabilities?
The US dollar will hyper-inflate like the Zimbabwe dollar, because of a simple concept known as "compound interest".
The reason government spending increases year after year, is that the US has gotten to the point of paying off credit card debt with credit cards.  This isn't a new concept started by the Trump administration.  They have no other choice because of the simple and unavoidable laws of mathematics.  We're approaching the vertical end of the hockey stick, and congress MUST increase spending, or the entire house of cards will collapse.
No Reserve currency lasts forever.
