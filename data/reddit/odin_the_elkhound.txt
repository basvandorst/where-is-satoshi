If you're suggesting using the card to buy a trezor, I already own two.

I don't know how they estimated it, but I've read a couple places say as many as 4 million are lost

Thanks for the insight!

So FDIC insurance is applicable only to legal tender, ie USD. Once you convert your USD to bitcoin, it is no longer FDIC insured. They say they have insurance that covers all assets that are currently liquid, but just be aware that whatever it is is not backed by the full faith of the US gov.

That is interesting and would be a very good reason not to hold there. Looking at their site that looks correct. They claim to have through third parties insurance for greater than the amount that is held liquid in hot wallets at any time, but that is definitely less reliable than FDIC. 
I actually got a Trezor, I have just been slightly paranoid about it malfunctioning or losing it or something, so I havent put my funds in it yet (I only bought in recently and not for a massive amount, but still a lot to me)

I've never had that issue anywhere I've banked, mostly credit unions. I've never had them question me on a charge, they just take it off no questions asked. Usually they catch it before me even

Yeah honestly I've never had a single problem with any of mine. I hear a lot of horror stories from banks and like usually I've had the opposite experience from credit unions. There are so many fewer fees as well, but I think I got an overdraft fee like twice but both times called and talked to them and they took it off

So excuse my ignorance as I'm somewhat new to BTC as well, but Coinbase is FDIC insured right? Are there other wallets that are FDIC insured where you do hold the private keys? Wouldn't it be the act of them holding your funds that enables them to be FDIC insured, as they act like a bank? And if that's the case, wouldn't coinbase be the safest place for them as long as you have less than 250k?
Seems Coinbase is not super popular around here, I'm just generally curious if I'm missing something
