If I enable multi-sig for my ledger wallet will that apply to my 24-word seed backup or would that still be completely vulnerable? 
If not, are there any good ways to secure that 24-word backup? Maybe I'll just laminate it and bury it in a waterproof safe in my yard...

ITT: backpage traffic doubles as thousands of lonely redditors learn they can buy hookers with bitcoin xD

I've got the Duo, each chip stored separately, stored overlapping and split segments of the seed in separate locations. I'm taking security seriously. **However**, when formatting the second ledger I had to type the seed into my computer. I use quality AV but I've been hearing that there are so many keyloggers out there that even the best AV is not perfect. Then I heard on 'Let's Talk Bitcoin' that the trezor scrambles the seed inputs when you're typing it in, and they also ask for random words that aren't part of your seed. Ledger just asked for them unadulterated and in perfect order. That is a **major security flaw**. So now I'm sitting here concerned that my ledger is useless, wishing multisig applied directly to the seed. 
I love the ledger but I don't like having a glaring hole in the security. Maybe somebody can offer a solution or tell me why I'm exaggerating the risk. My reputable, paid AV showed a clean scan before and after creating the seed but I'm still paranoid that there's a hidden keylogger.

I would like greater freedom in the adjustments. The lowest it would let me go yesterday was 0.0005 and it confirmed the next block, I didn't care even if it took 6 hours. What happened was: I had it set to the lowest fee/slowest setting and it said "0.00053783 is an abnormally high fee, would you like to send for 0.0005?" No option to go lower. 
I do think it's really cool that they implemented that, but perhaps some more user freedom would be appreciated.

Does multisig protect the 24-word seed?

Nice. Found it: 
I'm resetting the chips with a new seed right now. Thanks.

Thankfully I've got a paper backup of the blockchain in cold storage.

It says the computer will not be connected to the internet during or *after* the initialization process. I can still do this on my laptop though, correct? Just run the USB OS with my laptop offline, initialize the Ledger, then remove the USB and carry on...?

'Analysts' 'cited'. 
If economists, analysts, politicians etc. believe that trust is an issue for bitcoin, when it is perhaps its largest and most revolutionary strength, that is shameful. 
If the analysts are saying that the public doesn't trust it, I agree, because people know nothing about it, and therefore do not trust it. Of all the people that can recall ever hearing the word 'bitcoin', ~80% of them will say; 'Ya didn't a lot of people lose money with that?', or, 'The price shot up a lot then crashed.' 
I think what will happen is as bitcoin is integrated further into society, the idea of a decentralized ledger will gradually be known and correlated to bitcoin and trust. People don't know technically how the internet transmits data or where it's stored, but they know that one hacker or government can't shut it down, and they can access it everywhere in civilization. 
In summary: **If public trust is our biggest issue, we're golden because time will overcome that problem.**
