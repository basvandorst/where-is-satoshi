Is this a test to see how far one can go and get the bitcoin community to hand it to them? Someone on here earlier this week asks "where can I get $5 worth of Bitcoin" and a community member sends it to them...
Is this the new not-so-hidden form of begging?
Can we add something on the sidebar for the legit questions of this nature (and forgive me if you are legit... I am just seeing a pattern here)?

2. You can't spam bitcoin
3. You don't know if it is spam because maybe someone really wants to send super small amounts of btc back and forth to the same wallets like some fucking crypto ping pong game and since the protocol allows it, it can't be spam
4. It's not an attack even though it happens at very specific and opportune times in which a full mempool would be a serious pain in the ass

I think you are looking at it in a slightly different manner. At one time I thought I'd like to try forex trading. I read a shit ton, practiced, etc. Then I put $500 into the market. I lost it all, not so much in one dumb move, but over a while making small but representative trades (e.g. % of my total investment). It was a cheap lesson, for me, that I did not actually know enough to be the trader I thought I was. You take $50 and fuck up... no big deal. Hopefully though you learn something. You do really well (say 3x $$) - now you have a clue. Take that money and blow it - oh shit, you got lucky that first time etc.

I disagree. It ain't about the feels man, its about the realz - Roger really is a scumbag who has done a lot of provably shady shit. Jihan is a scumbag who has done some provably shady shit. The fact that two scumbags are the BCH standard bearers and have undue influence over Bitcoin Cash is a massive red flag.
Is bitcoin perfect? Nope. Is it getting better? Yep. As for the doom and gloom - you have no clue whether it is real or not as a critical mass is not using BCH right now to show that gloom manifest. It's too early to discount that.

This reminds me when Wolong (I think he was a Chinese guy with some money) briefly influenced the price of Doge significantly a few times. He was so proud of himself he'd brag on IRC and then pump the price. This was during one of the shitcoin creation frenzies where so many copies of so many coins were flooding the market. Suddenly he starts talking about a Wolong Coin and several people went and launched their own Wolong coin - there were at least 3 of them, so nobody knew WTF was going on and his vanitycoin died a firey death.

Wrong. They have an "idea" that is dogshit, and they are using their power to influence a lot of ignorant individuals along with strong influence over mining (Antbleed, mining empty blocks, etc.) and creating confusion and dishonest narratives with propaganda (sockpuppets, twitter shilling, name dilution). 
Ver is a con man - look at who he hangs out with, and his Mt. Gox video. Bitcoin Cash is his baby (try to tell him otherwise) which is extremely fucking weird. Jihan is another story with similar weirdness.

Yes, my course of action would have been to "just hold", because when I invest in something it's not a roulette wheel where I expect instant action, and if I were to invest in BTC for the first time 3 weeks ago, I would look at the volatility and say "hmm... wow... a volatile asset that has fluctuated to -30% multiple times *this year* and may very well do that again, but because I think it is a good vehicle for investment, I'll put my money into it."
Your goofing around with alts worked out for you, but if you stick around here you can read about the 1,000 other dummies that tried to do the same thing as you and ended up worse off. Especially when BTC goes up suddenly and you are dicking around with Derpcoin trying to grind out a few %.

When I worked for a major search engine company many years ago, any time a developer said something was "trivial" (ergo "I'm not going to fix that massively shit thing that is fucking our nontechnical users right now") it really meant they had no clue how to fix it.

Maybe not so bad as lemmings, but I would argue that we seek authority for a few reasons, one of which is to help us know *what to do without having to put too much thought into it.* The lemming idea is that they will do anything, including running off a cliff to their deaths, and that's a bit too extreme. In many ways, however, we don't have strong opinions about a majority of things, and the mental energy it takes to come to a scholarly opinion on anything is less appealing than just finding a good source to copy. Add to that a sense of security/protection (this is why keeping boogeymen alive is a key to control) and you have a pretty good formula for behavior, with enough mental energy left over to nuke some Hot Pockets and binge watch Stranger Things after a day at the salt mines.

It's a totally new cutting edge coin that is also a trading card. It uses solar power generated in Saudi Arabia (SHEIKS bro, ever heard of em?) and converts it cryptographically into a unique "solar hash" (whitepaper forthcoming) that is stored on the SunChain - a better, faster, cheaper, and more bacon-flavored blockchain. The beauty of the SunChain is that it only works while the sun is out, thereby saving over 50% of the power used, especially in winter. It, um, also does some cool technical stuff that you wouldn't understand but I can show you some weird math to convince you. 
It launches on the Dogenex platform next week, but we can get you in on the pre-ICO if you join our Slack channel.

That's like saying "this Apple stock keeps going up... should I invest in some other tech stock instead in case it acts like Apple?"
1. It's not too late. Very few people know about bitcoin in any real way, and even fewer own any
2. Bitcoin gets first mover advantage, and has a very healthy ecosystem to secure it
3. Bitcoin has been around for several years and has not been hacked, broken, etc.
My take is that if you are in it for the long haul (3+ years at least), diversify, but go heavy on bitcoin. Ether and Litecoin are the only others I know enough about to say they might be viable. Maybe Iota if it gets traction.

1. A correction: it got pumped to $9500 after trading for, I believe 2 minutes. 
2. You are correct that there was not significant trading at that price - the market was so thin, the price was jumping hundreds of dollars per trade, and many of these trades were for .005 BCH.
3. They said they would support it in January so 99.999% of people were surprised to hear it started trading (shady).
4. I believe this was on purpose, to get a lot of free publicity and to list BCH as a coin that traded for $9500, giving it an inflated valuation. Look at the prices from the first day - up in the $4000+ range.

depends on the price of bitcoin at/ before expiry. LedgerX sells single bitcoin contacts (not lots of 100 like most options contracts). The article says the price was $3600 per contract and they bought 275 of these. So this person has the "right" to buy up to 275 bitcoin at 50k. They won't make money until it's worth 53,600 because of the contract price, but every dollar after that is profit x 275. If it hits close to 50k earlier, they might want to sell the contracts to someone else for a premium. Basically, this person thinks bitcoin has a decent chance of rising quite a bit next year.

I agree. As someone following bitcoin for 3 years now, I was ahead of the media curve for the most part. I have talked to tech nerds, my dad (a car mechanic) and a variety of others about bitcoin. The response has been mixed (never hostile, except for the pseudo-survivalist, knife sharpener in my neighborhood who argued that anything besides "cold hard cash" was bullshit). Most people see it as:
* related to drugs
* a complex technology (digital money? what is that? who owns it? can it get hacked? could someone online steal mine?)
* volatile in price, and has lost value over time
* maybe related to gangs, illegal gambling, and money laundering
* more novel than useful
* something to let other braver souls mess with for the time being

Run a chi-square test. What is the % of true hashrate this pool has commanded over the timeframe? How many total blocks were found by the pool in this timeframe? Compare that against the distribution where they got exactly x% of blocks discovered by all parties in that timeframe.

Some sidechain oriented questions:
1. If I immobilize (e.g. send) exactly 1 full BTC to sidechain "AwesomeSauce" and "pay" someone there .5 AwesomeCoin, and that person wants to switch that into BTC, I assume this is possible, and that they will have access to only half of my previously immobilized BTC. The description makes it seem like it is not, based on the coins being described as having a specific "coin-ness" (ergo colored coin possibilities).
2. What happens if a side chain dies (say it is mined by 1 company and that company dies in a fire). Are the BTC that were transferred into it perma-locked? Seems like yes. 
3. If a bad actor makes a "SneakAlley" sidechain, could they trick unsuspecting folks into using it and then pull a Neo &amp; Bee and take off with the coins? 
4. Could a bad actor change the rules of a sidechain after creating it (perhaps based on how it was set up), tricking the n00bs into thinking they were playing in a friendly place but then getting fully screwed?

Not to be a jerk, but sometimes it's important to do your OWN research instead of relying on the interpretation of a difficult topic by someone else (they could get it wrong, or gloss over parts you might find important).

From a few months back:
[World Bank Report: Bitcoin is Not a Ponzi Scheme]( 
NEW YORK (InsideBitcoins) — Bitcoin may be a demand-driven “bubble,” but it is no Ponzi scheme, says Kaushik Basu, World Bank chief economist and author of ‘Ponzis: The Science and Mystique of a Class of Financial Frauds.’
“Contrary to a widely-held opinion, Bitcoin is not a deliberate Ponzi. And there is little to learn by treating it as such,” Basu writes in the recently released report.
However, Basu says the cryptocurrency has been the subject of broad market speculation.
“One can buy Bitcoin the way one can buy euros and trade freely with others having euros. Trouble started when people began speculating that the value of Bitcoin would rise, thereby raising the demand for Bitcoin and making the value-rise a self-fulfilling prophesy. In other words, what we witnessed recently in the Bitcoin phenomenon fits the standard definition of a speculative bubble,” Basu says.
Basu served as chief economic adviser to the government of India and is currently on leave from Cornell University where he is professor of economics and international studies.
“The main value of Bitcoin may, in retrospect, turn out to be the lessons it offers to central banks on the prospects of electronic currency, and on how to enhance efficiency and cut transactions cost,” Basu concludes.

The government wants to get as much $$$ as possible from the auctioning of (legal) assets. Period. Crashing the price and making goofball arbitragers a shit ton of money does not help them. The cash is more important than the price fucking.
I don't think the gov is really all that concerned about BTC right now (whether or not they should be). For one thing, the amount of venture capital being pumped into the technology should make them think about how to make money off of this tech rather than suppress it. Not to say that some of the conspiracy fiends on don't stay up masturbating to inflated ideas about persecution...

I agree to some extent, but would argue that the media and public don't get it to begin with (so this further distraction is a momentary blip of noise in an otherwise confusing landscape anyway). I think it was on MSNBC they were talking about cryptos and the expert lady said "there are a number of cryptos beyond BTC like BBQ coin, SEX coin, Ron Paul Coin..." and the anchor goes "wait wait wait SEX COIN? Let's hear about that!!!!!! hahahahah!!!! yeah!"
It basically destroyed any opportunity to learn anything about the cryptos and became the 2 minute "cat in a well" distraction from whatever political news was going on that day.
With crypto being confusing enough, and altcoins on top of it, the general consumer has a lot to "WTF" about right now. It will take some time, and Dogecoin may be the fun, nonthreatening,approachable way lots of youth get there and then teach the wrinklies what's up.

Wasn't he nailed more for operating an unlicensed money transmission service (thereby, in the eyes of the court, skirting the "know your customer" laws)?
Additionally, if tumbling is laundering, meaning "obfuscating" rather than "hiding the source of illegal gains", I don't believe that is illegal at all. I could go to a bank, buy 100 $1, walk to another bank, trade it for 20 $5, then go to a third bank and trade for 100 $1, effectively "laundering" my money. I doubt that behavior is illegal.

I saw it mentioned when investigating the Silk Road, darknet, and some internet gambling forums and made a mental note to "look further later" (Oct 2012).
I read about the rise of Bitcoin and watched in real time one of the crash/recoveries (Oct 2013).
I began reading and investigating more. Should I get some? Will it be illegal? Was now a good time? What is Bitcoin's "true value"? (Early Dec 2013).
I had the lightbulb moment when I realized that even if its only use was in the deep underground economy, that was still enough to make it extremely valuable. I bought in (~$800). (Mid Dec. 2013).
I didn't think Wall Street would be so keen on it so fast, or that senators would be discussing it. Exciting times.

Now sure, info can get faked etc. but that would require several people involved in shenanigans and as such I guessed (can be wrong) while the buyer may not be officially revealed, the actual price paid seems like it should absolutely be public.

I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that most burglaries are for grabbing shit that can be flipped as quickly as possible. Holding goods, listing them online, waiting for payment (or the promise thereof) and then sending the goods and waiting for escrow to release the $$ makes it highly unlikely that a majority of stolen shit show up on Open Bazaar. 
It just doesn't get the burglar what he/she needs fast enough.

Totally agree about the off market bit. Another potential "value" of bidding high is getting a ton of advertising out of the win. Interviews, press, etc. (I'm thinking Coinbase and others who will be bidding). You could price the advertising value into your bid on top of the street value.

A number of reasons (I had this argument with a friend who used to work for investment bankers, so we have a friendly bet going on this. He says -3%, I say +10% over market price).
1. Getting 3,000 BTC in one swoop at a known, stable price is very hard. This "difficulty" is worth a premium.
2. Competitive bidding will create a scenario where underbidding the current market price makes 0 sense (= automatic fail). This is my opinion.
3. The premium will be paid because the future of bitcoin looks rosy, not the past. A 5% premium today is a joke if the estimated value of the asset is more in the future.

Here's a try...maybe not perfect, but good enough for nontechies?
A bank has several tellers and you want to deposit a check. An evil jerk in line at the bank takes a copy of your check as you wait in line to give it to teller 1, changes the name, prints that copy, and tries to get it to teller 2 before you. He gets a receipt with a unique ID on it when he deposits the check (and so do you). Later, the evil jerk calls the bank and says "my deposited check didn't clear" and reads the unique ID from the receipt, and because the bank is dumb and doesn't use the bank account numbers to verify, but rather runs its business by receipt IDs, they see that the ID exists and the credit never went through and so they credit the jerk with the money in the amount of the check. The bank has just taken one check (yours) and paid out the amount twice (once to you, once to the jerk) without realizing it.

The twofold shame in this particular interview is that he rarely answers Max's questions (very politician-like, e.g. speaking points only) and the statements he makes are as you suggest, freeform multi-subject rants that, if written as an article, would require twice as many footnotes as words in the main body.

It's not about the meme, it's about the community and the services, and the sense of fun and seriousness mixed. It's the "cute" coin, the 'fun" coin and, as someone else said - the coin of youth. Bitcoin is grandpa - very important and the basis for the cryptofamily, but Dogecoin is accessible and has a "me too" aspect of sharing with friends. People are mining DOGE on their smartphones so they can be a part of the crew. That is powerful - and the beauty is that the political and disruptive nature of cryptos is probably, for most of those folks, totally lost and THAT'S OK! They are the whisperers, the promoters, and the ones that will spread the news of the new economy to a mass audience. Hate the meme? That's your right... but hate the movement? That's your loss.

Can you create a sidechain that utilizes the bitcoin network for mining?

With closed bids, you have to try and "out think" your opponents. You get one chance to submit the highest bid or you lose... so how much is everyone else underbidding? The likelihood is that though some may try to get coins on the cheap, others will definitely bid *at least market price*. This is due in part to low liquidity in the market - buying lots of coins at once will raise the price significantly because there are not that many coins within, say $25 of the current bid price. 
So there is an opportunity to pay some relative premium and get a ton of coins, off market, without changing the general supply/demand (assuming they don't autodump, which would be stupid). Any intelligent bidder will realize this and use a variety of methods for calculating the price they are willing to pay to "win" the bid. This means outmaneuvering the others which probably = bidding x% higher than the current price, where x = a little bit beyond what a rational actor would pay (to ensure a winning bid). When everyone uses a similar strategy... things get weird.
Popcorn time...

Interesting notes:
1. (Page 2) They fail to call out the benefit of frictionless, near instant money transfer as a benefit to consumers. Is this an oversight, or because they don't think that stupid shit like waiting 3 days for money to "settle" in an account is a consumer issue or...?
2. (Page 6) The statement "A pro-innovation approach that balances innovation with regulatory requirements (anti-fraud, AML, Cyber Security and Privacy &amp; Information Security) is attractive." is laughable. That is decidedly NOT a pro- innovation friendly or balanced approach. Particularly because in the same paragraph they call out the need for both international and national regulation. 
3. (Page 6) "Regulation can grant legitimacy" - while not a completely batshit statement, it's pretty easy to laugh at this one. 
4. (Page 6) They do recognize that "If its usefulness is negated by overtly strict regulation it is unlikely that it will be used or driven underground."
5. (Page 11) "The EBA and a number of countries worldwide such as Brazil, Argentina, and India have issued warnings to the public about the risks associated with digital currencies." Trying to legitimize the risks by evoking warnings of these governments is hardly confidence inspiring considering their current state. 
6. (Page 13) They call out that a lot of the problems with digital currencies (money laundering, etc.) exist for physical currencies as well.
7. (Page 15) They argue (in passing) that regulation is needed for an honest system. 
8. (Page 16) The risks to monetary and financial stability are a bit desperate sounding, but the list is worth looking at to understand what could be at stake if/when crypto blows the fuck up.
For the most part, the paper appears honest and well thought out. There are some inherent biases (regulation is needed for honesty... Can someone make me a "Condescending Wonka" .jpg about a bank making this claim in lieu of today's news about the currency manipulation fines?) but all in all a decent read - especially to understand what the outsider, entrenched folks are thinking/asking/etc.
TL;DR: RTFM, it's worth it.

I disagree that it is better to test this type of case on a test network. First off, the test seems simple to run IRL (why complicate it)? Second, a test network can only get you so far because it doesn't simulate the real world (only as good as your ability to model reality, something that is nontrivial). OP's approach is one step closer to what the "real world" outcome would be.
Please don't assume that I think 20MB testing isn't important because I argue that OP's test is important. Also, this isn't exactly a zero sum test opportunity (though time cycles are finite). There is no way to test the 20MB in real life, but there is a way to test the effects of a full 1MB block (potential) issue in reality. In some ways I'd argue OP's test is MORE important since it shows what exactly happens right this second in the real implementation, not what might happen in a pseudoreal testbed with a 20MB limit. Simulating reality is HARD, and OP's artificial but damn close to real test is worth a lot.

Your argument makes no sense in context. "People think she is a shrill for the altcoin Dash"... used exactly as a person would use the term "shill" (what the actual fuck is a "shrill for the altcoin Dash" ???) The word "shill" makes **perfect sense** in context, while "shrill" does not.
So, you can disagree with me, but I think maybe you fucked up and are one of those people who just can't admit they made a mistake. I was trying to help you not make that mistake in the future, but whatever.

TBH my first interest in bitcoin was to set up a miner and try that aspect of it... read up on it a bit, and since BTC was ~$11.50 at the time everyone was talking about how mining didn't make sense from a cost/benefit POV. Since I only cared at that point about the mining aspect, I ignored it for a year, was reintroduced to its utility when reading about SilkRoad and had an a-ha moment as I began to understand the political aspects. So I bought my first coins at ~$850 or so...

You can buy thru localbitcoins or thru a bitcoin ATM. If you use any traditional system to try and buy BTC it requires you to get your shit together well in advance - just like buying stocks for the first time (ACH 3 days to settle etc.)
If you "wanted to buy during the dip" this means you knew a dip was possible which suggests you didn't just find out about bitcoin. I know you know this now, but you should have set up all your funding ahead of time. Bankers gonna bank.

Hold up... "people don't realize how articulate software developers are" is just about the opposite of "non-technical people...don't have the capacity to understand..." + "if you are unable to speak the language of a trade/craft (then its yr fault and go do something else)"
If you are "articulate" then you are able to know your audience and speak to them in a way they understand. This is why engineering manuals (and many programming guides) are absolute dogshit - they are written by engineers who are writing for people who already know what they are doing, thereby being good for reference but bollocks for those trying to learn. 
A majority of my career has been made from *translating* dev speak to business speak to data scientist/researcher speak - I've worked with countless devs on dozens of projects that included presentations, manuals or other deliverables. It does not come naturally for a majority of the devs that I have worked with.

In many ways, yes exactly. The volatility in the specific asset changes the price that the seller of the contract is willing to sell for. Imagine it is a contract for rocks. A ton of rocks cost $10 most of the time, but sometimes cost 10.05 or 9.95. If I am a rocks future seller I might sell you a contract for "1 lot of a ton of $10 December Rocks (expires on Dec 15)" for .02 - here I am promising you I will sell you a ton of rocks for $10, but you pay me .02 right now for that right (and I keep that .02 no matter what). If rocks in mid December cost $10.05 then you get a discount (pay me $10 and you paid me .02 before, and I have to get you those rocks somehow) but if rocks only cost 9.99 it's cheaper for you to lose the contract (let it expire) and buy them in the open market. It costs you 10.01 in the end because you gave me .02 and costs you 9.99. Most people don't actually take delivery of the asset (you don't actually WANT the rocks, just to bet on the spread), so they are "cash settled" which means you either get the difference in the contract from me paid in cash or the contract expires worthless. In my example above, Rocks cost $10.05 and you have a $10 contract so you would get .05 at expiry, for a profit of .03.
Now... think about a volatile asset like bitcoin... how much should I sell you a 1 bitcoin $10,000 contract to expire December 15? Should I charge you $2000 for that right? $1500? The volatility means it's quite a risk for both parties. But fuckers love to gamble for the lambo-sized wins so there will be a market.
Can't wait to see the premiums on these contracts. By the way, futures are a bit more complicated than I let on because you can sell someone else your contract before it expires, but that's a different lesson for a different day.

In fact, if you read up on the origin of futures (onion futures were first on the CBOT) it was so farmers could lock in a price for crops ahead of time by getting someone else to shoulder the risk, for a fee. A simpler example for today is gas futures - companies that rely on stable gas prices (Fed-Ex, UPS) buy futures to ensure that fluctuations upwards in the price of gas are offset for them by the contracts they hold. It costs them capital up front (when they buy the future) and it may expire worthless (like your insurance policy if you make no claim) but if they do need it, they are covered - just like insurance.

Creating a market that does not rely on walking down the street (both Johns and escorts) and interacting with pimps etc. It functions as a screening process for both parties, and has the potential to remove the additional criminal elements (beyond prostitution) that usually work together in a traditional sex-trade environment.

Super Generic ELI5 (aka any finance neckbeards out there - don't crucify me for my generalizations):A "futures contract" is an agreement between you (buyer) and person X (seller) that up to a certain point in time you have the right to buy something at a specific price on a defined end date. 
First, you pay for the contract. It's like saying "hey dude, I'll give you $20 today for the right for me to buy 5 bitcoin @ $7000 each on December 21, 2017" or someone telling you "hey man, for $20 I will sell you 5 bitcoin @ $7000 each on December 21, 2017"
If you agree to that price, you give the seller $20. That money is gone, but you have a ticket you can redeem or sell to someone else through December 21. If bitcoin never hits $7004 or more (your break-even point) you let the ticket (futures contract) expire because it doesn't make sense to cash it in. But if bitcoin does go up higher (or it seems like it will) before expiry... now you have some options.
You can sell your futures contract in the open market - it has a value based on some complex math + magic guessing. So maybe bitcoin is at $7100 on Nov 15... you are holding a ticket for cheap bitcoin - you could sell it to someone else who is willing to take on the risk that bitcoin might fall below $7000 + 1/5 of what they pay for it. Or you hodl the contract until the day it expires and is "settled".
On the settlement day, if it is a "cash settled" future, the ticket gets turned in (if it is worth anything) and the seller has to cover the cost of the difference between the market price and the futures price you agreed to. So if bitcoin was worth $7200 on expiry, the seller would owe whomever had the ticket (contract) $200 per unit * 5 units = $1000. You paid $20, you get paid $1000, profit: $980. If bitcoin was worth $6900 on expiry...the ticket gets thrown away. You lose $20 (unless you sold your contract to someone else in between buying/expiry). 
The rules are different for "delivery settled" futures contracts, but that's a lesson for another day.

Assuming you invest the same amount per trade, that is what I am asking. But I understand your answer now. As a note, you might want to figure that figure out, especially if you increase your unit of investment, both as a way to know "+$5000 = avg(1.005) return" and where you start to hit a market liquidity issue (if +100% money per investment unit only yields +60% profit). Also, if you make a new bot, so you can compare appropriately to see if it is actually better or not.

This may also be why Ver tries to push the narrative of "Core" vs "BCH"... as though there are two cryptoteams lined up on the 50 yard line...
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:53:56
My hypothesis was that they fucked up the market on purpose by having that 5 minutes of trading, causing news outlets to pick it up, advertising BCH and stirring up demand and excitement while also establishing an artificial and incredibly high price right out of the gate ($4k) and then, when they opened the BCH market the next day at noon it had an artificially high opening price on Coinbase. The smart money dumped ASAP and while there was a little wave down and up again, it's only atrophied from there. My guess is that they hoped the 4k base would serve as a jumping off point and it would go up from there, reach parity with BTC, and then go beyond and become "the true bitcoin". This would be a lot harder @ $350 when BTC was ~$20k. It didn't work.

Not related to bitcoin in any way, but this is just a load of dogshit doublespeak:
When asked whether an explosion in billionaire wealth had caused the super-rich to become increasingly disconnected from the rest of society, Stadler replied, "I think it is quite the opposite if you look at the facts… And we were surprised by those facts."






So... altruism is selfishly giving of resources, not employing people (and note he said "direct and indirect employment" - WTF is indirect employment, all the people who benefit from the employee spending?) Furthermore, the "value added" by tech disruption has nothing to do with altruism either. So basically the "facts" are that rich people spend some of their money on their businesses. THAT'S NOT ALTRUISM SHITHEAD. More "job creator" bullshit.

To them it sounds like super weird, hella sketchball techno-nonsense that could actually blow up completely tomorrow and as such, they won't promote it. 
There was a time when bitcoin fanatics were running around in there yelling "hurrr durrrr buy BTC you plebian fiat-slaves, obvs!" and after enough of that shit, they seem to have taken a "promote BTC = NOPE" stance. So thank your local hyperspastic BTC neckbeard for ruining the opportunity. I have, BTW seen discussions of crypto in there so everything BTC is not banned.

I think this is a big deal and good for bitcoin, but maybe not in the ways most folks are thinking... hear me out, and I don't know a lot more than the basics about these markets...
While some people think (falsely) that this is good for bitcoin because of the liquidity issue - that is, if institutions have to hodl coins in order to make these markets (they don't) then the price will go up due to a smaller float. As I mentioned, I don't think any such requirement exists as there is the cash settlement piece (you don't take delivery of the asset on expiry).
The "good for bitcoin" part is that it furth NORMALIZES bitcoin as an asset to invest in. It's a further validation of bitcoin as something worth something and functions as an advertisement for bitcoin to the broader world. That's why I think it is good - the further "mainstreaming" of cryptocurrency as a legitimate, legal, acceptable, not just for drugs and not a ponzi asset.

The target audience is the crypton00b, the person who heard about this bitcoin thing on the news or read about it in the paper and now wants to get in on the action. This is where the marketing machine potentially gently but consistently guides him in the wrong direction.
This is how Ver gets invited to talk on MSM. This is how the coffee house conversation with some quick phone research to bitcoin.com gets cemented in someone's head. Over and over (oh Ver).
The branding move is a long con - and meant for those just a tiny bit more savvy or late to the game than Bitconeeeeeeeeeeeect-ers. Don't be fooled. Remember - this isn't about convincing or tricking us, it's about the 99% who will be coming into crypto over the next 3 years.

I just read the article and the paper. I also read the comments in this thread so far. I have a background in statistics, machine learning, etc. so wanted to say a few things:
1. The article is very vague about what they are actually predicting, and that is important. If you look at the actual paper it is data from Dec 2013 - Sept 2016 and they are trying to find and use specific topics from the last 12 days to predict the value and transaction volume of between 1 and 12 days into the future.
2. They used Bitcointalk for text, CoinDesk for Prices + transactions, Daily Google Trends for Bitcoin, and Daily Wikipedia Usage for Bitcoin.
3. (FTA) The
= 80.39%)
is based
= 81.37%)
is based
4. The terms related to "China" was the one significant predictor of price. Terms related to "Blockchain", "Altcoin", and "transaction" were significant predictors of transaction volume.
5. 80% accuracy does not mean that "yelling $1M guyz!" = a result of only $800k it means they have a model that is incorrect (though I didn't dig into how they determine "correctness" or "accuracy") 20% of the time. Think of it like a coin flip where 80% of the time they call it correctly.
6. Trying to influence the price by gaming the model will just reduce the accuracy of the model over time. Similar to how you used to be able to spam a Yahoo finance subscriber email list with CAP LETTERS and EX!CLAM!AT!ION!!!!! points and pump your penny stock... it stopped working once the pattern was recognized and exploited.

Abstract the message from bitcoin, from everything concrete down to its core and it reads: There are things that could be secret, and that is a problem for us (me).
It is definitely concerning when we have people in power who think that this type of statement is true, or that part of their mandate is to have access to whatever they want regardless of the laws, constitution, etc.

I just set up a node a few weeks ago and it took me a while as well. All the guides I found, including the one on bitcoin.org for running a full node (not BIP148), did not work out of the box ***&lt;edit&gt; b/c I was on Ubuntu 17.x not 16***. 
Your above code, if accurate, is the first succinct set of commands I have seen for setting up the BIP148. Otherwise you have to know exactly what you are doing or derp around online for hours. I'm a linux n00b (and I assume there are lots of me) so, yeah, it's not a 5 minute job for us.

Disagree. The computer literate will have a leg-up in certain cases, like they do today (online brokerages, travel without an agent, etc.) but the lack of universal literacy represents an inefficiency in the market that others can take advantage of and monetize by creating simple and safe services that make it so you don't have to understand the computer.
I work in tech, and have heard for years engineers grouse about how people need to be "more like them" in order for things to work. This is wrong. You are (usually) not your customer. Time is zero-sum and there are a number of people who see technology as a shortcut from A to B and expect it to function as such with little to no ramp up. If it is too difficult, it will fail.
Simple, stupid example: I worked for MSFT Search 10 years ago. The Local Search team put out a UX that had 2 search boxes "what" do you want and "where" do you want to search for it (e.g. "plumber", "Chicago"). 95% of people didn't get it. It was very simple, and pre-slugged with the expected context. The team expected a bit of confusion but not the massive fail they saw (most of the time people either put the compound query in the "what" search box, or they typed the same thing into both boxes.) My point is not "OMG people are so dumb, they just needed to get more computer literate about this very simple 2 field search system" but rather - if something as simple as a two box search that is preslugged with a grey text example blows people's minds because they are used to a single search box, making the statement about people having to be more skilled with computers just to be able to compete is not true. 
It represents opportunity, which is why tech geeks are overpaid weirdos. But to forget that our customers are generally unsavvy and to expect them to just smarten up is a grave mistake.

I would add that this is what makes bitcoin a truly disruptive technology - it takes what was "the way we do things" and completely removes the entrenched inefficiencies (time, permission, manipulation), creating a system that if proven to be stable (e.g. no major bugs that blow it up) supplants the old. Letters, meet email. Hand calculator, meet computer. Newspapers, meet internet blogs. Classifieds, meet Craigslist.  etc.
I don't tend to take the hardcore conspiracy theorist "enslavement" schtick too seriously. I think a lot of people saw a lot of opportunities to make a lot of money by bending the system, and they did. Now they are very powerful - on that playground. This happened very organically, very naturally. This disruptive system just blows that up very neatly.
@_date: 2017-07-08 18:56:08
Ok... so now I need to run apt-get install and then the bitcoin build is replaced and running bitcoind will run the BIP148 version?

I think it is along the lines of "the money isn't in gambling, it's in providing gambling services"
I'm drawing the parallel not because I think of the technology as gambling (though there is huge risk) but that the moneybags are investing in things that facilitate bitcoin, not in the commodity itself. This is, in their minds, a much better and more viable option for a good outcome.

I believe you are saying correlation is not causation.
