Could be an issue with the node ledger connects to.  I have had this happen occasionally.  All you need to know is that it is there.  Your ledger is just a signing device, nothing more.  I have had this happen a few times and eventually it shows up.  No worries, you are good to go.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:58:21
Not sure, maybe try uninstalling the ledger app and reinstalling.  If that doesn't work throw your computer out the window and buy a new one.

Could be something with chrome?  Kill your chrome process, maybe try a reboot.

I currently use balances.io for this and yours is way better.  I love that I don't have to download some stupid app to use it.  
My only negative feedback is to allow the option to register and save.  You are saving all my addresses in local storage.  Not a big deal unless someone steals my laptop.  A quick look through my history and a peek under the hood and they can find all my ~~addresses~~ in local storage and can then target me for a coin theft.
Before I get preached to by the reddit police, yes I know you could potentially  use my email address, username and my password to try and target me to steal my coins if you allow me the option to create an account.   However, I find the idea of accessing your site over vpn, in a private browser session, with some random username and a random password to be much safer.  Someone steals my laptop and there is no trace of bitcoin.  No coindetail.com history, no coindetail.com local storage.  And if you want to try and use my registration info to coordinate an attack good luck, you will be working with something like this:

Timeline doesn't really add up.  I'm guessing a wallet with 66,000 btc in it is going to be monitored.  If it belonged to btc-e and it was stolen I'm guessing they would have known about it within minutes and shit would have been unplugged and btc-e offline by 7:05.  But who really knows.

Relative to the time it can take to get verified with MtGox and other exchanges, yes.

If you are going to be actively trading be sure to figure out how your client handles "change."   Change is what it sounds like, say you decide to sell 1BTC of 5BTC it's possible that the transaction will require more than 1BTC from your wallet to process the transaction.  It's possible that 5BTC goes out and then 4BTC comes back to you as change.  Some clients will create a new random address to store this change to help anonymize your money trail.  You will need to make a new backup of your keys/wallet to secure your wallet after this transaction.   I use MultiBit which will return your change to the first address in your wallet rather than creating a new address.

If the feds are coming for your coins you have much bigger problems.  If you have coins that are in any way accessible to you and the feds know about them they will get them.

One question, did you have two factor authentication on?  Second question, how did you come up with your 90% figure exactly?  You are your own bank, if you didn't have two factor authentication enabled then it is very likely that your account was compromised due to your lack of security.  MtGox isn't going to trash their reputation to steal .5 btc.

Post the public address so we can see the public activity of the address and the movement of your claimed 942 bitcoins.  Otherwise you are lying.

I don't live in the US at the moment.  However I have checks for my US bank account.  I mail them to campbx from here, it isn't super fast but it is better than nothing.

I originally did it this way, but now my wallet has many addresses and many labels that I want to preserve.  Backing up the keys doesn't preserve the labels.  Also, if you are actively spending your bitcoin I think you should be backing up the wallet file.  The idea of my btc client creating a new address to assign my change to terrifies me.  I feel better running from a truecrypt volume and pushing it back up to the cloud after any payment I send.

It seems to me that if they had the password they would have moved the funds to a new secure address.  Who is to say that more than one person doesn't have the private key for DPRs funds?  What is to keep him from communicating the private key right now to his lawyer and having them moved?  How do we know he doesn't have a dead mans trigger set up on a remote server to communicate his private key to a loved one at some point in the future?  I think it's safe to say the FBI doesn't have his private key.

Typically I export and backup import keys for my wallet before I ever send any btc to them. So, if during a transaction the client creates a new address to store my change and then my hard drive crashes before I get a chance to create an updated export am I screwed?    Or do my original import keys have some way of accessing change at this newly created change address?
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:30:04
I think I understand the concept of receiving change however I don't understand why 5 bitcoins would be prevented from being spent on a few transactions of .0004.  So confusing.

I am unclear on what exactly armory does, their website seems fairly vague.  Is it about convenience or does it supply some additional layer of security that I can't get with running live cds, encrypting backups and storing on various media?

I checked each block but didn't see anything regarding refund transactions.  Each transaction took around 40 minutes from "Received Time" to "Included in blocks"  I am not familiar with refund transactions.

Take detailed notes immediately of everything you know about your setup and what you have done.  Turn off the machine and find someone to help you recover.  Also, what wallet program were you using?  Unless your wallet created new addresses and moved all your coins there there isn't any way for your private keys to your addresses to change.

Multibit running on a USB instance of puppy linux.  Multibit doesn't require the blockchain, I run from a wallet on a truecrypt encrypted volume that is backed up to the cloud as well as to a couple usb drives.

You don't have to wait for synchronisation.  You now have the private key to that address and can access any coins that will ever live there.

I love campbx, I moved btc to an account there a little over a year ago and have had no issue.  Last week I went through the verification process so I can move USD into my account and the process took 5 days.  Quick and easy.

Don't run it from windows.  Get a 16G usb drive and download puppy linux, use YUMI to setup the ISO on the usb drive and run your client from linux.

I bought 30btc at a little over $3 a piece.  And through a series of greedy stupid moves ultimately ended up with 11btc total.  Kicking myself for not investing more than $100 initially.  Kicking myself for not buying and holding.

I don't quite understand the burial method.  Seems a bit antiquated to me.  Why not store your keys in a truecrypt volume and store the encrypted volume in various cloud networks?  Want hardcore? Hide the truecrypt volume in a memorable jpg image or mp4.   Your bitcoins are a metal detector sweep away from being discovered.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:26:20
It isn't this hard.  Burying bitcoin isn't secure and it isn't how most secure their coins.  A truecrypt volume backed up to a cloud network and a usb/cd is all you need. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:15:22
You can easily move btc in and out of your account.
