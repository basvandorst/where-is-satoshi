Thank you for comment.
I had already thought that for some it would sound this way. But it really is a real event, so much so that today I defend what I believe, as for my gains today. Every week I update so that other people see and take initiative to start on bitcoin, be it through what I say, buying and saving other currencies, no matter how long they take action.

Time does not return my friend, as Samuel Downpour said:
"I’m not upset. This is the time for all those who thought they had lost the boat to board".

Friend, you can consider whatever you want. No one is forcing you to anything. And Scam is for people who take a bias and stuff things wrong. The company is standing, paying very well. And I will indicate yes what I believe in, but in the end the choice will always be yours. Do not be a hater :)

I do not doubt, being a little more realistic I think that bitcoin will hit the mark of 100 thousand dollars by 2020.

Thank you, broh.
Yes you should know where you are putting your money. Preferably never leave all the eggs in the same basket. It should be even more cautious when we talk about bitcoin, where there are already thousands of scams,

I agree. But the opportunity to invest at an affordable price is now.
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:07:28
next target $3.040,00

It's a smooth scroll, it's working perfectly here. Both on the desktop and on my cell phone. But I'll take a look, thanks for the feedback.

Thank you very much, I am very happy with this comment. I want to spread to everyone what I believe, I always hope to be able to pass on a clean idea, again thank you.

For me Bitcoin will reach the price between 4-6 thousand dollars at the end of the year.
