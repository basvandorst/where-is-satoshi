This is a loan backing issue. Your ability to pay back a loan comes from steady cash flow and recurring obligations.
Banks look at up to a year worth of financial data when you buy a home. They will ask you questions about every unscheduled deposit.
“Why did your mom send you $3k?”
“Where did this $1k withdraw go?”
They won’t buy a $400,000 home for you if they can’t tell where your $100k deposit came from. 
This is sort of like kyc for real estate. They are afraid that you are an empty suit for someone else’s investments.

A 10% change a day is $100 if you put in $1,000. Over two weeks that is $3,797 by the end of 14 Days. Minus the 1k investment that leaves $2,797. 
That is more than a two week pay check on a 50k job. 
A 50k job pays out, after taxes and 401k, about $1,500 per two week check. 
That is over $500 a week better.
Of course, that growth won’t last all year. But as it stands I’m making more off bitcoin than my actual job, per day.

If you don’t mind the $30 hard wire transfer that your bank charges then bitflyer is a breeze. 
Requires Id and ssn. Super legit exchange. Never ha d a problem.

Do not transfer it for them. Do not suggest a way to do it. Do not tell them how.

As it should be. The internet before net neutrality took over the world. Spread like a virus and found its way into everything. Connection speeds climbed and pricing went down. 
After NN, the Internet got more and more expensive. Ads everywhere. Free speech minimized as sites blocked accounts for saying unapproved messages. No innovation. Broken promises. 
NN was a deal between the existing tech giants and the gov to hold onto power. The put a bow and a fancy name on it. Seeing nearly all young people support NN is why it has to go.

When the Blockchain forks, I receive property who’s cost basis its initial trading value. When it dives that’s counts as my loss. 
Example: I buy btc at 1k it moons to 10k. I then owe capital gains on 9k if I sell at that high. 
But... I received a property asset called bcash at 10k which then dropped to 2k.   I took a 8k loss when I cash out at the bottom. 
What if bcash was a tax write off for the rich?

Just wait till car salesmen can create bitcoin by creating car loans to be paid back in btc. Then banks can gather those loans and borrow against their worth to buy actual btc. 
This is how it happens. There is no stopping it. This is inflation. 
They gov will then allow brokers to sell more btc than actually exists as long as the uncollected amount on exchanges doesn’t exceed a percentage of daily trade volume.

Assuming everyone here is going to do no research and just lie to you....

This means that they will have a ton of extra money to invest in other non essential business models like upgrading to bitcoin payment processing. 
The already well off will also have more money to take a chance on investments. 
Bitcoin came at the right time. Our economy is about to explode and btc will most likely rise that wave up to being a force to be reckoned with.

Hopefully we can move to a coin agnostic system. The federal reserve could develop a controlled-distributed node system for a new iTax coin. Run a node in each state for confirmations. Require all domestic purchase be done on iTax compliant devices and switch to a national sales tax instead of our progressive income tax system. 
Allow any buyer/seller transaction to take place, preferably over a system like req where I can pay with a fav coin and the seller can receive in any coin they like. I can then buy iTax coins at the point of sale or open a payment channel to cover the cost with already purchased coins. Buying iTax tokens would allow me to invest in future tax obligations. All spent coins return to the federal reserve Blockchain and can then be resold to generate funds for the government.

Right now, I could make more over 20 years with 9k in bitcoin than a poor person can earn in a lifetime working minimum wage. Think about that, I can make their whole life worth with a few mouse clicks. 
This is how the dystopian  future happens.  People who have corporate jobs will be taken care of. Live in a nice place behind the gates and shop at other big company stores. The others who make it will be anyone with digital money kept in the citadel. 
Everyone else fights it out with nothing to show for it. Now way to earn. No way to climb up. No government program to help. 
When fiat falls. So does governments hold on people.

2 friends of mine got rich with fiat. They want bitcoin to fail. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:23:49
 No. It is legal tender in japan. If the us gov banned it then there would be pop up bitcoiner tourist agencies over night. 
They would sell Tokyo vacation packages for bitcoin. Payment do upon landing.

You are missing the point. At the end of every day, a glitchy site like Coinbase probably realizes that they ‘promised’ 100 btc and only bought 90. No big deal. Only 50 coins were downloaded to hardware wallets. 
They just buy more tomorrow and nobody is the wiser. As long as trading volume is high than the market orders can go through and nobody cares. Eventually, across all brokerages, these ‘extra coins’ add up. They are not worthless because they still fit inside the daily trade volume. It wouldn’t be an issue until the total number of overpromised coins exceeded the daily trade volume. 
Just like how everyone can’t go to the bank at once.

But the futures market isn’t a hard roll out. One goes live this Sunday. Then another next week. One in japan soon. Etc... 
There isn’t really a futures day! It is more like a slow futures month or so...

It is in Hong Kong and doesn’t touch fiat. 
Good luck with that.

I have unmedicated ocd. ( and not the made up kind. I have a psychiatrist)
I will own a whole coin. I can’t let it go.

Well, I technically did invest a little today. My employer did a 25% match into my 401k.
So I’ll just sit here. Twiddling my thumbs. Not listening to the little devil on my shoulder.
Little devil : “doooooo iiiiiiiiiiit”

Don’t feel bad. The plan is to hodl until 2040 anyway.

When you own 1/4 coin and it is a lot of money to you and then the banks gets involved on the Blockchain 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:14:10
I wouldn’t even leave a grand on that exchange 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:56:09
You don’t add those extra btc to the block chain. As long as the daily trade volume is higher than the outstanding unassigned coins you would never actualize the problem. 
That’s the problem. It’s inflation. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:20:22
I am. I’m about to wire over my first 1k to the bitflyer account I set up and tested $100 on.
I’m going to wait and see if these idiots try to sink the price his Sunday when the futures start trading and then pick up a little edge. 
Then see you in 2050.

This sentiment will be why this market comes to an end.
If you destabilize the us, your bitcoin will be worthless. Property has no value without western democracy. 
Your future can be dismantled with the swipe of a pen.

Well they would also rather eat avocado toast everyday than buy a home so....

Bitcoin supports : its a perfect math based paradise! It will stabilize the world economy! Future here we come!
Also bitcoin supports : ok, look guys, we know this is extremely high risk.

You could make it illegal for any bank to covert it to cash and start making arrests. Hat would pretty much do it overnight. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:57:02
At this point, even risking $1000 would only net 10k before tax if bitcoin goes to 100,000 
The days of getting rich are over. At best it is a spicy investment. Let the big funds take over and use it to hedge out stuff like junk bonds.

The fact that hard forking is even possible is why crypto currency in general has a major problem. 
We can all just vote that someone should have money?
I’m sure an elitist circle of people would love to be able to vote who is rich instead of counting up who is rich

I’m pretty sure genx is moving most of their wealth to btc because they don’t trust the younger generation not to raid everyone’s private property. 
Millennials will raid everyone’s retirement to fund their brave new world

Sort of dangerous. 
1. Minor exchanges form a majority opinion and form rules to take away business from others
2. The major exchanges create Barriers to entry to stifle completion

Um... all of those people want to make money on bitcoin. They just don’t want you to as well. That’s why they crash the market. To get you out of the game.

@_date: 2018-02-25 02:52:56
It is the only kind that is left. It is not usually this obvious because you are knowledgeable about the subject matter. 
Think of all the times you turn to them to listen about hints you don’t directly know. They are probably just as wrong then

Don’t be delusional. You have to have a fully functioning internet and electrical grid for bitcoin to exist.

This will all blow over after the launch of the jibrel (jnt) (aka... SorosCoin) goes live and they stop their organized fud campaign. 
This is what soros does. Trash markets for profit. Now he and Saudi backers have a convenient tether alternative. 
Keep in mind, if soros is in crypto it is because he wants dearly to dethrone Usd. Now he wants to replace tether with a Saudi backed tether alternative. This is where all the fud has been coming from.
