Only if you held that btc for less than a year. More than a year and it’s Capital Gains, which is lower. Huge hassle tracking every little trade/purchase though.

In my experience, the bubble/ponzi/other scam types are just spouting received opinion. It’s never based on a factual analysis. They’ve never heard of the previous spikes.

it's not the price, it's the mtGox victims. One or two dogecoiners responded to people's stories about losing huge amounts of BTC to Gox by tipping them some DOGE, which isn't really classy.

aww, you're stuck, aren't you? Today you learned that the whole world isn't Win XP and Visual Studio. I'm honestly incredibly disappointed that you didn't even try to google this shit. I guess you don't know much about computers. 
The CS world is far, _far_ more complex than you know. You can spend a whole career on something like LISP, or graph theory proofs, or logical statements in a language you invented (like MIZAR), and never have to install a printer or prevent brats from fucking with each other. 
BTW, the answer to all of these is basically the same thing: weak permissions checking and remote access. These are all variants of unix, so users (other students) can log into them via ssh. That's 'secure shell' to you. Maybe you know about telnet? The 'eject' utility doesn't care who's calling it, it just ejects. It doesn't check if the caller is the local session. The unix 'talk' utility didn't care that someone was using the HPUX desktop, so it'd blast the text into the screen and scroll up. Hilarious, actually. XPilot needs a lot of CPU, so when I was flying, cloaked, near someone, I'd log into their machine and start a few netscape processes. They'd lag massively and I'd drop a bomb next to them. Boom! 
There are so many other simple, obvious things, but it's not worth my time to teach you. Good luck.

okay, buddy. Since you've "actually _earned_" that title (B.SC. ? ), lemme throw a couple of really simple computer config problems at you. You should know these off of the top of your head if this kind of stuff is as simple as you say.
Students are reporting the CD tray of their machines opening at mysterious intervals while they're listening to music. Why is this happening? Stop this from happening. 
Students are reporting graphical corruption while using the desktop, which appears to be text shoving the screen contents upwards vertically. 
Oh, btw, one of these is happening in an HPUX lab, the other one in a Solaris lab. 
-edit- I'm throwing in an easy Linux one in case you don't know your way around HPUX and Solaris machines.
Students are playing XPilot on the network, and report the game freezing up for a few seconds, followed by their ship exploding. This one should be immediately obvious. 
I've only used examples that I personally discovered and learned how to prevent _while I was an undergrad in 1999_.

Sure, and von Braun built his own rockets. You don't expect Neil DeGrasse Tyson to be in a clean room, assembling the motors and installing the cameras onto new x-ray telescopes, do you? Do you dismiss him as a scientist because he wouldn't be able to do that?

Generally flash malware is served to people via ads in free content (porn) sites with lax rules/security about their ads. xtube, redtube etc etc, even livejournal have been caught multiple times serving ads that were drive-by infections. So these people get trojan'd, their machine calls home (usually an IRC channel) after the trojan embeds itself. 
At this point, what's usually happened is the trojan has replaced OS components, this is known as a 'rootkit'. Now it's undetectable. At least until related OS components are updated and something in the fake versions breaks.
