In a free market, the government doesn't interfere with the _market_.  It still may choose to interfere with individual actors who are committing fraud against other participants in said market.  
Without laws against fraud, you don't have a free market, you have Somalia.  Or, put another way, you can't take away my right to enact private retribution against a bad actor without putting a state-based mechanism in place to punish bad actors, or there's no incentive whatsoever to be a _good_ actor, and you won't have much of a market for very long.

If you get in before the nightly batch cutoff (1700ish, depends on the bank), you generally wind up doing interbank transfers in the next nightly batch (tue through sat early AM, corresponding with the mon through fri bank working days.)  On the weekend, you're screwed, since you don't wind up with your transaction being cleared until the mon night/tue AM batch, so a saturday transfer shows up on tuesday.
Has been my experience with multiple .au banks, anyway.

Depends entirely on the battery tech.  Batteries with inbuilt regulation/charge circuitry (Lithiums, mostly) certainly work the way you're describing; Pb-acid cells, as a counterpoint, will lose voltage over the course of their discharge cycle (I've seen 12v PbAcid batteries read 8-9v when mostly discharged.)  Regardless, it's certainly not linear.  1350mV is a lot closer to 'flat' than 'nearly still full.'

Given that the only "evidence" that you can get out of the encrypted part of a wallet is the private keys that let you spend coins associated with the wallet, it's reasonably easy to imagine making the argument that bitcoin wallets aren't "evidential material".

The issue seems to be that gox (due to using the txid to track outbound payments) has pissed a whole heap of BTC into the wind by repeatedly re-sending transactions that it thought were missing.
The only way to exploit this would be to withdraw coins and then tamper with your own TX before it got mined.  You'd think, if everything we've been told is true enough, that gox would have records showing who it was who got repeatedly paid.
Of course, we don't live in an ideal world, and it's possible that either gox didn't keep logs when they re-sent a 'failed' transaction, or that the accounts exploiting this issue were themselves compromised.

It's not "in the blockchain", it's been relayed over the p2p network and exists in the mempool of any node which was online when you submitted it to your peers (these nodes can then mine for it if they want to.)

The RPC protocol used by bitcoin mining is just HTTP, so as long as your proxy server allows connections out on port 8332 (or whatever), you should be good.  Might mean you need to hack your miner to support proxying requests, but that wouldn't be hugely hard.
Having said that, CPU mining is a complete, total and utter WOFTAM.  The extra power that you're costing your employer (or whoever) is likely worth less than any fractions of a BTC you're going to get from a pool.

Miners (pools and solo miners, but not individual pooled miners) decide which transactions they want to include in the block they're trying to solve, which is the _current_ block.  This block includes, amongst other things, a hash of its predecessor block.
Transaction fees incentivize pools and solo miners to include your transaction in the block they're working on.  However, in order for this block to be viable, it HAS to reference the immediately proceeding block.  Accordingly, confirmation  is affected by fees (without fees, you could theoretically NEVER get confirmation   Confirmation  (block n+1, where block n is the block that included your transaction) has exactly NOTHING to do with the fees you paid to get your transaction into block n, and everything to do with block n being considered a valid block by the rest of the network (which will happen as long as somebody else didn't generate a block at almost exactly the same time.)  This notwithstanding, block n+1 *must* include block n's hash.  Block n+2 must include block n+1's hash, etc.  Accordingly, confirmation  and up have *nothing* to do with the fees paid to get the transaction into block n.

Not all, it depends on the interface.  Anything that presents a block device to the host is going to be running some kind of translation layer, but there are definitely applications where access to raw flash is both possible and a good thing (see, for instance the Ubi volume manager and UbiFS.)  You definitely need to do some kind of block remapping/write coalescing/etc, but it doesn't need to be done in firmware.

Yea, see, this is what keeps happening to Namecoin.  Difficulty adjusts up, so the mining arbitrageurs go back to mining BTC.  This leaves the remnant hashing power (around 80GH/s atm) unable to solve a block in much under an hour (on average), leading to ~2016 hours (about 3 months) until the difficulty adjusts back down again, at which point the arbitrageurs show up again.
The real impact isn't on the ability to mine economically, but on the fact that generations take upwards of a week to confirm, and transactions can take half a day to get a handful of confirmations.
IMO, the next upgrade to the protocol should use some kind of adaptive algorithm to calculate the next difficulty point, instead of a fixed 2016 blocks like it is now.

I do exactly this.  I've got 2x 6950 and a 6670 in the x58 board that's been powering my fileserver/iscsi host, and there's no impact on hashrate -- the 6670 gets comparable numbers to an identical card i'm running in a windows box, and the 6950s are doing about 350MH/s each (with a mild OC to 850).
The only issue was replacing the PSU so I could power 3 GPUs, 12 disks and an i7 stably.  Got a Antec truepower new 750W (good for 740W-ish on the 12V rails) for $140ish, problem solved.

The GTX580 has 512 shaders, period.  There is no distinction made (since G80) between SP types (actually, this isn't 100% accurate; hull and domain shaders under Dx11 probably use the tesselation units, although I haven't played much with this.)  Each SP can issue one MUL and one MADD per clock.

Remove the end.  The front part of PCIe is for in-slot power and housekeeping tasks, the data is carried across one or more 10B/8B pairs ('lanes' in PCIe parlance), with each lane being good for 500MB/s (assuming PCIe 2.)
Removing the back of the slot allows the much larger x16 connector to fit into the x1 connector, and mate up with the first lane (as well as the bit before the divider.)  Of course, it means your CPU can only talk to the card at 250-500MB/s, but for mining bitcoins that's utterly a non-issue.

NVIDIA cards have a number of individual processors (300-400ish IIRC), each of which can dispatch a MUL and a MADD in a single cycle.
ATI cards have a comparable number of processors, but each processor can dispatch 5 (or 4) operands to the same instruction in each cycle (the so-called Very Long Instruction Word approach, comparable to how itanic worked.)  ATI (somewhat disingenuously IMO) market this as the "shader count" (counting each VLIW slot as a unique "shader".)
Long and the short of it, under most real world scenarios, you're going to be able to keep all your instruction slots full during a fragment program or during something like a SHA256 OpenCL kernel, where you're not limited by needing to schedule the same instruction across 4-5 operands per clock.  For something like SHA256, nvidia's ability to rock a MUL and a MADD in the same EU at the same time is about as useful as a boat anchor on a bathtub, whereas it's INCREDIBLY useful in fragment shaders.
TL;DR SHA256 is 100% integer maths and can take almost complete advantage of VLIW, whereas being able to run a MUL behind your MADD buys you almost nothing.
If you have a look at your GPU core temperature while running a CUDA miner on it, you'll note that it'll hit a point somewhere between Tidle and Tmax, where Tmax is the temp the GPU runs at under, say, OCCT's furmark test, or, say, crysis warhead with 'enthusiast' shaders.

Transactions without a fee are constrained to the "low priority" section of a block, which is not very large.  Additionally, there's no incentive for pools or soloists to include no-fee transactions in blocks.  People are doing it now because the transaction volume is low enough that it doesn't fucking matter, and the main payoff is the "generation" BTC, not the tx fees.  Over time, this balance will change.


After your transaction gets included in a block, the fee becomes irrelevant (i.e. confirmations 2-8 will happen at the same speed regardless of tx fee paid, since any subsequent blocks are downstream of the block which had your tx in it.)  A fee is going to (probably) get your first confirmation faster (and will certainly do so further down the track when generation starts to halve.)

Each bitcoind compiles a list of transactions that it wants to include in its block.  This can vary between bitcoinds.  When a new block is propagated (and validated) by the network, any transactions in that block are removed from any work that any other bitcoind is trying to do, and a new candidate block is generated.
Each bitcoind (one per solo miner or pool, typically) can have its own list of rules for which transactions it will/won't include.
Each attempt to solve a block has a 1/(2 ^ 32 . difficulty) chance of succeeding.  If it fails (failure has a 1-(1/2 ^ 32 . difficulty) probability), then the nonce changes and another attempt is made.  Each attempt to solve the block has the same chance as any other attempt.  Like tossing a coin.  Previous work has no bearing on the chance of success of future work, so somebody else finding a block has no bearing on the likelihood of success or failure of any other miner.

Generating more or less one incredibly hard-to-solve proof of work every 10 minutes or so, in order to guarantee that as long as at least 51% of the total computing power of the network isn't trying to fuck with transactions, transactions can't be fucked with (by, say, trying to solve an alternate block chain in which coins were spent to a different address.)
The higher the overall hashing power of the network, the higher the difficulty of the proof of work adjusts, meaning that in the absence of any sinister conspiracies, the barrier-to-entry for somebody trying to subvert the chain of verified transactions increases while transactions still get their first confirmation in within 10 minutes.

How are they going to validate the password without keeping a copy of the salt on the validating side?  Everything that uses password hashes (in my experience) keeps a copy of the salt locally.  Otherwise you have to iterate across your entire salt space (looking at the hash of a friend's account he pasted on irc, the salt is 8 chars long) every time you authenticate somebody, which could take quite some while.

As somebody who's been involved in the architecture, development and operation of distributed transaction-processing systems for some fairly high end companies, this is a load of shit.  "Lag" (i.e. above 'normal' transaction processing delay) is nothing more than a function of load vs the ability to handle that load.  Of course, since nobody wants to own more infrastructure than is strictly required to handle their AVERAGE load, peak load can cause "lag" and there's not a lot you can do about it (this is why people have such a hardon for EC2 and clouds in general at the minute.)
Now, I've got no idea how well the gox backend is capable of scaling, and no idea how much hardware they're throwing at the problem, but to say that "only small, low volume systems" are immune to lag is oversimplifying the problem so much it's disingenuous.
If Gox is serious about keeping its position as the "leading" exchange, then they need to be able to scale to the average transactions per second that people are going to throw at them.  If they can't do that, then market forces need to drive people elsewhere (why the hell this isn't already happening far more than it is I can't say.)

Anyone with a few hundred million could do this trivially; all it'd take would be the design of a SHA ASIC and somebody taking the design to TSMC and going 'hey you, make a few hundred thousand of these.'
Not difficult at all, just a pretty big barrier to entry (and trying to do this sort of thing on a shoestring gets you the kinds of problems BFL have had.)  Any sufficiently funded adversary won't have these problems.
Of course, instead of just doing a 51%-style attack, a hypothetical adversary would be far better off just throwing a few PH/s at the blockchain for 2160 blocks or so to jack the difficulty up into the hundreds of millions, and then turn all the ASICs off.  Bitcoin wouldn't be very useful if each block took multiple hours to find with the network's residual hashing power.

Since you get the generation payment regardless of how many transactions you include in a block, the optimal strategy is to include every transaction whose fee exceeds some arbitrary threshold which the market will settle on.

With sufficient interest in bitcoin, ASIC hashing power will follow Moore's law (it's not quite there yet; I believe BFL are using a 65nm process and Avalon use 110nm chips), and with enough volume, such coprocessors will become common place and reasonably inexpensive.

VIA already did this on the C7; it took a CPU that generated ~200KH/s up to about 1MH/s, i.e. a roughly 5fold improvement.
Of course, the C7 is a single, in-order core clocked in the low single GHz range, but even if you assume a scaling factor of 60 between this C7 and a single modern Xeon core (which is probably too much, but figure the xeon is clocked roughly 3 times as high, can issue multiple hypothetical SHA256 instructions out of order, etc) giving you a roughly 360x improvement relative to the C7 on a modern 6-way xeon, this works out in the order of 300-400MH/sec (at, for arguments' sake, ~150W load, which is about right for a modern xeon).

You can only peg prices to a local currency if your suppliers are charging you in that currency or if the exchange rate variance is low enough that you're prepared to wear the loss in the name of amenity.
This won't happen until the BTC domestic economy gets large enough for second- and third-tier service providers to provide a 'domestic' service (with suppliers charging THEM in BTC) or the exchange rate to major fiat gets stable enough that suppliers (and customers for that matter) are prepared to eat any variance.

This hasn't happened yet because it's never going to be financially profitable.  If your expected profit isn't financial, though, the equation changes.

Any idiot who wants to avoid big OEMs can pay a guy a salary to import white box parts from Taiwan and assemble them (scale according to taste).  At least then any backdoors will have been put there by your motherboard manufacturer, and not some OEM middleman.

There's enough variance between board manufacturers (and their ROM customizations) that it's quite difficult to engineer a one-size-fits-all solution and weaponize it.
If you're worried, just reflash (although it's possible to imagine a world where such a virus would also suborn the bios's flash programming tool such that any subsequent flashes were also infected, but that's just evil; if you're worried about that, you'll need to program your BIOS ROMs with an external programmer somehow.)

My take on it is a bit different.  The market, ultimately, is going to decide what these "alt coins" are worth, with most people considering the obvious "copycat" ones largely worthless.  Their existence and ability to be traded on exchanges like btc-e, though, uses the market's valuation to effectively add additional liquidity to the bitcoin ecosystem (since there's fuck all friction present trying to exchange two cryptocurrencies beyond that added by exchanges, who are themselves competing to provide the most frictionless exchange service.)
If any of them _are_ utterly worthless, their value will ultimately trend to 0 BTC and they'll become a historical footnote (see also: any number of bitcoin forks which are currently completely worthless.)  Any that aren't worthless are, like bitcoin, a useful way to store value and transact with it.  Corollary to this is that the only entity qualified to _make_ this determination is the market at large.  Not Luke-jr (despite his attack on coiledcoin and his campaign against litecoin on wikipedia), not you, and not I.
If BTC-e shut down tomorrow, the people who want to trade these alt coins will go to bitparking or vircurex or somewhere else.  Any idiot can run a crypto-&gt;crypto exchange (that's the point of bitcoin and its derivatives, any idiot can accept them with basically 0 effort.)
None of this, of course, addresses the 'pump and dump' side of things, but the market will take care of that on its own.  Does anyone seriously think Feathercoin or CHNcoin are worth what they're being valued at on the various cryptocurrency exchanges at the minute?  A bubble, which will likely burst, with some greater fool or other left holding the bag.
