Sorry, but we dont see it this way. if we can fight it, or at least prevent even 10% of it we will keep working on such a solution.

the issue was with the description is too long (we only allow 500 chars), we've reported your fraud and fixed the server to cut the extra data for now, tomorrow we also load a fix in the site that will show char count and limit while typing.
thank you very much and sorry for the inconvenience.

we love this discussion! it is very informative and gives us new ideas regarding the way our system should work.
wayside113, it looks like you have a lot on your mind with such a system. 
We have simple question, would you want to prevent theft, abuse and fraud with bitcoins?
due to the fact that it is very hard to have a discussion in reddit (5 minutes limitation) it would be nice if you can move it to our twitter

we have full time stuff... most of us work pro bono and most of us also built systems like this one for banks and credit card cooperates. we are so happy we have a chance to do the same for something much bigger!

don't think we will be able to force our beliefs, we do think that this kind of process is needed, and most people that uses bitcoin or altcoins don't understand security, the importance of protecting their wallet or their wallet password, if we want bitcoin or any coin to be an alternative to money we need to make it commodity and by that make it simple and secure by default for everyone.
we weren't thinking everyone will want it, but we also didn't think that people that use it in generic / legal was will say that they don't want such system to help them. 
I'm personally very intrigued by this type of thinking and trying to understand it better.

sorry for that. it is up for the last few hours now :)
we didn't expect to exceed the quota so fast, but we are happy that we were wrong.

probably nothing you are doing wrong, but we dont see the error you got in our system. you can post the information here and we will add the fraud ourselves, it will also give us the chance to see the error with out eyes and fix it asap.

Great question! We just released this simple site now to to give people a way to start adding data. we started in an trusting perspective, we didn't even limited adding data using captcha. 
We are focusing our development on Realtime analyzes of all transactions, the system will use the users input for more data, but users data is not going to determine the final scoring, it is going to be a small part of it.
We already started analyzing taint addresses and linking addresses to each other.
The API we are going to release will allow wallet services and any sites that uses coins to check the scoring with our system in realtime and more important, wallet services will be able to use our service to report any suspicious activity detected in there system, that way all wallets will have a central place to correlate all data giving them the information they need before initiating a transaction.

we thought about it and we have several ways to prevent it, some related to server2server integration with different services, and some related to actually working with the community on changes we would like to implement.
