Oh and I assume you know bitcoin's exact intrinsic value.

The craziest part about that link was finding out he has 49 kids. That guy is a living meme.
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:24:49
Show how stupid you are lol. Why don't you go read about fires and this thing called exchange rates.
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:09:58
If bitcoin actually was worth 10 million per coin there would be no need to sell it. Think about the ramifications if bitcoin was worth that much. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:42:21
Okay, well that's really odd to respond to a month old post. The current low all isn't below the ath that occurred before the dip pervious to this post. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:22:49
Look how old the post is 
@_date: 2018-10-08 22:07:43
Yes, but does it have any partnerships? /s
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:12:31
Yup, pack it up bois. Bitcoin is dead.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:04:30
Whenever it goes into effect.

Crypto is a fraction of the size of the dotcom bubble, and we all know plenty of companies that are worth far more now than what they were during the bubble. Bitcoin and ether along with many other coins will be worth even more 10 years from now, even if there is a crash for crypto.

This is an amazing copypasta

Google how futures contracts work.

Give it 24 hours
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:41:35
You can tell a bunch of noobs have joined the game because of all the recent bubble talk. Just keep watching for that dip. I'm sure it'll happen around 15k, and if you're lucky we'll see 11k ��
Truth is you all are the next wave of adopters and after you realize that the next bullish wave will hit. After that it's just rinse wash and repeat until we see 100k.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:32:21
That's either how fast corrections happen now or a lot of brokers have shutdown to stop the plummet temporarily. Guess we'll find out shortly.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:46:13
Literally infinite money
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:18:10
I bet you were saying that at 4k
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:18:50
"Bizarre hypothetical" 
Go have fun shorting bitcoin. I give you 2 weeks before you get a margin call.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:43:39
Lmao coinbase is the last place that would support some shady scam like this. Go away troll.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:11:23
Clearly aliens are in control of the cryptos.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:29:26
He just said it’ll go down more...
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:02:54
I'd guess around 15k?
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:32:35
Ok, now what 
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:18:37
It'll be 10k by tomorrow, so don't worry
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:41:14
6448, mark my words 
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:30:39
He asked 3-6 months. I think most people are expecting 30-50k by the end of 2018. Unless this thing keeps picking up steam, then who knows what'll happen.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:25:21
My own local bank was too stupid to complete a simple wire transfer, and took days to tell me they couldn't do it. With bitcoin I completed the transaction in a matter of hours. That's why I think bitcoin is the future. Bitcoin was more competent than all those employees combine.
Fuck banks
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:48:01
Generally speaking, loaned money is the very definition of money that you can’t afford to lose. If bitcoin crashes in the next few weeks, then you may as well have taken a loan out and then lit the money in fire. 
Maybe it’s just me but taking a loan out to trade with sounds like one of the dumbest things imaginable. It seems like your bank is thinking the same thing if they’ll only give you 600 euros.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:20:12
Why don't you short bitcoin if you're so confident?
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:44:02
It's memes all the way down
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:37:02
Ask your mom. She earned it ��
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:32:27
This article says bitcoin's climb is going to slow down now. I how they're wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:25:04
10 dollars to 100 dollars is harder than 10k to 100k imo
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:26:11
That's like saying the internet is just a fad. Crypto is obviously the next stage for how humans use currency.

Like literally 3 weeks ago. Percentage wise this wasn't even a big drop.

I think you got lost in your way to @_date: 2017-11-03 17:38:58
Lol bitcoin is dead if it crashes below 1k, don’t even kid yourself. Some other crypto currency will pick up the torch at that point. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:04:37
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:50:37
It's going to sub 400 dollars. This was all a crypto coup from the ethereum clan.

Because if you call it a bubble when it's valued at 130 billion, but it keeps climbing to say 10 trillion before a significant correction occurs were you ever really right? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:03:07
Bitcoin market cap is at 167 billion, not 300 billion lmao
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:43:54
The financial world keeps trying to knock bitcoin down, but it just keeps climbing. Bitcoin is the ultimate underdog.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:14:58
I don't understand why people get fixated on the concept of having to own a lot of coins.
