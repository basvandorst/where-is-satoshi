You read correctly. Welcome to the new world. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:24:59
The market is crashing and there is a lot of panicking. Breath and read below. 
1. The last time I checked, the technology is still great and the mathematics still checks out. There are no known exploits and the only error is human based at this point. Tech check = Green. 
2. The mining difficulty is still extremely healthy and is showing signs of significant growth. This growth is a representation factor of security on the network. See the growth for yourself and this is my true north in being guided. PoW health check = Green. 
3. The only time you realize a loss is when you sell. If you bought at a high price there is a high likelihood the price will surpass that point in a few years with far greater returns. Don't expect a quick recovery but learn as much as you can about the underlying technology to help reaffirm your hodl position. Belief check = Green. 
4. The maximum supply is still limited by code and driven by consensus to 21,000,000 bitcoin. This will never change and isn't decided by one person or entity. This is the golden rule of bitcoin. Now understand only 21 million people can own a single bitcoin and appreciate the store of wealth opportunity this provides. Deflationary check = Green. 
5. The users, wallets, merchant, regulators and  governments adoption is at an all time high and rapidly increasing. This isn't about a commodity or wealth movement. This is about a transparent and decentralized movement. It isn't stopping and there are no borders. Growth check = Green.
6. The protocol remains superior as a governance model to digital asset owernship and immutability of ledger entry. The world of tangible and non-tangible assets are being stored on-chain or anchored. This means your entire digital world will have a ownership structure driven by blockchain. Internet of things check = Green 
7. Buying on the way down is a great way to enjoy the market fear, uncertainty and doubt. Capitalize on this and wait for the top again if you believe. My grandfather taught me that is not the day you sell when you make money, it's the day you buy. Cheap coins = Check 
It looks like all things that matter are Green. Letting the price guide decisions about bitcoin and blockchain technology as just commodities and not protocols will lead to poor investment choices.

Namecoin can be ported onto Bitcoin as a Sidechain. It is best to use the Bitcoin network security as an added bonus to resilience from attack. I am a huge fan of .bit domains and of namecoin itself but in the long run I don't believe it can stand on it's own.

Not entirely. You may write software yes, but application of said software is another story. There are developers that build with specific markets in mind and sometimes this software may infringe on legal boundaries and that is where the regulator uptake may comes into the picture.

Make a paper wallet and encrypt the private key with passphrase using bip0038 - You can use  for this. Give your family the location of your keys and the passphrase. I am assuming here you are trusting your family to not access your funds pre-death. An alternative is to use a multisig tool like  (2 n 3) and share one key with a family member and the other with a lawyer who will execute your will apon death.

Great paper. It examines the incentives for miners by exploring miner fees and blockrewards. The research considers off-chain pegged and lightning as solutions for micropayments. The conclusions is that fees may be increased over time and become the core revenue stream for miners within 5 years. It also leans towards bitcoin transactions being used for clearance and settlement as the inflated fee model will force consumers to use alternative solutions (pegged/lightning) for daily transactions.

As a commercial miner I am impressed with their cooling systems (or lack thereof).

Why? I don't think people should stop as it will encourage new generation of hardware to be developed. New gen hardware is more efficient and more efficient hardware is better for the environment and the bitcoin network security. New generation hardware also help remove the corner on centralization of mining to a lesser degree.

To say that a person thinking about plausible scenarios given the current present variables is paranoid then you are not thinking outside the box.  Don't be fooled for a second that the mining market is not controlled by a few players and they have a lot of money invested at this point. They will do anything to capitalize and I think game theory dictates this will occur.

You are horribly mistaken. In an island like mine, the duties alone on imported electronics make the purchase of a smart phone undesirable and when you throw merchant markups into the mix you have an unaffordable product. Offering a cost effective smart phone allows for a higher penetration rate of users and to someone like me who is looking to serve this market, this means the following:  
  
1. Increased user market  
2. An operating system like android or linux mobile that will support the ease of installation of a bitcoin wallet meaning less hastle for my potential market.  
3. An increase in information education via smart phone capabilities.  
  
This is a great step in smartphone penetration rates in emerging markets.

A salary of $200k is a crappy salary for the guy in a lead development position of a multi-billion dollar operation. I have personally met Gavin and have sat on a panel with him before and can't say he strikes me as someone that can be persuaded to do harm, though this doesn't mean we can blindly trust anyone.   
  
With that being said I don't see the need for him to step aside nor do your points give a reason for him to be "fired".   
  
Gavin has no control over the Bitcoin infrastructure that companies establish in conjunction with governments and therefore doesn't have a say in centralized systems.   
  
The code submits by Gavin are peer reviewed and have large number of eyeballs examining his work consistently.  Gavin is very in touch with the community and engages in public discussion about his development path.   
  
  In the interest of good conversation,  who would you elect to replace him?

That hardware has a shelf-life of 18 months if so much. The dust, lack of AC and wild temperature swings may lower efficiency but not dramatically nor does it justify the expense of investing in a cooling system.

Actually there is a process to digitize all past records and make them publicly available in a digital library for purchase. You don't need a lot of hashing power at all and sending a fractional amount of btc with an embedded hash would easily do the trick. The judgements will sit on a document management system and on the cloud. It's a straight forward process but I see your point in terms of effort - my point is that the court wishes to apply this effort for job creation, revenue generation, efficiency,  security, validation and willingness for innovation.

3% could be their hot wallets and due to the multiple levels of security on cold wallets, theft was unlikely and not probable therefore not needing 100% insurance coverage. I am guessing 3% insurance covers their most vulnerable points of failure. I think it is a wise move and a great standard for other exchange operators to follow..

I don't doubt that there is the possibility of hard forking - however the price will still move in a downward direction. Large miners collude and dump coins on the network for high bids, they then 51% attack the network and try to get away with double spends. They then wait for the market to react to the negative news, the hard fork (or break in emergency glass as Gavin refers to it) and a downward price trend. The next step is to buy low and wait for investor confidence to return.

Do a better job or shut up. I can't think of a more elegant way of putting my thoughts when I read posts like this. You want a good centralized service built around a decentralized solution, then face the music.

Without a doubt Sidechains. The ability to create decentralized assets hinged to the blockchain and confirming mathematically your digital assets are integral.  I love the concept of the network security of the bitcoin mining market coupled with the decentralized platforms that can benefit from such network stability.  Sidechains for me are the winning recipe. Other things that I am as excited about are: Dark wallets, Mike Hearn's Lighthouse project, Blockstream (sidechain dev company), Winkidex, decentralized push and pull exchanges (fleshlight dudes),  changetip, ethereum (not bitcoin related sorta, still excited to see it), HD wallet evolution, trezor multisig, patrick byrne's decentralized stock exchange, microsoft's tinkering with btc (skype maybe?), next generation hsm hardware. 2015 is going to be a fun ride!

Your first part was correct.  Your second part was an assumption. Another assumption and more than likely the random process of block finding which adjusts its difficulty to align with a mean 10 minutes was influence by a very good lottery draw by a few big miners. The next difficulty will adjust to make up for these irregular activities.

I am hoping based on the delay for comment revision we may see an influential approach on how bitcoin is delt with. I am optimistic and think it will be a good entrance point for Wall Street. I know a few dudes waiting for full implementation of the BitLicense before they dabble further into bitcoin.  I am bullish right now because there will be a dip pre-announcement with those assuming it will be the legislative death of bitcoin ... but realistically it will be NY bitcoin business genocide and Wall Street safe haven for investment covered by LawskyLaw. I will trade NY (one of many US States) bitcoin business for Wall Street entry points any day.

1. Altcoins like litecoin, doge, dash etc?   
2. Any examples of who is doing this right? And why would you want to prove you own an address? Do you want the exchange only withdrawing to that address from now on?     
3. What specific API features besides the usual standards?   
4. Why counterparty/XCP? 
@_date: 2015-07-29 23:39:02
$24,000 * 30 days at 2% take home is still $14,000 a month. Not bad for a startup in my opinion, especially when working with niche technology. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 07:16:07
1. I hear you on the ALTcoins. Not everyone wants them listed and the ones that do get listed are usually proven alts like Litecoin. There are factors to consider like security from wallet management. But like I said, I hear you.  
  
2. I get it. So you want to be able to prove to CEX that is was you and your latest deposit from your wallet on Blockchain could confirm that if you could also sign a message using the same key you used to send them. That makes sense to me.   
3. I think most exchange APIs should do it for developers unless they are looking for some next level abnormal calls. I too can't think of anything extraordinary that other exchanges have yet to implement.   
  
4. There is also Omni (Tether), OpenAssets and ColoredCoins (Colu/Prism) etc and then of course sidechains. So you want to see integration of all of these smart assets or just Counterparty?   
  
Also, thats a great idea for the VM but unlike storage it would be kind of hard to reserve RAM and processor speeds of host systems for remote services. I dont see it happening anytime soo.

Multisig could work also. 2 of 3 similar to coinbase.
@_date: 2015-07-14 02:16:03
A beneficiary may be complex in addition to estate attorney for an exchange to manage. I think if you wanted that level of access you should probably be in control of your own private key. I would however say multisig can work; 1 key managed by the exchange, a key generated from your password and authenticated by it, and a third key that is client side created and managed by customers.  This will allow the user to be in control of 2 keys and the exchange to be in control of 1. Technically the exchange has 2 of 3 keys but one of them is dependent on your authentication.

Preach it Eric! We have had that problem in the Caribbean with banks rejecting us. We put wheels into motion that in some islands made them irrelevant (credit unions, atms, cash networks etc). They realize the threat and soon come around with one seeing the light and wanting the jump the crowd to ride the wave. All you need to do is prove your model and hold strong. The banks will come around when their competitors start to integrate.

You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. To be honest, when I read posts like yours I want to lecture individuals like yourself. You have been here since 2016? Buddy, I have been here since 2010. You want PoW gone? Buddy, PoW is the only reason we survived this long and will survive past the others. You honestly need to calm down and learn from PoW represents because if you did then you would never speak this kind of blasphemy.

You probably used the same password for both accounts and it was probably easy to brute force. Otherwise you probably got spoofed and typed in your password and got keylogged or plaintext captured.   
  
You need to learn what 2FA is for the safety of your digital content outside of bitcoin. You just learned a valuable lesson in two factor authorization.

I have to agree with Luke here. We cannot keep kicking the can down the road and putting wheels into motion before they need to be set. The beautiful thing is that we have time to adjust and break the safety glass to increase block sizes **if** we must.

I was a victim of the Gox fiasco. I do not blame anyone but myself to be honest as we all knew the power of bitcoin but handed it off to someone else.

As long as you can guarantee the host machine was in fact disconnected and it will never see a connection again then you are fine. Your biggest problem at this point will be physical security. Have you encrypted the wallet with BIP0038.

It has always had fees and they have been reduced before. If the price rises, the fees will be voted on and reduced as seen in the past.  
Bitcoin can still be about 0 fees if you don't mind waiting and the transaction is void of a double spend. However, when moving a fee dollars, a few cents is not a bad price to pay for swiftness of block confirmation.

You can determine first and foremost that Bitcoin is working as it should from node stats. If your last block found was 6 hours ago or the amount of nodes halved then you have something to worry about like maybe a plummeting price.

I am Gabriel Abed and I will write a blog on where we have come and what we will be doing in the near future. What specifically do you wish to know? 
@_date: 2015-11-30 02:33:10
We have 300,000 citizens to protect. It would be irresponsible of our government to do this.

If they were so concerned about the reserves required they should have taken control of the assets held by the US Marshals before the auction.

I was an attendee at the ID2020 Summit that just concluded at the UN Headquarters in NY. The goal was to bring tech and Government into a room to solve some problems ranging from sex slave trade, to children identity to global identity. Their is one rule that users must be able to control and be in charge of their data, everything else after that is open for discussion. I'm open for discussing a pilot in the island of Barbados and working with regulators to offer a self sovereign digital identity. The discussion is completely open.

I definitely will but not until I think we are worthy  
@_date: 2015-03-30 07:05:44

Pro-tip is appreciated
@_date: 2015-03-04 17:00:08
Right,  that is the issue. FreeOTP may not be trusted by my clients and it will be another app they must download to use my service. Will it be more secure? Maybe. Will their privacy be better protected? Sure. Do they care enough to move away from mainstream tools like Authy? Nope. .... maybe I can add it as an alternative choice ?

What does Ciphrex do?
@_date: 2015-11-19 23:04:42
The only remedy would be eliminating the microprocessor.  That should stop encryption!
@_date: 2015-03-31 11:44:36
As a recent exchange operator who just did a launch, I really appreciate every single service offered. If you have ever run your own exchange or plan to, the route offered here is incredibly efficient.  My team and I had to deploy disaster recovery plans, internal security policies, external security policies, multisig, HD wallets, multicity key distribution, multiple mediums of storage,   etc etc etc... I'm very interested in ThirdKey
@_date: 2017-05-07 06:01:20
This is going to be insane hype for the vertcoin pump. I remember vertcoin very well when I was large scale GPu mining and was happy for the protection they gave my miners.  
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:15:56
The price was rising before the announcement, but imagine if they purchased $116M USD in BTC? 
@_date: 2016-10-19 14:10:36
Don't forget errors from losses in hardware and downtime. This was our biggest lost factor when we mined large scale.

It is not them. It is the clearing house that they have an account with. Because bitcoin is high risk, the fee they charge typically starts at 5%. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 06:05:32
Can someone give a real world sample of an outcome from the above framework?

Exchanges have threats from regulators and not being compliant is a quick way to go out of business. Localbitcoin is a person to person transaction wherever BitQuick is a service and a company that must comply in order to serve you as a customer. 
@_date: 2016-05-07 00:58:55
Yes I do. We at Bitt are currently working on something around the idea of government tax paid as deflationary assets like bitcoin.

It was the risk at the end user they are focusing on from fraud to unregulated push and pull exchanges. I stressed at the working group that blockchain tech remain unhindered from regulation and it was well received.

Thank you man. 
@_date: 2015-03-28 13:39:42
I need to say this to all those that are in support of zero fees and the companies that persue these models. Let me make it perfectly clear that it does cost money and time to run a reputable Bitcoin business and if you are keep on keeping your doors open and providing a stellar service provided to your clients you need cashflow. People don't mind reasonable fees, but going to zero fees has little to do with competition especially when it means your business can shut down as a result (VoS vs. Cavirtex).

I don't see how giving bitcoin the same reputation as any commodity  would help. I think Bitcoin can stand on its own two feet and it will hold a reputation as being decentralized,  secure, transparent, a software protocol and a programmable currency.

You would want to go to a large block brokerage. I know the emails of 3 different guys that do this and I have used them before for large blocks with zero issues. Typically you complete KYC, they ask you for amount, they give you a locked price, you confirm and you have 24-72 hours to complete the payment. A lot of this is reputation driven.

As a Barbadian living and working on the island I can't express how frustrated the citizens are with the expensive banking fees and long lines with inadequate banking infrastructure (less than 30 ATMs per 100k citizens in Barbados compared to 200 ATMs per 100k citizens in USA). Now I'm not saying that digital dollars will absolutely replace cash, I am just saying there is plenty of room for a digital ecosystem and the market is speaking to this fact. Credit cards are widely accepted throughout Barbados and those who don't have been rejected by the banking system or they don't want to pay the starting 3-5% transaction fees. I am also a huge fan of Bitcoin and Barbados :)

I used cloudbet for betting on my favorite teams during the FIFA matches. I liked their UI and they gave me credit on 0 confirmation deposits which was nice of them to take that risk of a double spend. I would recommend them.

Hi, this is the CEO here. I never claimed bitcoin is going to replace banks. I stated there is an alternative solution *if* banks withdraw and de-risk the correspondence relationships in the Caribbean. Ask any questions and I'll be happy to answer them here. I was asked some questions by the journalist and I answered to the best of my ability while trying to be clear on our stance.

This is entirely true and my argument from 2011 for altcoins like peer, lite and name. I do believe it is 100% important to see how the alternative networks and implementations of the blockchain vary.  However, I think sidechains will kill the need to have to create your own altcoin outside of the BTC network.

You can do either and give your customer base an option. The preferred route is to focus on smart phone usability versus USSD codes or SMS. The market is shifting in the direction of smart phones.

Keep in mind I'm not referring to bitcoin the asset when I make this statement, I am referring to Bitcoin the protocol and the cool things you can do with an immutable ledger (like digital Fiat). There is a **fundamental** difference between deploying bitcoin as a system mainstream and Bitcoin digital assets as a localized solution. I hope that clears up the confusion of the bold claim that I believe we can have uptake in 18 months within Barbados utilizing Bitcoin tech.

Coinbase vault is somewhat secure but you are depending on a 3rd party. I used their vault service but during the threat of the hardfork I moved my coins into my own offline wallet. They would not honor longest chain or the second chain (BU) and it meant I could not capitalize or realize gains (or losses) on the forked chain. Always best to control your own keys.

Create a crypt using truecrypt, store your wallet in it and then push it to the cloud if you are that passionate about online personal storage. Otherwise look to use reputable companies like Coinbase as a wallet, just ensure you have 2FA enabled. Be smart, read more and welcome to bitcoin - enjoy your freedom.

No. When you see your market rising you need to adjust to suit or dont take on the business. But being almost directly responsible and the cause of a panic sell is unacceptable when over a Billion dollars got flushed. That means that the sorry sob that sold his house for BTC has lost half its value in 1 day. That hurts growth, trust, adoption. I personally don't take on business I can't handle, but that's just me.

Once again, what is good for the goose is good for the gander. This battle is independent of bitcoins as all the players do tax planning and take billions away from your government earnings. Sure, the patriotic few can pay taxes but those who can save $10 k - $1,000 k should be allowed to. If is fair, legal and the norm then why not? 
@_date: 2013-12-14 10:35:33

It really depends on the taxes of your country. I would say that anything above 10k would be worth it but once again it depends on your taxes you would have to pay, the period of time you wish to remain in bitcoin investing and the amount of money you wish to continue investing. Its really based on an individual level.

Year after year and bubble after bubble I deal with the waves of nay-sayers. I don't rub it in their face but instead I get them to buy or accept bitcoins and the results are pretty good.

You do know bitcoins and the miners work with a level of democratic resolution.  The miners need to come to a fair concensus on which fork of the bitcoin software they will use. I am sorry, but I think you are in the wrong place.

I could do that for any crytocurrency getting pumped, thanks for the suggestion. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:58:11
I refuse to bribe anyone. If you are too narrow minded to see the potential crytocurrencies have for your market then its your loss. I'm there to help them move forward and I shouldn't have to pay them to do their job.

Not initially.

Bitcoins have as much a chance of becoming a legitimate currency as it does of failing. I believe in open source and as a community we can resolve issues as they come. Relax.

Hey. Spend a little money and get a 7950 for the least. You can get 600 khs tweaked. It will help until asics spool up.

No way! I used a country that has a non-corrupt government and stability.

I just read through the efficiency on the wiki - bitcoins can (if uncapped) handle up to 8000 transactions per second. However, down the road you might see new algorithms introduced into the architecture for a more energy efficient output - looking at various models like ppcoin's proof-of-stake or Satoshi's purge. I will be reading the forums daily and helping where I can, that's for sure. The devil's advocate scenario however is will we actually find an efficient manner, will the community want to adopt to these methods and will they prove long-term viable? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:58:47
That is not the solution. Eventually MtGox will get there act together or a new competition will win. For right now, who is the better alternative that has the fairest rates and the best reputation? BitStamp?
@_date: 2013-05-26 21:39:27
Good idea!

Hello. I am willing to pay a negotiated fee right now for your code and any documentation with regards to security protocols, business sequence diagrams, process operations, hardware requirements and anything else relevant to an exchange setup. Also willing to purchase with agreement for limited license capabilities with recurring yearly fees. 
Great idea we2code! I hope bitfloor considers a this as a viable and massive market to excel. 
@_date: 2013-05-07 13:08:33
Am I seeing right? Is that a total pool BTC output of 400+ per day?
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:18:39
I completely agree. I truly believe bitcoin is the solution we needed for our world. My wager is nothing more than confidence in humanity and the power of the 99% ... that is if people would wise up.

I would call it a educated bet based on trends and history.  BTC is already testing $750 as I type this based on mtgox.

Wasn't trying to prove a bullish/bearish point. I was just thinking about the events that took place to lead me to this point... and no I don't care to prove it at the moment - I'm super busy and don't care enough. I hope you can understand Mr.Internet Person. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:02:18
Not sure why you are being down voted.  You are absolutely correct and an offline wallet is the most secure method for your own personal security.  I do store coins on online services ranging from btce, mtgox, coinbase,  bter, cryptsy but the majority of my coins are backed up and offline. Coinkite I have never tried personally but will be giving them a little test soon based on recent news about them being reputable. Also, don't keep all your eggs in one basket.

I don't want to say which island refused yet, we are working with them. The state of bitcoins is very low in Barbados because of education but I have been trying for 3 years on local television,  newspaper and radio as I often am asked to consult on technology.  There was not much happening until a recording of me speaking about bitcoins at the annual conference for the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Barbados went viral. Now Barbadians are interested and my phone won't stop ringing. Literally.

Your advice is "don't vote"? Sounds like a solid democratic system you have going in your end. Good luck.

$36,000 - $108,000 per bitcoin. Id be more than happy.

Stop trying to play the market, there are smarter systems out there that look for guys like you and are designed to play the market with higher accuracy than you can output. Buy, hold and or use them for purchases as needed.

Next election is 4 years away but the opposition has filed a no-confidence motion in response to recent economic events with our country and there is an extremely high probability they will be successful. 
  
The exchange will be open in the second quarter of 2014.

That is not the *whole* point of bitcoin at all. Involving the government to get sanctions to legally transact bitcoin is far superior than operating a grassroot under the table operation. I am sorry but anyone that thinks that bitcoins should sit in the dark shadows of the internet and not get government recognition and acceptance is robbing bitcoin of its true potential.

Horrible experience with coinbase. I bought a few coins at $65 and didn't get them. I got my money back, but bitcoins went up to $120 by then! Will not use their slow, inefficient system again

Can you email someone from ICAB.bb and ask them for the audio capture from the Annual conference where a speaker presented bitcoins. I have asked for it, but no luck as yet.

Great job. I could definitely hire some tallent using bitcoins! I wonder if I could offer a design contest and reward winners using the BTC tipbot.... the tips will range on submission but I think its a great way to jump start the community. Everyone gets a taste of a few bucks, designers grow their portfolio and clients get more creativity.
