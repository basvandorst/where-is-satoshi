Apple is a real company that generates billions in profits every year. They have staff, infrastructure, patents and a brand that is very valuable. Their stock price is predicated on these factors as well as others such as sentiment. Its price is not speculation. Whether a stock is over or undervalued can be calculated and by purchasing multiple stocks across multiple sectors as well as bonds, REITS and preferred shares, you can be diversified. Bitcoin does not make money. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value since you can just make other cryptos. The blockchain is valuable, but you are not buying the blockchain via BTC. It is speculation. The price is going up because people are buying in due to the price going up. Simple as that. 
Cryptos serve a purpose and perhaps one day will change the world. BTC may or may not be there, no way of knowing. Enjoy the ride, but don't invest money you cannot afford to lose. That is simply irresponsible.

I was just giving an example of bubble behaviour in the space. I have said multiple times I have no idea where the price will go or where BTC will eventually end up but there is a lot of blind faith out there which is scary. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:18:53
This is a ridiculous argument. Gambling and investing are not the same thing. If I look at Apple who makes billions of dollars per year, owns thousands of very useful patents and has one of the most valuable brands in the world, that is not gambling, it is investing. If you purchase an ETF that tracks the SP500 and plan to hold for 20+ years, that is not really gambling, that is investing. If you purchase a digital token that has very little in the way of utility and can be easily replaced, in the hope it goes up in value, that is gambling. Purchasing BTC is in no way investing in the underlying technology. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:33:15
No need to be defensive, we are just having a discussion. You also provided no points, just compared BTC to FB without saying why they are the same but I'll help you see why they are not.
BTC's innovation at this point is limited as a currency as it does not solve any existing problems for the exception of laundering money. The exchanges also work off chain which if you cannot see the problem with that you have no business being in BTC. BTC on the other hand is not regulated, the exchanges are susceptible to hacks. yes you should put your money in a wallet but most new players drawn in by FOMO don't know that.
Buying bitcoin is completely different from FB. Have you ever read a financial statement in your life? FB had $27 BILLION in revenue in 2016, billions of users on virtually every smart phone and is well established. Purchasing a share in FB is purchasing a share in that revenue stream as well as their patents and HUGE market share (they own insta etc.), future growth etc. FB will not go to $0 (not saying BTC will but it is possible it can). FB is also on a regulated exchange and adheres to the required regulation therefor protecting investors. 
As I've said before, I believe in cryptos and the technology but remain critical and try to remain objective. 
If you're going to make a point at least make some sort of argument.

You have to look at BTC critically whether you are bullish/bearish. The argument that it is a bubble is compelling. I work for a FI and an elderly gentleman with little to no investment knowledge asked me if I can sell him Bitcoin. This scared me. Goes to show there are people looking to buy with no actual knowledge with regards to the technology or it's utility. They want to buy because their friend/family member/news outlet said it's going up. That is typical for a bubble. 
Saying "Who needs critical and rational thinking when there's pattern matching....." is simply hoping for the best and ironically, not being critical.

"only because the Fed has pumped billions of dollars into assets."
It is more so because new distruptive companies are making money hand over first which benefits shareholders (FAANG). The globalized economy has accelerated growth and access to goods and services which overall, is good for everyone including consumers and shareholders.
People investing money is a good thing. It puts money in the economy which creates profits. Incentive for these profits creates new beneficial technology which is a good thing for everyone. It is not a coercive force to spend. It is a coercive force to invest in the economy.
Debt is not inherently slavery. If I have $20k and I need a car, it makes far more sense to take out a low interest loan and invest the 20k in a tax sheltered account then to purchase a depreciating asset with the cash. Depending on interest rates, debt can make a lot of sense.

But flows into  ETFs do not inflate or deflate prices any more than mutual fund flows or the collective purchases of individual investors into stocks like Apple or Facebook.  ETFs reflect the valuation of the underlying securities they are composed of, which is driven by the collective sentiment of all market participants. 
So I respectively disagree.

I don't know the amount I was using it as an example. There are plenty of other things... transit, sewers,  etc. The biggest expense is benefits for the elderly. Should we just leave them on the street? Just a few examples. This is not me advocating bloated government or anything, simply outlining that some taxes are justified.
Your answer about schooling is a cop out. Loans are not "pushed". I was never offered a loan when I went to school as I decided I wanted to come out of it debt free. No one was trying to push me to get a loan so that's BS. I have never seen/heard a commercial for student loans. Plenty of people on my campus were drinking Starbucks and partying 3-4 nights a week. That's their choice and do not complain about student loans after the fact. Hopefully they got decent jobs. It is that kind of keeping up with the Jones's that handcuffs people, not taxes.
Our top MTR is over 50% here in Canada which is ridiculous. I would be happy with a low flat tax of say 10% and a tax on non-essential consumption i.e don't tax food but tax all non-essentials.
So is crypto a medium of exchange or a storage of wealth? If everything went haywire and they system collapsed would you rather a few bitcoins or ammo and food?
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:52:50
Roads need to be maintained for obvious reasons, university is optional, student loans are a choice. Work full time in the summer and part time during school and you can come out with very little debt in Canada. I never claimed the Government is a benevolent entity that only looks after our best interest. They do however provide services that most people could not afford on their own ie healthcare and infrastructure that allows you to shit down a hole in your house and have water delivered to your taps. Also why do you care about the value of your crypto against fiat if you plan to hold forever. Caring about the value implies you look to cash in eventually. Hypocritical.

You are free to homeschool all you want though. Most things covered before University have nothing to do with getting a job.When you go to University you choose what you study. If you want to take women's studies and not work you are free to do so. 
People do not want to be sick or dying because it is not pleasant. Free healthcare costs the Government money, it does not make them money. We simply socialize the cost of healthcare which is by far the best way of doing it. They save people with critical illnesses and disabilities who will not contribute taxes but rather receive benefits so your argument makes no sense.

And traditionally it has always been the other way around. What's your point? If your point is that there is no such thing that goes up forever without any kinds of corrections then sure you are correct. What a dumb post.

The risk is that BTC can go to $0 if it does not become a currency. You do not have this risk with a diversified portfolio. If all bonds, preferred shares, stocks and currency went to $0, having BTC would not save you. Canned food and ammo would be a better bet.
@_date: 2018-06-19 22:56:03
Let's go back to OP's example where they used index funds. An index fund invests in hundreds of stocks. These stocks have to be a certain size before being listed on a big exchange so it is not like you are buying some random overly leveraged mining company. 
Of course there are risks. Companies go belly up every day. But large cap stocks produce shareholder value such as profits, dividends, goods, jobs, new technology and cash flow. They produce VALUE. Sentiment can drive the value of stocks down as well as up. You can generally calculate the FMV of a company. 
The largest companies by market cap are Apple and Amazon. If the US markets crashed, these stocks would be impacted bigly as index funds sell off. This does not mean Amazon will stop being a money machine. This does not mean they will go bankrupt. They will recover when sentiment reverses because they have underlying value. They hold assets. 
Most people do no "speculate in stocks". Most people hold mutual funds and ETF's that are well diversified and can weather down turns. With regards to retirement accounts (RRSP, TFSA, RESP etc here in Canada... 401k in USA) they offer tax relief. BTC cannot do that. One of your points is that BTC is a hedge against market volatility. This is not true. 
BTC's only possibility of survival is adoption because it produces nothing. What will we use BTC for if it is not adopted as a currency? Nothing. It will be a useless digital token. A novelty. Investing in BTC is speculating it will be adopted. It may be, it may not be. It is gambling.

The greatest buying binge almost always happens at the top – peak price and peak demand. The smart money exits as the dumbass money flows in. Values may fall sharply, at which point promoters scream ‘buying opportunity’ But, it's a trap.
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:33:37
Of course other assets can go down. The difference is there is usually something of value that prevents them from going to zero (nothing however can stop bad management) such as assets, cash flow, patents... whatever.
The market is cyclical but there has never, since the inception of the stock market, been a 10 year period of negative returns. If you invested the day before the great depression started you would be even or ahead within 10 years. The reason for this is just because companies, stocks etc go down in value, it does not mean the suddenly stop making money, or stop creating jobs or stop creating something of use. A lot of it is driven on sentiment. If markets were not bailed out in 2008 it would have burned, but it would eventually recover.
If Amazon crashed, that would hurt because of its market cap. Amazon crashing would not stop it from being a money printing machine and it would recover once sentiment changes.

I just don't buy some of the arguments for it.. the same way some arguments against it are silly. I think it will serve a purpose but I do not think it will replace fiat.. at least not in my lifetime.
If anything I see it replacing gold as a safe haven investment. Even if BTC is adopted, 1% of people would own most of it and we would have the same problem.

I thought Goldman purchased Poloniex outright for $400M...even though it processes nothing as of now? Goldman wanted to set up a trading desk for crypto but the market is relatively illiquid and they owned no crypto, hence the purchase. Poloniex only reports profits in crypto which will allow Goldman to build an inventory of crypto and sell it to their clients at a profit.
Does any of this sound familiar ala MBS/CDS's? Should be interesting.
Also Poloniex was associated with Bitconnect I believe. This whole thing does not pass the sniff test.

Government debt has no term or amortization. If the debt is being used to create value, increase the standard of living, create infrastructure or provide free health care (Canadian here), they can hypothetically, take 1000 years to pay it off. Also, the interest rate they pay is miniscule due to their ability to tax, generate revenue and credit rating.
Expansion often requires debt. Using leverage to invest can sometimes make sense for example (usually for tax reasons). Debt when used responsibly can create a lot of wealth. There is no company out there without debt.
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:49:16
The main difference is that there is an underlying, tangible piece of value in a stock. The stock market is not largely based on speculation although of course there is some (shortvol a recent example). A sophisticated investor can build a portfolio and know the exact amount of risk (it's measurable) that they are taking to make "x" return and see if it is worth the risk. There are also things like ETF's that allow you to hold hundreds of companies through one security so you are diversified. 
There is speculation in the stock market sure, but there is a lot of passive investing where people are just looking for modest returns to beat inflation and save for retirement which expsosure to the markets up to your risk tolerance, then balanced out with less volatile investments, can offer. This is based on a large sample size as well.

@_date: 2018-02-13 19:45:52
I get your point and understand inflation risk, interest rate risk, currency risk etc. I know there are different types of risk other then just volatility.
BTC has not really been truly tested in a recession. By truly tested, I mean tested during a time where it is more widely adopted and known such as it is today. To say it will perform the best in that kind of environment is just speculation. Gold has been battle tested and performed very well during the credit crisis. I assume money would once again go there.
Time will tell I suppose.

There also value being created. The companies that make up an index have tangible metrics that can be used to determine their value. Companies are making a lot of money and with the tax cuts, will likely make more. The recent sell off is completely normal. The market is over valued and the quick increase in yields caused a sell off. This is normal. The fundamentals are still in line and companies are making money. QE is being wound down which will have its growing pains.
The BTC run up was FOMO. People saw it as a way to get rich and put their money in it. A small % of BTC holders are invested for the altruistic reasons of "sticking it to the man." It is mostly people looking to get rich otherwise, why care about the price at all?
I put a little in just in case the hodlers are right.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:48:02
The main problem that I see is it may give certain people and unrealistic expectation with regards to their investment returns. It may make people participate in riskier investments without fully understanding the risks in hope of maintaining these returns. When you make 1000%, 10% starts looking boring when in reality, if you can average 10%/year over your lifetime, you are doing very well!

Just saying "wrong" isn't helping anyone. Try to explain yourself and educate people who may disagree...
- You will find there is no mass adoption as nowhere will be incentivised to accept it.
- Jobs are a result of economic activity. If there is no economic activity, there are no jobs. Economic activity is created through trading labour for money/gold/btc whatever. If everyone is hoarding this wealth is not created.
- Innovation is done as there is a monetary incentive. It also requires funding. If everyone hoards there money, that incentive and funding is not there.
- Law enforcement is unfortunately necessary since people do bad things. You say it is a great feature until you need police. If you've never experienced that kind of situation, consider yourself fortunate.
- People can pay for things if they value them sure. People do it every day. We all value roads. We all value hospitals. These things are made possible through economic activity.
- No savings equilibrium will ever happen with BTC. BTC has the same problem as fiat... top 1% hold the majority.
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:48:54
No ztsmart, you are wrong. Currency is for spending and economic development/activity. You use currency to build things, buy things and to invest. I exchange my currency for a stock, I hold the stock, not the currency. 
I give person currency in exchange for a sandwich. They take said currency, and use it to purchase more toppings and to spend in the economy so on and so forth. If no one buys anything and instead hoards, what do you think happens? Bad things happen. No more jobs, no more innovation, no more law enforcement since there is not tax being collected. no more infrastructure, no more health care etc.
Everyone hoarding currency is the worst possible thing that can happen. You have literally no clue what you are talking about.

What would trigger the gains in crypto? People hoard cash in recessions or go to fixed income.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:54:01
The main problem is that BTC, as it stands requires a large amount of risk tolerance. In a hypothetical crash, people want to hoard their money and store it somewhere safe. Their risk tolerances decrease as economic conditions worsen (job losses, wage decrease etc.). My point is that as people's risk tolerances decrease, they will not want to stash their money in a super volatile digital coin. They will hoard their cash, get GIC's etc.

I disagreed with this:
"They also have FUD, FOMO, etc. The stock prices are largely based on speculation and not the true value of the stock, which is why the stock market experiences 'crashes', 'corrections', etc just like crypto. "
I disagree that valuations are based LARGELY on speculation and I disagree that crypto crashes and market crashes are the same. They are not. But yes I agree that there was some FOMO that is being corrected. Sorry, maybe I read something else and responded to the wrong post.

Yes it has corrected to levels it was at 3 weeks ago. There are also tangible reasons such as a sharp rise in US 10y treasuries and some disappointing earnings. There is also pension rebalancing among other reasons. A 5%-10% correction after this kind of run up is completely healthy and expected.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:54:00
Look at the drop by percentage not by points. It gives you a better idea as to how much value the index lost.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:17:08
How am I full of shit?
Yes there is froth in the market and that is being corrected as yields on treasuries are increasing too quickly. This creates inflation, which creates higher wages and higher costs of borrowing on a companies debt. This also means investors can now get better yield from safer investments so they sell stocks. Also the recent blow out of XIV is having spillover effects. Volatility is high right now but there is nothing unusual happening.  You can always just index if you do not want to purchase individual stocks or you do not have enough money to properly diversify.
Can you show me how you determined the value of "stocks" and how they are overpriced? P/E's are high but the tax changes could change that unless rates continue to rise.
No there is no EXACT measurement of risk but here are some ratios that are used to determine risks to get you started:
Is there froth in BTC or is it undervalued? My point is you can't say. 
Sorry you don't like people that have different opinions then you :( That's a pretty shitty trait. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:52:52
Biggest POINT drop in history, not biggest drop by percentage. All in all it is a 5% pullback from the ATH which is completely normal. The S&amp;P was on its longest streak without a 5% since its inception. A 60%-70% would not be normal. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:39:06
It's possible. Both fiat and btc have bad properties though. Purchasing btc is cumbersome and the transacting still needs work. Both values are influenced differently etc.    My concern with btc in a crisis is the risk appetite currently required yo hold bitcoin. I can see it taking some of golds market share but it has to be less volatile to serve that purpose.

Banks lend out deposits. Deposits are insured. Banks will bundle mortgages and loans together into debt instruments, sell them and have more money to lend. They also have mortgages in a securitized pool to raise money to lend. Banks can also borrow money.
Banks act as facilitators between buyers and sellers. 
If I want to buy a house, the seller does not want to receive payments over a 25 year period. The bank however is well capitalized and will do this, but will want interest. Money is not created out of nothing in the form of a mortgage, it is the intermediary of a transaction.
Saying banks make money out of nothing is simply wrong.

Regardless of the currency people will have to borrow it. Right now individuals can lend out FIAT at an interest rate they deem appropriate but they don't because of the risk. BTC will not solve this problem. I think banks or a version of them will still act is intermediaries in these types of transactions because people will not want to lend out their BTC, especially if it is hard to track.
Also, some amount of regulation is not a bad thing as it can help prevent theft of people's BTC or prevent people from investing their BTC in scams (Ponzi's for example).

It is their business to control/mitigate the risk of the bank. Having a bank with proper risk controls in place is good for everyone otherwise, you get a Lehman situation.

This is just the facts, take it or leave it.

CAD banks are insured by CDIC up to $100k. Some credit unions are 100% insured and a lot charge no fees. You can still find HISA's as well so you can earn some interest. 
If someone told you to hold 20% in cash they have no idea what they are talking about. You should hold around 5% in cash. Having 20% cash is a HUGE opportunity cost and is just poor advice. I work in banking and have never in my life heard someone recommend 20% cash. Your better off in a redeemable GIC or a money market fund. That is terrible, terrible advice.

I work at a bank and we lend every day. Just harder to qualify. Most mortgages at the bank are insured by CMHC which as enough liquidity to insure the banks are made whole in a worst case scenario. If they're not insured the LTV is low enough to mitigate the risk in most situations. B20 is also restricting new.mortgages to those that can actually afford it. The hotter markets are cooling off as we speak. The housing bubble in Canada is more or less in the GTA and YVR. The East coast, Montreal, Ottawa and the prairies are actually quite reasonable. Real estate markets are localized. They're also not the only bank... Most credit unions are also restricting crypto purchases. As I said before it is due to very strict AML and FINTRAC reporting in Canada. This is a fact I'm not speculating as I've asked people involved in it. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:29:25

Serious question. If you bought BTC for the altruistic reasons that people talk about (an FU to the system, deflation, savings equilibrium etc) then why does the price of 1 btc converted to USD matter? If you care about the price, it implies you are waiting for a gain to convert it back to FIAT which defeats the purpose.
Honest question.

Bitcoin will remain flat as the fad is waning. When maximum supply is reached, miners cannot get any more rewards for mining Bitcoin and thus have to rely on transaction fees to make a profit.
