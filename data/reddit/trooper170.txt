I got the same mail. Is it legit?

So I take it that it's worth upgrading to the 28nm regardless of further wait time? lol,
I'm having to balance my worry of power cost with worry of sitting in an endless line and never getting a useful product soon enough. :/

I've had 2 small 5GH/s BFL devices ordered since May of this year for my birthday. I probably won't see them until my next birthday. xD I expected a minimum of 6 month delay because the product was still in testing / manufacture when I ordered.. but still. That's 500$ on 2 devices that will probably be worth 100 each when I get them. lol, if gfx card market prices can be carried over at all to this. xP at least I know they'll pay for themselves eventually, even if the difficulty does go up. (using the word 'eventually' very loosely. ;P)
edit** I was browsing their forums, and in an interesting new development; I can now transfer and/or sell my order / place in line to another person if I wanted to. xD

Hopefully not for 3-4 years. :P and I'm not terribly worried about the power consumption as it's an ASIC device which uses relatively little power (one of the reasons I waited this long), and as long as power costs remain relatively constant the next several years, It should still turn out profit. Perhaps I'll transfer my 2 5GH/s device orders to someone for ~500$. Lol, then they can have my spot in line. But I think I can wait a while longer, the forums seem to think they'll be caught up on most of the backlog for my devices by the time October rolls around.. So that probably means I'll see mine sometime First Quarter of next year. xP Wouldn't want to jump ship only 4-8 months before things start moving my direction, now would I? Of course I could start waiting in line somewhere else... but lines are lines. Also now they're offering me the chance to transfer to 28nm Mining Cards ~~for only a 10% transfer fee. xD So I only have to give them 58.20$ more to get 28nm devices instead~~, if I so choose; but of course that would PROBABLY put me even further back in the line. xD so I may be better off just getting the 65nm devices asap and plugging them in. lol, extract myself from this circle jerk as quickly as possible. (Disclaimer: As of yet, I have done ~~no~~ little research on the transfer/upgrade details; for all I know, they may still honor my original place in line, though I doubt it, considering I would be receiving a different product with different manufacturing criteria/times.) It would seem as though BFL is struggling to keep up with the times as hardware is changing so quickly, and they can only produce so much so quickly before they're forced to redesign and re-specialize to keep up with the market. This is all mere speculation mind you, and as such has little factual value. Perhaps someone can do the math and tell me if ~~spending 58$ extra and~~ waiting another 6-8 months is worth getting 28nm over 65nm devices. lol
****Edit**** "For orders originally placed April 1, 2013 or before, there is 0% transfer fee to transfer your order to the new 28nm Bitcoin Mining cards." I cleared the transfer fee deadline by a month.. lol, so no extra cost. Now I'm just left wondering if it's worth an extra 6-8 months of possible wait for 28nm mining cards before I commit to a transfer..

I wish I had been one of the early adopters :P I might already have my jalapeno by now.
