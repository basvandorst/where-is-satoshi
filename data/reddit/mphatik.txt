I learned nothing from his interview, except he's trash talking something he knows nothing about.
"uhhh", "errr", "ummm".

America is war drunk.  We need it to survive, without invasions the economy is going upside down.  
Someone warned us of this after WW2, Dwight D. Eisenhower.

They help, especially after you decimate a country and turn around and sell contracts to help rebuild them.

I came back to Coinbase after a 4-year hiatus and forgetting all about my coins.  
I used Authy and was able to gain access almost immediately.  Cashed out about 7-coins and I've since then transferred my coin to a hard wallet.

Makes sense with the comparisons the media was making about how illegal Silk Road was and the ability to use crypto currencies to purchase things anonymously. 
It would appear the instructor has been eating from the medias spoon.

I bought one back during the crash to $350, I bought 6 when it jumped to $450.  My mentality has been to forget about it the whole time.  
Now I'm 7.2 btc in and I'm still forgetting about it, although it's tough to not look at the rise.

Same here, just tried and it's giving me an error.  Should clear up hopefully soon.

Well this should help gain confidence on some of the borderline investors.

The day traders are the ones committing suicide, if you trust and believe in bitcoin, you got nothing to worry about.  If you're banking on becoming a millionaire overnight, you could be in for a rude awakening. 
I bought in around $200, a good amount and I've just been sitting back.  Sure it spiked to $1100, now it's $600, but I use bitcoin for small purchases and I still have a good amount of coin left.  
Bottom line?  I just forget about them and go on with my daily life, maybe I'll cash out one day, but not yet.....

I've just invested in the first time folks!  .5 Bitcoin and $200 poorer.  :P  
I've been reading from the side lines this whole time, tried setting up a miner last year, with no success.  I'm now here with the rest of the community, helping it grow!
