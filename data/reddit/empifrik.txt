Percentage-wise, dogecoin adoption is INCREDIBLE. It is something we have never seen in any crypto, ever.
Guys, stop trying to down-play dogecoin just because you don't like it. You sound like old guys on TV when they talk about bitcoin:
"No one accepts it!"
"It's a fad"
"It will be gone once the bubble pops!"
Dogecoin is inviting, educational, fun, easy to try out, it's everything that bitcoin is unable to do for the average person. And WE NEED average people.

This will be confusing.
Wallet is a bad name for what it actually is. A better name would be a keychain. You never actually "own" the bitcoins, and they are never actually "in" the wallet. What you have is a key that has control over them, and by being the only person to control them, in practice you kinda own them.
So what a backup does is - it backs up your key. Like making another key for your home in case you lose your first key. But if you give your key to your neighbor, he can enter your house or, in our case, take your bitcoin. That's why it's called a **private** key.
Luckily, there is a process called encryption, where you take the bitcoin key and encrypt it with a password and then store it somewhere, so when you lose your primary key, you take your backup key, decrypt it with that same password (which you HAVE TO REMEMBER - there is no "forgot password" button :) ), and then you have your key again.

Click donate, wait for new tab to load, type email and password, click Login, wait for site to load, click Pay, wait for it to load, get a confirmation email, delete email.

The thing people seem to forget that we are still underdogs. Some of the hardcore bitcoiners may hate dogecoin, and vice versa, but it doesn't matter. The point is, 50k people like dogecoin. That's 50k people to promote and use cryptocurrency, and if it started as a joke, so what?
People are loving it, they are doing good for all cryptos and having fun at the same time.
Hate between Doge and BTC subreddits makes no sense, because we have the same goal, the only difference is the method we use. Of course, yelling "to the moon" and "wow such currency" may not help some communities directly, but it motivates people to continue developing services and to continue to spread the idea of cryptos around the world. If it's fun to do something, you will do it more than if it wasn't, and everyone benefits from that.

What most people actually mean when they say "X number of people own Y percent of BTC" is "X amount of wallets own Y percent of BTC". That's a huge difference, because most exchanges and other services use 1 large wallet to keep funds for thousands of people. So it's hard to say what the actual spread is like. Not to mention a bunch of lost wallets with 10k or more coins from when BTC was worthless and people formatted their drive or just lost the wallet.

The fact you can sell someone your BTC for USD means BTC is worth money.
