This is false/inaccurate information as well. There is no possession of stolen credit card numbers, concealing evidence, or threatening a federal agent charge (all of which would be different statutes). The specific counts are:
18 U.S.C. § 875(c) — Transmitting a Threat in Interstate Commerce
18 U.S.C. § 3 (§§ 1030(a)(5)(B) and 1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(I)) — Accessory After the Fact in the Unauthorized Access to a Protected Computer
18 U.S.C. §§ 1501 &amp; 2 — Interference with the Execution of a Search Warrant

sorry, but this is ridiculous.
your "solution" is not comprehensive at all. and Dropbox, really? that's a questionable third party with employees who can readily view your data.
people using Bitcoin already have plenty of means and knowledge to keep their SSH keys secure. 
Slush and Bitcoinica did not "give up" responsibility for securing their own servers, in fact they did everything they possibly could in order to do so, only to see that effort go to waste because of a vulnerability at Linode. you are trolling sir.

Until he's convicted by a jury, it's allegedly as far as I'm concerned. As bystanders we're not placed to say whether what he did constitutes a threat according to the letter of the law. 
It's very complex and nuanced. He qualifies his statements with "but that doesn't mean I'm gonna go kill him" and clarifies that he intends to investigate and gather info about the agent. Then he says that he'll assume FBI are Zeta assassin squads and exercise self-defense. In order to understand all that and what he's thinking you have to get into OpCartel and Team Themis. It's hard for the average person to understand.
I don't think that the video is enough to say that he is guilty of threatening the agent. You need a courtroom in which evidence is presented and challenged by both sides to do that.
Agree with the rest of what you said.

No. This one's a different source. I deleted the other post, this one is replacing it.
@_date: 2013-09-16 19:09:45
Not correct either. The links were already out there and being shared by people on Twitter, and in Pastebins put out by the hackers. The indictment says the link was copied from one channel ( -- you could say that hackers were in there, but it's not really close-knit, the close-knit group would be AntiSec and Hammond/Sabu) to another,  (not an IRC channel of hackers at all, instead a channel full of surveillance state researchers). I wouldn't say he was the first to post the link. He's just the only to face charges for it.
@_date: 2013-07-31 15:41:08
The most he could get is 6 months on the threat. It's nothing. The vast bulk of the time he is facing has to do with the second indictment. 
@_date: 2013-09-13 19:52:57
You're wrong on a few things, because you haven't looked deeply enough. Your comments might apply to the first indictment - the threats charges - but there are two other indictments, and those are directly related to his work as a journalist.
Have you heard of Project PM and the work they did digging into leaked e-mails to investigate the cyber-intelligence industry? With Project PM Barrett wrote a report on a surveillance capability called Romas/COIN that got picked up by other outlets. It's a legitimate journalistic enterprise with several other researchers and members from the journalism field, including at one point Michael Roston and Michael Hastings.
When Stratfor got hacked, he posted the link from one chatroom into the Project PM chat (his "editorial board"). The link itself is not just credit card data, its also a list of clients and subscribers. It has journalistic import insofaras it demonstrates how well-connected Stratfor is and who is paying to receive their intelligence.
The idea that he posted the link out of negligence and revenge is ridiculous. He wanted his fellow researchers in the chatroom to look at the data in a journalistic capacity.
Furthermore, Barrett Brown is on the record in several places as being opposed to the release of raw, sensitive data by hackers, including credit cards. He viewed such things as pointless and harmful to innocents and was openly critical of such motives. See Pastebin "On Stratfor".
With regard to hiding his laptops which is another indictment, there's no doubt in my mind that he was protecting his sources. Those laptops had notes for a book-in-progress, and all of his work on it. It's understandable he wouldn't want to share it with the feds.
If he did any of these things in "self-interest" then his interests were defending his mother and exposing the surveillance state.
I recommend you read The Nation article, The Strange Case of Barrett Brown.  You'll get a much clearer and nuanced picture than the superficial conclusion you've come to.

I'm kind of annoyed that this post on The Hacker News quoted and borrowed liberally from an article I wrote but didn't credit. There's one link back to it but it's tiny.
 What do the latest NSA leaks mean for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-09-12 12:05:39
Allegedly he did. The coverage of his case discusses that. He was pissed that the FBI was threatening his mother with charges. It's fair to mention but I think you will find that it's not as significant from an internet and press freedom standpoint, and it doesn't account for the majority of the time he's facing.
