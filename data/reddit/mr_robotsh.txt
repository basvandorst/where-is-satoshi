you don't understand. It will be big news when Satoshi's coins are touched (probably causing the price to drop) and then the Bitcoin community will be watching very closely where those coins go and even the tumble owners (you can't trust anyone bc they'll be hunting him down)

Yeh I think that's it. I haven't checked my wallet in a while cos I bought years ago when Bitcoin was the hype. I might check my emails though cos I forgot all my credentials it was years ago. They will probably be worth a lot now but I'm holding them for a long term gain (generations)

I'm surprised Satoshi, with all his brilliance, did not consider how early miners would completely monopolise to the point where the entry barriers are so high a few people are going to own the rest of those coins
@_date: 2017-01-01 03:57:42
Even cash sellers on local bitcoins will have personal info on you (your phone number, physical appearance). Can you really trust the bitcoin tumblers to not log stuff especially if they want to know who Satoshi is (as most of the bitcoin community does or so I think)? Even if he doesn't exchange for fiat, when he buys a service using an address that is linked to him how can he trust vendors or even just the bitcoin tumblers. He will have to think it through very strategically if he is to stand a chance against the Bitcoin community
@_date: 2017-01-01 00:16:27
As many on this thread have pointed out, this doesn't make him smart because many others had also predicted Bitcoin technology and more accurately than this. I shared it because I'm a fan of Milton Friedman and his economic brilliance gives credit to the potential of Bitcoin technology. If he saw something like this being so fundamental, then I can have more confidence in this project as an investor. Honestly, if Milton Friedman thought this could change the world of transactions when the internet was only just blossoming, he was on to something. I'm tempted to buy some more btc after just seeing Milton Friedman endorse it

mass adoption won't happen, I agree. But that doesn't mean BTC won't still have demand from international transfers and black market laundering. That is still a huge market worth 10s of billions of dollars

Well the cash traders on LocalBitcoins aren't necessarily shady and do it as a full time job by taking profit on their extortionate margins you have to pay (which criminals are more than willing to pay if it means they can't be traced as easily).
There will be some though who are not professionals and are clearly doing something illegitimate. Just pick the traders with good volume and reputation on localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2017-01-02 03:23:07
because there aren't loads of sellers to buy these so the demand exceeds the supply, causing the price to increase and the volume to be low. If volume is high, there's a lot more liquidity. This bit of the graph is just as useful to understand as otherwise the price is just meaningless
@_date: 2017-01-02 11:11:19
Why would you even try to rub something like that in someone's face? I wasn't around the whole Bitcoin fad in 2013 so luckily never touched that dirty Karpeles retirement fund.

everything the slightest bit sceptical has to be dismissed by it's as if none of you are able to consider a different perspective. too many on here are lost into some stupid fantasy that Bitcoin will become the single world currency and they'll all be billionaires because they put their life savings into it. Not going to happen just like that. Bitcoin is a big fat experiment that could come tumbling down once people realise Bitcoin has become completely monopolised and can't scale anyway. Oh but you're one of the sacred 'early adopters' who will cash in their 10,000 bitcoins for $1million/btc. Give me a break you ancap tweakers

@_date: 2017-01-01 23:27:04

Not convinced. This doesn't have a direct impact on Bitcoin demand per se
@_date: 2017-01-03 15:48:12
If you follow the transactions, it appears Nick Szabo (Satoshi Nakamoto) is tumbling his coins so maybe he is trying to sell without trying to spook anyone.

ok we'll spare ether, monero and lite for a few months but cmon they're going to nothing eventually just like Dogecoin. I mean who even came up with that DOGE what a joke. A currency based on a dog's face how silly can't believe people wasted ASICs on those stupid things. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 09:50:21
Because people *believe* that if enough people jump on board, one day people will use it as a medium of exchange. This is all just a fad though because Bitcoin cannot scale and it takes hours to process a transaction. It also can't be used as a commodity because anyone can copy and paste the code. In fact, there are dozens of replicas that are just like Bitcoin. Such as [this]( one - it's just as good as Bitcoin the only difference is that Bitcoin was first but that still doesn't mean Bitcoin will hold its value because people could just switch to a better cryptocurrency as soon as it comes around. What a joke right? DOGecoin lol. This is how much of a joke Bitcoin is. So nothing really makes it unique or valuable only idiots who believe it can't be replaced. I heard somewhere that Satoshi was actually a Nigerian scam artist

they can't buy bitcoin if their money is gone. their income will have to be given in euro and the banks will re-open all bailed out and 'safe' again. Let's not get too optimistic that it blinds us from rationality. It's too late to buy at this price it's simply ridiculous. We need a correction from this speculation driven craziness. You coin collectors are off your heads. There are people saying oh $100,000/btc by end of 2017 $7500/btc by end of 2017... it's all a load of shit with no basis whatsoever.

You can set the fees to a Satoshi but they won't get accepted by the network, causing a DDOS essentially because you could flood enough of the network to get your botnet up to 51% from all the nodes shut down by the traffic overload. As in, if enough of the network was DDOSd then a small mining botnet could become the majority of active nodes. Hence, you could steal a lot of BTC

This pains me in all honestly. But basically you divide $25 dollars by the $300 dollars so that you can scale it by multiplying by the new price $1000. So if it was roughly $300 at the time it should be worth about $83.33

You only need to download the blockchain if you want to spend the Bitcoins. You can send bitcoin to the 'account name'/wallet address and just keep them in a safe location as an investment. Otherwise download bitcoin core  and run the program. If your computer is connected to the internet it will begin to download the entire current blockchain which is around 100GB now - this could take a long time

Unlikely. It basically is defined in the context of a finite field and uses an elliptic curve. A straight line is used because if it intersects 2 tangent points on the elliptic curve, it will intersect a third point. The private key is the point between 1 and 2^256. The base point is the line origin on the graph. The base point multiplied by the private key is equal to the public key. The Bitcoin wallet address is a hash of the public key. So it is very easy to define but almost impossible to brute force with current technology since 2^256 is almost the number of atoms in the universe. If you want to read more about the maths of it lookup ECDSA

well a central bank just sets the base rate and money supply. So there's no advantage in having friends at the Bank of England. There's a monetary policy committee who have to vote on changes (9 of them) and they have to maintain the band of 1-2% inflation annually. It is not a place to make slick deals and profit. So no.

Example 1 is a known conspiracy. Attributed to Senator John Sherman in a letter supposedly sent from the Rothschild Bros. of London to New York bankers Ikleheimer, Morton, and Vandergould, on 25 June 1863. The letters are forgeries that could not have been written before 1876. Further, no evidence of a firm with the name "Ikleheimer, Morton, and Vandergould" has been found.
Example 2 - yes, this is how QE works although it has it's economic benefits and disadvantages. there's nothing criminal about it. It is a method that you can debate 
Example 3 - it did need reform
Example 4 - Yeh, it's difficult to increase the money supply at the same rate as Real GDP... this was also over a long period of time. I haven't looked at the US figures but where were the interest rates? I'd have thought the net growth in wealth was positive from 1913. I am just guessing tho
Example 5 doesn't really make any sense because you're grouping retail and investment bankers with central bankers at the fed. They're not the same group of people, completely different interest and motivations. Would you rather people lose their homes? Or gov bails out your savings? I think I'd rather get my money back...
Example 6 - great. I agree mostly
How is Example 7 relevant
Example 8 is Illuminati conspiracy theory hogwash so I can't be bothered to even watch it. You've lost a lot of credibility already
Example 9 - bad book keeping for the gov, is this at all surprising. no one should give a shit 
Example 10 is just another example of why the US and UK should stop giving aid through gov but also why we should stop all these bullshit charities. It goes straight to corrupt officials
Example 11 - great, more conspiracies. I can take you seriously now
Example 12 - not relevant tho
Example 13 - i'll watch it at some point
Example 14 - this is also not central bank related
Example 15 - yeh, again not even relevant

The 'banksters', or in this case the Central Banks, manipulate currency to protect or strengthen the economy - nothing else. It is their job to try and ensure the prosperity of their country. You make it sound evil and self-interested. 'slavery from the banksters' is a bit ridiculous. Again, you can only be referring to central bankers who are employed to adjust Monetary Policy accordingly to help the economy and thus its citizens. They don't have bad intentions, but you phrase it as if they do. 
Right now it is hard to live on bitcoin so I'm not sure how you are managing entirely without exchanging it from time to time. Gas and electricity bills are paid in BTC? Netflix? Car insurance?

My one concern is that even if you're right, and I think you are in that the EU is a project that has ostensibly failed (and thus the Euro has), then it is still not necessarily going to mean that the Italians, Portuguese etc. are going to suddenly become all tech savvy and download the blockchain. Most of them probably don't even know what Bitcoin is. Wall St still doesn't understand it. So they'll probably just suffer and those who can, will buy gold and the traditional stuff. 
I'm worried too much is being bought on speculation that Venezuela, India etc are all switching to Bitcoin for x, y and z reasons. When in reality, we don't have the evidence and too much of the buying is correlated with media coverage
EDIT: Venezuela is such a low tech country that they simply wouldn't engage in such large scale adoption (enough to justify the highs we're seeing). They don't have the education and skills to understand Bitcoin (they're a very poor country) which makes them more likely to be putting their money in more tangible assets like land or gold for protection against hyperinflation

You're too deep into it clearly. Bickering on this thread isn't going to help you. You should have diversified... even if you are long on it. 
Why bring up Bilderberg? I rather have that than Satoshi and the Winklevii in control. You need to accept that Bitcoin is not as perfect as you'd like it to be. The ownership share prevents it from ever becoming a widespread, global currency. It's all being held on speculation, not spent. We will have to move to Ethereum or Litecoin.
Decentralised currencies can't offer protection to the individual. You lose your private key and you're fucked. Central banks can print money to bail out banks and keep people from losing their homes. I'm no lefty or even a centrist, but I still find it astonishing that people genuinely believe Bitcoin WILL BE the currency of the future. No it won't. This will come to an end and we'll all look back on it thinking we were so stupid to invest so much into these crapcoins.

They only see it as a digital commodity correlated to gold. the Winklevii realise that they could drive a lot of investment into bitcoin if its status is enhanced by being accessible to commodity traders who don't know anything about computer science.

I have no doubt that Bitcoin will continue to grow. I was referring to 2017 and the unlikely event that a quarter of Italy's population would adopt btc if the banks do collapse. Given time, maybe, but a year is too ambitious. I'm long don't you worry. There's no need to get all defensive to people who disagree with you. You just sound like a whiney little bitchboy
