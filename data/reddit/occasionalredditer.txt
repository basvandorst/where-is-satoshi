Good observation. It seems, for the last three weeks, best to buy Wednesday (morning - midday) and sell Saturday (afternoon - night) US time. Starting from 10 Jan, it's like a weekly pattern repeating itself. But I guess the triangle is closing, or what?

I suppose bitcoin probably can continue to grow for a long while still, but I agree, the past can't predict the future. I just think it looks like these price peaks follow a similar pattern, and wonder if not December 17 was another one of those. If so, the overall trend will likely be slowly downward the next few months, but with large price swings around that trend.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:52:52
Interesting. Where can I read about it?
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:07:35
Some assets like real estate tend to just grow, and I believe BTC is among that class. Anyway, adoption is a long way from saturation.
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:47:58
I'm not an expert, but my opinion is that the price reached a saturation point Dec 17, and what we are seeing now is a downward trend which will continue for the next 2-6 months, then it will turn and start rising again, barring some major event like the Mt Gox scandal.

Bitcoin is like Stallone in the first half of Rocky III, lazy from to too much success. We are waiting for the turnaround.
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:11:24
I pointed out yesterday, last four weeks saw a pattern of lows mid-week (usually Wednesdays midday) and highs Saturday night, Sunday morning. The overall trend is still down, but the repeating pattern should help calm people's nerves. Yesterday's slump was exacerbated by the Tether news, but there would likely have been a mid-week slump anyway, so don't panic.
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:28:22
Is there any evidence of price manipulation by whales or otherwise? I mean solid proof? 
In the long term, I believe people can be confident that the value of BTC will continue to grow. It has never really imploded in the past. There were slumps, but it always recovered. People talk a lot about this or that incident, but even a major event like the Mt Gox scandal did not much disrupt the long term growth trend. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:24:45
Relax. This a repeating pattern, which I [predicted earlier today]( Price will peak Saturday evening / Sunday morning. In general, the downward trend will continue for weeks maybe more, but turn around as always.
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:53:13
Isn't it obvious what's happening? In a five year perspective, using a logarithmic scale, BTC has always sloped upward until a breaking point, then sloped downward for a few months, sometimes more, before sloping upward again. The two last breaking points were April and December in 2013. I believe we are there again now,  and the trend will be down but tending to slope upward, the turning point probably from two to six months away.

This is the best and most clear headed comment in a long time. I remember the previous "bubble" news stories (in 2013). Thank you for posting this.
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:18:53
Because it's what has happened in the past. I think the reason BTC keeps increasing in worth is limited supply combined with usefulness and broader adoption globally. In your analysis: What has changed in the last few months that fundamentally change these underlying factors indicating a halt in BTC's value increase?

As I pointed out yesterday, last four weeks a pattern has repeated itself, with lows mid-week (usually Wednesdays midday) and highs Saturday night, Sunday morning. The overall trend is still down, but the repeating pattern should help calm people down somewhat. This slump was exacerbated by the Tether news, but there would likely have been a mid-week slump anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:45:09
I'm listening, but I think it's premature to talk of a 'crash'. I would save that term for when or if we reach $1,000. Too many people crying wolf here, hopefully it won't go as the fairy tale. I think we're part of a historic shift more than a bubble, but there are elements of both. Enjoy the moment and don't invest more than you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:21:04
I'm talking about a parabola, a slightly U-shaped curve. All previous price peaks have been followed by a lull period shaped like that. See April 2013 and December 2013.
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:35:08
I think your facts are wrong. There have been many price spikes. In none of the cases did the price really deflate, and the overall trend has been an extraordinary increase in value. I invite you to explain what the driving factors are behind that growth in value, and to explain why there is any reason to believe that those factors have changed in the last few months. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:33:20
You come to r/Bitcoin in order to ask that question? Why don't you just read the FAQ and other reading material in the sidebar?

bitstamp's depth chart looking good today 
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:01:28
Looks like a quite sharp drop now. Think I'll wait and see. It's difficult to know when it has reached the bottom, but best to be sure before buying in.
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:27:41
What do you do if you sell, expecting a dip, but instead of a dip, the price goes up a lot, although indicators show a dip should occur soon?
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:27:58
When the drop started, I thought it would go much lower than the first drop level. I'm not shocked at all by what we are seeing now. For the time being. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:59:17
[Deep "ravine" in BTC price has historically signaled the beginning of the end of a slump.]( Some time (~ a week) after ravine, price has stabilized or turned upward.
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:47:25
It's been quiet recently, but this size and speed of price move is actually normal for BTC. The price moves like "continental plate shifts".
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:25:57
This is an interesting theory, but can we get some substantiation for it? Supporting or contrary evidence? Other perspectives?
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:30:26
As I said while a lot of people on this sub were fooling themselves with imagined magical powers ("buy the dip" etc), the overall trend is down and will continue to be down for 2 to 6 months (from Dec 27). I think the price will bottom out at around $4,000. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:44:12
bitcoincharts.com is down.
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:59:18
Hopefully the price will stabilize. For us HODLers what matters is the long term trend anyway. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:43:48
Do you still think there will be a dip now? I am reluctant to buy back in now, in case we will see a dip. Low volume price rise and doji are indicators that there might be a reversal or possibly sharp sell-off. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:14:09
And today's fall triggered by sell orders? Are bots running this show?
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:24:27
Well said. It's impossible to predict, but usually the price peaks on Saturdays. If it drops as far as $5,000 next week, it would be a great buying opportunity. Those who were smart enough to buy this week's dip have seen a ~30% rise in only a few days.
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:38:27
What's the current theory about what caused the $600 jump yesterday?
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:21:50
Care to elaborate why you think this is a pump?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:39:07
I think the rapid drop we are seeing today is a ... crevice? (What's the opposite of a spike?) Go back in time, look at the charts. Note also that the weekly pattern has held up. I actually sold some btc over the weekend because I knew that the price on Saturday night would be a peak, but I also hate to see that I was right because I am still mostly holding. I have no idea why there looks like a weekly cycle or something. Might just be coincidence, and probably related to the downward trend we are having.
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:15:16
That would be interesting, but nobody knows.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:05:17
Yes, it's going way. way too fast. Probably not a recovery, but it could signal a slowing down of the downtrend. In 2013, 2014, 2015, similar "ravines" signaled the "beginning of the end" of the slump. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:13:27
Amen2. I saw down and calculated what % I realistically could have made in this dip (considering the unlikelihood of guessing top and bottom right), and found it is comparable to what the daily growth rate has been after the "big dip" of 2/6. So what's the point in trading anyway? 
@_date: 2018-02-24 13:24:03
It looks like a lot of people are waiting for the pendulum to swing "up". When they feel confident, it will swing.
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:33:55
I'm not an expert, but I don't think anyone really knows what drives the price. Looking at a chart of BTC from the start (zooming out), there were these "ravines" after many of the dips in 2013, 2014 and 2015. And after the "ravine", it looks like the price kind of stabilized. A possible explanation is that the steep price rise today is caused by the BTC market running out of "panic sellers", thus signaling that the slump is grinding to a halt and the price is stabilizing. But how much is due to the Senate hearing, and other news? Who knows? Would be nice to see a turning point now.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:59:51
I think so too, but may I ask you to elaborate? Gut feeling? TA? 
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:22:06
BTC price hasn't been this stable since early December.
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:49:43


Good point. Before jumping to conclusions, I would stop for a moment and look at how the media has a habit of doing this about a lot of things. But it has been strange to watch the last 3-4 days of BTC "reporting".
Let's hope we see some slow and steady growth now, not spikes and stomach churning drops.
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:15:03
Speculators.. Who's doing this yo-yo s***? When the price stabilizes it will go up. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 09:23:09
