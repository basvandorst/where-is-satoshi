~$34,000,000,000,000 stock market
~$171,000,000,000 crypto market

I mean their are rules in place when you own more than 10% of a company if I recall. It’s not Berkshire, the SEC will not allow him to sell. He can schedule them ahead of time.

Section 16 of the Exchange Act applies to an SEC reporting company's directors and officers, as well as shareholders who own more than 10% of a class of the company's equity securities registered under the Exchange Act.

Damn right! Every night I work, I buy $50 BTC. I hope the price stays right where it is for the next year.

Buying real estate is gambling. Buying stock is gambling. Investing is gambling. That could be a blue chip 2% return. It may be a 5% Cap Starbucks 20 year ground lease. It may be a 12-unit apartment complex, where you put a bunch of money in and return 26%. It’s all gambling. It’s just a matter of your risk tolerance.
