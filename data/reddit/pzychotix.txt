Err, no, they wouldn't. That's the point of it being a cold wallet. You can't attack a cold wallet through a server since a cold wallet is by definition not connected to anything. The only way you could attack the cold wallet is if they brought coins from the cold wallet to the hot wallet, but at that point you need human elements to withdraw it, and someone should be asking questions why suddenly the hot wallet got emptied in under a minute, and **not** fund the hot wallet with more coins waiting to be stolen.

There are these things called "audits".
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:29:57
That's not how tax audits work.

Why the fuck are you factoring in inflation as a fee?
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:07:27
I didn't say that the current situation was caused by deflation, but rather that the situation of 1000% growth causes people to use the numbers you decried. While it may not be deflation (the wikipedia article on deflation has at least one definition that disagrees, but I digress), the growth in value of bitcoin certainly simulates the same effects as deflation.

Well, the burden of proof is on you first that you've complied with all reporting and regulations. If such is proven, then it falls to the IRS to make their claim.
Really, all you would have to do in such a case is then show all your books and stuff showing that you did not make a bajillion dollars. Which is why the IRS wouldn't make up a claim out of thin air. But if they see something like bitcoin mining activity which you didn't report or purchases made with bitcoin (via the NSA or whatever), the burden of proof would fall back to you.

With $18 million, there are much less risky ways to get just a 10% return than bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-16 17:39:16
Not with the IRS.
@_date: 2014-04-16 17:34:48
It's up to you to prove cost basis, not the IRS. If you have zero documentation for how you get it, cost basis is assumed to be zero.
@_date: 2014-04-16 17:44:13
Then the IRS comes to you and says: "Hey, we saw 1000 BTC leave your address. Prove where it went or pay your taxes."

@_date: 2014-06-12 22:39:31


The point is that you can do that with less risk elsewhere.


Just because one bitcoin sells for $550 today doesn't mean that you can sell 30,000 bitcoins for $550. You're going to have to offload those coins over quite a while, and doing that is just going to expose you to more risk.
"Easy return" this is not.

Until the IRS comes knocking with an audit, and then you better hope you have your shit in order.

Erm, consider any electronics store. They purchase the TVs from some wholesaler for cheap and then sell it to consumers.
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:42:31
Which is why you file your fucking taxes and don't do stupid shit like not reporting income.
Burden of proof doesn't mean impossible to prove.

Well, many people are buying bitcoins through traceable methods (like bank withdrawals). But even then, it's not the bitcoins you have is important. It's the income, and when you start buying stuff with money that the IRS doesn't see you having, that raises eyebrows. It's up to you to show that you did it with legit money (like forex trading (bitcoins)).
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:57:16
Err, that's because of massive government spending.

You've just described the Paradox of Thrift:
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:26:05
Not buying a new TV or pool means less production of TVs in factories and less work for pool workers which in theory means a slower growing economy.

Plenty of people buy new and plenty of people buy used. Your argument certainly isn't very convincing on its own.
And bitcoin shooting up in value 1000% might have something to do with the numbers.

It's like being paid in stock. You pay income taxes on the market value of the stock the day you receive it, and then capital gains/losses apply when you sell it.

The size of the bitcoin tip is not taken into account. Tips are simply not allowed.
@_date: 2015-02-08 09:19:16
Mod from here (though not the one who instituted the ban).
As a reminder, we do not allow tip bots, nor the summoning of tip bots in We've experienced a large amount of spam in the past, so we crack down on any cases we see now. We're not wholly unwelcome to suggestions of bitcoin where it's on-topic, but bitcoin tipping is currently a no-go.
@_date: 2015-02-08 19:19:46
It's covered under our [rules]( under section 2.12.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:08:44
Our main concern is really just keeping the comments section as clean as possible so that the posters asking questions (or other commenters with questions) don't have to sift through clutter and spam. If you PM a mod with an honest offer to tip him, you're not going to get banned. Or if you do get banned by a itchy click fingered mod, send us a modmail to appeal the decision. Generally, if you come to us with a well-mannered appeal and your violation wasn't extremely serious (or you show promise of reversing your behavior in the future), we'll lift the ban.
@_date: 2015-02-13 05:22:11
The only alternative is to not tip whatsoever. If you want to suggest the usage of bitcoin in our sub, that's ok provided that it doesn't come at the detriment of our other users. But our stance on tip bots still stands.
@_date: 2015-02-08 19:15:33
Well, you could just PM him straight up, instead of making a reply in the comments section offering to PM, and us mods would be none the wiser.

My question is, what does it matter if these guys hold onto the coins then? How does holding onto these coins indefinitely further the cause of making the coins widespread?
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:06:36
Well there'd be no reason to do so on the exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:30:18
