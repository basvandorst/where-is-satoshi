They have many software issues, 1 the software can glitch and send duplicate BTC and even after they acknowledge the error it has been over a month and no refund, 2 the auto refund issue is worse than you think, even if you controlled the sending wallet and it gets auto refunded cause you used a wallet at coinbase that was one of your product wallets, the BTC HAS NOT SHOW UP in my other wallet

Coinbase software can create a duplicate payment and they will not make it right for the user

Coinbase support is a nonevent even if they have a software bug that duplicates sending BTC out of your waller. My ticket is over a month old. They promised to make it right but they are just giving me lip sevice.

You handled a support ticket from me over 30 days ago about the duplicate sending of BTC To a vendor. You said it was a software bug that happened and you were going to fix it. I still don't have the duplicate transaction funds returned to me. Several support people including Rees have emailed that Coinbase was not going to make users have to eat software bugs and mistakes. Why are you guys not responding?
