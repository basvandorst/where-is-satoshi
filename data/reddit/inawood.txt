Wierd, it probably uses up more time to post a comment and wait for a reply than it does to click the link. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:46:00
Because they have a year long ICO...
Every day people buy some via the ICO and get EOS for good price. They then sell on an exchange for ETH at higher price, then use that eth to buy more EOS. So they get richer and push the price up.
If it will dump when they release the new EOS, I don't know.
So it might not be a pump and dump, but it deffo gets a false pump.

You don't think what? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:23:11
Vitalik doesn't really talk price, he talks fundamentals and development, I guess that pushes price.
Which banksters does he need to pay? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:24:43
EOS the year long ICO pump and dump �� 
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:43:04
Yeah he's a full on bell end.

Wait, didn't you like, click the link?

Nice, you have cleared up a lot of things. I hope LN gets full adoption and other solutions, as you say, time will tell.
I take it if you want to add more funds to an open channel that's a normal btc tx and includes a fee. Hope we can see those fees come down! 
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:59:28


Cool, thanks a lot for taking the time to explain, it has clarified some things. Not everything is a 'misrepresentation' looking to damage bitcoin, but when the scaling solution is this convoluted you can surely understand that people have a hard time wrapping their head around it. 




In a wallet that you will only use with certain people? More like preloading a multishop gift card? 




I am aware channels can be closed whenever, just if someone is only going to buy from somewhere once using LN, it's pointless as they get a double fee. So people must commit a certain amount of btc to the LN to be use on LN tx. 
So say for micropayments. You wanna load up £30 for a daily £1 coffee for a month, you first pay the btc £20 fee to open a channel and at the end pay £20 to close it? I recognise you say tx fees will fall IF this gets more adoption, but still... 




See above, it's not fully locked, but held there in place. 


LN is far removed from withdrawing cash from the bank and putting it in your wallet... 








Yeah I mean, if this is the main thing to save bitcoin by solving its scaling then I hope it works but it just seems very unintuitive, I hope that is solved via the UI / UX for LN. I do think scaling need to be solved at protocol/ main network level though, hopefully some more ideas come out. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:09:28
But you have to preload the channel with some BTC that you suspect you will use / or not use until the channel is closed?
So you essentially lock up an amount of btc that you might spend. With a fee to open, and close? The channel...

Wow I see his felon now, makes him even more mental.
I'm betting on them both, but they are both only a small part of my folio. But BCash works like satoshi wanted, he said to raise the blocksize when mempool gets clogged. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:04:07
Lol no, it's a fake screenshot. Why I out of all the altcoins would they add ETC? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:38:51
How so? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:42:09
Yeah I used to have a pretty strict opinion like that. Now I 'play both sides' well many sides actually. I've diversified away from bitcoin but I still hold core and cash. I can see them both being there, bitcoin as a 'store of value' as many people seem to want and cash as a usable form of peer to peer cash like satoshi envisioned.
You cannot be completely blind to the problems bitcoin core has? Did you sell all of your BCH and really don't even wanna hold a little? Seems silly to me not to hedge. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:41:39
Yes and no
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:58:37
Hoping so as well �� 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:05:44

Either way the whole crypto market is heavily manipulated, what you want done about it? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:33:18
Opinion, just like yours
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:43:38
That must be a spike on coinbase from people FOMOing to buy?
I was asleep and I'm not seeing any 5k rise on other exchanges? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:59:01
Yeah of course they would say they're investigating for their image. It was just the small order book getting filled, kinda irresponsible opening with such a thin book.
This isn't a regulated market though, manipulation is everywhere, felon involved or not. Let's see what happens in an hour! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:01:04
Ah my bad, I couldn't find it, it's always good to doubt screenshots though. 
The page now 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:18:43
Roger is a felon? What for? I don't like him much but I'm not betting on emotion, fundamentals actually. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:27:41
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:10:14


I don't think they admitted it, just said they are investigating it. 


Which they will probably do, can't have a super fast investigation. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:22:09
Haha do you think I'm joking or something? It's a pretty reasonable opinion. Unless you could point out any inaccuracies? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:57:46
From what I'm reading it's more like the opposite of a flash crash with market orders getting filled. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:00:05
Didn't think I would have to explain, gave you the benefit of the doubt on that one but alas you are too far gone. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:55:50
Bit out of the loop, were people spamming the network? With like very low value transactions or what? Is there some evidence I can look at to show this? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:14:00
What do you mean when you say 'lose everything'? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:39:38
Surely the tx fee / speed thing is kinda ruining the reputation?
Edit: Why the downvotes? Genuine question, if you disagree then explain why? 
I've had a few people get into crypto (bitcoin) recently and it was a pretty disastrous experience compared to when I did. Now I am recommending they may as well go straight for ethereum, monero or litecoin, since they can easily be transacted for cheap. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:03:55
'him' who must not be named? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:08:53
It creates both by default, the part in the screenshot you are referring to is a newly added feature. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:03:40
I am genuinely interested and got at least one good answer. It is good bants at the same time though. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:52:45
Please explain how it's obvious?
I am on neither side, as I hold both. If anything I'm and eth shill. But fair enough I just wanted to see for myself how this sub acts. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:00:26
Yes but fees, which can also be confusing for new users. I am replying to someone talking about bitcoin reputation with a point about something damaging to it'd reputation... I ain't waltzing anywhere m9
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:03:11
Yeah I was kinda aware that this was the case, wanted to ask a genuine question and kind of experiment how fast it would get downvoted at the same time, answer = faster than a bitcoin tx. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:30:47
Don't fink so like.
This creates a btc and bch wallet with the same address, send btc to it and you get btc... 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:53:31
Until they buy it and try to use it?
How can you be so sure they do not know about it before? There were quite a few articles surrounding the latest tx backlog... 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:02:10
This wallet can hold btc and bch under the same address. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:29:49


What does that even mean? Fees are unimportant? And they are not that high so could go higher and that's no big deal?
How do you presume people will lose all their money following bitcoin.com? As in buying bitcoin cash and it tanking to 0? You really think that will happen?
My advice would be to have a diversified portfolio to stop that effecting you so much. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:08:33
Wow an actual good answer, thank you. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:49:41
Eh it's only the second highest priced coin, it's dead I tell you! 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:13:00
Please expand on your comment?
'people like you' what about me?
Bitcoin started it all, satoshis vision of electronic cash has been changed.
So I take it people like you don't mind btc having higher fees than PayPal? 
@_date: 2017-04-17 10:58:23
In the UK you can transfer money to anyone's UK bank account for free. It says it usually takes 2 hours but in my experience it is always instant.

To cause panic so the price drops so they can buy more.
