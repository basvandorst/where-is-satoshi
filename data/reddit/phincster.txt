Just means a handjob will feel like a footjob.

Interesting.  What these guys should have done is embed a super small amount of bitcoin into each game.  Maybe keys sealed in a baseball card type foil.  That way, when none of these things sell they can at least keep em for the bitcoin.

I bought my first bitcoin at 200 bucks.  I invest in stocks and real estate.  I Also always have a decent amount of cash in accounts.  Bitcoin has outperformed all of it.  If your time horizon is over four years, bitcoin is the best store of value.  Under four years, maybe not so much.
Edit- and by outperformed i mean if i sold it all now bitcoin would have gained me the most

Interesting, must be the farmers rounding out their books for the year.  Or maybe the general populace getting ready for christmas by freeing up some cash.

I dont know if it translates to bitcoin, but sometimes with stocks the technical analysis will affect people’s decision making.  Yes analysis seems like voodoo, but if enough people follow the charts, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.
For example, if everyone sees a particular support line, everyone tends to buy at that support because they can all see it in the chart.  They also wait till it hits the line, cause once again, they can see it in the chart. The analysis becomes self fulfilling.

I dont think the average person will pay attention until 20k. They probably figure its a pump and dump.  Once it blows past 20k they’ll realize it aint coming back, but then itll be too late

Ive been investing in stocks for almost two decades and have made plenty of money.  Stocks have a real value.  You literally get to vote when stuff comes up.  Dividends come directly to your account.  Ive done well.  
Having said that, bitcoin has outperformed all but one or two of all the stocks i have ever invested in.  
If the brokerages dont allow you to withdraw the bitcoin directly to your own private wallet, theres no reason to buy with them.  I would just get it directly from somewhere else.

Dude, ive owned bitcoin since 200 dollars.  I just told you it outperformed almost every stock i own.  Im not knocking bitcoin.  Just saying stocks have done well as well, just not to the same levels as my bitcoin holdings.
Another advantage of stocks honestly that theyre close to impossible to lose or get stolen.  Theyre linked to you legally so really cant be lost in a traditional sense.
Either way, ive been liquidating a lot of my stocks and switching to bitcoin for a few years now

After the next halving bitcoin inflation rate will drop below that of the US dollar.  This halving is different.

Its anonymous if you acquired it anonymously.

You’re absolutely right.  If bitcoin were a penny someone could buy all the bitcoin with $180,000.  I could literally keep it from going zero by myself.

The outperformance is from what ive seen measured in dollars. Ive had bitcoin since about 300 and have been adding since then.  
I also invest in the stock market and have a 401k.  I also have owned several homes and participated in house flips.  My bitcoin has outperformed everything else.  I was simply curious if there will be repercussions once institutions get into the act on a large scale.  
What you said about first adopter makes sense though.  Thanks for that.
@_date: 2019-09-11 23:39:02
But it’s a store of value that outperforms all other investments.  What happens when it goes institutional?  Insitutions and corporations are mandated to get the best returns.
Edit- why would anyone invest bitcoin in a business when simply holding the bitcoin is a better return
@_date: 2019-09-26 03:00:20
I may be in the negative, but the value of bitcoin will always be 1 dollar as long as i have a dollar to buy one and am willing to do so.
Edit - lets say there was a machine that would give you a dollar if you fed it a rock.  No matter what.  What is a rock worth now?  Obviously a rock has no value to anyone.  Yet it is still worth a dollar now.  Because no matter what, you can go to the machine and get a dollar.

This isnt true, if a stock doesnt trade for a day, its price doesnt go to zero.  
Also there is still a buyer....me
Edit- point im trying to make is bitcoin going to zero is close to impossible at this point.
@_date: 2019-09-26 05:22:17
Not really.  Just trying to say that at this point bitcoin will probably never go to zero.  Lot of people are saying it, not just me.
@_date: 2019-09-26 05:06:42
I can lend it out and tell the person its worth a dollar if they give it back.
Edit - thats basically what the treasury does, lol
@_date: 2019-09-25 18:03:49
Lets put it this way, no one else in the world but me wants bitcoin.  But i am willing to buy it for a dollar.  You happen to find a bitcoin.  Whats it worth?
@_date: 2019-09-26 00:52:24
Bravo.....still not zero.
@_date: 2019-09-25 17:55:44
Not true, it just takes one buyer is what Im saying.  And Im saying im that buyer.  So it has value, even if just one person buys it.
@_date: 2019-09-25 17:07:40
The price would be set at one penny forever because i bought it all, which is still not zero.  As long as i am alive, and have money, bitcoin will never be zero
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:38:05
Honestly there is no way to tell if robinhood even has any bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-15 22:38:45
Its because the halving is about a year away.  A year is not a long time in the grand scheme of things and it can take a few days to move large amounts of money.  You could entirely miss a large move up.
@_date: 2019-05-28 06:09:42
Dude probably has a ton of bitcoin leftover, which is why he doesn’t really kill himself over the pizza.

If a bank was robbed of almost all its funds, people wouldnt stop using money.  They would stop using that bank or all banks in general.
