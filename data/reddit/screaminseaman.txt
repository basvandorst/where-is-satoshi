Oh yeah do you mine bitcoin?  Bitcoin is already centralized and 95% is mined by huge mining farms where electricity is cheap.  Fine keep the blocks small, fees go to $150 and bitcoin price goes back to $100 because it is useless as a currency.

Why not make the blocksize 2MB for now, is anyone against this?

98% of their coins are kept offline (impossible to hack coins in cold storage)

Transfer from GDAX to Gemini with ETH, then buy BTC duh

Oh so $40 transaction fees with an 8 hour wait time is a usable currency?

$108 to send .5 Bitcoin is healthy?

Coinbase is insured by the FDIC, so it is impossible.

The average bitcoin transaction fee is currently $32

When? Transaction fees have only increased this year not decreased.

Is there any solution here or just problems?
The blocks are 1MB right now so can't get worse than it already is.

1.  How many places accept Bitcoin compared to Ethereum?  Bitcoin is more universally used so it is valued higher.  There are 180 paper currencies in the world, but only a few matter.
2.  If bitcoin becomes a daily used currency worldwide it can be comparable to gold ($500,000 per BTC).  There are dissertations and millions of articles describing the value of bitcoin, so do a google search.

Look at other currencies in human history.  If 30%+ of the population uses Bitcoin for daily transactions the value is much higher than a market cap of $70 Billion ($5000 each).  You aren't going to find a 1+1=2 answer here, no one knows the exact intrinsic value yet.
