thank you! I like how I can send btc to an address directly from my card.

itd be nice if I wasnt told by the rep that I am probably entering my CC security card wrong. its 3 numbers man. Already checked twice with my bank on the format/spelling of name and address and still isnt being validated. I've done all the troubleshooting already. at least what I can do on my side of it. 
edit: in addition, circle.com's verification worked on the first try

Well it's been lingering around 1k/each for quite some time and the last time it dipped, it spiked right back up within a week. this is dip  as far as I know and I'm quite sure its coming back up.

thats one thing i thought about. Its so unstable to use as a currency right now. You could sell a sandwhiches for BTC and quadtruple your money on it by the next week. but then come time to pay bills, you have 10 cents in USD

when they were around $125 a piece I used them for goods and services all the time...
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:46:51
Ive heard of litecoins but havent looked much into them. And yeah Since I bought them, the lowest theyve dropped today that ive seen is 719 so :\ 
Makes me wish I had kept my .36 from back when they were 125 a piece &gt;_&lt;
