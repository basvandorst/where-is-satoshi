How can we know coin loss rate? There's no way to know whether someone is holding or has lost their coin, right?

How about philanthropy? E.g. Pineapple Fund. Some people do good for others with wealth.

What was the fee to move your funds to new segwit address?

Finally an app that allows us to track our crypto holdings by entering in wallet addresses!
Are there other apps that allow me to track balances by watching public blockchain addresses?

Yay! Thanks for all the donations, and especially fantastic to see MAPS in there!

I do think what Bitcoin.com did was misleading and "wrong", but I'll be interested to see whether it actually *resulted* in any financial losses for anyone. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 03:36:47
I'd be interested to see this "research" updated to include data after Oct. 2016.

Commodities and investment vehicles change, but market behavior doesn't. Blockchain may be revolutionary, but there's nothing new or revolutionary about the naked apes buying and selling it.
@_date: 2018-06-18 00:31:50
Yes, it's that clown.

People take money *out of* speculative investments in recessions, meaning more people selling BTC and less people buying, thereby driving down the price. BTC could be a hedge *one day*, but it's also likely BTC's price, at this stage, follows larger economic markets. Less disposable income (or fear of) means less spending and buying. Lower demand creates lower price. I'm all for BTC and crypto, but it's still a long way from being a *mainstream* asset.

How is it possible to tell a node to prioritize transactions involving specific addresses (transactions involving your wallet addresses)? Isn't it mindlessly verifying *arbitrary* network transactions? How is it that you instruct it to verify *your* transactions immediately instead of others'?

Wtf is this supposed to mean? Asking for a friend.

I won't have a problem if I send the BTC in my Gemini account to my hardware wallet SegWit address, right?
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:16:11
I'm thoroughly confused. So what are you predicting for where we go from here? Bubble pops?
@_date: 2019-12-25 01:06:39
Same. Super happy.

In Venezuela, you could answer: used it to avoid losing my entire life's savings to hyperinflation.

"Priced in" just means the current price already reflects the information that the mined supply will decrease by half. It doesn't say anything about buying behavior other than the market price already accounts for the halving. Anything else is specious conjecture.
@_date: 2019-12-27 23:27:06
That's the issue--there's nothing more to say. What sellers, including miners, or buyers do or change about their behavior is unknown. It's all speculation. All we can say is that people who know about the halving may be behaving differently than they would without awareness of the halving.
@_date: 2019-12-27 23:48:15
Okay, we are on same page. Forgive me. Nobody knows how individuals buyers have priced in the halving. The behavior of individual inventors would have to be studied. I am not aware of any academic analyses having done this. There may be behavioral trends, but each person (or institution) is unique. Personally, my buying behavior has not and will not change--its based on external factors like disposable income.
@_date: 2019-12-27 23:34:39
I think we may be speaking past one another. Halving has happened before. Miners receive half as much ad they used to, while spending the exact same amount in expenses to acquire their BTC. Many mining operations have to sell a large chunk of their mining rewards to pay bills, regardless of how much they're worth. So they'd like to get doublethe price, of course, but that doesn't mean the market will suddenly pay double. Buyers tend to be willing to pay a little more leading up to and shortly after halvings, but the price regresses toward the mean (i.e. normalizes) in the months after.
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:16:01
In this thread: people so used to being inundated with bullshit TA chart patterns that they fail to identify genuine regression modeling.

How is this interactive?
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:23:16
This is just for capital gains that you're talking about, right? If I have a business (let's say sole proprietorship, Schedule C) and my revenue is $50k while my expenses are $100K, I can still report **-**$50K income on that business, right?

Step 1: Company signs up to Bitwage.
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:59:41
Right, but if the cost of mining is greater than the market price, then the miner could have bought 1 BTC at $4000 today instead of spending $5000 mining.
@_date: 2018-02-20 05:49:49
Coinbase was around. Was pretty easy IMHO. Can only speak for myself though.
@_date: 2018-07-30 15:15:01
Right, but you'd be surprised how many people think "correction" means BTC back at $19K.
@_date: 2018-07-30 17:59:38
Right, and that's why we consider context.
@_date: 2018-07-30 06:17:10
You mean correction back down, right?
EDIT: Geeze people, the downvotes? There are an alarming number of people that believe "correction" means BTC "recovering" back into all-time high territory (yes, really), and I wanted to explicitly point out that this is not what was saying, for anyone who might've fallen into that confused camp.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:52:51
The late-comers are always delusional. You are so dead right, and that post of yours was great. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:49:21
What did you use to chart this?
@_date: 2018-04-16 16:41:11
I reported my mining operation income. Spent way more on hardware than I earned, so actually got a fat refund. Figuring out the taxes is what has kept me from getting into *trading* though.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:47:15
Depends on how long you want to hold it. Start the chart two years back and the mean's $800 - $1,000.
