Not the point though. The OTC market was pretty big too. It was easier to get 1M BTC then than it is now.

Everything has a bottom. When people stop caring about something, it becomes worthless. The thing is that BTC is not owned by anyone, therefor much more robust against these politics-dependent situations. In fact, political situations that endanger the financial climate just help bitcoin. How many fiat currencies can say you say the same about?

This guy does have a point.
@_date: 2019-02-25 23:59:51
Yes i do. It’s a bitter memorabilia of the old days.
@_date: 2019-02-26 00:04:33
I paid for this one though. Probably have the order email too.
@_date: 2019-02-26 14:33:46
Well spotted! Good question? Haven’t got a clue
@_date: 2019-02-26 00:03:36
I’ve got that too.
@_date: 2019-02-25 23:58:28
What should i do with it?
@_date: 2019-02-25 23:58:10
Haha ��
@_date: 2019-02-25 23:58:56
Let’s suppose mtgox was still alive: Well have fun. There’s nothing there. Never trust(ed) exchanges to begin with ;-)
@_date: 2019-02-26 00:02:41
Nice. Perhaps i’ll start using it again. Great camouflage ��
@_date: 2011-09-11 10:51:13
But it's not just that. When you have ONLY hi-quality apps in your portfolio, people start contacting you for projects more than before.
@_date: 2011-09-11 10:46:35
Thanks for the feedback! We've got a few cool features coming up, but all are bitcoin related. Perhaps in the future we will add other cryptocurrencies, but for now there's no such thing planned.
@_date: 2011-09-11 10:48:56
Youre right! Thanks for pointing that out, and the pricing strategy is a very interesting one, but you could be right too. 
@_date: 2011-06-30 13:49:51
I'd like an invite too, if you have any left. Thanks ;-)
@_date: 2011-09-11 10:47:46
Sorry :-) we're iOS devs
@_date: 2011-09-10 18:52:07
Thank you! :-)
@_date: 2011-09-11 10:44:26
thank you :-)
@_date: 2011-09-13 06:03:26
Namaste! And same to you!
@_date: 2011-09-13 05:51:12
Yes, solid chances ;-)
@_date: 2011-09-11 10:45:01
Uhh.. it's been approved and its available in the appstore now.
Sorry, no android version, were iOS devs.
@_date: 2011-09-10 14:51:43
thank you! the existing bitcoin apps just weren't sufficiënt at the time, and i dont think the apps on the appstore are that much different. Let's hope there's still a market for it. I think it's pretty feature rich, but what would you like to see added to this? any constructive criticism (positive or negative) is much appreciated
@_date: 2011-06-30 09:51:39


You will realize.. There is no spoon.
@_date: 2011-09-13 05:50:43
Tap the tab to refresh? There was a problem with the Markets API but it should be fixed now.
@_date: 2011-09-10 18:51:13
That the hype around bitcoin has weakened in the last weeks and weighted prices have dropped. It's good to see how much interest there is in this app, because we've got a ton of cool features planned, but if there is no market for this app it would be a waste of time.
@_date: 2011-06-29 14:04:55
Nailed it. However, i don't think they will do anything with it, nor update the article. Forbes has their own interests in this matter.
@_date: 2011-09-10 15:46:33
Appreciate the honest opinion, it's good to have it finished, approved and online now.
@_date: 2011-09-10 14:46:18
That's around the time we started working weekends on it ;-)
@_date: 2011-09-11 10:47:37
Nope, it's not a wallet. We hope to implement such functionality in the future, it depends mostly on security related matters.
@_date: 2011-09-11 10:44:09
i dont think it will ever "die". However, the interest in it from the general public has droppend a bit. Noticeable in the value of it also. 
@_date: 2011-09-11 10:49:48
Thanks dude! Great feedback! :-)
@_date: 2013-05-07 12:13:41
Sorry and thanks :)
