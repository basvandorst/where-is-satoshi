Crux of the article:


Yes. There will always be a relative high energy usage bogeyman to blame...if bitcoin goes down people will just move to the next thing on the list. The focus should be on the real reason WHY that energy usage is a problem (because using energy is not inherently a bad thing), and the answer is governments that permit and promote shitty sources for that energy. In a perverse way things like Bitcoin could actually increase pressure to move to more rational and modern energy sources and one would no longer have to worry how much coal was being burned for that microwaved burrito.

Dude, trying to block theft is not a bad thing. Once you approve it they should let future such charges go through just fine. 
I've had transactions for clothing at retailers I never used before get blocked. It's not some anti-bitcoin thing.

Yup. The day AOL opened up to the web and newsgroups was one of the biggest floodgate events (perhaps ever, to that point) of general consumers to the internet proper. For most of its life AOL was an isolated online service (same went for Compuserve, Prodigy and the like). That move was also a big step towards the death of AOL itself (and those peers).

Just because we have more computing power today than back then doesn't mean all tasks require modern computing power. Your logic is absurd.

Nobody cares that it's at $12K because most expect it to go much higher. And if they didn't expect that they probably sold at $10K.

Most people who can afford to invest are liquid enough to buy consumer goods. They don't put all of their cash into investment assets. They might liquidate for a downpayment on a home or car or something, but that's not exactly a holiday season trend.

Posts like this are cringy. Who are you trying to convince that you're happy with this market, OP?
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:47:53
I disagree strongly. Sure, general public awareness of crypto went from practically zero to something measurable last year, but the vaaaaaaast majority still didn't (and do not) truly understand what it is, much less how to actually get into it. This is still a niche market. Late 2018 was just a hint of the potential. This isn't to say it's guaranteed to blow up again anytime soon, but we haven't seen squat in terms of the potential upside.

You could toss some cash in and have about the best odds at a 10-20% gain over the next week or two that you'll ever see. Or you can stand on the sideline hoping it fails. Do as you please!

But in columns you only have to shuffle sideways 3/4 times. With this format, you have to physically walk sideways and back 50+ times. It wouldn't be tiring, but super irritating. Even if you could read it standing in place, you'd lose your line very easily, with increasing frustration the further you get. Columns make it far less likely that you lose what line you're on when your eyes go back to the left (there's a reason why newspapers use columns).
Columns would be a huge improvement.

The much more likely trigger would be a banking crisis in China, or something nuts happening with Taiwan (e.g. the former invading).

I think the bigger issue is that they stole the logo and name (mostly) so they could piggyback on the reputation, rather than calling it something entirely different. Fork or not it's a new beast and it's unethical to imply otherwise. But as I said in my other post, this is what happens when you don't pursue IP protections.
Edit: Another way to look at it: if Bitcoin Cash had been called anything else, would it have ever gained traction over Litecoin, which appears to be superior overall in terms of addressing the very thing BCH was intended for? I'd say the answer to that is "hell no it wouldn't". In that sense, BCH relied on the reputation of what amounts to a competitor to gain an edge over yet another competitor it otherwise would not have. This is, to me, fundamentally unethical, even if it's not illegal. The diehards in the BCH community like to claim that BTC is preying on ignorance, and I find that ironic, because BCH name (and that logo!!!) is a deliberate attempt to do the same.

Not sure what timeframe you're speaking of. Lots of alts went ballistic in 2017.

If it increases in value after the time of acquisition, it is by definition a valid investment vehicle. And people DO invest in currencies. It's an entire specialized discipline.

Will you say the same in 15 years if this sector continues its juvenile laissez-faire ways and the Googles, Microsofts, and Oracles of the world take control of it all?

I feel a little bad for the people who jumped on the BCH surge at the top or sold BTC at the bottom. Again, this all operates just like the stock market...once you see the trend it's probably too late to jump on it.
I sat on my hands this time around. Glad I did.

Alts are a riskier bet now though due to regional exchange crackdowns. We've even seen it in the recent bull market...alts have had a harder time keeping pace than they have in the past.

Not sure if you're being snarky or not, but the Linux ecosystem is indeed a hot mess and isn't anything the crypto space should aspire to, if there is any true aspiration to become mainstream. Such confusion is directly at odds with mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:44:43
My point is that branding (and "Linux" *is* branding, albeit the branding of a project) matters to the general consciousness. And confusion as to what that applies to flies in the face of any effort to gain popular acceptance. There's also nothing preventing IP protection for the branding of an open source project.
We can talk all day about the differences/challenges involved in the open nature of crypto, but the fact remains that many aspects of the community and its naivete are counter productive to the ends we supposedly desire.

This is what refusing IP protection looks like. Can't really complain. It's the inevitable result.

I'm in HODL mode anywhere under 10K. Certainly buy more if it hits those 6500-7000 levels but I wouldn't risk selling no matter what.

True or not, none of that is really the point. Bitcoin is bitcoin. A hard fork new development that is more in line with the initial vision is still a new development.
An analogy might be if a gamer thought their favorite game got off track, so made their own game based on the original vision, and tried to market it under the same name.
Or just making a forum site and calling it "Better Reddit".

Really good point. If BTC isn't money, then why are they being paid back in money?

Kinda. I mean, if you want a pretty strong bet on a 5% return over the next few weeks...could be tomorrow, could be February...this is as good as any. Though obviously it could decrease more first.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:05:49
You're right, but the fiat value history for Bitcoin is easy to track. Who'd be stupid enough to pay above market value?
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:59:12
People no doubt FOMO'd on the short side on the way down. I'm sure there are plenty who shorted BTC when it was already sub-$10K. Just like people who got in at the top got hosed, a lot of shorts are gonna get burned. Never chase the market, people...

That would be "healthy growth" in a traditional sense (and even then, a pretty extreme example compared to most markets), but we all know this market is insanely mercurial and prone to wild movement. We could just as likely blow far beyond that or land where we started the year.

Good journalists will get it right. The problem is professional journalism isn't appreciated in current society, and denigration of the field just makes things worse.
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:21:39
I trust legit professional news journalists. The problem is so much out there is written by hacks because people don't value professionalism anymore. And (also) people putting too much weight in glorified opinion pieces like this one. 
I should also add that all new technology (or at least new to the mainstream) breeds skeptics. That isn't new. See this waaaaay too cynical view of the future of the internet from 1995:

This. And I like Warren Buffet. He's the first to admit how wrong he's been on various investments (or non-investments) in the past. But people ask for his opinion and he's happy to offer it, as flawed as it could be. Not gonna fault him for it, especially when this is a bit outside his wheelhouse (and frankly even if he understood it, this sort of investment isn't really his thing...he buys companies).
