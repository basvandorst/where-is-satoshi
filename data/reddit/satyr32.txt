bitcoin has a huge first mover advantage. so many people believe in this coin and work with the coin and accept it as currency. in the long term, yes, bitcoin can go away, but this will not happen in the near future and not from one day to another. as i said bitcoin will probably not be the coin which will be uses to pay everdays good, because other blockchain do this better.

it is no digital money but digital gold. another crypto will take the lead in digital money in the next years.

was it this adress the bitcoins were transfered?

i do not know if this is correct, but on a youtube video of a respected member of the crypto community he said the the bitcoin price will be 300k if only 0.5% of the money that now is in gold is transfered into bitcoin.

It just needs time. It is possible that we need 25 more years until we finally have the bitcoin how it was intended to be used. we are still in the experiment playground phase. and oh boy do we live in exciting times.

I don't think he is dumb and I don't think he is scared. The simple fact is he just has no clue what bitcoin is.

just wait for a few days before you invest. we don't know yet if we are already at the bottom. litecoin is a good investment. i would put some in NEO, but also not now, just wait a few days till the dust has settled.

then again three years later 1BTC invested is worth 5BTC ... maybe.
