@_date: 2014-02-16 07:36:22
at this price i am 50:50, if it drops much more i'll convert it all.
@_date: 2014-02-19 22:40:43
So you misread everything.  Some people have not done fiat -&gt; btc -&gt; "the fuck out of gox" because of the price difference (and they couldn't withdrap fiat).  Now that the price difference is in their favor they can get their money (either fiat or BTC) out.
Some people have been depositing fiat, and buying at gox's low prices.  It would be safe to assume they are doing this so that they can sell at a profit, which will flood the market with sellers.
When this is over bitcoin can go back to being great, and so i think the price will go up in the "kinda short term", but i think in the days after btc are allowed to flow out we will see a decrease in the trading price.
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:17:09
There is enough money there, and some of it is owned by shady people, that a default by gox will mean very bad things for the profiteers and their families. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 22:15:40
This goes both ways.  Many people have had funds locked at MtGox for a long time now, and this will finally allow them a way to get out.  In some cases people could really use that money and there will likely be a selloff.  Also, some people have been transferring money into gox so that they can sell the BTC when it reopens.
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:06:09
Morale will go through the roof, that is for sure.  When there is a problem with bitcoin about 50% of the time it is the fault of mtg.
@_date: 2014-02-19 23:35:42
The gox price will rise, but i think that the market price will fall.  It is not a net neutral because the gox ecosystem is completely isolated from the BTC ecosystem at the moment.  Think of it this way: if there was a half off sale on bitcoins for a period of time would the price go up or down?  Right now is that sale, but the only reason there is a sale is because it is risky.
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:06:17
so i have had some money stuck at gox for a while, if you were me would you be buying up at these prices, or is it safer to leave as cash?
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:20:28
i've bought quite a bit, but it looks like it keeps falling.  From the other FUD threads it seems that if they are insolvent you aren't much worse off with cash.  I have been let down (just like everyone in the community) so many times that I also don't trust them at all.

He might be drawing attention to it, but his solution is to give free college (without talking about any restraints to applicants), raise the minimum wage, break up banks, and tax rich people. I could write a book about why most of these would be bad, and when it comes to taxing people why change the rate instead of closing the loopholes. I find it absurd, and not politically viable, that we (the commoners) can not write off living expenses such as rent/mortgage, food, and education; but the rich can write off their income properties, and everything else they have, so that they can multiply their wealth.

Absolutely.  Let's deal with SC instead, would you rather have to deal with 13x jalapenos right now, or wait 2 more months to get your SC?  13x could all be ran off of one computer and right now, so it isn't that unmanageable.  At today's rates/difficulty that would be $15k/month or $30k for 2 months.  I think that i would deal with the PITA for that kind of money, even 1/30th of it.
BTW i do not have a MR on order, I just think that it is a very bad move for them to ship to their smallest least loyal customers first.
I also think it would be a good move because all of these gen1 bfl asics would be shipped back at some point, and everyone would have updated machines with fewer problems.

Luke Jr switched from the old system (which backpaid the first people to mine shares before the new people) at some point in the last year.  I mined with them and ECM through the whole thing.  basically what happend is that when the pool was lucky the extra money went to pay some long ago debt, and when the pool was lean the current miners started earning debt but they were in line behind a bunch of other people.  
This had a snowball effect, people didn't want to mine so that other people could get paid, so they quit, so there was less power, so it was harder to get paid, and so on.  the whole thing is fixed now (through rounds of voting and many bad words being exchanged) and it is how i described it above.
when you visit their site you will notice tons of disclaimers about shelved shares and how they are not promised.  i would say that almost all (or all) of the miners there are getting more than 95%, i'm at 99% usually, but that is because of the old days still being on my address.
everyone was paid by the rules at all times, and no one stole any money.  when it comes to money people get very emotional, and this was no different.

They really need a way to withdraw money in a timely manner so that the price discrepancy goes away.  It doesn't even matter what currency it is as long as someone can take advantage of any discrepancy at another exchange.  
For example, if they could quickly process euro transactions then someone could use btc-e to buy, mtgox to sell, transfer the money back, and start over.  Then btc-e would eventually be equal to gox and they deal in USD so someone could do the same thing with btc-e and bitstamp and quickly everything would become equal.
When it takes weeks/months to get money out this really increases risk and ruins any chance of a correction and that is why mtgox is $4-10 more than the rest of the market, and has been for a while.
@_date: 2013-09-25 03:59:08
no, it isn't at all.  you get so many shares for an amount of work done.  if the luck is 100% (it took exactly how much work was expected at the given difficulty) the amount of shares it took to find the block is the difficulty.  if the luck is better than 100% the extra btc goes to pay people that have done more work than they have been paid for.  if the luck is worse the miners continue to get shares, but they aren't guaranteed to be paid for them.
LIFO is just "last in first out" meaning that when the pool has good luck the people who have the youngest shelved shares get paid first.  This seems counterintuitive, but if it was done any other way people would pool hop (leave the pool, but continue to get paid for past work).  Anyway, they are not taking any money out, and so if you don't get 100% of what you put it is is just luck.

They could start by making sure that their drives don't break the miners.  A lot of casual miners use their desktops for BTC/LTC, but the latest amd drivers do not work with either, and it is really difficult to roll back because their driver has like 10 components, some of which never go away.
@_date: 2013-07-13 16:56:02
I really hope that is true.  I had 2fa for any activities, so hopefully even if they got into the account they weren't able to make any trades or transfer btc out to a new address.  The thieves are more than welcome to transfer it out to any of the exciting addresses though.  :)
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:12:49
That just shows that banks have risked a large amount of money in derivatives.  I am not saying that banks should be able to make risky investments and then expect their depositors to cover the loss; that would just be silly.
@_date: 2013-03-29 02:55:01
They used a 3rd party (i think bitpay) to accept BTC, when people pay in BTC they receive USD.
@_date: 2013-07-31 17:46:11
Another way to look at it is that if it were possible to easily get money out of gox people would be constantly cycling money through at +10% each time (deposit at bitstamp, buy on bitstamp, sell at gox for 10% markup, withdraw at gox, repeat).  I'm actually surprised that no one that has quicker access is taking advantage of this.
@_date: 2013-03-30 14:16:25
Or just dollars before they changed its status (1964);  people "hoarded" them as well, but they called it "saving" instead, and they would accumulate this wealth to do things like retire, or buy a house.
@_date: 2013-05-21 02:23:32
I would be fine with the explanation but it appears that it is every exchange except gox.  right now 
* gox=122.49
* btc-e=113.82
* bitstamp=118.45
* campbx=116.55
So it appears that gox it the odd one out, and that anyone with free access to multiple usd accounts can just sit there and make free money.

@_date: 2013-08-15 20:16:19
The problem with this is that a lot of the heavy traders (not investors or consumers) use GOX and that is why their trade volume is so high.  no one can easily get money out of gox and so there should be a trade volume of zero.

All of the exchanges are higher than they have been for months.  If this rise was caused by people liquidating their gox accounts and selling on other exchanges the prices there would have dropped.  Also the number of transactions for all exchanges are about the same as they have been in the last week (there is not much new activity).

Coinabul has admitted that they received payment, and did not successfully get any items to the customer.  There is no ambiguity about this.  How happy would you be if you paid $500 for something, you never got it and right now if you wouldn't have lost that $500 it would be $3400?  Then the seller told you to fuck off, you contacted him once or twice per day via irc (what the vender wanted him to do) and got no replies.  The whole thing is bad, and I will never support coinabul or suggest it after this.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:38:40
I agree for the most part.  People who were early adopters are sitting on a lot of money, probably more than they have ever had before, and it is way too much to risk for them.  The sooner they sell their positions to people with the money to risk the sooner we no longer have to worry about them.  Like if pirateat40 finally sells his 35kBTC or whatever he has we no longer have to worry about him.  Hopefully he sold the whole thing at $3-$10, but unless someone has been tracking those coins I don't know how many have been spent.
@_date: 2013-07-13 15:45:00

I really like eligius, it is the "most fair" that is possible.  There are no fees, and if the "luck" is down you earn "shelved" shares that are paid back LIFO to prevent hopping.    So i am not getting exactly 100% of what i put in, but it is pretty close.
It is also nice that it doesn't require any registration (your "username" is just the address that you want coins sent to), and that the payout is in virgin coins, and is automated.  The 2 people that are in charge (from what i can tell) are also always on irc if you have any questions.  BTW Luke Jr (the owner of eligius) is pretty big in the bitcoin community, and does a lot for us (the community).

Anyone who is holding thousands of dollars worth of something would rather save their own ass than lose much of that money.

How about ship proportional amounts of jalapeños to preorders. So if they make 1k of them someone who preordered a MR would get 30,000/100 times more jalapeños than someone who ordered a jalapeño at the same time. When the MRs are done there could be a swap back. I'd much rather have to deal with the problem of dealing with 10 jalapeños than watching people who didn't contribute as much as I did make a ton of btc. 
Edit : also remember that 5GH takes many computers and lots of power right now, so people who would invest that kind of money are used to farms of computers to make no where near the power of a few jalapeños. 
Edit 2: most MBs have 3+ usb headers, and then 6 usb ports on the back for a total of 12 usb ports per computer with no hubs. A large power supply could easily do the 4x10 amps on its 12v rails so that is 50GH per computer; pretty nice if you ask me.

There are probably 30 houses within 100m of my house, so even without repeaters or exotic hardware of any kind i could service them.  30x $50-$70 = $1500-$2100 per month.  I'm pretty sure that i could get some sort of package for that, and if i couldn't i could have one of my neighbors act as a relay.  anyway, i know there is more involved than that, but it isn't legal, so there is no point in talking about it.

There is a 10% difference in price right now (and has been for a while).  so these people withdrawing €1000 would only get €900 (minus any other fees) out.  I think the situation is that they are stuck there with no way to access their money other than to take a hit.

i guess it could be seen as that, if you had a list of gox usernames then you could, for all intents and purposes, disable gox by locking all of the customers out of the service.

This is important, but not very important until there is a price stabilization which would imply that fiat is no longer entering the economy.  Right now if you think that BTC is an economy that is going to keep increasing then you would be silly to spend them.  Another problem is that sites like BTCbuy.com use "safe" exchange rates, which translates to a very high percentage loss when the btc/usd is increasing; right now it is 95.67 while BTC/USD is 105, that is a 9.7% markup.

When BFL started taking orders a lot of people decided to do the "safe thing" and continue to buy ati cards betting that delivery wouldn't be so swift.  People also bought rigs of people selling in anticipation of ASIC setups.  Just pointing out that all of us were at a crossroads, and it didn't have much to do with the BTC/USD price.

Many of the people who trade on MtGox also use it as just a place to trade when they think that the market is going to go a certain way.  For example, when the chinese market picked up i am sure people switched their usd -&gt; btc at mtgox, and maybe took profit from it this last week.  As far as i know people in the US still use MtGox, but they can not deposit or withdrawal to their US accounts.

you could take care of it yourself with something like keePass + truecrypt + dropbox or something like that.  I think that as long as you have a good password for lastpass it is unbreakable.  
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:08:38
People trading (either buying or selling) means liquidity, and that is good for any market.  Even though the price is dropping now, that is giving someone out there a chance to buy, and there will be a lot of trading because of this.
@_date: 2013-07-13 18:01:42
I am going to assume that there is nothing i could have done to prevent this other than not having any wealth stored at mt gox.  i feel a little better now that it seems that this was widespread and hopefully the 2fa will block any transfers.  So no, it is still cheap to use, but as always the only person you can trust is yourself.
@_date: 2013-07-13 19:03:00
Lastpass released that and all they know is that there was an anomaly in a data audit or something.  They never found anything actually leaked, and i'm pretty sure something would have happened in the last 2 years if there was a leak.
@_date: 2013-07-13 15:44:08
I am not sure, but if they were able to use it that way they wouldn't have had to reset the password.  I do not think that api was on though, since i never used any programs to manage my MtGox account.  The Reset email has a code, and so anyone can request the email, and then if they intercept that email they can get the code and it is all done.
My guess is that someone in house, or at least someone at the data center that their email is sent from, is dumping the messages.

More importantly why isn't there bitcoin/bitcoin merged mining.  for example what is stopping miners from mining for a pool at the same time as solo mining, and if they get a hit they just keep the 25btc instead of giving it to the pool.

WTF dwolla?  and what is with that 0.1% of merchants shit?  might as well have said 99.9% of dwolla transactions (i'm sure it isn't that high, but i'm also sure that it has been over 50% of transactions in the near past).
this is really shitty news, and will really hurt the US exchanges that use it.
@_date: 2013-09-14 01:15:29
you realize that if you could open a US account you could make %15 per transfer up to a couple hundred thousand per day, right?
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:37:35
you should read a bit about it.  every 10ish minutes a block is made and that is what your transaction is in.  many places say that the transfer isn't done until it is 6 blocks in.

I don't even feel the 1% honestly.  Much better in the US than the 20% spread that is MtGox.

Fluctuation means that it would have to go down, sometimes 100% per week.  What we have right now isn't fluctuations.  Once people add all the money they want we will see stability, just like we have for most of the time before the recent escalation in price.

There are only 3600BTC mined per day, so even if China could obtain all of the hashing power the most they could mine would be 3600BTC.  We would have other problems at that point because of 51% attacks, but they could never corner the market with this. As an aside, they could corner the market by buying it all up.

if you ordered over a year ago the best course of action would be to take delivery, make sure it works alright, and sell it on ebay (if you don't want to use it).  For example the only ones on ebay have been jalapenos and they sell for over $400 right now, if you got a single for $1300 then you could flip it for $4k (assuming same $/GH, it would be lower).  Even if it only got you $1400 you would still be ahead.

Other than the erupter (~same speed, more efficient, more expensive than a gpu) none of those are shipping products.  Every avalon listed on ebay was a preorder, BFL will ship god knows when (especially if you order now, bitmine.ch does not have any chips, and lastly make them myself? serious?

I am blocked from getting in, and unless the reset email expires I was unable to use the reset myself.  I really hope you are right.  I did have 2fa on any activity as well, so hopefully mtgox won't disable that by request.

The way i look at it is that a lot of people have sold their BTC at this point.  The people who are holding on are either in it for a while (like most here) or bought in at these high rates.  In the latter case, if we did see a fall to 60 those people would just buy more.

it is all luck.  if you want the smoothest luck you go with the largest pool.  the integrity of the network is worth rolling the dice to me.  with btcguild you will automatically get some percentage shaved off the top, and then you have luck on top of that (although not as much).  
it is all how lucky you feel, since you bought from BFL you might as well go with eligius as well.  :)
@_date: 2013-10-07 15:25:16
actually that is what should have happened, there should have been a job on some remote computer that released the coins to another key in the case they were compromised.

It is a very nice part of bitcoin.  For example it allows people in high risk countries to buy services/products that they couldn't before.  Also high cc fraud businesses no longer have to worry about extensive identity checks.

I would strongly encourage you to use a more simple program for encryption than truecrypt.  I use aescrypt, it has clients for all systems and is pretty standard.  It does not have any bells and whistles though, like you would have to tar or zip your files first if it was more than one file.  AFAIK only the wallet.dat needs to be saved.  Also don't forget to save some of your public keys to accept BTC into the stored account.
Why are you taking this route over a paper wallet?
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:46:59
you mean 1BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:27:25
I had done this a while back, and ended up using that money to buy more BTC.  Of course this ended up being for the best, but the way I look at it is that they would have to fall pretty far in my case for me to not get my initial investment back, and there have been billions of dollars invested by people who have that kind of money, and i do not think that they are looking to make a quick buck at 250.  I think that they are either looking to make a non-quick buck at 1000 or to see where it ends up in a year or so to either take profit or to use it as, you know, currency. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:06:13
Well, it happens every weekend, and this weekend is even worse because of the holiday.  I think that is a pretty good reason, also if it is true that someone sold 5k ($500,000 worth) at once it would drain the queue and cause some panic selling.
@_date: 2013-07-13 16:57:09

I'm not sure how to phrase this, so I'll just blurt it out.  When donating to a person it is sometimes good to know that they are/are not taken care of for their work.  For example, if you have made $5M from res then I feel that my (much smaller than 1btc) donation would be better used for another project. Otoh if you have only made a couple tens of thousands, I would be more likely to donate again (i've donated times in the past).
@_date: 2013-09-26 14:57:43
This doesn't work like other pools since the deposits come from a freshly minted block.  once you cross 0.16xx BTC you are queued for payout. once you are queued for payout you typically have to wait until the pool finds a block or two to be paid, and you will be paid for what you are owed at the time you are paid.  this means that you will get varying amounts.  [here is]( a typical miner at 60GH/s, you can look up any of the contributors up at the top.  you can see that it is typically between 0.18 and 0.23, but there will be outliers.

@_date: 2013-03-29 18:34:02
"next july" do you mean 16 months from now?  If i was in your shoes I would not place a pre-order right now.  I would wait until they ship and are known to work, and then either: place an order at that point (if bfl_josh is to be believed the later unitis might be of higher quality), or buy one from someone who received their pre-order for a huge premium that you would make up by having it sooner rather than waiting.
They are planning to ship hundreds per day, so even if you don't get in until they start shipping you will not have been pushed far back in the line.  There will be a huge amount of new orders when they release the vouchers, so be warned about that.

from BTC -&gt; USD you can get the money to dwolla instantly, which means you can start a bank transfer right away.  Also low trade fees, and no dwolla fees round out the awesomeness.  So i guess the bottom line is that if you use them with dwolla it should go great.

i ran into this as well, my bank told me the iban and swift were both just the routing number, but mtg wouldn't take either.  Also, no one says what the fees will be, except that there will be fees and that small wires are rejected because the fees are more than the wire.

First off i sell below the gox price, but in order to get btc from me you just respond to my ad, and usually i can meet within 10 minutes in our area.  Then you have your fully anonymous (as long as you didn't use anything identifiable with LBC) bitcoins very quickly.  contrast that with:
* open an account
* verify banking info
* fund account
* buy on exchange
there are some services where this is a pretty quick procedure, but it is still on the order of days.  with LBC you can actually have bitcoin in hand within hours (or less).
