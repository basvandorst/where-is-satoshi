I wonder if/how the reward drop will affect the trading price.
@_date: 2012-08-06 17:21:47
That makes sense. Very interesting. So we really shouldn't expect to see too much fluctuation after the reward halves. Most likely we will see a steady rise in price to about the level where it will plateau in december?
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:11:15
Agreed. I've got many singles on order also. I've written several programs and spreadsheets and whatnot checking and cross checking my calculations to make sure my results aren't insane. Truly mind boggling.

Nope! I'm afraid not. :-(

Awesome! Thank you!

Well you don't need to authenticate at all for that info. And I don't know php, but do something like:
    ch_init();
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, '
    // run the query
    $res = curl_exec($ch);
    if ($res === false) throw new Exception('Could not get reply: '.curl_error($ch));
    $dec = json_decode($res, true);
    $price = $dec["bids"][0][0];

Argh! This is driving me nuts! :)
I find myself doing more and more complex stuff, but I have a feeling it's probably pretty simple.

I've created a Go program to fetch the price. I have compiled it for windows so you should be able to run it and get the price. :)

BFL has many, many thousands of orders ahead of you. They *still* haven't shipped and it's been a year since they took the first pre-orders.
If you order now, I would be shocked if you saw your unit before November, if not some time next year.
By the time you get your unit, the difficulty will have risen dramatically.
Let me run my profitability program I wrote.. one sec...
Ok. Assuming today's exchange price with a starting hash rate of 2000TH (just ballparking it), you would break even after about 160 days.
If the exchange rate were to take off, you'd obviously make money much more quickly. However, if you were to purchase bitcoin directly today, you could buy 22 BTC. The above break even point is only 13 bitcoin earned.
Just some info to help your decision.

Damn this second challenge! There's not even a clear objective!
Not quite sure how to approach it. Having a blast though! Thanks for putting this together. :)

Ooh I know what I am going to be trying tomorrow. :-)
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:04:34
Your IP probably falls within a range of IPs that cloudflare has outright blocked due to the DDoS that has been hitting BFL for a while now.
Not sketchy at all, just a greedy algorithm. You can email cloudflare to get it sorted, I'm sure.
@_date: 2013-01-15 16:12:55
Great! Thanks! You should post when/if you get a chance to put in a difficulty increase estimate. Thanks for the great tool!
@_date: 2013-04-04 23:34:46
Within 10%? Fuck that. I had better get every single GH I ordered. 10% below comes out to 60GH lost for me. For someone with a mini rig that will be 150GH lost. Those are significant amounts. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 23:36:13
It seems to return a map of arrays.
So do something like
That should get the first bid in the array, which is the highest bid, and then get the price of that bid
result["bids"][0][1] gives you the volume of coins at that price, it looks like.
No need to filter or query or whatever. Just hit the site, get the whole json object and index into it.
@_date: 2013-05-03 17:16:33
Seriously. I've made some "progress", if you can call it that. I have no idea if what I've managed to do has any implications.
@_date: 2013-04-06 05:00:22
There is no justification, really, I just put in 7TH per week before I saved the file last. You can put in whatever you'd like. 
Really the hash rate is going to start climbing drastically as soon as BFL starts to ship (if they ever do) and continue to rise steadily as they, and others, continue to ship ASIC miners.
@_date: 2013-03-25 06:01:42
I have a feeling this thing will get a block before BFL ships. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:42:27
A while back, I ran the numbers based on various estimates from the various ASIC providers and came to a difficulty estimate of around 28 million sometime between the end of june and the end of july.
Current difficulty is 6,695,826. So I am estimating a 4.2x increase in difficulty.

How does the recipient get their coins? I don't see any instructions in the tweet the bot sends to the recipient.
@_date: 2013-04-25 02:29:04
I figured. I don't even use that wallet anyway. I decided to go the full bitcoin-qt route.
And the password I have is like 80 something characters, so I am pretty sure they won't be able to crack it anyway.

So I'm guessing the wikipedia page on SQL Injection isn't the place to read about it? ;)

Any hints? :P
I'm not too fluent in SQL, unfortunately :(

Yes I've got it all written down and I can see how the input creates an error, but I can't figure out how to exploit it yet. :)
Maybe we should work together? I'll help with the second part? :P haha
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:51:06
Mtgox did change their API actually. I'll update the script and edit my original post with it. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:44:58
In that case I'm sure I'll be **super** helpful! :D
@_date: 2013-04-06 14:10:47
Fine by me. :-)
@_date: 2013-05-03 16:18:01
I'll give it a try for a while. :)
@_date: 2013-01-15 15:22:13
Awesome! I wonder if it estimates difficulty increase over time or if it is just a flat calculation based on current difficulty.
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:30:58
Right. Well I can get errors like jordan314, but not much further than that so far. I am fairly sure I'm escaping, but I can't figure out how to close it again. 
Perhaps it's just too early and I need coffee ;)

A function perhaps?

I did some various searches and whois and whatnot and tried some user/pass combos, but nothing. Also tried SQL injection as well, no dice.
The site sets no cookies and no session variables either.
If brute forcing it isn't going to get us anywhere, then it probably must be some kind of exploit in SQL or PHP.

How about offering it to customers instead? We're the ones who will have to pay more for power.

Any hints to get us started (other than the two found already)? :D

Very nice!
Are you using an HDR image map to cast the light?
The coins look a bit too clean and shiny, I think. Too perfect. Coins are meant to be handled, which inevitably makes them dirty.
I'd pull down the specular and reflectivity a bit, then add a very slight bit of "dirt"... either a procedural or perhaps a 'grit' shader of some kind, like:
 &lt;- this plugin is for lightwave, but it accomplishes the effect I'm talking about, as can been seen in the below image:
The last thing I'd change is make the surface they are sitting on into a wooden table, with a very slight wax polish (reflection) on it.
I feel like these changes could make the image feel more realistic. Obviously this is just the artistic approach I'd take myself. :)
Great work on what you have!
@_date: 2013-06-30 22:55:48
That's correct. You profit is the ratio of what you have to the total, but the total will skyrocket while you're stuck with one machine. As a result, the number of BTC you earn will drop dramatically unless you invest in more power.
