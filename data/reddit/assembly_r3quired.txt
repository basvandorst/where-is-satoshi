What investor of any kind looks at low prices as a bad thing?

Wrong. 
[a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future.](


Demand for gold is neither predictable nor stable, but it's still a store of value. In fact, the safest store of value is actually used in the pricing of nearly EVERY futures contract in existence. It's called the LIBOR rate. 
By your logic, anything that doesn't exactly track the LIBOR rate is not considered a storage of value. That is obviously wrong. 


Because free countries need their constituencies to approve of laws regulating bitcoin. If you are asking for basic economic freedom lessons, they are kind of out of the scope of a reddit reply.

Why? Things aren't true just because you think they are.


Correct. Luckily, the limit to the amount of bitcoins is even more certain than the limit for gold, meaning this does not support your position. 


Ah, so gold was valuable in the middle ages because of the electronic, chemical, and medicinal applications?
That explains all the rich chemists, electrical engineers, and doctors from the middle ages we keep hearing about! 
Just kidding.


Again, something isn't true just because you repeat it often. 


So, the risk of bitcoin becoming banned everywhere is basically the same as the risk of communism spreading across the globe? Seems legit.
