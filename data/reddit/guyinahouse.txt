There is definitely a straight line, everyone empty your savings accounts.
This is it.

I didn't use the word bubble once in my response.
Bitcoin is being held up by speculation, not even the drug trade from SR comes close to supporting the current exchange rate.
The only reason it is so high because people are speculating- that there will be trade later on to support it.
And I'd say you're ignorant if you think BTC is currently worth more than $30, have you see a chart of the worth of BTC? Less than 2 months ago it just broke $50 on this current rocket train.
@_date: 2013-03-29 17:12:25
Yeah, but this was talking about some old guy's retirement.
Edit: nevermind, reading two different stories.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:04:26
I don't think the issue is of bitcoins being killed, but being worth far, far less than the current price.
Which, in all honesty, there isn't enough use other than as speculation to justify the current price.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:13:01
Ask yourself, what is anyone doing with bitcoins? Other than hording them.
And I mean *really* doing with them, someone's etsy store accepting btc or some random crappy internet electronics retailer doesn't count.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:40:33
I put an order in for 50 at 10$ before bitstamp went down.
can't wait
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:46:02
I like how someone downvoted you.
Price hasn't been stable since $10.
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:24:51


Jesus christ, talking to you die hard bitcoin people is pointless.
My original post was asking was if you had an answer as to why you thought the coins were currently worth said price.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:46:58
Me too! and I would.
However, no nutcase can really say btc is worth 200USD currently.
The actual use of the currency is much, much lower. 
@_date: 2013-01-04 18:15:01
Thank you for the information and help, I sent you an email.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:54:18


It's hard to value my love as well, because no one is buying or selling it.
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:02:34
If you aren't posting how we are all going to be millionaires, you can get out
@_date: 2013-04-19 13:24:27
I'd say mean would be $30 range. If you look at a 6 month chart, all these straight up gains happened at about $50.
How long have we actually had a price above the 30$ range? 
Two months.
The price that could possibly be supported by the amount of actual use of bitcoins, not just investor speculation, which oddly enough got tons of steam in the last two months.
I wish it would just tank to $30 so I can have bitcoins and use them, rather than convert fiat only exactly when I want to use bitcoins, for fear of having them devalue by a someone's pump and dump/DDoS scam on the exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:29:47
Yes, I agree. 
But that is what makes it speculation currently. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:32:50
60 on btce 80 on bitstamp.
Glad I sold when I woke up!
@_date: 2013-04-02 22:37:07
Is there a subreddit where everyone doesn't act like nothing can go wrong with bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:46:49
Because you're looking at a forum of people who are blinded by money.
IT CANT BE WRONG! Look, this shitty website selling rice earings is accepting bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:33:45
This is also based off year old data, that may not even be accurate since it wasn't officially released by SR.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:14:52
You don't seem to understand what crash means.

This just in, high risk investments pay high rewards if successful.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:06:42
There isn't anything wrong with the system. It just isn't worth 100-200$ a coin.
I wouldn't be surprised if it goes to 10.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:08:24
I feel like a lot of these people who act like nothing can go wrong with bitcoin forget that everyone doesn't get to cash out at the most expensive price, if everyone decides to cash out at once.
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:25:44
Not really, last study of SR was over a year ago
@_date: 2013-01-04 14:01:25
Thank you for the detailed response.
The funds showed up in my instawallet while pending, then as soon as they weren't spending, they moved.
Though, now that you say I shouldn't have sent support my wallet ID I have a feeling even if there was something they could do support is now 140 btc richer.
Guess this is a mistake I won't make again.
Do you have suggestions for a more secure wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:14:34
can you stand to lose $1000 instantly and be ok?
bitcoin is the equivalent of penny stocks.
pure speculation
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:09:40
Because he isn't delusional and realizes in the present there is nothing, other than speculation, currently holding up the price of BTC above $30.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:00:08
HEY THERE ARE REAL BUSINESSES USING BITCOIN.
MY MOTHER IS SELLING HER RICE JEWELRY FOR BITCOINS ON ETSY
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:54:13
Can you stand to lose all of that money instantly and not be in a bad financial position?
@_date: 2013-03-28 13:16:38


Are you saying security wise, like someone is going to attempt to steal them from someone's block chain wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-19 14:11:22
I agree, but as a useful currency- 
Why would I buy anything today if my bitcoins will be worth 2x the value in a few days?
or the flip side
Why would I buy bitcoins if I have to risk losing half the value of them in a few days?
This makes adoption very unattractive.
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:38:25
hindsight 20/20, it is so clear!
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:04:48


I don't think you understand what speculation means.
You can't directly pay bills or anyone who isn't set up to accept bitcoins. I can't go on amazon and tell them I want to pay in bitcoins, I have to go through bitpay or whatever. So, basically I can convert my cash to coins, to convert them back to cash to pay someone.
There is currently no real use for bitcoins.
The reason the price goes up because people are speculating that it will become adopted.
If no one else adopted bitcoin from this day forward, would you think that BTC price would stay at $150?
If your answer is no, then you're agreeing that the price is inflated by speculation.
If you say yes, please tell me what major companies are supporting it.
@_date: 2013-01-03 23:08:09
Thank you for the reply, this is the first time this has happened and I was freaking out!
I guess I wait.
@_date: 2013-05-18 17:36:50
This is sarcasm, right?
According to that post someone who invested 6k in August would have a million in profits. 
@_date: 2013-01-04 01:29:55
I just looked on and it looks like someone somehow sent my money to another address.
It was 140 BTC, and 7 got sent to some new address and 133 got send to another new address.
I don't know how someone did that the instant I had my money released, not to mention the second after I sent 1 btc to my actual account that received the 1 btc.
I'm hoping it is some freak error.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:52:36
Ok, now show me a real business that is spending them.
No one who isn't techn savvy is spending bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:52:37
I'm waiting for the panic sell when mtgox comes online.
I wouldn't risk buying anything until then.
@_date: 2013-05-24 17:40:23
It is like people have forgotten about that mountain climb ride to 260 usd/btc rate, where everyone is feverishly buying in thinking an investment could sustain paying crazy gains over a period of months.
@_date: 2013-03-29 14:00:07
Anyone who is slightly intelligent wouldn't have put 750k dollars just chilling in a bank account.
The federal deposit insurance is 250k per banking institution, there are at a minimum 8 different banks near my college town. I could have 250k insured at each one.
This also doesn't include the many ways, if you're married and have a child, that you could potentially have 3 million federally insured at a single institution.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:20:27


I'll give you a hint, the stable price isn't above 300, or 200, or even 100.

I love how it is now ASICMINER that is causing all the "omg if I only invested I'd be rich thing".
Just like the bubble when bitcoin went to 260. It would be funny to see the same thing happen here.
@_date: 2013-04-08 11:49:02
This is an absolute garbage post.
No facts, just someone blinded by the money.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:43:39
Honestly, unless you can afford to lose every single dollar you put in, you shouldn't put any money in.
As before, even more so now.
There will be more panic sells, all the markets just stopped moving.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:02:43
how come?
don't they make money bc of the fee?
@_date: 2013-04-03 11:30:26
That is exactly why.
I'd bet 80% of everyone who is recently registering and buying bitcoins is doing so because of the skyrocketing prices.
Even my completely technologically illiterate friends have been hearing about the skyrocketing price of BTC and want in, on making money on investing in it.
They don't give a fuck about it being an actual currency, or even know anything about it.
Which I'd also attribute to those 80% I mentioned.
@_date: 2013-04-19 14:10:16


I agree that is doesn't matter, but when you have wild swings up or down it makes using the money very unattractive.
Why would I buy anything today if my bitcoins will be worth 2x the value in a few days?
or the flip side
Why would I buy bitcoins if I have to risk losing half the value of them in a few days?
@_date: 2013-04-19 13:31:52
IMO, until another big crash, there are still plenty of speculators trying to get in because they see this as their chance, as they missed their chance a bunch of times on the rocket ride to 260.
I'd also imagine the second time there is a devaluation like that, that there will hopefully be a more stable price as everyone who thought it was their chance will have been run out.
$1 or $500, I'd just like it to not move by a ridiculous point amount in a day.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:37:20
*because you believe you'll get rich off it
Eat, pay your bills, don't jump on this train to lose your money in the bubble.

Do you have any sources?
@_date: 2013-04-03 11:35:37
Posts like this, and just about every other post in this forum, are what make me believe this is a bubble, far more than the crazy spike in prices.
What other investment causes people to say because of appreciation you only spent $1200, PRAISE BITCOIN.
No, it cost roughly $30,000. He/she gave up the value of cashing those coins in. (which means he paid $42,000, 12,000 extra, since the price just sky rocketed, again)
I  wasn't around for the great depression, but I'd imagine if there was a bitcoin reddit, everyone would be as rabbidly talking about their stocks that are making them millionaires because they purchased them three months ago.
People have absolute 0 incentive to buy anything right now, other than taking one for the team to promote btc.
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:08:20

Kind of like when Oprah Winfrey gave everyone in her audience a brand new car on her show.
The IRS didn't just go, "I can't take 20% of that car! Guess you get it tax free."
No, they'll make you either A- pay them or B- sell the car to pay the taxes.

It is a dream, you're absolutely blinded if you think anything appreciates this fast and doesn't fall.
Feel free to reference the history of just about anything.
@_date: 2013-04-03 11:39:52


There isn't any need for bitcoins, though.
Just because you can buy someone's homemade rice jewelry on etsy, does not mean there is demand.
There is only demand because people *want* in the same sense a toy becomes collectible.
Once no one wants to collect (invest), they will be worthless.
The price is FAR ahead of bitcoin's actual worth.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:05:19
If you're bad with money, don't go gambling it on bitcoins.
You should instead save it, which would be being smart with money.

I'd like to hear why you think bitcoin is worth 240 (or even 100) to USD right now.
I'm guessing because you can shop at a shitty version of amazon is why?
