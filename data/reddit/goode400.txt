I'm on! See bronze goblins at 4a4c8776085c67e75aa277f1224ce367f70f4ab8
@_date: 2016-04-16 08:07:15
These are pretty cool!  :-)
@_date: 2016-04-05 17:22:25
Same here. Any luck yet?
@_date: 2015-12-14 18:23:56
I do...but nobody wants to buy for bitcoin! 
@_date: 2015-12-06 10:42:15
I just tried this, (bought a great track for 7p (UK)) and can confirm that it's a very smooth experience.
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:34:58
It's  thanks.
@_date: 2014-01-18 13:31:10
signed up! bronze sculptures from UK. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:14:21
Me too! I was annoyed at the time!
@_date: 2014-03-09 10:41:04
If setting businesses up to accept bitcoin became a valued service, soon loads of people would be doing it, just like in the 90's with websites.
@_date: 2014-03-14 16:08:33
I sell sculptures but I haven't sold any for bitcoins yet :-(
@_date: 2014-01-23 11:10:55
Uh - yes there is.
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:39:02
What are you talking about? I'm not 'investing', I'm sending a tenner to someone who has worked unpaid on something that has the potential to stick two fingers up to a company who are acting against everything their founder stood for. If he goes out and spends it on beer, good for him.

I was looking into this. It seems that only printers with a hard drive are a cause for concern.
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:54:08
@_date: 2014-04-02 17:58:41
Yes. I'm stinging for my losses, but I'm buying.
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:03:31
Sent you a donation. Good luck with the project. It would be so cool if thousands of people started using this on their iphones. One in the eye for the control freaks at apple!
@_date: 2014-03-14 16:13:25
Thanks. I tried to sign up and all went well until I was asked to choose my location from USA or Africa!
@_date: 2014-04-12 08:41:43
Welcome! 
@_date: 2014-03-01 13:13:57
Welcome! Happened to me too, but I still think we'll be happy in the long run.
@_date: 2014-01-18 17:17:24
There's nowhere to add my web site address and the 'contact store' link doesn't work.
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:31:32
Welcome! I use localbitcoins and have never had a problem. I recommend posting a trade rather than buying from the 'buy bitcoins online' section. You may have to wait a bit but you can get a better price.
I am buying at the moment. It feels like a good time to buy....but who knows??
@_date: 2014-01-13 06:31:30
This is it.  
It would be great to see an article in the Oxford Times about the first Oxford pub to accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:09:56
very well done for going to see them. Sorry you didn't get your coins back. Best of luck.
@_date: 2014-02-02 20:10:10
Would work well for pubs but not so well for shoe shops, etc!
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:57:09
Yay! Just bought a waffle maker for btc! Thank you bitcoin bazaar and good luck!
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:46:08
Tried to fill out the form but got this error on the 'town' field:
The value '689' is invalid.
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:49:54
I like it! 
@_date: 2014-03-14 08:56:45
Good idea. Looks like there is an Oxford bitcoin meetup group
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:03:16
Bought all my coins on localbitcoins. Never had a problem and avoided being goxed.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:50:43
Too crippled to write a blog post? Has the snow brought down the internet?

@_date: 2014-01-11 08:57:06
Great news! I also live in Oxford and would be delighted to buy my first bitcoin pint. Where is your pub?
@_date: 2014-04-02 11:50:52
Although I'm a big fan of bitcoin, I couldn't help a wry smile at this.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:11:13
Sent! Nice one Andreas.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:55:45
Shouldn't the MT.GOX exchange now be removed from the markets.blockchain.info site?
@_date: 2014-02-08 11:49:43
If you use localbitcoins you can set the price you want to pay by posting a trade. This is slower but you can get a better deal than just going to the 'buy bitcoins' section.
@_date: 2014-02-10 08:39:59
a beer in my local pub.
@_date: 2014-01-11 18:56:33
..Found it! The Oxford Blue on Marston St. Great to meet you Chris! Make sure the staff are all briefed as I'll be bringing my mates for a few bitcoin pints soon!
@_date: 2015-05-07 16:00:37
love it!
@_date: 2014-10-31 09:53:53
The bitcoin donation option needs to be more visible. I only found it by returning to this page and seeing alukeonlife's post.
@_date: 2014-10-31 09:38:22
Just donated. Come on people. This needs to be a success story!
@_date: 2015-01-31 16:56:08
They aren't on coinmap. Someone should tell them. Couldn't find contact details on their web page.
@_date: 2015-05-01 16:42:36
I love the idea of a P2P exchange but I don't understand how the fiat side of it works. The trade gets split up into X mini trades with my deposit securing each one. Does that mean I have to make X individual transfers from my bank account? or do I transfer the whole amount to somewhere where the micro payments are handled? and if so, how is that not a trusted third party?
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:33:53
I'm also buying. 15 coins in the last 24 hours. Funny how all the  'you're crazy!' comments come now but were thin on the ground in November 2014.
@_date: 2016-03-02 09:11:46
5 items on there now.
@_date: 2017-02-09 06:53:12
A *cash* ISA may pay 1%. A stocks and shares ISA pays whatever the stocks and shares pay, so a bitcoin ISA would grow with the bitcoin price. The advantage would be that you wouldn't have to pay capital gains tax on the gain.
@_date: 2016-03-02 07:57:57
YAY! Thanks guys. My first item is up for sale on OB. (search 'bronze') I'll give a 50% discount to the first buyer. Loads of other pieces available, I just haven't added them yet.  David Goode. Sculptor

You people who tell someone in this situation that he's an idiot, moron, etc, really need to take a long look at yourselves. 
LostCoinsKickingSelf - I don't use changetip, but I sent you a small consolation to your return wallet. Bet I'm not the only one. We're not all empathy free scumbags out here. Good luck

Just like 'hodl', 'this is gentlemen' originated from a mistake. Somebody meant to write 'this is it, gentlemen'.

Yes I have. It's a great novel and a graphic description of the shaky ground that our entire financial world is built on.

I remember a post like this right near the bottom, in 2015. I often wonder about that guy, and how he felt when it went to 100 x his exit price.

There is someone who says this every single time we have a dip. 'I sold at x and bought back in at x-20%'

The only thing I know for sure about all this is my own sentiment. I have had some fiat sitting on an exchange with a buy order, waiting for 'the bottom' for a long time now. Since this latest drop, I have been getting more and more stressed about potentially missing the bottom so I caved in and cancelled my buy order (set at $3300) and bought at the current rate. I don't think I'm unique. I think there are millions like me, watching the chart and really feeling the fomo. We may all be 'idiots', but we are a very real, very large influence on this market.
@_date: 2018-11-27 08:06:16
Yep. I helped a few sellers to get out in 2015 too.  :-)
@_date: 2018-11-24 09:10:08

I did search quite extensively, but I could not find an answer to this question. Apologies if I missed something obvious. Would you or anybody care to answer or share a link to the answer?

With a bit more reading I see that the majority of loans are not denominated in btc. As a lender, this means that I would effectively be selling my coins rather than storing them and gaining interest - so, again, I would be loosing out in the event of a big upswing.
@_date: 2015-04-24 06:35:00
Wouldn't a huge btc price increase like November 2013 cause chaos and massive defaulting at btcjam? Any profits made by a lender would be wiped out by not holding their coins during the upswing....or am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:14:22
but if I wait until they are ready, I will have to split the coins myself, which would mean waiting for 'electrum 2X', or whatever it will be called. By the time that is ready, one of the forks may have lost 90% of its value.
@_date: 2015-04-24 09:12:21
Care to elaborate on the hard lessons?
@_date: 2015-04-29 19:22:41
What for?
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:55:09
Wouldn't it be better to have your coins on Bitfinex so that they are split and ready to sell the moment trading is allowed? Seems like waiting for custom wallet software could result in a big missed opportunity....or am I misunderstanding something?
@_date: 2016-05-07 11:41:01
That's exactly what I was thinking. Half the supply and then factor in people holding off from selling while they see what happens....
@_date: 2015-10-17 13:38:40
...and if you buy less than £40 a day, you can do it on a card without giving any other verification.

My wife and I are laughing out loud at this! I did give out paper wallets, but 1 bitcoin each to my student kids who were over the moon. I would never have done it to the rest of my family!
