And decimals are points for a reason, 1.333 is 1[stop/whole unit] AND some fraction of a unit.  Commas in numbers don't mean anything and don't make you stop or signify whole units, just kind of keep places of how many powers of tens you're currently looking at

In my layman's opinion he wasn't guilty of anything except possibly seeking a hitman for murdering someone.  That's the only crime committed... as long as he wasn't buying/selling illegal substances himself.  Creating a platform in which people are able to launder money or exchange illicit/illegal things and services is not a crime.  He would be seen as a service provider and protected as such (if any of his servers were in the US though, he'd have to obey any subpoenas for user information but not if he doesn't keep those anywhere!)

I had mined a good handful of coins back in late 2009 but gave up on them after they wouldn't get over $8 or so, last year I put everything I still had keys for into coinbase and bought some ASICs on Bitmit.  Found bitcointalk and since I had such good luck on Bitmit, figured the community had matured a lot since 2009.  I posted on there that I needed a 49-port USB hub and he messaged me asking for an offer and we haggled and then sent him the 0.6. No further communication.  Sucks, but not as much as the 5btc wallet key I put on a hidden share of my home NAS that I deleted and journaled over a year later (2010) when I thought btc was dead.

No, with less new BTC generation, the incentive to mine will be reduced, so more transactions will need to be incentivized with transaction fees.  Right now it's only 0.1BTC because there aren't enough transactions to have to prioritize them very much but as the network grows and more transactions are happening, companies will have to tip more and more to get that transaction on the next upcoming block.

All this tells me is that people are holding onto their BTC cause they don't want to tip someone the equivalent of $9,000 a couple years from now (and who could blame them?).

Stock split doesn't actually create or get rid of shares, just pre-divides them on paper (for all current holders).  Splits don't affect the market cap, just divvys it up into smaller chunks.  A 1:10 stock split would be the same as if we shifted BTC's decimal to the right one to make the entire market be 210 million instead of 21 million, and all current holders would just have 10x the amount of "coin" and they'd be worth 1/10th the price.  Each block would be giving 250 BTC instead of 25 but it's all just cheaper since already been divided by 10 once.

Theoretically, BTC could hit $1mil or more, but that's only if we're using satoshis on the network to move around or anchor large amounts of fiat.  Like if multiple countries or the whole EU anchored their denominations to small amounts of BTC.  If out of the 21mil units, only 5-10mil were accessible after we writeoff all the lost coins, then I could see it being partitioned by the thousands of BTC and a lot less volatility.

No, you would still have free transactions for non-commercial use (payments to friends, remittances, etc) but it might take a couple blocks before it hits the blockchain.  But businesses, restaurants, etc will pay the 0.0001 or whatever to make sure it's in the next block.

Inflation insures that money today is worth less tomorrow, a dollar tomorrow isn't as good as a dollar today.  T-Bills are just the absolute baseline of this.  Burying a dollar in the backyard for 10 years actually loses value, but buying a T-Bill for 10 years locks whatever value in (doesn't grow in relative terms to anything else, but it should be keeping up with inflation).
So as long as the T-bills were priced at whatever inflation actually ended up being (or less), then the debt costs nothing or govt. actually came out ahead in the deal.

I still like the idea of only upping it to only 8MB or so and partitioning the block-size into free/very low-fee, average, and paid/high-priority segments.  Think of it as a bell-shaped curve: lowest 5% (size) of the block just grabs as many pending 0 miner fee (lowest priority) transactions just so they don't accumulate a huge backlog.  These free transactions can take up to half a day to settle during all non-peaktime blocks.  The middle 80-95% are for all the transactions paying an average/modest fee and will go through in 1-2 blocks.  Finally the last X% are the highest fees and almost guaranteed to be on the current block.  Maybe have 5% reserved initially but allow it to take another 5% from the middle segment if necessary or drop to 0% size if there aren't any current high-bidders

As the amount of miners decreases, your chances of solving a block increases (but so does the time it takes for the network to solve a block... until the difficulty is adjusted).  So it equals out, as long as you're at least breaking even on low $200 coins.  The problem is ROI'ing on the miners you already have, cause if difficulty doesn't fall as much as the price has, and it's not profitable for you to mine $200 coins now, your hardware may never break-even.  Unless you can shut it down for a week or two and buy coins with the electricity you save and ride the wave back up to a point where you can turn your miners back on but that's also risky if prices don't surge back in the next 2 weeks.

If the major exchanges/wallets handle and group payments to/from each other it would be easy to consolidate a lot.  Just like how the majority of Coinbase transactions are off-blockchain cause they occur between their own customers.  So if they can group all the transactions to Bitpay and other large companies with a lot of customers, they can lump them together every few minutes instead of being instant.
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:21:18
Yeah at first I thought it'd be nice if pending transactions with no fees associated would just gain priority over time for each block they missed out on, but that would force miners to become a charity and take a slot from someone who is willing to pay a fee.  I still think 8MB is fine for the next couple years since much of the US is still connected with very slow internet, but as that infrastructure builds out and improves (and BTC adoption grows) you can also increase the blocksize again but having it be too flexible doesn't restrict supply/increase demand any so people won't pay the 0.5-1% fee that miners will be needing as the reward drops to 12BTC and below.
Edit: And remember, Visa is paying each merchant directly so their TPS is a lot higher but if we have merchants using Coinbase or Bitpay most transactions will be off-blockchain and they would just settle between the different exchanges every 1 or 2 blocks as a single transaction.
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:32:00
Treechains are kindof what Coinbase and Bitpay are already doing, right?  They take all the transactions and immediately settle the ones that are internal, and group the external ones together so that when a number of coinbase people are paying bitpay people, they are lumped together as one transaction and then the recipient just divvys that back up to the correct individual
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:27:39
What about this?  Have two partitions on each block... an ASAP priority one capped at 2MB or whatever, but is reserved for only transactions over 10BTC (or whatever threshold, can be adjusted over time) and will obviously grant larger miner fees just on percentage alone.  Then a more lenient 6MB cap of all the day-to-day purchases to-from individuals and are probably not paying much of a miner fee so aren't really guaranteed to be on the very next block.  That way if you want to guarantee your personal transaction goes through on the current or upcoming block, you have to pony up a good miner fee to get yourself at the top of the 6MB free-for-all segment, or be like a bank/exchange/clearinghouse who can lump a few transactions together as a single one every few minutes and get into the priority segment.

Scarcity of blocksize is what would create demand though.  2mb reserved for large transactions (either individuals purchasing expensive things or clearinghouses that are lumping together transactions between exchanges/online wallets/etc).  If you have a large transaction and are forced to be in that smaller partition, you would have to pay at least a small % miner fee to squeeze in there.  And then if you have a smaller transaction you might or might not have to put a miner fee on unless it's during peak hours or whatever.  And maybe allow those smaller transactions to overflow into the 2mb partition if it's not filling up, BUT NOT ALLOW large transactions to overflow into the larger partition.  So this would also save size.  At minimum it would be 2mb (everyone lumped into the 2mb cause there aren't enough to cap it), at maximum it would be 8mb

Also, do you guys think the difficulty will level off or slow up once all the GPU's drop out?  I know they only account for 8-10% of the market (if that) but if they all stop, and no more cheap/readily available alternatives like the USB block erupters come out... we might get back to a &lt;20% difficulty increase every 2016 blocks

Don't feel too bad, In 2011 when I mined with a few spare graphics cards in a few spare desktops I had laying around, I got discouraged and quit after making 5BTC in a couple months... but that was when BTC = $8-12/piece so I thought it wasn't worth it.  I should've kept going.  We're still pretty early on, when 1BTC is 500-1000 USD, you'll be fine.  Just don't sell your BTC, or day trade with them.

Newegg, Microcenter, Frys, and Amazon.

My bot via API isn't connected either.  At least I took out 50% of my holdings from BTC-E a few days ago.

2) correct, if you invest in ones like this that are tied to MtGox-USD then you can get paid back less BTC than you gave if BTC-USD increased more than the interest rate.  But most of the BTCjam loans aren't tied to USD so you get strictly BTC+interest back regardless of what the BTC-USD price did in the meantime.

As the block payouts decrease to 10, 5, etc... the transaction fees will start making up a higher percentage of what the miners get to share.  If people aren't getting a return, they'll turn off their miners, and the difficulty will decrease.  Once we hit the 21Million outstanding coins, the miners will ONLY be getting the transaction fees but even that might still be profitable based on the volume and price of BTC
