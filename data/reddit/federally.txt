A lot like fiat then, just in the other direction

I feel like this statement directly contradicts Gresham's Law

The Federal Reserve's started goal is to have a controlled inflation of the USD. If everything goes perfectly to their plan the USD will lose 2% of value annually.
Any increase in purchasing power of the USD dollar is very short term and only on relation to other fiat currencies. 
Can't really argue with the fact the dollar has lost 98% of its purchasing power in the last 100 years.

Sorry bud but mercantilism didn't die, it evolved into fascism and it's alive and well in the US.

I think my definition of "economist" and theirs differ wildly

At this point I'm being rather irresponsible and holding all my BTC, about 1.5 BTC, in my wallet on my phone. As it's super easy to spend from there.
Though I'm going to be setting up an offline paper wallet soon to hold the bulk of my BTC as I continue to buy.

I'm not naively optimistic. I'm fully aware that BTC could crash and burn.
However I want it to succeed and I'm willing to express this support financially.

I have scheduled buys on every pay day.
I never sell, though I do spend them sometimes, not nearly at the rate I'm buying though.

Oh of course. 
I've already gone through the process of restoring my wallet after I bricked my phone.
It's really easy to do what i'm doing safely.
