You really are stupid. That's the setup, he's banking on someone taking the initiative (or have someone/alternative account do so), then he posted his wallet address.

It takes years of education and experience for the mechanic or dentist to be able to tell you what's wrong with your car or teeth, and they charge you a fee.
The person who you were replying to basically googled Apple's market cap and the amount of bitcoins in circulation for you and gave you the formula for free. All you had to do was open your calculator app and punch in 925,000,000,000 / 17,809,000 to get your answer.
People can spoonfeed you, but you still have to do the chewing yourself sometimes.

Let's say Bitcoin becomes a one world currency 50, 100 or 200 years down the line. How would it affect trade?
@_date: 2018-09-03 05:32:48
That's like what, 0.6% of the bitcoins mined? Would it really crash the value even if the guy dumped everything at once? The market is volatile compared to stocks but if a shareholder sold 1%  or even 10% of a 100 billion dollar company, it's not going to tank the value, not for the long term anyway. I hope he does dump them, and if the market tanks, I'll pick up more bitcoins.

I set it up once, and purposely entered the wrong pin 3 times to set it up again. Is that the way to do it? Maybe I was just paranoid, but there was a tiny smudge on the instruction manual, so I was playing it safe.

So my Ledger Nano S just arrived, I've set everything up but just realized that my pin screen is different from the picture on their website:
Mine has 8 digits, but it looks like it should only have 4? I got my nano s from LedgerWallet.com, so it should be legit, right?

It doesn't make sense that they would pay possibly hundreds of people $4000 for beta testing.  It would cost them a cool half million for 125 testers.
@_date: 2018-05-09 05:12:04
Would it be wise to have a hardware wallet and an Android wallet at the same time?  I just bought a Ledger Nano S and am planning to store almost all of my Bitcoins on that, and then maybe around $500 to $1000 worth of Bitcoin on Mycelium for spending. I was thinking that if my software wallet gets hacked, then my hardware wallet would still be secured.
Quick question, if I transfer btc between my hardware and software wallet, the chances of my hardware wallet bring hacked is pretty low, right?
Sorry for being long winded but I'd be super grateful for any answers. Thank you!
@_date: 2018-05-20 11:20:56
Don't know what that means, but I probably got trolled.
The passphrase:
"Attack early first person who find seed code will almost obtain Bitcoin" is led me to an empty wallet as well.
Maybe it's trolls, or maybe the passphrase is actually more words, and that passphrase as part of it.
@_date: 2018-05-09 05:33:41
Thank you for your answer. I think that's what I will do. Buying my first couple of Bitcoins from an exchange today. Super nervous.
@_date: 2018-05-20 06:38:53
It's probably something simple, like the 12 words inside the 2 holes in the B. I don't know how to use recovery phrase to recover the seed, but good luck everyone.
@_date: 2018-05-09 06:38:19

LOL. I accidentally found someone's passphrase for their wallet. I think it's an inactive wallet and has no coins or transactions on it.
**"attack early first person that find seed code will easily obtain coin"**

Whatever, dude. I don't even know how to make one, my ledger's passphrase is randomized, I didn't even know you can make one yourself.

So the Bitcoin exchange (ANX Pro) that I use in Hong Kong has stopped taking money deposits since late August, they're saying it's a system upgrade but I don't really believe them. Should I be concerned about buying and selling (now and in the future) on this particular exchange? I can't really think of any reason as to why they would stop taking cash deposits. It's frustrating because I want to buy more now during this dip but I can't do so.

Sorry to hear, OP.
Would it be safer to have 2 wallets? One to keep most of your coins in, and another one for small transactions? And then just transfer funds in between your two wallets?
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:25:10
Yeah, I think I was confused. I actually got the app from the bitcoin.org website. I remember downloading the Bitcoin and mycelium wallets but uninstalled the mycelium one because it didn't support non US credit cards.

Yeah, the official bitcoin.com app. I guess I'll pick another one then. Cheers.

It happens. My credit card info got stolen once (god damn OnePlus website), got a 3 fraudulent charges from someone in Russia booking hotel rooms. Luckily I get an SMS message whenever there's an online transaction and I wasn't overseas, so I called the bank right after and got them reversed. Now I only use PayPal or Google Pay online.

It takes time to talk to the family, research how to buy and safely store your BTC, open an account on an exchange, complete the KYC process, and/or wait for your hardware wallet to arrive.  It'll probably take 3 to 5 days for people to get in the game and start buying after watching the segment, 7 to 10 days if they order a hardware wallet first.

The Bitcoin ATMs around my area have terrible rates, together with the buyers fee I would have to pay a 12 to 13% premium. I would only use one if I suddenly went broke and needed to sell my BTC in a pinch to put food on the table.
@_date: 2019-05-20 05:56:43
Once the first few wallets get cracked by a quantum computer, BTC's value would free fall. The person who hacked it would probably not make that much money from it. The only worry is someone wanting to destroy BTC having the ability to do so before there are safeguards in place.

Lucky you. Here in Hong Kong, if Bitcoin hits a million USD, you would need 3 bitcoins to buy a 3 bedroom apartment in a building that's less than 30 years old. If and when it hits a million, the property value would have gone up more already, so I'd be lucky to get a 700 sqft 2 bedroom unit in a newish apartment building.
