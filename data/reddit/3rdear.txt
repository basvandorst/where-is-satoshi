You're backpedaling. Your OP suggests "stability through security" as "the goal" (your words, not mine), not merely "a goal" or one goal out of many. Both security and stability are qualities or "goals" of any payment system, regardless of whether it is trust-based or not.

The thing that solves the issue of trust in bitcoin is cryptographic proof. Security is a byproduct and function of the number of honest nodes which "collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes."

I always thought the goal of bitcoin, at least according to the whitepaper, was to solve "the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model."

Shift FAQ says only users in certain states can spend via Coinbase. When will this be extended to MI and OH?

One paper copy written by hand and placed in a safe. I live alone, so unless someone has been breaking into my home and replacing everything with an exact replica, they didn't get it from there.

Actually, it's more like being in the passenger seat or backseat of said Hummer after it has already gone off the cliff. Most of the fellow passengers who are along for the ride believe that changing drivers now will change the inevitable outcome.

Representing my needs to Congress is a futile effort regardless of who is doing it. Anyone begging Congress to be nice is only evidence that Congress has them right where they want them. Stop asking for permission. It sends the wrong message.

I never said they were "lost." I said they were "jacked." I can certainly see the address where they ended up.

I wonder how long this has been going on? I wonder if this is how my coin got stolen when I posted about it here?

I also have the bitWallet app on my phone. I've been in contact with them, too. So that is another place where the private key existed, regardless of having enabled every security feature the app provides.

It's possible, but not probable since I only go to blockchain via the same method every time.
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:18:07
It was an online wallet at blockchain.info

While the individual does share some responsibility, I also place a lot of blame on people like Bill Gates. Not knowing much about security is a problem that is inherent in having long-insecure operating systems pre-installed on most personal computers and making it too easy for every monkey and his grandmother to have a computer let alone be on the internet. Poor security has practically been socially engineered into the Windows monoculture. Good security is a process, not a thing. People need to be better educated on security from the beginning.

Yes I have opened a support ticket, but the most I could get out of them so far have been questions about my PC and software, how I access their system, and the support agent saying "Sorry you lost your bitcoin." :-/

I feel for ya, bro. Lookie here:

It had only been used for my stuff. Newer machine, Linux OS installed from live cd. If I downloaded anything sketchy it happened behind the scenes. The only real downloads I've initiated have been the typical nix updates. ClamAV is the anti-virus I'm using at the moment.

Also, the Joomla shopping cart extension, HikaShop, released an update with a payment plugin for BitPay the other day.

In the U.S., another thing which guarantees demand for government currency are the government's own legal tender laws compelling people to accept Federal Reserve Notes as payment for debts.

They are totally nonchalant about it. The problem you describe here is most likely what happened in my case.
@_date: 2016-02-03 16:09:07
It has happened to me before. I no longer use Blockchain.info.
@_date: 2015-11-07 22:57:51
No, I wasn't storing coins on that machine. At the time of the theft, what was stolen was in a web wallet at Blockchain.info that I was accessing from that machine. I was also doing some trading between cryptocurrencies at an exchange in the UK that has since gone under. I no longer use that machine for dealing with bitcoin and I no longer use Blockchain.info, either. All my other bitcoin is in offline wallets.

Hmmmm ...

Yes, that's where I found the comments that it's malware.
@_date: 2015-10-20 13:18:43
Perhaps what they really mean is "borderless."

Both clamav and Comodo say the system is currently clean, but I suppose there is always a chance that both scanners will miss something, though according to virustotal.com, Comodo was flagging it as Unclassified Malware as of 6/14/2014.

I might be interested. I'm an audio engineer and an articulate one at that. So at least my contributions will sound good. Plus, I already read a lot of those sites already. I'm just not sure I actually have time to devote to making my reading time into reading AND recording time. Do you have an idea of how much one might earn?
