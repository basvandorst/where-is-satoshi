An easy way to acquire bitcoin, for one. If you're unbanked (for some reason this word annoys me) you aren't getting on any btc/fiat exchanges are you? And not everyone has a way to buy them in person either. Even me living in the US, I live in Maine and the closest cash seller listed on localbitcoins is &gt;100miles away.

OP logic.
@_date: 2014-03-15 22:04:42
I would go with a paper wallet ( or any physical medium you can get your private keys onto ) stored in a safe/safety deposit box/underground in the desert.
Edit -- To do this correctly you need to make sure the address they are stored on is not compromised in any way ( malware or your computer etc ) and afterwords wipe the drive completely, such that even if you are compromised at a later date the addresses can not be recovered by an attacker.

The larger the block is the longer it takes to broadcast to the network, slightly increasing the chances that your block may get orphaned.
Since the loss in fees is completely dwarfed by the loss if you orphan a block, many pools only include very high priority transactions.

You can just change where the decimal point is placed. Right now a block reward is 25.00000000 and the value is (roughly) $450.00 USD. Could easily change that to be a block reward of 25000.000000 and a value/btc of $0.45 USD.
Magic, now there is 21,000,000,000,000 bitcoins. If we don't want to change that, then people need to just get over the mental block of using integer multiple of the base unit as their only reference point.

You can encrypt the private keys with a known passphrase and then store multiple copies of it in your household/wherever. To spend them you need to import the private key into any wallet.
Change happens when you make a transaction that doesn't use all of your BTC. If you have 1 btc and want to pay .1 btc, you include all of the available btc from whichever address are part of the input, send me .1 and send yourself the remaining .9 to newly a newly generated address. Bitcoin-qt and blockchain.info handle this seamlessly for you.

How about some portion of the transaction fees? In the long term, when the block reward goes to 0 there would once again be no incentive to run a full node. Could also be combined with some small portion of the block reward.

QR Codes are the same thing as a wallet address, they just make for a simple way to input the address into your clients wallet.
If you're just getting into bitcoin and aren't going to handle large amounts of money I would suggest a webwallet such as [blockchain.info's](
As for mobile/desktop. It's basically the same, pick whichever works better for your clients/business.

Why make a blockchain spamming transaction to login when you could just use a challenge/response protocol. 
Client : "Hi, I'm 1TeKnovqy4nqJDim3FQLudLSWWLZfF2Aq please let me log in"
Server : "Sure thing, sign the following message [timestamp][nonce][address]"
Client : "Here you go [blahhhhhhhblahblah]"

Paper wallets are mostly for cold storage. You get massively increased security if careful.
If you have a reasonable amount of BTC and don't plan on spending some portion of it, keep it on paper.

Possibly, it depends on how the merchant feels about the risk of 0 confirmation transactions. When it comes to a $10 salad or whatever, this would probably work perfectly.

Wouldn't this be much more expensive to do with bitcoin ( transactions need to be bigger than 5500 satoshi ) or require an off-blockchain solution ( changetip. )

If the world economy collapses good luck keeping your internet connection that makes bitcoin viable.
Ignoring that caveat it would probably skyrocket the price of cryptos (assuming at some point before the collapse the spread of awareness about btc/cryptocurrencies was large enough)

* No wallet addresses in posts/comments. The tipbot can be used.
* Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
