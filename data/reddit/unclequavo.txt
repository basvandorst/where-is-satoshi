Nothing wrong with spreading your investment across many promising projects. Many would not advise to go all in on bitcoin or one project in general, but its up to you and your research :)

They’ve been shouting its a bubble even before it hit $1000. I think those who haven’t invested and continue to preach this are just simply too nervous to buy in case the price does dip. But in that case, why wouldn’t they buy more? 
HODL and to the moon my friends!

Its going to keep growing considering the huge attention its gaining on the news. A few times a week its on Australian prime time news. More and more will begin to buy various coins, not just bitcoin. Its a great time to buy whenever you are comfortable and are willing to invest what you can afford to lose. Never invest if you cannot afford it if something does go wrong!

My father still thinks Cryptocurrencies will crash because “theres no way to tell its there”. Mind you hes extremely money smart and a great property investor so it goes to show that the older generations are struggling to wrap their heads around cryptos, even if they are good with finances. Just baffles me that someone can use a credit card with USD but cant understand that it could be done the exact same way with a cryptocurrency like Monaco. 
Great to see your father getting involved. I will definitely keep working on mine getting there too. :)
