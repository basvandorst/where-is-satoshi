For real. We JUST started a security focus for CS majors last year. Doubt we'll see anything about cryptocurrency for a few years.

Yeah but when can I transfer to my own wallet
@_date: 2018-08-15 19:54:51
Ok nvm, I'm just a moron who didn't check through all of the settings on squarecash. Profile -&gt; BTC -&gt; enable withdrawals

Yes, a gun is cheaper than silence.

That's what I was trying to get at in a polite manner. You're being a bit of a dick, and to the wrong person.

Dann that blows. I'm sure it was planned that way though. Guns wouldn't have helped. Might've been different for the guy in the post though since they needed him to get the seed or private key.

I think you're overestimating our economy as a whole and how well us millenials are faring. 75% of is have debt with 25 percent carrying more than $30,000 of debt and 11 percent trying to pay back more than $100,000 according to a 2018 study by NBC News

How did that home invasion go?

Sorry, exporting the account as showed gives a root key dissimilar to the HD accounts with no "xpriv" in the front and much shorter.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:03:53
Here is a image from mycelium support showing an example of what I have. There is no xpriv, and using the passphrase in the bip39 tool for the mnemonic throws an invalid error.

Am I going to have to wait for S2X wallets to be built or are they available? I looked at btc gold (had some btc on a paper wallet before that fork) and that looked complicated enough, not sure where to start. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:22:40
Thanks, could you explain further? The tool seems to need a mnemonic. I only have a QR code of the encrypted private key and a pass phrase that I recorded at the time of back up. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:33:41
It's been like a week since I transferred btc from my vault to my wallet. STILL being confirmed. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:00:33
How does selling S2X help? Doesn't that just mean someone is buying it? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:42:51
Thank you for the descriptive reply, definitely learning more about mycelium. I had created this "SA" address before having an HD account. So exporting and accessing the private tab shows a much shorter root key with no "xprv" prepending it. Using the bip39 tool on the HD account created recently bears no addresses resembling my original SA address. :/

Your comment sounds... emotional

Hey it's me, your co-worker who called it sick today

This is the only reliable forecast I can trust

I'd read this!

Can you pm me any resources you utilized integrating a bitcoin payment system to your site? I want to add bitcoin payment options to my online store and am not sure where to start. Thanks
