The market would have crashed and you would have been without a home. The things we ‘say’ we could have done, yet we didn’t. Still, you could borrow $500k and buy BTC, but there is no promise you’ll turn a profit.

I would have $8,100,000 if I had invested $10,000 at the beginning of 2013. Biggest financial regret!
