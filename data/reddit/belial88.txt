Interest. Well what other methods are there? My credit score is around 680 or so, just average, but my wife has a great credit score (near 800 i think?).

I wish people would say why they were downvoting around here.

Care to embellish a little more on the answer? Is prosper better, is btcjam awful? Or are you just a shill?
@_date: 2014-05-02 08:56:04
wow you need to shill out.

But if it's you pay back in USD value, then it would be good?

So why should I use BTCJam instead of using any other method of getting a loan. What other methods of getting a loan are there, really (I know, I know, believe me, I'm trying to research as much as possible, still at an early phase, though business plan is drawn up).

I assumed the loans were tied to USD, so you get a loan for $500 worth of bitcoin, and you repay it in $500 worth of bitcoin. So you could ask for 5 bitcoins, and end up paying back 2 bitcoins, but still the same dollar figure.
Right? Or am I wrong in that assumption?

So is the US dollar and all modern, fiat currencies. But how many stupid people do you think heard that and thought 'Oh my god, what a dangerous and silly thing bitcoin is!'

It's funny that a scammer is asking how people have been scammed. Clearly trying to get how-tos.

I dont understand what happened. Can someone explain in english please, for someone who doesn't quite get all of this? Why would anyone want to take down bitcoin?
I mean, why would anyone want to take down the nyse, right? Not many do, but Im sure some islamic terrorist or mentally unstable person might make a case for it (more to kill people or symbolism than trying to ruin the dollar). It wouldnt make much sense, but it makes even less sense to try to ruin bitcoin.
and what is an asic?
