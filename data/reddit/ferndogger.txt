It’s true that some people at some banks may break the hypothetical law, but do keep in mind that a ban as described would remove a large portion of BTC holders as most are speculating on hopes of higher USD based value.  That loss of demand would plummet the USD value of BTC.
If you’re a true fan of BTC tech, however, you shouldn’t care, because you’d believe that BTC could act as a representation of value without a pair to USD, or any other fiat.

Maybe just have the handle spit out daily stats on performance or something.  Have it imbedded in the protocol somehow.

Well, you could use it, even if it were banned.  You just wouldn’t really be able to exchange it for fiat (legally).  It would have to stand on its own two feet as a currency, not valued by fiat, but in an of itself.

What “they” would ban is the connection between fiat and crypto.
They can stop banks from allowing money transfers to known crypto service companies.  As well, they can ban allowing banking services to crypto companies all together.  If they add a ban on crypto ATMs, then they’ve pretty much cut off any possible way of transferring fiat to an exchange that could convert it to crypto.  Further more, large crypto mining businesses would be banned from banking as well, making it impossible for them to pay for electricity, hardware, etc.
What we’d have left is individuals running smaller nodes, using crypto in an economic system of its own.
Banning the connection to fiat doesn’t kill decentralized crypto, but it sure does change things.

IIRC your fiat on Coinbase is insured, but your crypto isn’t.  That was in the fine print last I checked.

That money is nothing more than a religion.  It’s an inter subjective belief, not an objective truth.  
The more that believe the more real it becomes to the followers.

You’re right that it can’t be stopped, but it’s USD based value would plummet if such a ban were enacted.
This would turn off speculative interests, but shouldn’t effect technological interests.  Might not be a completely bad thing.

So, hypothetically speaking, if a system were to pick the best trade price for you (at that time, and wrt fees), and allow you full control of your keys, would it be a good idea then?

Price represents value.  That’s the job of a price.  Price does not have to be in any dollar value either, it could be anything. 
Edit:  Yes, value is not the same for everyone...but that does not change the function of price to define that value.

Lots of posts arguing about the source of crypto mining electricity.
Instead of arguing, why not find a technological solution to ensure that crypto mining is powered by renewables alone?
Now some smart person go figure out how to do that, and add it to Bitcoin.
Edit: add power source validation to mining protocol.  Something, something power ledger like blockchain incorporation.  Something, something sensors with validation.  Something, something renewable sources energy crypto mining.

Where all y’all propositions at!

Oh yeah, a ridiculous number of steps were skipped.  I’m not the person to solve for this.  Just saying, we can conceptualize an answer.
