Most people lurk. Most people want bitcoin to scale. Not really too much of a surprise if posts about scaling bitcoin are upvoted. Though 300 upvotes in half an hour is unlikely ;)

The stress test cost peanuts as an attack vector which stopped bitcoin functioning as in the above example.
Why is not fixing a temporary vulnerability urgent?
@_date: 2015-08-02 08:27:32
Fair enough, but you do come across as a rude early adopter :)

You couldn't be more wrong. 
1 billion USD in VC funding isn't interested in bitcoin so you can run a node on a shitty laptop through tor.
The market capitalisation of bitcoin is based on speculation over future far greater user base and bitcoin prices.
As soon as it becomes clear that bitcoin is crippled and cannot scale, simply for ideological reasons, then the ecosystem and users will migrate to a new chain - and the exchange value will follow.
That could be a new fork which is just bitcoin without the limitations (XT) and the old chain will no longer be accepted at exchanges or pay processors. As you can imagine it's value would almost instantly become zero.
Or alternatively if the XT fork fails then value will move to a usurping alt blockchain which actually fulfils the potential of bitcoin to be a global secure ideal internet money.
The clowns are those who believe that people are going to maintain the value of the bitcoin blockchain by buying new mining supply, allowing them to remain wealthy in turn for storing value on a  settlement chain which has no actual utility. 
Bitcoin was first and has a huge first mover advantage. But it will be forked into whatever it needs to be for the ecosystem to grow and service the world.

Great. Where can I download and test Lightning?
@_date: 2015-08-12 12:31:40
You keep saying this tripe.
The reality is the vast majority of users and stakeholders in the ecosystem want the blocksize bottleneck lifted.
That includes miners, users and most bitcoin companies who are now going on the record to that effect.
Theymos trying to silence the debate reveals how those opposed really are desperate. Fear mongering and censorship has failed and will not stop bitcoin.
Feel free to play with your Core chain once bitcoin has forked to a scaling solution and taken the market cap with it.
@_date: 2015-08-06 17:50:36
Totally disagree.
@_date: 2015-08-12 12:15:29
As already established your view is confined within an extremely vocal minority.
You are aware that if the network uses the bitcoinXT client that there will be no 'bitcoinXTcoin', just bitcoin. Regular users will find no difference whatsoever.
Those in support of small blocks will be free to keep using the old Core chain, though do not expect it to be accepted by merchants/exchanges or have any residual monetary value.
Ultimately the majority will decide. 
@_date: 2015-08-12 12:23:49
Come on. Blockstream's business model is to profit from off chain solutions. It is in their direct interest to keep the main chain limited and cluttered to offer a product with seeming advantages to transacting on chain. 
That is why they want fees to rise (fee market), and the Max blocksize to remain limited. They also want to phase out 0-conf transactions. Then look at blockstrream's amazing solution: instant, cheap! Just like bitcoin 2009-2015!
@_date: 2015-08-12 12:38:21
So blockstream want to stop bitcoin scaling so they can service banks with confidential sidechain solutions?

And to be fair this is an existential argument about two different directions to push bitcoin in the future.

If the new fork with 60% of users/miners includes merchants then it is bitcoin. 
The reason being the original chain will have 0 economic value. Very soon no miners will mine it, why would they?
Simple. As you well know.
@_date: 2015-07-24 12:52:03
Why will the chain hold any value if individuals arent using it?
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:28:30
Hey great idea. Why don't we get together and employ enough of the core devs to stall bitcoin core development until we can launch our own side chain that outperforms bitcoin because it centralised and requires trust!. Let's call it blockstream. Oh wait..
@_date: 2015-07-15 15:46:09
It's the usual suspects pushing their agenda to get blockstreamcoin used in the future.
As evorhees says shapeshift does thousands of transactions and mitigates risk of double spends to such a degree they have had one double spend. One.
The uncomfortable fact for Peter todd and Luke-jr is that 0-conf has worked for years without issue. Everyone on both sides of the transaction know that a transaction is not secure until it is included in a block, ideally several blocks. But it is good enough if risk is understood.
Perhaps if devs stuck to Satoshi's vision of bitcoin and worked on increasing network throughput, speeded up how quickly transactions go on chain (say by increasing the blocksize) instead of deliberately crippling bitcoin by: 
Fixing blocksize at 1mb (~3 tps written to chain!!) in a world of rapid rises in network and hardware performance.
Introducing a fee structure to ostensibly keep the network functioning with rising traffic and a transaction cap.
Yay for progress!
@_date: 2015-08-10 10:16:33
Yeah I don't think the billionaires who have invested are quite as stupid as you would like to think. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:44:55


Deliberately obstructing bitcoin scaling by refusing to raise the blocksize is better? We live in a world of Moores law and rapidly rising network bandwidth. The blockstream solution - cap transactions written to the blockchain to a cripplingly low level, make users compete for a place on the chain by creating a fee bidding war. Endgame - use blockstreamcoin - a private centralised solution that users have to trust. Core devs profit!
Or removing 0-conf 'instant transactions' when they have functioned in a perfectly acceptable fashion for years is making bitcoin better?
Since Gavin stepped down bitcoin has lost it's way. Satoshi needs to return and remind you lot what bitcoin is all about (not lining your own pockets).

Now this is interesting. 
If users need to be online with a node for payment channels to work then how is that going to work with most people using webwallets or phone wallet apps to transact btc?
I am still not entirely sure I understand how these payment channels work in terms of where the fee will go - since you were (correct me if wrong) a founder of blockstream - could you break down how the fee system will work in practice. Does the large fee go to the miners? Or does the LN/hubs take a slice?

Instead of googling general relativity you might be better served actually doing something useful.
@_date: 2015-07-16 18:38:03
Especially when programmers for bitcoin core are arguing:
*1) to keep the cap fixed at 3 TPS in perpetuity
*2) are implementing a market fee system which in light of 1) will lead to fees rising with transaction volumes
Why hobble bitcoin? Because they are being paid by a company developing a for profit sidechain which can handle much higher TPS with lower fees.
Go team ~~bitcoin~~blockstream!
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:33:37
0-conf has worked fine for years. All parties know that 0-conf does not exclude double spending risk but it is good enough for small transactions.
You thinking you are superior to Satoshi isn't a great way to sell removing existing functionality from bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-24 06:59:28


So, just take the artificial temporary cap off the blocksize in Core and avoid those problems..
@_date: 2015-07-29 06:06:06
It significantly more than doubles the amount of spam transactions/cost required because blocks are not empty at present.
@_date: 2015-07-24 07:09:49
It isn't that binary. And suggesting that raising the blocksize to avoid this silent coup d'etat will lead to instant centralisation is ridiculous. Even a casual observer can see that computing power and network speeds continue to rise and get cheaper year on year.
Bitcoin wasn't created to be a settlement layer for banks and fin tech companies. It was created to become internet cash.
@_date: 2015-07-21 19:50:28
Sadly you are right. 
Considering the market cap of bitcoin right now snd in the future we need companies in the bitcoin space to step up and fund Core or an alternative.
As it stands we have developers chasing $ working to actively cripple bitcoin in favour of a sidechain owned by their employer (blockstream).
These changes go against the wishes of the stakeholders in the bitcoin ecosystem.
Bitcoin should be allowed to scale and kept as cheap as possible for as long as possible.
@_date: 2015-07-16 18:27:59
If they are pro-bank on of course it does..
@_date: 2015-07-25 16:29:36
Well actually it does because it allows cryptographic verification of 'an identity'.
@_date: 2015-07-29 23:58:28


What exactly are you prattling on about?
@_date: 2015-07-26 22:19:36


Yeah right!
@_date: 2015-07-16 10:44:12
Technically possible, sure. Probable? Not even remotely.
The chain that allows users to transact will rule. The other will be worthless. The change will be swift, unanimous and decided by exchanges and merchants in advance.
The exchanges miners and merchants want bitcoin to scale and have said so.
The only people promoting keeping bitcoin fixed at 3 transactions per second ad infinitum have direct pecuniary conflicts of interest. It's all a moot point anyway because as transaction volumes rise to fill blocks the network will choose the solution that scales - damn a small clique who are against it.
@_date: 2015-07-25 17:06:16
OK 'SwagPokerz' :)

This is my concern and one that has been echoed on bitcointalk by various people.

@_date: 2015-07-17 12:58:51

It may be 'easy' but it is massively more expensive to maintain such an attack with the block size at 8mb or greater than 1mb.
@_date: 2015-07-29 21:57:54
What a load of shit. 
The only reason why transactions are backing up during what is a terrifically cheap 'attack' on the system is because the blocksize is so low. A substantially higher blocksize would allow the rate of transactions written to the immutable chain to rise dramatically and also make any spam attack orders of magnitude more expensive.
Talk about getting it arse backwards.
