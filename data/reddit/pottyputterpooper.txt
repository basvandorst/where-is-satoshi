Igornant technical question: how can you tell which entity is behind this? Are these transactions all linked to addresses that are in turn linked to coinbase?

But fiat-BTC pairs totally dominate. If you remove tethers like the yuan was removed, why would you expect a different outcome? Also, tethers are probably acting like a safe haven trade on exchanges without fiat pairs like binance. I bet btc or eth will emerge as the new safe haven trade if tethers disappeared.

It would be far superior, but I wouldn’t hodl your breath. Better education in the states could help. In my experience, even among ‘professionals’, personal conflict of interest, ego, the bias to believe what is convienent and fulfills previous beliefs is just far too strong of an urge. Human nature is hard to resist, but the fight is worth fighting. Too bad people cant upload smart contracts to their brain (whatever that means) to make decisions that are in their, and society’s best interest. 
Where we are as a species was only possible with specialization, and thus specialists. Adding an element of decentralization is probably healthy as long as centralized knowledge or experts aren’t completely dissmissed purely bc they are centralized and offer inconvenient advice.

In the video he clearly talks about the fact we shouldn’t look to authority for ‘truth’. I get that he was getting abstract to make a point about how the public (at least in the states) want to look to a ‘knowledge authority’ of some kind to comfort them and give guidance. I was making the point that this idea seems to resonate with other aspects of society right now. I interpret it as some of the anti-elitism clearly going around. I must have distracted from that by focusing on science. There was a gem of an interview on the bbc with the brexit Nigel guy where the interviewer says something like “but all the experts say that full brexit would be bad for the country” Nigel then dismissed the experts purely bc they have an idea that he doesn’t like, not bc it’s not likely to be true. If you extend the metaphor that there is no objective truth to politics or elsewhere, as happens on Facebook, then that is scary and frustrating. I think this is happening more than it should or people realize. Do you disagree? I also wonder if this is relatively new or just more noticed

Fascinating. However, when this philosophy of anti-authority applies to things like evidence-based fields (science!), things get kind of scary. I'm a scientist and it takes years of specialization and training to 'do science' properly. To disregard this in favor of fear/popularity-driven ideas (anti-vaxers, for example) is terrifying - right back to the middle ages. This sentiment also bears a striking resemblance to the anti-elitism fueling Trump's rise. Apple and oranges with bitcoin vs science/politics, but the similarity is hard to ignore. Very good insight (once again) from Andreas.

here's hoping the exchanges opt into LN...segwit hasn't been much of a success so far. It will be interesting to see if exchanges and businesses choose to either go through the effort to update infrastructure to facilitate bitcoin or simply accept a more convenient coin. It will also be interesting to see how the economics of mining reacts. Someone must have tried modeling this.

Yep. I agree. Biology publishing is trying to shift towards more open access to lower the barriers. I was thinking of public entities, like the CDC and EPA. It’s hard for nonspecialists (and often them too) to critically evaluate all evidence. You do some mix of trusting experts and believing what you want to believe.

How about the Syrian American Medical Society? They provide a wide range of medical care within and around Syria for those affected by the war. The situation has been and still is desperate for countless innocent people in Syria.
I traveled to Syria before the war and couchsurfed with a guy in Aleppo who I still keep in touch with. His family made it safely to Turkey, but his brother is an MD and would travel into Aleppo during heavy fighting to provide medical care. There was a time when the city was surrounded and everyone feared a civilian massacre. Turns out he was actually behind enemy lines and all of us were terrified he would be killed. He somehow made it back to Turkey safely.
This guy was super fortunate to have made it out of Aleppo with his family (I mean what else matters in life?), only to risk his life and the financial stability of his family to selflessly help those in the most dire situation. He was working for SAMS during all of this. I had never donated anything in my life but after learning about all of this, I now give regularly and without hesitation. I met a ton of Syrians as a solo backpacker in their country and EVERY SINGLE PERSON treated me with a level of hospitality that blew me away. I like to think that my modest donations have helped at least one of those people or their loved ones.
I just jointed reddit after lurching this subreddit for a while. Wasn’t sure what my first comment or post would be until I saw this. Thanks for reading.

Maybe what I do is I keep control of the keys, but share the wallet address with her. That way if things got nasty in the future the courts could say “she is entitled to half of your holdings at x address”.

Good reason to be excited: Most of the top trading pairs for BTC are with XRP. I would think this is a better long term situation for BTC than if most pairs were to fiat. BTC could keep going lower as long as XRP keeps up the momentum.

I meant adoption. So I agree, it has not been a success in term of the ecosystem because not enough people are using it
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:48:42
If segwit has taken so long to be adopted, how sure can we be that LN won’t suffer a similar fate.  Everyone says that segwit would alleviate lots of this but alas it’s s fix no one opts into. I’m honestly curious what the incentives will be for exchanges and wallets to adapt.

Very, very valuable. THE preferred store of value, especially if modern monetary theory becomes established and/or there is a world wide sovereign debt crisis. So many intriguing scenarios could play out. What if the next war is primarily economic and countries like Russia, North Korea and Iran go all in with bitcoin? Sanctions? Ha! Worthless! Then imagine China wants in on the action...who really knows. Except of course that bitcoin is fucking awesome and is god awfully undervalued right now.

I’m still blown away by how many smart people out there don’t understand the basic principles for why bitcoin is revolutionary and valuable. Tried to teach some friends over the weekend. Surprisingly frustrating convo. They’re loss for not getting some now! Also, it’s beyond crazy to me why anyone would actually sell their bitcoin anytime before at least 10 years from now (unless of course for a $ emergency). Hodl strong!

Large institutions have strict minimums of cash they must hold each day as a % of their assets. The total amount of cash they need on a given day changes, so they borrow from each other, usually from others who have more than the minimum.  They essentially trade US treasuries for the cash minus interest.
The target interest rate for this overnight borrowing is 2ish %. Here, there was not enough supply of lenders so the interest rate shot up to 9-10%, so the fed had to intervene to keep the money supply (liquidity) high enough so that the interest rate reached their target.
In short, it does not impact us as long as the liquidity doesn’t dry up and this ‘repo’ rate doesn’t skyrocket, or else the banking system is in big trouble.

I of course don’t actually know, but I fear there will be a good amount of selling pressure. On the sell side, I think the miners will take full advantage. In commodity markets it is super useful to have predictable revenue streams if you grow/produce something. Here, it is the miners. On the buy side, who out there ‘consumes’ BTC on a regular basis?
It could also be that there is organic demand for BTC and the miners merely provide liquidity, because whose else in their right mind would be selling?!
There will also be speculators on either side but I can’t think of ‘buy side’ demand for BTC settled futures...thoughts?
