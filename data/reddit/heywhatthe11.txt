Exactly. It takes 3 days to download. It also will not fit on a 32gb usb stick anymore. Add in the fact that the QT does not make it one-click easy to setup full-node mode, and you've killed it by simple project management lazyness...
Easily fixed with these 3 things: Include a optional blockchain bootstrap file with QT, prune the darn blockchain to under 32gb, and add an easy full-node mode checkbox.

That's just great until you get hit in the head with a 2x4, and it changes the way your brain reacts to your password.
Then suddenly you are both dumber and poorer...

Well duh. Good ones (name brand usb 3.0) are still $25-30, and "Just buy a bigger one" does not help the 3 day download problem...

Reduce the size of the blockchain, so a full install can live on a cheap 4-8gb usb stick. (its currently 33GB, so all the 32gb usb bitcoin cards recently became useless) Then use this update to promote it.

This works pretty good if you have amazon prime.
