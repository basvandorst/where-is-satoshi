There’s nothing special about bitcoin. It truly is one of the worse coins when it comes to technology. 
It has changed way too much since the early years. It’s now traceable. It’s regulated in the futures. It’s expensive. Transaction times are slow. No one uses it for a currency. It’s all speculation. I walked out of that door awhile ago.

Bitcoin isn’t going anywhere. Sit down.

The fact that it is trading on speculation only.

That’s a terrible interest rate.

Lololololol. Bitcoin is worthless and will be worth even less as time goes on.

With no rent/mortgage you should be a multimillionaire come 50+ given you are -30.

Because it’s a stupid comment. Also why not pay off debt then buy real estate on debt and use cash flows to pay off mortgage. No difference besides mortgage having a lower interest burden than student loans.

Don’t buy bitcoin at all.

What makes BitCoin a Facebook and not a MySpace this early? Let’s say, cryptos replace the banking system (which you should really say Federal Reserve/Fiat Currency) what stops a better platform shutting down BTC. There are 10s if not 100s of cryptos on the market now. I’m honestly curious.
