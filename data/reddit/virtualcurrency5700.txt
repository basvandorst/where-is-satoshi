What do you normally use this for? The benefits listed talk about using it with other people, is this how most of you are using it? How does it work exactly? Or are you just using it as another wallet currently (I have AirBitz, so I'm just wondering)?

Entirely true. The quotes merely seemed related (to me.) I guess they both drive home the point that those who want to be in power are more likely to be corrupted or misuse the privileges which come with that power. I always thought that anyone in a leadership role (regardless of the importance), should have studied Macbeth for like a solid year before beginning the job. Irrational hopes aside, I appreciate those who don't seem to follow the standard model for any position where others look to them for help. IMHO, SN has done a lot of things right when it comes to breaking the mold, and I think he (she/they) has done a lot to make us all feel empowered.

That. Is. Awesome.

The article does a decent job at presenting both sides of the issue, even if the vast majority of people in the finance world seem more pro-blockchain than bitcoin. It feels a bit like Blockbuster (the banks) vs. Netflix (virtual currency), with the larger conglomerates, trying to make sure they don't somehow miss the boat.  I just hope there's no more major scandals during this critical period.

I've always loved this somewhat similar quote: 
It is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it... anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.
Douglas Adams
It's a tough balance to strike when it comes to leadership, but I think SN had the right idea. I certainly appreciate his/her/their strategy (and modesty.)

It's odd that SN would go so far to hide his identity, and then do an ‘I’m Batman’ kind of reveal. Not to say that he/she/they could never go public, but this would be an out-of-character way to go about it.

Bitcoin will do to banks what Netflix did to Blockbuster.

This is great news! California State Assembly also just voted 64-1 for more regulations on DFS, so it's headed to the Senate. (Which is also great, considering we've managed to fall down on taxing practically every other emerging industry.)

I agree this is a good enough incentive to move people into getting Bitcoin. It will almost definitely be the merchants who dictate virtual currency's demand, and not the other way around. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 20:08:36
What, in your opinion, is the single largest factor for why more merchants have failed to show interest in Bitcoin? (Fear of change, lack of customer demand, too much uncertainty in the technology, not enough positive PR etc)? 
@_date: 2016-01-29 23:59:30
I love this story. The human element (stubbornness, pride and anger) can be deeply hidden by the technical jargon and  theory. But at the heart of it lies a lack of collaboration and ultimately, a loss of SN's original vision.

I was wondering the same thing. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 23:45:50
That's a great question, and one I don't have the answer to. What I did take it upon myself to do was run through some (rough) numbers based on their Twitter feeds. I entirely acknowledge that 1. I did not use the most precise measurement techniques to arrive here and 2. that Twitter feeds are not necessarily indicative of the real numbers at all, but it should give a level of indication as to the enthusiasm. Of the (seemingly lay people, I discounted people in the industry) posts about saving, these were the numbers:
Fold App (since running the promotion)
11 people posted that they directly saved money (vast majority was for Starbucks) on purchases
Several (3-4) people just Tweeted about the promotion in general. 
Purse.io 
11 people posted about saving money at Amazon 
Several people about 3-4 people just posted they saved money or retweeted the promotion. 
I...technically do have a life...but I really did want to know. I'd love to chat more about this with you since I'm interested in bringing Bitcoin to the masses, but I'm guessing you've got a lot on your plate.

Agreed, although I suspect the opposition will still be staunch, regardless of their level of knowledge. All they'll see is how much there is to lose from virtual currency as opposed to how much there is to gain for the people and for this country. All I can hope for is that public opinion will change enough when it comes to banking so that Congress doesn't really have a choice.

What are the main concerns of the merchants that sign up with you? Do you know much about the buyers at all? Are you getting people who aren't as familiar with virtual currency?
@_date: 2016-02-03 17:32:25
I went to the same meetup as you. It was billed as 'Save 20% on Amazon' but no one even mentioned that offer, even though I was there for an hour and a half. Instead, it was just a group of people with no real leader all talking about Bitcoin. It was a little odd. I only knew about BitClub because a man I was speaking to kept throwing it into the conversation as if I knew the story behind it. All I really understood about it was that he thought it might have been a scam. At the end, there was someone on Skype trying to explain BitClub to me, but the place was packed so it was extremely difficult to hear. Later I looked it up like you and saw all the MLM references. I will say that some of the people there did seem to be people who genuinely did seem interested and wanted to learn how they could use Bitcoin even if this was not a good place to do so.

Honestly, I'm not commenting about either side per se. But even if that were the case, what's stopping Team Water from showing that willingness? I have faith in the community still, I  just like the analogy pointing out some of the fundamental problems that lie at the heart of the discussions (arguments.) 
@_date: 2016-02-04 16:07:54
Sorry, sign up was the wrong term then...what would be the main reason that you wouldn't run the openbazaar node then? (lack of technical knowledge, lack of faith in the system, lack of buyers, etc.)
