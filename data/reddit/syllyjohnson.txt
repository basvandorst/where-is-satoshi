It seems kind of cool to me, but I wouldn't pay much of anything, and probably only be interested in like one block if I even wanted to bother.

Legal profit - what is important for me. And it will be better if nobody knows about my level of income.

Glad to see Olivier came through with his offer. Bye bye Bitcoin Foundation.

It'll be interesting to see what Apple does when the first wallet app gets sent to Apple again for approval. I wonder what made them decide to change their mind...

It works if you're willing to put in the research and learn the indicators which reveal likely scams. You don't need to invest in many projects to get a large return. Just be patient, learn the technology, understand the market, and make sure you understand the supply/emission schedule. 
There are quite a few people making a living trading alts. There are also people who use it as a sort of casino. But it's certainly not impossible to make a profit.

It is very telling when a nation bans Bitcoin.  It's one thing to warn people about it using at their own discretion but when you ban Bitcoin it makes me wonder what the real reasoning behind that decision is.  It's also telling that corruption is so high in Bangladesh and I can imagine a small amount of people would be threatened by the lack of financial control Bitcoin would bring if the people of Bangladesh decided to adopt Bitcoin.

okay, i'm pretty sure glenn beck has some bitcoins as well as some of his friends. he's the kind of guy to pump it if he has something to gain from it; he is just political theater. i hope bitcoiners don't fall in love with him just because he's pushing bitcoins.

I think people believe this because they believe it will get us out of the mess our Country is in regarding the recession and problems with debt we have. It will be a long time and it may never happen that bitcoin will replace fiat and even if it did what is to say it definitely would get us out of our problems? It may help but to completely eliminate problems is something I can not see happening, at least not yet.
@_date: 2014-09-05 11:52:48
His friend because he is tech savvy will probably appreciate the Bitcoin more than anything else its a lot of money to give to a friend.

I would imagine that the insurance only covers their losses, not the losses of their customers. The insurance would likely only payout if they followed verifiable security policies that would prevent the vast majorities of possible thefts. 
Any insurance company that would payout any kind of insurance claim solely because the insured claims to be a victim would be horrible at managing risk.

I'm pretty sure right now that Bitcoin will be the next world reserve currency.
I believe in 95% of daily news is conspiracy, and this fits my confirmation biased world view.
When CNN starts to mention it you know it's part of a conspiracy, at least that's what I believe.
I'm a little bit puzzeled if I should continue with bitcoin or choose another coin to invest/convert in.
Maybe I should start my own coin just to be sure...

Slightly confused about all this. I thought that already there were two Bitcoin ATMs operating in Vancouver. The first one, located at the Waves Coffee Shop (Robocoin), and the other one located at the 332 Water Street (Lamassu ATM, Quadriga CX, near the harbor).

Ebay will never allow you to take bitcoin directly. Even if ebay didn't own paypal, they'd be stupid to promote the use of bitcoin directly. Ignorant customers would be getting regularly scammed, and sellers could disappear and not pay seller fees. They'd have to recommend a trusted escrow, or even force the use of an escrow service. They basically have that escrow in paypal already. Paypal must see increased profits, or a reduction in lost profits, before they will implement bitcoin. The best thing any of us can do to promote bitcoin to paypal, is to promote bitcoin to ebay users via auctions entirely unrelated to bitcoin. Start adding something about bitcoin to the description of any item you list on ebay. "Don't like paypal? I accept cash or bitcoins in person."

Since companies (like Coinbase) are giving college students bitcoins, should universities start incorporating virtual currencies like bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, etc. into their curriculums? What do you think? 
@_date: 2014-09-28 15:28:02
Add them to the "Fools" bucket. 
Some governments try anything, even fear, to get what they want. In this case, their economy is failing and they trying to protect the corrupt fiat currency, with bad laws. 
I feel sorry for the poor people of that country, who has to suffer for the bad decisions made by their governments.

Much Wow hmm did you have a source for that 
But if I had to guess a reason its called the Winklevoss Twins 
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:02:04
Well it certainly looks as though its been aimed at Bitcoin - what other virtual currency is big enough to qualify that developers would bother with a phone wallet? 
@_date: 2014-08-23 14:25:36
Change History with your BTC wallet!
@_date: 2014-09-05 11:59:38
If you're using it for cold storage just make sure to create the wallet on a live-cd or permanently offline PC. Also keep the the papers safe from other people viewing them. Otherwise that sounds fine.
@_date: 2014-09-05 11:58:05
they show incredible interest in bitcoin
they know they have found a big thing

How is this less complicated than the current system where the jury just votes?
@_date: 2014-09-05 11:55:50
I wouldn't be so sure about that.  Paper money is really very primitive and requires a *lot* of resources to create and manage.  Why do you think that BTC being "online" means that paper money will never disappear?  Is it because you think that something could threaten the existence of the Internet and so it would be unsafe to rely solely upon money transacted online?

What a huge post from Coindesk with a small and meaningless sense. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 15:27:02
I could see the tiny fraction of people caring become a lot more people than there are fresh blocks eventually so the premium could go up, so there is some speculative value. However, while you can buy a virgin block you can't safely sell it once you buy it. You pay people to mine to your key, but then once you've got it if you give the key to someone they have to trust you forever or else move it and destroy it's virginity. So... I'm thinking overall it's mostly a no go.

It is funny and real. Bitcoin needs a solution to make its transactions faster

Thats not bitcoin then, how would one redeem their coins from the note other than physically taking it to this bank (would need locations everywhere )?
@_date: 2014-06-21 19:18:41
The intervals are too large. There's a big difference in owning lets say 101 or 900 bitcoins.

If nothing else, the fact that Bitcoin is scheduled for a maximum of 21 million bitcoins, makes it not a Ponzi. It might be something similar, but it is definitely not a Ponzi.
@_date: 2014-06-08 06:32:20
Is that so that you can recreate the wallet if you lose or break it?

Less than 0.1% of the world population own bitcoin, clearly lots of room for adoption to grow
Hopefully the plethora of apps under development presenty will ease adoption even further
