Yeah, for now... until you get paid in a cryptocurrency. Obviously not right now, but it is short term thinking saying that you will always be tied to fiat.

But what if it goes backwards...

Dude you are the one spreading FUD here

Clarify please? If the difficulty goes up the next day, then it is less profitable even if it’s the the same price point, but I could have a fundamental misunderstanding.

It's irrelevant to the point he's making, but the bigger point is that you attacked his character and in turn made yourself look like the villain.

Literally NO ONE would care about this if Ver wasn’t trying to piggyback off BTC’s name.

They didn’t say they were homeless, just no house, so probably renting.

Silver and Gold is used extensively in the brass musical instrument industry and there is no substitution for those acoustic properties for another metal, but I'm only mentioning it because you said you haven't heard of any.
As far as store of value I mostly agree with you, Diamonds, Silver and Gold have a vastly inflated value compared to their industrial uses, but humans are a stubborn bunch and dammit what is traditional is gonna be familiar any way you look at it.

You could easily have a query after the call, “Was this a dropped call?” to return the funds

You would be stealing from people you know... I mean sure you can be petty for a bit but people are just gonna stop calling you all-together.

Taking your American viewpoint, wouldn’t letting the market decide be a more capitalist approach? It’s a clear answer, BCH is not Bitcoin.

When it TRULY comes time to sell your crypto, you won't have to.

He said to cut the taxes 100%, which would be 0% taxation, but honestly 15-19% capital gains tax sounds just right to me. Governments use taxes for subsidies (among many other things) which in turn create new businesses/jobs, so it's also necessary to have taxes.

Racist remarks aren’t needed to make a point and often times degrade your message
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:30:59
That is an interesting point! Thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:54:19
Despite views on HOW they’re used, taxes are ultimately necessary to run a government.

Sounds like something you should talk to a lawyer about.
