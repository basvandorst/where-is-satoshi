Hi! I used to get paid in Bitcoin for my last job too.
  
There's good and bad in this.
  
 * You get Bitcoin. Yay  
 * Potential gains by just not cashing it out.  
  
**Bad**  
 * You will never want to sell it.  
 * You have to sell it to stay financially afloat  
 * Taxes get weird. I had to get an attorney to figure it out.   
 * Your money can dip easily. Btc peaked today? You lose money waiting for transaction confirmation before you can really sell the stuff.  
  
I thought it was cool in the beginning too, but the reality is that the rest of the world isn't ready to switch over to BTC yet.  
  
If you need to sell most of the btc every payday, and keep what btc you want as your savings account, then what's the difference between that, and buying btc with fiat currency on payday?  
  
Take it from someone who got paid in BTC for a few months this year (I got reamed on r/personalfinance). It's not worth it.

I got my first paycheck right when BTC peaked at $5k and it started tumbling downward. I couldn't sell right away because you can't sell BTC that's pending the 6 confirmations. The network was busy that day, so my confirmations didn't come until a couple hours later, when BTC had already sunk to the mid 4k's. In a few hours, I lost over 10% of my paycheck to BTC volatility, and there wasn't anything I could do about it, but I still had to sell because I needed to eat.
