I might not be a question of _need_, but rather _want_?

Isn't that what they always say? Your funds are safe. Nothing to see here. We are working on it. How has that usually worked out? Did everyone at Mt. Gox already get their money back?
Also, you are not at all worried that they seem unable to roll back the update using backups and the roll back plan that they surely had made before doing such an extensive update? _Especially_ since they already aborted the update once, due to unforseen problems.

slush0 did not address e.g. using a flexible connector, did they? Also what does "did not work as expected"? What did they expect? And again, I don't hold the Trezor devs as some sort of HW gods who can't be wrong. Again, I simply pointed out that other devices managed this feat. edit: Basically, just because Trezor says "We couldn't figure out a solution", does not mean that there is no solution. It just means that they couldn't figure one out.


Except that I _did_ think about that, so there is no reason for me to say that. Maybe _you_ didn't think about that, which is fine.

I'm not sure what _you_ are imagining, but devices that do exactly this already exist. In fact pretty much every U2F token works like that (Nitrokey, Yubikey, ...)


Are you imagining that the USB police will come knocking on your door if you use an extension cable? That's not what I'm suggesting. I'm saying it would be useful to be able to use the device without an extra cable. Do you need a cable? Great. Use one. Don't need a cable? Great. Don't use one.


That's simply isn't true though, as proven by other types of USB devices that plug directly in, without damaging your computer.
Heck, go ahead and include a USB cable in the packaging, and include a note that you **strongly** recommend using it. All I'm saying is that it's kind of embarrassing to risk not being able to access your funds just because you're not carrying an additional USB cable with you at all times.
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:48:35
Why is there not a single HW wallet that plugs directly into a device, rather than requiring carrying a bulky cable with you?
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:47:21


Right. And I said that if others are able to do it, then clearly it's possible. What if they concluded that it's possible, given enough effort, but the demand just isn't there to spend the time to get it right? Wouldn't my feedback in that case be a valuable datapoint that there _is_ demand?


I don't think the Trezor HW engineers are some infallible geniuses like you seem to think. I just said that devices that do the "impossible" exist, so clearly it is possible. Again, maybe it is not worth the hassle. Maybe the device would become too large. Maybe it would become too expensive. But it _is_ possible.


Oh please, stop with the condescending attitude. It's not productive. The _practical_ reality is that it is possible to create a device that you can plug into a computer directly. This is proven by the fact that these devices exist. Just going "Nope, can't be done!" is not a good reply in that case.
Trezor has full right to say that they don't want to implement it. If they say that they did not find it practical, that is their prerogative. They handled this perfectly well and did not go down a route telling me how I am wrong, and that I don't understand the issues. At the same time, I'm fully justified in saying that it is possible.
We have conflicting views on the practicalities. That's OK. I'm just pointing out _facts_, but apparently getting shit for that.
I'd also like to point out that obviously a rigid connector is also not the only way to implement no-separate-cable-required.
@_date: 2018-05-29 13:51:20
Isn't that how every USB memory stick works though? And many U2F tokens as well (meaning you can even add physical buttons without breaking them).
I'd love to be able to e.g. carry a trezor with me on a keychain, but also having to carry a USB cable in my pocket is a bit much.

Hindsight is 20/20. It seems the argument is often: "They laughed at Amazon.com, and now look!". Well, a lot of people also laughed at pets.com, and they were fully right.
It's similar to "They also laughed at Einstein first!". Well, "they" also laughed at many others who were wrong. The fact that someone or something is dismissed says nothing about something completely different. The fact that Amazon was dismissed, but turned out successful, does not mean that the same will happen to Bitcoin, just because it also has been dismissed.
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:25:51


Does Trezor require 100+ button presses to confirm a single transaction? If so, there is a lot to improve in the UI. Seems to me it is actually a lot closer to maybe 10 presses to unlock the device, and then one or two to confirm a transaction. And you might do this once per week, compared with e.g. U2F devices that you might press multiple times per day.


I have literally zero interest in this, and it's an extremely silly proposition. I gave _constructive_ feedback in order to improve something, and gave examples of other devices proving that it works. Clearly, I should never do that again. Silly me. The world is perfect as it is. Carry on.

That's pretty much what the investors in pets.com said. Maybe you are right. Maybe you are wrong. That's the point. I don't know. You don't know. And in any case, the point is that the ridicule itself has nothing to do with whether Bitcoin is successful or not. Plenty of successful things have been ridiculed. Plenty of unsuccessful things have been ridicules. Plenty of successful things have not been ridiculed. Plenty of unsuccessful things have not been ridiculed. There really is very little correlation between success and whether or not something is dismissed.

Sure, if you use the device constantly.

Has this been an actual concern? I mean, it's not terribly difficult to open a small account in a well-established bank. It's having 2 billion USD with them that is the tricky part. This sounds like a strawman.


Surely it makes sense to get the price down to the "correct price" (assuming it's being artificially inflated), rather than just waiting. Your suggestion does not really make sense. Uncertainty limits the usability of BTC.


Well, yeah, throwing around retarded claims is obviously retarded. But the very basis of Tether is regular audits. It's even something that Tether themselves say is needed. So asking for such a basic, funamental, check is not really "retarded" IMHO. You wouldn't want to build your house on a foundation that the constructor refuses to let anyone inspect, would you? Especially if the constructor advertises as one of their main selling points that they will provide comprehensive analysis of the quality.


That's awfully convenient for some people. Also, no one is asking for complete transparency. People are asking, for something very basic. Something that even Tether themselves acknowledge as necessary (as per their whitepaper).

Again, what does that  have to do with anything? Traveling Salesman is not even NP (it's NP-hard), so I'm not sure what you are referring to unless you mean the decision version of the problem. But even then, what does it matter that a specific problem can not be checked efficiently? There are many, many, others that can.


Right. That's NP.


The question is not if it is possible. The question is _if it is more cost effective_. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 11:31:28


That's such a silly thing to say. There are _tons_ of coins being "built" every day, and people _don't_ come to them. They die. It's not enough that something exists. It also has to be _better_ than the alternative. People won't use ASICs just because they exist. They use ASICs if and only if they are better than the alternatives.


So now you agree that there are coins that are ASIC resistant? Do you no longer agree with your earlier statement


Because now you are saying that there is already Monero, for which there are not ASICs produced, because it would not be cost-effective?
@_date: 2018-07-08 07:00:18
Not  necessarily. Make the algorithm complicated enough, and you'd essentially need a proper CPU anyway, except CPUs would be way cheaper due to being produced in massive quantities.
@_date: 2018-07-09 14:01:35
That was an arbitrary number. Make it 64GB if you want (which would set you back &lt;1000€). It's expensive enough that botnets won't have access to it, and cheap and available enough that anyone can go into a store and buy it.
@_date: 2018-07-08 19:01:06
That still does not answer the question. Why is ASIC _necessarily_ more cost effective than using a general purpose CPU? You seem to have answered a completely different question, if Bitcoin itself is cost effective. That is not what I asked, nor is it what you originally claimed.


You have no idea, yet you are comfortable saying that if you can't do it fast then there is no consensus.
@_date: 2018-07-08 15:08:45
Well obviously. But what does that have to do with this?
Basically you seem to imply that ASICs are more cost efficient for every problem in NP.  This is obviously not true, since ASIC cost and performance scales with problem complexity, while a the cost and performance of a general purpose CPU does not. It is perfectly possible to construct a problem in NP which is sufficiently complex to reduce the efficiency/watt advantage of an ASIC so that it no longer outweighs the larger costs associated with designing, producing, and operating the ASICs. Furthermore, it is certainly possible to create these problems so that the computational speed is not even the bottleneck, which means that the advantage of using an ASIC becomes relatively small, while the cost still remains high.
@_date: 2018-07-08 19:26:23


Yes. That's _power_ efficiency. I'm talking about _cost_ efficiency.
If an ASIC is 10 more power efficient than a CPU, but 1000 times more expensive, it might not be cost effective, even though it is power efficient.
@_date: 2018-07-01 20:01:44

To the people buying them. If you earn less buying an ASIC than buying a CPU, then why would you buy an ASIC?
@_date: 2018-07-09 15:57:08


There are several algorithms with tunable CPU and memory costs. You simply adjust a parameter, which tells you how much memory is required to solve the problem. This is similar to the computational cost of the current PoW can be adjusted.
What you want is to use a parameter that is large enough so that you need a dedicated computer for it (i.e. no hacked cheap VPS' or grandma's desktop who won't notice they've been hacked), but not so large that it is difficult for an interested user to run it. I'd guess something in the 32-128GB range would be good right now, and it could be increased in the future.
One example of such an algorithm is [Lyra](
@_date: 2018-07-07 09:12:46

@_date: 2018-07-07 07:24:24
But that's by design. You make it sound like it happend despite something.
@_date: 2018-07-08 19:58:46
Take a look at the Wikipedia list of NP problems. Construct a problem that chains all of them together. You now have a problem that requires an extremely complicated ASIC (meaning expensive to design and manufacture), or a whole bunch of separate ASICs (meaning expensive to construct and buy).
That's the trivial solution. Obviously you can mix it up by including variations on the problems, or even mixing problems together so that they need to be solved in parallel, rather than series.
As you add new problems the cost for ASICs go up, while CPU stays the same. Add sufficiently many, and CPUs will be more cost-effective, no matter how much faster an individual ASIC is compared to a CPU.
@_date: 2018-07-08 20:27:59


Again, no one is saying it can't be done. I'm saying it's not necessarily more _cost efficient_.


Did you give up on ASICs already? I'd prefer to take care of one topic at a time.
@_date: 2018-07-09 12:05:35


Sure. As I have said many, many, many, times: No one is saying that making ASICs is not possible. But would it be _cost-effective_? You'd need a large team to be able to custom-design new ASICs fast enough. And that adds to the cost significantly.


Now we are moving on to a completely different question. What makes you think that a group of Black Hats could own the network?
@_date: 2018-07-09 08:27:16


Yes. Again, you seem to be missing the point. The point is _not_ that you can't make ASICs. The point is that you can make them so expensive that it is no longer _cost effective_.
Even if it is possible to build ASICs, why would you do that, when CPUs would be cheaper and earn you more money? Why would you want to lose money and time just so you can use custom-designed ASICs rather than buy off-the-shelf parts? I mean, if you _want_ to lose money, go ahead. But to expect _most_ people to want to lose money is absurd.
