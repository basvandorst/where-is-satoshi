they are responsible for a few things. I'd say a balanced policy regarding their fee to coin-age transactions to mine is healthy for the network and a healthy network is in their interest. If they, say, only mine trans &gt;10$ fee the network as a whole would suffer and therefore their income too.

Bitcoin isn't undestroyable, there could be inflation bugs (ok arguably fixable), BGP routing attacks (routing mining, censoring TXs,..), 0-days, theoretically GC priv key attacks,... I'd argue Bitcoin would have a very hard time if a huge government would attack it. A big part of the developers try to make it more resilient and the improvements are huge but to call bitcoin undestroyable is at best far fetched. long reality, short illusions ;-p
@_date: 2019-07-25 08:19:27
Even IF you are ok with (minimal) inflation forever, it's the fact that a normal person can't run a full eth node without spending thousands of $. &gt;2TB SSD and growing fast, that's just nonsense but they won't stop their scam and launch a 2.0 .. oh my ..

@_date: 2019-07-28 07:04:05
HDD or SSD isn't the bottleneck here. It's the CPU/RAM(cache) what limits the verifying process on a RPI. An old HDD really does the job. No need to buy an expensive &gt;250GB SSD for a Bitcoin full node.
@_date: 2019-07-05 04:18:39
You can, and for the lightning node you need a bitcoin node.
@_date: 2019-07-15 07:22:26
just be aware that every payment under the dust limit is not trustless. If your counterparty wants to annoy you he could just gift this payment to a miner.
@_date: 2019-07-02 10:48:20
nope, doesn't work that way, a pruned node still downloads the whole blockchain. It just throws away a certain amount of data after verifying the integrity
@_date: 2019-07-05 11:57:02
it's a opt-in feature, not even remotely a problem ò.Ó 
if you construct a TX you can make it so that you can later bump the fee, the receipt can see that this TX has this option. The TX is slightly larger but if you are a 1s/vb guy and can wait a few hrs or days it's pretty neat (last weeks were no problem to get essentially free)

nontheless, coinjoins are epic. try [ or [ 
with joinmarket you could potentially also earn \~1% annualized with relative low risk if you have a always on node anyway (maybe you run a lightning node/electrum server/... anyways).

Running a Bitcoin full node is very easy, costs next to nothing if you have a HDD &gt;= 250GB and no limit on your data from your ISP.
It also empowers you to run a lightning node, coinjoin software, your own electrum server, btcpay server,...  you gain privacy and verify the integrity of the data you are interested in.
If you run a lightning node you may want to attach a 2nd HDD and make a software raid, which again is very cheap and easy to do. There are tons of good "how-to" articles for all the software mentioned. Combined with joinmarket (coinjoin software) and lightning you can earn up to a few hundreds/thousands satoshi a day with very little risk (you have to be online all the time and unlock your wallet if encrypted).
Have fun! :)
A little outdated version but good compilation to start your journey might be:
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:59:22
you should have an interest in running a full node if you have bc or a related service depending on core, not for the network but to verify the integrity of the data you are working with.
@_date: 2019-07-05 05:22:57
thank you so much, that makes a lot of sense :)
@_date: 2019-07-07 14:17:47
nobody expects anything from you, a lot of people value bitcoin for what it is and to verify the integrity of the data you are interested in you might want to run a node, also for privacy reasons, to be able to run a lightning node, to be able to run joinmarket (coinjoin software),.. there are lots of reasons to run a full node. If you don't want to that's fine, bitcoin doesn't care.
@_date: 2019-07-02 16:44:43
Bitpay sucks, avoid it if possible. /Me personally i spend almost everyday some bits here and there with lightning, which is not only amazingly fast (practically instant) but also very cheap (sub-cent fees). I only have three channels and never had a failed routing. Privacy is better that an on-chain payment too. yay!
@_date: 2019-07-06 09:44:53
not to forget lightning L-BTC and if i got it right one can make a LN payment between those networks, which is just epic imo.
@_date: 2019-07-24 06:29:33
Think of the development of bitcoin as the development of the linux kernel. There are a few known respected experts who can merge patches into the Bitcoin core software (most popular bitcoin software). Everybody can contribute to the software and at the end of the day no one can say what direction it ultimately goes but it follows a few philosophies (e.g. backwards compatibility). To have a "roadmap" for bitcoin you'd need a central authority (which bitcoin is lacking of) and therefore you'd need to know everyone who is working on bitcoin (core) and it's branches to know what goes into it and what is being worked on. As with the linux kernel there are some more urgent things and maintainers (of subsystems) try to motivate participants to work on that to keep the software more resilient or create new features but ultimately it's only what people contribute to it and no one can force someone to create anything. 
Thankfully bitcoin (core) has a few very bright minds and a good ethos around. It unfortunately also attracts a lot of scammers who disturb the signal:noise ratio to trick people into their schemes for profit.

Even BTC is still in an experimental phase, for good reasons. No need to rush things.


you can't, BTC and LN are protocols, if you have the desire to solve a problem with this tech and want it to be in a certain way you can build or contribute to projects. The "fork crowd" demands stuff while being rude AF as if they bought a product and want the protocol to adjust to their needs. That's not how it's working.

i too think bitcoin is aside from the technical breakthroughs a belief system, my stance is to DCA into freedom, i can be my own bank, need no permission from anyone to do whatever i want (granted, legal things, as i too belief the legal framework serves us well as a society) and as long as the system works i'll be fine. Afaik it's the only kind of money that can't be counterfeit, seized or inflated as easily as previous forms of money.
For me it's worth the risks, i enjoy nonetheless :)

certain cards don't work like advertised (e.g. google play store didn't like your code)


At payment, yes. before you pay bitrefill says it's a "25$ card" or whatever value and you receive a discount for lightning payments. As soon as checkout the customer may or may not realize that different cards have different prices
edit: what i'm trying to say is: be transparent about the price in fiat terms, when it's a 25$ card, tell the customer clearly that he is going to pay 30$ and not 25$ and a random btc value i have to check how much it really costs (i'm happy to pay for the service OBV but the UX sucks if, just state that according to bitstamp/kraken/.. it's 30$ for the 25$ card)

nice reply in case anyone wants to see some buzzwords together with how a brainwashed human looks like.
just run a full archive eth node,.. eth sells the borderless, censorship resistance, resilience &amp; decentralized aspects of bitcoin for marketing reasons but under the hood it doesn't work out,..
which would be fine but vitalik et. al. are acting as if eth has all those attributes bitcoin has (and much more, e.g. some of your buzzwords + turing completeness (lol)),+..., which it clearly does not. It's like a rough version of libra, crafted and put on the web but eventually there will be no full verifying nodes or only controlled by people with massive resources (which can be governed), but you do you and build a gamble app with oracles and shit
(actually i'm sorry for the ad hominem in there but i'm tired of all the eth people and their lies , obv a "smart contract dev" who has no idea about the underlying protocol is more a victim of the eth foundation, vitalik,... than a villain but clearly there is central planning going on and bail outs and shit that has nothing to do with the ethos/aspects of bitcoin, which again would be fine if not sold as it would have those aspects,...)

a good portion of their devs regularly shit on the good work done by bitcoin core devs aside from taking money from a company like bitmain ...
their app [ is also clearly bCash branded...
[is their lead backend dev btw...
*"BTW, we all knew this is direction Core was taking Bitcoin even before the scaling debate broke out in full force. Long before the lightning network was a thing people were asked how is Bitcoin supposed to scale if the blocks remain at 1MB and they all pointed to Hal Finney's comment about Bitcoin only being used as a settlement system for banks with everyone just using custodial wallets.*
*Lighting bailed them out in a sense in that they could (disingenuously) say "Oh no we aren't pushing a custodial system. The lightning network is how we're going to scale while remaining non-custodial".*
*But there were plenty of us who knew LN wouldn't work well, if at all. And the last few years and tiny to non-existent amount of LN usage vindicates that view.*
*So now it's back to custodial wallets and banks."*
i like tho, more level-headed...

tried hard to love them, didn't work out. Their fee model is not transparent at all. payed a whopping 20% (instead of 20$, 24$) fee on a card while another one was much cheaper (and both were promoted at discount bc payment happened over lightning), as end-user you won't see exactly why and how much until it comes to the payment. Some cards also don't work instantly and the end-user has to struggle with the problem (contact the company you bought the card for, bitrefill is of no help there) 
Also offered them to make good on their miserable service and repay me my \~5 bucks (lightning) + i'll forgive and forget that a card didn't even work until the company i bought it for credited after weeks(!!). OBV they refused to do so.
@_date: 2019-11-22 09:53:13
The idea of payment channels is as old as bitcoin (well almost, 2010/11 afaik), so you could have gone another route instead of adopting shitcoins, which have inherently the same problem and in the case of BCH is straight unethically to say the least, so there were other options, the easiest one if one assumes your arguments are valid would be to just add LTC (or other shitcoins which don't aggressively attack the bitcoin ecosystem).
also .. the lightning paper is afaik from 2016 so fwiw you could have also worked with them instead of against them, which i imagine is pretty hard since says he knew it couldn't work (well).. suprise, it does.
[ is also clearly branded the same way bcash is ... i guess as part of the deal with bitmain you hold a bag of BCH now, or whatever the motives are, it doesn't feel like you (OB1) are neutral.

e.g. you are in 2001 in germany, you buy a share of company XY for 10€, 10 days later you sold for 20€, you'd get taxed on the basis of the profit (10€) with a certain percentage (e.g. 25%), so you are left with 17.5€ and you payed your taxes, all fine.
If you didn't sell a share of company XY and waited for one year and sold at 20€ the profit (10€) would have been tax free. So you would be left with 20€. 
This was designed as incentive to curb speculation..

Those are some extremist views here, i'd like to add another POV
1. 0.13494528 BTC were found by bruteforcing ([ a keypair can also be made in a bad way and easy to find ([blockchain.info]( lost a ton of BTC to "a white hat hacker" afaik it was ) and in a "better/good" way. Some easy to read/understand info: [
2. Probably some sort of what you believe, there are all sorts of economic models which say/suggest/predict vastly different things. Among Bitcoiners the "Austrian Economics" are popular but there are other popular ones (e.g. keynesian economics)
3. Common sense tells me if the price decreases too rapidly too much the chance of a 51% attack increases but what do i know...
4. Bitcoins are NOT infinitely divisible, a satoshi is the smallest unit (per consensus, it's a signed 64bit int, we could **hardfork** to a unsigned 64bit int and divide a bitcoin into 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 units tho or 128bit or whatever...) edit: [ so if i understand this correctly (probably not), we have a signed int64 which would be enough to add more digits but the line `static const CAmount COIN = 100000000;` prevents this. So we have a number like abc21000000.00000000 instead of a (maybe more usefull) 21000000.00000000abc (where abc are additional digits)
5. People and their moniez :) bias and stuff .. idk
6. nah - do it :)

Just a personal opinion, one can also obtain some sats from friends/meetups and co. without the invasive KYC/AML policies. It's not even the policy itself that bothers me so much but it's only a matter of time till these huge DBs with really sensible data falls into the false hands (hacks, unresponsible handling,..).
Regarding fungibility, yes, i agree, coinjoins/CT/taproot/.. should be the norm. At the moment one has to opt-in via coinjoins and a lot of technical overhead but bitcoin is imo still not ready for the masses. Its just too easy for a normal person that something goes wrong. It has to be easier and private/funbigle by default :)

For two decades as the chief executive of the online retailer Overstock.com, Patrick Byrne has never been far from controversy.
He  posted elaborate theories on his personal website, railed against an  unnamed Wall Street figure he named the Sith Lord and then, last week,  delivered the most eyebrow-lifting tale of all. Mr. Byrne — operating on  the advice, he said, of the Berkshire Hathaway chief executive Warren  Buffett — disclosed that he had been in a romantic relationship with  Maria Butina, a woman accused of being a Russian spy who tried to  infiltrate circles of political power before the 2016 presidential  election.
His statement, with its  references to the “Deep State,” “Men in Black” and “political  espionage,” sent his company’s shares sharply down and baffled  investors. On Thursday, he resigned as Overstock’s chief executive and  chairman, saying his continued presence was complicating the company’s  business relationships.
Those relationships, he said in an interview, included the kind necessary to fulfill his plan to sell the online retailer.
“My presence  could — and likely would — be disruptive to strategic conversations that  are occurring, one of which is with my most preferred suitor in the  entire industry,” he told The New York Times. He declined to name that  potential buyer.
He also said his  presence could lead to problems for the company as it tried to renew  indemnification insurance for its directors and officers. “The fact that  I am so controversial has never been appealing to them, but I know it  is salt in the wound now,” he said.
At  the start of his Overstock days, Mr. Byrne cast an aura as a model  dot-com entrepreneur. In the early 2000s, he was at the head of the wave  of retailers selling rugs, chairs and furniture online. More recently,  he shifted again, to become a significant investor in companies working  on blockchain technology, the concept that underpins cryptocurrencies  like Bitcoin.
But those maneuvers were  overshadowed by the theories he promoted on his personal website,  DeepCapture.com, and the highly combative approach he took against his  critics.
In the 2000s, he railed  against a person he called the Sith Lord, an unnamed Wall Street  mastermind he believed was orchestrating a plot to take down the stock  of his company. Then, last week put out his statement: “Overstock.com  C.E.O. Comments on Deep State, Withholds Further Comment.”
In  it, Mr. Byrne said he had helped the F.B.I. with the “Clinton  Investigation” and “Russia Investigation.” Those, he said, “turned out  to be less about law enforcement and more about political espionage  conducted against Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.”
Although  the statement did not mention her directly, it referred to what he  described as a romantic relationship with Ms. Butina, who is serving an  18-month prison term after being accused by federal prosecutors of  trying to infiltrate powerful political circles at the direction of the  Russian government. She ultimately pleaded guilty to a lesser charge.
Mr.  Byrne said he met Ms. Butina at a libertarian convention in Las Vegas  in 2015. Over the course of their relationship, he said, she spoke  increasingly about meeting or seeking to meet people involved in the  presidential campaigns of Ms. Clinton, Mr. Trump and others. That, he  said, had made him wary. He eventually began communicating with the  F.B.I. about his interactions with her.
Mr.  Byrne said he had released the statement because he realized that  someone would uncover his involvement in the federal investigation if he  did not reveal it himself. He decided to come forward after a  conversation with his “Omaha rabbi” — a reference, he said, to Mr.  Buffett.
Mr. Byrne grew close to Mr.  Buffett through his father, John Byrne, who led GEICO’s financial  turnaround in the late 1970s. Berkshire Hathaway invested in and later  acquired the insurer. Mr. Buffett later tapped the younger Mr. Byrne to  run another Berkshire Hathaway company that made uniforms for  firefighters, police officers, nurses and others. 
Mr.  Byrne bought a little-known retailer in 1999 and transformed it into  Overstock.com, buying up inventory from the many start-ups that went  bankrupt in the dot-com bust. But shortly after the company went public  in 2002, its stock plunged.
Mr. Byrne  blamed a vast network of short sellers, which caused a family rift: His  father eventually left the board, saying he could not support his son’s  crusade against Wall Street.
In  an infamous call with investors and journalists in 2005, the younger  Mr. Byrne accused a “Miscreants Ball” of unscrupulous hedge funds,  research firms, journalists and others who he believed were conspiring  to ruin his company and turn a profit. This campaign, he added, was  orchestrated by a shadowy figure named after a “Star Wars” villain. (Mr.  Byrne and Overstock sued a hedge fund and research firm claiming they  had colluded to denigrate the company. They reached a $5 million  settlement with the hedge fund and an undisclosed settlement from the  research firm, the company said at the time.)
Overstock  survived the economic crisis of the late 2000s, but has struggled  during a recent boom in online furniture sales, as competitors like  Amazon.com, Wayfair and others emerged. At the same time, Mr. Byrne’s  focus shifted away from the company’s core business and toward the next  big idea: blockchain technology. Through an entity inside Overstock  called Medici Ventures, Mr. Byrne and his team began to invest in a  number of blockchain companies.
While  Mr. Byrne is stepping away from Overstock, he remains deeply entwined  with it. He continues to be its largest shareholder, holding 15 percent  of the company, and has a significant personal investment in one of the  blockchain technologies the company has invested in.
“They’ve  invested in a lot of blockchain companies. It’s early-stage stuff,”  said Allen Klee, an analyst at Maxim Group who covers Overstock.  “They’ve been losing money on it, but there could be two or three of  them that might eventually hit it out of the ballpark.”
Mr.  Byrne’s resignation sent the company’s stock up more than 8 percent.  The company named Jonathan E. Johnson III as its interim chief  executive. In an interview, Mr. Johnson said the resignation was  entirely Mr. Byrne’s decision.
But Mr. Byrne’s departure leaves many big questions for Overstock.
“Now  that he’s out of the picture, I think that will accelerate the sale of  the retail side of the business,” said Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A.  Davidson. Mr. Forte said its potential buyers could include Costco,  Target and T.J. Maxx.
Mr. Byrne said  he would continue to be involved in the company’s blockchain investments  and perhaps a new business that will apply the blockchain to the market  for electrical power. “But first I want to surf,” he said.And  Mr. Byrne has no plans to remain quiet. He said he intended to relaunch  his website, DeepCapture.com, and “continue to speak to the world.”

The benefit is that you can be sure that all transactions done on the network are verified, a \~300GB HDD and a low-end computer is required, no technical know how is required if you don't want to do exotic things.
@_date: 2019-08-28 09:38:27
that's BS, the whole .bitcoin dir is 273958811495 byte (\~270GB) and assuming a block every 10 min with a size of 2MB, one year of Blocks is 104832MB (\~100GB). You don't need to be online 24/7, just when you use it (send/receive transactions/query the daemon)
So with a 500GB HDD you are good to go. No SSD needed at all. You could increase the usable memory (--db-cache i think), if you have enough RAM.
A bitcoin full node can be run on a low powered arm device (i admit, it takes time with a RPi on 1GB ram (\~2 weeks), but it works (in contrast to ETH where you really need &gt;2TB SSD, and beefy HW to run a full node))
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:30:21

Before 2009 no taxes on profits in germany (&gt;= 1 yr holding an asset/investment/..)

It's a shame that a perfectly legal business is a 1st world country has to consider a trustless, uncensorable, decentralized payment system that is still in an experimental phase because regulations set the burden for payments (again: for a perfect legal business) so high and creating inconvenience for both, customers and entrepreneurs alike. (As mentioned the intersection of people using btc and cbd is (probably) not as high as people with traditional means of payments and the cbd market)

A node is just a box with a certain ruleset and doesn't know what the outer world consists of. The node gets data and independently works for itself out if the data is according to his own rules valid. Even if all nodes but your very own are cheaters your node wouldn't accept their data because the nodes ruleset says whats valid and what not. The only way to trick your node is if more than \~50% of miners decide that they censor transactions or worst case they reverse old already confirmed transactions. This attack would be very costly and undermines their business model because bitcoin would probably tank in this scenario and users would have to wait a long time to be certain that a tx is indeed irreversible (e.g. 50 blocks) .

this has nothing to do with miners, they are responsible for the "timeserver" aspect of bitcoin (ordering transactions) to prevent double spends and spam.
Enforcing the protocol is handled by your very own node! So if you have some bc or a related service you might run a full node out of self interest.
A node doesn't know anything about the outer world, receives data and acts according to the software implementation, all nodes do the same and form a network.
Some mining pools are pretty dumb, in the past they mined on top of invalid blocks, so they are pretty lazy and showed to not enforce shit!

High fees are not nice from a UX POV OBV but L2s are built and there is only one chance to get this right, that's also an argument from all "maximalists", we shouldn't fracture the market and concentrate on BTC, even if it might be really hard but all the alts just taking away  network effect.

GDP was just a measure the US Govt liked a lot because they realized (in WW2) it grows even if it's not useful to measure the well-being of it's citizens (financially).
Afaik they would measure the income of citizens before they switched to GDP and because they liked it a lot they told all allies to do the same.

The quality, honesty and ethos are unmatched.
Most of the "innovations" could be done as a sidechain, on top of btc or could be otherwise integrated into btc. Those alts are testbeds if anything and it's nice to have those, agreed.

afaik there is no such thing as signing with a segwit address, or any other address-format. It just happens that you can derive an address from a private key, which also allows you to sign arbitrary data.
@_date: 2019-04-24 13:22:19
no, an address is just derived from a private key. You can derive different addresses from the same private key. addresses are generally not that interesting in bitcoin, beside from maybe error correction and stuff like that. important is just the UTXO and if you are able to sign a transaction (to create new outputs).

a lightning TX is just a bitcoin TX that isn't broadcasted yet, therefore it's free or very cheap to transact. If you feel you want to settle, a updated TX that reflects what you did within the LN NW  gets broadcasted and settles on the blockchain. OBV thats very ELI5.

Sure, it's not flawless but interestingly users and companies in the space now think about how to use the blockchain more efficient and that's a huge improvement itself. I also wonder how LN performs when there are race conditions (like the special month you mentioned).

let's face it, no blockchain is good at providing low or no fees, provides secure payments and is still decentralized. there is infinite demand for blockspace if the aforementioned features would all be true. there is a trade off. If lightning is not working out (at the moment it works pretty well, let's wait for race conditions/really high fees) and btc is "just" a store of value like gold then it's enough for a lot of users.. lambo guys could point to the marketcap of gold and a gold tx is quite expensive too and mostly has a cost for keeping it safe at a vault..

it might shock you but bitcoin is not a product you are consuming and core devs aren't a company you can demand to produce stuff you like.
every blockchain faces the same limitations, only difference is bitcoin/lightning devs are transparent about it and don't want to scam while the majority of alts is driven by leaders which profit tremendously of off their userbase

 From the man himself:
 [JULY](
In July 2017, G.W. de-anonymized me by careful use of names on social media and gradually tying them together, finding the same thing as the earlier February 2015 de-anonymization as well. (Since the other items would’ve sufficed, I count his as a separate de-anonymization.) He declined the bounty.
 [NOVEMBER](
In November 2017, A.T. emailed me about a deanonymization some time ago, but unfortunately forgot how exactly he did it, and declined the bounty.
 [DECEMBER](
In December 2017, one person noted that some of my old 2013 Bitcoin sale transactions on   
happened to leak my name via bank accounts. Whups. (They did not claim the bounty.)

imo not
1. e.g. Exchanges, they hold most of those POS shitcoins and have therefore a lot of power and take away the decentralized aspect on the NW (and the consenus aspect too obv).
2. mining is a transparent form of issuance and security, all the data is in front of you, everyone can calculate how much it costs to secure the network and maybe there is a reward depending on the env you live in. POS obfuscates that cost.

edit: e.g. is their lead backend dev.  
or Backend and OB1 dev, more level-headed but nonetheless calling maximalists brain dead and the segwit implementation retarded...
they constantly attack bitcoin, their developers and take money from a company like bitmain.
@_date: 2019-09-02 22:58:43
the probability for successful double spends is reduced or to rephrase it, the cost to double spend (e.g. reorg &gt;6 blocks) increases. Bitcoin Gold (something like BCH/bcash/bitcoin cash) was 51% attacked and lost $20mil worth of it. BCH is centralized with checkpoints but it would be cheap to attack them (\~1,5% of the hashrate of BTC would be enough)
\[51% attack is just the name for this attack, 40% could also be enough to do this kind of attack but with a lower probability for "success"\]

you can, if you bring something interesting to the table (like segwit back then) but you don't, you just add noise to a platform where the n/s ratio is inherently bad to start with.
absolut numbers like the stated 1$ fee is nonsense too, depending on your urgency to get a transaction onto the most secure, immutable and decentralized ledger on earth the amount can vary vastly and it just proofs that blockspace is a valuable resource. However, personally i seldomly pay more than 1s/vb which is ridiculously cheap considering the beforementioned attributes of this ledger and perfectly safe even if i need it to be faster confirmed thanks to RBF.

seeing you mentioning trust is awkward, there should be no trust, otherwise you could use supernodes to verify/sign TXs and forget the miners,.. the crisis is real and if mining isn't going to decentralize more again but becomes more centralized the big experiment is over, no matter how well the protocol is doing in terms of efficiency.

if you want to settle your TX within the next block (\~10min) on the most secure, decentralized and immutable ledger on the world i'd argue that 3$ is ridiculous cheap. Go for a few hours and it is a few cents. On the other hand you could use roger vers version of a cryptocurrency which is centralized, mutable (via coordinated reorgs) and insecure for free.
beside that, the talented and smart devs work on bitcoin and not a random shitcoin
@_date: 2017-07-05 05:04:47
what do you mean exactly? i'd say that consensus is tough to achieve and you better hodl onto your private keys (on these dates)
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:52:22

@_date: 2019-05-01 11:36:09
shitcoins are generally centered around a leader or foundation, which profit massive with promises they never achieve. People working on bitcoin are brutally honest, e.g. most lightning devs wish there wouldn't be this sort of hype. Eth got destroyed before the project even launched (because it simply CAN'T work out if one wants to keep the core aspects of cryptocurrencies (decentralization, immutability, ...). A ETH full node requires a &gt;2TB SSD already.
Lightning is ONE possible scaling tech, there are lots of ideas.
Most core devs wish there would be more capacity but can't reach consensus on how to achieve this goal. Segwit is really neat. Roger et. al. were just pissed off that pieter presented it like "we did it, this is a (max) 4x increase, solves malleability AND is a softfork, beside that it adds possibilities like, ..."  and there was nowhere any sort of competition bc segwit was the smartest and best way but other people had different ideas and couldn't really present them as pieter de facto solved the problem the best way and presented it before others had the chance to. Now politics came into play, which sucked but proofed btc is pretty resilient to a lot of social attacks.
Bitcoin is research driven and doesn't build on ideas that "maybe work out". This approach + consensus takes time. Bitcoin is not a "build fast, break things" type of software. Unfortunately this means that maybe btc can't handle all the people that would like to have fast/instant, secure and cheap transactions. The Blockchain is a resource we should handle carefully. Btc should not adapt to companies, users,.. and their needs. If one wants to flourish in this space you have to adapt to btc (batching, multiplex channels between you and your exchange, sidechains,...). There are TONS of possibilities but we already know that blockchains don't scale well and we need to tackle this problem from different angles. Everyone would put everything (books, music, videos, money,..) on the blockchain if it would cheap, fast, secure, decentralized, immutable,...
Also: Because there are so many theoretically possibilities but only so much funding and workforce things could speed up if the space would be just more honest and work on bitcoin related things instead of the newest "solves all problems, newest shit" ideas that don't work out but create as much hype as possible to sell you something. All the devs working on btc instead of one-way streets with an end wouldn't get rich quick but would make a real difference.
Its also is nonsense to have a coin for every application, i want money because money can be changed to all other goods and services. A shitcoin for this and for that is just nonsense. If btc ultimately centers around a sort of gold with much better properties that would be cool too obv.
So much things need to be addressed, this is still an experiment but the coolest in decades.
@_date: 2019-05-02 10:13:28
to answer that question you would have to know everyone who is working on the repo and it's forks and what they have in mind. there are 300 open pull requests on bitcoin/bitcoin alone right now. Schnorr (and what comes with it) is just a more prominent thing and requires a softfork, thats kinda cool and we will see how that works out :)
If you are looking for some buzzwords then maybe:  Neutrino, MAST, taproot, multiple aggregation technologies, Simplicity, scriptless scripts, confidential transactions, bulletproofs,  Mimble-Wimble sidechain, dandelions,  submarine swaps, cross chain transactions, MuSig,...
Edit: BIPs are maybe a place to look at but i know a few (maybe a lot) devs don't really care about them so theres that..
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:35:27
nonetheless they need to launch a 2.0 after realizing what BTC OGs told them before the launch is becoming a reality after all (eth can't work out mid/long-term for various reasons)

Nothing. Good to have those channels, cheap and fast transaction, kudos.
If you want to close a channel:
there is a huge difference between paying a fee for the next block (should be expensive imo) and a TX that can settle within a 2 week timeframe. afaik worse case - you have to rebroadcast the tx.

ETH is a shitcoin, premined, virtually NO **full validating** nodes, mutable (barf) with a foundation (double barf) and brings nothing new to the table. All they do since launching is promising stuff that can't work out long term. at best it's going to be a corporate coin, no householdwill be able to run a full validating eth node. [It already is expensive as fuck](

or p2pool for more regular small payments 
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:54:59
no, you are just to dumb to imagine a bright future with an immutable ledger that is small enough to keep it decentralized and having sidechains, LN, RSK,.. as scaling mechanisms that do have trade-offs in terms of security/scalability and everyone who told you all three are perfect doable onchain (decentralized, max. security and being cheap) is lying or an idiot too..
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:21:26
sure, get-rich-qick morons might jump ship but true bitcoiners (more about the idea than the money) are most likely not. Maybe its inevitable to split but i think given enough time there will be tech that can deal with both on the same mothership (bitcoin) and different clients with different trade offs for different users and use cases. One can dream and before we went toxic on each other we thought about ideas and how bitcoin might change the world. On the other hand there are people who bought into the idea that bitcoin is free and for everyone but this isn't reality now but hopefully in the future.

Hallo Schorsch, Bielefeld gibt es gar nicht ;P 
@_date: 2019-05-10 09:22:23
all i know is those and lots more key values are inherent to bitcoin but all i see altcoins are doing is centering around a leader; those leaders profit (scam) from their fanbase and on the technical side its all just promises. Now i wonder how long it takes for ethereum to come up with version 3 because after a decade they realize the things bitcoin OGs told them beforehand are becoming a reality after all..
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:07:14
afaik a hard-fork needs nearly 100% support to succeed and i don't see seg2x to reach that goal. That being said i think 2MB wouldn't do any harm generally (and here i do think nearly 100% agree) but the timeframe for seg2x is too short. Pretty sure there will be better proposals. I'm also not really excited about the NYA flag, why would bitmain ever activate segwit? Imo he is buying time and fools us. Bip149 seems to be the sane way to get segwit :)
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:51:55
this metric is pure nonsense
more interesting would be something like btc vs gold or btc vs M1 but issuing a new token, calling it noETHos5.0 with a lot of buzzwords and a supply of 100billion to create a absurd high mktcap with no liquidity is BS.
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:57:52
100% uptime, blockspace is valueable for ppl, price is up 4x since a month, but it is not doing what would like it to do. ya heard reddit? now bring the pitchfork and some fire, we are going to burn down this bitcoin thing MUHAHA lol

sure, but i think the world runs on incentives and not on "it would be nice if".. There are real and very good reasons to run a full node but altruism isn't one.
@_date: 2017-06-02 07:18:00
btw.. a real bitcoiner doesn't trust jihan/anyone, he verifies.. forgot that i guess
@_date: 2017-06-23 09:09:45
sure but in case of bip148 its ~30% of users and some may consider this as enough and so its essential to run a node and enforce the rules you want, no?
@_date: 2019-05-02 08:01:30
nothing addressed in terms of bitcoin, just market BS.
You could have done a really good video about the REAL stuff that could go wrong,.. 
dunno .. BGP routing, inflation bugs,..
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:30:55
and most core devs agree that onchain scaling won't hurt but there is no consensus of how to do it and segwit is just brilliant if you consider that it fixes bugs, is an onchain increase AND IT'S A SOFTFORK, how awesome is that? 
@_date: 2019-05-01 17:07:40

hey james, i payed for pizza the other day with bitcoin and the payment did not succeed bc you thought the fee was too (272sat/byte) low. Would you mind sending ppls money back in this case? Or you just steal it right away? tx:54e5e9dbc4a724b1944207bf676060ccd1cee33bd0050e521aa42adeb545d38f
and as a side note: this wasn't my first payment with bitpay for pizza and i never tried to double spend or anything and bitpay could be more or less sure about me and that a 272sat/byte fee TX to eventually confirm. wtf 
@_date: 2017-07-07 06:21:17
hefty nonsense here, did they point a gun at you saying "you better run core", i don't think so. Run any software you like, fork of the network with bigger blocks at any time you wish, "core" is a bunch of ppl writing code they like and if you don't like it - don't run it. Nobody can tell any of the devs what they have to do, they do what they want to do and anyone is free to do the same. 
edit: although most of them have very high standards and we are very lucky to have these ppl working on the bitcoin repo 
@_date: 2017-06-20 08:48:41
mh imo 80% hashing power != 80% of the bitcoin ecosystem but maybe thats just me..

miners follow the money, there wouldn't be money in the first place if users wouldn't value the protocol and users can dictate the protocol with an UASF, miners can say no but ultimately they are just working for users and will follow

i choose which node software i run, if my node says the payment isn't valid it isn't - therefore it accomplishes exactly what i want, tbh i have no idea why you would say something like this, even if i end up with a minority my node would accomplish exactly what i want it to do. maybe you could clarify for me what you mean when you say:


@_date: 2017-06-23 23:18:27
obv can old nodes and old tx only function under old rules.. now if we would have never developed faster cars everyone would drive a slow car but the world does not work that way, people bought newer, faster cars and yes, you can still drive a really old car but you are slower and unsafer then everybody else on the road.. (the new car is segwit, just in case, because things seem to shock you)

@_date: 2017-06-20 16:39:11
well to be fair, a bip148-node running from now till 1.aug wont harm anyone and may be enough pressure to get a real signal and not just a signal to signal
@_date: 2019-05-10 09:08:36
alts have no liquidity and therefore market cap is a stupid measurement. 
honestly i don't know what alts cost but to my knowledge there is no alt competing with bitcoin on key values like a scientific and conservative (code wise) approach, quality/review process/standards, **reliable/foreseeable for businesses,** ethos, **decentralization** and **immutability,** to name just a few. Probably a result of the social aspect of the bitcoin development. The OGs of digital money are working on bitcoin and not the newest shitcoin. bitcoin and alts are really on the opposite of the spectrum on so many important key aspects.

[maybe this is shocking for you](
@_date: 2017-06-26 04:13:53
would you mind telling me how long it took you to pay the merchant for me? I'd like to remind you, it was for pizza, a few bucks.. Pretty sure it took ages, makes no sense at all and after about 40min of no confirmation from the merchant-side i just payed via SEPA. Anyway, it's not worth the hassle and you just lost my business, as easy as that. Who TF waits hours to receive a f****** pizza? Just pay the damn merchant instant, you had a history with me, should have checks is place for double-spends &amp; co., it was a few bucks and the fee was reasonable there was no reason to delay the payment ..

happened to me too, ~20$, said they would pay it back after 2-3 days but nope, didn't got it. Never ever again BitPay, nowadays they suck and their CEO is from my POV even anti-BTC (but he wasn't a few months back)
@_date: 2017-06-26 06:57:53


then just pay it back to the addy it originated from, you might win a customer back and it might be worth the loss, its up to you. You can try to get the money back from the merchant, i won't bother, its not worth the hassle for me. Considering i always recommended bitpay and not only stopped doing so but since the service isn't working anymore for me and your CEO isn't neutral anymore i proactively try to convince friends not to use your service anymore 


at which point in time did "lieferservice.at" change their policy? Orders payed with bitpay were instant before. 


I appreciate it! 
@_date: 2019-05-02 11:29:15
 it's a decentralized, immutable, safe and censorship resistant ledger. 
100$ fees would still be low, even if it would take a whole day for the TX to settle.
