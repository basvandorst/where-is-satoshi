Have I got this right?  A transaction that ends in 1337 satoshi is a signal that if Bob wants to return the coins then he can?
Unless I'm missing something this seems like a done deal to me.  
From now on if I mistakenly send coins to the wrong address why wouldn't I try sending 1337 satoshis?  Worst case nothing happens.  Best case I get some or all of my coins back.

The problem with increasing the divisibility will not be with the core or the miners, it will be with all the other external software out there: exchanges, wallets, ATMs, apps, and whatever else uses bitcoin.
Remember Y2K?  Well, perhaps you don't.  It will be the same kind of problem.

I managed to brute force the enrollment key in about 5 or 6 tries.
Here's another clue:

So I don't understand a word of what you just said.  That's why nobody uses it.

Agreed.  But that's not my point.  My point is that if, right now, today, I missent some coins I could already right now send 1337 and maybe I'll get some of my coins back.  
The protocol works already, right?  Nothing more needs to be done to implement it, or am I missing something?

You could at least try this:
It's a way of indicating to the owner of that address (if there is an owner) that you'd like your coins back please.  It may not work, but you've nothing to lose.

Buffett is right that bitcoin is not a currency; it's more like currency 2.0.  
I like to think of fiat as 'soft currency' and bitcoin as 'hard currency'.  Soft currency can be printed and manipulated. Hard currency can't; it just is.

Regarding the standard evidence threshold, in case B, what happens if Alice does not control any of the upstream addresses?
If Alice were a newbie and created a weak brainwallet and then received 1 BTC directly from an exchange into that wallet, then she doesn't control any upstream addresses right?

Can anyone make a graphic illustrating this point?  Perhaps a graph with a scale of 6 months for cards and PayPal and a scale of 60 minutes for Bitcoin, something like that anyways.

I've looked at the MMM scheme and I see no reference to Bitcoin.  Why would MMM cause an increase in demand for Bitcoin?  I don't understand the connection.
