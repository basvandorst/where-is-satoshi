it could be encrypted?
The problem with emailing a receipt is that it requires you to have an account with the seller, each seller will have their own formatted email, it requires set up on the seller's behalf. A paper receipt you just get, with minimal hassle, and basically every receipt is the same, a simple list of items against price with maybe some shop specific detail/advertisement at the top and bottom or on the back. The downside to the paper receipt is that it uses paper, if it's not something people will return they'll tend not to take them, not many people take the time and effort to go through all their receipts and manually see what they're spending more on.
Another thing a receipt is useful for is order numbers in some shops like Argos, KFC, Five Guys you get an order number, if they made the switch to bitcoin it would be much more fluid process if the order number was directly attached to the transaction, an email may not get there in time, the user won't have to switch to an email app to get the order number.
EDIT: by linking the transaction to the receipt and the receipt to the items bought in a common format, more can be done with the data. It's the links that are important.

So a seller would put the receipt in the memo field in PaymentDetails?
It would be great if every receipt had a standard format.

You just said it is subject to sales text, yet the OP says "is not subject to sales tax" ??

A meshnet that is as fast as a traditional network would be objectively better than a traditional network. Signal could reach places it previously hasn't been able to (Underground/in buildings). It can't be shut off directly. If something major happens or there is an area if a large number of people in, the network won't grind to a halt. Also things like SMS don't need to be instantaneous.

It's not been overcome because there hasn't been a need to.

It would only take one state to not like this, hijack it and start broadcasting their propaganda to the entire planet.
@_date: 2014-02-02 15:34:49
Yeah I found this weird. It seemed to mix the idea of providing internet connection so anyone can say anything (as they can almost do now) but without censorship/etc; with a more radio like broadcast system that is controlled by a minority. 
If anything I think this system would create an even worse choke point for censorship than the existing internet. This project is a bad idea.
@_date: 2014-02-02 15:36:48
There are ways around filtering and blocking with ISPs because you are able to transmit information (so you can choose where to get information from, i.e. you can create a VPN connection, or connect to a proxy). With this system you have as much control over what you receive as you do listening to the radio, i.e. none.
@_date: 2014-12-09 14:19:54
so there is no tax on currency conversion??

Sponsoring these events seems a bit pointless, the people in those events and watching them are more likely to know about bitcoin already. 
Rather put adverts in major cities around the world, or something which will reach people not normally involved with technology.

Doesn't paypal work there? I mean it can't be because of sanctions like some countries else how would WU be allowed to work there 
@_date: 2014-02-02 15:39:51
Basically a few people will get to choose what content is broadcast. It's not really clear on who these few people would be. But the entire point of the Internet has become to get away from "a few people controlling what millions see" (newspapers, TV, radio, etc).

I don't understand Western Union, why can't you just transfer the money between bank accounts or over PayPal

Perhaps they could get the required info through ssh or something.

It was a pretty great experience when I used it as a media centre, sure it's not quite as refined as the commercial media centres, but the customisation and ability to stream from not so legal websites more than makes up for it.

Shouldn't the title be Bitcoin-for-Cash service?

I probably don't understand right, but if Paypal were to accept Bitcoin what would be the point in all the exchanges like Mt Gox?
(not ranting/negative/etc, seriously asking)

Like I said it was just what I thought of that second. I disagree with anything that discriminates against a group of people. I thought it was also especially cruel that the 27 same sex marriages that took place in that week are now invalid... (so much for eternal bond and all that)
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:15:56
How do you know how to do this. Bitcoin sounds great but I don't want to spend money on nothing (transfer fees etc)

"Hi mom, dad. Can we turn the porn filter off please?"
that wont go down well with my parents.
But that's beside the point, many people won't realise this, nor understand it. And beyond that no government should have control over what gets blocked in their country.
ISPs/Computers have had opt-in blocking systems for a while, it's now become opt-out. It's much easier to have a no-option blocking system from an opt-out system, than it is to just introduce one from nothing.
The changes are made gradually, so that the anger is spread out, and less people notice. By the time the anger has died down and it becomes part of normal life, the next "small" change is on it's way.

I'm 19 at the moment, so not really a child, nor adult yet.
I bought bitcoin after losing my card on a saturday and not being able to get any money until the monday when the banks opened. (This actually happened twice, once before and once after buy bitcoin).
The second time it was the day before my friends and I had a christmas dinner. the people who cooked paid for everything up front. Not having any cash and no card to get an ATM, I was going to pay on the Monday, but between not sleeping, getting to a bank, packing and getting a train to go home for Christmas, I forgot. Now I could use bitcoin to pay them.
Basically I bought a small amount of bitcoin (within an hour before it crashed, but the loss does not bother me) because I would much rather be able to access and send my money on my own terms than have be dictated when and how I can access my money by the bank which is making profit from the people using them.
Also although I said what you quoted me, I was exaggerating, because I turned it off myself when I "setup" the internet connection.

I lost my card yesterday (Saturday evening), I tried dialling my bank's lost card number and got no reply. Managed to find one branch open in the whole of London that was opened on Sunday, but when I got there just before opening time, the staff walked out sharply/rudely saying "we're not opening today". eventually I got through to the lost card line, and cancelled my card. But for today I had no way to access **my** money, I have to go in tomorrow and get cash out with my account numbers. 
It's ridiculous how we give our money to these companies and trust them to look after it and let us use it, they make billions yet are unable to keep branches open at useful times (like after work in the evening or on weekends), they charge fees for anything they can, and generally we let them walk all over us. If bitcoin was as common as national currencies I would not have had any of this problems.

What does it say about "hackers" and "illegal"?

put the B off centre would "represent" the decentralised nature of bitcoin.

I bought 0.05 BTC at 13:00 (GMT). I apologise.

Yeah I started using Tor to get around the blocking of a TV/Movie streaming site. But it's slow, so once I've found the link to the video I copy it into my browser.

paying with bitcoin sounds amazing.
But I have no idea how to get from GBP to bitcoins without loosing a tonne of money to bank fees? I know paypal don't allow it, but if I could get bitcoin with paypal then it would be as easy as paying bitcoins sounds.
Basically is there a guide that says "starting with GBP/USD here's how to buy things with bitcoin"?

Non US person here, Who is Ron Paul? and why is a valid person to talk about bitcoin?

not sure about porn (use a proxy anyway), but try going to primewire.ag, and if you use one of the major ISPs like BT it will say Error - site blocked.
Whether you can access them in someway is irrelevant, it's the notion that the government and courts think they the authority to issue orders to block websites.

Sounds like a great way to give away money, without getting any bitcoins

People could find exploits and use them to their personal advantage without any reward. The reward makes the good guys more likely to find the exploit before the bad guys.

You see it starts "think of the children" (porn sites) and with movie/tv streaming sites, then other "illegal" activities, and slowly but surely the definition of "illegal" increases so that anything the authorities don't like or don't understand can be blocked.
In the UK we now have the following blocked:
Porn  
Sexual Health (As they got caught in the Porn filter)  
TV/Movie streaming sites  
and now Bitcoin  
That's a long list for a free country...
@_date: 2013-09-16 15:40:37
I agree. The bit coin community needs to work at getting PayPal to allow/support Bitcoins (though I can understand why they don't, as if everyone used Bitcoin PayPal wouldn't need to exist). Then BitCoins will become easily usable by most people.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:29:05
Yeah I've only started drinking in the last seven weeks and twice I've lost my card on a Saturday night when banks are closed on Sunday... 
HSBC's solution to getting cash was "borrow some from your friends"
Though Barclays give you a replacement card in branch and they are in RBS which had all those issues because of the old computer systems or something. And has decent mobile banking (again unlike HSBC), also I think Barclays have the best ISA interest rate.

We have our problems, but so do other countries. Out of America, Canada, Australia and the UK, on paper I'd prefer Canada.
Australia recently overturned gay marriage in the ACT.  
America's government cares nothing for the people, theres far too much money and corporate interest involved.  
American health care is just ridiculous. 
America has a problem with guns, that it refuses to do anything about.
(this is no way an exhaustive list, just what I can think of this second)
Having had to call an ambulance twice for my dad, and hearing about people refusing ambulances and health care in the US because they can't afford it, I am extremely glad I live in the UK. We might have high taxes but it pays for the NHS, and that overrides all the negative's such as the level of internet censorship we have at the moment.
I'd rather move somewhere like Iceland or Sweden or something, countries that aren't in the five eyes.
