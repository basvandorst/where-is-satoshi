Where does the fed money come from? Out of nowhere, from where and how does the fed gain income? From interest on loaned bills they printed literally out of thin air backed by nothing.
Anything and everything the fed does is a bailout from YOU. Stop explaining logically away the crimes of the federal reserve.

You're honestly defending the federal reserve banking system, now ive seen everything.

Even if you point the "unfunded liabilities", it's still  unsustainable and  the USA has not paid a single dollar worth of the debt and has only paid on interest to the tune of trillions of dollars. 
Prove me wrong.

I doubt the FED system was established as a means of 3rd party trust between banks.

Bankers are not stupid
Bankers are not naive
Bankers smell where the money comes from and they know there's a lot of value in bitcoin, they will just never admit it publicly too much.

the point of NWO money is that its NWO controlled, there is no NWO control here, compared with the hundreds of other cryptos bitcoin is not even close.

Not lawless, I disagree on this. I much prefer "anarcho tyranny". There is lawlessness, yes, everywhere,  this is the anarchy, but if "good people" attemptted to right the wrongs and ills that they disagree with, such as corruption like this, the government comes down the hardest on these people. there is the tyranny.

China became the sweatshop of the world, how do you think it happened? If that's the working conditions you like and love go for it. Go work at foxconn  here people threw themselves out of windows until bets where installed.
