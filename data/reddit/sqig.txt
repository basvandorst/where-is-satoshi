I don't know what "people like me" means. If you're saying that step two is "every retailer wants bit coins," then yes, that will never happen. If step two is "inconsequential retailers dip their toes into bit coins to get earned media hits," then yes, that is certainly happening.

Transactions fees are on a sliding scale based on volume. They start at about three percent (higher for Amex) and fall the more business you do. For businesses of scale, merchant processing fees are negligible, and bit coins won't save a useful amount of money.

Money is both things. It is both wealth — a "store of value" — and an accounting system — a "medium of exchange." Those are two of the three defining characteristics of money.


No, you're confusing the accounting with the value again. Money is actually inherently valuable in and of itself. If you have $5,000 on account at a bank, you have an asset worth $5,000 that can be exchanged, in whole or part, for goods and services. Money is not just information; it's actual value in a stored form. (Not the *best* stored form; that's why people invest their savings. But money is still stored value.)


No, ledgers are ledgers. Money is the actual value stored behind the numbers in the ledger. We call money a "unit of account," which is just a fancy way of saying it's the thing we denominate to write down in ledgers. But money is not ledgers, nor ledgers money. They're related but very different.


Not remotely. My bank's books are distinct from your bank's books. There is nothing centralized about either money or ledgers.
(Bit coins, incidentally, are *also* fiat money. Fiat money is distinct from commodity money. Bit coins are not commodity money, so they're fiat money. If they're money at all, which is very much open to debate.)


In exactly the same way that every other ledger is decentralized. In point of fact, in an all-and-only-bit-coins economy, the ledger would be very much centralized; there's only one and all participants must agree on every aspect of it. This is not true of money, where my books are totally separate from your books.


You don't mean "digital" here. You mean "computerized." And being computerized is hardly a virtue. Computers are buggy and complicated and hard to use. Don't try to sell somebody on an idea by saying it's computerized; that's a vice more than it is a virtue.


Which is a problem. We moved away from gold-backed money for a reason, after all.


It depends on how you define your terms. It's not more energy-efficient; bit coin mining is hugely energy-wasteful. And it's not more time-efficient; bit coin transactions are far slower than traditional transactions.


Financial privacy is not virtuous. The system we have now already balances privacy against the public good in the best way we've ever been able to come up with. Saying "This is more private!" necessarily means it's less good for society as a whole, because you're throwing the balance out of whack.


Which, again, is not inherently a good thing.

That's how it works. The thing to remember is that both the supply of and the demand for dollars are ever-increasing. To keep the economy healthy, it's important that those two things increase together at the right rate. So the government, through a wholly independent agency called the central bank, steps in to nudge the supply of money up or down to keep it at a level that matches demand. This is called monetary policy, and it's the reason we haven't had another Great Depression in eighty years.

When the bank has $1,000 in deposits and makes $800 in loans, that money doesn't come out of the accounts of the depositors. If one of the borrowers defaults on his loan, the depositors don't have to take a loss. The $800 lent is *new money* backed by debt. You can't create new bit coins, so that can't work with bit coins.
I mean, think about it rationally for a fraction of a second. That imaginary "bit coin bank" you came up with has 1,000 bit coins spread out across hundreds of individual accounts. How do they come up with 800 bit coins to lend out? By making withdrawals from each depositor's account?

That would be *brilliant.* Seriously, it would solve 90% of bit coins' problems. Unfortunately, you simply can't. The system isn't set up in such a way to make that possible.

More correctly, they're relationships between the time rate of change in supply and the time rate of change in demand. If supply is growing faster than demand, you're looking at an inflationary market. If supply is growing more slowly than demand, that's a deflationary market. The typical shortcut is just to look at the market price of the good you're interested in. If it's climbing, that's probably a deflationary market.

Buying them is extremely difficult (and hellishly expensive), nobody takes them so finding a buyer for yours is equally difficult, and once a buyer has been found you have to be a computer scientist to actually conduct the transaction.
Don't mistake "I have mastered this complex thing" for "this complex thing is easy to master."

It's not anonymous unless you take specific steps to conceal your identity. It's not instant; transactions take a minimum of ten minutes to clear and that's not counting the time required to buy in and cash out. And it's not free because you have to attach a processing bounty to every transaction to force it through the system, in addition to the cost of converting to and from bit coins on either end.
So no, I'm afraid I can't go along with nearly any of those things. It's really not *remotely* any of those things.
Let me give you this by comparison. If I had your mobile number (and the inclination) I could send you money through my bank. The text would take about a minute to get to your phone, and it would cost both of us nothing at all (assuming we're not paying for text messages; if we are, then it's a few cents, or I can send it to your email address instead). Money in, money out, effectively instant and literally free.
That's what you have to compare to.

Only in a system where saved money becomes available as lending capital. When you save money in a bank, you're capitalizing that bank to enable to to create new money through lending. Stuffing money under your mattress would hurt the economy because you're taking money out of circulation and reducing the size of the capital market. Every dollar taken out this way is a dollar that can't be used to, say, start a new business or hire a new employee.
"Saving" bit coins is not like saving money. Bit coins don't go into a bank to capitalize new lending. "Saved" bit coins simply disappear. Some of them may reappear at some time in the future, while some won't ever. Either way, the bit coin economy suffers.

That's called deflation, and it's bad. It makes economies grind to a halt because nobody's willing to sell their appreciating assets.


Basically, yes, but only because we've got systems in place that make "hoarding" money work. We "hoard" money in banks and in securities and in other forms that benefit the economy and keep capital flowing. Hoarded bit coins just vanish from existence, feeding the deflationary spiral that causes the bit coin economy to sputter to a halt.

The volatility is inherent. There is no economic force that pushes the market price of bit coins toward stability. They will always be all over the place, because there is no rational basis for pricing. The price of a bushel of wheat is a function of the supply of wheat — actually being grown — and the demand for wheat, which in turn is a function of what wheat is intrinsically good for. Bitcoins have no supply, and the demand is based purely on *want* rather than *use.* So their market price will always be a horrorshow.

If bit coins were more popular, we'd have a *bigger* unemployment problem, not a smaller one.
See, unemployment is directly linked to the availability of capital. Hiring happens when new businesses can start, or when existing businesses can expand. Under ideal circumstances this happens as a predictable rate. But that can only happen if capital is available consistently and for low prices.
If bit coins were popular as a store of value, capital would be *more expensive* and less readily available. The reason is obvious: By definition, bit coins being more popular as a store of value means draining money out of the capital market and squirreling it away in bit coins.
Since we already have a problem of capital not being available as widely and as cheaply as it needs to be, further reducing the size of the capital market would *make unemployment worse,* because it would be more expensive for new businesses to start or for existing businesses to expand.
What we need to bring unemployment down further is cheaper and more widely available capital. This is already happening; lending reserves are expanding at a steady rate thanks to Fed open-market operations, and historically low interest rate returns on cash holdings are prompting long-term investors to restructure their portfolios in ways that are capital-market friendly. It's just that what's happening now needs to *continue* happening in order for business to expand and unemployment to fall back to nominal levels.
If somebody waved a magic wand and made bit coins, say, a million times more widely used as a store of value, that'd *hurt* the economic recovery toward full employment, not help it.

Don't think of deflation as being related to prices. That's just confusing. Think of it as being related to the *price of money.* When the market price of a dollar goes up, that's deflation.
Under ordinary circumstances, the market price of a dollar falls gradually, around 2-5% per year. Why? Because we're making new dollars faster than people are grabbing them up. But the rate at which we're making new dollars is balanced against the rate at which people are demanding them. So the fall in the market price is controlled.
Deflation happens when the market price of a dollar stops falling and starts increasing with time. Why is that bad? Because it shuts down the sale of money. If your money is going to be worth more tomorrow than it was today, why would you sell it? Just wait, and get a better price for it tomorrow.
Since the *purpose of an economy* is to put people with money in touch with people who want money, deflation defeats the whole point of having an economy. If people aren't motivated to sell their money, the economy fundamentally isn't working.

Serious question: Why? Nobody can claim with a straight face that they're leaving money on the table by not doing it. So why bother?
@_date: 2014-01-21 18:27:24
Remember that money isn't about being wealthy. It's about *doing things.* If you want to do anything interesting or useful in this life, you need money. People who want to do interesting or useful things hardly ever *have* the money they need to do them, and even if they did they'd be disinclined to take the risk entirely onto themselves. That's why it's vitally important that we *make money available* to people who want to do interesting or useful things. We do this through the capital market: loans, publicly traded stocks, private equity investment and so on. The whole point of the economy is to make it so people who have money actively seek out people who need money to do interesting or useful things. But bit coins defeat that sole purpose by making your "money" *more valuable if you don't use it.* In a hypothetical all-bit coin world, nobody would ever have access to capital. Which would be catastrophic.

Christ, this is a simple concept. A zero-sum situation is any in which all transactions must sum to zero. If I acquire ten bit coins, somebody out there must lose ten bit coins. That's what it means to say bit coins are zero-sum. They cannot be created. They just exist.
Now, is that true in the most absolute sense? No, because bit coins are still being created. But the *rate* at which they're being created is wholly negligible. So we can treat bit coins as zero-sum for all purposes.

Those firms don't actually "take in" bit coins at all. They never see them. They receive dollars. A trusted thirty party accepts customers' bit coins, exchanges them for dollars, then passes the dollars along to the retailer on the customer's behalf.

Nobody cares about "decentralized", and "hard for the government to control" just means "out of control." Those aren't selling points. "Be your own bank" means giving up all the services and assurances banking provides, not least of which is deposit insurance, so that's not a selling point either. Literally the only reason anybody would be even a tiny bit interested in bit coins is if they think they're going to make a profit off them, so yes, evangelizing sets off the scam detectors.

Because with a guaranteed return just from sitting on your principal, you have to demand a much higher potential return to offset the risk associated with selling on the capital market. In an inflationary economy, you will lose value if you do nothing, so it doesn't take much to earn you a net profit. But in a deflationary economy, doing nothing will earn you big bucks, so you have to demand *just that much more* before you're willing to take the risk. Deflation prices capital out of the market.

That's not an investment, strictly speaking. Certificates of deposit are just bank accounts of a particular type and quality. You agree to lock your money away for a fixed amount of time (giving it to the bank to use as lending capital) in exchange for some modest return on your principal. The purpose of a CD is not to be a profit-making investment, or even an inflation-meeting investment, but rather to be a secure store of value for the short to medium term (30 days to 5 years).
Using a CD is not an alternative to investing. It's an alternative to keeping your money in a demand deposit account when you know for a fact you're not going to be using it.

The intrinsic value of a bit coin comes from its nominal utility. Coiners dislike this fact, though, because it means bit coins basically have no intrinsic value. When you look at them through the lens of nominal utility you find that they're significantly less useful than other methods of payment, due to the time and effort required to acquire them before you can use them in transactions. The intrinsic value of a dollar (or any other legal-tender monetary unit) comes from the fact that they're trivially easy to acquire and spend. Bit coins are *not* easy to acquire and spend, so that means they've got less intrinsic value than a dollar has.

That would not reduce volatility, no.

Easy. Somebody fraudulently submits a bit coin transaction. The transaction fails to go through. But everybody is stuck waiting around for ten or twenty minutes to find out that it fails to go through.


Not that flexible. Remember, to compete with EFTPOS they *must* remain less than about 1%, because bit coins offer none of the services or convenience EFTPOS offers at about 3%.


It isn't. You can't *half-*do a transaction. You can't say to the barista "I promise you'll get paid" and then walk out with your coffee. Until the transaction is confirmed, it's not done.

Not really, because first of all bit coins aren't money, and second there's no capital market for them, and third they're traded by so few people so seldom that there's basically no efficient market at work there at all. So concepts like inflation and deflation don't apply. You can say that bit coins *would* be deflationary *if* they were money, but that's a subtly different statement.
The purpose of an economy is to make interesting activities possible by creating a flow of capital. No flow of capital, no interesting activities. Since there's no flow of capital through the bit coins "economy," we can't meaningfully say there's an economy there at all, really.
The thing to remember about the macroeconomics of bit coins is that there aren't any. We can talk, in principle, about what the macroeconomics of bit coins *would be* if they behaved that way, but that's not the same as saying they do behave that way.

You need to understand a couple of things. First, the vast majority of people don't want bit coins. They have no interest in them whatsoever.

Just the opposite. If the monetary unit you denominate your holdings in is inflating — that is, steadily losing value at a couple-three percent per year — you're motivated to *sell* your savings on the capital market for a return that meets or beat the rate of inflation. You can hold your money as cash in a bank account and lose two or three points after a year, or you can sell it for a better return that puts that money to good use somewhere out there in the economy.
That's why a modest rate of inflation is fundamentally good for the economy. It keeps capital moving around and disincentivizes the hoarding of cash.

Deflation is what happens when the supply of a monetary unit grows more slowly than the demand for it. That can happen if the supply shrinks — "lost coins" — but it also happens any time demand is growing faster than supply.
To make this clearer, imagine that there's some abstract and absolute unit of worth: box tops, say. Right now, one bit coin is worth ten box tops. A year from now, one bit coin is going to be worth twenty box tops, because bit coins are deflating; that is, the supply isn't growing faster than the demand. What does this mean if you borrow one bit coin today? It means if you paid it back *today* you'd be giving over something worth ten box tops. But if you pay it back in a year, you'll have to give over something worth *twenty* box tops. That makes borrowing a losing proposition. That's bad, because the purpose of an economy is to get borrowers and lenders together and have them do business with each other. Borrowing makes sense if the thing you're borrowing today will be less valuable to you when you have to pay it back; that's why inflation is fundamentally a good thing for a monetary system.

That is not possible with bit coins, no. See the idea behind fractional reserve banking is that no actual money changes hands when it's lent. Rather, new money is created backed by the loan. Since bit coins cannot be created, you can't lend them. If such a bank as you describe existed, the depositors' balances would have to go down every time some bit coins were lent. That'd hardly be acceptable to anyone, obviously.

Bit coins *could have had* more potential for value, yes. Unfortunately the flaws in the system are just too significant and cannot be fixed with incremental changes.
The best thing that will come from bit coins is that some smart people will get together and go "Oh, I see what you were trying to do here," then do it right.
@_date: 2014-01-12 15:48:28
Good answer. Short and to the point. But a little more explanation could be handy.
"Best practice" (sorry, but it's really the best phrase to use here) in personal finance is to keep a reasonable amount of cash on hand for emergencies. Recommendations vary from three months of expenses up to a year; I tend to split the difference and say that as long as you have steady and dependable income, keeping six months of normal expenses in cash is a good way to go.
The idea behind this is to keep these funds *purely liquid.* That is, you can spend them on demand for anything you might need money for. A pipe bursts in your house and you need a plumber to fix it? No problem; just write a check against your cash account. Easy. No delays, no fuss.
If you wanted to, you could keep your rainy-day fund in a secure but illiquid form instead. Certificates of deposit or bonds, say. Doing that would protect your principle against inflation; that is, as inflation diminishes the value of cash holdings by about 2% per year, your rainy-day fund will accrue value at the same or a better rate, preserving the pure value by increasing the denominated value. Great plan … except it totally defeats the purpose of keeping a rainy-day fund in the first place. Even if you choose a form for your cash holdings that can be relatively easily converted to cash, like bonds, you're still looking at delays on the order of days between needing your money and having your money. The idea behind a rainy-day fund *in cash* is that you have access to the money literally whenever you need it, on demand, with no delays. That's what the fund is for.
Keeping such a fund in bit coins would be totally stupid for two major reasons. First, you'd be choosing a highly illiquid store of value. Unlike a CD you can sell a bit coin, but unlike a bond you can't do so on a high-volume, established market. It's *hard* to sell bit coins, and it takes an unreasonable amount of time. That's the opposite of what you want for a rainy-day cash account.
The other factor to consider is that bit coins *lose value.* You should never store your cash holdings in any form that can lose value. US Treasury bonds cannot lose value; neither can certificates of deposit. Those are worth precisely what they say they're worth forever and ever amen, as long as the law exists to back them. you can never *lose money* storing your cash holdings in such forms as those, just as you can't lose money storing your cash as cash. (You can lose *value* to inflation, but the rate is so incredibly low that it's not worth thinking about compared to the security of keeping your funds in a guaranteed form.)
Bit coins, though? Hell, those little bastards lose significant fractions of their value every time somebody sneezes. If you believe that bit coins will hold their value over the long term, then you can choose to hold them for the long term, using your time in market commitment to ride out volatility. But that strategy trades flexibility for security. Again, the purpose of a rainy-day fund is to have *unrestricted access* to your money whenever you need it. If you store that fund in a form that loses value, you can easily find yourself in a position where you need to convert to cash *now,* and the only way to do that is by taking a significant loss. That's a bad money-management strategy.
So the answer given in the link is absolutely right on: No, one should definitely not do that. But the reasons why are worth reflecting on when the time comes to consider what one *should* do instead.

Bit coins cannot be created. They must come from somewhere. This bit coin bank you're imagining could not lend out *any* bit coins unless it withdrew them from the accounts of its depositors. At that point if a borrower defaults on his loan, the depositors themselves are out by however many bit coins the borrower failed to repay.
Bit coins are not money. You can create money out of nothing, backed by debt. You cannot create bit coins.

You're missing the fundamental point of a unit of account. The point is that people use it as a common frame of reference to denominate things. How many people are using bit coins to denominate anything? Exactly zero.
Bit coins are in a deflationary period, as they always will be. Inflation and deflation are not determined by whether the supply is growing or shrinking. They're determined by the relationship between the time rate of change of the supply and the time rate of change of the demand. Just observe what the market price of bit coins is doing if you want to skip over the math and see the result.

The problem you're going to run into is that you're just plain wrong. It's fundamentally *not* a good idea to "invest" in bit coins.
The first priority of any investment is the preservation of principal. The objective, before any other, is to *keep what you have.* If an investment can accrue value over time, great; it makes sense to accept some time-based risk to buy the chance for gains. But bit coins don't offer time-based risk. They're lottery tickets.
If you want your parents to invest into some financial instrument for you, say with the goal of giving you a down-payment on a house in ten years or so, you're far better off looking at zero-risk instruments like I-series bonds, or low-risk instruments like mutual funds. Because whatever happens with those, your principal is safe. That's what investing is. Don't confuse it with gambling.

In other words, bit coins have no inherent utility, and are useful only as a medium of exchange. As I said elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-01-16 22:14:27
That didn't even begin to answer my question.
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:12:01
Bit coins *only* have value because other people believe they do. There's nothing intrinsic to fall back on to give them what's called a *value floor.* A loaf of bread has a value floor because if all else fails, you can eat it. You can't eat bit coins, which means there's nothing stopping the value of a bit coin from falling all the way to zero. That is, it's possible that you might end up with a bit coin you can't sell at *any price.*
That's a big risk.
In general, the first rule of investing is to preserve your principal. You put this-much money into an investment secure in the knowledge that you'll get that much back out of it again in the future. If you buy shares of a company for a certain price, the idea is that you can turn around and sell those shares for the *same price* in the future, thus recouping your investment. You know that there's a chance you might not make your investment back — the price of the stock could fall — but you can have confidence that it won't fall *too much.* Because a share of a company represents real intrinsic value: real estate, capital equipment, employees and all that stuff which has actual meaningful value behind it. If worse came to worst, the company could liquidate all its assets, so it has a meaningful value floor. You know how much you stand to lose when you buy the shares.
Since bit coins have no value floor, you stand to lose *everything* you sink into them. You could get your money back out, or it's possible you could get *nothing* back out.
Some will say that this means bit coins are just a high-risk investment. Except that's not true. The risk associated with investing in bit coins isn't high; it's *total.* You risk not a fraction of your principal, but *all of it.* You could *lose everything,* because there's no fundamental economic principle propping up the value of a bit coin.
All that goes to say no, you should not invest in bit coins. You're better off "investing" at a casino. The odds are closer to even that you'll take home a profit, and the risk is no greater.

The "good news" you're imagining was already priced in. The current trading price of the security is already based on the assumption that those things are happening, and will continue to happen indefinitely. The price won't go up when those things happen, because those things happening is business-as-usual for the security. In order for the price to respond to a piece of news, it has to be *unanticipated* news … at least unanticipated by buyers and sellers.

There's a lot of toxic misinformation buried in your comment, I'm afraid. From the top…


It always does to the individual who doesn't understand the macroeconomics of the thing. But the fact is that deflationary economies *always necessarily* grind to a halt. They just do, because there's a hard pressure pushing velocity to zero. It's catastrophic, economically.


It doesn't. The capital market holds exactly as many dollars (or whatever) as it holds.


That's not really a thing we can agree or disagree on. It's just an empirical fact. Look at the size and volatility of the market. It's extremely difficult to convert bit coins into money.


That's not an investment. That's a gamble. Investing preserves your principal.

@_date: 2014-01-07 18:19:00
"People who fret about deflationary currency" aren't talking about spending (or currency, for that matter). We're talking about the effect of deflation on the circulation of capital. Spending is not significant economic activity; it's important not to be distracted by it when talking about macroeconomics.
And saying that deflation challenges assumptions is remarkably short-sighted. *Within your lifetime,* assuming you're not a child yourself, the United States has been plagued by the consequences of deflation, which is precisely why we finally got away from commodity money entirely. It's not like deflation is an experiment that's never been tried. It's a *failure* that we know never to repeat.
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:51:55
That's only true if the market price is climbing. If it's staying flat or falling, then your buying shares doesn't increase the value of anybody else's shares. In fact, it can diminish the value of everybody else's shares if you contribute to an unnaturally high price that leads to a crash. See Beanie Babies.

No, you can't. Didn't you read that paper that came out a few weeks ago? The market price of bit coins is not correlated to *anything.* It's essentially random. You can't predict what it's going to do, and because it has no value floor, you can't be assured that it won't fall indefinitely.

You'd break the game. The premise of Monopoly is that there is a limitless money source called the Bank. That can't exist with bit coins. The mechanic of making it around the board to receive newly created money from the Bank would no longer exist, which would make every turn of the game zero-sum.

Doesn't matter. Deflation happens when the time rate of change of supply fails to keep up with the time rate of change of demand.


That's not correct. I'm not sure what else to say about it, except that it's simply not a correct statement. I don't know where your misunderstanding is coming from, so I don't know how to correct it.


No, all that does is change the rate at which new bit coins are created. It doesn't have anything to do with making sure supply growth keeps up with demand growth.


That's not really a bank any more, then, is it? A bank is an institution in which you can store money such that *you are guaranteed to be able to get it back out.* What you're describing is more like a hostage situation than a bank.

That wouldn't accomplish the goal. The goal is to keep capital moving by keeping the price of money relatively low. By buying bonds that previously stored lending reserves, the central bank increases the liquidity of lending reserves, therefore lowering the price of money. This is good, because it means capital is available for, for instance, new starts and expansions. Sending everybody a check wouldn't accomplish anything like that.

No, it's a bit coin problem. The "legacy banking system" permits instantaneous and safe transactions for *literally every other good and service in existence.* But bit coins are, by comparison, nearly impossible to buy. I can buy a *car* more quickly and easily than I can buy a bit coin.




There's nothing transparent about the bit coin network. It's "transparent" in that there are no walls behind which secrets are kept, but the system is so bafflingly complex that you have to have a computer science degree just to start to understand it.


But bit coin transactions are designed from the ground up to be irrevocable. That's just face-slappingly stupid. The virtue of the modern system of banking is that every transaction can be trivially reversed if and when the need arises. Everybody's equally protected and the cost is minimal.


Nobody's claiming it's hard to understand. Coiners are claiming that it's not a problem, which is completely wrong.


You're just mistaken. It's a transparent attempt to stir up the mentality of the dot-com bubble … which, you may or may not be aware, *burst.*

It's not a sign of speculation. Remember, the velocity is greater than one.

If bit coins are *only* a medium of exchange, then why do coiners care about the market price?
Bit coins are trying to be two things: a store of value and a medium of exchange. Unfortunately they're designed such that they can't be both of those things effectively. Because the supply of bit coins is finite, the better they are at storing value, the worse they are at being a medium of exchange and vice versa.

Well, think about it rationally for a minute. What do bit coins let you do that you *cannot do right now?* Um … nothing. Literally, nothing.
Okay, so what do bit coins make *significantly easier or cheaper* compared to existing methods? Um … also nothing. I know, people love to talk about remittances and sending money over the Internet with a click, but the fact is we can already do those things (see above), and bit coins' complexity and obscurity outweighs any ease it might bring to the party.
So how are these businesses going to strike rich veins of new revenue by jumping through the monstrous hoops bit coins require? Bit coins don't enable anything wholly new, nor do they make anything significantly cheaper or easier. So … what's the business case?
If you can answer that question, then bit coins might end up going somewhere. But if you, like I, can't, then it's right to be extremely skeptical.

But they're not divisible to infinity. They're divisible to eight decimal places. If somebody decided to change the bit coin system to make them divisible to *nine* decimal places that would increase by a factor of ten the total number of minimum units available, but the fact remains that the total number of minimum units would remain finite.
Calling bit coins "infinitely divisible" is just a lie. Computers don't do infinite anything.

That's all well and good, but you're *still* not seeing that "saving" bit coins is not saving in the macroeconomic sense of the word. "Saving" bit coins is *hoarding,* which deprives the market of useful capital. It's bad for the economy overall.
If we were talking about dollars, you'd be absolutely right. Because a dollar saved is one stored on account at a bank where it capitalizes lending and thus economic growth. But we aren't talking about that. We're talking about bit coins — nominally "value," but let's not get into whether bit coins have real value — simply *disappearing.* That's bad for the economy. If everybody did it, they wouldn't have options at all, because their income would dry up as the economy ground to a halt.

The best thing for bit coins would be for the price to crash. Bit coins are a transaction token, right? The idea is that you convert money into bit coins, then move those bit coins around, then convert them right back into money again. For that to be frictionless, as the coiners like to say, the value of bit coins needs to be pegged to the local monetary unit. One dollar equals one bit coin. If the value of a bit coin fluctuates (for totally random market-based reasons, not for any real reason) then you introduce an element of risk into the process. What if your bit coins are worth less when you get them out of the system than they were worth when you put them in? Then you lose money, unavoidably, and without actually doing anything on your part to justify the loss. The risk becomes part of the cost of doing business with bit coins, and that cost is quite high already.

Wrong. Inflation happens when the supply of money grows *faster than the demand for money.* Deflation is the opposite: It's when the demand grows faster than the supply. Simply saying that bit coins are being created doesn't make the bit coin economy inflationary. What would make it inflationary is if the *time rate of growth of supply* exceeded the time rate of growth of demand. This is not the case, as you can tell by the market price of bit coins.
@_date: 2014-01-11 15:52:44

The supposedly very inexpensive per-transaction bounties that have to be paid into the system will have to skyrocket to cover the cost of keeping the system up and running. Since there is no central transaction processing authority, there is no means by which to regulate the health of the network, so basically the whole thing will turn into customer extortion. You want your transaction to go through? Better attach an extra buck or two to sweeten the pot and hope it's enough. Otherwise, forget it. Your transaction will get lost in the ether.

That's a big part of the problem. If you can reasonably expect to make 10% year over year — a number I just pulled out of the air for conversation — just by sitting in cash, then obviously you need to earn a lot more than that to invest. Not just a little more, but a *lot* more, for risk management reasons. You're looking at a market where capital investors are literally demanding 20% or higher year-over-year returns, which is completely unsustainable. That's why deflation staunches the flow of capital. And since the flow of capital is the whole reason we have an economy in the first place, even a little deflation always qualifies as a crisis.

The biggest threat to bit coins is the lack of a value proposition. Nobody can effectively answer the question "Why would I want this?" The "best" answers (using that term loosely) revolve around fractions-of-a-percent differences in fees that consumers never see anyway and edge-cases like immigrants sending money home to family in other countries. These simply don't add up to a good reason why anyone should bother.
So we have a "currency" (ugh) that at present exists *solely* to be a speculative security. Nobody's buying bit coins to use them, because nobody has a use for them. People are buying them in hopes of getting rich quick off them. As soon as it becomes clear that that's not possible, the air's going to go right out of the bit coin balloon and a bunch of people will be left holding "coins" they have absolutely no use for and never wanted in the first place.

You're still not seeing the point. The point is that the rate of change of supply cannot keep up with the rate of change of demand (assuming it remains positive, which is not a given but is a requirement for continued bit coin existence). Ergo, deflationary economics apply.
@_date: 2014-01-13 14:58:54


Actually we don't. That's part of the problem. See, a lot of people think the creation of new money necessarily means inflation. This is not how it works. What causes inflation is when the supply of money grows *significantly faster* than the demand for money. We've been pumping $85 billion in new money per month into the economy for years, but the rate of inflation is *still* too low, because the growth in supply isn't keeping up with the growth in demand.

New money is created every time a loan is extended. You can easily acquire money without somebody else having to lose money, by backing it with your debt.

"Many places?" Since the discriminatory pricing practices you describe are expressly against EFTPOS agreements, it's fair to say you're not talking about "many places."
Besides, you're missing the point. Bitcoin services just *aren't as good* as EFTPOS. If you were talking about a transaction processing service that was *better* than EFTPOS, we'd have a reasonable conversation about whether it can survive with slow transaction approvals and no fraud protection. But we aren't. We're talking about something which is positioned to compete with EFTPOS but which *isn't even as good,* much less better. It competes only on price, and there's simply no room to compete on price. It's a non-starter.

It would be, yes, if people were actually saying that. That's not what's being said, though. What's being said is more akin to "Okay, we get the gist, and here's where all the problems are."
For instance, the criticisms that *keep being raised* about bit coins are the difficulty of buying them and selling them, the sheer complexity of the system that creates them, the lack of any accountability or protection, and the deflationary nature of the security. Those aren't "we don't understand it" criticisms. They're pretty solidly in the realm of "Yes, we see what you're doing here, and here's why you're not succeeding."

Let me explain what I mean by that.
We often think of cash as the simplest means of moving money around. After all, you just *give it* to somebody, right? Take it out of your pocket, put it in the other guy's hand, and the transaction is done.
But in truth, cash isn't as simple as that description makes it sound. First and most obviously, cash is *denominated.* Each unit of currency we use comes in some denomination. If I want to get you $20, then I can just give you a $20 banknote … or two $10 notes, or a $10 and two $5 notes, or whatever. But if I want to give you $19, life just got harder. I could assemble just the right combination of notes to give you $19, or I could give you a $20 note and ask you for a $1 note back, but you might only have a $5 note on you, which means I need to give you $24 if I want you to give me that $5 back … and so on. It's not an insurmountable problem by any means, but it's a thing. A think people have to pay attention to and deal with.
So the first way we could make cash transactions better is by making them *arbitrary.* Instead of using denominated banknotes, what if we could just dial in any arbitrary amount of money and exchange it the way we exchange cash?
Well, you might say (and quite rightly too) this is what a check is. It's a blank piece of paper that can be filled out in any amount and exchanged like cash. That's absolutely right. But checks, despite being more flexible than cash, aren't perfect either. See, there's at least one middle-man involved in conducting a transaction with a check: the payer's *bank,* which is responsible for honoring the check and exchanging it for money on demand. This isn't a problem in and of itself (though it does add an extra step before the transaction can be closed), but it does create a problem of communication: A check can be written for a sum greater than the available funds on account at the payer's bank. This can happen by accident or it can be done out of malice, but the result is the same either way: The payee ends up with a piece of paper that isn't worth any money. At *best,* that's tremendously inconvenient. So to protect himself, the payee has to take the time to record certain identifying information about the payer, first to just do a quick sanity check to make sure there's a reason to believe the payer has the right to write that check at all, and second to give the payee somebody to go after if the check turns out to be worthless.
Well, we can streamline that process considerably, and in fact we did starting about thirty years ago. See, there's no reason, in principle, why the payee can't *contact the bank immediately* when the check is issued and make sure the funds named on the check are available on account. Of course, doing this with a phone call wouldn't be terribly convenient, because there are sure to be more payees trying to confirm the validity of checks than there are people at the bank to pick up the phone. But what if we mediated the confirmation process electronically, using machines connected by telephones instead? An automated confirmation process could verify that a check is good in seconds, while both the payer and the payee wait on it.
That's what EFTPOS is. The system goes by a few different marketing names, most commonly "check cards" or "debit cards," but the idea is that an *arbitrary* amount of money can be transferred from one person to another via a bank with an automatic confirmation step that makes sure the funds are actually available on account before the transaction is closed. The system's fast, easy and very inexpensive; it works so well, in fact, that it's *by far* the most common way people exchange money today.
But under the hood, the system has gotten rather complex. We started with a guy taking banknotes out of his pocket and evolved it — for the better, to be sure — into a system where *four parties* all have to interact in real time to make the transaction happen: the payer, the payee, the payer's bank, and the transaction processing system that validates the whole thing. If any one of those four parties isn't available, isn't looped in on the conversation, the transaction can't take place. Is there any way we can improve on that?
That's where bit coins come in … *in principle.* In principle, bit coins let you accomplish the same basic kind of transaction — moving an arbitrary amount of money from one party to another — with only two participants. (Except it's really many more than two participants; more on this in a second.)
The idea behind bit coins is that you put "money" (the quotes are there for a reason; read on) into a thing called a "wallet," which is an electronic storage mechanism that plays the same role as the payer's bank account did in the check or EFTPOS versions of this story. To conduct a transaction, you specify any arbitrary amount of that "money," up to the amount in the "wallet," and order that it be transferred into another "wallet." The other "wallet" is identified by a (nominally) unique address belonging to the payee. Behind the scenes, your "wallet" talks to the payee's "wallet" and the "money" gets moved between them.
That's *the idea.* That's the principle of the thing. And at that level, it's really quite a good idea … in principle. It's a further streamlining of the work we've been doing for decades to make transactions simpler and faster.
Of course, in *practice* bit coins are really rather terrible. Bit coins don't work with money; that's why I had to put the word in quotes up above. They work only with these special virtual objects, the "bit coins" themselves, which are *kind of* like money but which aren't. Any time you want to spend money via a bit coin transaction, your first step has to be converting some of your money into bit coins, sort of like buying tickets at the county fair. And inevitably, just like tickets at the county fair, you end up *not* having just the right amount for whatever your needs are, meaning you either bought too few bit coins or you bought slightly too many and have some left over. Then there's the fact that the electronic "wallet" duplicates the functionality of your bank account; before you can conduct a bit coins transaction, you must move money out of your bank account and put it, now in bit coin form, into a "wallet" that you have to keep track of.
Then there's the behind-the-scenes problem of transaction speed. The great virtue of EFTPOS, as described above, is that it's a real-time system. It takes only seconds for a payee — once they're set up as an EFTPOS merchant, obviously! — to contact the payer's bank via the EFTPOS network and get confirmation that the funds promised actually exist. The transaction happens so fast we can wait on it when making a retail purchase; it takes no more time for the transaction to go through than it takes to count out change for banknotes. That's what makes EFTPOS so great.
Bit coins, on the other hand, are *really* slow. It takes ten minutes for a bit coins transaction to go through. That's far too long for a payee and payer to wait around on it, so we have to *reintroduce* the idea of trust that we specifically developed EFTPOS to get away from.
So to sum it all up, what's the real value of bit coins? They're *in theory* a marginal improvement on the payment systems we already have. Because transactions are confirmed, the need for trust (and the potential to break that trust) that checks pose is no longer there, and because they work over a federated network they're available in principle to anybody, not just to companies that have contracted with EFTPOS transaction processing services. So *in principle* they should be as easy to use as an EFTPOS transaction but available to everyone, even individuals.
But we have to be honest about the ways in which bit coins fail to live up to that promise. The duplication of bank-account functionality is a massive inconvenience, and the need to buy bit coins the way you'd buy fairground tickets is frankly quite backwards. The fact that bit coins operate in a decentralized way appeals to people of a particular fringe political bent, but in practice it means the system is far too impractically slow to compete with EFTPOS.
So really, the *practical* value of bit coins is that they provide a hint of how a next-generation transaction processing infrastructure *could* work, if it were built correctly from the ground up. As it is, bit coins are not that system; for individual payee-payer transactions, we are better off continuing to use cash and personal checks, and for retail transactions EFTPOS still rules the roost. But maybe it might be possible for some institution to learn from the *massive* mistakes of bit coins and come up with an alternative to cash, checks and EFTPOS that actually works. That's the value of bit coins.

Nobody would say gold because gold hasn't backed money anywhere for years. What backs money is the law. The law says money is negotiable as payment for all debts. If you offer something for sale and somebody offers you money, you must take it. That's the law.
In more macroeconomic terms, what backs money is an equal value of debt. But coiners tend to fail to understand that because they don't understand debt. They think it means credit cards and compounding interest.

Not really. The Federal Reserve has been very open with its intentions specifically to quell feelings of uncertainty with regard to monetary policy. That's a big part of what the Fed is good for: Telling everybody what's going on, what's being paid attention to, and what's likely to happen in the future. It rules out speculation on the subject of monetary policy.
It would in fact be *awful* if large-scale matters of monetary policy were left to pure laissez faire. Then you really *would* be introducing uncertainty, and not just inviting but *demanding* speculation.

A footnote: "the 5 billion 'unbanked'" is the result of a misinterpretation of the statistics. The actual number of people who don't have regular access to banking services is roughly two billion *adults,* somewhat less than half of the adult population. We don't count children. Most people who are eligible for banking services take advantage of banking services.
That said, all your examples assume that these people have a steady source of money to convert into bit coins and stuff under their mattresses. You're ignoring the larger-scale economic effects of a contracting capital market. Put simply, if everybody did what you're suggesting, nobody would have a steady source of money, because employment would shrink as the business sector is unable to grow.
Economics is not about what a person does with his money. That's personal finance. Economics is about the larger-scale phenomena associated with many millions of people all doing things. You can't focus on one and ignore the other.

Computer computer computer. The short version is something we all know to be true already: On average it takes ten minutes for a bit coin transaction to be confirmed.

The problem with bit coins is that there's *nothing* behind the price. A scholarly paper on this was published a week or two ago; hated it.

It wouldn't help. This keeps coming up, and the answer's always the same: If you want to convince a business to adopt a new transaction processing system, you *must make a valid business case.* It will cost you this much to do it, and it will earn you this much in new revenues. The reason why it's so hard to come up with a valid business case for bit coins is because it's basically impossible to demonstrate lost revenue due to not processing bit coin transactions. Anybody who wants to do business with you already has access to money, so they will simply pay you money. If they've *only* got bit coins (first of all, they're idiots), they will simply sell their bit coins for money before buying your goods or services. So basically it benefits merchants *not at all* to go to the extra cost and trouble of doing bit coin transactions.

Well, you're partly right. IRA and 401(k) are both types of accounts, not stores of value themselves. The assets in IRA and 401(k) accounts are securities: primarily stocks and bonds.
Open-market securities are quite liquid, and are able to be converted into cash at market prices within fifteen minutes. They are obviously not as liquid as cash, but they aren't supposed to be.
People do not store their reserves in gold or silver, no. Those are commodities that are highly *illiquid,* and are difficult or impossible to convert to cash at market prices in a timely fashion.
The common denominator here is that people store their reserves — their savings, if you want to think of it that way — in ways that trade liquidity for return. That's a good thing because it moves money out of cash reserves and into the capital open market, which is good for the economy.
People would not be inclined to store their reserves in bit coins, first of all because they're illiquid and volatile, and second because they don't move reserves into the capital market and thus would be a net drain on the economy.
The short version of all that jargon is that capital-market investment is superior to reliance on deflation.

Just as there's no blanket cure for infection, there can be no blanket cure for cancer, because cancer's not a single disease.

As for your step two, those "megasales" were actually kilosales. The company cleared about $100,000 in bit coin transactions on their first day, when transactions peaked. That's a long way from mega-anything.
Your step three is completely unfounded. Why would people want to be paid in anything other than money? Money is how we pay our bills, it's how we pay our taxes, it's how we pay our rent or mortgage. Those things aren't going to change. Given the absurd price volatility of bit coins and the onerous difficulty of acquiring and exchanging them, only the most short-sighted coiners (read: "all coiners," probably) would think it makes sense to be paid in bit coins. Why not just demand to be paid in rice instead? At least you can eat rice. Oh, right. It's because we prefer to be able to choose whether we buy rice with our earnings or beans or candy or whatever else we might want. We prefer money because it's *universal,* not some hard-to-use, hard-to-exchange scrip.

You completely misunderstand what I'm saying. You said bit coins are a good medium of exchange. I agree with you … up to a point. Bit coins *would be* a good medium of exchange if everybody had them and everybody wanted them. That's what makes a medium of exchange good: ubiquity. The fact that hardly anybody has bit coins is a problem, but it's not *the* problem. *The* problem is that it's so incredibly difficult to get bit coins. They can't be created, see; they must come from somebody. They're a zero-sum economic system, born and bred. And if you go to the trouble of acquiring some bit coins, what are you going to do with them? "Spend" them? How? Nobody wants them. Why does nobody want them? Because they're so difficult to convert to money.
What makes money a good medium of exchange is that everybody has it and everybody wants it. Bit coins don't have those properties. And it's not a function of adoption; bit coins are *designed* in such a way that they don't have those properties.

Given past explorations of this question on you're probably going to get answers that focus on *spending,* as in people selling their bit coins for dollars (or whatever) to purchase goods and services.
This misses the point completely. Let's talk about why.
Forget for a moment that any kind of money exists but dollars. You have a substantial hoard of dollars that you've accumulated through work and careful budgeting. Just to put a number on it, let's say it's $100,000. This is more money than you need for the foreseeable future. Your ongoing expenses are covered by your regular cash flow, and you don't plan to make any big purchases, so that $100,000 is just going to sit there.
What do you do with it?
Well, obviously you want to *store it* in some safe way. The primary objective of safely storing your money is to make sure you don't lose any of it. If you convert your $100,000 into banknotes and stuff them under your mattress, your house might burn down taking your hoard of money with it. That'd be a bad way to store your money, because it doesn't guarantee that you can get it back.
So what do you do instead? You deposit it in a *bank.* Banks are safe institutions for storing that much money. The bank is guaranteed to remain solvent, meaning you can get some or all of your money out whenever you want, and if the bank *doesn't* remain solvent, the FDIC will step in and make sure your deposit is protected. So job one is now done: You've stored your money in a safe way. Every one of your $100,000 will remain available to you indefinitely.
But here's the thing: If that $100,000 just sits in an account at a bank, it's not doing anything useful for anybody. It is, effectively, removed from circulation. That's why we allow banks to create new money based on the size of their deposits: This process keeps money circulating and allows useful economic work to happen.
But imagine that banks *couldn't* create money that way. (Because we're really talking not about dollars but about bit coins, which absolutely cannot be created at all.) Then sticking your money in a bank would be no different *economically* from stuffing it under your mattress. It'd remove that money from circulation, which would make money (slightly) more scarce and thus hurt the economy overall. And if *everybody* who had money they weren't using did the same thing — whether it be storing it under a mattress or in a bank account where it can't be used to capitalize loans — then money would become *significantly* more scarce, and the economy would suffer a *lot.*
We solve this problem with dollars by introducing *inflation.* See, the number of dollars in the world is not fixed, nor is it controlled by any central authority. Instead, it increases as new dollars are created through lending. As the supply of dollars grows *faster* than the demand for dollars — by a margin of between two and five percent in a healthy economy — each individual dollar ends up being worth less over time. So while your life savings of $100,000 will remain exactly $100,000 for as long as you care to wait — because you've stored it in a safe way, in an insured bank — after a year that $100,000 will only be worth the equivalent of $98,000 today. You'll have preserved your principal, but you'll have lost *value.*
So what does the smart money-hoarder do? He *sells his money on the capital market,* by investing it in the stock market or in bonds or in any combination of secure interest-earning investments. The goal there is to earn a return on your investment equal to the rate of inflation, so $100,000 today has the same equivalent value a year from now, or ten years from now, or thirty years from now, or whatever.
See, the upshot of all that is that our economy is designed such that the *selfish hoarder of money* will want to *sell his money* to beat inflation, thus keeping that money circulating and doing useful economic work.
Except that can't happen with bit coins. See, bit coins are *deflationary.* Whereas the supply of dollars grows faster than the demand for dollars, the supply of bit coins grows more slowly than demand for bit coins (in a hypothetical scenario in which there is widespread demand for bit coins). That means that the equivalent value of a single bit coin *grows* over time rather than shrinking. So the selfish hoarder of bit coins will be incentivized to do the exact opposite of what the selfish hoarder of money will do: The selfish hoarder of bit coins will just sit on them. He won't even put them in a bank — "Be your own bank" the coiners say, seemingly ignorant of the important economic role banks play — but rather do the electronic equivalent of stuffing them under his mattress.
That's why a bit coin economy *can't have a capital market at all.* Because no rational actor would ever sell their bit coins as capital. The price they'd demand for doing so would have to beat the returns they earn through deflation, which prices capital right out of the market. That's why deflation in general creates a capital market crisis, and a monetary system that's built around deflation can't work. There's just no capital available anywhere.
So the short answer to your question is that not only does nothing about a bit coin stop wealthy coiners from sitting on their money, the economic properties of bit coins *strongly encourage them to do just that.* Which affects the distribution of bit coins if you happen to care about such things, but far more importantly it essentially shuts down the bit coin economy entirely, since there's no capital circulating.

But you have to spend pennies on a single dollar, too. Transaction bounties are the only way you'll get your transaction through the system *at all.*


That's kind of the point, though. It really *doesn't* have a long way to go because the problems we're talking about are systemic. They're built right into how bit coins are supposed to work. Because the person who designed them was a computer nerd, not an economist. Bit coins represent an amusing solution to an obscure problem in game theory, not a viable real-world transaction system.

It's not that we've evolved to a place where our economy couldn't exist without a capital market. It's that *not* having a capital market is objectively bad. A capital market is necessary for useful economic work. Without it, useful economic work can't be done.
And for the record, *nobody* is "in control" of the money supply. The money supply grows every time a loan is created. We have a central bank that *influences* the money supply through interest rates and open-market operations, but nobody outright controls it.

Normative philosophy doesn't really have a place here. Bit coins are a proposed method of payment; that's all. They have no moral value. *Should* they succeed? If and only if they're competitive to existing payment methods. We can all agree, I think, that they are not; coiners like to hand-wave this away by saying "But they could be." That's all fine and good, but the fact remains that bit coins are not currently competitive. Therefore no, they should not succeed in the free market.

Just so you know, in most jurisdictions this is unlawful, and it's always in violation of merchant agreements. Some jurisdictions have loopholes that prohibit surcharging but allow arbitrary discounts, so merchants sometimes try to pitch it as offering a discount for cash rather than adding a surcharge to credit transactions, but this is very tricky to pull off legally because it gets into how the prices are listed and how the discount is offered.

They're like tickets you buy at the county fair. You go in, hand over some real money in exchange for "county fair" money, then spend the county fair money on rides and snacks. When you're done making yourself sick, you go out to the parking lot and try to find somebody who'll take your leftover tickets off your hands for a fraction of what you paid for them.

Bitpay can't handle a *small* volume of transactions. They average what, a few hundred transactions a *day?* Not an hour, but per *day.* That doesn't even qualify as a small transaction volume. It qualifies as effectively no transactions at all.

It couldn't work the same way.
Here's how lending works. You've got $100 in currency, and I'm a bank. You come to me and ask to open an account. I take your $100 and stick it in a shoebox, and give you back an account with a balance of $100.
Along comes another guy, call him Bob. Bob wants to be a baker. Tom has an oven to sell for $50, but Bob doesn't have that much money. So Bob wants to take out a loan from me. I look over his business plan and agree that it sounds good, so I give him the $50 loan. Bob takes the lent money and gives it to Tom, who deposits it in his account at my bank.
If you look at my balance sheet after all that, you see that I have $150 in liabilities — $100 to you and $50 to Tom — and $150 in assets — the $100 in cash on hand I have, plus a loan to Bob worth $50. We started out with just $100 in existence and ended up with $150 in existence; the new $50 was created with the backing of Bob's debt to the bank.
Since you can't create new bit coins, you can't lend bit coins.

Don't think of them as currency conversion rates; they're not. Think of them as most recent selling prices. Bit coins aren't money; they're tokens you can buy and sell for money. What you're thinking of as a "conversion rate" is just the most recent selling price. It doesn't tell you what your bit coins are worth; it just gives you a *vague idea* of what you *might* be able to sell them for if you tried.

If I'm parsing that into English correctly … no. You're mistaken. That's not what a speculative bubble is. A speculative bubble is a market situation in which the price of something rises beyond the level that the market will bear, causing the bubble to "pop." Which is why they're called speculative bubbles.
The stock market is not in any way, shape or form a speculative bubble. The market price of each issue in the market is based on the *real-world value* of the company that issued it. Each of those companies could, if worse came to worst, be liquidated and all their assets converted into cash which could be distributed to the shareholders. Not that that would happen, but that's what provides the fundamental basis for the price of an issue.

CDs are specifically for people who *do* know they won't be using the funds early. That's why those types of accounts exist. Anybody who doesn't have that knowledge can keep their funds in a regular savings account, or even a demand-deposit account which has no limits on access.

Nope. Security is useful only so long as it saves money. If it costs more money than it saves (because transactions take longer), then it's a waste.
Coiners should be on board with this. After all, they're the ones who keep saying it's okay for merchants to accept zero-confirmation transactions to save the ten minutes it would normally take for a bit coin purchase to clear.

The truth is nobody knows. It's never been tried. It's *assumed* by many that the people who use the bit coin transaction processing system will volunteer to pay for the infrastructure required to keep it going by offering up small bounties on each and every one of their transactions. If you want to buy a cup of coffee for one bit coin, you'll offer a tenth of a bit coin "tip" to make sure your transaction gets validated by the network. That's the theory.
But in practice, nobody knows what will happen. Will these voluntary bounties be enough to cover the cost of electricity to keep the vast mining computer farms running? It seems implausible at best. Right now the gnomes are happy to sink huge operating costs into mining for the promise of substantial rewards for "digging up" new bit coins, but once the rate of bit coin production falls far enough, that promise won't be enough. It's entirely possible that the air will go out of the whole system, and the gnomes will need to scramble to find a new way to support themselves. Since the bit coin system is based on the premise of being able to undercut the 3% surcharge on credit card and EFTPOS transactions, there's not a lot of headroom for profit to be taken on transaction processing. There's a valid reason to be concerned.

Um. People *do* say the same of those things. Well, sometimes, anyway. Real estate is famously stable, and many stock issues are better long-term investments than others are. But all you basically said there is "things which are bad stores of value are bad stores of value." Which is kind of a big duh.


Except that's not even a little bit supported by any facts. The number of people who hold bit coins is irrelevant; even the number of people trading them doesn't matter very much. What matters is whether there are any economic forces that encourage stability of the market price. And bit coins were designed from the ground up *not* to have any of those market forces. There's no reason to think the market would ever stabilize, no matter what. Bitcoins are built to be unstable.

Please stop downvoting my comments. It's not warranted.
You said that "more and more people are starting to use them." What's the adoption rate, and is it proportional? And please don't talk about merchant acceptance; that's not the question. The question is whether people are *actually using bitcoins to pay for things.* Think actual payers here, not potential payees.
The number, you will doubtless find, is far smaller than would be justified by all the "it's just inherently better" talk. If it were inherently better, it would be widely used. It's not widely used, so *something* is preventing people from using it. Consider that when constructing your value proposition. Because it means any value prop based on "it's just better" is *at best* missing a big piece of the picture.

In layman's terms? Mining is aptly named, because it's the process of extracting bitcoins and making them available to be sold for money. Just as gold must be mined out of the ground before it can be minted into coins and sold, bitcoins must be mined before they can be sold.
The difference is that bitcoin mining is *carefully* controlled. The rate at which bitcoins are mined up is controlled by the central issuing authority, and the total number of bitcoins available to be mined is similarly controlled by the same authority.

It's literally impossible to buy bit coins with gold, so "pricing" it that way would make no sense. You'd just be taking the price of a unit weight of gold in dollars and comparing it to the asking price for a bit coin in dollars.
The larger point here is that gold and silver are not money. *Literally no one on earth* uses money backed by gold or silver any more, because that kind of money doesn't work. You don't want to make bit coins look even more like a throwback to the 18th century.

This is where the deflationary pressure really becomes a problem. Because bit coins are built to be deflationary, potential sources of capital are constrained. If your holdings are projected to gain 8% year-over-year just by sitting there, then you have to charge *more* than 8% on any loans you extend in order to beat that. Otherwise you're losing money. Because of this, credit in a bit coin economy would be permanently and severely constrained.
Fortunately, I don't think anybody imagines a bit coin economy. The question right now is whether bit coin can survive as a competitor to Paypal and Western Union, not whether it can be a sound economy on its own.

I predict this will go nowhere. Financial instruments of all kinds are subject to forfeiture, including securities. Bitcoins are unbacked securities, so they're subject to forfeiture.

I predict the motion will be summarily dismissed.

No, they're *buying* about $70 billion worth a month. Slightly more, in fact. See how this works? Open-market operations controls the money supply by adding more money to the capital market (by buying securities from lending institutions to supplement lending capital) or by removing money from the capital market (by selling securities to lending institutions to replace lending capital).

"Your sub-1%-fee system" doesn't actually exist. Everybody keeps talking about it like it does, but when pressed they'll admit they're daydreaming about something which *maybe could* happen someday, possibly.

I make no guess at what his claim was or wasn't. But the *fact* is that bit coin transaction volume is miniscule. Not just before Christmas, not just after Christmas, not just on Christmas, but even at their all-time high forever and ever, they're still tiny. People just aren't using bit coins for anything, on average. On average, the whole system rounds down to zero. You might not like that fact and might hope it'll change someday, but it's true.

@_date: 2013-12-27 15:09:23
What you're running up against here is essentially the in-built deflationary nature of bitcoins. See, the total number of bitcoins in existence at any time is predetermined (by somebody who didn't know anything about economics, mind you) and fixed. The *total* number that would *ever* exist, if bitcoins continued to exist indefinitely, is also predetermined and fixed. This makes buying bitcoins extremely difficult. This is what's called the "supply of money" problem in macroeconomics.
See, with real money, when you want to get your hands on some, there is generally no shortage of willing suppliers. That's because *new money is created* by the movement of capital; there is generally no supply-side constraint on the capital market, because capital is literally always available for sale on the market. That's the virtue of an inflating monetary unit: It makes capital freely available to any who want and can afford it.
But bitcoins, by contrast, are built to be deflationary. Because the supply at any point in time is strictly regulated and finite, no new bitcoins can be created to meet the demand for them. If you want to buy bitcoins, you must *wait* until somebody else is ready to sell theirs. This creates a massive supply-side constraint on the movement of bitcoins through the market.
Put simply, there is no way around this. You're stuck with it, because bitcoins were simply created to be this way. It will *always* be very difficult to get your hands on them, the price will *always* be too high, because that's how they were designed … by someone who was not an economist, it's worth repeating.

The price floor on the US dollar is absolutely not zero. Krugman explained this in his column. The federal government guarantees the value of the dollar by policy and by law; as long as the United States exists, the dollar's value will not decline by more than about two percent per year over a multi-decade timeline, making the dollar a very good store of value.
Comparing the dollar to other monetary units just illustrates the point. Modern monetary units are secure stores of value.

@_date: 2013-12-30 16:22:56
These two things do not cancel out, because they refer to different parameters: supply, and market price. In practice, they end up negatively reinforcing each other.
If you imagine that bit coins are a freely traded security (they aren't), then you have the question of what *sets* the market price. Some like to say that "As with everything, opinion sets the market price," but this is incorrect. Securities, much like commodities, usually have some *backing value* that gives them an effective minimum market price.
Imagine I lend you $50, and you agree to pay me back $60 in a year. To back that promise, you put up your car as collateral. Your car has a *scrap-metal value* of $50; regardless of anything else, it can be sold for scrap for $50. So your collateral has an absolute minimum value of $50.
Now, to me, your loan is worth $60, because that's what you promised to pay. But if you default on that promise, I get your car, which I can sell for scrap for $50. So the least I can get out of the deal is the $50 I lent you, meaning I take a negligible loss if worse comes to worst. (I lose the 1.24% a break-even recuperation would cost me in inflation.)
Now, I can turn around and sell your loan to a third party. I'd ask for $60 for it, because that's nominally what it's worth to me. But as long as I get more than $50, I'm still taking a profit. Because your loan has a minimum value of $50 — because you put up that much collateral — that's the minimum price your loan will fetch on the open market. Your loan is *secured* to that minimum value.
But what's the minimum value of a bit coin? There isn't any. There's no value-of-last-resort associated with a bit coin. If I had one, I wouldn't be *guaranteed* to recoup anything from it. The only way I could liquidate it is by selling it to someone, and that someone could offer me literally any price at all for it. So the *floor value* of a bit coin is $0.
This breeds volatility. Because there's nothing of *real value* backing bit coins, the price fluctuates wildly. What's worse, if you look at the (admittedly sparse) historical data, you find that price fluctuations aren't actually linked to the price of any other security or commodity. Meaning the volatility in bit coin pricing is *random.* It's impossible to predict. Will it go up or down over any period of time you care to name? Nobody knows. Flip a coin and take your chances.
Since there's no futures market for bit coins, it's not even possible to hedge your position against changes in the market. There's no way to bet that bit coins will lose value. If you're in them, you have literally no choice but to strap in and hold on for the ride, and hope the price fluctuates upward so you can get out under break-even or better conditions.
That's bad.
The question of deflation is a supply-side problem. Because bit coins are of a fixed supply, one *anticipates* that the price will go up as long as the rate of demand growth remains positive. That means the rational position is always to hold. If you *imagine* that the rate of demand growth is positive, because the rate of supply growth is always going to be zero, then one anticipates that the market price will rise, which means the rational position is to hold, rather than selling. This puts a supply-side constraint on the issue, making it more difficult for new parties to get in … which, ironically, means the rate of demand growth *can't* be anticipated to be positive. The deflationary nature of the issue means people who would otherwise want to get in (driving demand) simply won't be able to, which will create a responsive demand shortfall that compounds the already described volatility problem.
The two problems don't cancel out. They *reinforce* each other. Volatility feeds the supply problem, and the supply problem feeds volatility. There's a sort of *harmonic resonance* effect between them, where each one makes the other worse.

The tax code already lays out all the various ways in which a person incurs tax liability while dealing in securities — securities meaning anything which is an asset that is not liquid; something worth money but that isn't money itself. Bitcoins are securities, so they're already covered under the tax code dealing with securities. Problem solved.

Your heart's in the right place, but you've got basically all your facts wrong.
Inflation happens when the supply of money grows faster than the demand for money. *That's all.* It's *not* about prices; price changes are a second-order *effect* of inflation, not a sign of inflation and certainly not a cause of inflation.
The demand for money is constantly growing. The *rate* at which it's growing varies wildly, but the *fact* that it's growing doesn't.
So the supply of money must grow to match the growth in the demand for money. If the supply of money is growing faster than the demand for money, then inflation results; the value of the monetary unit falls. If the supply of money *doesn't* grow faster than the demand, then *deflation* results; the value of the monetary unit increases.
Deflation is absolutely bad. It's *never* okay; it's *always* an economic crisis. Inflation, on the other hand, is more nuanced. Why? Because of *the movement of capital.*
Imagine you have some money you're not doing anything with. It's just sitting under your mattress. (We imagine that banks don't exist; it's the same story if they do, just more complex, and we can keep things simple by imagining they don't.) What's the *smart thing* for you to do with your money?
If the economy is deflating — that is, the demand for money is growing faster than the supply — then the smart play is for you to keep your money under your mattress. It's accruing value over time; your hoard of money will be worth more in a year than it's worth now. So if you just *wait,* you will literally take a profit.
That's why deflation is an unequivocal economic crisis. Because it *halts the flow of capital.* If you're sitting there holding your money and laughing at the profits you're taking, your money *isn't doing anything.* It's just *sitting there.* That's bad for the economy, because it means your money is effectively out of the system. It's not available for anybody to use for economic activity. It's just locked away.
But what about inflation? Well, if the economy is inflating, then your hoard of money is *losing* value gradually over time. Given a long enough time — we're talking longer than a human lifespan here, but these are principles — it'll evaporate away into irrelevance. So just sitting on your money is a *dumb idea,* because it means you'll lose it by waiting. That means you're motivated to get out there and *do something* with your money!
This is *good* for the economy. Because the only reason we have an economy is to put people who have money and aren't using it in contact with people who need money but don't have it. This keeps money moving, and makes interesting economic activity possible. So inflation is good, because it motivates people who have money to *invest it* in ways that give them a return that meets (or even exceeds) the rate of inflation. It keeps capital moving.
(This is all tied up in the velocity-of-money term in the equations the Forbes author uses. I'm explaining the same ideas in simpler, less mathematical terms.)
Now, what happens if the rate of inflation is *very high?* Remember I said that people who have money are motivated to invest it to get a rate of return equal to or higher than the rate of inflation. If the rate of inflation is already high, then people with capital seeking to invest it are forced to demand a very high return on their investments. That is, the *price of money* skyrockets. That's bad, because the people who need money won't be able to afford it; they won't be able to promise sufficiently high rates of return to convince people with money to hand it over. If you're going to lose such-and-such percent per year by just sitting on your money, but you'll lose *even more* by investing it, then you'll just sit on it. Obviously.
So what have we determined so far? That deflation is bad always; it halts the movement of capital. And inflation is bad *if* the rate is too high. But if the rate of inflation is low, then it's actually *good* for the economy. It keeps capital circulating, because people with it seek ways to preserve their principal but don't demand returns that are improbably high.
So let's sum up so far: Inflation is caused when the supply of money grows faster than the demand for money. Inflation is good — necessary, even — when the rate is low, but bad when the rate's too high. What's a good range for inflation? In an economy the size of the US dollar economy, a good target is between two and five percent.
Which is why our *current* rate of inflation — 1.25% — is seen as being too low. Money's not moving fast enough through our economy; new economic activity isn't happening fast enough because capital isn't flowing fast enough. We want the economy to run faster, which is why it's being stimulated.
How is an economy stimulated? Through the creation of new money. But this isn't as simple as you probably think; it's not about the guys at the Bureau of Engraving turning a knob on a printing press and spitting out more banknotes. That's just *currency,* and totally irrelevant to the economy. If that newly printed currency isn't backed by money stored on account in a bank, it will just continue to sit in a warehouse indefinitely.
No, the creation of new money happens through *lending.* Every time a dollar is lent against a reserve, new money is created.
Here's the classroom explanation of how this happens: Say you have $100 in currency in your pocket. You come to me; I'm a bank. You ask to open an account and deposit your $100 in currency. I take your currency and give you back an account number with a balance of $100 in it.
Let's pause here to look at the balance sheet. What do you have? You have a bank account with $100 in it. That's an asset worth $100. So your net worth is $100 (same as it was before you opened your account).
What about me? I have $100 in currency that I got from you, but I also have a $100 liability in the form of your deposit account. That means my net worth is zero.
(An important note: In the real world, banks never have a net worth of zero. They must be *capitalized.* But we're omitting that for simplicity.)
Now, a third party comes to me. Let's call him Bob. Bob wants to open a bakery, but he needs some money to buy an oven. A guy named Frank has an oven to sell, but he wants $50 and Bob can't afford that. So Bob comes to me looking for a loan.
I go over Bob's business plan and decide his proposal looks sound. So I lend him the $50. Let's imagine I give him $50 in currency, just to keep things simple.
Bob takes his $50 in currency, gives it to Frank, Frank gives him the oven, then Frank comes to me and opens an account. I take his $50 in currency and give him a bank account with a balance of $50 in it.
Now. Balance sheets again: You have an account with a balance of $100, making your net worth $100. Frank has an account worth $50, for a net worth of $50. Bob owes the bank $50, for a net worth of –$50. And me? I've got two assets: $100 in currency, and a loan worth $50. I've got two liabilities: Your $100 account and Frank's $50 account. So my books balance.
We just created $50. Where did it come from? From *Bob.* Bob came up with a business plan and convinced me that he'd be able to generate enough money through his future labor to pay me the balance of his loan, so I *created* the $50 to lend to him out of *nothing,* backed by Bob's debt to me.
That's how money is created: Through lending. Every dollar that exists is backed by a dollar's worth of debt.
How does this relate to inflation? Because if that activity is happening too fast — loans are being extended to the tune of too many dollars per month — then the supply of money is growing faster than the demand for money. That makes the price of money fall, and economic activity tapers off constrained by demand. If it's happening too slowly, then the supply of money isn't growing fast enough to meet demand, and the price rises, and economic activity, again, tapers off, this time constrained by supply.
For the most part, this is a self-regulating system. If the supply of money is growing too fast, money will be cheap, and people who've been waiting to do something interesting will snatch up bargains, causing a surge in demand that balances things out again. If the price of money is too high, lenders will compete with each other for the reduced number of borrowers, bringing the price back down again. But the system doesn't *always* self-regulate as fast or effectively as it needs to, so that's why we have things like the federal funds rate and open-market operations, which I won't bother going into, but suffice to say they're like a big gas and brake pedal that can be used to accelerate or slow down the economy as needed.
Which, in a nutshell, is why central banking works.
Now, what have I *not* talked about at all? Prices and spending. There's a reason for that. Spending is noise-level economic activity. It's a *side-effect* of economic activity, essentially. People need milk and bread and shelter and all that and they use money to pay for it, but that's a *tiny* part of the picture. Wages and prices change in response to inflation and deflation, yes, but again, those are second-order effects. They're *indicators* of inflation, but not *causes* of inflation. (Nor is the need for subsistence spending a mitigator of deflation, for the record.) What really matters in an economy is the flow of capital, and the resulting creation of wealth. Those are the things that count. Wages, prices and spending are side-effects that happen around the perimeter, and should not be mistaken for core behaviors.

Even if they weren't required to by bank regulations, they all would, since bank customers value the service of having their deposits insured for them.

Because inflation happens when the supply of money grows faster than the demand for money. The supply of money is presently growing only a *tiny bit* faster than the demand for money — one and a quarter percent per year faster. In order to see a "large spike in inflation," the supply of money would have to grow ten percent faster than the demand for it, and that simply hasn't happened. The economy is *fundamentally* healthy — the demand for money is high and growing steadily — but because confidence was shaken and lending reserves were tied up in assets both real and toxic, the supply of money available for sale on the capital market couldn't grow to meet demand. That's why we needed to create new money and get it into the capital market, so the demand for capital could be met.

Several reasons, but the first of which is that those problems don't actually *exist.* For fun, I just checked to see how long it would take and what it would cost for Western Union to get the local equivalent of $100 to Bhutan, a country I chose at random. The answer? Fifteen minutes, and twelve dollars. Effectively instantaneous and free. If I want to pay less, I can make it an overnight transfer instead.
But imagine you wanted to try to beat that. You'd need something that's faster *or* cheaper *or* significantly easier.
Let's start with the significantly-easier thing. How do you send money internationally via Western Union? You go to the web site any time, day or night, and key in a credit card number. Press a button, and you're done. The money is available to the recipient minutes later. If you don't have a credit card, a bank account number and routing number will do the job. You really can't get any easier than that.
What's the bit coin solution? Well, first I need to figure out how to buy bit coins. You've already lost the battle, right there out of the gate. Why do I need to buy special company scrip just to send money somewhere? The answer is I don't, but bit coiners think I should. Oh, they say, that's only a problem right now because you don't have bit coins already; in the future everyone will. But of course this ignores the fact that I *won't* unless I have a *reason to.* Which brings us to point number two: Speed.
How long does a Western Union money transfer take? As little as fifteen minutes. Can a bit coin transaction clear in the same amount of time? *Only if you're willing to do an unconfirmed transaction.* Which of course nobody is. So bit coins lose on speed.
What about cost? It would cost me $12 to send the local equivalent of $100 to Bhutan. Can bit coins be cheaper? Maybe. But only if I'm willing to jump through many more hoops and have the process take much longer — days, instead of minutes.
So if those are the problems you want to solve, bit coins are the wrong solution. You take something fast, easy and safe and replace it with something slow, complicated and risky.

Gosh, I'm not even sure where to begin here. You've got a lot of really bad information, apparently. When we talk about the supply of money, we aren't talking about *people having money.* We're talking about money for sale on the capital market. Nobody "just sits on" money, because money is always either invested or stored as lending capital in a bank. You've got the wrong idea about everything.

You're not overthinking it. You're thinking about just the right things.
It's common in business for big-ticket invoices to be paid by bank wire transfer. To this end, invoices include an account number (twelve digits) and bank routing number (nine digits).

This isn't a good stance to take. If you bet it all on a nebulous competitive advantage, then it all vanishes when people don't agree with you.

They do. Whether they have *as much as they want* is a wholly separate topic and unrelated to anything we're discussing. Money is legal tender, which means it is guaranteed by law to be accepted as payment for all debts. Literally every person has equal access to money *under the law.* You don't need to go looking for somebody who has money in order to get some of your own, because everybody has it. That's what "legal tender" means in practice.

@_date: 2013-12-24 16:26:29
First, what bitcoins are *not.*
They are not a currency. I know a lot of people say they are, but that's a simple error of fact. Currency is a *tangible artifact that represents money.* Banknotes and coins are currency. Bitcoins are not, and could never have been, currency, because they are not tangible.
The "paper wallet" you are giving — not a great gift, by the way, but here we are — is *sort of* akin to a banknote, but we'll get to why it's not in a little bit.
Okay, so bitcoins are not currency. What are they, then? Well, they were *meant* to be a *monetary unit.* Like a dollar, or a pound. That was the idea. But unfortunately, they were designed in such a way, and have been "adopted," such as they are, in such a way, as to make that quite impossible. See, a monetary unit is defined as being three things: a store of value, a medium of exchange and legal tender. Bitcoins qualify as none of those. They're not a store of value because they don't hold their value; their value fluctuates like the surface of a pot of boiling water. And they're not a medium of exchange because they're accepted as payment for debts by basically nobody. And they aren't legal tender because they simply *aren't.* So bitcoins cannot honestly be described as a monetary unit.
So what are they, then? They're an *unbacked security.* A security is anything that can be bought and sold. It's the most generic term for a financial instrument. Why do we call bitcoins a security? Because they don't qualify as anything more specific! Their *sole characteristic* is that they can be bought and sold; that's all they can be used for. So we can call them a security … and nothing else.
What does "unbacked" mean? A security is usually *backed* by something. For instance, a loan is a security. If you owe me $10, I can sell that loan to somebody else for any price up to $10 (or more, if the person I'm selling to is an idiot). But that loan is *backed* by something. It's backed by your promise to pay. It's backed by your debt, in other words.
What are bitcoins backed by? Well … nothing, actually. They have value only because people think they have value. A bitcoin will never mature; it'll never transform itself into a thing of actual value. It will have value if and only if the person holding it is able to find somebody who's willing to buy it. Right now, a small number of people (in the scale of these sorts of things) are still willing to buy bitcoins. Will that be true tomorrow? Who knows? Maybe. Will it be true at some point in the indefinite future? It is unlikely.
So bitcoins, then, are essentially a race to profit. Think of them as being like Beanie Babies. Remember when those were being snatched up like crazy by people who thought they would become collectable? For a short time, a significant number of people were able to take profits by selling their Beanie Babies to people who thought they were much more valuable than they were. But soon the number of buyers fell effectively to zero, and people who were left holding Beanie Babies they wanted to sell were quite out of luck.
That's what bitcoins are. They're something that should be sold as quickly as possible to take whatever profits can be taken from them. The rational actor sees bitcoins as free money; right now there are greater fools willing to pay insane prices for them, so they should be taken up on their offer as quickly as possible. Run, don't walk, to a computer and sell them while you still can.
That's why those "paper wallets" you're talking about aren't equivalent to banknotes. Banknotes represent monetary units, and bitcoins are not monetary units. "Paper wallets" are more akin to penny-stock certificates. They're the tangible representation of a thing which should be sold as *quickly as possible* to take whatever profits happen to be available while the market is still inflated.
Which, of course, raises the question of why you're going through the trouble of giving them instead of just giving a small amount of cash. But that's a matter of personal taste. If you want to give something that's money-only-inconvenient, nobody can stop you.

It *still* comes down to a business case. If their business is dependent on donations, and setting up bit coins would cost them $X, and they'd get $Y in new donations for having done it — as long as that's *new* donations, not donations they would've gotten anyway — then if $Y is greater than $X, you have a business case.
No amount of "I think" or "you should" will amount to anything if the business case isn't there.

Not at all. Ripple is exactly the same, only with their "XRP" as their own company scrip.
Let me put it this way. My bank (as do all banks I'm aware of) offers me the ability to send money to anybody instantly as long as I have an email address or mobile phone number that can receive a text. I don't have to buy into bank scrip to make that work, nor does my recipient have to cash out of bank scrip on the other end of the transaction. All I need is an address or phone number and an amount, and it's done. And what's more, I'm protected each step of the way from fraud and error. It's a system that *works.* If the notional "BitCoin" network worked like that, it would've had the potential to be a real innovation, a valuable new transaction product. But it doesn't, which curtails its utility to the point of being useless.

That's not the argument. The argument is that bitcoins are valuable because they're superior for making payments. That requires no infrastructure to be built; it's all there right out of the gate. But people are *not using* bitcoins for payments. So where does their purported value come from again?
If you want to move the goalposts to say that all the value of a bitcoin comes from some nebulous future maybe-someday thing, that's fine, you can do that. But you just undermined the value proposition you sought to establish.

No, no. A monetary unit and a currency are two different things. A monetary unit is a medium of exchange (thing used for the negotiation of debts), a store of value (the thing in which accounts are denominated), and legal tender. Currency is merely a *tangible proxy* that represents money in certain types of transactions.
The dollar is a monetary unit. Banknotes and coins denominated in dollars are currency. They're entirely different things which behave entirely differently, economically.

Well, yes and no. The quote-unquote decentralized ledger in theory means that as long as software is working and Internet access is uninterrupted transactions should be able to be processed *in theory.* But in practice, it takes anywhere from minutes to days for transactions to go through, depending on how much bribery is involved in the queueing. So in one sense, the bitcoins transaction system is immune to disruption, but in another sense it is constantly disrupted. It really depends on how you look at it.

"The network effect" has no credibility left, I'm afraid. It's been used too often as an excuse ("Adoption of bitcoins is below pace because of the network effect") and a prediction ("By this time next year, your 401(k) will be denominated in bitcoins because of the network effect") too often. It can't be included in any value proposition.

You mean "monetary unit," except it doesn't meet the qualifications to be a monetary unit either.

Actually it kind of does mean that bitcoins are going away, or more to the point, already have. See, all the things that make bitcoins a speculative investment vehicle *prevent it* from being used as a medium of exchange or as a store of value. Money is defined as being a store of value, a medium of exchange and legal tender. Bitcoins are *none* of those. Which means bitcoins are not working as they were meant to: as a new, independent monetary unit.
If your position is "Then bitcoins aren't money, they're a security instead," that's totally fine, and completely in line with reality. But if your position is "No, bitcoins are totally money," then I'm afraid your position is not really supported by the facts.

Many jurisdictions have laws that prohibit discriminatory pricing based on the method of payment. Not all do, but they're common. Common enough that anybody who does business across jurisdictions will set uniform pricing regardless of payment method.


That's absolutely correct. People who claim that bitcoin transactions are instantaneous are simply not telling the truth. The transaction is not actually completed until confirmations come in (as many as the parties require, from one on up), which is why bitcoins transactions are so impossibly slow.
Imagine trying to use bitcoins to do business at a Starbucks at 7:55 in the morning. It would be a disaster, completely impossible.
The solution to this is really to convince people that they don't need to wait for confirmation to consider a transaction closed. Good luck with this, however, since the whole point of bitcoins is that transactions aren't closed until confirmation is received.


Not really, because they would have to sell all the bitcoins they receive immediately in order to protect themselves against volatility losses. The problem with this, of course, is that Amazon (in this example) would become a bitcoin *source,* constantly selling bitcoins for the best price they can get, diving the market price of bitcoins down as they do. It would be self-defeating (and incidentally is the number-one reason we use money today instead of commodity bartering).


Well, that's rather a blue-sky outlook. Bitcoins are obscure, complex and unnecessary. To say that their obscurity and complexity will be magically solved by new enterprises is speculative thinking at best, and downright fantasy at worst. The question is not whether bitcoins will be made accessible and simple; the question is whether they *can.* And that's a much harder question indeed, particularly in light of the fact that nobody needs bitcoins. We already have alternatives that work much better than bitcoins do, which removes the motivation for anybody to rush to market right away. Bitcoins would have to be *much better* than the existing preferred alternatives, and it simply isn't. Can it be made better? Who knows? Before one can get at that question one must get past the "what's this good for" question.

No, it's $12, which is effectively free. As I told somebody else who made the same mistake, the fee scale slides. That's the *most* you would pay for the *fastest* service. If you don't like that totally negligible fee, you can pay less for slower service.

Well, that's really kind of the thing, isn't it? Some people say that "BitCoin" is a payment processing network … but it really isn't. You can't access the payment processing network without first buying into this other commodity called a bit coin. If you don't have bit coins, "BitCoin" is completely closed off to you.
Which naturally raises the question of what would've happened if "BitCoin," the transaction product, had been built instead to deal with transactions denominated in actual money rather than in what is basically the 21st century equivalent of company scrip.
@_date: 2013-12-23 15:22:24
That's an inapt comparison. The Internet is a *physical thing* with cables and routers and stuff. It had to be built, in the same sense that a road has to be built. It took time for the physical connections to be made that allowed it to become as ubiquitous as it is today. (Not to mention, wifi had to be invented.)
All the "obvious advantages" of bitcoins are *here today.* There's nothing stopping people from using them as designed right now. Except people are staying away in droves. Why? Well, tons of reasons, but the first two that come up are the activation energy and the lack of security.
Which is my whole point. If you say "Bitcoins derive 100% of their value from their utility," then you have nothing left when people say "They have no utility because they're a pain in the butt to use, therefore they have no value."

Not in the economic sense of the word, no, because bitcoins do not represent a good. They have no intrinsic value; you can't eat them, or use them in manufacturing, or fuel your car with them or anything like that. Commodities exist, as an economic thing, because people need to consume them. Nobody needs to consume bitcoins; the concept doesn't even apply.
What bitcoins actually are, in the economic sense, are an unbacked security. A security is a thing which can be bought and sold but which has no *direct* intrinsic value itself. Securities usually have an *indirect* intrinsic value of some sort. For instance, a stock share has no value in and of itself, but it represents part ownership of a company which has hard assets with a real market value. So the share in question is said to be *backed* by the value of the company. But bitcoins aren't backed by anything at all. So they're a security, in the sense that they can be bought and sold for money, but they're an unbacked security. They have no indirect intrinsic value.

Not true at all. You're assuming fixed demand, which as I just illustrated is not a valid assumption.


No. The dollar, like all monetary units, is legal tender, meaning if nothing else you always have to pay your taxes and other debts with it. This gives the dollar a non-zero intrinsic value.

Given the rate of adoption, it's pretty safe to say that we don't.
The bottom line here is that anybody who tries to reinvent money from scratch will end up doing one of two things: Either they'll screw it up completely by making a mistake the rest of the world learned from and corrected decades or centuries ago, or they'll just stumble their way through, step by step, until they've exactly reproduced the status quo. You can reinvent the wheel if you want, but either you'll get it wrong, or you'll end up with something round.

Okay, so close the circle. What does bit coin prevent, and what's the value of it?
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:12:22
Yes, money is created through lending. What's the holdup there?
Bitcoins are difficult to obtain because they can *only* be created through mining, which has effectively come to a halt and will come to an absolute halt at a specific point in the future. They can only be acquired by buying them from somebody who's ready to sell them. With "wider acceptance," bitcoins would be *even harder* to obtain, because the finite supply would be spread out among more holders.
@_date: 2013-12-29 16:33:11
No, it's difficult because it's equivalent to buying into company scrip. Except the company scrip is inherently deflationary, because the rate of growth of supply is predetermined and fixed (and decreasing to zero). Which means if you want to buy in, you must wait until somebody is willing to sell to you at the price you're willing to pay. *That's* why buying in is difficult. Blaming it on imagined flaws in a monetary system that's worked since the 1500s is just foolish.

@_date: 2013-12-23 15:38:23


That is not actually supported by any facts. But setting that aside, the issue bitcoins face is not volatility *qua* volatility. It's the fact that changes in the market price are not caused by anything except movements in the market itself. When other commodities rise and fall, bitcoins do their own thing, in complete isolation. That makes it impossible to predict what the bitcoins market will do. That's a major barrier to adoption.
If people want bitcoins to be a thing, they will need to face these realities. Sticking their heads in the sand and making predictions counter to established fact doesn't help anyone.

@_date: 2013-12-28 18:09:04
The problem with your admittedly far-from-the-truth explanation of how real money works is that it's *so* far from the truth that anybody who knows about the topic will smell the bullshit and anybody who doesn't will be deeply confused. If you want to start by drawing a comparison to real money, start by talking about fractional reserve lending (because that's how money is created; it's absolutely not printed and has nothing to do with any forts).
If you want to explain the appeal of bitcoins, talk about the appeal of using your credit card to pay for things. It's quick, it's secure, you never have to deal with making or receiving change, all that. Then talk about how it would be nice to use credit cards to exchange money between individuals, instead of just between individuals and businesses. You can't do that, because of how credit cards work, but there's this new thing called a bitcoin that sort of works like a credit card (only slower and harder to use) between individuals. Then you'll get all the obvious "Oh, so it's like" questions, and you can explain the various ways in which it's different.
Do not claim that bitcoins don't have fees, because they do; the fees are all over the place. Do not talk about wallets, because that's just confusing. Don't ever talk about mining or blocks or any of that stuff, because literally no one cares. Instead, do two things: First, focus on what bitcoins *are actually good for,* and then, second, be honest about the various ways in which they're not actually very good. That's how you get people to understand.
Oh, and if the person you're talking to says "Yeah, my bank already lets me email money to anybody," pack it in. Because they're right, and you can't beat that.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:27:56

I have my doubts as to how many people will actually read the paper, much less the linked article, but there's actual *fact* here that the community will have to face sooner or later. Even just from the abstract:


I've been saying this for a long time. Advocates for bitcoins say things like "look how great it is for making payments" and "it's awesome that it's deflationary," and they completely miss the bigger picture. When the most naive question is asked — "How do I deposit it in a bank?" — the answers tend to be ludicrous and borderline antisemitic rants against the evils of banking. That really couldn't be more disconnected from reality. We don't use things like banks and mortgages because we're enslaved; we use them because they're *useful.* For the bitheads to come along and demand that we abolish five hundred years of evolved economic ideas because of their conspiracy theories is just laughable.
If bitcoins are to continue to exist at all, sooner or later the bitheads are going to have to start speaking plain English. That means acknowledging that things like preservation of principal and risk mitigation exist, and addressing their pet funnymoney's inability to participate in those core functions of modern finance. Otherwise, bitcoins are going to continue to be a paleolithic throwback to the barter system, and not taken seriously by anyone.

You do know we went off the gold standard for a reason, right? The gold standard is *empirically bad* from a macroeconomic standpoint. The reason the Great Depression went on so long is because economies couldn't expand the money supply to stimulate the flow of capital. The so-called "Great Recession" of the late 2000s would've been far worse were it not possible to create new money to stimulate lending and reduce the cost of capital.
I really don't understand how people can think that the gold standard was a good thing. I guess it's a grass-is-greener phenomenon. They see the current system and macroeconomy and declare that it stinks (for reasons nobody is ever able to articulate), and therefore something different must be better, despite the fact that we *know for sure* it isn't.
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:41:25


Guy's got a point. Why should a vendor be the one to shoulder the extra cost and hassle, when you can cash your coins out and spend money a lot more easily?
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:56:56
Yes, it's totally valid. The key sentence there is the one that says bitcoin takes finance back a hundred years. What a lot of bitcoin advocates fail to realize is that *we do things the way we do them for a reason.* The art of economics and the business of finance have been evolving for centuries. They work the way they work because of lessons learned from past mistakes. Bitcoins ignore those lessons (or more to the point, were created by somebody who was never aware of them in the first place) and so make it possible to repeat those past mistakes.

If it were me, I would've chosen *nothing* as the basis for the transaction network, because the network has value if and only if you can move *what you want to move* over it. We've all seen how onerous it is to push dollars (or euros, or yen) through the "BitCoin" network. That's because the network was designed from the ground up to be closed. You have to buy into it if you want to use it, then you must cash out of it on the other end. That limits its utility *severely.*

Bitcoins do not compete with banks. They *need* banks, or something that performs the same role in the same way as banks under a different name, to be viable.
What you call (incredibly wrongly) "money printing" is actually fractional reserve lending, and it's the foundation of a healthy economy. Without it, bit coins are doomed to a deflationary crisis that would make them totally unsuitable as a medium of exchange. Not that we'd ever have to worry about that, but just saying.
