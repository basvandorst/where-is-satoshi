From what I understand the Ether people could have prevented replay attacks, but didn't because they didn't foresee this happening?

So are you a whale on Bitfinex?
@_date: 2016-08-02 16:20:02
Both forks will have their coins intact.  I dont see why some people are scared of letting the market decide.

Etherium looks like its losing to its little brother.

Hodler since early 2011.  Except for a few physical Bitcoins I've diversified.

Yeah instead of a company working to pay their users back, lets send it to bankruptcy court where you probably wont get anything back ever.

If you've ever sold a coin or paid for something with bitcoin you've probably sold to a "speculator"

So they only lost ETC? Why do they need to buy it back if they don't sell it? 
@_date: 2016-07-30 20:22:58
Hasn't ETH forked a few other times? Is coinbase also responsible for those minor chains too?

Something corrects after rising 350% in a day? NO way?
