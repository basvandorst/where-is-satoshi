Better change your passwords. Settings allow the app to see everything going on in your phone
@_date: 2019-07-28 15:44:51

@_date: 2019-07-12 06:22:57
Yup everyone is concerned while I’m her like HOLY SHIT the president acknowledge bitcoin!!!

@_date: 2019-07-12 06:21:09
You must have forgotten the amount of people that follow just to shit on trump, which is almost every comment under his post lol. You have to scroll for awhile to find support for him haha
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:53:57
THIS IS BULLISH SCREENSHOT THE HISTORY.. I KNOW MY ASS WILL. This is super bullish
@_date: 2019-07-12 06:02:37
People Seriously don’t understand how fucking bullish this shit is. Trump and Facebook going at each other. Going to buy buy buy
@_date: 2019-07-12 06:21:43
Yeah, I’m going to scoop up some bitty soon.
@_date: 2019-07-12 06:22:14
They are going to try and make it that way..
@_date: 2019-07-31 06:53:58
Reckless gambling
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:55:51
Confirmation bias... please don’t take predictions literally... it’s just a predictions, sure it’s plausible to play out that way. Doesn’t mean it will..
@_date: 2019-07-12 06:24:23
You aren’t wrong, but he even acknowledging crypto currency tells me they are about to fight hard to shut this crypto currency shit down lol
@_date: 2019-07-31 23:23:35
I knowwwww I need to get back into crypto ASAP... only was holding alts so getting out was a good decision on my end
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:17:15
People were saying this during the 2018 bear market. It could be, but don’t lose all your damn money hoping for some random upswing.. unless you are planning on being here for the long haul.
@_date: 2019-07-12 06:49:27
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:56:32
If it breaks 9,200 then maybe.. otherwise nope uptrend still intact
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:58:53
Honestly I want to say you are wrong, but you are right... they’ll just ignore this tweet and focus on other tweets.. lol
@_date: 2019-07-28 15:58:14
If this wasn’t posted in a bitcoin sub then yes it would work. It’s saying Instead of worrying about what you look like in 40 years worry about that retirement fund. This works, sorry if you guys disagree with my sentiment on this. It isn’t that serious at the end of the day
@_date: 2019-03-07 19:26:35
You can’t fine bitcoin... WE BULLISH GUYS
@_date: 2019-03-11 18:20:56
My only wish is my dumbass could go back in time and not put a dime in crypto and put all my money into weed stocks... i got good gains from them.. but couldn't help but think that all the money I lost in crypto could have gone straight into weed stocks and I would have walked away RICH... oh well.. crypto still has a place in my heart.
@_date: 2019-11-29 07:18:19
It wouldn’t be a bad perspective from someone in that age range though. Get a good sense of where others are at in that group
@_date: 2019-11-29 07:14:34
Must not have been a close friend lol
@_date: 2019-11-29 07:13:09
When lambo?
@_date: 2019-11-29 07:13:48
This is true, there is a pattern though, doesn’t mean it’ll pan out
@_date: 2019-11-29 07:20:35
Also why 20k holders are waiting for big big numbers for bitcoin. Goal is to hold all btc and sell some alts
@_date: 2019-11-29 07:19:11
@_date: 2019-11-29 07:16:12
It exploded because of the huge price spike. Breaking 20k again would trigger another rush for the old bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-28 07:19:31
@_date: 2019-11-29 07:16:44
You get it, most only will join when thing are a for sure thing.

See that is what others need to understand. Some people are willing to take on the risk and know damn well what could go wrong and right. So others will judge and say you’re an idiot blahhh blah blah... he knew the risk and he’ll deal with his decision down the road. I would recommend him have at least a savings account just Incase shit in the real world go wrong. Bitcoin fluctuates a lot and you may need the money and when BTC dumps or has a bad day you’re fucked.
@_date: 2019-03-07 19:26:46
“Worth it”
@_date: 2019-11-12 03:49:57
Now looking back at my comment... derrrrrrrrpppp
@_date: 2019-03-11 18:21:45
well those get rich quick scheme people are dropping like flies.. i'll tell you that..
@_date: 2019-11-09 10:48:25
My ass is hoping it drops down a good bit more
@_date: 2019-11-11 13:33:29
Stopped staring at charts for awhile but this is a good reminder post is a good reminder for people.
@_date: 2019-11-29 07:11:55
@_date: 2019-11-29 07:21:08
Exactly cracking 20k will be interesting as hell to see how the market reacts.
@_date: 2019-11-29 07:11:23
If you’re in the 1% you are stressing about money lol
@_date: 2019-11-30 13:34:19
@_date: 2019-11-30 04:31:50
Then more red candles down and down
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:07:25
I guess. Just don’t put all your eggs in one basket.

@_date: 2019-11-29 07:09:51
@_date: 2019-03-12 02:40:14
Well yeah, the masses have. Honestly going to start buying soon, need to get in while things are somewhat cheap
@_date: 2019-11-11 13:33:55
Be the one that disappoints
@_date: 2019-11-29 07:15:17
Yeah, some are calling for 3k or 4k
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:49:42
@_date: 2019-08-18 11:50:26
Laughed a little harder than I should have at this.. lol
@_date: 2019-08-15 10:46:40
Hardly lol
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:49:26
@_date: 2019-08-15 18:53:07
Guess I need to wait until September to start buying ��‍♀️
@_date: 2019-08-31 20:06:01
It just looks tacky imo lol but it’s not my car so mehhh
@_date: 2019-08-09 21:29:03
Perfect vehicle, you can flex in broad daylight and people won’t believe that you actually are rich af
@_date: 2019-10-29 03:30:22
I agree with the drawing. A revisit for 4K would be great for a bottom test for bitcoin price. About to start buying a portion weekly once I get other things in order.
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:44:57
Ummmm yessssssss
@_date: 2019-08-31 19:03:21
The USA is not it chief

Okay this is dank hahah
@_date: 2019-06-15 12:37:18
Rich gang
@_date: 2019-08-15 10:45:13
I hope you made it big off crypto...
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:28:04
Hopefully that becomes a thing this time. We struggling right now fam
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:22:39
To tell them you sold completely out of BTC when it reached $1,000
@_date: 2019-06-15 07:35:44
I’m excited but don’t want blue balls.. my excitement is chill for now
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:50:36
Very true haha!!
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:25:39
What? Hahaha
@_date: 2019-06-16 07:21:39
I would still hold some BTC since there is only so much BTC left to go around.. alts are a lot more risky, however ROI can potentially be higher..
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:48:38
Set alerts on your phone, that’ll stop your constant curiosity. If Bitcoin or your alt moved to a certain point you get notified and then check.. it’s no different that Instagram or Facebook quick browsing, just don’t get caught up in the daily swings and worry about the bigger picture. Alerts will help a lot with your issue.
@_date: 2019-06-02 03:36:48
Bitcoin will never fall by 99%, 80% though
@_date: 2019-06-08 17:32:43
Too much effort tbh..
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:21:13
Yeah 1k is insane! Now a few dollars okay then.. but 1k is robbery and on top of that they probably charge fees.
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:51:53
Fucking facts
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:52:24
It’s a sign that you need to not get caught up in the euphoria and take profits on the way up. Don’t try to time the top.
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:42:11
Honestly this is fun to watch. I can sit back in chill as I have some big bags in some alts.. this time around I don’t have to FOMO since I locked in my positions. Will I buy more crypto when I can? Hell yeah! BTC can do whatever now, I’m excited to see how things play out :)
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:32:08
Don’t blow my hopium high.. ��
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:24:05
Well like all things in life, there is risk vs reward. I’m holding until I have life changing money. Then I will sell. :)
@_date: 2019-06-15 07:34:31
@_date: 2019-06-14 17:09:23
I wanna call and troll
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:56:16
Some would argue we were never in a bull market
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:41:21
Nahh, y’all will just buy back in. I don’t have weak hands, I just know a dollar amount I’ll be satisfied with and once that is reached I will cash out 75% of my funds and let the rest ride
@_date: 2019-06-16 07:19:30
Odds are better than the powerball/mega millions...
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:02:19
Hahaha, must not have gotten the reception he was hoping for
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:51:26
Got the same feeling right now, waiting for my 1000x gains
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:36:27
Pretty much what I’m betting on tbh. Betting on people’s ignorance.. happened last bullrun and all the others.. just pick some “utilities” coins and call the lambo dealership while waiting for new money in the market to pump your bags.
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:26:14
@_date: 2019-06-02 03:38:42
Let me just draw some lines and that’ll be where bitcoin will go to
@_date: 2019-06-16 07:16:37
You are correct, 20k+ will cause HUGE fomo. 10k+ will store a bit of interest.
@_date: 2019-06-17 12:11:04
Don’t worry guys it’s all good. *presses market sell*
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:56:01
Exactly, literally this bear market stomped on my balls so much that swings up and down don’t bother me anymore. Focusing on the day to day instead of the long term is a great way to drive you crazy. My  rule is if I buy a crypto, there will be no selling it period unless I plan on completely exiting the position and never going back to it. I’m not going to let hindsight eat me alive because I kept buying and selling coins instead of just holding.
Edit: I don’t want to be like,”man if I had just held those 20 coins instead of coins I would have been up blah blah blah money” that’s not going to be me. Sure I’ll miss some ungodly gains from coins I passed on, but I won’t be missing any gains from coins I decided to hold onto.
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:28:45
I’m sorry this image is cringe as fuck. Dope as fuck car but man still a cringe photo
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:05:18
40 cents off is significant.. but I'd rather keep my btc and want for it to moon more than spend it on gas.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:48:33
Good guess lol. 11k inbound
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:30:45
Literally me right now, I work grave yard shift and should be sleeping right now.. buttttt bitcoin is about to hit 10k.. sooo..
@_date: 2019-06-16 07:20:52
Need to buy some of that. Ughhh wish my funds weren’t tied up this week. I could technically spend some money on crypto, but I need to be responsible with my money. Lol already got a big bag on some lotto picks that have a use case
@_date: 2019-06-02 12:16:43
Congrats you got a bitcoin miner and keylogger installed on your computer. Don’t download shit from any crypto related videos, just asking to get hacked
@_date: 2019-08-31 16:30:54
This is a no for me..
@_date: 2019-06-16 07:18:27
Yawnnn, it’s either going to go up or down. TA says we should go down but BTC doesn’t care. I wouldn’t think about shorting until the trend has been confirmed to have changed.. the trend is your friend and for now it seems we finna moon!
@_date: 2019-08-11 04:58:01
Because he cashed out some crypto in 2017 and bought back in and is holding
@_date: 2019-06-02 03:36:11
No I love those guys, keep btc down until I get more crypto
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:25:51
Pretty much.. they’ll FOMO in if we break that 10k
@_date: 2019-06-17 03:37:44
Honestly cringe af
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:44:35
Most true whales won’t cash out anytime soon
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:07:23
don't fucking do it. if you can afford to eat the loan you took out if your investments go south then sure..
@_date: 2019-06-02 03:38:10
Exactly, not going to smoke the Hopium but it’d be dope to see bitcoin at those prices
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:40:01
I mean you get $10 of Btc which is not bad. Don’t expect to get rich from it, but even owning small amounts of BtC is good
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:40:07
Past performance doesn’t pred...... fuck it never mind
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:26:44
Always wondered why people made a big deal about this.. thanks for the answer
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:42:17
It’s on a downtrend. Better short the bottom
@_date: 2019-06-14 17:11:16
Buffet doesn’t invest in things he doesn’t understand plus the dude is a billionaire and doesn’t need to invest in bitcoin. Plus he is old as fuck, he doesn’t need to care
@_date: 2019-06-18 19:15:11
@_date: 2019-06-16 09:39:56
Yeah I was about to say, I’m sure some asshole dumped on the market
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:06:15
20k would have to be crossed for LAMBO MOON FOMO... we will get fomo from people who have been eyeing the market and waiting on the dip.. lol
@_date: 2019-06-02 06:08:58
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:03:35
Sell just enough to not have to worry about bills for like 5 years, then continue to hodl
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:51:35
FOMO is after 20k, what we are seeing now is people who waited to buy the dip.
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:53:40
Okay, I laughed...
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:48:32
So you are saying there will be lambos?
@_date: 2019-06-18 12:37:20
Well at the end of the day all we have is ourselves to worry about. Fuck everyone else, it’s dog eat dog world. No one will be around to hold your head as your world crumbles.
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:46:22
I used to flip out about the markets and now I see 20% drops and just wonder when is the next time I can buy more?
@_date: 2019-06-02 03:35:36
Cheap joke
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:19:19
People have been waiting on a healthy pull back for awhile... :/ lol
@_date: 2019-06-04 07:50:29
I am numb lol I kept ignorantly buying all the way down in 2018. Not serious money but still. These swings mean nothing on a macro scale
@_date: 2019-06-02 03:35:18
Yassss, May take several weeks,months or years to get your 10btc
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:45:43
Sofucking happy I locked in my positions before these run ups. Now I can just sit back and watch as everyone else loses their shit with FOMO
@_date: 2019-06-16 07:14:04
Yassssssssss, calling the lambo dealership now!
@_date: 2019-06-15 07:34:43
Time to dump
@_date: 2019-06-16 07:17:08
Really to jizz from the FOMO buys
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:56:44
I’ll buy both, can’t lose then
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:10:07
Can we go back to 3k already?
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:50:48
Yup if this happens everyone I was talking to crypto about that ignored me will be ringing my phone. I’ll just shoot them some YouTube videos and tell them it’s their decision to buy.. lol
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:54:02
By next week? I got some things I want
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:20:03
I mean buy what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:28:56
Nope, I want to feel the flurry of excitement through this forum
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:48:07
Until Bitcoin goes to 100k lol
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:10:27
When everyone around you all of a sudden starts talking about bitcoin..(stores,work,school) its time to either be cashing out or exiting very soon. Don’t get caught up in the euphoria and at least sell some coins to lock in profits
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:19:40
I will cash out funds that’ll pay my bills for the next year and then hodl. All I care is about financial freedom than lambos n shit
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:34:57
A sign we are nearing the top is when EVERYONE is winning. We don’t know how this shit will play out. Yeah sure btc is best to hold long term. But alts if you pick the right one like LTC or some shit like that.. you gone sit pretty pretty holding that over btc.
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:54:47
I laughed way harder than I should have at this
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:41:47
Pretty much,can’t wait for the news and everyone to get hype about crypto again. All those people I talked about crypto with will be asking me how to buy now that bitcoin is on an uptrend.
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:27:36
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:15:41
Bye bye money
@_date: 2019-06-16 04:49:52
Fucking jizzing right now, if we blast through to 10k I’ll die �� hope 9k becomes support
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:44:12
@_date: 2019-06-05 04:03:34
Here’s an idea... use another service
@_date: 2019-06-05 04:10:44
Then after buying the ledger don’t use it(me)
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:31:10
Plan to hold for a year and it shouldn’t be a problem. Don’t pay attention to day to day trading and you’ll be fine.
@_date: 2019-06-04 07:04:52
Op, 10% swings are huge. Holding through that takes some serious consideration... also Depends how risk adverse you are. Experiencing the bear market last year and bull run in 2017 it has helped me adjust to the swings. I’m personally willing to hold through major dumps and pumps until I reach the price I want. Didn’t join the space for serious investing, just picking some coins I think are solid and have a use case and periodically accumulate. If we go to the moon I’ll be doing very well if not, well I never invested money I didn’t assume was already gone from the get go.
@_date: 2019-06-09 13:50:00
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:01:49
Delete this post, it ain’t 9k yet we are training right now
@_date: 2019-06-16 09:41:54
Well if bulls can defend 9k I’ll be happy if we sit around here for awhile.
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:39:56
I’m up 7x on a few... sooooo gotta pick the ones that have great shilling potential and a use case. Doesn’t mean they aren’t shit coin, but I’ll ride my coins to the fucking moon.
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:27:25
Let me pull out my crystal ball.
@_date: 2019-06-14 17:13:05
Half past moon
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:28:08
Looking like we are going to pull back... I want to see that 10k so BADLY
Edit: there was the pull back.. lets see if the bulls come back swinging.
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:28:34
Just like the fight to 9k, we will it’ll take time getting through all those asshole sell orders
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:09:16
Bitcoin won't get me that 1000x
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:42:55
Yup... hahahaha has
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:03:53
My brain hurts
@_date: 2019-12-02 05:41:16
Honestly though
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:07:46
Should have put it in LTC fam..
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:05:36
You are smart, I’d cash out enough to have my bills covered for a good few years. Then just work whatever hours I feel like
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:43:08
How are you disconnected if you posted this post? Pfffft. Going outside, what is that shit anyways?
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:54:13
@_date: 2019-06-29 05:06:37
I mean it still could, not saying it will happen though.
@_date: 2019-06-19 10:46:43
DING DING DING, facebook will make money off of their data...
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:58:26
Yup taking note of this for next time, going to avoid getting caught up in the euphoria..
@_date: 2019-06-18 18:33:01
Not hating but what kind of stance is this? Lol
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:42:19
Let me know if I left out any details
@_date: 2019-06-02 10:10:54
I hope you are joking lol

It’s be funny to keep sinking until 2021 and then moon lambo late 2021zz
@_date: 2019-06-18 19:16:35
not really, just because you have a bitcoin sticker doesn't mean you are a bitcoin millionaire lol
Edit: also just driving a sports car brings all kinds of attention to yourself anyways
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:44:17
Currently jizzing in my pants. For once I get to relax while everyone flips out trying to get money into the market. Thank fucking god I have been buying for awhile now because FOMO would have been EATING ME ALIVE... now I can kick back and watch what happens.
@_date: 2019-12-16 12:02:32
Honestly... I kind of seeing this happening... BTC will moon when most have given up..
@_date: 2019-12-18 12:59:06
@_date: 2019-12-07 23:45:36
Okay?? Lol
@_date: 2019-12-16 12:09:13
Ha.... haha... heh..
@_date: 2019-12-05 23:16:06
Best not to talk about it and let everyone know how much you have
@_date: 2019-12-01 00:17:50
You’d be surprised
@_date: 2019-12-10 21:42:26
I think the person has money to waste
@_date: 2019-06-14 17:12:18
Are you serious?
@_date: 2019-06-04 23:05:20
It’s just the Chinese New Years, it’ll go back up I promise(-50%) Wall Street bonuses coming it’ll pamp back up(-75). Hodl, lambos 2020 halving. ��
@_date: 2019-12-16 12:47:36
The fact so many anticipate a climb leaves me to believe it won’t
@_date: 2019-12-29 20:52:45
Bitcoin to 300 million
@_date: 2019-12-16 12:08:31
Download coinbase 
@_date: 2019-04-01 18:02:52
Honestly, those people are quiet because they are out piping bitches and buying lambos. I know my ass wouldn’t be on this reddit page when I got fuck you money.  If you guys want to be a dumbass and get E-bragging rights for having some BTC,go for it. Just know that it will do nothing for you other than create an unnecessary risk for you which this post is stating. 
@_date: 2019-04-01 17:52:41
Everything in life is an opportunity cost.. 
@_date: 2019-04-01 17:56:54
Yeah I’m actually happy I never bought any back then because selling and seeing it rise to almost 20k would have been so hard to stomach lol.. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 20:27:19
Guys this pumped on none news.. not going to act like I know what is going to happen.. but my instincts point to this pump will be short lived 
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:19:10
I’m sorry this gets a no for me
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:15:43
And in other news, bears shit In the woods
@_date: 2019-01-01 00:28:35
I'm sorry but this aint it chief.
@_date: 2019-01-29 11:46:14
wow, much inspired, much heart strings stroked. 
honestly it's just money at the end of the day, you could sell now and guarantee your profits or take on the risk and hold until a bullrun possibly happens. If your life is all good and you don't need the money, fucking hodl the hell out of it if you believe in a brighter future. I know soon I will be investing again in crypto, need to build my account on Robinhood so I can put money back into crypto and get rich af.
@_date: 2019-01-25 00:35:43
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:16:50
Bitcoin gonna lambo moon soon
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:19:58
Can anyone verify this shit????? If it is real this would be fucking huge... 
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:11:17
I don’t know why... but I’m bothered by you wasting a key sheet for this... 
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:27:30
Lmfao, I’m sorry but this is bs.. not going to even get hype over this
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:14:20
Okay what the fuck are you talking about? BTC was basically dead for 3 years at one point before we saw a recovery and bull market. 
@_date: 2019-09-14 17:50:22
Fair enough
@_date: 2019-09-26 11:16:06
You are correct in this sentiment hodlers are looking at prices just buying when they can and that’s it.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:31:25
@_date: 2019-09-25 01:25:47
WE’RE OVER 9k AGAIN!!!! Omggggg
@_date: 2019-09-19 22:23:41
Just like seeing crypto machines out in public, everyone is like AdoPTion!!!!!! And I’m just thinking, “so another atm”
@_date: 2019-09-14 16:26:20
I figured
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:59:12
@_date: 2019-09-25 10:40:35
The best advice is just don’t play long or short positions with crypto, 9/10 you’ll get your ass handed to you with how manipulated the market is..
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:52:19
Just another day in crypto land tbh
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:31:47
Once btc goes to 20k
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:47:07
@_date: 2019-09-10 18:42:52
Facts, I would have some just Incase money in alts
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:53:43
Mehhh. Just buy small portions weekly and not bat an eye at price fluctuations.
@_date: 2019-09-29 11:41:40
After that back down to 10k party shall be over after that
@_date: 2019-09-14 16:56:39
This is a pretty dope look. Qr code kills it though lol
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:34:35
Hahahahaha ����
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:24:31
Bitcoin is 30 party
@_date: 2019-09-25 10:38:55
I think it’ll happen that BTC halving will be priced in eventually. Late December or January we should see a strong recover and head back towards 20k
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:01:08
That halving will be priced in by at least December or January..
@_date: 2019-09-15 09:42:34
They’ll be at his door soon, no one is going to destroy our coins on my watch. ��
@_date: 2019-09-01 15:38:38
I’m honestly glad I dropped alts awhile ago, tempted to jump back into the game though. I’ll keep saying that until I miss the boat again ��
@_date: 2019-09-20 08:29:19
Exactly, I never understood the excitement. It was cool at first, but now if anything mentions crypto people lose their shit!
@_date: 2019-09-24 06:26:44
I wish people would stop getting excited about this lol
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:02:49
Oh word, xD
@_date: 2019-09-26 11:05:50
This could be it for bitcoin fam
@_date: 2019-09-05 01:01:05
Why only 100? Why not 10000000000000 times?
@_date: 2019-09-14 16:17:40
Isn’t this illegal?
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:46:52
A lot of people buying 10k+ aren’t lol. I’m still on the sidelines.. going to start buying after the first week of October on a weekly bases. Time to start hodling
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:34:07
That bitcoin has no use?
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:00:37
These fluctuations are a blimp in the grand scheme of things...
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:18:39
This was the hardest shit ever to read. Jesus Christ, took me almost 5 minutes
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:37:47
More like 2k ��
*edit: /s, forgot conveying sarcasm over text doesn’t go well
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:04:01
Wait whattttttttt?? And you can withdraw funds to other wallets?
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:12:53
@_date: 2019-05-17 11:28:37
Soooo when whales splash in the oceans just ride the waves. Anyone can make or lose money in the market whales or not.
@_date: 2019-05-19 01:31:55
I wouldn’t change the place I’m located at and instantly upgrade my lifestyle. I would have a DOPEEEEE ass apartment though..and maybe customize my current car as it still works. (Honda cr-z) then cut my hours down at work to maybe 4 hrs a week and plan out what I want to do with the money. After a year of that, then look to changing things up. I’m more excited about the freedom the money will give me than the luxury items I could buy.
@_date: 2019-05-19 01:32:59
I mean yeah partnering with already established businesses working towards the same goal would make more sense. Just depends what his idea is
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:03:47
Honestly kind of looking forward to this lol. SLOT MACHINE BABY!!!!
Edit: only 2x leverage?? Booooooo, I want 100x
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:50:12
He is going to be eating a lot of pizza
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:07:08
Buy and forget is the best thing no point in obsessing over price of crypto. I’ll check it time to time, but I’m accumulating so the fluctuations don’t matter to me.
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:43:54
Do your own research
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:43:02
Earnin app allows me to get paid sooner, check it out
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:40:41
Earnin app would save y’all a lot of headache.
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:18:31
Good I’ll finally have some god damn money in the market. Moving in the middle of all this has been a bitch lol
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:16:12
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:01:04
Maybe op is trolling, no one has to be that gullible.. :/
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:09:21
6,000 now what are you talking about
@_date: 2019-05-19 04:48:10
Exactly throw a solid chunk in dividends and live off that! Best of luck hopefully your dreams come true!
@_date: 2019-05-19 01:34:51
You don’t owe the world shit, there will always be homeless people, give back but remember that once that money is gone it’s gone unless you are good with money.
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:41:12
Download Earnin app and use that. It’s a bless for situations just like this.
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:42:35
Soon we will be back at that, hodl 
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:58:18
I want 10,000x gains not no 90%
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:00:11
Ehhhh same types of phishing scams for fiat. Sucks he lost his money, but these types of errors are the last thing to be making when dabbling into crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:05:58
Nah more like 20k
@_date: 2019-05-19 01:41:18
It already is a currency dumbass
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:15:03
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:15:01
I literally just used simplex and recieved my funds. Coinbase was having issues with my card, so I decided to eat the fees and use simplex. Anyways Coinbase is good too
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:46:51
this accent is too much to want to listen. This aint it chief
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:52:29
He went bye bye
@_date: 2019-05-17 11:27:02
I believe bitcoin could go up again. Oh look bitcoin went up again, I was right. Follow me I got all the answers. I guessed and was correct, I’ll get everyone lambos
@_date: 2019-05-17 11:29:17
Hopefully only part of it
@_date: 2019-05-19 04:47:12
Fair enough! Sounding like a level headed person
@_date: 2019-05-19 01:38:29
Trolling with the money would be fun
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:13:50
Alt season soon.
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:00:32
Yup, rip to op
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:47:54
Honestly I kind of feel the same way lol.. even though I want a moon bad I need more time to accumulate coins
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:14:06
Pretty cool
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:53:51
First learn about bitcoin, then get a Coinbase account and then dyor.
@_date: 2018-12-20 09:53:35
It already went that low, why weren't you buying then?
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:56:46
I went down 50% and back to break even already. Hodl my moon boyssssss
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:49:07
taking a permanent nap 
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:55:53
You still got his point.. lol
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:05:43
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:59:28
Lamb is
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:58:40
Why the fuck would they decide to throw their money in btc because of that shit? Sounds like the whole Chinese New Years bullshit lol
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:54:42
My short on AMD, just got pwned, holding through the 28th.. market better go south with the current interest rate hike. Will see how things play out. Also yay BTC is at 4k now, please give me 6 months before moon plzzzzz
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:43:11
I mean yeah, Bart pattern Dun rekt everybody.
@_date: 2019-05-19 01:35:57
Yah, I’m for sure cashing into fiat. Crypto is too volatile maybe when it stabilizes
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:58:02
This is a thing? Whatttt
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:43:27
You don't own any coins, just the value of bitcoin that's it.
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:17:07
Well don’t anticipate dips just buy them when the opportunity arises
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:49:53
What about every hundred it goes down?
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:18:45
We pass 10k FOMO will be unreal
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:36:21
Yes we should all be in the unregulated market where there are no rules.
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:10:06
When alt season
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:21:29
Yes I was lol
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:12:24
Every man for himself
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:48:50
6,800 now woooo wooo
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:20:03
You must be the god that can see the future. Yeah there will be pull backs and there will be brutal pull backs most likely. But if you are bullish long run then these pull backs are nothing
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:42:25
Earnin app allows you to give yourself a cash advance with zero interest. Used that today to get some other shit I’ve been wanting. But it could be useful for crypto too
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:19:02
I cheer on a sell off
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:47:29
had 100k of these earlier, sold them all last bullrun. may buy back in though.
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:13:55
Mine is sitting locked in a locked fire proof safe. Only touch for transferring crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:57:39
Number one thing is don’t think that crypto currency will make you an instant millionaire. You also should be able to stomach violent swings up and down. Consider all money a loss that you put in, it’ll make this experience a lot easier.
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:56:02
Hopefully it goes through, if it gets rejected.. well it will just be funny to see how the market reacts
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:59:42
You must be new here
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:17:01
I’m fucking glad I stopped using that site. Having money on there would be torture as prices fluctuates
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:17:20
There were still a lot of stories where people were up like 300k and didn’t sell.
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:56:55
Dank, getting hard to hodl nowadays lol
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:41:59
that will be worth a billion dollars one day
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:52:55
It could, but it could also rob you of everything.
@_date: 2018-12-21 05:17:31
Got 10 bolivar for you :)
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:12:43
Supply and demand, just like all things that have”value”
@_date: 2019-05-19 01:38:08
If I could get the low end I’d be happy. Thank god I couldn’t give a fuck about luxury items. I’d have a couple toys here and there, the biggest luxury I’ll have is my time being freed up to do whatever.
@_date: 2018-12-21 14:10:29
I'm sorry massah, i's can't read. :/
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:55:17
Lol, bro, stop trying to tell people what to do with their money
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:57:46
Trying sooooooooo fucking hard to not get fomo. We are due for a correction. But fuck this is hard to watch lol
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:11:56
Yeah nothing wrong with realizing gains, especially with some alts up 40-60% sheesh, people only want 10,000% gains I guess
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:56:20
I thought it was china fud
@_date: 2018-12-25 16:10:31
I feel bad because I'm cheering on the market failure so I can pay my car off quicker. shorting has never been so easy, and the gains from it are absolutely amazing!
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:06:28
I wouldn’t say not a chance lol, seems out of reach but if we keep climbing like we have been it’s not exactly out of the question haha
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:54:05
Then lost all da moneyz....
@_date: 2018-12-19 04:10:09
Exactly, not catching any fomo right now.  Hopefully it stays in this range for awhile. Got so much i want to buy
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:14:28
Just buy and hold dude
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:05:51
The new prophet.. 
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:08:42
Wish people would understand that in the grand scheme of things these fluctuations are anything right now. Wait until the bull market takes full swing after 10k..
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:56:47
Nope, i don't want btc to moon anytime soon. I still have much accumulation left to do.
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:48:21
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:30:07
Fucking facts, people that hung around all the way to 3k are starting to believe again. Over 20k is when FOMO buying will happen. People will just assume it’ll crash again until it surpasses 20k
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:11:40
Jesus christ that is a shizz ton of BTC he bought... Dude flexing hard, and probably shouldn't have posted this publicly. However no shade thrown, if you got the money, fuck it.  
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:55:13
We will be so rich that it'll mean we are rich. 
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:16:31
Exactly, people won’t start watching and caring until we crack 10k then FOMO will kick into high gear. These pumps are people who have been following for awhile buying back in. Mainstream isn’t even thinking about it
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:10:45
Run roh
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:37:13
Thanks upbeat, you get it. I'll go long when it's time to go long. :)
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:00:40
You act like btc went to 20k. Best to buy during reversal anyways
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:01:22
Have my put options set, lets fucking goooooooi
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:07:59
It was really scary but back then. Easier to stomach buying on an uptrend
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:53:07
2 dollah
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:35:48
LMFAO, Crypto is super manipulated right now fuck do you mean??
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:22:25
Jerking it to all them future gains
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:05:20
Idk man at this rate we may see astronomical numbers
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:34:01
You are correct. Bitcoin breaking 10k will spark interest, but people will assume it’ll go back down. Then it breaking 20k FOMO will erupt and everyone will try to jump on the train.
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:41:41
TOO THE MOON, WHERE MY LAMBO BOIISSS AT????
@_date: 2018-12-20 09:52:22
WHERE MY MOON BOYS AT?????? 
Honestly happy we cracked 4k, hopefully we don't go parabolic yet, i still have shit I'm tryna buy..  hopefully 4k is new support though
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:14:46
I didn’t keep scrolling at first and I though it was a bunch of trees
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:22:49
for now.. I'm hoping we still have a little while before bull market... :\\
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:59:08
"Daddy why aren't you rich now?"
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:11:06
Can’t get those gains in the casino
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:27:46
I was actually planning on buying today, but my insurance changed my auto payment to the 18th when it was the 28th.. ughhh.. well at least I'll be able to buy next week. Working a bunch of OT just to make sure I can cop some more of the low cop alts I have been buying up. not afraid of btc going parabolic, just wish I was still buying at the lower prices BTC was at just a week or so ago..
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:57:38
This is comedy, I needed the laugh
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:12:33
Because it’s obvious it’ll most likely not happen until A higher price. Have fun selling early
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:52:09
Better not look at the charts! Lol
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:01:53
It’s easy to hold with money you don’t care to lose. Makes these hectic runs a lot less stressful. Now being up a shit ton of money and holding through, that’ll be interesting
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:59:11
Lesson learned
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:56:06
Sitting here thinking,” WHY ISN’T it Thursday yet?????” Ughhh.. have fun y’all I’ll catch the next bus ;(
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:52:30
That image will forever be stuck in my nightmares.. wtf.... ��
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:53:37
What if you are a perma bull? :/
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:50:54
Bitcoin is no longer a thing
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:25:58
Get out of here
@_date: 2018-12-21 05:14:58

I got my car for 5k, still a nice car that is reliable. Also those people don't have to suffer, just take note that the market is in a decline and adjust their portfolios accordingly. I was doing small put options but I'm about to take on some bigger shorts depending how tomorrow plays out. I'm expecting a huge sell off with the cluster fuck we have in the government atm... Feel bad for those who will suffer from this shit, but I'm not the one controlling the market, just going with the flow.

MUCH WOW, omgggg we are almost to 20k now...   Kind of getting the fomo itch in the back of my mind, but I need to be responsible and also keep my emotions in check.
