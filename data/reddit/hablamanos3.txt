Lol, please stop with stuff like this

IBM is probably desperate for attention and willing to say anything to get some media stories rolling. they have not been doing well lately.

he is probably talking about the rally from 200 to 500 in 2015
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:19:17
If it was tether pushing the price up then the bitfinex price should have led the rallies, not gdax.

I agree that if we have a symbol for a Satoshi, this S thing should be it. The kids in my elementary school were far beyond their time

Mark has been vocal about not wanting any of the BTC at all and that they should all be given to customers.
Stay far away from Brock

It's not going to $100 million per coin without some crazy hyperinflation
@_date: 2019-03-05 05:29:09
You can convert the dollar value at loss into bitcoins...
Ie you get $600 worth of bitcoins for each BTC you are awarded (which would would already be cut based on the lost coins)
The only reason Brock is screwing with this is for personal gain
@_date: 2019-03-05 05:31:33

Whether or not tether is good, it is great to allow people a choice.
@_date: 2018-06-14 13:31:42
even within crypto everyones opinions seem very orthogonal
@_date: 2018-06-30 06:30:22

@_date: 2019-02-13 22:23:40
No, you would make about 6x the profit in any circumstances if you spent the same $ amount today as you would have at $20k
@_date: 2019-02-07 23:46:47
That is non-issue that should not be "solved" by stealing coins that you think are lost.
@_date: 2019-02-05 05:53:50
Could have been part of the sell off from $6k

agreed, but this applies to really any asset. How many people buy apple or tesla or amazon on little more than a whim? The same psychology and patterns of human behavior manifest themselves in all markets.

I wish you could send tips to people before they had an account that would really help.
@_date: 2019-02-16 09:36:37
No, but I traded virtual game items.
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:55:09
That would be pointless. There is no need to bring lost coins back into circulation.
@_date: 2019-02-15 04:43:18
Yep, I would probably move.
@_date: 2019-02-10 20:58:00
They charge a pretty big "spread" though
@_date: 2019-02-23 16:33:43
not everyone was thinking it would hit $100k last year.

He lost the money in a different tax year. He should have taken profits out in December to pay taxes.

I think I saw it within an hour of researching bitcoin

Just waiting for bitcoin options for accredited investors... Only one available to US traders now requires $10 million net worth :(
Could be like 5-10 percent monthly profits selling covered calls just from the implied volatility.
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:41:45
There are also people who made over $1 million, sold around the top, and would buy again when the time is right. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 23:44:12
With regards to what you are talking about... you are fine, just report the purchase price and sale price.
HOWEVER.... You may technically be running an "unliscensed money transmitter business" and doing this at large enough scale can land you in a lot of trouble. I would stop doing it.
@_date: 2019-01-19 23:11:21
This would be ridiculous and is unnecessary
@_date: 2018-11-05 02:20:37
Well thank God she didnt get in.
@_date: 2018-11-29 23:47:47
Were you selling the bitcoins to someone? Did they do anything suspicious?
@_date: 2018-02-24 00:51:56
did you receive it as an email or did you have to log in to coinbase to see it?
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:29:30
just fyi, you can be prosecuted for not having a money transmitter license if you do this too much.
I know someone who paid upwards of a quarter million dollars fighting legal fees because somebody who he sold bitcoins to used them to buy drugs
@_date: 2018-02-10 04:57:28
lol this is pretty funny
glad i could only make it half way through his movie
no time frame for his "close to $0" prediction

I have done so much trading that my testosterone levels must be at the "sex-God" stage.

and its not like a tether implosion would help bcash
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:30:49
Probably only because he knows other people do it.

you got me until....
@_date: 2018-02-26 02:39:41
i hope it's plated in gold... damn
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:06:26
i think we should test this hypothesis

Sounds right... Their logo is a man stepping on a bitcoin. Not very nice
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:46:18
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:58:37
Are you sure this isnt just an exchange moving coins around?
@_date: 2018-02-28 03:28:59
Okay,  i thought for sure i would be on this list but didn't receive an email. So i guess i will assume i'm not for now
@_date: 2018-03-07 06:31:30
probably more like $6 million/$500k income for a household to be in the top 1%
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:01:07
Can you withdraw anything at all? I didn't think you needed verification for $2k per day (but maybe im wrong)
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:57:03
Eventually the new investors will learn?
@_date: 2018-07-22 19:04:38
It's post like these that make me realize I can never ever go on 4chan
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:06:16
Why would the other people trading millions worth keep falling for this?
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:42:31
just read this:
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:32:30
so you have a money transmitter license... why is it so bad to give them your ID? I wouldn't try to go around it.
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:04:48
bitfinex with frozen bank accounts is actually a bullish thing... upon hearing this news do you sell your coins and hold fiat or do you use the fiat to buy coins and withdraw from the exchange?
think of it as fiat on the exchange being devalued
@_date: 2018-04-21 01:29:30
at the rate your going you'll be somewhere around $0 somewhere around part 40
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:38:23
"defied all odds"
@_date: 2018-04-08 15:37:22
awesome! The only other coins i sort of like are ethereum, litecoin, and monero. Perhaps OMG and Nano as well but i need to do more research into those. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:39:44
let us know when you sell
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:28:11
If you do too much you can end up in serious trouble for running an unlicensed money transmitter business
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:37:04
Imagine you receive $100 in bitcoin. one year from now it is worth $150.
The $100 is normal income as if you had received $100 in cash. Then, when you sell the bitcoin for cash, you pay long term capital gains on the $50.
@_date: 2018-12-23 05:04:20
 would HIGHLY recommend to not use this exchange, trust the OP, or other seemingly convincing posts in this thread. Looks like a scam to me.
The website was created only 18 days ago and follows a template of other known scams
@_date: 2018-12-23 05:15:20
as much as arbitrage is real and works sometimes, this site is almost certainly a scam. Don't believe everything you read on the internet
I also suspect that this is a hacked account from the OP as you have not posted in a single crypto subreddit in at least a year.
@_date: 2018-12-23 05:05:26
except that this is ~~probably~~ a scam
@_date: 2018-12-05 01:13:45
Even assuming you are correct, "mining is no longer profitable" is not an argument to prove your point. Hashrate adjusts as it always has until it reaches a new equilibrium. These fluctuations do not largelt affect the average person.
@_date: 2018-12-01 05:07:09
its more like it goes up for a year and a lot of people will think it will keep going up. Then it goes down for a year and a lot of people think it will keep going down.
@_date: 2018-12-30 19:16:14
they need a new person to manage their crypto -\_-
it was a very stupid bet when it was made, especially for a fund with only $130m AUM
They say it was a way to "risk a little to win a lot", but the EV was definitely not on their side.
@_date: 2018-12-23 05:05:10
this is almost certainly a scam
@_date: 2018-12-23 05:05:50
this exchange he is advertising is likely a scam
@_date: 2018-12-25 08:52:05
Fortunately btc is not worth $0

Really great work and one of the smartest people in the crypto industry.
@_date: 2018-12-23 04:42:53
That is irrelevant if your net worth is close to $0 and you owe $400k in taxes now. Yes, you can use your $1 million in losses to deduct $3k per year for the next 333 years and $1k in the 334th year.

Gox got hacked in 2011, right around the price peak.
@_date: 2018-12-23 05:11:03
The website was created only 18 days ago and follows a template of other known scams. All he did was find a recent large-ish bitcoin transaction to link to and type the number into his scam site.
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:49:14
Merry Christmas! 
@_date: 2018-12-22 06:05:44
I see nothing in that article that disputes what I said.
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:12:30
I'm not anticipating having to panic any time soon over hashrate fluctuations. So I don't think about it.
@_date: 2018-12-21 23:50:17
But if you make $1 million in December (and realize it) and lose it all in January, you will owe taxes on the $1 million in gains from the previous year.
@_date: 2018-12-23 05:19:03
The "angle" is that when you "sell" them your coins, you never get paid. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 23:39:49
That is incorrect. In a rising market there can be more winners than losers.
