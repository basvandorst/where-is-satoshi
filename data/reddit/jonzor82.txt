I dunno, but hasn't the internets proven that Nokia's can stop bullets?  Which one would you rather have closer to your heart? ;)

[just right](

The biggest thing that impresses me about this site (being new to it), is the fact that I had no issue connecting my USAA account with them.  I've been having issues with Gemini and GDAX, but Robinhood got me straight in only a couple minutes.

I'm waiting for the value to tank, just like every other time I buy in.  The cycle must continue!
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:36:30
Hodl?  Shit, I bought up another $100 worth

People say only buy what you can lose.  That's what I did.

Is there any reason to be leery of investing?  The price is rising at an awfully FAST rate, but I'm fearful of a crash.  What's causing it to skyrocket SO FUCKING HARD!

GUYS!  I FOUND ONE!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:35:28
Agreed.  I was caught offguard when my phone app updated, and now i dont see BCH anymore.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:38:31
Holy shit you're right.  I invested when it was around $10, and pulled when it went up to $20 because i needed the money.  Wtf?
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:22:57
Is it treated like a commodity because the value of it fluctuates so much so quickly?  It was only a couple weeks ago when it floated above $1200/btc, but this morning it's dropped below $1000/btc and still going.
It's really difficult to keep money invested in the currency when there's so much that could be lost so easily (at least when you're a small timer like myself).  I've used BTC for purchasing before, and I really enjoy the idea, but when the fluctuations become less wild and more stable is when i'll feel more comfortable using it more frequently for purchasing.

You have a typo, you mean $10k, right?
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:30:20
Hope it turns back up after buying another $100!

Unrelated, but i appreciate your username
@_date: 2019-12-17 16:22:23
So this helps explains the dip?
@_date: 2017-04-17 22:30:50
Shit. I thought you were referencing somebody other than yourself for a second there.  Goosebumps for a second.

That link led me to [this glorious piece](  I believe my day has been made.

I just submitted a purchase for $20 worth of BTC through coinbase this morning when it was around $840.
I'm not sure if I should be excited or not...
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:06:02
I've been watching the charts at CoinBase.  It's risen at least $5 in the last 2 hours.
@_date: 2013-11-13 13:53:59
It feels almost useless to invest in these now.
