I was fully registered, they had photos of me, passport, etc, addresses, two bank accounts. Im a front end seller to a European market and I am totally within the law. Bashing it about with friends, Id say it was just the numbers. Over 3 years it was quite high. One day they just knocked me out. Now Im using Kraken for the same. Was a bit pissed off, I like bitstamp. The black box of banking I fear was working in the background.

While I would agree in general, this same thing could have been said about NSA spying, CIA government overthrows etc etc.
Think of this line: What is simpler, that you have paranoid delusions or that all your internet connected electronics are being spied on by a shadow group consisting of colluding parts of international government headed by the USA. 
And yet we know which one is true.

Ah yea, i can see I made a comment 4 days ago in bitcoin. That must be it. The account is only 5 days old though so I was surprised it was caught up so quickly
@_date: 2016-01-27 08:27:55
Yes, and I have a new account. No subscriptions even. How are they getting peoples names?

You have taken that out of context. He is referencing the deeper cypher-punk movement. i.e.
