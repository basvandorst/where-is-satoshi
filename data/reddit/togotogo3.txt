I have drawn a line from it's all time high (ATH) at $1200 to it's current level. That's my trend for the future. Till now it predicts pretty accurate the current price and what is coming.
@_date: 2016-08-18 18:23:35
it's over
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:36:14
Bitcoin had it's peak at 1200$. Those who cashed at that level are the true winners. Will never happen again for this coin. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 09:41:51
The biggest proof that price is independent of trading volume. Something we did already know because when price was 1200/bitcoin, trading volume was nearly zero 
@_date: 2016-08-25 16:53:00
Never thought this would be bearish for the price. You would expect the opposite.

How many times has bitcoin declared dead? That's the similarly with the mentioned mobile banking project. In my opinion most people do not care (and understand)  what (the history of)  money is and power and abuse.  As long as they can fuck and are able to make debs and live in peace this will be the case. It is going on for centuries and will not change soon. No matter how great bitcoin is (which it is in my humble opinion)

It's not only Coinbase. No one can be trusted. Only thing you can do is accumulate bit by bit and hope someday you wake up with a ten fold price. And even then I would not swap it full back in fiat again but spend it gently to your basic needs. That's my view on trust and people slash companies. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:28:28
If all those investors could buy real coins the price would have been over $1000/bitcoin already. So sad big investors are not allowed to buy real coins directly from market. Plus the fact that buying real coins is much easier to verify the qualities bought and hold in cold storage. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 17:06:58
Looks bearish to me to be honest. Maybe because I see it from it's top of 1200. Most people seems to have forgotten that. Peeps forget easy.

@_date: 2016-06-18 02:03:59
True, but price of bitcoin can only rise when supply decreases due buying real coins. Investing in surrogates does not effect it's price. If it is true that 1gtbc contract equals 0.1 real btc, the Bitcoin price would have been affected more by buying Gtbc and there was not such a difference ($1500 vs $750).

Funny. The article mentions a confirmation time for the blockchain.info wallet for over 17 minutes. 
I use this blockchain.info wallet DAILY the past three years now for ordering delivery meals (default transaction fee, order amount within 0.03 - 0.05 BTC on average) and this first confirmation is always within 10 minutes. Second one usually couple minutes later. Maybe it's country specific (i'm ordening from Holland)?
@_date: 2016-02-14 10:15:33
You sound like a soiled child. If I listen to you i would have switched to other coins long time ago. Let me tell you this. I buying AND spending bitcoins nearly EVERY day (since it was single digits). I never had ANY trouble with waiting or what kind of trouble. It always confirmed with 10 minutes. And using services like BitPay, let you instant do the transaction. The other party don't even know you using coins.
It's all such a waste of time. The whole discussion. Better to wait till a more permanent solution is found. If you don't have patience, go on, be my guest, and buy some cool aid alt coins

if bitcoin dies. the group of increasing the size of the blocks, is for a very great part responsible for it.
The risk for centralisation is too big, that governments or large group of data centers can attack bitcoin due a bigger blocksize.

Ranging just between $50 and $100 is a good price. It takes some time but eventually we got there. Part of the current trend.

I have several brainwallets since 2011. Never have any hacks. Never forgotten anything. You can share the passphase if you really want with anyone you trust or love in case you die. If there is no one you trust so what when you die and coins are lost. In fact that is good for Bitcoin. Strange all those downvotes. Good luck. 
@_date: 2016-09-08 10:06:41
Tip for all: Keep your stash in a brainwallet and do not share it with anyone (or only those you trust). You do not need it to store anywhere.

If really one million people purchase only "one" bitcoin price would be much higher than it is today [limited supply is currently aprox 15M].

I just setup a lightning node (autopilot setting). After a while [LNBIG.com]( opened 6 channels. My wallet balance went down from 0.03498291 BTC to 0.01395977.
I closed the channels got the message:
 Unilaterally close channel with node and channel point  The closing transaction will need 1081 confirmations before the funds can be spent. (yes/no): yes
The channels are closed but after a while 6 new channels opened by [LNBIG.com](
My wallet balance is now reduced to 0.0053054 BTC.
Is [LNBIG.com]( a scam site ? Anyone else?
@_date: 2019-01-17 10:39:35
I get it now. Due to Autopilot the remaining funds are spendable and found in channelbalance! No scam! [
Very good read!

Bitcoin wannabees who missed the train want to start with Altcoins. Those people laughed in the beginning at the Bitcoin early adapters. That is my experience. I keep it with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-10-11 09:49:41
Market of gold is also small compared to the fiat markets. Still gold is valuable. Big market share does not mean big price. Only thing bitcoin needs it keeps itself. That is security above all
@_date: 2016-10-11 07:00:50
Bitcoin is up because bitcoin survived the big blocksize devils  which would have  destroyed bitcoin.  Still this is a threat. See en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_size_limit_controversy

First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you pay taxes and give them your Bitcoin. Sad but true. 
@_date: 2016-05-22 11:00:06
Bitcoin does not need a face. It needs to stay as much as it was when released by Satoshi. If you want something different pick an alt. Good luck with writing such long stories. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 06:40:29
With or without the news. The real Satoshi could sell anytime IF he is alive. If selling occurs it's the buying opportunity of your life

No proof. Congratulations you made a headline

You don't have to memorize the keys. I think this was part of the plan to secure the first coins. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 15:26:11
You do not understand. Nowadays they tax you of your property in Euro's. If all transactions takes place in Bitcoin they tax you in Bitcoin. In the Netherlands they tax you 60% of your value of your property EVERY YEAR. So in less then two years the government have all your property. Welcome into the new world order.
@_date: 2016-05-06 21:04:57
Maybe the primary keys are locked in the trust. After some time they can be released. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 12:21:21
If this was the case bitcoin would not decline. As we all can see this is not the case atm

All unspent addresses  are hashed by default. 
@_date: 2016-05-11 06:36:58
Bad thing. How would you react if some petition wants to block your retirement . Only Satoshi decides what he does with the coins. If he wants to spend them he spends. If he wants to burn them even better. Again it's in his hands. 
@_date: 2016-07-23 06:15:47
Now what does that tell you how people really are? And why there is bitcoin? Personally I never would have used an iPhone (read all the stories about Apple and bitcoin l and I would never use an exchange to store my own coins (this is not being your own ban,which is bitcoin all about l. Try using android with any bitcoin app. I never have any experienced this. Good luck.

You have to have patience. And that means it can happen in a couple of generations. That's the risk. It's not a be fast rich scheme. It took nearly 2000 years before gold had its current level. So very long term it's bullish. Again patience is the key. 
@_date: 2016-05-11 08:10:39
Something that is hashed is invulnerable for quantum hacking. No worries. Bitcoin is prepared on that

I agree on that too. It is nearly unimaginable what the price will be when more regular people buying bitcoin too with such limited fixed supply. That was one of the reasons I bought my stack when price was single digits. Exciting times for us as bitcoin holders  ;)
