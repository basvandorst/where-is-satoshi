 * Pools could start completely ignoring transactions with no fee, or with a fee that's too low. Unless I'm missing something - is there anything in the system that forces miners not to deliberately ignore transactions?

I agree. The real bubble is not going to hit until you can buy bitcoins with credit cards and paypal, without using sketchy sites that have already been hacked, and without sending a picture of your driver's license. Right now buying BTC is still too difficult for the mainstream.

Or the simplest solution, just email your friends at the moment when you think of the prediction. :)  If you don't want to reveal your prediction at the time, then some simple encryption will suffice.
Using the blockchain is just a variation of that, except you are emailing all the miners instead of emailing your friends directly, and taking advantage of the fact that the blockchain is public knowledge.

If Bitcoin becomes untrustworthy then the whole currency will be devalued and everyone will lose. So yes, someone willing to spend enough resources could make this attack, but it would be a losing game for them too.

One thing that bugs me is how the media (and many devs) constantly say "there is no central authority". As long as there is a core dev team that can modify the software and issue global alerts, there is a central authority.

That is true, NIGGATRON666. Of course it's the same story for any exchange, even the ones with regulation/oversight. If everyone in the US decided to do a bank run at the same time, they would have to close the banks and tell everyone to fuck themselves.

That's true, for those miners being overpaid it would be good. But that would cost the guild money, so it would be similar to the guild just buying more hardware. The real danger would be if BTCGuild itself could profit from a hostile takeover of Bitcoin.
