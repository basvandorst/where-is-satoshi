Yes, legit. I've ordered a Tea subscription using Bitcoin.
You can even ping the CEO on Twitter if you have more questions.

Very cool. Any plans to support alts?

Yes. I can't imagine MtGox as nothing other than a giant mountain...

It's funny, because they kept my credit card account open. But "real" money accounts are getting shut down. :(

How do you day traders handle the taxable event occuring when you sell from btc&gt;fiat. You may be up bitcoin, but owe taxes on the gain, no?

I sent them a message on Twitter.
Their [reply]( is that the Rolling Jubilee fund is closing at the end of 2013 and they have no plans for adding a new donation mechanism. :(

I like it. One suggestion is to modify the B and manually adjust it so it is vertically balanced. Possibly adding a slightly heavier weighting may work too.
And then for the tag line play with putting all on one line. If that doesn't look good visually then you could shrink the main "Bitcoin" title.

Wow. I've been a customer for &gt;7 years. And I am very disappointed. Think it's time to move.

Tell him one random guy from the internet would seek him out next time he's home in Hawaii and buy a round of sandwiches!

Same here. They've made selling back into USD fiat. I can't believe how quickly they are releasing features too. I'm bullish on them, but don't know much about their organization.
