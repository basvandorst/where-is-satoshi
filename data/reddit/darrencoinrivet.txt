Afraid it will be some time before we can get the wider public to accept crypto as something other than a dark force.

Looks like a good story here somewhere.

It is interesting to observe the curious market apathy that seems to be around Bitcoin at the moment. I suspect a lot of people are becoming wise to obvious manipulation that can govern the price, and they're understanding that volatility is simply the nature of the beast.
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:46:12
This would make a great story. Drop me a line.
@_date: 2019-07-23 22:25:05
Best post of the day. You win Reddit!

Almost time to shore up with the chocolate HobNobs!

Still is. It's where we interviewed him.
@_date: 2019-03-29 09:21:00
Why what?
@_date: 2019-03-27 07:03:58
Totally understand. It does sound like a terrible pre-order ad, but I couldn't think of a better way of putting it. Having seen the raw footage, I promise we'll deliver, and you certainly won't be disappointed.
@_date: 2019-03-27 00:15:20
In good time. It only got filmed a couple of hours ago in our studio. The guys need to edit the footage etc first. We probably won't publish until Monday, but there's no harm in a heads-up, right?
@_date: 2019-03-30 08:26:23
How's that "Hoax - there is no interview" comment working out for you?
@_date: 2019-03-26 23:54:07
I realise how it might look, but I'm not entirely sure how better to give people a heads-up on something that looks like a terrific interview.
@_date: 2019-03-27 09:26:54
Bless you. Now, run along for now, but don't forget to come back and apologise when we post the interview in a few days once the production guys have finished the edit.
@_date: 2019-03-30 00:35:23
Are you not entertained?
@_date: 2019-03-27 10:31:25
Afraid it'll take a few days with the production crew, as it was a video link interview into the studio.
If we posted the raw footage, you wouldn't hear the sound sync properly, as I was rigged up to a radio mic.
It's such a good interview that it deserves quality production.
@_date: 2019-03-28 14:24:12
Me or John McAfee? Ha ha.

Not suggesting a fraud has been committed here, but I would like to talk to German Neff.
@_date: 2019-08-14 18:05:17
Let me know if you're better at it - I'm looking for good columnists.
@_date: 2019-08-15 14:36:04
And an interesting two cents.
I have to say, all things you mention above do get covered in our Express articles - we write four or five for the Express each week so each of those subjects get their time in the spotlight.
The problem we would have in including everything you mention there is that a 300-word article would simply not contain it. To properly explain the points you've listed would require a 2,500-word feature... and that's not the requirement in this case.
Oddly enough, the short technical pieces are well read but the deeper, long-read explanations are not. That's why we save the deeper stuff for Coin Rivet.

It really isn't.
@_date: 2019-06-06 12:30:50
I really don't.
And you know you can't wipe your backside on a website, right?
@_date: 2019-02-12 10:36:09
An interesting observation from academic Gavin Brown explains how that viability differs across the world...
@_date: 2019-06-06 16:49:53
His position as a former chief within the SEC means his viewpoint is newsworthy, whether you agree with it or not.
Imagine not agreeing with the views of a dictator in a country where they controlled the news. By not publishing those views, you are then creating the very same censorship that you argue against.
My role is to ensure the views of the crypto and blockchain space are reported fairly, accurately and in a balanced manner. I don't always agree with what is being said or indeed like the people saying it, but I would certainly never allow that to shape the way we present the news.
@_date: 2019-06-06 17:03:37
If you didn't understand from the previous explanation, you're not going to understand at all.
@_date: 2019-02-11 23:21:11
I wouldn't say "everybody", but it's a good observation on market psychology.
@_date: 2019-02-05 15:06:38
It's a valid viewpoint, and the basis of an interesting article for the future.
@_date: 2019-06-06 12:19:40
I think that's a valid point. You should make a date in your diary for exactly that.
@_date: 2019-02-05 10:30:45
This is just the sort of artwork we want on the walls of our new office.
@_date: 2019-06-06 09:35:28
I really don't write doom and gloom all the time. I merely write the news as it happens.
Perhaps if you had a better understanding of this you would know you can't possibly wipe your backside on a website.
@_date: 2019-02-12 10:47:05
Interesting how this is being read as both bearish and bullish across the board.
@_date: 2019-04-03 08:47:32
@_date: 2019-09-11 19:07:05
Have you got a better way of presenting whatever point it is you're trying to make?
I'm happy to oblige you.
@_date: 2019-09-11 18:42:04
It really didn't.
@_date: 2019-09-12 08:34:20
@_date: 2018-12-06 12:37:27
You haven't read the article, have you?
@_date: 2019-05-19 06:27:43
Either way, it should be interesting to see how far Bitcoin has come in the eyes of the CBS audience.
@_date: 2018-12-06 11:56:36
Hard to see how an independent journalist working hard to amplify the world of crypto and blockchain can be described as a "shiller". Maybe reading the article before passing a rapid judgement based on pre-conceived ideas could help? [HERE](
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:06:26
Don't know where this idea of FUD or shilling is even coming from. I'm a genuine Bitcoin fan and also the UK's most senior blockchain and crypto journalist.
Some of the curious bile in response to my post makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
@_date: 2019-05-31 14:46:36
This is so good to see.
