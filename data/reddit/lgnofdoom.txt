Amazon is a bit tricky because I have a friend going in for one day, and then coming back out. Amazon does not ship to the country that we are in. Thus, the request for a SHOP in Singapore. Anyone?

"However, from reading the other sub it's pretty clear that their end game is (using their words again) to send BTC into a death spiral."
I do not think that the r/btc sub has an end game. They are bitcoin cash maximalists that want the bitcoin market cap. Bitcoin maximalists want the Bitcoin Cash market cap. Anyone seeking store of value and not exactly certain as to what the proper diversification is, will want as much market cap as can be, right? So, if you thought that BCH was about to death spiral, with BTC absorbing market cap, then would you be content? Competition for store of value coin is not really ideal, IMO.

"Let them know that we are expecting them to try and attack us again but that we have a few little plans in place as well."
Really? Insane crypto money and miscellaneous money is coming in hard, against bitcoin. Are these plans secret, or can you share?

This is apparently why ASIC using big blockers loathe Segwit. If you listen to the world's biggest troll, he always refers to the true Bitcoin as either "Segwit 1x Bitcoin" or "Bitcoin Segwit," whereby he utilizes Segwit as a derogatory term in a similar mannter that we refer to "Bitcoin Cash" as BCash, BTrash, BRash, or BCrash.

What is an indicator that the meme pool is being spammed, for another potential B Cash pump?
When you say 90,000, you are referring to unconfirmed transactions?

Yea, you may be right. But, Roger wants his coin to be store of value. And what Roger wants, I think he will get.
