I'm a little confused here. I admit I am an investment banker himself, who bought and sold bitcoin, but doesn't really see its game changing nature due to it being a speculative commodity like product as opposed to a proper currency.
What exactly are the banks so terrified of?
The only reason you can use bitcoin to buy something, is because the dollar acts as a vehicle currency to determine price setting, not the other way around.
Not a shit post, but what is the great fear here?

It was the middle class fuck nuts. Because of pension holdings. Again the point went so far above your head, NASA is tracking it. Don't move the goal posts each time you numbnuts. 
If you feel currencies will lose values or the system is rigged, buy long dated puts/options on the overvalued exposure.
Hell I will setup a standardised contract with you with a knockout clause meaning you pay upfront and I don't even collect premiums.
**Fuck, JUST for you**, i'll structure it in bitcoin (with my option (discounted) to switch back into Pound Sterling at a 12 month rolling rate).
I might just develop this product to sell bitcoin believers. You a buyer in this market?

Loans are created through the fractional reserve system.... not sure how this relates to anything... Interest income that banks earn through loans is pretty stable in the past few decades (I assume your implying banks simply produce loans from thin air to lend, which is not true)
I mean I get why block chain is a fantastic technical breakthrough, but I mean how does bitcoin not behave like a commodity?
Wouldn't it need inflation and a lender of last resort? Otherwise you would have massive deflation eventually?
Btw banks making a consortium to deal with this is hardly note worthy. I think you like to think bitcoin makes all the banks shake in their boots when in reality the fiat currencies are still the value transmission channel for bitcoin (and will remain so because those currency are backed by some lender with teeth). I myself have representative my bank for regulators for MBS and ABS.
I wasn't shit posting but you seem kinda myopic in your views, a bit self centered to think the big FIs are trying to kill what is in essence a fantastic tech demo for block chain.

No it doesn't... How do you think the countries were bailed out post WW2? How were entities bailed intra-state? You don't even understand what a real lender of last resort entails. Again you don't understand what you are arguing. A lender of last resort fundamentally guarantees a mediums of exchange's continued use. 
Imagine an exogenous shock which destroys 50% of bitcoins in circiulation? then what?
***Honestly you don't understand economics.*** This isn't a snarky dig (though calling me an idiot again and again is fantastic in terms of engagement). You are reading blogs which don't even fully understand the most basic concept of aggregate demand. There is not serious economic research on cyptocurrencies yet, for the same reason I keep saying, it has not lived through a proper interest rate cycle. 


His argument doesn't lead to deflation because he is still pricing something in Dollars. If you cannot CREATE bitcoin to serve more people, it will in the long run be deflationary. As for my "Keynesianism", I studied at LSE and UCL. They taught all schools of economic thought, but the most dominant and stable remains Keynes. Again you are most likely too young to have seen or studied tightening and rising cycles.  Just remember when you make all these arguments that the Fed only raised interest rates after 10 years.


It will survive because it is a great method of making illicit payments and the use of tumblers and other techniques hide transactors. Just like hookers get paid more in dollars than in visa card, bitcoin's anonymity will lead it to survive. Though it never replaces a currency.


Any examples there buddy? Aside from 3 pension funds holding CDOs which lower rung of the financial pyramid is exposed to securitisation risk?


Maybe its because your anger is misplaced. And all our conversation shows that you are infact a young and fervent believer of knew technology and I admire that. But as someone who structures complex financial assets for a living your age and lack of experience in terms of real world impact is showing.


You have both though. Lack of experience and lack of knowledge. All your arguments are not just wrong, but you feel as if the modern economic world has a conspiracy against you. Its the self centered fallacy. Take for example your following point:


How is a central bank targeting full employment and stabilized infaltion central planning? You understand that this shows a complete lack of knowledge to modern market/economic structures? 


These are the EXACT arguments people used to make about gold in the 1900s (and even do today). The great currency devaluations never happened over 2008-2015. The worst affected was the Euro, but mostly because Europe lacks serious demand pickup. This is where your ***AGE/lack of knowledge*** shows. You haven't done the homework to realise the false premises behind your logic.


Yes interest rate policy (something that has been around since the Sumerians, or about 3000 years) is the same as the internet being created. For someone as sarcastic as yourself you see how idiotic the comparison it?
 Honestly man, just say you don't understand the impact, because bitcoin lacks it. If you cannot set a borrowing rate for bitcoin, you cannot make investments...
**TL;DR: You are passionate and young. Good. Calling me stupid repeatedly doesn't really do much, but making fundamentally wrong arguments around economics/markets/policies does make you look at the very least terribly foolish. Your knowledge (euphoric as it maybe) on fundamental concepts needs major work. Last but not least, the "system" that you fear so much that is plotting against you, is filled with remarkably well read and intelligent men and women. They have shown you, at the very least, the pit falls of cyptocurrencies. It would be wise to listen to their doubts. Here is some homework. Solve the lender of last resort fallacy and pick up your nobel prize in economics**

Let's not just skip it because these are the fundamental weaknesses of Bitcoin to serve as currency. Not to mention you can't have interest rate policy with bit coin. I understand that most bitcoin users do not have the true grasp of global economics or currency dynamics, but this stuff is fundamental.
This is essentially why it will never replace fiat currencies (this is not me saying it, its the Bank of England). No one who is a proponent of bitcoin has ever truly addressed those issues.


Why? Why would I keep it on the DL? I am 100% certain you have no true idea of how fundamental to European recovery that asset class is/will remain or how that asset class works or is structured. You know some bad shit happened in 2008, thus all securitisation bad.
Look man you are an enlightened cynic. I get it. It's a great shtick, but fundamentally you do not understand the things that you oppose. 


Case in point. What does the above even mean? Fractional reserve banking is a corner stone of sound monetary policy. It's the reason that despite your (inaccurate) assessment that bankers are "creating loans outta no where" the central bank can simply tighten the reserve requirement and the excess liquidity dries up. Your problem is probably that you are too young to have even lived during a tightening cycle. Where does the house of cards come in?
**TL:DR: Bitcoin was made by nerds to be cool. It fails the lender of last resort/store of value/Interest policy provisions of most modern fiat currencies.**

Then you are a fucking idiot for making your earlier accusation aren't you? That or your lying (i'm gonna go with the second one).


Never said it, just said it was complex, much too complex for you apparently. Because you made first year ECON 101 errors. Doesn't also take away my point because you still are talking about something with confidence when you know very little of it.
Btw Also lawyers don't structure the bonds, bankers do. I work in London, no European ABS defaulted pre or post crisis. Plus I joined post crisis, things have changed, but that won't matter to you because you are the type of guy who watches one pod cast and thinks he can solve the debt crisis.


Then look like bitcoin won't be used in any appreciable manner will it numbnuts?


But you assume I went to private school.... because obviously finance is a gilded profession.
Ok man, look you are like a "euphoric atheist". Your arguments have been destroyed. Your lack of knowledge sorely found out. But you are beyond any reasonable reach. I suspect you will remain so.
I thought I could knock some sense into you. But nope.

There are cheaper ways to bet against RMB, I'd have to take a 3 way exposure to structure that bet. Considering we aren't doing this in the millions, I can't hedge myself. Plus I kinda sorta have a bet against the RMB going anyway, so I'd be going against my own position.
But if you want long dated bet against USD or Sterling I'm here.

....man I'm 28 and I realise why my older colleagues dislike millennials now.
You are too died in the wool dude. Of all the wrong in the above post I leave you to consider these 5 quick points:


Then it is ultimately deflationary. Deflation means real debts become expensive and no one uses bitcoin in any meaningful way.


If it is used more than fiat.... it is the defacto vehicle currency (like the US dollar). If it isn't used like fiat then its just a tech experiment. As long as the value of bitcoin is crystallised through a fiat currency it cannot overtake its use.


Because the market is made of human actors and human actors are not fully rational and do not have perfect information. No system in the world will not have shocks. And again you age is showing, because we have suffered recessions before. And equality was been worse. This is why we have governments to correct those things.


No sir you still haven't fundamentally even begun to understand my questions, but you are certain it has been answered (maybe read some of the books on the system you feel is so terrible). Interest rates are defined across multiple institutions and set daily across the maturity curve, using US gov debt/depository rates as a benchmark (each country uses a slightly diff benchmark) (all interest rates are floating rates, a fixed rate is swapped rate no matter where it occurs on any appreciable scale). If bitcoin is deflationary (and it is defacto since its amount is fixed and bitcoin can be lost, destroyed) then any interest rate policy mechanism will be terrible in its used. If bitcoin takes hold without the preceding, then you have every bitcoin actor setting a personal interest rate. Hence very little to no market clearing at any appreciable size. That is where that tricky lender of resort issue comes in. Do you understand now? Do you understand how little you have thought this through?


Ok listen I'm was trying to be civil, but you must be a fucking numbnut not to understand the bailout was done to ultimately help ordinary people not get completely wiped out by a DEPRESSION. Did it save a shit load of banks? Ofcourse, because saving the banks meant saving consumers ultimately. That was the political calculus. Banks took advantage of that and got favorable terms. That is the bit to be pissed off about. 


I will answer it. I mean you avoided my lender of last resort question (I suspect because as most experts agree bitcoin or any currency is fucked without it) but here we go. Do you know what assets benefited MOST from QE? Treasuries, MBS and ABS.
Do you know who held the **LARGEST QUANTITIES OF THESE AND RELATED ASSETS.**
***Pension funds.*** Thus QE saved your and your parents retirement savings. Bet you didn't know that you jackass.
**TL;DR: if you really are a young guy, then please take an economics course. Economics, despite what people may think, is an exceptionally difficult subject which is not intuitive to figure out. You would not argue about complex topics in mechanical engineering with this level of certainty, yet for some reason you feel your pseudo-wikipedia level of knowledge makes you judge the merits of bitcoin. Just say you like it and move on. Don't sit their making future proscriptions. I'm done here.**
P.S: I went to public school my whole life and volunteered in Afghanistan and Pakistan for extended period of time with the UN / WHO. Us "financial elites" are not a monolith and we don't care enough about screwing other people over.
