It's a nice comment, but there are some errors. 
First of all, yes, without a doubt, bitcoin is a currency right now. The bar is actually rather low for something qualifying as a currency. In prison, cigarettes are a currency. Within a small group of people, there's a common medium of exchange, and this is undoubtedly true of bitcoin. It's a currency, and the group of people which use it is growing. 
Whether or not it's "money" is a different, squishier question, and it depends on where you draw your lines. There is no objective definition for what "is" and "is not" money; so let's not act like there is.
Second, the old man (as much as he's wrong) does bring up good points. He's asking the question: must all blockchain activity in the future require Bitcoin? A valid question, without a clear answer. After all, there are hundreds of competing blockchains as I type this. So, does it necessarily need to be tied to Bitcoin?
Your vigor is appreciated, but let's not go overboard in thinking anyone who disagrees with your beliefs is "retarded or misleading".

The same thing that gives value to anything else: the human mind. Value is an evaluation of something's ability to satisfy our ends. If people believe that Bitcoin can satisfy their ends, it has value.

Thanks, mate. Good idea. I'm thinking of a way to release it free to for the first week or something.

If this works, it will be even more disruptive than Bitcoin. World-changing stuff, potentially.

Sorry man, if you think Newegg's higher brass didn't OK this post, you don't know how the industry works. Official blogs are not formal press releases, but they represent the views of the company. It's a big deal.

Thanks - delicious.

Update: fixed for me.

I am planning on explaining money in the section clearing up common myths.

This has huge potential.

This sure would be an elaborate hoax getting Andy Greenberg and Forbes involved.

Thank you sir

Whoa - not a subtle endorsement at all.
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:17:52
I'd say that it WILL be here to stay - the current amount of Wall Street money in Bitcoin is tiny compared to the potential amount of money. Take one hedge fund - one - and have them drop 1% of their funds into BTC. What happens to the price?
It bitcoin appealing enough to sway one hedge fund to take a tiny gamble on it? I think so (with a potential monster-upside).
I don't think it's a conspiracy though. Wall Street and the establishment in general moves very, very slowly. I mean, two years ago, you could pick up a bitcoin for like ten bucks. Two years feels like an eternity when you're in the market and are checking the price every day. Two years in financial-world is an extremely small amount of time, especially when you're dealing with brand new technology like this. 
I wouldn't risk any more money that you can't afford to lose - but I certainly wouldn't pull out at the bottom. Just take a few hours to look at the previous booms and busts. Your thought process is identical to everybody else's during the bust phase. Pulling out now is identical to pulling out at $2 or $10. How long will the price take to recover? No idea. Might it drop further? No idea. 
But if the fundamentals haven't changed, you've got to trust them.
@_date: 2014-10-04 13:43:45
The time period we're talking about here is teeny-tiny. Study the historical Bitcoin price - the booms and busts. Get a bigger perspective of the Bitcoin trend. Ask yourself, "Has the big money entered into Bitcoin yet?"
For goodness sake, take the USD situation, if you want proof of the market valuing things upside down. It's at nearly an all-time high, and the fundamentals couldn't be worse. But, if you're a smart investor, you play the long run. It's a matter of time before the USD takes a massive, maybe catastrophic hit.

Something tells me the internet couldn't have been created without books. And books without language. And language without brains. 
Well really, nothing will ever be considered disrupting except the Big Bang.

I think he's wrong on a few points: 
@_date: 2014-11-14 19:32:11
Precisely the audience I am aiming for.
@_date: 2014-10-04 13:39:00
Hate to feed the addiction, but considering where the price has been, and considering the positive news coming out recently, $623 seems like a number that can be blown past quickly.
This point in time is precisely when people make money. This is the "buy low" period - you do the opposite of the market if you believe in the fundamentals. I don't think the fundamentals have changed in anything but a positive direction.
@_date: 2014-12-08 02:00:07
Same here
@_date: 2014-10-07 21:27:07
It doesn't seem portable? What's more portable than being able to send BTC to anywhere around the globe instantly?
@_date: 2014-11-14 19:36:06
Sounds great - I'd love to read what you've come up with.
@_date: 2014-11-14 00:12:59
That's my goal, yep. I'm not begging, and I'm not limiting my audience to a Reddit post. Regardless of whether I meet the goal, it's still going to be written.

I thought the same about the investors buying in at the $10 bubble. Same at $200.
Is Bitcoin officially big enough where we shouldn't expect any new waves of enthusiasm? 
Orders of magnitude more people haven't even heard of bitcoin than have. The Bitcoin community is in a very tight (relatively small) tech bubble, and the amount of money sitting on the sidelines dwarfs whatever is currently invested.
@_date: 2014-04-05 01:19:00
In the bigger picture, yes. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 03:51:41
Thank you - that was my goal!
@_date: 2015-01-16 20:10:33
A second wave? You mean a fifth?

OP - I wrote an introductory book on Bitcoin and recently released the free audiobook version on Youtube. The whole thing is less than 2 hours and covers all the bases:

The fork is in regards to the software. It has been forked. The blockchain has yet to be forked.

Agreed. Theymos has misunderstood his role in the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:41:30
Outrageous power trip. The power went to his head. An information authoritarian - the exact opposite of what the entire Bitcoin/technology movement is about.
I am a Bitcoin author, and I have to unsubscribe from this subreddit, and advise anybody else to do the same. We shouldn't refer people to a censored forum. Open source technology is about freedom - this monarch stands for the opposite.
Incredibly disappointing. r/Bitcoin was one of the last few wonderful subreddits, and now it's been ruined like the rest of them, for the same reason.
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:51:41
This doesn't mean there's no reason to have small blocks. Certainly, they have good, legitimate reasons. I think they're wrong, and their authority is disproportionate to the rest of the bitcoin community. 
I don't support disparaging them, but that doesn't mean I'm prevented from saying I think they're wrong.

Bitcoin as a currency is related to news about international currency markets. News like this is directly related. Imagine an article about 20%+ inflation in a domestic economy, and people looking for alternative, non-inflationary currencies.
Wouldn't directly reference "Bitcoin", but it would be very relevant.

Yes, before the hate starts, this is very relevant to Bitcoin. International currency competition deals with breaking up the USD monopoly. The USD has been the world's reserve currency for 70 years, and if people are looking for alternatives, bitcoin will inevitably enter the discussion.
