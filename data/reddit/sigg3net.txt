This is true for me at least. When I realized that my BFL order would be delayed I bought coin for "insurance" but only enough to equal out the estimated cost of HW/freight/vat. (And good thing I did. It was delayed by &gt;1 year.)
But I spent what was reasonable at the time, and coins were already rising in value, while knowing that they previously was between $1-5 USD. For a student there was only so much to spend, and betting on that horse with all my savings would have been unreasonable.

Okay, in short: a raspberry pi is not enough to get any Bitcoins. You either need a miner to mine Bitcoin, or rely on the goodwill of others if you run a node.
However, there is probably tons of stuff related to the blockchain you can do on a Pi, that are educational and fun, and perhaps indirectly profitable.
Besides, the Pi is a cheap yet powerful ARM computer in itself. I use them for many things: running 2 USB miners, home networking, kitchen computer &amp;c.

Calling blocksize a minor issue flies in the face of any understanding of bitcoin. Disagreement on this issue is substantial, not due to any feature of de/centralization. They're disagreeing about the direction of blockchain technology, not the technical implementations.

Nope. It either a) runs a miner (like a USB attached ASIC) or b) runs a network node.
I have a model 1 B+ running 2 R-Box Rockminers. They earn Bitcoin and the Pi provides the mining software and network. _You can_ get donations for b) running a node, if you submit your node to a list; but it's more a token of appreciation for the altruistic participation than anything else.

@_date: 2015-12-03 09:16:00
'Replaced' is a little misleading, but not wrong.
On the one hand, there is huge competition in software development. The term _replaced_ suggests this scenario, where an alternative with a bigger block size will somehow make redundant the current implementation. I personally think this alternative imitates and presupposes the way things are done in big banking.
On the other hand, is the idea of BTC as the people coin, a "cryptographically democratic" invention that transcends the citizen and empower individuals. It is not apparent that this alternative requires a bigger block size. (We could see new conventions  where zero-conf transactions are commonplace.)
That these two implementations are in contradiction is false. An alternative with a bigger block size will exist alongside the  current implementation. Miners and wallets decide. What's important is that blockchain technology enables them both.

@_date: 2015-12-28 21:25:54


That isn't true. If the value of bitcoin is the revolution of money, making money directly democratic (in peer-to-peer exchange), then it is transformative in that it actually forces us to get rid of the obsolete or "inefficient" system of middle-men. If however, the blocksize is increased to mimic the current model of several tiers of middle-men, the technology is not disruptive, nor revolutionary, but only furthering the status quo.
The former puts blockchain as a new, fundamental technology of civilization, putting Bitcoin in a mindboggingly central place. The latter puts blockchain in the sidelines, as a tool for big finance. Which one do you think makes Bitcoin worth more?
There is a substantial difference between the two strategies, and both have pros and cons. This, to me, is what's exciting about this and other social technologies.

If I'm not mistaken you refuted your own statement:)
"Bitcoin has X culture" can be true while stile having cultures Y, Z , n.
Culture can be seen as institutionally complete, in which case the above is obviously false, as you say. But the _sense_ of "Bitcoin has X culture" is to expose a problematic or admirable feature of the Bitcoin community. Internal contradictions are to be expected because the community members are ultimately individuals. But that too still doesn't make Bitcoin having culture X impossible.

I was being sarcastic.
But reputable sourcing is the way to go and not identical to authority. Check out peer review, for example.
@_date: 2014-11-24 11:21:47


The same peer review that made it possible to detect and out those tricksters, yes.
Why would you argue against a p2p system in The bureaucracy of peer review might be corrupt at any time and place, but its structure allows discovery and correction.
A weakness for that bureaucracy is local politics. More and more countries are adopting a system where publications = payment points. This is an invitation for producing papers of little value.
If there is anything allowing the exposure of such corruption it is the very system those papers are published into, because it is peer reviewed.
This all presupppses the debate of what constitutes objectivity. In short, the most successful answer is intersubjectivity. Not, as you pointed out, authoritative sources,  nor having to replicate all science yourself.
Thus a system of peer review is meritocratic, but always open to scrutinize reputable sources if something justifies further work.
Mistakes and corruption always exist, but for a shorter while and with less implications in a system where any 'node' can object.

I think you are confused.
A. No one is telling you what to do. At best, they're offering advice, otherwise they're trying to spread enthusiasm about _what they think_ is a way to go. Both requires agreement and judgment for it (their idea) becoming what you do. By entering into a plea for your participation they are _confirming your autonomy_.
B. If you look at the technology, the currency market, BTC adoption in users and merchants respectively; I think we can all agree that the challenges (some real, some not) facing each respective facet of Bitcoin have many qualitatively different remedies. This entails that "the collective" you presume is hard to find.
C. Your view of laws is artificially static and historically ignorant. Laws are developed to cover cases where people's freedom was previously infringed in a legal vacuum. They are not perfect and thus not written in stone. But they do reflect the universal once the precedent case has been established. Whether this case is sufficient for the law it is covered by, is a matter of continual revision.
D. You assume, rather than argue, that everyone is thinking along the same lines here. Personally, if I see a post about e.g. spending BTC on Black Friday, which I don't intend nor want to, I simply _ignore that post_. And I would imagine this to be true of other redditors vis-à-vis posts that I am interested in as well. I expect your obviously unfounded assumption to be an arbitrary generalization; that no one who are not interested ignore any post whatsoever.
As a fellow individualist I hope you may find some peace in the fact that the world is different than you thought, and that perhaps we've learned something.

You may be right this is what happened here. It sounds like a catch-all holdback, which is standard procedure for unreported income. (I've paid worse and learned my lesson: p)
The thing is, if the income is legit, or tax-deductible etc that is the individual's right and responsibility to document. I am not familiar with Greek taxation in any detailed sense, but in general the govt is responsible for making sure peers are not withholding legitimate tax money from his or her fellow citizen.
My opinion of a catch-all is that some economists speculate that they might get to keep the whole sum, for lack of documentation or inexperience with taxation systems, which I think is shady. But that is not a flaw, just not decent.

Again, let me stress that the cases aren't comparable, but the reasoning is.
The bug might just as well have been discovered by the devs, or in a peer-reviewed journal. In any case, the good that "came out of it" is all thanks to the devs, not Mt.Gox.

Actually you are responsible for reporting your own finances annually, viz. doing your taxes. The converse is that OP did not report it, so the sane thing to do (without too much bureaucracy) is assuming that it is unreported income.

This is a retrofitted explanation, e.g. there is a "hole" in the technology which will inevitably exploited.
It isn't inevitable if nobody does it. Mt.Gox seems more incompetent at doing business than anything else. There is no reason to believe the devs wouldn't have found this bug eventually.
There is a reason the OP expects down votes, which is that incompetence that has bad consequences for other people is a sign that Mt.Gox didn't live up to the responsibility they took on themselves.
Mt.Gox did nothing good for BTC with regards to the case at hand. On the contrary.

You know as well as I that there is two senses of anarchy; one commonsensical (~ "chaos") and then the social theory one (socio-anarchism, anarcho-capitalism, "classic" anarchist theory and the more "primitive" versions).
Your sense sounds somewhat like anarchy as depicted in _News from nowhere_, decentralized cooperatives, no central currency but direct peer to peer trade, work as field of interest (work as entertainment), roaming schools etc.
I was thinking of classical theory though, but mostly addressing the commonsense scenario. Classical theory's ontology is akin to Hobbes' _Leviathan_ . People just calculate somehow that cooperation is best but without a dominating force (king).
The philosophical problem with classical anarchism is that its ontology is too simple to account for cooperation, which (like Hobbes' union of will) is fixed in an ad hocly manner. This version's raison d'etre is simply to oppose all government, and instead generalizes on humanity, and comes full circle using argumentation that is quasi-utilitarian.
The Mad Max scenario (chaos) is not anarchism in any sense of social theory, although viking era Iceland is often purported as an example of working anarchy. But it is the commonsensical one, and _I assumed_ a news article would apply it, as they report and rarely understand the matter.
My 2 cents: I should add that social theories other than anarchy ones typically _do not_ believe society will fall together without a central or any government. This is a strawman in anarchist theory. Since Hobbes' _Leviathan_ there has been a tradition of ontological debate in social theory, that is making account for how, not just why, society works out. In this perspective I would ascribe (perhaps mistakenly!) the ontology of anarchism the features of Hobbesian individualism, think Hobbes, Locke and Mill. It is consequentialist and highly sophisticated theories balancing on the knife edge of atomist individualism. Even Mill couldn't work out his own structural failures, stemming from this type of ontologies, and his theory lack the resources to even account for oppression that he's so afraid of. Don't think I don't respect these thinkers, they have all contributed immensely to our history of thought.

But having the right tools is only step 1, you need to configure and test, and make sure that services actually do what you intend without leaving a gap between them. Plus, keeping up to date with patches and vulnerabilities is also necessary.
This is true of all operating systems. If you want to stay secure, there is no "set it and forget it". The trends of attacks keep changing.
With Steam (and public interest) focusing on the Linux desktop, this will become more and more apparent. Luckily, the bazaar lends itself to meeting new threats much better than the cathedral. This means that while Linux faces the same challenges of security threats, the development architecture around it is more alert and flexible.

The phenomenon of existential angst in existentialism is often misperceived. It is in fact a pathological anxiety breaking down the ability to live. Overcoming it is authenticity, for Heidegger.
The "ultimately pointless" realization has two distinct meanings, much thanks to Sartre's popularity. The common sense one is "a popular reading" of Sartre, which is a form of arrogant relativism. The philosophical reading is a weak Cartesian version of Heidegger that creates more problems than it solves. But Sartre's phenomenological analysis of the Other(s) is interesting and detailed. Hegel's is superior though.
As you can tell, I am not very impressed by Sartre's philosophy.

If Middle Earth had used bitcoin, the Smaug situation would never have happened, and JRR Tolkien would never have been inclined to write Lord of the Rings as a serious sequel to a children's book, ultimately constituting the justification for adult fantasy and literary imagination today; and additionally preventing Peter Jackson cashing out huge, so he can invest in BTC?
How do you explain this atrocity against all nerds and freedom of speech!??

I am also in it for the long term (buying and mining). And as I said, the technology isn't flawed. This is all on Mt.Gox objectively.
However, BTC is a means of exchange and presupposes exchangers (users). If the long term is threatened by the scenario of BTC only being used by miners and investors via a public failure of a "stock exchange" the above population cannot discern from BTC technology, we should have a strategy of dispersing correct information.
E.g. "See? Even the fall of major BTC exchanges does not shake the technology", for example. I am worrying that most BTC news outlets are directed at people who already know the technology. The only notable exception today is FT.
How can the understanding of BTC get in the mainstream? I think it needs more than being a news item. To get non-technical people involved, it must get a foot in at schools, universities etc.

    Bitcoin-qt.exe -help
I'm not a Windows user but in UNIX land you always get a help text running the help flag. In Windows XP it was /help, not -help or --help. 
It probably didn't work OOB since you used a non-default location. In Linux this is ~/.bitcoin and in Windows it's a hidden folder too.
Command line is very user-friendly. Unlike graphical programs you get --help and --usage right there, _saving you_ 15 minutes of Googling ;)

Your comment really made me laugh. I can't tell whether you are serious or not:)
However, you come with a few assertions without any reasons to back them up. Why then, in your opinion, is bitcoin "deeply flawed on a fundamental level"? Or that even theoretically its existence is "stupid". 
This interests me.
If you thought I was identifying Bitcoin with the Internet (in the above senses) in some way, you misunderstood my comment. I was simply pointing out that technological shortcomings did not (and do not) stand in the way of the Internet coming to its place in modern society, and that Bitcoin (for me) has the potential to do so as well. But it is still early days.

To clarify my question; for BTC's public reputation, is it possible that Mt Gox is "too big to fail"? If they fail, and is publicly misperceived as a backbone of BTC economy, how should we strategically meet the public with the right information?
@_date: 2014-08-18 08:39:56


Not really true though. As long as your running costs &lt; bitcoins mined, and you mine in a sizeable pool with NMC merged mining, you're making bitcoins and potential profit. However, don't expect ROI in the short term or at all.
It usually comes down to electricity costs. My miners are run by a Sheevaplug computer to use less power administrating it. It's mostly for fun. Currently, the 1st miner has paid for ~43% of its initial costs. But I live in Norway, which has abundant waterfall electricity.
I could have sold BTC at several times and secured ROI, it all depends on the market. I didn't because I am lazy:)

In broad strokes, yes. I have no illusions regarding Google either, and I've had the pleasure of working for (though never been employed by) Apple..
I do like the data liberation group inside Google but I'm not sure how they're faring these days.
The difference is huge in attitude though. Google has the summer of code and similar projects, and they open source what they can* while Apple and MS what they must. Apple (or Jobs, rather) wrote that he would've avoided open source (GPL) if he could have done things over. This sat a precedence for CEOs and the law depts of many companies.

Since this happened the price of BTC has fallen dramatically. The question is, will the Mt.Gox failure reflect negatively on BTC in perpetuity and doom the fundamental project?
I know the tech works, and e-shops are currently coming along; but if Mt.Gox's failure (despite them fixing it) publicly undermines the reputation of all other BTC traders/markets, how will the general adaption crucial to BTC survival continue?

What I probably understated was that I believe these changes will take effect on some major level. But it is a belief. My reference to the Internet was that it too was a niche technology which some geeks saw great potential in. The Internet could also not have happened (qua global infrastructure), if no one believed in its potential.


In actuality, the early days of the Internet (in terms of Arpanet and InterNet) was stringed together by loose wire and bubblegum. _Gradually_ incremental improvements building on past experience were made.
In terms of communication, many systems (email, ftp, ssl etc) have time and again been demonstrated as inherently flawed. Not only in themselves but also in terms of exposing underlying, systematic flaws vis-à-vis praxis. That is why Google made Wave for instance. They failed because they didn't adequately answer why it should exist.
In terms of being a social network, the Internet succeed because a few entrepreneurs thought everyone would, or really, should want to have a computer in their home, transforming the mainframe "paradigm".
This should tell us that changes are incremental, willed, but also accidental, and historical throughout. When speaking of Bitcoin, then, it might as you say implode and disappear. We cannot say whether it will be a success or simply be a building block for a new "paradigm".
This all depends on how well it answers the why question.
You don't see that it contains a _raison d'être_, which is fine. But I do. And at this early stage it is hard to predict anything, but as the history of the Internet (and indeed all social institutions) show, technological shortcomings are not decisive. Let's agree to disagree, and history be the judge.

I think it's ignorance rather than malice. The word and iconology of email is akin to closed envelope, not a postcard passed from hand to hand (as email currently does*).
The FSFE is lobbying European politicians and decision makers to inform about privacy and encryption, not to mention rights. It's a slow process, but I'm certain they are slowly raising the bar.
PGP/GPG is the closed envelope email we want, which is an advance on the physically closed envelope that's only protected by proxy (through authority), since its protection is inherent.

Thanks for your reply. But you're still just repeating that Bitcoin is either shit, stupid or flawed. I'm genuinely interested in why you think so, some reasons why it is as shitty as you say it is.
I don't think Bitcoin has potential because it is a technology. Rather it is because it enables peer to peer value exchange (like cash), with public/private key encryption (like gpg), and the process is inherently transparent and public. To me that spells both a technological as well as sociopolitical advantage over cash.
Of course, Bitcoin isn't _nationalized_ (ignoring e.g. Spaincoin &amp;tc atm), so that is a major difference between Bitcoin and money. It is nothing without the Internet.

I personally feel the term "Pedo ring" is analogous to "witch covenant". The play on mysticism is a doorway to political manipulation.
Let's call it what it is; human trafficking or _slavery._ Age or gender doesn't matter. Some people aspiring to own others as property, not "the elite", not "satanic worshippers" and not "pedo rings".
You are incredibly naive if you believe that pedophiles run a global network. Pedophiles tap into an already existing trade, wherein children is low risk. It's an entire market, not a single minded "ring" of pedophiles.
Most children bought and sold are demonstrably NOT used for sexual exploitation. Go read a report.

He is very well read in real world politics and long-term political agendas. Personally, I think he answers truthfully to a weird or unqualified question. (I should preface this with that I have not seen the entire interview. Context is king, I imagine.)
The question doesn't ask whether BTC will be critical or crucial for the (possibility of a) (future) stateless society, OTOH it does not entertain any minor role for Bitcoin either. I mean, just about anything could in principle be _said to enable_ the emergence of a functional stateless society. Like oxygen. Or O2. Or breeding pigs. Or amazon warrior women. Or an infectious disease that drained the population, leaving it "free" for the taking.
It all depends what the hell we are talking about. What is a stateless society exactly? A family? A tribe? A commune? What kind of existing infrastructure of the "old world" is presupposed here? &amp;c. Or are we talking about cosmopolitanism? Classical communism? Anarcho-capitalism?

The term 'benevolent dictator' usually end up being the creator(s) of the software, like Linus for Linux, who gets a socially accepted final say. Linus spends his days now reading through and accepting/dismissing changes, but that is actually different from a dictator.
A dictator not only sets the terms for debate but also enforces a narrow egocentric development. Linus only does the former, but has no say in a) what problems are being worked out, b) patches to deal with them. He even has lieutenants who filter out most fluff or sign changes, people who Linus trusts.
A more dictatorial scheme is found in Slackware IMHO, where Pat guides his vision throughout. (I love Slackware by the way, but that's "just" because I agree with Pat a long way.)
You could say the strategies involved are, in Linux, protective and in Slackware proactive. Bitcoin is different. Since nodes vote in a democratic manner the developers will have to face disagreements that in effect renders their decision void. This entails that development will not be as swift as in other projects IMO. Which to me is a good thing.
People who cry stagnation are ignoring that the network is not stagnant. The development of Bitcoin is not like the development of most F/OSS, it's more like the development of the internet itself.

It depends on what you mean by "backed by". To me the USD, as most fiat currencies are, is backed by military power and bileteral and international agreements. Bitcoin is backed by proof-of-work in a global cryptographic network.

What do you mean? US military power seriously influences the petroleum market. Of course, that's a matter of interpretation.
So apart from the US and our current banking, conventional, historical fiat currency has always had military force behind it. Typically featuring a king or an emperor on the coin(s) itself to instill the same effect.
Bitcoin is in that respect a _huge liberal step in the right direction._ That's not to say that Bitcoin will be the "winning implementation" or that it will gain traction at all (for the majority). It's fun to watch this unfold.

Large bills are used by criminals and grandmothers in my home country. No one under 50 pays in cash. When I have cash, I convert them asap.
Cash is easy to steal, and I've been mugged more than once. The privacy cash gives is not really true privacy unless you launder it. How many people in existence have the routines of you? So, cash gives a false sense of privacy when I can correlate with other data points.
Cash is privacy where above data is not already collected. Privacy must be realized for the basic good and social requirement for freedom that it is, and protected by law, police, judges, the state and the international courts.

You're correct, as long as it stays encrypted. You cannot use the data until it's decrypted, so your key is present in memory or through a file.
Once a drive is decrypted, it's decrypted for anyone with access. If you have access to sub-kernel code you'll have full access to the OS. So no need to break the encryption. You just fetch the key or the data at your convenience.

Yes. I should point out I was relating to the concept universally. Like I think I said (can't remember), it is perfectly fine to conceive of property in its current expression, as we both know it, qua law, that is enforceable by the state. It wouldn't entail much practical inconsistency. It's just not an exhaustive definition.




Exactly, I'm glad you mentioned this. This is perhaps where we come to an understanding. In my view, the tribal practice you mention would be a _different concept_ of property, rather than a lack of or looser version of the concept you and I use.
To view their perfectly working concept of property as relative to ours is to impose our view as the standard. Instead, I would propose that property is essentially a solution to physical possession (having to hold on to something with my hands to own it) which different cultures have solved differently.
The asymmetry between some models stem perhaps from scalability problems. 'Share-owning' may not fare well faced with the industrial world, but in its own environment it would be just as fully experienced by those practicing that concept as ours is to us. They, as we, know immediately and as a rule when the concept was impinged, and practical measures (like solving disputes) follow for the exceptions.

It is, indirectly, though. Nodes are necessary. They directly affect the value of the network (and the coins). Thus everyone using bitcoin have an incentive to run or support a node.
AFAIK, early btc core code ran nodes while mining. Pools take away that option, but relays the responsibility to the pool.

Norway is pretty cashless. They removed the largest bills recently, since apart from grannies, cash is mostly used by criminals. (Of course, the criminals causing the huge inequalities are in finance, playing with debt, digits and paper.)

I think he was asking about what the object consists of, that was stolen. Which would be a globally recognized amount of BTC vis-à-vis whose keys they belong to.


That may be how it is written in law texts, IANAL, but it's not a feasible definition of property. Property is an institution between individuals, like a promise or a bet. Breaking a promise has consequences, social repercussions, regardless of the state existing or not.
The government's authority (legal use of force) only serves as additional risk, in the eyes of the thief. Depending on the size of the theft, this additional risk may be 0.
The nature of the active property concept in a community is the object of social anthropology, not law.

Now you are confusing property and possession:) It isn't mine because I said so, I was simply stating that it is my property. If that translated to, in the following, that you somehow took ownership of it, it would _only_ entail that you could not be trusted with other people's property, it wouldn't mean that property was not presupposed.
Why is it mine? Because I got it as a gift, I bought it, I made it, I found it, etc. That doesn't really matter unless there is a dispute. We will accept the great majority of property claims prima facie, unless we have reason to believe we're being scammed.
That was an overly verbosive example too. In every day life, we wouldn't even have to state that "this is mine", unless the question arises. If I enter the room with a jacket, and leave it by the chair while I go to the bathroom, it isn't "up for grabs" while I'm gone. Granted that they saw me (or have seen me) wearing that jacket will know that it is mine. And even if that wasn't the case (I could be borrowing it long-term from my brother), they would also know that it meant it not being theirs.
Furthermore, in the off chance that you challenge my right to it when I returned (which _would be considered rude_ by those around you), we will find a way to settle it. This is when authority _can_ be contacted, but I can just as fully, in full accordance with the concept of property relinquish any right I have to it simply by deciding to.
I can decide that I wouldn't want a pencil come between our friendship, for instance. Laws cannot make judgment calls such as "this house should now belong to Lenny because you're so good friends". They must follow the abstract conditions, not the concrete social ones in which property has a meaning.


Social community, or existing as a social being, underlies rather than guarantees any concept of ownership. It isn't others that guarantee my ownership, inasmuch as the concept presupposes the existence of others to be a concept.
If you imagine someone calling "shotgun!" to get the front seat, they are claiming that seat. Others will respect and don't take that seat insofar as they know what "shotgun!" means. They can also start fighting for the seat _despite_ knowing what "shotgun!" means. This is what Habermas refers to as going into practical discourse, where the "rules of calling shotgun!" comes into play.
They aren't laws, nor guaranteed by anyone, they are customary practices that are being practiced and socially reproduced (and once may perish). Historically, it's a genuine American phenomenon, wherein the front of the horse carriage would have room for two, and the one not reigning the horses would more likely than not be carrying a weapon. Today it has nothing to do with weapons or horses, but reservation of seats.
Property is the same kind of phenomenon, that is so important in society that it has _also_ been codified. In other societies there are other kinds of ownership, which a social anthropologist may inform us both about better than I can. In sum, property preceeds the laws, government, police what have you that _currently_ protects it.
That is not to say that they're irrelevant, not that you cannot think of property in those terms, nor that its being codified hasn't changed it (because it has! think about the British Empire "conquering the world by the cunning use of flags", in the words of Eddie Izzard). But they are contingent, not universal terms, so they don't cover the phenomenon we're facing.


Not at all. If I _gave_ you the sheep, it would be yours because that's what _giving_ means. If I _borrowed_ you the sheep, it would _not_be yours, because that's entailed in the concept of borrowing. If there was any misunderstanding, it wouldn't be because either concept was faulty, only because we did not communicate clearly enough or someone was trying to take advantage of someone.
@_date: 2015-02-16 17:21:15


Yes. 
You're misinterpreting. We have established that the exceptions, problems, conflicts inevitably arising from the rule or praxis _are_ dealt with conventionally. In _our_ societies these conventions have been codified in law, and we have (in principle) uniform execution of them with several layers of insurance.
The ontological difference is important: when you say that we're relying on the government to have property, you're focusing on the exception rather than the rule Property is not defined in terms of theft, rather, theft depends on property to exist as such.
There is a thirdness or convention in the execution of property. When I say to you that "this pencil is mine" _you know_ that it is also mine when I'm not there and when you are asked by someone else to have it. It is mine in a pretty universal sense. This is _primarily_ what we actually and consistently rely on.
This thirdness can be backed up by honor, threat, love etc. and its embodiment are many, _including_ the government. But we mustn't confuse the backing up with the convention.
For instance, the laws covering the 1920s apartment block I live in are such that _no one owns a flat._ Instead each of the 18 owners are legally shareholders.
However, there is _no confusion_ about who lives where and what flat is mine. If we went by law and not what laws try to protect, the other 17 owners could easily decide that the part I own is actually the hallway spaces. Since there is a concept of ownership which these laws rely on, I would be crazy to fear that that could ever happen.
I.e. laws are interpreted by the intention of what existing phenomenon they're trying to protect. In the counterfactual case that it _needed_ backing up, it would be thus interpreted by the court. But that is an extreme unlikely case. And it is not that by virtue of which I own it. I own it because I bought it.




You're not making a fair argument here. Let us say that _sans any government_ but in a community, I borrowed you a a sheep or whatever. You _could_ choose to not honor the arrangement, and you would be a sheep richer. Why wouldn't you? And indeed many have. But they paid for it in different ways, mainly social exclusion and the recurring cost of no one else wanting to help you out.
And while there are conmen and thieves who do this for a living, they are the minority. If the majority would snuff you on the deal, that deal (and in our case, that institution) would very soon cease to be socially reproduced. And any law pertaining to it would be sleeping paragraphs and later rather than sooner revisioned away.

Sorry, I was too sparse here. I didn't intend micro transactions proper, only to put it in a macro/micro perspective.
If e.g. VISA's real world transactions are called micro, and their confirmation and propagation in the world economy is the macro perspective; the similarity between that system and one for Bitcoin becomes perhaps more apparent.
VISA must accept and administer 30K transactions today (antecedent), but it doesn't have the technology to verify the quantitative movements in the economy (consequence) _simultaneously_. Thus VISA accepts the transactions in "good faith" at a cost of insurance.
With BTC we're facing the same problem, and a solution could perhaps be to do the same.
The large quantity of "micro transactions", or transactions in a micro perspective, is done in a side chain which must be connected to the block chain, which is the macro perspective.
For instance, I have a mortgage. I can move it around between banks and banks can move it around. It is not a currency, but it has a real world value (for me :debt, and for banks: interests).
It is only insisting on BTC as a currency (qua value, commodity)  and not in terms of means of exchange (which is the utility of currency) that we have this problem.
Instead, BTC could be valued as the means by which a side chain coin is worth something, to be used on the micro level. I'm not sure if it is feasible or indeed practical, not to mention sane, but it is a way to press forward the point that a 10 minute global and purely computational verification process is an advancement of e.g. VISA's, which is contingent and slow.

The way block device encryption works combined with hardware manufacturers (possibly) installing backdoors at the lower level (think network card chips, HDD firmware), means that the attacker may "simply" pick up the data when it's decrypted. This scary speculation would put a damper on my efforts, if I were working on TC. There's also the message they left, indicating that _they had to_ close it down.
I just think the timing of Snowden's going public and TC closing shop was suspicious. _grabs tinfoil_

You're missing my point. _Today_ property is properly regulated by law, superceeding that of custom, religion etc. in terms of execution. Even to the point of becoming its "justification" by way of confusion.
How people resolved conflicts regarding property depends on which people you're studying. Conflict is a part of everyday life, so we develop conflict-solving practices, like having a witness, resolving disputes in council or the technology of a receipt. These are not the justification of the practice but ways to deal with practical problems in its execution.
However, if we determine property solely in terms of law, you have reached the untenable position that nations without a judicial body can have no property, when empirical study finds the opposite. What I'm saying must be understood developmentally, of course. What is today the law of a sovereign, was yesterday the word of the church, and so on.
Your example is excellent to refute your own point. The guy returning from vacation is rightfully flabbergasted, and so is his peers, since the thieves are not acting according to the concept of property and instead creating an exception, the conflict. The feeling of injustice on behalf of that guy serves to show how property is a social matter. If it was purely legal, we wouldn't have revenge.
I'm not saying law is superfluous, not here and now. I'm only saying that the practice isn't justified by law, it's merely protected by it. A good law is such that it is identical with the way this was conventionally done in the prior _legal_ vacuum.
