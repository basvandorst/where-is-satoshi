Yes, any mixing would definitely "mix" things up in this scenario. To XMR and back via SS could be the good option as long as you do not get your own coins back in return from SS that is.

Still need more explanation please ! (?) - what is it ? and what is changing your original ? (original what ?) - BTC (and other coins for that matter), and if I want to talk in your language, it's an "IN / OUT" thing - most wallets, on-line or not keep changing the "receive" address for each new transaction - the older IDs still remaining operational.
What I would suggest here is that you tell "us" what you want to achive here and maybe someone out here can help you...

The answer is B if your store only accepts bitcoin. Further, to my knowledge, you can not send fiat funds to 3rd parties via your coinbase fiat vallet (USD, EUR) - you can only retrieve fiat to your own verified bank account.
Now tell us all who had the correct answer among yourselves - you or your buddy ? ;)

isilines currently operates towards 80 destinations within France and offers "budget" pricing for the trips. They are using PAYMIUM as the payment processor. PAYMIUM charges are quite high so guess there'll be enough turn over to cover the costs while maintaining the current FIAT pricing.
Example pricing : Paris to Montpellier (800KM / 11h drive) -&gt; cheapest fare is 9 EUR one way, that works out to about $11 which is quite cheap.
The service is actually operated by EUROLINES under the service mark isilines. EUROLINES is a TRANSDEV company.
Info for those who would find the name **ISIL**ines a bit "confusing" : the letter **I** in french is pronounced **E** so the idea behind the name is for it to sound **EASY**lines, voila !

Nice idea. I had an issue testing it but it works as expected. FYI, anyone in WINDOWS can use the command line tool **nslookup -q=txt addressinhex.dnscoin.nz** to test it out.

B12 is still available at bitmaintech for 200$ cheaper than the B13 for 12TH. B13 is more expensive for 13TH. In both cases you need to add the cost of power supply (not provided) + shipping + customs depending on destination.
I would wait for the R4 - you can run 16+TH with 2 of them for almost the same power draw/consumption, will have to wait till 8/29 to see the pricing of these new units.

No, lost BTC adds more value to the rest of it that's not lost - anyways, there's no way to know that BTC is actually "lost".

Yes, if you sell  it asap when it goes up + $200 minus the fees. If you sell it if it goes down by $200 then you would loose $200. About the taxes, it depends where you live and how bitcoin is treated at your tax location (currency, asset, commodity...) - on the other hand, if you just hold on to it, you will always only have 1 BTC, nothing more, nothing less.
@_date: 2016-08-22 13:00:44
Yes, the format which is commonly known as a BTC address is in BASE58 - you need to convert it into HEX (using the link in my previous post on this thread for example) before using it to retrieve the balance via a DNS query.

The transaction fee is "less than recommended" (Fees = 0.000096 BTC) - that said, you should have it soon. There are currently a bit over 11k transactions pending.

Indirectly, as there'll be less coins in circulation than the expected total of 21mil as when that last block will be mined. That will add more value to existing coins.
Example : 100 coins with market cap of $1000 so each coin has a $10 value
Now if 10 of these coins are lost while the market cap still being $1000, each of the resting 90 coins would automatically have a $11 value.

I guess you are correct, that said - any bank would not know if and when their customer is going to turn into/become a "scam" or go out of business - companies big or small go out of business in a smaller scale everyday with or without collateral damage to customers - for example, just within this community and that includes me, how many mining hardware vendors have gone out of business after people paying for pre orders - I am sure all the concerned banks of these companies did not know that they were going to scam customers and close down.

I think giving larger increments to a smaller population will have a better effect than the opposite - like some of the airdrops that have happened before. That will give press and other exposure which will in return work better with adoption.
The thing here is that the "poor people" need cash not crypto and today converting BTC into cash is not simple nor easy even for people who are not poor - As most poor people do not have access to bank accounts, have no proper IDs or nor utility bills most of the time (let alone the idea of having access to a scanner, a computer to scan/upload the KYC/AML documents and internet access), converting BTC to cash is not going to be possible for them specially if it is for a small amount such as a dollar or less.

To my knowledge,  when this happens, either one of the two blocks ( miner 1 or miner 2 block) will be orphaned.
If miner 1 block is orphaned, then tx11 will be on the chain as miner 2 would have the valid block. If miner 2 block is orphaned, then tx11 will be mined on the next block as it was not included in miner 1 block.

Yes, it is crazy... they should at least warn you before or validate the uploaded ID/Utility stuff on the fly (or at least within a reasonable time) AND respond to support tickets within a reasonable time - now we have to wait for someone to press a button and we don't know when that someone is going to be available at XAPO to do that.

I guess that the idea behind it is on the "fine print". GDAX states : "This insurance policy does not cover damages resulting from a specific user's loss..."

QR code is the abbreviation for Quick Response Code and was originally designed/invented in 1994 for the car industry in Japan.
It is "used" in Bitcoin today to facilitate the "reading" of the BTC address of a wallet but is not a part of Bitcoin. QR codes are used widely in multiple applications such as to re route the reader to a web site or application, for tracking packages or checking passengers of an airline during boarding (printed on the boarding pass or e-ticket).
Basically a QR code can contain anything - a numeric only code can contain up to 7089 chars and alpha numeric code can contain up to 4096 chars.
So, there is nothing wrong in that company in Slovakia using these QR codes in services that they offer or sell.

Xapo seems to be a good option where it is available and if one does not mind the fees. It is not pre loaded with fiat but converts BTC to fiat at the moment the card is used. There are other cards out there but most of them require fiat preload.

It's not the only one - see this for another example that just poped out :
Guess people are nowadays aware of such scams - That said, BAD that it's paid advertising from Google which is misleading for nOOb seen that it appears on the results page.

No, they only offer a VISA Debit plastic card - but, you can still use it as a "virtual card" though I guess as card details, view pin etc are also accessible from their dashboard GUI

Most BTMs require a phone number to which they send a one time password for purchasing. Maybe if you go through the KYC/AML requirements at the BTM then there's no need for a phone, this depends on the BTMs I guess but I know that Bitaccess BTMs allows KYC/AML requirements processing directly on the BTM.
Otherwise, you can print your destination wallet QR code and scan it as the destination wallet during the purchase process or you can collect a paper wallet from the BTM and redeem it later - here you'll just need a phone that can receive text messages, not a smartphone.
