Most of them cashed out to buy something they wanted, not because they were forced. I just ordered a brand new cayman s. :)

Having bitcoin on an exchange for a prolonged amout of time is a [very bad idea](

Do I sense a hint of envy in your post? I sold because I finally reached enough for my dream car, and it's more fun to have that than to watch some numbers online go up (or down).
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:47:32
They don't sell the 918 anymore :P If I wanted the 918 tech I'd get the new panamera hybrid.

Do you have a reading disability? I said you should contact kraken to confirm, and I'll PM them my withdrawal number when you do that. (But again, you won't do that, I'm sure.)
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:04:36
Really, they don't have the same title. They share part of the title. I'm guessing you really have a reading disability, maybe you should see someone about that.
I told you how you can verify that my claim is true, but you don't want to do it - because you want to convince yourself that it isn't true. It's pretty obvious.
Anyway I'm just tagging you as *envious little bitch* and be done with it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:30:25
Like I said, find someone from kraken on reddit that's willing to confirm and I'll pm them my withdrawal number. [There]( a whole list of support on the right. But I'm sure you won't do that.

I've always lived very frugaly, despite having money - I've always wanted a porsche cayman though, so this gives me a perfect reason to get it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:03:54
I want a car to have some fun, not to be an investment. I understand some people obviously don't get it, but that's fine.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:57:31
Cheers! I'll still be here, because I'm interested in the technical aspect of things, just won't hold any coins, at least not for now.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:28:12
I proposed a solution for you to verify but... *crickets*
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:36:59
It's still a win if you sold with profit.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:51:43
Yup, pretty much. I know it's tough for some people to accept the fact someone else is possibly more successful than them. The sooner you accept the fact there will always be such people the better off you'll be.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:08:26
Thanks, it's been a wild ride, and it made me a lot more calm as a result.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:08:53
Why not? I've always wanted one.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:08:06
I received the withdrawal the same day. Afaik it's not a problem with kraken but with their usd payment processor.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:43:25
Ah yes, it's easier to live in denial. Some people were successful, deal with it. If you get a kraken employee on board I'd be more than willing for him to confirm my withdrawal request amount. I know you won't do that because it'd be a hard pill to swallow.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:55:25
Except that you can't avoid being cheated on but you can avoid having money on an exchange it's exactly the same, yes.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:09:12
It's more about having fun than being an investment. The bitcoin profits are pure play money for me.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:51:22
If you lost money with the mtgox (or any other exchange that lost people's money) fiasco you would probably have a very different opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:22:16
Damn that's tough to hear. I'm actually european so I have no idea what the situation is in the us. I hope it turns better soon.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:46:50
I'm waiting...

The dollar gets traded on a much larger scale




It's trading exactly like everything else is traded in the free market - bread, eggs, vegetables, oil, gold, it's all about what people are willing to pay for it.

[I'm sure he'll call it fake though.](
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:15:23
Getting the cayman, never liked the boxster.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:16:55
Time to find a better paying job then! Also happy cakeday!
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:12:27
I already have a daily car, but the civic sure is pretty fun for the price.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:36:43
I posted a screenshot. If you want more proof you'll have to contact kraken for them to confirm it.
Which 2 posts would that be? I know it's hard to come to terms with reality buddy, I'm still waiting for you to contact kraken support. I also don't think what FUD actually means.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:17:36
I'll swing by the dealership next week, but I'm not sure if they even have the GT4, at least not on the website. It's also probably out of my budget - the base price in the us would just about cover it but over here they're about 30% more expensive in general. I think I could easily get the cayman S with options for the bitcoin money I got.
