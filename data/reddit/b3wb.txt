Twister P2P also makes me very excited:   a slick p2p blogging platform, using bitcoin and bittorrent implementations. It's almost like taking [bitmessage]( to a whole new level. I'm ready for the future no more censorship. This could be a great way for sharing filehost links (MEGA, ZippyShare, MediaFire, Uploaded). No more posts getting taken down everyday like whack-a-mole. It could replace Blogger and bloated automated blogs and bring music blogs back. Then we can make our own p2p search engine. The days of DMCA and Google will be over with.

Q coins we're centralized. So all they had to do was call the company in charge and tell them to stop. Bitcoin is different it's in the peoples hands.

Most people know how to use PutLocker. Also are you using adblockplus? Almost all sites have fake download adverts they are easy to avoid. It also streams in a flash player (it's a flv, well converted to one). Just click free user, then a video player shows up, no adverts at all on my end. Things like adblockplus should be and are kind of default now... complain to modern web developers. Quicktip: Click free user , second page loads with embedded flash video player , have your adblocker enabled to avoid fake adverts.

Buttercoin is backed by Google Ventures  but the ones your talking about are still in very early stages of development (Also Buttercoin is a different idea to me). People will open exchanges all over the world, if one major exchange  goes down 3 will take it's place. Bitcoin right now is like the bare bones framework and foundation of what's yet to come. Be patient and let these ideas hatch over time. We we're never ready for a stable market at this moment in time. These blockades by the government we're imminent. It's part of the experiment... part of the foundation to stir things up. It was never going to be smooth sailing, in time we will make it past these rough waters. If we stick together we can succeed. The people who believe in bitcoins world changing principles are the true bitcoiners. These hacks who want to make fast cash don't belong here. Greed and fear of government control will be our downfall. Screw control I'm not giving up this easily!

It's funny because before SR existed there was a popular free to play MMORPG called Silkroad Online or SRO. Very similar to WoW, it was a lot of fun before all the bots and my first MMO experience.

I meant people will keep using bitcoin since it breaks up in decimals (uBTC, mBTC, satoshi's, ext) instead of using altcoins like litecoin. There is no advantage, altcoins are only good for trading for other crypto currency's. I couldn't see them replacing bitcoin, unless something out of the ordinary occurs. LTC relies to heavily on bitcoin, and if one falls, how will it take it's place? Only thing that comes to mind is if Scrypt gains a massive advantage over SHA-256d (highly unlikely).

The Chinese are very protective of the Yuan. We all knew this was going to happen. Regardless bitcoin has proven it's useful. It's the peoples currency not the governments. That being said I can never see it staying mainstream. This is a revolutionary tool to redistribute wealth, and lash back against the current flawed system. Think out of the box, WE control this currency, WE can keep bitcoin rolling. Make use of Tor and other security tools, and keep the loopholes flowing.

PPD filehosts like filecloud already pay you in bitcoin for uploading files. Of course they follow DMCA so you would have to cloak your files. MEGA (free encrypted cloud platform) accepts bitcoin as payment for more space and bandwidth. These features are primitive compared to the suggestions above though.

After more thought these are some of the things altcoins have going for them. Scrypt (which litecoin uses) makes it harder to mine, unless ASIC's are made in the future that handle scrypt. I don't know if that could be considered an advantage. Reason number 2 is since altcoins aren't as "mainstream" and more obscure. They may have the tendency to attract illicit activity and scams. Altcoins are technically more anonymous, making them more useful for niche reasons.
