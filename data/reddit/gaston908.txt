@_date: 2017-12-02 15:12:29
It's a fair point. But for better or worse, solutions like this will keep popping up until bitcoin scales.
I can get exposure to bitcoin and send and receive bitcoin to my revolut contacts with zero transaction fees.
On Thursday, I will do an airdrop to all of my contacts, so they will all have a little BTC to keep in their wallet. (Will do another air drop if the price crashes :D)
They ARE enabling external transactions in 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:48:36
good luck man.

Or use ripple :D

UK more friendly? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:59:54
Due to btc exponetial growth, it wont be long before there are more people who bought after the fork than who bought before. They dont get bch too.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:30:17
Excellent choice.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:24:58
Ermm why didn't anyone warn me it was going to crash?
I follow all the tweeters and I have read all the reddits, why didnt anyone tell the community it was going to crash upwards this time? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:34:34
Id rather pay my boss back the $10 i owe him in revolut btc, than btc from my ledger, if he accepts it thats fine. No feez :D
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:24:22
Bitpay could of at least tried segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:22:03
But you can get more than 1 baby in 9 months :)
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:55:37
All crypto is volatile isnt it ? I think bitcoin is "loosing" more users to fees than to volatility. 
(Bitcoin obviously isn't loosing more users than its gaining, right now)
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:04:36
If you can do it without support it might be better, I know a lot of people who cant access accounts from 2013 - because they cant remember the I.P. they set up the account with. Why would they??

Transaction id? all depends on your fee, very busy network right now
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:46:25
Agree - 3 years and bitcoin is going to suffer tremendously. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:24:38
Ver Ver! Very nice work by the way. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:04:42
It's revolut, a European bank/app which I have been using for years, it basically gives you foreign currency at the interbank rate instead of being ripped off at currency exchange places. 
Its only in beta at the minute (released in full on Thursday)
1.5% mark up on crypto exchange
First version doesnt let you send outside of the revolut ecosystem so they are the custodian.
Still a fantastic first step for the mainstream until lightning network etc gets up and running. I can now send BTC to my buddies in a few seconds "offchain"
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:31:49
Until bitcoin scales - its the best solution we have for non techy ppl who want exposure right now (and also want to spend on a debit card or send to friends)
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:33:36
My bank just added bitcoin :D

I'm still on the case. As one of the few people to even get a single coin back,and as a large investor. I have been contacted by a bounty hunter from back in the day. He is worryingly confident but im still waiting for replies from a few people to confirm returned amounts.

(Big blocks scare me.)
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:26:59
Well, they are about to support btc purchases directly in the app so I suppose it removes some competition :)

@_date: 2017-11-24 11:24:50
Yea users who bought post fork dony care about how much the bitcoin COULD be worth if they bought earlier :D
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:28:20
The app i use exclusively to transmit funds, buy foreign currency, pay friends and buy stuff (umm, : "banking") is adding bitcoin in a week so yea, happening, even with the 1% mark up on BTC conversions, I doubt I will keep a whole lot of other currencies on there.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:27:19
Bitcoin debit cards are a thing, services like purse.io are a thing (not an endorsement) for buying on amazon.
Plenty of places accept bitcoin there are lists on google :)
Bank apps like square and revolut are allowing people to "bank" in bitcoin.

That's only what some people think when buying. Give it a few years, you might prefer your bitcoin to fiat. (Realisation   occurs faster in certain geographic locations)

I can probably find you a Venezuelan/Argentinian/Ukranian etc that thinks bitcoin "provides real impact and value" Just because you live in a country where your central bank issued fiat is lovely* doesn't change the fact some people will always value its impact/utility bla bla.

They will come down on bitcoin, no doubt it will impact the price  heavily short term. long term, im not so worried.

Run, run in the opposite direction from MtGox.
@_date: 2013-10-09 07:51:59
Perhaps, I don't know if it's still the case but there are a lot of BTC changing hands at the minute. It's the highest I have seen these 24hr volumes (Apart from the mad rush in April etc)

FIRST OF ALL! SPAM -  Go and get yourself registered! 
The reason they do it so cheap is it's peer to peer, they don't swap cash on the forex market. They just look at the rate, and then swap your currency for you with a counter party.

pretty friendly

Bitcoin lending will come. It is inevitable. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 10:01:42
If you are going to make something that my folks can't use. I think you should have a rethink!

I guess making a successful withdrawal from gox is a bit like entering a raffle. It's fairly uncertain.

price manipulation keeps it flat,thus low volume
EDIT: but if there is enough demand, the powers that be will let it rally.
@_date: 2013-11-06 15:47:38
not on mine
@_date: 2013-10-13 19:05:48
Lost 10+ BTC on BTCjam.
@_date: 2013-10-16 08:44:56
The sooner we hit the big numbers the better, bitcoin needs enough market cap to stand on its own to feet and have a chance at protecting itself from everyone who is going to come after it. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 09:34:52
Does anyone have a list of all the cool places in berlin where I can spend some BTC
@_date: 2013-11-04 10:13:59
Hahahahaha people are still trying to withdraw on mt.gox. 
That is priceless
@_date: 2013-11-02 15:15:42
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:14:46
No, I am pretty sure he doesn't.
@_date: 2013-10-18 08:55:56
Pancakes! This is great, I live in Poland at the minute and REALLY fancy getting my hands on some of these, how many zl will this set me back? :)
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:10:05
He actually has a point, I got stung when I first got into BTC and had I not bought prior to the last bubble I would be a lot more upset at my 10btc loss.... but there ya go.
Getting into BTC can be dangerous because 99% of people who want to buy a currency, whatever currency that may be, don't care and shouldn't have to care about researching it. It should be fool proof.
@_date: 2013-10-15 16:28:22
Yes, when it hits 175 in the next few days, don't panic buy ;)
@_date: 2013-10-20 16:01:13
I cant tell you why but I dont trust that site, so I dont want my BTC there.
@_date: 2013-10-30 12:21:07
Good work
@_date: 2013-10-14 08:00:25
If you really want to risk your BTC, I HIGHLY recommend not using BTCscam.
You can risk your money for a lot less effort at coinlenders.com
Of course, it's only a test script.
@_date: 2013-11-06 15:43:06
The joke nazi's are out in force. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 16:18:16
48% ?
Doesnt sound like a lot when I look at the value of my BTC year on year.
@_date: 2013-10-15 18:46:59
Pretty funny question. If you can withdraw from mtgox then it means you have magic powers.
@_date: 2013-11-02 19:35:57
No need to commit, the good people who find fortune in bitcoin will no doubt be feeling charitable. Some will be of course be greedy. Thats it.
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:16:18


@_date: 2013-10-20 13:39:23
Hahahahahaha Now, maybe I am being foolish, but I am fairly certain nobody is desperate/stupid enough to risk having funds in Mt.Gox still after all the warnings in the last several months.
@_date: 2013-10-22 09:31:44
-10 somewhere in BTCJam Cyberspace!
@_date: 2013-11-01 09:35:57
You sound a bit paranoid... but yea, many people bought cheap, sold higher... then watched the price keep going up...
