OP's comment history
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:07:14
There is [2,5,7] in the whitepaper, which likely became 257

Isn't that someone sending BTC to the prize address, not from? Am I missing something? What does this prove?
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:27:23
Go through OP's comment history and you will find a link to the font that was used, shouldn't be too hard to check if any symbol in the whitepaper could not be printed
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:26:25
Are you sure that's an M and not a Σ ?
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:06:28
It hasn't been solved yet
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:42:33
Be ready to wait a looong time if this is your plan.
To answer your question posted a python [script]( that will do what you need. It needs to be updated to look for the new address though (line 7).
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:28:43
OP did post it but deleted it afterwards. He has not said anything about it so no way to know if it's a valid clue.

Would be pretty bad PR for their website if it's fake, assuming the account is legit.

There are 24! permutations to try if bruteforcing, not exactly trivial
@_date: 2018-05-20 12:56:54
Source might be [this]( it contains John at the bottom.
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:49:22
If this is the case, I think there will be some brute forcing needed, at least shifting order of words or something. How else would OP ensure that the puzzle would result in a valid BIP39 phrase?
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:26:32
Agreed, there are so many paths that could be correct and no way to know if you're on the right path until you reach the end. It just devolves into wild guessing. Sure, sooner or later someone will guess correctly, but it's pretty much a distributed bruteforce of the possible solutions.

Everyone of these leads to wallet, try them yourself
@_date: 2018-06-09 09:02:05
Yes it is, you created a new wallet.
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:31:43
Of course, my seeds are just generated by a program so they make no sense. But the point I was trying to make is that just because you found a seed that is logically coherent and fits in with puzzle clues, it doesn't mean that the seed is the correct one. There are probably many valid seeds that make sense from a human perspective, but you have to find the exact one that OP selected.
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:59:48
All valid mnemonic seeds gives you access to a wallet. The vast majority of wallets don't belong to anyone and have a balance of 0 because nobody has sent money to that wallet before.
In a 12 word seed there are 4 checksum bits, so on average every 16th 12 word seed you try will be a wallet. They are not rare.
