What are these ways in which you speak of?

I agree cashapp from Square.  Gemini unfortunately holds funds on ACHs like coinbase does which is like a week. Havent checked bittrex for fiat.  Thanks for the reply

Yeah I should've posted that. However it was yesterday morning as the price was around 9,100ish. USD. 
Bitcoin atm radar will sometimes show fee percentages but hardly ever does an atm post their markup or live btc prices. Just unfortunate. I'm sure it will change as they become more popular and someone can put out a reasonable atm which will be used much more than the unreasonable ones, forcing them to lower the markup.

Now if this atm didn't require kyc I could easily understand the premium.... but at that rate they have the balls to charge me essentially a tx fee?
And to reiterate my question. I'm not saying this is wrong for them to do. It's a free market and I am very much a free market guy. They can charge  100k for a btc if they want. However I've often heard the fact that bitcoin atms are showing up more and more around the states spun like it's good for bitcoin. Is it really though? If this is the experience?

Icing on the cake.... they just texted my government issued phone this link.

You guys, the 2$ fee is absolutely fine perhaps for the bitcoin network to function... look at the price in which the bitcoin was sold at..... my 120 dollars got me about 96 dollar in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-20 19:28:50
I agree. However there are a couple different company ownee atms in my area. All of which do not post price online. This was more a one time experience thing as I've held off for a long time for the reason mentioned, part of me also knew that the markup would be absurd so I'm not necessarily boo-hooing in any sense. Just a legitimate question posed in original post.

That's a fair statement,  centralization is not 'wrong'...  Unless its forced. Both have pros and cons.  It all comes down to different people wanting/needing different services. 
You can just do alot more with bitcoin than a bank account IF you have the technical know-how.  
Example you can create a Gmail account and email someone your private information. 
Or you can create a live bootable USB running linux tails,  generate pgp keys,  use a vpn,  run tor through bridges then create an account on an email server that does not store data or even irc that private information  encrypted,  virtually untraceable,  and have pretty good privacy. 
One method is harder and requires some research...  Both have pros and cons.  Many people do one or the other,  some use both...  
That being said,  I think problems like this will be solved as we explore all the possibilities with blockchain tech. 
Plus there are plenty of centralized btc/blockchain  services...  Some to  specifically prevent  problems like this...
