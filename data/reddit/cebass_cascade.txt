I’m more likely to buy at 9999, but hey I’ve watched my father work the stock market as an amateur for 40 years. It’s real there too.

BTC has brand power. I don’t see a lot of people bringing up that fact when they bash it.  Branding and the backing of the consumer through advantageous word of mouth can float a sub par platform long enough for it to be improved by competent people. They need to focus on security and user interface. Make it safer and easier and people will flock to it and the price will skyrocket. Someone else gets there first and it’s dead. Call it the 65 yr old Mom test.

It’s hard to cut that check isn’t it!!  As a small business owner I’m used to seeing money go OUT of my account each quarter. Hourly and salary employees don’t understand how much that hurts because they are used to just not ever seeing that money. It’s just theoretical to them. So when you get into an opportunity like crypto and have success, the pain of having to pony up to the GOV is excruciating. I have to admit I’ve enjoyed more than a little bit of schadenfreude over the last few weeks as people freak out over taxes. When you win, the GOV wins, when you loose, the GOV still gets their pound of flesh.

No, frankly I don’t. I’m not a crypto expert but I think some folks with big pockets saw opportunities and jumped on them last year and the market has moved in a direction they didn’t anticipate.  Construction takes 12-18 months, so they are committed at this point. That being said there are millions being invested, so they will at least ruin it for the at home level miners trying to recoup what they can.

Big mining ops starting up in Vegas and the PNW/Canada (Chinese $$ in Canada from what I hear) due to ultra cheap energy and lots of relatively cheap land. Been shipping backup generators to them for months now. Expect more big $$ to come in this year.
