Good points.
It seems like the best option (although maybe not the easiest to program logically) would be to split every "hop" into exactly the same size chunks (with a remainder).
For example:
* Person A wants to send 2 BTC
* Person B wants to send 0.25 BTC
* Percon C wants to send 1.5 BTC
The first hop would split all the coins into 0.25 BTC (for example) chunks/addresses and then work on giving the actual values to the desired end addresses.
This would make the list of "the bitcoin possibly went here" addresses much larger and hopefully a lot harder to find.
However, designing that system would possibly be more expensive (each hop to split into like-size chunks first), and you'd have to ensure no-one's money is meant to exit in this hop to reach its final destination, etc.
Lots of possible gotchas, but I wonder if this would be beneficial?

Oh wow. I hope no one is using this expecting any sense of anonymity then, that was way too easy.

In about 2 minutes from this post, ads have just started and the interview should be after the quick break.

You might find this to be useful: [Blockchain's Receive Payments API](
It looks pretty simple to implement and then you only need to add an input element for their email address to the payment submission form.

Good question; I can't find any references to NEO &amp; BEE on the zipzap sites, but that doesn't mean they're not involved.
I did find another more recent source with a relationship between NEO &amp; BEE and ZipZap here: 
Based on this, it looks like the answer to your question is yes, but it wouldn't be unwise to wait and see to believe it, like you say.
It's not too long to wait now anyway.

My understanding is it's pretty similar to a debit card, except works with the Bitcoin backbone through Neo&amp;Bee.

They might also see a very low conversion rate with this, which could do more harm than good.
If the advertisers say "We'll pay $0.01 per click" and they don't get many conversions (user signups) from it, they've paid out to the site, but they're not really benefiting from it.

I'm hoping it's not this easy (?).

No problem, just make sure you're using 2-Factor Authentication (2FA)  whenever you can (all the time), see a HTTPS certificate, and the domain is the right one, you shouldn't worry too much ;)
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:42:24
That should only be possible through something called [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)]( or [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]( Both of which are very basic in themselves and are pretty easy to protect against (at least XSS for sure).
Due to these attacks being so easy to do, it's likely they're already being protected against on those big exchanges. If they weren't, you'd probably know about it pretty quickly, and an exchange being vulnerable to such simple attacks would probably destroy their trust with users.
**TL;DR:** It's wise to be aware of and worry about an issue like you're suggesting, but in reality you should be perfectly safe as long as you see the green padlock in the URL (for HTTPS) and the domain name looks right.
It's always better to be safe and go through the site yourself though, as you can never fully trust anyone's link.
