I have been using this guy's program for a year (only just now discovered there have been updates). Works like a dream on 2 systems (two brands of 5850's).

Not all teens are good at computer. I can remember visiting many a shady emulator/warez/cracks/porn sites back in the day not knowing any better, loading up with trojans. Might be a good opportunity to teach them good security practices. Don't want to lose your wallet!

Per the article, the constitution allows for gold and silver coins to be minted, but not any paper/fiat currency.

Mine usually restarts on it's own, even under a minute sometimes, I mostly just found it odd. Plus one minute of downtime is potentially 3 shares for me :D

You are correct, and today CPU mining on any number of machines will net you a loss from your power bill. Only GPU's are efficient enough to come out ahead of their wattage, and even then you can still make more money faster by buying them.

nothing. But, why would anyone use D Harry coin? 
@_date: 2011-07-01 04:21:46
You're making the assumption people are calculating what's efficient for them, or that they are even aware they are mining (referring to recent BTC mining trojan). You could have millions of idiots spinning their CPU away for $10 a day in power and 4 khash/s. The difficulty won't just stop when the world runs out of ATI cards. Computers are always being replaced, even if they're e-machines in offices.
25% is even quite modest, historically.

transactions without fees already take hours or more to get a single confirmation. When it actually catches on, I would expect fee-less transactions to take a week or more. 
So no, it doesn't frighten me in the slightest that it's being taken out of the client. If CPU mining ever becomes viable again, just go get a CPU miner. 
If you're THAT concerned, wait until the block value becomes 25 and see what happens. We are already halfway there.

No but it does determine which transactions are included in the blocks it solves.

The guy needs to put up the affiliate portal on a second page; maybe an entirely different domain.  Neat that the cart is integrated though.

Bitcoinwatch.com's pool pie chart becomes really, really inaccurate following a difficulty change, which happened yesterday. Give it a couple of days and it will go back to normal. This happens every time the difficulty changes (the pie chart, as well as a post about it).

Hi, I'm late to the party, but wanted to throw in some extra tidbits:
the .01 transaction fee is the default only for transactions under .01 BTC. This is in place to help stop someone from flooding the network with tons of tiny transactions, but could potentially be removed (far) in the future should the common transaction be under .01 BTC.
Also, there is a maximum number of transactions that are included per block, so transaction fees will probably be dwarfed by new currency rewards for the next 30 years.

Go to the bitcoin.org forums marketplace board. There are people with good reputations there that will send you your choice of payment.
It may seem odd not going through a website, but it's worked well for me
@_date: 2011-10-30 18:01:40
there is *currently* no way to know an output address (or any address) is valid prior to sending. Hell, there is no way to know they are valid before they are re-spent a second time, then only concluding that the prior address must have been valid.
edit: in before someone figures it out

As for the repaying of a loan argument: who the fuck takes out a loan in BTC? The only reason banking &amp; loans work in USD is because they are federally backed. You can enforce a loan in a court of law. I doubt you can do that for bitcoin. 
Better argument against the loan problem: This happens in all currencies. If my USD drops in value during the 30 years it takes to pay off a mortgage, it's only an issue if i'm trying to repay my mortgage in a currency other than what I took out (or if i'm trying to sell my house for another currency)

Why isn't bitcoin creative commons? Or is it, and he is just doing some sort of lawyer magic?

This was what I was referencing:
Good mining hardware is expensive and is subject to diminishing returns as the network gets stronger. Buying BTC on an exchange may be a gamble, but the supply of dollars is going to increase faster than the supply of BTC. I got $20 worth at one point and cashed out for $100.
There are reputable bitcoin exchangers on the forums as well.

I like the personal stats and registration of deepbit, but I also like the simplicity and utter 'hack proof' luke-jr method of using the payment address as a username. That said, I joined your pool. Go reddit!
I'd also like the option of removing my email address. If you need to tell everyone something, you know where to find us :P

@_date: 2011-07-01 15:09:54
It was an exaggeration, but moot to my point; which was that with virii and single-click "start mining" webpages, people are not necessarily checking to see if their hardware is any good for mining before using it. 
The "worst" rig i could come up with still only burns ~$4 daily (using .15c for kwh)

At this point it would be easier to counterfeit paper currency than a bitcoin.

Someone working for Google is developing a java based bitcoin client, i'd presume for just that sort of purpose (since all the PC platforms have clients already)
@_date: 2011-03-24 05:05:02
I can answer the last three, since the first is more economics/personal?
* GPU mining is now the only type of mining expected to generate results. Even my 9800 GTX+ is only generating ~.30 BTC daily (in a pool)
* The longest chain is considered the correct one. To make a new chain, you'd have to start from block 1 of currently 114785, and a block takes, on average, 10 minutes to make. Then you'd have to outpace the swarm.
* Each copy of the client software validates the hash for each block on it's own. The hash must be lower than the current [target]( to be accepted. The relationship of these numbers is difficulty = minium_target / current_target. The difficulty is determined by examining the timestamps of the past 2016 blocks (not a moving average, it is done every 2016 blocks) by the clients and adjusting it based upon if blocks are being found too quickly or too slowly.

Therein lies the problem, 100% of bank transfers (ACH transactions, not debit or credit cards) in the united states are processed by and through the fed via an established bank (ex: Your acct -&gt; ODFI -&gt; Fed -&gt; RDFI -&gt; their acct.. though this is a bit oversimplified)
It may be feasible to have a distributed/p2p pricing system, but it is going to be really difficult if not impossible to legally (or illegally) process USD via bank transfer. Wherever/whoever interfaces with a US bank will always be a "point of failure" with sizable assets, subject to Know Your Customer laws, etc. 
Basically, you don't get access to the banking network without being shut-down-able.

I'd say it's more dangerous for the Merchant than the consumer. If you accept credit cards, and an employee (or anyone with access to the equipment, physical or wireless) compromises the credit card machine and steals your customer's numbers, you could be at-fault. This could open you up to possible civil litigation, and at the very least you'd be in trouble with your payment processor and card networks. Cards will reimburse their cardholders for stolen monies, but with bitcoins your customers will be staring directly at you, and in America, individuals can get very wealthy for being "stupid" or "careless" interacting with a business.

PULSE is Discover's debit card network, and debit card networks can handle any debit card (using PIN verification) regardless of issuer. That number likely includes a large swath of ATMs in addition to merchant point of sales nationwide.
We've already passed their credit card transactions.

More upvotes for this. Chargebacks are handled as a case and merchants are given the chance to rebuke them, and can be given MONTHS to do so. If they can come up with your signature, it will help their case a lot. If anything, the chargeback probably got you bumped up in line.
