The inversion is coming.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:54:02
Agreed bitcoin is bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:14:58
No, it's hard to time the swings and compete with the trading bots. For me holding is less stressful 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:46:29
They just haven't printed it yet
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:36:55
Lol. Because it's every dictators dream to have a borderless, decentralized form of money that they can't inflate.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:03:20
I couldn't agree more. Now we have a way to exit their corrupt system. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:36:09
Good job. I don't smoke but I did recently get my wife to start cutting my hair to save money.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:35:18
Some belters on there. I'm sure he's off somewhere throwing a tantrum. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:14:48
Historically Japan has been a nation of savers. In a fiat system savers are punished so it doesn't surprise me that they would see the value of btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:31:57
Same here
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:56:17
 I didn't read the fine print. Can someone tell me where it is?
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:31:52
How did you get your feelings hurt?
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:33:38
Imagine the bubble that will create

I'm looking forward to meeting him at one of the meet and greets for patreon donors.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:58:54
Your entitled your opinion but dont confuse them with empirical evidence. None of your so called emperical arguments can be verified or proven wrong, so there's nothing empirical about them. Also, If you're going to make snarky comments like, "Let me guess you are a libertarian and think that markets are efficient" you come across as an arrogant, condescending wanker.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:17:58
That is awesome. Made my day
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:45:21
I missed that. Too busy looking at the girls arse
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:31:31
Bitcoin will accelerate the downfall of the current system and probably be blamed. I already treat the dollar as if we are in the middle of an Austrian "crack up boom". 
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:39:49
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:47:08
How long before cars fly?
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:07:32
Let me guess you think central planning is efficient?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:59:12
I'm already a patreon subscriber. I've learned so much from andreas it I felt compelled to support his work.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:47:27
Good going. Most people aren't that responsible.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:27:21
What's this? I thought this reddit was about price memes. Could at least have said "Lightning Integration Tests! 75/75 passing!" to the moon.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:51:18
Are you taking the piss?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:50:35
Agreed. I hope your planning your exit strategy if you haven't left already. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:27:25
Can you exchange crypto for fiat on there?
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:07:37
Wow I'm surprised they're catching on that quickly. The answer is yes.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:51:01
Well done. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:51:09
People are filled with greed. Bitcoin is neutral.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:45:05
Oh well you can't help everyone. Don't let the critics get to you. You're not dumb.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:51:08
I think you should consider the value of all the asset classes and not just money supply. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:00:58
Can a bank be diagnosed with bipolar disorder? It's a scam no wait it's an emerging asset class. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:41:37
Bitcoins not a currency? Some one better tell ledger. I used it to pay them for my nano s.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:10:11
We're never going to agree because you think statistics are facts and that econometrics is actually science. I don't. Goodbye and peace to you.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:51:14
People are filled with greed. Bitcoin is neutral.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:37:06
The biggest issue I have with bitcoin is trying not to be jealous of people who got in that early. I'm working on it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:52:35
I've been a patreon supporter of Andreas for about a month. I've learned so much from his talks I felt compelled to support him.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:06:18
Yup, you don't want to have the alphabet boys kicking your door in.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:32:21
Exactly. Need to stay current
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:54:36
That's my goal too
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:56:29
Nah, Putin has him in there to make his election appear legit. He's pulling all the strings. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:21:05
Might as well get used to it guys the herd is coming. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:21:35
Depends on your time frame. If you may need the money again soon, you probably should just keep it as cash. If you plan on keeping the btc for years I say buy it. I wouldn't let what your parents think influence the decision. I'm sure they have your best interests at heart but btc is about self sovereignty. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:54:28
Well done.
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:38:42
I don't care how he defines bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:01:04
It could be. The problem with central bank policies, as it relates to this post, is distortion of asset prices. Admittedly not the only factor.
@_date: 2018-05-11 13:26:52
Forget lambos. I want my own hollowed out volcano lair.
@_date: 2018-05-03 19:24:41
Agreed. Hopefully, By enabling people to better their lives, bitcoin will spur an African rennaisance. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:42:53
It's good news. They're helping to dig their own grave.

What a loser!
@_date: 2018-10-18 14:36:22
I wouldn't want to spend an extra satoshi for a personalized license plate.
@_date: 2018-10-24 14:55:07
Yes! bobble is the new hodl.

If it hits $1 million, I'd expect that a large part of that would be massive usd inflation. It would be ugly.
@_date: 2018-06-23 14:57:21
I think TA can work bc you're  competing against other people who think it can work. Therefore, some one in that game will come out on top, but the majority lose money. I don't trade so maybe I'm talking out my ass.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:31:31
Bittie mae, lol. That's a belter 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:09:51
Shows how centralised 2x would have been.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:24:00
File this one under the "no shit, Sherlock" category.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:47:25
I wanted to exit the warfare/welfare state. Still working on it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:42:16
Couldn't agree more. ��
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:03:38
Not at all. Glad you're here.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:43:25
We're people this mental when it went from 5k to 3k after China news?
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:12:12
Hopefully we'll see the federal reserve building converted into apartments!
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:29:17
By years end��
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:40:04
Just did a double take at the btc price. Now I know why. ☺
@_date: 2019-02-07 16:44:57
It's great that they have this option now. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:44:40
Panics aren't rational
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:27:53
Welcome to the club.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:20:17
I'm with you. My 10 stone bullmastiff/presa canario won't fit in a tesla!
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:35:31
Congrats. If I could go back to 2010 I'd get my wife a cheaper ring and buy btc with the money instead.
@_date: 2019-04-28 22:53:11
Soo side, ya bass!!
@_date: 2019-04-22 19:09:08
Yes. The hardest money wins.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:11:02
There's a lot of pure speculation in btc. However, unlike comic books or beanie babies you can use btc to transfer value peer to peer anywhere in the world. I think that gives it value among other things.
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:58:04
This debt will never be paid. They'll print and print until the system collapses.
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:33:47
When in doubt Andreas it. ��
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:36:54
Does that include lambos.
@_date: 2018-03-15 21:56:16
Who cares
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:29:49
Here we go again. Austrian v Keynesian battle royale Let's get ready to rumbllllle!
@_date: 2018-03-04 16:44:03
I read somewhere once about a saying they have in s.a. about being 10 years behind Zimbabwe. Land confiscation and hyperinflation, sounds like Zimbabwe alright.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:31:54
I'm sure the plans for the invasion to liberate the people of Venezuela are already drawn up. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:10:20
I bought a little yesterday in addition to my regular monthly purchase. Hodling with you.
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:45:35
I hope he keeps believing this for as long as possible.
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:01:08
True. However, you don't have to pass new legislation to write regulations. Govt agencies propose new regs all the time.
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:20:55
Might actually be a better use of the money than a 4 year degree.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:33:54
There a pretty good explanation of this phenomenon in the book "dumbing down".
@_date: 2018-07-23 18:05:36
I think WaPo is a bat verified content provider.
@_date: 2018-07-02 13:37:31
Congratulations. We need more bitcoin babies
@_date: 2018-07-27 13:49:44
Exactly there'll be an etf when goldman sachs &amp; jp morgan want one. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 13:53:48
Because he's one of the few people in Venezuela not on the "Maduro" diet.
@_date: 2018-07-27 13:52:02
Scary and tragic.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:52:39
Welcome to bitcoin club. This is the peaceful project mayhem. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:20:35
Lol. Enough said.
@_date: 2018-04-30 00:03:24
"It needs a new narrative". Where do they find these muppets.
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:47:33
A rare Reddit apology. My compliments to you.
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:24:19
These predictions are just entertainment. Although I do take Draper more seriously than your average bitcoin to the mooner.
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:50:44
I was picturing bitcoin sign guy popping up behind him.
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:19:23
Disbelief on the cusp of hopeful.
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:44:23
Every time btc goes up now I think it's a bull trap. That's as close as I'll get to capitulating. I still buy what little btc I can afford on the 1st of every month and I'm still hodling.
