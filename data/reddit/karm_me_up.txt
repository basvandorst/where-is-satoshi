is there a video of how it actually works?
Anonymity in Germany?  I doubt it.
@_date: 2019-12-12 21:34:13
would this do the job?
@_date: 2019-12-08 02:47:25
its up to the mods.

@_date: 2019-12-21 18:28:48
There is a reason I ask!!  I was not sure.
@_date: 2019-12-18 08:43:57
because this community is very serious about security and most users are really kind.

@_date: 2019-12-07 08:35:04
its ok. I understand the Caps showing urgency in this case.
I wonder why some user(s) support the instructions on the PM I got.
@_date: 2019-12-10 14:42:39
sure, tell me more about it.  Clearly, you know what you are writing about.
@_date: 2019-12-10 07:49:51
this is not Socialism
Socialism is Germany, Norway, Finland, Sweden and many others.
Stop believing the American narrative, please.
Having said that, Venezuela is fucked up for other reasons, we can agree on that.

I need an ELI5, like for a baby.
Some users are very technical, this info is for my Grandmother  :P  
(it is for me of course)
@_date: 2019-12-12 21:29:21
how do I reset that without screwing it up?


@_date: 2019-12-20 13:07:45
I got 2 bank accounts, my main account gives me only headaches.
I could not even pay for my REVOLUT card with my main (and soon to be EX-) bank.
So I got the second one which is not making me any stress with REVOLUT nor Bitcoin.
Having said that, I can take about 500€  A MONTH (in Bitcoin) out to my Ledger, and I have to do that for fear of them blocking my money.
If they block my account, Im basically fcked.
@_date: 2019-12-13 22:45:53
thanks so much!!
will try, not that i get it immediately.
and wtf with the o in coinbase?!
@_date: 2019-12-07 08:41:47
Why are "some" users supporting this in the comments??
Honest question to admins: Are you kicking off people who obviously are advocating unsafe practices?
@_date: 2019-12-18 08:23:12
thanks, and if you lose your phone? do you get all your passwords back and how?
a regular GoogleBackup?  (in not very tech-y) or what is your backup for the backup of your passwords?
@_date: 2019-12-01 10:41:55
@_date: 2019-12-12 22:04:05
the only I care about are my Kraken ones for every possible move
so just kraken and then 1 by 1, disable and re-enable?
@_date: 2019-12-07 08:11:54
I would like the Admins to ban that 8 year old account.... from ALL of Reddit.
Of course, its not up to me  XD

@_date: 2019-12-07 08:26:34


yeah, why a PM if this helps everyone, why not post the comment public?
@_date: 2019-12-07 08:37:19
Woah!! downvoted!! the post with a legit question which might help others, how is this happening?
@_date: 2019-12-07 08:32:44
I just dont trust anything that requires me to put my Seed anywhere other than my OWN Ledger.
why would you support a comment that asks people to post their seed on an HTML document saved to your computer?  Like those offline websites can't communicate with the internet (at some point).
can you comment on that?  thanks and peace, lets be civilized. No personal animosity. ok?
@_date: 2019-12-18 09:23:18
what about BitWarden?
just asking.
@_date: 2019-12-07 08:20:57
~~I like your tone. /not~~   &lt;-- sorry  
@_date: 2019-12-07 08:52:27
Its more about the PM, so that people realize that some Redditors which can type words that seems "trustful" should not pay attention to them and maybe even expose them.
After a PM, you are on your own, there are no other Redditors to comment about it. 
I agree with you of course, thanks.
@_date: 2019-12-10 14:46:36
tell me about Norway and Sweden and Germany now please.
and stop watching Fox News.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:49:33
Once I had a bunch of BTC, I got in "late", at 600€.... then it went up to 700€ and I was happy, a week later it went down to 200€... I was crushed.
Then bought and sell like crazy until I got my initial investment back, went on vacation. 
Now I regret I didn't hodl.
This time, Im not selling, only buying!
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:41:04
they send you bitcoin, you deposit to Paypal, then you take your deposit back since it is possible, and get to keep the Bitcoin.... 
Hope not one Redditor fells for this one.
