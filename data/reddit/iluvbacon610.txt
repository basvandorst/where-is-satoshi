As they say, "The name of the game is in the claims" People shouldn't be quoting from the spec as the spec actually provides very little legal protection down the road.

This is why you use limit buy and limit selling. You sell and buy at exactly the price you want. You liked Bitcoin at 16k but don't like it now at 15k? What changed? If your answer is the price changed you need to GTFO out and never look back because this clearly isn't the sector for you.

Examiners can only exercise judgment on what they have. You have proof of the claim language being in literature or in use before the filing date? Go submit it and get the patent invalidated. Examiner's can't just say things are obvious, no patent granted. They have to prove it.

Read the claims, Find literature that either reads on the claims or a combination of literature that would make the claims obvious. All the literature must have a filing date or publication date that is before the date of the patent in question. If you can not find the literature that is how they end up with the patent.

Look at the claims and then find literature before their filing date that exactly describes those procedures. While yes other systems like this might of already been in place but an Examiner wouldn't have access to those since most likely the company keeps the exact coding private. It will most likely be resolved when BoA sues somebody who then proves that they had been doing it that way since before the filing date of the patent.
