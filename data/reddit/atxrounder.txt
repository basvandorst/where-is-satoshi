Does anyone have input on HR835? I keep seeing ads and such regarding this event on Dec 30 re HR835 and how it effects Bitcoin and crypto. Can't find anything searching Reddit.

Bitcoin breaks down into millionths right?  Which means there will be, aside from the lost coins, 2.1e+13 total bits after all coins are mined.  This might take a while.

How many years before critical mass adopts a Jaxx wallet or the like?  I had heard of Reddit, but never got involved until I started investing in Crypto.  I'm not alone.

Happened to my coworker.  6.3 BTC and more.  Thankfully he had his seed words and a new Trezor hooked him up.  Scared the fuck outta him though.

Is this your opinion or do you have something to back that up? What about my wife who is both a Colombian and US Citizen?
