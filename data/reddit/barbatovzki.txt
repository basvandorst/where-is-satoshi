So if i want to secure my bitcoin, with private keys, i have to pay a fee to Coinbase, is it high?

Thanks mate!

Yes, But because the price is low, and Just like any crypto currency people Will try it out, and this is way more trustable then crypto currencies who Just came out thin air. So i think it wil go up a lot in the beginning. When the new btc flops this obviously doesnt happen

Where Will it be? On the paper wallet? And how can You get that off

 I know i am going to hodl Ferrari MOON and stuff, But it is more profitable if i buy more in a dip, and the dip Just happened, so are there any events coming december or januari that wil cause a dip or a peak

But if You have btc on Coinbase, and the fork happens, Will i get the btcx2 too?or whatever its called?

But if the coin starts very low, there isn't a high risk, only a risk of losing a small amount of money against the odd of making lots of money
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:21:28
So it starts at $0,50?
Then buying 200 of those coins can become very profitable with only $100 risk or Not?
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:30:37
So it is profitable,
And next to that, bitcoin is now possible again in China, Will the price of bitcoin go up?
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:25:02
I didn't say btc Will flop, i think it Will survive the fork, But i think segwit will grow, they expect it to start at $0,50 and i don't believe it Will stay this low
