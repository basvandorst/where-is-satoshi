I'd rather not let my bank know.  I don't trust banks.
@_date: 2017-02-09 01:38:08
It is. Thank you. I think I'll just buy with my cc over the next few weeks until I hit my number.
@_date: 2017-02-01 23:25:10
good to know.  ty
@_date: 2017-02-21 21:58:33
So true. They don't listen.  
@_date: 2017-02-09 06:51:26
I use credit cards.  I just dont want my bank to know.  Different bank than my cc

That sounds like a good idea.  I mean, I don't want to spend $100 on Trezor and wait four days for it to be mailed to me...unless..they take payment in bitcoin.

I have, however they charge $100 for the hardware.  I mean, I guess that makes sense, because you can't put a price on protecting your btc.  I just want to make sure I have both privacy and pub keys to it, and seed if needed
@_date: 2017-02-01 23:33:52
Exactly.  I'm not trying to a couple hundred thousand in bitcoin.....yet ;)

No way the USA makes btc  illegal for two solid reasons.
1. It gives business owners a whole new way to hide all their money and not pay taxes.
2.  Japan is set to recognize it as a currency April 1st of this year. If history has taught me anything, it's that when the Japanese do something first... the US follows suit like a puppy.   Btc is already being offered as an investment on the USAA website

I think I took this pic in 4028 to be exact

I spend a little, but I hodl 90%

Exactly.  You can't run in with a gun and rob a pot store that accepts digital currency.
