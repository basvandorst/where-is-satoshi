If we were ALL using GPUs, we would reach a balance at the same wattage, but would be much more decentralized than today.

Mining by encrypting is how bitcoin is born an also is the root of many problems. Mining results in unnecessary asic competition and waste of energy. If we all slow mining down by 99%, we would save 99.99% energy while keeping the same distribution of coins.

I did a quick search. People say each node maintains its own mempool. So transactions dropped by one node can still be in another. Check blockr.io and blockchain.com.

It was such an enlightening pizza, totally worth.

I have one pending for a couple days already, and blockchain.info has pruned my transaction from mempool. Was paying 0.0001/kb fee. I thought that wasn't too bad since the spammers paid less but the spammers' transaction went into the block but mine didn't. It's so clear who the spammers are.

What would happen if the internet divides into 2 disconnected ones? Two bitcoins? The one with lower difficulty will die if the networks merge again?
@_date: 2016-06-23 14:41:33
Offer better services or lower tax/tx rates to stay competitive.

Nice to know. Had we had 1M transactions in 1block, it would cost 1/10 kWh per transaction. Also we save on the military force needed to enforce dollar dominance.

You are making many different arguments


A good idea never die. A good idea is more likely to have support than bad ones. The action of forcing people to look at your idea doesn't make your idea better, and is unethical.


information about significant issues in the bitcoin space.
If you agree that bitcoin XT and bitcoin are different entities, posting xt in bitcoin is like saying you post dogecoin in bitcoin. And splitting the subs is a common practice. 
If you don't, then I would like to stress that XT does not follow bitcoin release process and is not approved by devs; XT implements BIP101 which is under review and more than that. XT is not a fork of bitcoin, XT FORKS bitcoin, so forks the subs.
If you want freedom experience, go through democratic discussions of bitcoin releases and stick with it, then we have one bitcoin, not two. Now XT already breaks this, and want Core to stick with this system so they can break again? 
Someone breaks the rule already, now we already have two.


You want to say something not approved should all make their own implementation and fork bitcoin? I agree it could be a valid decision making process, but we as a community haven't agreed or even talked about such a system.


Even voting will need discussions back and forth like what's happening right now. You mean ask someone to dictate and make an instant decision?


Who initiates? One dev? Two devs? Majority of devs? Majority of community? Entire community?
Put what? Proposal? Proposal implementation? Whole wallet implementation? Implementation with a bomb at the deadline?
Who vote?
You are trying to skip the basic definitions and just say it's the right thing to do. Then I think you mean all of these are right. 
Yes we already have the dev proposal voting procedure, but XT doesn't like it and breaks it which is how this problem starts. So apparently XT is against your point.
Also you can create a wallet, implement a whole lot of things so people couldn't understand in 1 month, pay many influential internet medias to say it's a better wallet while being shady about what else are in it and when 50% of people adopt in a month you create a hard fork and try to harvest those who adopted?
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:12:30
Urgh, but you also said the first hard fork should not contain too many changes etc. I completely agree with that. 
Somehow Gavin wasn't able to lead the plan, but rather executed the plan.
@_date: 2015-08-15 06:41:11
I'm pretty confident that the 50% attack bar can be raised to very, very high by somehow asking multiple miners to sign or encrypt the same block. These deficits will be solved. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 01:18:26
We're not on a debate anymore, things already happened; The debate is not in the bitcoin community, but in users themselves. We're in the state of war, with two teams fighting for audience. Whoever have the trick to get audience win. Merchants or politicians?
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:32:44


I guess the process of decision making on the "vote" protocol by two devs without consent from other devs came earlier and is much worse than dividing the subs to core and xt. 
Now even when bitcoin has potential ahead, the impulsive and selfish decision making process is not going to carry us to its potential. I saw proposals being openly proposed and discussed and implemented, I was confident we will reach there. But now with XT drama, it strikes me how childish some devs are.
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:24:49
This "vote" causes trust problems and price drops, and one party decide how and when. It's not fair and has caused damage. It should end quickly to prevent further damage
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:33:57
Larger block=less transaction fees=more transaction tax for bitpay=less mining income. Just sayin
@_date: 2015-08-20 05:23:12
If XT's call was to increase block size to 1.01mb or even 1gb it would've been easy. It wants to implement a not well reviewed protocol called BIP101, bundled with other things. Not backward compatibleNow all sorts of things already happened, everyone's sad.It's not a problem of who's better, it's who's going to deal less damage.
@_date: 2015-08-28 01:49:04
Literally right after the transaction spam, there were messages around on increasing the number of nodes.
Should nodes vote or should miners vote or should wallet runners vote? By IP or by hashing power or by the confirmations or what?
As a bitcoin user I don't feel I'm contributing much though.
@_date: 2015-08-20 05:51:32
What shapes this community is trust. When someone do things that harms this trust, we have to reflect and take measures, to ensure similar things won't happen again. Either bitcoin or xt will be gone. For less damage we have the urge to settle that down now. A roadmap needs to be there for scalability improvements. And more importantly is how to achieve distributed decision making or in the worst case elect whoever going to do the management work among the devs and users and this xt drama should never happen again
@_date: 2015-08-20 01:07:16
Users never know what they need, programmers/salespeople tell them ;)
Bitcoin is not the hostage, human mind is.
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:01:33
U know XT BIP101 is not compatible with core right? Does core have the obligation to be compatible with every alternative protocol? Satoshi's proposal assumes there's one common protocol. So only one compatible protocol can exist. Either 100% BIP101 or 0%.
@_date: 2015-08-22 04:09:57
The thing is it's not being repeated, and block size doesn't stop someone who want to break the network; unless that someone was attacking for raising the block size for his interest
@_date: 2015-08-20 00:06:59
Cmon guys, banks and politicians studying blockchain... transaction spam last month... default transaction fee raised... sidechain argument... blocksize argument... Snowden talking about bitcoin... and bam XT drama. 
Something's not right here. I wouldn't even be surprised if social media was taken over. 
It's hard to hit the right balance between faith and decentralization.
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:07:32
If we can't agree on anything, it's because we're stupid enough to overlook other people's opinions. So get smart. Silencing people wont get us further
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:51:08
Why should they implement bip101 instead of alternatives? Who set the deadline, who set how to vote? Why should our community participate a vote enforced by 2 people? If NSA forces a vote for whether some NSA improvement to speed up the network should be implemented and we vote?
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:07:41
I guess you didn't even think about WHY the network was full of blocks and not anymore, and didn't check how many proposals are out there improving scalability and why XT tries to fork.
@_date: 2015-08-20 05:29:21
I don't understand why some problem not going on right now needs to be immediately solved. Just because someone brought it up, or just because people want to see it solved? We haven't even reviewed all solutions yet
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:23:26
Freedom to have different opinions also. It's a good sub. But why don't xt make a xtcoin and just copy over btc blockchain? Why do the devs hijack bitcoin?

To those coin nerds apparently they were trying to use blockchain to store the reddit posts. 
It's an amazing idea isn't it. Sad that didn't came through. Reddit is a small company and probably could not afford the R&amp;D.

U know devs love their new ideas and would happily sacrifice u for incorporating their new ideas. It's called thinking FOR the users.

Today I was randomly thinking, how can a company survive when the data it gets overwhelms the actual business of maintaining a community. We as users can only hope that the company holds its words and won't leak our privacy to malicious parties; But as data scientists it's really a pain in the ass to check if your co-workers did bad things when analyzing data, and there would easily be enough commercial interest for them to do so. When such a company switches its interest from building a community to selling data for billions, it's really advancing into an uncharted territory. Twitter is a perfect example of that. 
@_date: 2015-11-24 07:25:42
It costs surprisingly little to maintain a site. The real problem is the OPPORTUNITY cost is big. If you sell the entire hard drive you instantly go from a nerd to a millionaire.

Robots can do creative work:  . It's not clear how much human involvement is needed. 
Also it is more efficient for a genius to do the creativity job. It's likely that at some point we'll have to "download" the genius' brain to survive using like you said a VR brainwasher. At that point are we still ourselves? Even if "we" have jobs, do we have jobs?
