The issue is that Facebook has a monopoly on the internet in most third world countries. 
They are the internet in those places.

Hello dear sir or madam, I am a Nigerian prince who is in need of your help. My governmental funds are currently locked in Euro's and the UN is not allowing me access to them till I go to court and show the documentation needed as proof, but I cannot afford a lawyer and no one will represent me. Will you please send me some Bitcoins so that I can transfer them into what ever currency we Nigerians use. I will gladly pay you back tenfold once I am embiggened with my money again.
Sincerely the ever Cromulent,
Prince Boostmane of Nigeria, Africa, Earth

I will rename my sons from Click-Click-Om'billy to ToolOfUncleSam! I can finally hire a legion of Lawyers with this money! You should marry my daughter the Lady Asica, but the marriage certificate for a Nigerian Princess is substantial and paying for the ceremony will cost at least three elephants worth of bitcoins. Once paid for the Elephants and their young can be converted into [Oliphaunts]( and we can raid the European embassy in Nigeria and free all my money once and for all. All I would need is money for elephant food now, and of course the purchasing price for the elephants and the fee to convert them into a Tolkienian nightmare.
Verily yours,
Prince Boostmane of Nigeria, Africa, Earth, [Sector 2814](
^thanks ^for ^getting ^my ^joke, ^and ^thanks ^for ^the ^tip ^&lt;3

$1000 per coin when scarcity is more common. 
People don't really realize how amazing it is to have a currency that is out of the governments hands! Quite frankly its the speculators that are fucking shit up, and I wonder how long that'll last, and if their actions have harmed bitcoins rise in the short term. 
In the long term, as bitcoins become harder to get, and governments keep debasing their own currencies, bitcoin will find it self in the public's heart, because looking at the shit that happend in Cyprus, and whats happening now in the US with quantitative easing aka ramming inflation up peoples asses, bitcoin will come out on top, or something similar in nature, should bitcoin receive too much negative press.

Exactly because globally there has been instability in government back currencies, looking at you Euro's. Hell, even the dollar has been fucked up so many times, bretton woods agreement, quantitative easing.
Bitcoins being a crypto-currency carry the added value of being money that cannot just be taxed at random.
I don't have many bitcoin(like $.90 worth actually lol) but I still hope for its success even though I don't have any money to invest in it, because I see it's freeing nature!

We don't want the government involved in internet protection, then we need to find an Open source way to do it otherwise they will protect our asses into hell... 
Cannot let this become the reason we lose our "free" internet, hopefully someone is brainstorming how we can fight back as a collective.
