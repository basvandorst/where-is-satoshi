Part of the library is still at Dropbox, the rest is at Github (we're slowly transferring the whole library to GitHub).
Take a look at this service: [
You just pass the URL of your HTML file at GitHub as a parameter and it serves the current online version of your book.
We are currently considering to create a tool which would convert the book to ePub, Mobi and PDF formats whenever the GitHub file is changed.
**Edit:** We're currently using wkhtmltopdf, gepub ruby gem and kindlegen for converting HTML to PDF, ePub and Mobi.

There are proofreaders in our network who will cheerfully accept Bitcoin for their services. I guess it's not impossible to pay for the cover art in Bitcoin as well.
Then there are some USD only services like OCR, but my modest estimate is that two-thirds of the expenses can be easily paid in Bitcoin.
Thanks for the question.

Let's say we lose a Bitcoin. We can learn from our mistake, keep using the payment system and still be smarter then before losing it.
While when we lose a thousand bucks on PayPal (Fraudulent Chargebacks, Frozen Account...) and keep using the payment system, then the next time it's not a mistake but a choice.
We'll take our chances with Bitcoin.

The closest I got to finding a suitable platform for a distributed proofreading was with [CrowdCurity]( (cool platform and great people behind the service, but their "bounty platform is purely focused on security testing" and would probably not accept our application).
We'd love to have "a cool tool that tells you which page to read". Unfortunately, we don't.
We are doing it for fun so we don't have the resources needed to create such tool (though would definitelly join an opensource project with a similar scope).
In case you'd like to help out in the project, share the library with your friends and followers. No rights reserved, so happy reading, sharing, editing and selling!
**edit: TL;DR:** Can't wait to read and would not mind a beer tip? Choose a random book from the library and have fun!

1 [ChangeTip]( beer, which is $3.50 worth of bitcoin (don't ask me why).
Good hunting!

Thank you, hope you'll enjoy the library once it's published.
Edit: I've just transferred it to the campaign's wallet.
Edit+: confirmed

You can import [this]( file into your calendar application; it should create a recurring event in your calendar and every month you will be notified by your calendar application together with a Bitcoin URI. Clicking on it should fire up your default Bitcoin wallet with a pre-filled address, suggested amount, etc.

**P** and **E** from *payments*,  **A** and **N** from *donations*, **U** from *recurring*, and **T** and **S** from *tips*. *PEANUTS*, or **Peanuts**. It kind of made sense when we've talked about it. Sorry you don't like it. Any better ideas for the project's name?
@_date: 2016-01-18 09:05:13
Not yet, this is just a proof of concept. Now that we know it works and at least some of you like the idea, we can polish the library, create a "Recurring transaction" button builder, and then we can create a product video.
Thanks for your time and insight.
@_date: 2016-01-17 18:50:56
We will set up a GitHub Page for the project featuring different use cases of the library ("Donate every month" button builder, a jQuery module ...).
Thanks for your time and insight.

Yeap, you are right. I've added the simplest complete piece of code and will create a sample form, that will allow the visitors to set an amount of BTC they want to send, how often, on which day, set their own messages etc.
This kind of feedback is why we've published it once we had a working prototype of the library.
It's not intended for non-programmers right now. (1) It's just a JavaScript library that makes it easier to create an iCalendar document that anyone can import to their own calendar application. Therefore, it's decentralized (you can have a complete control over your BTC, without sharing your private key) (2).
(3) It's kind of a replacement for recurring PayPal donations. It's not automated so you still have to confirm the transaction (though you don't have to remember when, to whom, and how much to send every week/month/year etc.).
(4) Now that we know there might be demand for an easy to use "Donate every month" button, we can start working on it.
Thanks for your time and insight.

We've felt in love with the name immediately and did not think about alternatives since.
This is still just a proof of concept, though it'd make us happy if it inspires someone to create a more elegant solution for decentralized recurring transactions which is something the Bitcoin ecosystem would definitely find a use for.
Thanks for the compliment, I guess. =)
@_date: 2016-02-08 07:41:43
This is just a reference implementation. An iCalendar document can hold more than one (recurring) event. Though the template is not prepared for it quite yet (we'd have to add two lines to it), you can create a document with an arbitrary number of unique payment URIs for anyone who downloads a calendar (not an elegant solution, I know).
We'd like to extend Peanuts with templates for RSS/Atom and CRON, so you can use a custom way of notifying the user together with a unique URI.
Thanks for your time and feedback.
**Edit:** The URI can identify a location instead of Bitcoin payment. This location would give you a unique transaction details every time. Pros: a unique address for every transaction. Cons: one more action is needed every time to make a transaction and it'd not be as decentralized as the current solution.

Not much we can do about the name (we can make it more clear that it's the markup language now that I think about it).
We've chosen Liquid for it's nice features and family of implementations. You can take one template and use it on almost [any]( major web platform.
Thanks for clarifying the Liquid/Liquid issue for us.
@_date: 2016-02-08 08:04:46
Thanks for your kind words. It's all we wanted it to be: (1) decentralized so you don't have to give up your coins to a third party, (2) platform agnostic and based on standards, and (3) finally finished (the MVP part anyway).
