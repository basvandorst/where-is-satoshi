No lie, you kinda sound like a money launderer lol

This made the front page of Reddit!! Hell yeah!

I thought all of these things required ID? The two I used did at least. Crazy to think I could essentially go perform a local bitcoins transaction via an iron box. Why did I not know about this? Surprised they let it go on this long lol
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:21:18
I am confused. You had to fingerprint? When I used it I needed to scan my hand print. The second time I used it I only needed my phone, which I was pretty happy about. If you ever want to offload coins just use local bitcoins. I usually use these machines when I want to buy anyways.

Damn. Props on the informative write up. If I had btcs I'd tip ya
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:15:23
This is hysterical!

I think you have a rage posting problem. Did your gold fish die recently?
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:44:34
Hahaha I thought the same thing
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:41:08
Can't shit in the oatmeal... oh wait
@_date: 2013-12-13 09:29:03
I agree, very awesome
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:27:15
Good idea, I dig it. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:11:07
I think 1k on bit stamp will be the low. It's self correcting pretty hard right now, up $40 down $40... ya know
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:36:35
That's awesome didn't know that, thanks! 
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:07:06
Not quite... I got in low&amp; still in it for the long haul.
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:39:03
40m people watched the lol world championship this year. You think that was all 10-12 yr olds? Ignorant
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:15:37
Well how do we change it?

I second this motion
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:32:12
But they would probably throw it away at such a small amount
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:45:12
Yes the above post is correct. When I transact I try to give .001 in fees. Then again I usually trade +1btc so the fees aren't a huge deal. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:58:09
gotta love the sarcasm
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:00:02
I'm tripping on acid
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:21:23
What is cringe?
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:44:26
How did I not catch that lol!!
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:05:22
Def wasn't "begging" for votes, which I think is obvious. But, once again looks like the trolls are ahead on this one...
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:39:41
Fuck you Apple for trying to tell us what we need... you've been doing it for far too long. Power to the people!
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:30:06
Well there are 40+ peeps in the class, I need all the help I can get. But I've kinda ruled out giving each person some Btc. It was a noble idea but not feasible.  
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:54:02
Can you provide a link for this"hedge fund" scenario I keep hearing about?
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:37:41
Just let the meds take effect.....

I love the fact that you said rinky dink
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:43:46
If this were to come true I'd be moist. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:18:31
Yeah, I haven't seen it like this before. Kinda worried
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:49:35
Jk I'm broke
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:29:56
Im gonna cuddle you so hard during this tough journey

League has more exposure than value by far. It's the most played game in the world and had 40m viewers during the world championships. That's almost 1/3 the viewers of the super bowl. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:58:24
Buy buy buy buy!!!

A wise man once told me, it is not the amount of fiat that is important, but rather the amount of bitcoin. With that in mind, today has been just like any other day, except I got a few extra coins on the cheap cheap.
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:17:08
I was there, I remember. I got in at the $600 drop from $900. Oh how I hope history repeats itself
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:27:08
Yep, still zero =/
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:03:18
Bravo good sir

I've been thinking about getting into LTC mining myself. What will be the ROI on your new rig? 
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:12:19
Is anyone under the age of 35 considered to be a "kid" on this post? Are you so ignorant that because it's a video game it must only be played by children? gtfo
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:12:21
That's like saying if I had "LMNBROS" or "FANYMAY"as my plate in 2008 people would think I was a crook. Oh wait...
