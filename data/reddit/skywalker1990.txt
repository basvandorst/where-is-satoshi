Discussing bitcoin price is no longer allowed on this sub?

I did buy a few months earlier... I just like to be pessimistic to maybe do a little anti-jinx.
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:50:58
Is there somewhere else I should go for bitcoin speculation?
@_date: 2015-12-05 13:26:35
The same thing is true with the stock market right?

They said approximately 2 weeks until Gemini.... Buying time

So are we going to wait for liftoff for a few more months?
@_date: 2015-06-29 14:04:33
Is this the real deal? Is it finally happening?
@_date: 2015-06-20 03:22:59
Is this a bitcoin joke?

Sorry to ruffle everybody's feathers around here. I rarely ever post, but I see $250 as a big milestone. It is one that if it can maintain above $250 we should see a nice turn in the price.

It's too bad they waited until it's too late...
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:09:25
If you plan on holding for a couple years then yes of course!
@_date: 2015-05-20 21:58:16
Is it already over? That was short-lived...
@_date: 2015-05-20 22:05:26
Ah ok, thanks. I watch the Senate never.

Not sure how these people are having such a hard time understanding.

If you believe buy now and the rest doesn't matter.
@_date: 2015-07-19 02:01:07
I love these people... They always respond like this unless it jumps $20 in a day
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:37:33
And back down again
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:30:29
hey... if I am right I will be receiving a free sports team in return for a correct guess
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:20:46
And down she goes...
