It's just a matter of eventuality.

ANy random amount will count, I would love to acquire 1 bitcoin by years end

I got the same picture in the Bay Area.

I am a realtor on semi sabbatical right now, and I can tell you it's not as easy as you think. I attempted yet did not get to far last year. If you have a property that may be slightly more affordable than mine perhaps it's will be possible. Location, cost and acceptability is what matters.

Hoping to earn enough tips to buy a trezor soon.

Sick! I have received 1000 bits at most. And you got 100$ worth is darn near a whole coin. Wish I had your luck
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:18:26
If you get really lucky you might be given enough of a tip to buy a beer! I have before and by all means would appreciate it again.

Neither Democrat nor Republican will audit the fed. It won't happen, in the case it does you will get 500bits
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:16:44
It obviously is, but who in their right mind does not want bits once they know and become evangelized to it. Especially if they are broke or unbanked like many users.
@_date: 2014-12-19 01:09:11
I plan on going tomorrow, I am really short on fiat and plan on acquiring 50$ worth
@_date: 2014-12-28 01:37:08
Do the more viable thing. Start up a bitcoin dating network.
@_date: 2014-12-28 17:46:34
Chaos, yet we won't experience that in our life time. Aren't all the coins mined by 2140?
@_date: 2014-10-15 06:14:47
If you think that's bad try buying bitcoin at their outrageous price mark up.  
What's worse is that they create a shitty product that does not facilitate nor encourage bitcoin growth and development. Lamasu ATMs seem to be more fair and to the point.
@_date: 2014-11-07 16:51:10
That is definitely true!
@_date: 2014-11-02 22:19:48
If there are any bits left I would be happy to claim
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:25:25
Any more kibble  sand bits
@_date: 2014-11-14 21:10:00
Many people are without work and this is the next best thing to panhandling. More power to him. An evangelical bum is better than a non evangelists.

PayPal will most likely be the buyer.  And I would say within 16 months.
@_date: 2014-10-15 18:34:16
Find a hooker that accepts it and a coke dealer too, and have fun. 
If not your better of hodling 
@_date: 2014-11-22 22:05:00
That was the conclusion I reached at the end of the listing
@_date: 2014-12-27 01:51:05
More Sprinkles!

Well my family last night was we don't accept bitcoin gifts, fuck me right after the year bitcoin has had.
