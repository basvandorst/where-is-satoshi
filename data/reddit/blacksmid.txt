Which crypto has more transactions then bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:46:49
Where is he saying that? He only says 0.01 isnt an insignificant amount of money. He never even mentions bitcoin mining, he explicitely says:


He mentions Nicehash in his first sentence and how you can get nice profits with a last gen AMD card. 
I have no clue how you could even think he is talking about bitcoin mining. Seriously, how?

ye do this. Shopify probably transfered the fiat to brianadiamond. Fiat is easy to reverse, besides, shopify probably has all the information needed to sue her. I dont know for how much you got scammed, but contact shopify. I'm pretty sure you can get your money back.

@_date: 2014-01-05 22:35:09
Shopify is quite a big and legitemate company. They will help you, they have a reputation to keep up. They can probably reverse the transaction, and if they cant, they can probably give you enough info to contact the shop owner and possibly sue him/her. Although you probably dont want to do that for 60$, but still, contacting him/her might solve the problem.

You have special printers that grant full control over that harddrive, so you can wipe it clean after. Other ways would be to print, and then smash the thing with a hammer. And i'd go for the second, because you never now if the delete button really deletes it, or just hides the file.
If you're storing significant amounts on a paperwallet, i'd deffiantly print it on a cheap ass printer, and then smash the fucker with a hamer and throw some magnets at it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:03:19
Yes but it hardly has faster or cheaper transactions. The network is very congested and I know people are waiting for hours/days to confirm just like with btc is the case.

100mBTC is just 60$. Don you  have some paper money laying around the house?
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:59:50
Thats only a couple.of 50k, that doesnt account for the full 850k. Besides it would totally ruin bitcoin's principals and youll never get the majority
@_date: 2014-03-29 22:46:44
Which is why we shouldn't be supporting centralised mining pools.
@_date: 2014-08-30 20:52:08
mbit/s is pronounced as mbits, and tbh a lot of people leave out the s when talking about speeds because it's obvious that it's per second from context. Most people just say a 100mbit connection, not 100mbit per second. Sometimes people use mbits, but it's hard to hear the difference.
I agree with the whole thing that we need to use bits, but please just call it something else. Or switch to satoshis, that's the real base unit anyways..

@_date: 2014-06-03 16:05:33
this is what my dad said, and he keeps nagging I should have sold. The truth is that if I had listened to my dad, I'd have sold them at 100$. At every 10$ bitcoin price rose my dad was like SELL SELL SELL. 
If you tell me to sell at any given time, then ofcourse you're also going to tell me to sell when it's at its peak.

@_date: 2014-01-21 00:31:34
False. 700-200*1 = 500. 500 divided over 10 is 50, so the formula is wrong.
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:00:21
He probably can't talk about it legally, and I dont think he claimed they were stolen. Just missing/unavaible.
@_date: 2014-09-29 12:43:22
It just keeps on generating untill it generates an address that has not been used before. The order in which the addresses are generated is always the same.
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:11:57
That would require saving the private keys in a less secure place. Fir example in your friends house or on some random server. If you choose to do this you dont need the safe in the bank anymore. Since they can just rob your friend instead of the bank
@_date: 2014-03-02 11:40:05
because you can also steal 20K bitcoins, and NO ONE WILL EVER NOTICE THEY ARE MISSING. And people will notice if you steal 850K.
@_date: 2014-07-02 12:01:53
Can we please just switch to Satoshis? I'm all for switching to a smaller unit, but bits is a HORRIBLE name for it. Not only is a bit already used, it's used in the very same subjects. Suppose you might start paying your mobile internet with bitcoin, the price will look something like this;
8 kilobit/s with a cap of 500 megabits for only 500 bits a month!(extra data bundle for 1 kilobit/bit)!
Please, lets either give it a REAL name, not just pick a random word from computerscience, or switch to the real unit, Sathoshis. Satoshis are the unit used in the actual source code, so please lets just use satoshis.
@_date: 2014-12-23 19:53:35

Alright, so time for update. I was on my way home from a LAN party, so like the stereotypical bitcoin geek I was carrying a way too heavy desktop and a monitor and my bag was full of cables and switches. I went into the shop, and got a bar of chocolate, a bag of chips and some cheese. Went to the check out, and the guy told me the price, and I asked if I could pay with Bitcoin. After a few second of staring at me he responded:
'uhh... ye sure, let me get the manager'
He rang a bell, and the manager came with a grin on his face saying: 'bitcoin?'
'Uh ye.. but i am not sure how it works' 
'its alright i will shoe you'
I continued to akwardly stand there with my desktop and monitor while the manager was explaining how it works. After 1-2ish minutes they showed me a qr code, i scanned, and 2 sec later it showed payed on their tablet. The manager said to the employee: 'isnt that cool uh'
'uh i guess'
It was pretty cool to use bitcoin in such a large chainstore, but this kindnof atuff where you just akwardly wait 2 min for the manager to come over and help out, is pretty common in Arnhem. When I go out for dinner i use bitcoin mostly, and it always goes something like this.
@_date: 2014-11-06 03:55:11
A decentralised version?  You mean something like a decentralised payment system, which is open to anyone and offers really cheap P2P transactions with some kind of impossible to fake signature?
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:19:04
Not really because he could just have copied the private key. Sure he can 'sell' the private key, but it would be foolish to buy them, because after he sold the private key, he can just send the bitcoins to another address he owns.
@_date: 2014-10-12 19:08:03

@_date: 2014-03-01 20:48:32
No, but if you ask s the local computer geek he might be tempted to steal some of the coins. The guy has been into bitcoin for years, might have thousands of coins.
@_date: 2014-09-18 13:55:35
Because it's costing them money to run these nodes. I think you under estimate the total cost of the tor network, it's all paid by node operators. Why do the node operators need to pay so other people can profit from it? Too be fair, users should atleast pay something to cover the expenses of the node operators some what, they dont need to earn money from it, but being able to pay node costs would be nice..

I think universities should jump in on bitcoin yea, but I dont think it's necesary to do any protocol changes for that. Universities all over the world should setup their own bitcoin nodes, and mining equipment, since they already have a lot of facilities like these, so it should be cheap for them to run a mining farm as well. Even if it's just a small one.
@_date: 2014-12-23 19:28:35
Easiest is probably to recreate your QR code in paint and scan that with your phone.
@_date: 2014-03-29 21:00:01
Instead, they'll probably switch to a different hashing algorithm, making that $1B hardware useless.
@_date: 2014-03-29 21:10:31
What are you talking about? If bitcoin is under attack by a party who can easily produce enough hashrate to outmine everyone else, bitcoin is gonna get pretty shitty.
I know it wont happen, because big parties like intel have no interest in spending $1B+ to kill bitcoin, but parent poster asked what would happen if they did. And it was suggested core devs would add PoS, while instead they'd probably change the hashing algorithme.
@_date: 2014-01-05 23:13:01
Hmm, well, just try to push it a bit. Shopify handled the payment, they can reverse it probably, since they payed the guy in fiat i suppose..
@_date: 2014-03-03 01:53:43
But how will they ever make their 500m$ back otherwise?
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:15:46
Why are litecoin mining botnets bad though? Sure botnets are bad, but putting them to use for something usefull is better. I think satoshi already saw this comming, and he said somewhere in a mail that Bitcoin might actually reduce spam, cause there will be less spambotnets!

I actually find it really usefull for international online payments. It's difficult to shop from stores in the USA from the netherlands. Sure, I could apply for a credit card, and go through all the hassle to get a credit card and set my self open to a lot of possible fraud etc, or I could scan a QR code and be done.(In the netherlands no one uses creditcard)

@_date: 2014-02-28 19:30:48
Eh ye it does. It would require a hard fork, which would give a lot of mess, and it would go straigth against the peincipals of bitcoin.
Also if they got stolen, they mifth have been spent multiply times qlready, in which case you'd have to steal btc from innocent and honnest btc users.
If anything like this happends, you wont get the majority if the people behind it. It would basicly be a altcoin with the same vlockchain except for the mtgox btc.
@_date: 2014-04-06 17:55:27
And he needs to transfer the coins, and to do it all very securely it'll take more then 10 min. You cant just print it, because pretty much all printers have a harddisk they use to save their prints.. To do it securely, it's actually pretty big effort.
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:46:28

Haha you made me laugh! First time I give someone gold, but hey, this is worth it.
@_date: 2014-01-23 16:40:18
That's not how it works. The market cap is calculated by current_price * amount_of_bitcoins
Now do you think if everyone sold his bitcoins, the price would still be 8-900$? Probably not, because there isn't actually that much money in the bitcoin econnomy. So an influence of 10 billion, would more than double the price, hell, I bet you we would probably hit 100K if they moved 10 billion into bitcoin overnight.
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:06:46
We can be pretty certain that most of the early blocks are his.
@_date: 2014-03-24 15:36:53
Exactly the same haha. When I said it was going to hit 1K in just one or two years in August last year, everybody just laughed at me. 3 months later we hit 1K haha : D

Meh not really. The prisoner's dilemma involves both parties getting a negative result, while if everyone selfishly mines, there isn't really a downside. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 18:06:40

@_date: 2014-04-06 17:21:01
It's still bad practice. The encryption is meant as EXTRA security layer, but thanks to this picture, it's practicly the only security layer. Because there's online .1 btc in there(atleast i think?) no one will actually try hard at this. 
If his story is real, this is pretty scumbag. His son made a big effort generating these keys on an offline machine, saved it on a paper wallet, and on two usbs, and encrypted them. His dad basicly made half of that effort useless by showing the encrypted keys. It's a pretty douchy move, even tho it wont lose him the bitcoin cause it's still a really computing intensive job to crack them, but in this case the password was obviously only there as an extra layer of security.
@_date: 2014-06-17 13:41:42
This is interesting.. Someone should make an altcoin based on this fact.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:57:23
Hard to say, there have been some guesses based on mining patterns, and most people agreed on somewhere around the 1 million figure. So 850k lost is about as much as satoshi supposedly has.
That being said, satoshi probably doesnt have every single bitcoin he mined. He was very altruistic in they way he set up bitcoin, unlike a lot of other altcoins which basicly give half of the coins to their creators. 
He might have destroyed a good chunk of the bitcoin, or he might just simply chose not to ever spend them as it will reveal his identity if one of the early blocks suddenly got spent. 
@_date: 2014-10-10 19:31:12

He's saying a local wallet on an online PC is dangerous. Windows pc especially get easily infected. Having an encrypted local wallet on your personal computer is fine, as long as it isn't more money then you'd be comfortable in having in cash. You wouldn't let 10K$ in cash sit around in the kitchen would you? Then dont leave 20 bitcoin in your local wallet. 
He's also not saying you should use web wallets. I'd strongly discourage using those actually. Just make sure he understands you need to store most your coins offline(dedicated pc to store the coins, disconnected from the internet, or paper wallets, etc.).

Not really. BTC-e is more shady then gox, sure. But BTC-e is always really stable and it just works. I dont think anyone ever had problems with BTC-e. Mt.Gox had so many fails, they got hacked before, insane lag, ridiculous bad trading platform, etc. The whole exchange just sucked, while BTC-E is a really good solid exchange. Only problem is that the owners are anonymous, and they appear like they're some russian blackhats.

No. With kickstarter, projects need a certain amount of money to be developed. Say I have a really good plan for project x, but I need 20K$ to buy the tools i need to develop it. I could start a kickstarter, get some money from it, and make project x.

'cheap', you realize it's real worth is either 0 or 1 right? 0.5 btc for a goxcoin sounds really really good right now, and I bet anyone would take that, but in fact if you believe in mtgox, 0.5 is still way too cheap. 
If 0.5 were too expensive, because their real value is 0, 0.08 is still a pretty good deal.
@_date: 2014-12-29 01:42:47
Note that the crypto behind bitcoin is not mathematicly proven to be secure. So saying bitcoin is unhackable because of maths is actually a lie. Its generally assumed to be unhackable because mathematicians generally agreed that we can asume things like P = NP.

Let's be fair here. Bitcoin is an amazing system, and it's potential is enormous. On top of that, it's a global currency. Right now we have a market cap of 7b$. That's not even half of Bill gate's net worth, FOR A GLOBAL CURRENCY. 7b$ is peanuts on global scale. If bitcoin really breaks through, expect atleast a 100-1000 times increase.
Fasten your seatbelts, because it's gonna be a wild ride.

What a less common name so more confusion? Lets be honest, bit is so widely used, even in the same areas bitcoin can or is used already! Naming it 'bit' will be only more confusing. why would we ever pick a word that's already used for a ton of stuff to be the unit of Bitcoin? Cant we call it something else? Or just use Satoshis already, after all, they are also the base unit in the actual source code.

Exactly this.. Worst part is that I'm into computer science, and when I actually read it I was like WOW THIS IS AMAZING. Bought coins the next day, at 70$, so it wasn't too late into the game, but still, I read about it in 2009, but didn't bother to research it. If i did, I would have bought a ton of coins aswell because I understand how brilliant the protocol is.

Because normal money transactions are not taxed 22%?
@_date: 2014-03-01 10:32:05
Exactly. If you run such a big exchange, you can easily take a couple of thousand coins which is a LOT.
@_date: 2014-06-01 23:55:33
To be honest its not so mich about the money. Few cents for using their client is not a problem. Hell if youd take 10$ from my bank account i probably wouldnt even notice, so the few cents ill be paying for multibit shouldnt be bothering me.
But it is bothering me.  Im not sure why, but all i like round nummers and small payments like this screw with my round nummers: (. Also it males me think of making a transaction because it costs me extra money.
I also thinks this can potentially ruin micro payments with multibit.

No. Some of the stolen btc migth have been spent, thus making a lot of transactions invalid. A lot of innocent peole might have some of the stolen coins, without knowing. These would just dissapear. Howd you feel if you had nothibg to do with mtgox because you arent a retard, and you suddenly miss 20 bitcoins from your wallet, just cause the network decided to give them back to mark, even tho he is the one who messed up!

You can point your miners to a pool of your choice.

Most of it? Are you crazy? Someone cashing out half a million btc suddenly will get caught. They will probably just buy a shitloads of things and sell few hundred btc, carefully mixed. If they spent 1000 btc, which ia a lot, it will only be less than 0.2%, hiw does that qualify as most?
Besides, why would they cash out? First, there is no way you can cash out that many, nit to mention it will be suspicious as hell.
 
Secondly, if you would have stolen half a billion dollars, what would be the best way for you to hold this kind of money? You cant stick it under yiur matress, and you cqnt deposit it at a bank either. The best way to hold that much stolen money is in bitcoin, sonwhy cash out at all?

That's a good point. But you dont know. Maybe they are not allowed to run such an exchange because they are working for a company that's heavy anti bitcoin. Or maybe they are convicted cyber criminals and they'd lose all trust if they'd make them self public. You simply dont know. 
I agree with you that it's worrysome. But the site itself is amazingly good.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:09:36
In the netherlands you do not have a profit tax like in the US. Instead you have a capital tax(kapitaal belasting), which includes all of your properties. It is basicly your net worth (so loans and mortgages etc can be used to reduce your capital) So this DOES include any crypto currency. 
For every euro your networth is above 25k euro you pay 1.2% tax on a yearly basis.
For more infromation you can see: 
tl;dr: Yes you pay capital tax over everything that has value. Cryptocurrencies are specificly mentioned on the belastingsdiensts website. But if you have any kind of loan like a  mortgage  you can use this to reduce your capital tax.

You could solve the first one by trying to do a plaintext attack. The first 6 values translated to 310 310 310 310 310 310.
Since the title is 310, and its written on the puzzle its not unreasonable to try some classical ciphers that either make 310 appear or with the release date as key.

While it is not a sound 1:1 analogy, I think it very clearly shows the motivation and philosphy behind certain tech choices. Layers of abstraction is a very big thing in computer science, and in general it is considered very benefitial. The OSI model with the tcp/ip stack as main example is just a very good analogy. There are multiple of these layered systems, but OSI model is just the most well known and maybe even the most widely used stack. The TCP/ip example just argues that layering on top of bitcoin is a good idea, as opposed to growing bitcoin (like implementing hyper text functuonality inside of tcp instead of on top of tcp in the form of http).

The wallet collects your coordinates from your phone/gps, and sends those to their server. The server then sends back all the bitcoin addresses of other users in their database who are nearby.

You are not stealing the money, you are stealing the services.
You use the roads, you went to school, you count on the police and fire departments to keep you save.. NOT paying for these services is theft. Its akin to walking into a store getting what you want and then argueing not paying is not theft because the store owner is not the rightfull owner to you dollars, and you are not taking any money from him.
I get it, taxes suck. But no taxes would suck even more.

Probably difficult. However, you do not want to share this anyhow. Maybe in 10 years when bitcoin is 1 million a piece, you'll share some subtle detail that leads to you. Sure the chance is very small, but in crypto the general idea is to be as safe as possible.
Just like you could probably keep all your bitcoin on an android phone wallet, you absolutely do not want to do that because of many obvious reasons.

Well let's not pretend like segwit is backwards compatible. While non-segwit nodes will verify segwit blocks, it's not really backward compitable as segwit needs 50% of the miners to run a segwit node. 
While it does work, it's kinda a big hack just to get 4 MB blocks without 'hardforking'. It has a lot of downsides and the only upside is that it does not require a hardfork.
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:01:20
Sorry but what kind of potential does segwit provide except for transaction malibility? We can fix that in a seperate fix, why change the whole transaction format for just that?
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:56:55
I'm kinda shocked that I get negative karma for posting this.. I support any scaling solution (including segwit). However, we cannot hide that segwit does have it's downsides. While it does help scaling, and it solves some issues like tx malibility, it is not perfect.

You'll still need a host for the game. How would you determine who gets  which cards otherwise? You need to trust a 3rd person to supply you the cards. The problem is that you need to randomly generate 2 cards that you get, but to generate this, you need to know which cards the opponent has, because you cant get the same cards. The problem here is that you still need to trust a 3rd person to do this, because you cant generate your own cards, cause you'd need to know how the deck is ordered.
@_date: 2015-02-22 21:04:04
Not a lot. Might be a litle better for connectivity since they probably have more bandwith than a single one.

With a 51% you cant magicly create bitcoin. All you can do is reverse transactions. That's all. Besides it'll be pretty clear there is a 51% attack going on, if something like that happends, bitcoin will find a solution. Also, if miners find out their pool uses their power for a 51% attack, nearly all miners will switch pool since it's bad for bitcoin's price, and it's in their advantage if bitcoin price goes up.

Then go ahead, fork bitcoin-qt and change a few constants. It's not that hard if you have a technical background. If you dont know anything about the technical workings for bitcoin, dont even bother.

maybe, but the network will catchup in hashing speed eventually. It will majorly slow down bitcoin, but it's not as big as a deal as you make it sound, it will just slow down adoption, but it wont kill it lol.
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:42:10
It has to do with how the bitcoin protocol works. You have to understand that there isn't anything like a bitcoin. The blockchain is a long chain of transactions. It doesn't keep track of account balances, it just keeps track of transactions. When you send a bitcoin, what you actually do is spend one of your transactions.
When you send a bitcoin, you have to link an incomming transaction to our address that's already in the blockchain and that you didn't spend yet. Lets say you have an address that has one transaction to it of 1 BTC that isn't spend yet. If you want to send 0.1 BTC to another address, you tell the network;
'Hey guys, I had this 1 BTC transaction yesterday, and I want to send 0.1 BTC to address B, and 0.89 BTC to one of my own addresses, and you can keep 0.01 BTC as fee'
Notice this also explains why we have change addresses. You cant spend a fraction of an open transaction, cause after you spend it, the transaction will be marked as used.
So the fee you are paying doesn't have ANYTHING to do with the amount you're sending, but with the amount of inputs and outputs you have.
The inputs are the transactions you are going to spend, and the outputs are the addresses to which you want to send btc. If you use multiply inputs and outpus, the transaction gets bigger cause you have to include more information. Storage in the blockchain is limited, so this requires a higher fee.
Besides that, the bitcoin network charges fees for low amount transactions so that you dont spam the blockchain with 1 satoshi transactions.

Not only protect, but by mining, you are influencing the network. It gives you power in the network. If you own 90% of the hashing rate, you can decide a lot..
When something like a fork happens, china could decide wich branch we continue on. Because they have the majority of the hashing power, and will be able to create the longest branch. Same goes for things like blocksize or anything we might want to change.

Alright I'm running a bruteforcer in C. It's badly coded, but it's smashing away a whopping 6 keys/sec. Right now checking all lower case letters. 
Ok did some optimalisation and it is running a bit over 7 keys/sec. I need to go to work now. Ill let it try all lower case letters to start off with. Ill let it run all letters plus digits prob this nigth. Maybe we need to setup a pool and split the btc xD
Ok i'm back from work, and appearntly my computer crashed. I think it's heat issues, or my powersupply starts giving up. Either way, my hardware is dieing and I'm hardly pushing out 7 keys/sec.. This encryption is really resource intensive.. jeez
If OP uses a char set of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and 10 weird chars(!@ etc), that's 72^3 combinations = 373248. With my whopping 7 keys/sec that'd take 14 hours.. Too bad my computer crashes after 5 min.
IF ANYONE WITH DECENT HARDWARE IS READING THIS, PLZ PM ME AND WE CAN POOL.

No, because if they had just bought bitcoins for the same amount, they would have more profit.
If you buy a miner for 9K, and it's only going to generate 6K$ worth of bitcoins, you are beter off buying 9K$ worth of bitcoin. If the price rises of bitcoin, that 6K worth might be 10K, and you'd have made 1K profit. If you had bought 9K worth of bitcoin, you'd have 15K worth, aka 6K profit.

I am hoarding my coins, and I'm just using an local wallet crypted with a password i dont use for other things. I also never enter the password, cause I never send coins from it, I just receive on it and hoard them. I feel like this is really safe, although paper wallets might be even better.
The thing with paper wallets is though that I can lose them, and it's just paper.. Who knows what happens to it in the next 5 years. it might be so worn off that I cant read anythign at all. If I have tickets in my wallet for more then a week, all the letters fade away, and after a month or so it's just a yellow piece of paper. Paper wallets sound like a lot of hassle cause you can lose it and such. I feel like a local wallet with a password I NEVER EVER TYPE so I cant get keylogged is a better way to store them..

I just looked up the average net worth of a person, and that happens to be 20,372$. So if we divide this by the average amount of btc a person will hold(0.00168947) we get the price of one bitcoin once we reach 100% adoption.

The current hashing power is 0.8 PH/s. This means the hashing power will more than triple by the time these are delivered. So divided your profits by 3-4 to get any real look on how much you'll make with it.(For the lazy for you, it means it will never pay off.)

Your numbers are wrong. The total bitcoin network isn't 5.5TH/s, but 6 PH/s. Thats more then 1000 times more. So forget the 43 million figure, you're gonna need 43 billion..

Actually, yes; satoshin

Well thank you, kind bot! Merry christmas &lt; 3
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:48:07
Very true. It's already dropping.
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:52:34
Also you still have 70 btc left. If btc break through, that's going to make your very, very rich. I'm already happy I managed to get 7 BTC together lol..
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:56:53
Or he didn't care about the Windows crypto libs, cause he knew better implementations would arise soon.
@_date: 2013-10-26 18:37:10
same here!
@_date: 2013-09-07 17:12:05
except I dont mine, so I got no money on there. Also, since you have to do it over HTTP, bruteforcing is really slow, over http you can hardly get 100 tries a second.
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:04:37
If he uses unicode characters that's pretty much cheating. If it is more entropy than 3 bytes we should all give up on bruting it.. It looks like my implementation is the fastest right now, and it's only 7 key/sec..
@_date: 2013-12-26 11:50:59
Yes, but it's a very small win, unless you start talking about 100s of dollars then it gets significant, but bellow that, it doesn't really have a huge advantage.
@_date: 2013-09-07 23:12:04
Well, probably like half an hour. To be honest, i dont feel like counting binary for half an hour and trying passwords.
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:08:15
I optimilasied it to 7 keys/sec. It's about 1000 times faster.
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:53:22
You have a very nice keyboard. Any chance you're a fellow sc2 player? : D

No. Netherlands. Some families do give present with christmass here, but majority doesn't. We do get a second day off at christmass tho, so we got that going for us : D
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:19:53
Depends where you are located. For us Coinbase sounds good. But I'm not from the us so cant say anything about it. I'm from the Netherlands, and I really like bitonic.nl, which is great instant buying service for just a litle premium.
It's impossible to know how much people are using btc. This is due the way the protocol works. I have 7 BTC, at which i'm pretty proud since I'm just 17, so this is qutie a lot of money for me :D.
@_date: 2013-12-26 11:53:09
Yes, money is usefull, but it defeats the purpose of a gift. If everyone would just get each other some money, you firstly get problems because some people will give more money then others. That kinda ruins a lot..
Also if I give you 10$, and you give me 10$, why bother giving presents at all? And even better, if you give me 10$, but I only give you 5$, now how would that make everybody feel? You'll be pissed, I'll feel sorry cause I didn't give enough, etc.
@_date: 2013-12-08 10:27:10
Well look it up, that is the hashing speed. There is no denying.
@_date: 2013-09-22 12:26:22
I sell and buy bitcoins locally, just to bring bitcoins more to the attention. Normally i have like 3% premium, so I can pay all the fees, and get a free hamburger from it.
@_date: 2013-10-06 09:54:13
no. Unless they can prove it's drug money, it's not drug money. You know 90% of the USD paper money has been used in drug deals? So when you pay in cash, 90% of it is drug money.

@_date: 2013-09-15 19:52:55
The owners of BTC guild are already earning quite a bit of bitcoin cause they run a bigass pool. If they would use it to attack bitcoin, the value would drop, and thus they'll lose a lot of money, cause they earn bitcoins.. really, it's of the best interest to them if bitcoin gets sucsessfull.
@_date: 2013-09-22 16:02:40
Yes. But this isn't inherent to the bitcoin protocol, it's inherent to MONEY in general. Only the wealthiest few %(dont know the exact number, but i believe it's like 5%) can choose what they'll have for dinner tonight. And if you look at the dollar specificly, the majority of the dollars are controlled by the top 1%. It'slife.
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:35:13
Something along that lines yes. It was 30$ at the start of this year, and right now its 208.5 that's 695% increase and the year isn't over yet!
@_date: 2013-10-07 05:59:48
Excuse me, but if we have Q = k * G, and you only know Q and G, can't you just do k = Q/G?
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:19:20
Totally agree!
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:33:57
Well to be fair, it's just money. If i'd get a 20$ bill as present, I'd be kinda dissapointed, and the guy who gave it would look like a douchebag..
Now if someone gives me 20$ worth in some weird ass currency I dont want, how does this suddenly make a good present?
I like btc, but I dont think it's right to force your opinion on other people like that, especially not because it's just money, and money doesn't really make a good christmass present..
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:02:12
Yes, but if you're the US gov, you can just print that, so that's no problem.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:25:03
Multibit syncs with a remote server yes. The only thing that they could do is tell you, you received a payment you didn't. The risk here is that if the multibit developers buy something from you, they can make it look like you received a transaction, while in fact, you did not. That's all really, I'd gladly store 1000 bitcoins in multibit if I had that much. As long as you aren't running a big business and you' re using multibit to process the payments, there is practicly no risk.
@_date: 2013-10-27 00:04:28
What exacly are you trying to improve on. If you just clone bitcoin but name it WheyinspireCoin, you're not gonna get anyone using it.
Unless you have some insanely smart ideas and innovations just like satoshi himself, dont even bother making just another altcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:34:03
Verifying a transaction and putting it in the blockchain doesn't cost the miner anything. Well it does ofc a litle tiny bit, but it's practicly nothing compared to the hashing it's doing. So really, even 0.10$ would be plenty.
The only thing against this really is the limited blocksize, once it's full, its full. But as long as the block isn't filled 0.10$ is way plenty for the amount of work it costs the miner.
EDIT: im getting downvotes cause stupid banks/companies with a monopoly charge more % wise. That's the only fucking reason. I thought bitcoin meant to pretty much eliminate the transactions costs, not just lower it a tiny bit.
@_date: 2013-09-09 19:18:26
sounds better than mine 5 bitcoin bought at 120 usd just previous week.
@_date: 2013-10-10 14:33:46
Sorry but that's not possible. Sure you can say it's possible, just a small chance, but that chance is so unbelievably small, that it's impossible.

That's just because there aren't ASICs yet for litecoin. With the recent price surge, it gets more and more interesting for companies to design litecoin ASICS. They will come eventually..
Also the numbers dont really make any sense, cause 1) by the time butterflylabs delivers you the Monarch, you'll need a LOT more then 9000 of them. Secondly, BFL wont be making 9K of them.
Litecoin is fine, but I dont really see what it actually does better than bitcoin. All you are saying is that it isn't a whole lot worse than bitcoin.. And dont bring up faster transactions cause we all know that's bullshit.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:58:35
Yes it will crash. The question will be though if it'll crash bellow 300$. The price might shoot up to 2K$, then 'crash' to 400$. Or it might just crash now all the way down to 150$
@_date: 2013-09-29 19:51:22
This is some weird ass litecoin clone, probably premined like fuck too.
@_date: 2013-09-08 17:45:09
Yea i was serious :(
@_date: 2013-10-19 15:50:41
as long as its not in a block, you can double spend it and include a tx fee so that one gets accepted, and the one in limbo gets forgotten. It's a bit hard cause pretty much all clients dont have a function to try to doublespend coins.
@_date: 2013-09-08 18:34:14
Lolgetting so many downvotes cause I didn't see it xD

@_date: 2013-11-03 20:14:47
That's probably because it didn't have a lot of inputs. The amount isn't the problem, it's the amount of inputs. More inputs means a bigger transaction, and thus more space wasted in the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-10-06 18:42:49
haha that small bump wont do anything.
@_date: 2013-09-22 16:06:16
I think it's a great way to get value from A to B without having to ship tons of gold. But yea, bitcoin would be amazing convenient for everyday's transactions, but no one would want to spend their coins.
When ever i buy somethign that I can also buy using XBT, I always buy it using euros, because i rather sit on a pile of bitcoin than on a pile of fiat.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:56:15
I'm getting 7 key/sec on my 3.3 ghz hexacore with a C implementation.
@_date: 2013-09-10 19:06:32
yea, I suppose that would have made quite a few bitcoins back in the early bitcoin days.
@_date: 2013-10-25 21:41:17
Or they could print a few dollars and just buy them with monopoly money.
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:35:22
You realise we had a 100x increase EVERY year for the past 4 years? It's not crazy. I'm not saying we'll keep going at that rate, but another 100x in the next decade is very plausible..

@_date: 2013-11-03 21:50:14
It's a bit easier if they accept unconfirmed transactions though. I could just broadcast the transaction without a fee for the coffee, and as soon as I walk away, broadcast a transaction with the same input to myself with a fee. It wont always work, but sometimes the transaction to my self will be included instead of the older one.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:34:30
Haha my cpu isn't that amazing as it sounds, it's AMD too, so they cut corners on other stuff in the cpu. But it's a tiny bit faster then yours and has 2 more cores.
Yea, our implementations have similar speeds. It's really amazing how 19.8 billion operations per second only get me to 7ish keys per second.
Right now it's not running, cause my computer has serious heat issues and crashes when I run it for longer then 10 min.. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 12:34:17
It wont destroy bitcoin at all. Sure it will annoy people for a 20 week period, but that's about it. Also, dont forget the normal bitcoin markets keeps adding hashrate at a pretty insane rate too. It wont be to bad.
@_date: 2013-09-17 22:16:32
That is an expensive mistake.

check his browser history to see if he has any online wallets. Also look around for these programs: bitcoin-qt, multibit, armory and electrum. If you find any of these 4, run them, it should show you how many coins he has. You can't spend them without his password though. If it's a big about of coins, you might wanna try and bruteforce it.
If you find websites like BTCguild, slush, 50btc, and many other in his browsing history, those are called mining pools. If you find a miningpool site, see if he is still logged in thanks to cookies. If he is, you can probably withdraw some coins he has left over there.
You should post back with some info. Also you might wanna get some help of someone who knows bitcoin, so he knows what he is looking for.
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:19:02
Well atleast it's better than having bought a pizza for 10K.. :P
@_date: 2013-09-08 17:44:18
but still.. Seems kinda stupid to trust on that. Governments and other agencies who dont like bitcoin, could setup big miners and if they get a block ocasionally they can majorly fuck with the network.
@_date: 2013-09-25 14:44:36
Well actually, the rewards will stay the same... Since the difficulty doesn't change at all.
@_date: 2013-09-07 19:24:16
thing to watch out for is easy reversable transactions like paypal. Dont sell your bitcoin for paypal dollars to people you dont trust. Paypal will ALWAYS side with the buyer, and there is no way you are gonna get your bitcoin back.
@_date: 2013-10-06 12:16:07
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:29:01
Same here. I'm never going to sell. If BTC drops, I just buy more :). Always buy, never sell.
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:20:06
Buying drugs isn't illegal where I live. If I had money on that site, the US would have 0 rights to take those bitcoins from me.. Ofc they'd still take them, but it's stealing.
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:00:16
Because stuff like mortgage or other very large amounts will wait for multiply verifications, and it will be practicly impossible to double spend it.
Cups of coffee on the other hand will prob have to be unconfirmed transactions, cause nobody has the time to wait 5-10 min for a new block for a goddamn cup of coffee.
@_date: 2013-09-05 18:58:39
see that's the problem, pretty much everything i can get using bitcoin, i can buy with paypal too. And to be honnest with you, with the current crisis, I much rater sit on a pile of bitcoins, then on a pile of green paper with EURO on it.

@_date: 2013-09-10 18:16:36
haha yea.. If only I mined right when bitcoin was launched, together with satoshi, getting some of his million coins. I actually had some pretty decent hardware for it back then, I prob had access to 100-200 dual cores
