Confirmed it in what way?  
Look --Karpeles is in Japan for regulatory arbitrage.  He is not there because he's Japanese or enjoys the scenery.  
TM was a 3yr old issue which was on the Wiki for a year.  And suddenly, when the SR2 coins are known to be 'on the move', the issue comes to the forefront?  You might buy that, but I don't.  Karpeles is using that as a convenient smokescreen, and it really couldn't be more obvious.
The fraud, in order to be committed, required someone to FALSELY claim to GOX (or another exchange) that their coins were never sent, when they actually were.  They would need GOX to MANUALLY re-send those coins, in the hopes of receiving them twice.  Now how many times do you think that could happen before they notice their cold storage funds depleting?  It's not the least bit believable!!
I realize that betting with other peoples' coins/money is Legal in Japan.  But I STRONGLY doubt that filing a false police report is.  Let's see if Karpeles is willing to file a false police report...
Morally speaking, and legally speaking, if they are insolvent, then that proprietary trading engine should be liquidated to make the customers more whole.  But you know what?  I wouldn't be surprised if Karpeles' left hand sold his right hand a copy of the engine for $1, just in case.

Or he's just saying that they're lost, so as to keep them from being confiscated by the Feds.

I would not doubt it.  They're tracking activity on the 500k coins that were stolen back in 2011.  I think Mark is dipping into his rainy day fund...
Those coins 'from 2011' are interesting -- those are most likely the coins Karpeles swept out of people's accounts and called it a hack. He leaked that password file into the wild to establish plausible deniability -- not unlike that recent 'crisis paper' leak. And then just swept them right into his own rainy-day wallet. Remember the 500,000 BTC that went missing? What year was that... 2011. Those early users got in before passwords were salted. And never changed their passwords after the salting routine was added. Who better than Mark would know how best to exploit that? The evidence would be quite simple... How many of those unsalted accounts lost their coins? I'll bet they all did. Though I wouldn't put it past him to leave the ones with $0.50 or less alone. He got greedy. And even though the password file was leaked, hackers would have still needed time to brute-force them. And there wasn't enough time -- not for all of them!! Mark did it, and made it look like it was a hack. It really couldn't be any clearer.
