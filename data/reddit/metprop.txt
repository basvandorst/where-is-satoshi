Are you talking about him writing "Bitcoin Core" ?
If so, I hope using these words does not instantly make one a pro-BCH/BTC-hater. Otherwise it would be an indicator the hate some want to spread has gotten deep into the Bitcoin community.
I might be wrong on this, but this guy seems like a legit researcher with scientific methods to me, I've not seen anything like "buy BCH" in his website.

It is no secret indeed, that today green energies amount for a small proportion of the global energy mix. Rather than the joke AA makes about "green coin", I think what is interesting in this talk is when he explains crypto-mining could be a great leverage to green energy.
Also, the fact that the banking system uses a lot of energy is interesting too.

I have seen some connections to a few "bitcore" nodes, not a lot of them though. Usually more than half peers are "Satoshi" (most are 0.15.1). I regularly see some Breadwallet, Coinscope-GH, btc.cs.njit.edu, bitnodes, btcwire, and others I don't remember.
The "Banned peers" view often lists 5-10 peers (I don't manually send commands to the node, I let it do its stuff).

It's great for decentralization to have a lot of nodes controlled by individuals, though if all of them are physically centralized this is not as strong decentralization as we would want.
The datacenter is controlled by a company, if it is to be shutdown for whatever reason, we can't do anything about it and the network will lose the nodes.
Strong decentralization requires individuals to have full control over their node.

Beware with live install systems, I can't find the link anymore but I've read they have a lot of security flaws because they are made to boot and install a system as fast as possible (so they run in root mode and do not stop access to HDDs, and things like that), they are not made to be safe enough for things like crypto.
Using a system specifically made for security (like Tails) should be much safer.

Given what Bitcoin is today, reducing difficulty would reduce security. PoW is a big part of Bitcoin's security, and auto-difficulty adjustment is required for PoW.
Also I don't think reducing difficulty would necessarily reduce fees. How high are fees is the result of supply and demand.
Having said that, we don't know how will technically be Bitcoin even in 5 years. It will most likely be very different from today, so it's little use trying to predict things based on data that will become obsolete.

Today if you want to help decentralize Bitcoin mining, you have little choice but buying an Antminer (sold by Bitmain). The problem is that giving money to Bitmain is likely to hurt Bitcoin because they own one of the biggest mining pool (which is bad for decentralization), and they support BCH (Jihan Wu, ASICBOOST, and all of that).
So we're kind of stuck right now until new non-Bitmain mining hardware like the [DragonMint miner]( is available.
[According to Andreas Antonopoulos]( now that 16nm have been reached it will become easier for individuals to mine because the competitive advantage of privately-owned-big-pools will be reduced over time.
EDIT: I forgot to mention [Antbleed]( which is a good reason not to buy Bitmain's Antminers.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:33:14
Ok I did not get you meant "reducing the difficulty to increase the block rate", so yes it might reduce fees that way. I don't know the exact reason why a delay of 10min was chosen, but I guess changing it would have some side effects and there should be other "less hacky" ways to increase the transaction capacity without those side effects. This should be verified though, it's just a guess.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:26:14
It depends on what level of security you are satisfied with. I guess without a big node shutdown event it won't be easy to test if the current decentralization is "enough" or not, but then again when it comes down to security it's just a matter of choosing your expectations. I want Bitcoin to become very big so mine are pretty high :)


Totally agree. That's a real individual-controlled node, no one can (easily) shut it down but you. Seems like we do agree after all.

Bitstamp is one of the best to me. They support Segwit, their interface is easy to understand, they have 0.25% fees for exchange transactions and 0 fee for bitcoin withdrawal. You just need to get validated (this can take a few weeks), but that's the same for every exchange.
Don't assume your coins are safe in any exchange though. If you want to hodl, send them to a cold storage wallet of yours. All exchanges are big targets for hackers and they can get hacked anytime, in which case you are likely to lose your coins overnight.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:13:08
Seems like "having full control" does not mean the same thing for you and for me.
When someone can push a button to shut it down and I can't do anything about it, so I have to look for an alternative (which should not be taken for granted as the cause of the datacenter shutdown might as well affect other datacenters), I do not consider it being in my full control.
Spreading this idea to ISPs is pretty relevant I think, as these could be targeted by a crypto-hostile government to shut Bitcoin down. The issue is that today, AFAIK it's another level of difficulty for individuals to have Internet access without an ISP.
As always with security it's just a matter of choosing where your expectations lie and what you want to (and can) be prepared for. Granted that today not a lot of governements seem to be willing to totally ban cryptocurrencies, but I would not bet against it in the years to come.

Yes it will, Bitcoin is software and being upgraded is 100% part of it. Watch [this talk]( from Andreas Antonopoulos "looking at the historical possibility that the brand "bitcoin" is one of only a few things that survive radical change of the underlying technology".
The key differences with other coins are :
* Upgrading Bitcoin is tougher because it has to stay compatible with older versions, as a lot of people are using it already,
* other coins can learn from Bitcoin's mistakes and avoid some issues more easily.
That being said :
* Every coin will have scaling issues. As Andreas Antonopoulos says, [scaling is a moving target, it's never "solved".](
* Some things like security can only be tested when a lot of people use the coin, so Bitcoin has a big advantage on this.
* Maybe the even bigger thing Bitcoin has more than others is the brand. Getting people's knowledge and trust is a big deal, and it will take a lot to reach Bitcoin's level of visibility and trust.

The Bitcoin Gold fork did this, switching to the Equihash algorithm for mining.
However changing algorithm does not mean a new specialized hardware cannot be made for the new algorithm, in which case it would be a step back because the hardware race would happen again and bring the centralization that comes with it.

Bitcoin Core runs well on an RPi 2B, so you should be fine with an RPi 3. Did not try LN yet though.
Make sure your internet plan is not capped though because it can consume a lot of bandwidth.

An RPi node is the cheapest by far. It takes a bit of time setting up things but it's worth it imho.

Make sure your internet plan isn't capped, as a full node can use a lot of bandwidth, easily hundreds of GBs per month.

No need to be rude. If this is a 2FA wallet, fees are indeed paid to TrustedCoin.

I would feel safer logging in using a 4G connection from my smartphone.
If you really must do this from a public wifi and have no choice, make sure you had 2FA enabled before (using a safer connection), and then change your password asap (using a safer connection too). In fact as a rule of thumb always enable 2FA for security critical services (email, money, etc.).

I stumbled upon [this article]( about developers not being the ones with "the interests and priorities most closely aligned with Bitcoin users", I think the writer has some good points.

It seems like after writing this line, your computer tries to find the system on the wrong hard drive. Or maybe the config is invalid.
You must find a way to edit the fstab file. You can do this by booting on another system (e.g. a live system on an USB stick), and edit it back to its original state, then try booting again.
If you can boot again after doing this, it means you entered something wrong to fstab, so you'll have to check what was wrong with the line you added.

In the current context with ASICBOOST, mining centralization, coin competition and fee attacks being effective, it's clear than some miners have incentives to work against the network. When these incentives will be weaker (with SegWit and Schnorr deployed), miners will be "nicer".
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:03:15
Simplified explanation for background : This problem is known as "scalability". The Bitcoin "transaction pipe" is currently too small to handle efficiently all the transactions that are happening right now. Fees act like a priority indicator to know which transactions are urgent and which transactions can wait for a few hours or days. The smaller the pipe is compared to the number of transactions, the more fees increase.
Technically, fixing this scalability issue is non trivial, it's a big deal. Actually multiple features and improvements in the Bitcoin software will be required. Currently, the most awaited feature is called the "Ligthning Network" or "LN", some say on the long term it can reduce the pressure on the "transaction pipe" by 90+%. [This video]( from Andreas Antonopoulos explains how LN works, I recommend watching it. The Lightning Network is currently under development and it is expected to be deployed in 2018. This will be big.
In the meantime, we must cope with these high fees, which according to Trace Mayers [here]( are an indicator that people trust Bitcoin because they are still OK to pay high fees.
TLDR: we need the "Lightning Network" feature to lower fees significantly, it is expected in 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:42:53
Be sure not to get confused about this because you may lose money : BCH and BTC are different currencies, you cannot directly convert BCH to BTC. For this you need to send your BCH to an exchange, then ask to sell them and get BTC in return.
Never send yourself BCH to a BTC wallet, they will be lost.
So the plan to change your BCH to BTC would be :
- find a wallet that supports BCH,
- sweep your BCH to it by giving the private key from the BTC address they come from (you already moved your BTC from this address, so you do not risk someone stealing your BTC with this private key),
- send your BCH to an exchange,
- create an order to sell your BCH and get BTC,
- send your BTC to your BTC wallet.
More info [here]( for the Coinomi wallet. Be sure to be comfortable with all of this before proceeding. Good luck ! :D
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:00:54
In Electrum you have to change the settings to allow manually editing the fee.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:03:01
When you have coins in an exchange, they own the money for you (you don't have the private key, they do). In that case, it's up to them to decide if they want to support the hard fork, if they support it at all. You are bound to their decision.
If you have your coins in your own wallet before a hard fork (you have the private key, no one else does), you can get your forked coins whenever you want e.g. by sweeping them to a wallet that supports it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:22:32
Yep, the point is you don't have less anonymity using a decentralized exchange than a centralized one.
The big direct gain is more that you don't have trust someone else to hold your money. The drawback is that's it's less efficient and you have to wait.
Also in general, decentralized is more resilient and secured than centralized.

If you do not really need to spend your coins right now, just wait. Or if you want to send the coins anyway but you have no problem waiting for the transaction to be confirmed you can try with a low fee. I'm currently waiting for a 14 sat/B transaction to finish, it's been 9days so far, some people told me I had to wait another 2 weeks.

Yes, using crypto-currencies is scary because they are really different from what we're used to. We need to take it slow, manipulate low amounts first, learn how things work.

I think fees are only for miners. And with the processing power of a RPi, you can't expect anything from mining, even in a mining pool.

Good points, thank you for your input.


I agree. The current context must be playing a big part in this.
- Most Bitcoin users are buying for speculation, and using exchanges rather than their own wallet (which is way more complicated), so they are not directly affected by high fees.
- Big exchanges are busy scaling up and can't support Segwit immediately.
- On top of this, some miners are spamming the network in a time when mining is still pretty centralized (by p2p's standards).
These are many causes probably making the current fee level "not high enough" for incentivising efficient use of block space, as you wrote. 
Though for Bitcoin to be used as a real currency, fees are definitely too high I think. But today I'm not too concerned about it because Bitcoin is far from being used as a real currency, it first have to grow a lot for this I guess, both technically and socially.

As long as both the sender and receiver addresses of the transaction are within the exchange's system, the blockchain is unchanged. If you command the exchange to send money from or to an address external to the exchange, this is on the blockchain.
So exchanges are midly affected by the congestion compared to users using the blockchain for every transaction.

As all the mentioned solutions are meant to "increase the pipe size" (this is a metaphor for representing Bitcoin's transaction capacity), I guess you are referring to the **5.2 Block size and "Bitcoin Cash" (BCH)** section. We need to go a bit technical to explain this.
Here are the dangerous effects :
- The approach to increase block size and not doing SegWit means no - or at least not on a short term - Smart Contracts, no Shnorr signatures, no LN, and a lot of other things because they are all based on SegWit. These features will be so important for Bitcoin in the future to scale up and satisfy users' expectations, I can't imagine not having them ASAP.
- If the currency is succesful (which it aims to so should be ready for it), it is expected to scale up by several orders of magnitude. We can take the current number of transactions and multiply it by 1M to get an idea of what scale it could grow in a few years. Which means block size will also need to be increased several orders of magnitude, so at some point each block would need to be 1TB or more. This means the blockchain will have +1TB every 10m. It will become very hard to run a Bitcoin node because it will require so much storage, this will lead to only a handful of people taking part to the network. The big issue is that security and integrity 100% relies on decentralization which require a lot of different people on the network, so this means the currency will become unsafe and ultimately no one will use it anymore. More on this by Andreas Antonopoulos [here](
- [This article]( explains the block size limit is meant to prevent miners from attacking the network by making huge blocks. Currently almost all the mining is centralized in huge mining pools, and almost no individuals are mining on their own because it's not profitable without professional hardware. So removing the block size limit would allow miners to attack the network at a time they have a good incentive to do so. If the limit is to be removed, it should not be done now but at a time where some rules in the Bitcoin system have been changed to make sure no one has any incentive to attack the network.
- There are other arguments as well, you can find some [here]( though the page is a bit technical.
In short, increasing the block size is considered as dangerous for the mid-term security and integrity of the currency.

My 2 satoshis : no one has missed the boat yet because
- We're still far from mass adoption 
- Bitcoin is deflationary by design
- So far every spike in value makes the previous ones ridiculous in comparison
If you really don't care about losing these 5K, I'd say go for it and hodl for like 6 months, we may have a dip in early 2018 like previous years but it will most likely go back up after. **But** as everyone says, no one knows what will happen.
If you stress about it maybe think twice because hodling is done good when not thinking (too much) about the coin :D

I recommend watching this interesting video by Andreas Antonopoulos about Bitcoin energy consumption : 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:00:16
Yep, I suggest starting downloading the blockchain from your regular computer a few days before setting up the RPi, so you can copy it instead of downloading it from scratch.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:08:10
For now there is no direct incentive other than helping maintaining decentralization... and having fun in my case because I like tinkering around with this :D
I read somewhere Satoshi was aware this only was not sufficient as an incentive for running a full node, maybe the Bitcoin team will find a way to boost it somehow.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:03:33
Yep, fees are very high right now. If you have the time for the read, [this]( should help you understand why.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:34:51
It's very low price. If you can afford to lose these $200 without any ROI I'd say have a go, just get as much information as you can from the reseller (why are they selling, maybe they're just moving to a new place where power is too expensive for mining..).
Out of curiosity, from your practical experience how much BTC can one expect from an Antminer S9 today ?
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:09:54
- For exchanges and wallets, I think the major issue is they lack time as Bitcoin is booming and they need to handle their own scaling issues too, so implementing Segwit means more immediate work for them.
- For some miners, adopting Segwit is earning less money because they can't use the ASIC BOOST exploit anymore (it was a weakness in Bitcoin that allowed to mine using less power).
- Lower transaction fees
- It's the basis for a lot of features which will help a lot for scaling up
- If you have the time to read, more about this (and other features) [here](

Great ! Happy to help :D
Yes, syncing the blockchain is quite long because it's ~150GB.
The full sync time depends a lot on your connection, it can take maybe like 1 week (wild guess). I actually run a full node on my regular computer too (which is up when I need to use it, otherwise it's shutdown) so the blockchain is always updated or almost on this computer. If you can, I suggest starting doing this a few weeks or days before you plan to setup your RPi, then you can copy the blockchain to it and configure Bitcoin Core's data folder accordingly, so you skip the download part.

Bernard Lietaer (economist) explains [here]( that we need to build a monetary ecosystem with multiple currencies, because this is the way to have economic resilience (which is basically the ability to resist things like Internet going down).
Big currencies today do have a very low resilience, which is why there have been so many crashes worldwide since they exist.
I think even if Bitcoin becomes the main currency, physical money will still exist. Not necessarily controlled by banks though, there are a lot of ongoing experiments with local currencies like the [Bristol Pound](

This is still way better than centralized exchanges who must log everything and deliver to NSA if asked.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:58:58
I don't think he's lying. Bitcoin is booming so all exchanges need to scale up too, it's a big deal for them. I think they have higher priority in keeping up with the demand than supporting new features like Segwit. Also any change requires a lot of time because their business requires the highest level of security.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:39:58
I don't have a very deep knowledge of Schnorr signatures but here's what I know. Currently input and output addresses can account for a big part of a transaction's weight, especially in transactions which have a lot of input and output addresses (because in a single transaction you can send coins from multiple addresses to multiple addresses).
With Schnorr signatures, all input and output addresses will basically be "summed-up" into a single input "Schnorr address" and a single output "Schnorr address". This will remove all the overhead weight caused by having a lot of different inputs and outputs in transactions.
Currently, spammers can use huge transactions with very low btc amounts and a lot of addresses, as these eat up a lot of space in the size-limited blocks, so other transactions can't fit in and people will need to pay more if they want their transaction confirmed before the others. With Schnorr signatures, this kind of spam attack will become totally useless.
You can find more about Schnorr signatures [here]( about the spam attacks [here]( and [here]( and transactions fees [here](

I recommend watching some [Andreas Antonopoulos videos]( about Bitcoin, his insights are priceless for having some clues about Bitcoin's future.
Also if you have the time, you might want to read [this]( about scaling.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:33:40
I forgot to mention SegWit. SegWit is a feature that has already been deployed this year. It kind of increases the Bitcoin "transation pipe" to double its previous size. So using a SegWit wallet reduces fees you pay. Unfortunately most exchanges still don't support SegWit yet, so we have to wait for them to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:16:05
Fun :D
I read somewhere Satoshi thought there need to be more as an incentive for running a full node, maybe the Bitcoin team will get this sorted out.

The miner decides, not the network. The miner is also a full node, so it has a lot of non-yet-confirmed transactions in his mempool. As far as I know, there are no enforced rules on which transaction must be included, so it can pick whatever transaction it wants to add in the block. Obviously, most miners choose transactions with higher fees because they earn the fees.
Triva : some miners are purposedly choosing transactions very low fees that are emitted to congest the network and increase fees. This should be fixed when the "Schnorr signatures" update will be released in 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:39:37
Too much people are using bitcoin right now, and some miners are spamming the network with transactions to increase fees. This will be fixed in future Bitcoin upgrades. Learn more [here](

I suggest getting a Raspberry Pi with Raspbian and an external 1TB HD for running a full node. I've been doing so for a year, it worked great until the blockchain size exceeded the 128GB of my SD card. I'm going to upgrade to a 1TB external drive. 
This should be the cheapest option, with lowest power consumption for 24/7 uptime.
For wallet security use a cold/paper wallet along with 1 hot wallet if you need to spend. 
For the hot wallet as long as you avoid Windows OS you're much safer than most users. According to Andreas Antonopoulos, Android is alright.
I love his take on "don't store more value in your hot wallet than you would be comfortable having as cash in your pocket".
If you need to spend often, get a hardware wallet, it's the most secure.
My rules of thumb :
* Private key loss is the biggest cause of btc loss I think. Use a brainwallet (with a seed) and make sure you don't lose your seed even in case of events like fire, etc.
* Never backup your seed in any digital way, always physically.
* Make sure no one can steal it either.
* Always encrypt your digital wallets with strong passwords. In case files are stolen, encryption still protects your private keys.
Read more on this, get comfortable before dealing with big amounts of money. Some links that helped me :

We have to put this in context.
- Major exchange are currently overwhelmed by demand and must have the best security for all these coins. They are having scaling issues too. Otherwise they would have implemented SegWit to save fee money.
- Some big miners don't want to support the SegWit update because it fixes the ASICBOOST exploit which makes them earn more money.
- Bitcoin as an ecosystem is doing things never done by anyone before, it's normal to have issues. We might hope that for the next big update, wallets will update faster.
- Regardless of what's available, we all know users rarely update their own software.

For Bitcoin: nodes validate transactions, miners confirm validated transactions (by packing them into blocks).
If you just launch Bitcoin Core you will be running a full node, without mining. You need to enable mining if you want to do so. Today, mining on a regular computer won't be useful because miners will have several orders of magnitude advantage over you with their specialized hardware, so you won't have enough hashpower to compete.
Andreas Antonopoulos thinks this will change in the upcoming years (learn more about mining centralization [here]( and [here](
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:37:58
Just wait but don't worry, your money won't be lost. It will either don't move (transaction dropped from mempool), or eventually be validated.
I made a low fee transaction 10 days ago, seems like it was dropped today.

I recommend not scanning a QR code unless you know what it represents and why the app wants you to scan it, to avoid ending up losing money.
Let's break this down, there are quite a few things to understand.
1. Coinomi needs your Bitcoin private key to sweep the coins to a BCH wallet.
2. Mycelium is a "Brainwallet". That means you don't directly know any private key, but you get a "seed" instead. Mycelium generates multiple addresses and private keys from this seed, this is why you don't need to backup the keys, only the seed.
4. Normally you would never share your seed or private keys with anyone or any program, because anyone knowing them could steal your money. Also you never want to backup a private key or a seed on a computer or mobile phone, always on paper, otherwise it's too easy for a virus to read them and steal your money.
5. Mycelium has no feature to show you the private keys. This is for security. This is why you need to use the "BIP39 tool", this will use the same algorithm than Mycelium to recover the private keys from the seed.
6. Before entering a seed or private key into such a program, you have to make sure it will not steal your coins. This program seems legit as it is open source and we can see [here]( (linked from the coinomi page) that a lot of people used it, and check if they had any issues.
7. When you are sure you want to do this (do not trust me or anyone on this, make your own research), before doing it you may want to remove all your BTC from the whole wallet as you will expose the seed (right now you're doing this for BCH but your BTC wallet has the same seed so you need to make sure your BTC are safe). You wrote that you already removed all the coins from the address, but this includes all the coins on all addresses in this wallet, so make sure the whole Mycelium wallet does not hold any coin anymore. If Mycelium is showing "0 BTC" you should be ok.
8. Now you're ready to retrieve your keys. For best security you would want to do this on a computer which does not run a Windows OS, and disable any network connection. Get the "BIP39 tool" on this computer with a USB stick, open it with a web browser and type your seed in. It will give you multiple pairs : [address (also called public key), private key].
9. Locate the address on which you had Bitcoin before the fork. The private key next to this address is the one you will need to enter into Coinomi to sweep it.
10. If you have multiple addresses on which you had Bitcoin, repeat for all of them.
11. Never use any address of this wallet in the future. You can keep the seed backup though, because if another fork happens in the future you may want to get the coins as well.
If you have only low value on your addresses and you do not care much if someone steals your coins, you may skip some security steps (extensive research for the BIP39 tool, using a non-Windows computer), because they make things more complicated and take time. If you have enough time however, I recommend doing so because if you need to do this with high value one day, you'll be less likely to mess things up and lose your money.
Once again be sure to be comfortable with all of this before proceeding. If you are not in a hurry, I suggest taking it slow, and taking a few days to make sure you are ok with all of this.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:10:52
You can do this with Coinomi as [explained here](
Sweeping an address means sending all the coins on it to another address. Be careful not to get confused between your BTC keys/addresses and your BTG and BCH keys/addresses. Never send BTC to a BTG address because it will be lost.
 
Before exposing your private key from Electrum, I recommand moving your BTC to another wallet (which kind of sucks because fees are currently very high).
Another thing : I don't like using "claiming" for this, technically you already own your BTG and BCH because they were in the blockchain at the time of the fork. They are already yours. You just need to transfer them to another wallet so you can use them.

I've been doing this for ~1 year, worked like a charm. I just underestimated the blockchain growth so now I need to upgrade my storage from 128GB SD card to 1TB HD.
It's most likely the cheapest setup for a 24/7 full node. You just need the RPi (+power supply and case), a ~8GB SD card, and a 1TB external HD. Total for around 100 USD.
There are a few tutorials out there, such as

The responsibility is mainly keeping it running, i.e. checking once a day or once a week if it's up and if it is connected to other nodes. You may also try to climb [the nodes leaderboard]( to make sure your node is as useful as possible for the network.
The main costs are bandwidth, power, CPU and disk usage.
- The network consumption is high (several 100's of GB/month), you can set a limit and the node will try to keep the network usage lower. Pay attention to that if you have a limited data plan.
- Keeping your main computer on for a node can increase your power bill significantly depending on where you live, as well as decrease your computer lifespan. As others stated, setting up a node on a Raspberry Pi is the cheapest way to go, but it requires some set up. There are quite a few tutorials for this, just ask if you're interested.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:38:05
Exactly ! Looking back it's so easy to be bitter about not entering at the right time during a dip or a crash, but trying to do it just as it happens is another thing.
I agree with OP, gradually investing is the easiest way. You can also weight your periodic investment depending on whether the price is relatively high or low.
