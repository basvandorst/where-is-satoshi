i hate to say it, but with what we've seen with this whole block size debate, I feel like it's putting a nail into bitcoins coffin. Who knows, maybe the winning crypto will be essentially feature equivalent with Bitcoin to start out with but have a single or small group of devs to lead the project, set its goals, etc. Because consensus driven  is not working.

So, if developer A introduces software that may or may not cause a hard fork to occur in the future, and Developer B, completely unrelated, writes a software wallet that works with Bitcoin as it stands right now, but includes code so that it will work in the event that the fork occurs, then Bitcoin.org won't support it?

When the block size increases to 8mb, that doesn't mean that blocks will be 8 MB, when there only .5 MB today. If the transactions aren't there, then blocks will continue to be the size they always were, it's just that they'll be capable of becoming bigger should there be a need/demand. 
So much of what I read seems to think that these larger blocks are guaranteed to be filled. They're not. The only reason they would be is if we're all transacting enough to do so.

Absolutely. This whole discussion should be between devs, pool operators, and the few really big Bitcoin enterprises (bit pay, coin base, huobi, btc china, circle, etc). People who aspire to run full nodes on raspberry pi's and other low-powered, legacy hardware 5 years from now needn't be involved, nor the majority of us users who use SPV wallets). 
This is an infrastructure issue, not a issue for the non-technical masses to debate and chime in on. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:52:22
So, for the sake of argument, we all know we're discussing Bitcoin XT.
My understanding that upon initial deployment, it'll behave exactly the same as every other node, only that it'll relay an additional bit of data within its block notating that that the transactions in that block were bundled together and related by XT. If/when a majority of blocks bear that tag, then those nodes will start producing larger blocks when the number of transactions allows. 
 
Merchants, wallet provides, mining pool operators, etc can all monitor this, and if they see an uptick in interest/support for the proposal, they can start readying their softwares to work with the larger sized blocks if a majority of the blocks being relayed are coming from nodes that could handle the larger ones. 
Am I right so far?
So, even with support for larger blocks, XT nodes would behave 100% cooperatively/compatibly with official Bitcoin infrastructure. The software switch that would cause any changes to occur only will flip once th majority of nodes are already compatible. 
It doesn't sound too disruptive, honestly, seems like democracy in action. Watching this whole debate uncurl, a question that's bounced through my mind is who exactly needs to approve for there to be an official consensus? 
A set of developers who post the most code that's accepted/used by the official Bitcoin reference software?
Those designated by the Bitcoin foundation?
Mining pool operators?
Miners themselves?
Node operators?
Exchange operators?
Online wallet providers?
Anyone that owns some Bitcoin?
Even that much hasn't been defined. Without knowing who's vote counts, it's impossible to know who consensus needs to be built among. And lacking knowledge of even that, seems like the only way to find out anything meaningful is to make the software available and see what the community's reaction is to it. If the majority of the community sticks by the "official" reference implantation, then the community has spoken. And if the majority of the community switches to software capable of working with larger blocks, then again, the community has spoken. 
Seems like the fairest way to accomplish this
Without a leader like satoshi or Linus, someone ultimately and acknowledged to be responsible for setting the direction, whT better than to have the users themselves figure it out? 
And why should certain software be banned for supporting a feature that will only get activated if the majority of the network can handle it?
What am I missing?

Yes, you CAN do that. Maybe, I mean. Like not if the host country is going to arrest, fine or jail any unlicensed currency exchangers
In the first world, it's really easy to envision doing all of this, til you realize that FINCEN would have your hide if you tried to do it here. And third world countries are often times have even more stringent capital controls. Yes, foreign exchangers operate, but with very strict oversight, as their governments are often petrified by the thought of capital flight.
And again, thinking realistically, I'd bet that nobody in that picture has heard of bitcoin before. Certainly no shops on that street accept bitcoin. So convincing them that they want bitcoin rather than dollars or their local currency, it's going to be a tougher sell. Not to mention selling an online-only/internet currency to people who haven't got computers probably doesn't make the greatest of sense. Sure, there's bitcoin over SMS, I keep  hearing about that, but have any security experts actually reviewed the concept? Or are we going to convince everyone in the third world to want bitcoin, and as soon as we've given them all bitcoin, we learn that russian cybercriminals have simultaneously emptied each and every one of their wallets.
That's my big fear, and why, while I HOPE that the tools surrounding bitcoin get easier to use and more reliable in the future, when you read postings with regularity on here, on bitcointalk, etc about people, early adopters/techies, losing all their bitcoins to a heist, I think "geez, if we can't keep out bitcoins safe knowing everything we know, what hope will the non-computer savy have incepting their coins safe?"

A snapshot is perfectly adequate, whether there is margin or not. For one, it's the customers who are out on margin, not the firm. If the act of loaning funds or coins to customers made it impossible to ascertain total assets or liabilities of an exchange, all I can say is that it'd be astonishing. 
You're onto something when saying that these proofs of reserve aren't worth squat, but you're barking up the wrong tree by concentrating on this notion that margin makes things too much more complicated for the exchanges side of things.

Yeah, I think that Bitcoin has tremendous opportunity in the remittance marketplace, but unfortunately, too many advocates aren't addressing reality, such as comparing the cost to send money via western union to the cost of transferring bitcoins from point A to B, without including the cost of converting those said bitcoins to a local currency so that the recipient can actually spend their money. And not including the cost is one thing, but not even mentioning that there will be one. R
Second, many in the community need to step back on their hostilities. Again, being that bitcoins can't really buy very many things in the third world, it should be pretty clear that while Bitcoin can take over the remittance market, it will have a much better chance at doing so by working with the established players rather than thoughtlessly attacking them.
A Bitcoin remmitance business is going to need a lot of capital outlays. Retail locations throughout the countries you want to serve. Registration with proper authorities to operate a funds transfer business. Cash on hand at each location to pay out to recipients. Phones. Computers. I'm sure the list is a lot Longer. 
What do we think has a better chance at catching on, a few guys and their kickstarter project to start a remmitance business? Or the community working with western Union, selling them the benefits of working with Bitcoin, and effectively letting Bitcoin piggy-back on WU's infrastructure,
A great staring point would be for WU to establish wallet addresses for each of their customers. I want to send money to my grandmother in Indonesia? I send btcs to her wU address without leaving my home. WU receives Bitcoin to address, sells them/exchanges rhem to local currency transfers proceeds to grandmothers WU branches bank account to replenish their in store reserves. And again, upon seeing coins hit her WU/btc address, western Union makes an automated call to her informing her that there is cash available to be picked up at the store. 
Which business sounds more promising? Do we want western Union to refuse to contemplate Bitcoin because of our communities childish antics?

Compared to stocks, arbitrage with bitcoin is incredibly tedious.  And with no ability to buy long in one market and sell short in another, you're open to huge amounts of risk. It's not really arbitrage anymore, just wiring money to an exchange and crossing your Fingers that the funds arrive so that you can make your purchase, transfer those coins to a different exchange and make a sale and hoping the price discrepancy holds long enough to make a profit and that the price of bit coin overall doesn't move against you and wipe out any potential profits. 
Compare that to arbitraging stocks or bonds and you'll see that it's a completely different game.

I think the biggest impact that Bitcoin could have is reducing the time and interaction by both sender and the branch that they're using.
As i said in a different post, the best-case scenario I can see for bitcoin  and remittances is that one of the major players moves to integrate Bitcoin, Western Union, even.
The way it would work as follows:
My grandmother lives in the Philines, and I send her the greater of 25% of $50 from each of my weekly paychecks. Western Union notices my sending habits and says "you send money to the same recipient every week; we could set this up so that it would be cheaper for you to send AND more convenient, you won't even need to come to our office anymore"
Sign me up!
So, WU creates a bitcoin wallet address on behalf of my grandmother. Now, whenever I want to send her money, I just send Bitcoins to that address; once the coins hit that address and generate a few confirmations, their system makes an automated call to her inform her that there is money be picked up. The coins are sold as soon as there are enough confirmations for an exchange to accept the sale.
Western Union benefits because their staff doesn't need to process the forms I'd usually need to fill out at their store; instead, all the information is saved and is automatically populated into their database the moment their systems detect my coins hitting their BTC address for her.
Likewise, they don't need to have a fraud allowance. Whereas I COULD pay via credit credit card on their site, there's always the risk that the person that's entering an order into the computer isn't who they purport to be. There's the risk that someone is uses my card to send their cousin $1000; their cousin in the philipines picks up those funds, and  when i see the charge on my next statement, I dispute the purchase, and WU is out that $1,000. Me paying in bitcoin assures them that that can't happen.
So between the employee not needing to interact with me, key in information that i filled out on a form, etc, AND they don't need to worry about being on the losing end of a fraudulent charge. In order to nudge     me into doing that, they cut their fees if i'm willing to work with them via bitcoin.
That's the biggest way that I can see that Bitcoin could enter the remittance market place and immediately cause a splash.
Too many people around here seem to think that remittance is just sending money across borders and, as we saw, make themselves look fools when they say that bitcoin transfers are cheaper than $5 western union transfers, because they convienetly omit the fact that Western Union delivers to the recipient their local currency, ready to be spent, whereas a bitcoin transfer still needs to be converted to local currency before it can be spent. Unless and until grocers and other retailers in the 3rd world accept Bitcoin, simply transferring bitcoin is not comparable to conducting an actual remittance.
@_date: 2014-03-06 07:56:53
You send the bitcoin in less time than it takes to hand over cash. Sure, I'll agree there. But the merchant likely hasn't even gotten a single confirmation that your coins are valid before you've driven out of the parking lot.

I think it's an unreasonable proposition.  
CoinbSe can have several businesses to make money - exchanging dollars for bitcoins
acting as a payment gateway - people pay bitcoins for a purchase and coinbase can immediately sell them and transfer cah tot the merchant
Or they could even host the entire shopping cart, and upon completion of checkout, transfer the bitcoins to the merchant. 
At this point, I would say that ANY service that opens its doors with a business plan where they hold bitcoins on behalf of others for an extended time either fails to understand the inherent risks of bitcoin or else they're planning to steal those coins. 
There's no reason for companies to try to hold onto customer balances - the more they cold, the bigger a target they will be for hackers, and those hackers WILL eventually win - all it takes is for the wallet provider to mess up one time and those coins are gone.

You do realize that taxing spending would basically flip the tax code upside down.
Say there is a flat 20% "spending tax"
You've got John, who earns $15k per year, and is always outside his means, so his debt goes up by $2k per year. He earns $15k but spends $17. His 20% spending tax actually means that he's paying 22.66% tax on what he earned.
Then you have Julie, who earns $40k and spends $40k. Her 20% spending tax is in equilibrium.
Then you've got George. He earns $700k, spends $350k and banks/invests the rest. His 20% spending tax equates to a 10% tax on his income.
And then you've got Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan. He pulled in a cool $20 million in 2013. Lets say he spent $2 million of it. His 20% spending tax works out to a 2% tax on income.
Lets do that again.
Earnings               Spending                 Eff tax on income
-----------         -------------                   -----------------
$15k                      $17k                             22%
$40k                      $40k                             20%
$700,000               $350,000                       10%
$20 million            $2 million                        2%
Is that what you're hoping for? Tax the criminals a little bit, crank up the tax rate of the poorest people and drop the tax rates of the wealthy like there's no tomorrow? Because that's what a "spending tax" will get you.

Why should the value of bitcoin be tied to the speculative value of what it'd be worth if a few thousand people all suddenly chose to make enormous (relatively speaking) investments in it?  Doesn't make much sense. Nor does the hope that their money managers might be inclined to out them in bitcoin - clearly, if they were to make investments in bitcoin of that magnitude, it would be of great benefit to those of us that already are invested, but where would future "growth" come from so that those folks might see a return on their money?
It's always nice to think "if only x people would buy and hold bitcoins" and focusing that hope on the ultrawealthy makes it seem even more achievable, but at the end of the day, there's no benefit to them for making such investments, just to us for selling them some of our coins for vastly inflated prices

How many more thefts will we need to see before people stop thinking they can use an exchange like a wallet? Give them your cash, get your bit coins, then take them out and keep them under your own personal control. That's how it has to be. And with them under your own control, the only way to transact is on the block chain.

I'm saying that I am in the U.S.. I have a job, I have a bank account. I need to send money to my grandmother, who is in the Philippines (or some other tropical locale), and she is an "unbanked" individual.
Currently, to send money to her, I'd need to go to the Western Union office, or a store that processes Western Union transfers - keep in mind, those stores don't charge you any more than you pay it you deal with WU directly, but they're not handling these transfers for free - Western Union is paying them a slice of the fee that's collected, so any way that WU can encourage people to deal with them directly rather that at a supermarket or convenience store, that's extra income to them.
But back to the story. I have a bank account, my grandmother does not. To transfer money to her, I go to a WU location, fill out the paperwork, bring it to the counter, pay the cashier, stand and wait while the cashier types in everything I wrote down, double check the print out she gives me, approve it. Then I call my grandmother to let her know that Ive sent funds to her.
In alternative scenario, WU sees that I'm often paying the same lady every week. They want me to stop going to the store and where they get less of their fee. So, they say, how about we set it up so that you can send money to your grandmother whenever you want, you never have to enter a WU storefront again, and it'll cost you less money on top of all that?
Sign me up, I say.
So, they establish a bitcoin address for my grandmother. It's actually a part of the Western Union wallet, but this address is specifically for my grandmother - any funds that are sent to it are automatically designated to be for her.
The next week, I get paid and a scheduled coinbase purchase occurs, debiting my bank account for the amount that I would have sent her. I then login to coinbase and send those coins to the address that WU provided me as being "her" address. On WU's side, their software routinely scans their wallet - as soon as it picks up my transfer to her address, then immediately credit her with the dollar value of the bitcoins that were received, and go ahead and sell those bitcoins on an exchange. They then call my grandmother informing her that funds they are in receipt of funds for her. That night, or the next day, she walks to the WU office in Manilla and collects her funds, the funds that I sent as bitcoin the day before.
As for the forms; no, you don't need to re-fillout the same forms over and over, legally. WU just needs to have your identity on file and the recipients identity. If we've consented for them to store that info in their DB, it can be pulled and associated withe our transactions evertime we initiate them.
The contrast to credit cards is simply to protect against fraudulent activity. You have to be sure that WU loses quite a bit of money every year to fraud - person in country A sending money to person in Country B with a stolen CC. By the time the credit card holder realizes and charges back both of the accomplices are long gone. If WU were to accept bitcoin, they would be assured that, of the portion of their transactions done in bitcoin, there would be a zero percent chance of chargeback.
TL/DR - The remittance sender more than likely has a bank account; not every country has turned their migrant workforce into illegal immigrants. So yes, they get paid, they obtain bitcoin with their money, send the coin to WU, WU sells the coin and delivers local currency to the person I sent money to.
Please read what I've written this time... Like, I don't understand how you assume that if the sender of the remittance has a bank account or credit card with which to obtain bitcoin, how that affects the recipient half a world away...

If your Bitcoin client routes it's connection through Tor, then bad actors can conduct all sorta of mischief against you. I don't imagine they could steal coins, though, as Bitcoin over Tor doesn't magically expose your private keys. But said bad actors can delay or prevent you from sending transactions, just for starters.

Bailout which prevented our country from falling into an abyss, you mean?

No one wished to see that event repeat itself over and over with all the other banking institutions. And note, it worked.

I guess my point is that that shouldn't even be a question in the first place. 
Allowing a customer to verify that their own balance was included is all fine and dandy, the real question is how do customers verify that all the other customers balances were also included?
Ultimately, exchanges need to drop this whole notion of "proof of reserves" which basically proves next to nothing - sure it's generally conducted or verified by a trustworthy member of the community, but as well meaning as that member or those members might be, they're essentially performing a cursory audit, and to do that, you/they need real training, not just a glance at the block chain.
One day, hopefully sooner rather than later, one of these exchanges should enlist a real accounting firm and undergo a real audit. Not a proof of reserves, but obtain a formal opinion from an actual trained auditor. Hopefully one of these exchanges will do so proactively, but I fear that more likely it'll be done as part of a post-Mortem procedure (ie "how in the world could this have happened? They had their proof of reserves published and everything, yet at the end of the days, customer funds still went misusing"

They don't need to borrow anything - they've got the coin on hand from an account holder, and the seller of that position gets their cash from the buyer of that position. That's how brokerages work. The lending so either come from the inventory of other margin customers, the inventory of the firm itself, or (zin the world of stocks) borrowing from other firms and their customers. 
All of this is transparent to the customer. Unless you're a really big fish you have no idea if your securities have been leant out, nor do you mine the source of stocks that were borrowed for you on margin.

That 109,000% gain was only available to the very few people around since the beginning, which, I think, include none of the people looking that far back to demonstrate that Bitcoin has not been a successful investment for most of the time that it's been in the public eye. 
That spike to $1000 was almost an undoing. Clearly manipulated to get there, yet everyone wishes back for that instant. Meanwhile, if Bitcoin had grown organically from $100 then to the price it is now, it'd have been a stupendous investment. Unfortunately, no. It spiked and has spend the ensuing year and change to find it's true value. Which no one knows what it is, except every time people think it's stabilized, it creeps lower.

Fiverrs not claiming the processing fee is from the Bitcoin network, or their payment processor, so I wouldn't call it fraudulent, especially since it's Bitcoin - they're not sneaking a new charge in unexpectedly, the buyer is pushing the payment to them, if they have an objection to the 50 cent fee (which Fiverr will probably say is due to having to have dedicated staff to handle bitcoin transactions, or who knows...).

I think I understood the post. I said that letting people direct their donations to specific debelopers would force developers to take on a marketing type roll in order for the public to know about their efforts and therefore to donate to them. Developers who didn't take that marketing approach would lose out on donations to ones that did, which could fuel resentment or potentially draw developers attention away from coding as their number one priority. 
Of for dispensing funds and letting them sort it out, im not saying to give it all to Gavin and let him allocate it, but construct a method (an application) whereby ALL developers would vote on their own and everyone else's funding. 
Devekoper A gets votes for $6k $8k and $10k, he gets $8k
Devekoper B gets votes for $20k, $25k and 22.5k, he gets $22.5k and so forth. 
I don't think anyone else can be a better judge of individual contributions and needs than the developers themselves, and encouraging donations to individual names rather than the group as a whole would lead to the most well known names accruing all of the benefit to the detriment of those that didn't have the Spotlight shone on them.

I don't think being a consultant is arduous to software developers. Most have done contract work in the past so it's not a new situation to be in. 
More so, with donators naming who they think should get the funds, how is that at all fair or equitable; were all just looking at the project from the outside, not seeing behind the scenes contributions, discussions, etc. 
Look at Linux. Probably hundreds of people have contributed code to the kernel. Now name more than 5 of them besides Linus? What do you think will happen to morale if developers who keep their heads down and code see that other ones are taking to the net, giving interviews etc in order to gain name recognition, and therefore reap the lions share of donations? Seems like a sure fire way to create resentment and disention
If you want to form a trust to benefit the core devs, fine. But leave it at that, and if the funds are to be evenly distributed empower someone to allocate the donations based on a set criteria (lines of code... No. Time devoted? Perhaps. How about have the devs themselves vote about how to allocate the funds, rather than end users who might know one or two names but certainly aren't in a position to judge eAch of their contributions.

Nearly impossible to audit; you can't take a million numbers generated by a random number generator and say "yes, this is truly random output". It can appear so, but no way to test it.

Depends who's doing the defending. 
If it's a knc/asicminer type operation where they can deploy miners at cost, then the cost to defend would be a lot less than to attack; there's already a ton of legitimate hashing ower on the network, so they just need to tip the scales back to having greater than 51% and transactions can still go on. Dont know how that would work out for innocent people solely connected to malicious nodes feeding malicious miners though...
On the other hand, if defending the network is done by individuals and end purchasers, the cost to defend it could be a lot more than the cost to attack it; miner manufacturers have a lot of profit margin, essentially selling their hardware for what it could be expected to mine over 6-12 months, far more than their actual costs. So if people buying retail or even wholesale need to defend against an attaxker paying cost, they'll quickly be outgunned.

When I look at the costs of chip production in general, I imagine the cost to attach the network today is far lower than is imagined. Certainly far less than a billion. What'll it cost in the future? Good question. But still, probably far less than anyone imagines. I'm certain a couple billion could overwhelm the network now and for quite some time into the future. So no, I wouldn't just assume it'll be safe. Though I don't think any country should adopt Bitcoin either, but if they were planning to, I hope they look at the costs of an attack more deeply than just looking at the retail price of a miner.

But at the end of the day, if you take the sums earned by all trades, you won't even see a break even, you'll see less money leaving the system than entered it, due to exchanges taking their piece. 
Yes, people can be opportunistic and make money. But know it's impossible to make money trading without someone else losing. so unless you have real confidence you'll be one of the winners, you're likely to end up being one of the people sustaining the winners' gains

It's not. It's a "flight to safety" maneuver, plain Nd simple. Businesses, banks, funds, pensions and the like who have cash far exceeding an insurance amount at a bank are buying short term government debt instead of parking their cash. To that end, they're buying €100 notes that mature in a year for €101. Guaranteed loss, but they don't need to worry about the solvency of banks, and assume the governments will make good on the notes. 
I don't see why the headline about mass default is there, though. Negative rates are a boon to borrowers. It does show how fearful those investors are of leaving their cash in banks, however.

There's a place in my town, kava bar, who's owner is libertarian pro Bitcoin, etc. had a sign up "bitcoins accepted here". Asked to pay with btc, but alas, with so little demand, he hadn't shown his employees what to do. That sign had been up for months, and they said I was the first to ask. Im told they take them for online sales though. 
The problem with all these maps is they need constant pinging and refreshing; someone might have signed them up a year ago and then lost interest 
Either people in those cities need to check up on them and have them removed if they arent accepting (no, no just leave a feedback entry... We don't want a map littered with places that took them in the past. Or the map service need to continuously poll each vendor. Like every month, and email that says "click this link to maintain your listing, or else you'll get kicked off"

I'm having a tough time getting sympathy for OP. I agree that the Cold storage procedure could have been spelled out better, and certainly the CTO ought to write more professionally. But I understand the points they make. 
Cryptocoins aren't like dollars, fdic insured and replaceable. If coins go missing, an exchange would have to dig into their own pockets if they wanted to make their customers whole. Obviously, if an account appears to be in disuse, steps can be taken to better secure it. 
And again, things could have been communicated better. 
But to say they're trying to steal coins, when they clearly show a record of the transfer and return the funds without argument when you ask for them to be restored, that doesn't jive with theft. 
Likewise, ordinary customer service reps should have no access to cold storage. No argument there. 
If anything, what it does do is provide evidence that they're not operating in a fractional reserve style; if you'd emailed requesting access to your funds and those funds were made available to your account immediately, despite not being actually transfered from cold to hot storage, that wouldbe a much bigger cause for concern.
So yes, they should spell out their procedures better. But that's about all I can see being wrong, despite OP raising the hugest stink about it.

Well, if you see no point in spending your bitcoin because you can't chargeback, what in the world are you doing holding on to it, and why do you think that it'll have any value in the future? If you can't do without those protections, then no one else will either...
You just made a great argument for why Bitcoin shouldn't catch on. 
"Hey, we've got this great currency. Merchants should give us discounts so they can get their hands on it. Of course, I won't spend it, because I lose the protections I get with fiat. But you should buy and invest in it and make my coins worth more, because it's awesome. Even though clearly I think it's not. But don't pay attention to what I actually do, just what I say."
I don't usually come out strong, but I'd encourage you to rethink your stance on bitcoin, because you're contradictory to even yourself.
For instance, you said:
*Eventually merchants will understand bitcoin and will actively try to get their hands on yours, **by offering discounts** and other incentives.*
Then I said:
*That vendor might be like "cool! **I'll offer discounts** to others that'll pay in Bitcoin!"*
To which you reply:
*"No he won't! **Why would he offer a discount when everyone is happily paying full price**? These are businesses, they don't give away money."*
What is it? Are you insane? Multiple personalities? Because you're basically saying bitcoins awesome, but it sucks, and arguing against the very premises that you suggested.

Bitcoin is "readily" available to people with computers and with access to traditional banking. In the third world, with no computers and no bank accounts to link to exchange accounts, that's not the case. Even exchanging Bitcoin for fiat is likely a challenge. And transacting in it, without live prices, would be an added challenge. 
Plus there's thr while security thing. Are you expecting people use online wallets and leave themselves open to first world hackers? Or keep their wallets on their phones and be subject to risks of robbery, lost or broken devices, etc. 
Not to mention the sheer volatility. People here can stomach that volatility because often it's just their "play money" that's committed to Bitcoin, but even if it went to zero, they would still have food and shelter. People in the third world don't have that luxury. They might be earning sustenance wages, they can't affird a 10 or more percent drop in a single day.

To someone with no idea what Bitcoin is. $100 more on a $5k wire is meaningless. And it causes them to have to do z lot more work, set up account with exchange, link to bank account, possibly do KYC stuff, dealing with spreads on their side of the transaction, along with the added wait time to actually get funds in their currency of choice into their bank account. 
But really, the nerve of your bank to ask you how to address the wire. As if they should know who you're sending money to. Or have the wire instructions for every bank in the world committed to Memory. 
If it was a crypto enthusiast, sure, great! But someone in another country, needing funds in their fiat currency, offering them Bitcoin only adds headache an inconvenience, unless you offered a substantial premium to account for the risk they're taking on, as well as the time it'll take to learn,effect, and finalize the transaction so that they have their currency of choice.

I'll echo other sentiments. If you believe in Bitcoin and think it's the future, demand to spend your coins now. Only by getting others interested and demanding to be paid with Bitcoin, will Bitcoin really grow. 
Pay your vendor. Then be like "hey, not only didn't you pay a credit card processing fee, you also don't need to worry about charge backs". That vendor might be like "cool! I'll offer discounts to others that'll pay in Bitcoin!"  Then you have new people saying to themselves "I need to get Bitcoin so I can save money when i ship". And what's that? Increased demand thAts what. 
For the life of me I don't get why all the holders don't understand that logic. It's not like they'll lose their coins by spending them - it you buy something for $300 and pay in Bitcoin, go rebut what you just spent. You end up even and you helped the Bitcoin economy grow. And only by it growing will its value increase in a sustainable way.

If you put your cash in the bank, you'd lose only a small portion of that.
If you put your cash in TIPS (Inflation protected bonds), you'd have the same purchasing power as when you started, plus the interest on top of that.
And if you put your cash in equities, well, you'd have blown away the other returns.
But most important, so long as you don't just keep your cash under your mattreess, you'll at worst close to the rate of inflation. Each dollar will be worth less, yes, but you'll have a whole lot more of them....
Yes, we're in a zero interest rate environment currently... But that won't last forever... Once we start seeing inflation again, we'll see interest rates rise.

Tax authorities in lots of countries are going to want visibility on their citizens transactions for tax collection purposes. Not surprising.
It's just that Bitcoin, by way of it's architecture, can end up revealing a lot more than what what gets reported by banks and brokerages.... Probably, though, as authorities see that exchanges aren't playing fast and loose with reporting requirements, they'll accept what's reported by exchanges at face value. Right now, the whole concept is very new, and there are some very vocal anti tax voices so tax authorities probanly want an extra clear view to make sure everyone is reporting things properly. 
Or we could just call them fascists.

They said there was a dead Japanese on the final ridge before the summit. A team of 6 or 10 climbers went up to retrieve him. They only managed to move him less than 100 ft and had to stop from exhaustion. Nepal sent teams up clean up the mountain, and all they did was push bodies off the side
And I believe they asked rob halls wife about his body, she said she'd rather they leave him where he was, that he died where he wanted fi be.

None of this makes sense:
Tor does nothing to help you, in what you describe; if your public keys become knowledge of those who want to track you, they can correlate the data just as easily - Its far more optimal to track wallets and transactions via the blockchain than it is to attempt to do so via IP addresses, which can change (either your ISP gives you a new one, you connect via a VPN or Tor).
Meanwhile, you have the added risk of corrupt exit nodes either feeding you false data or not relaying your transaction.
