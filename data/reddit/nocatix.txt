From what I gathered in the last couple of days (**am still a newbie so please correct me where I'm wrong**), never ever store BTC online or anywhere else where you don't own the private keys. Furthermore, never ever invest more than you're willing to lose, if you put in $30k it could be that you'll lose all $30k.
I ordered myself a Ledger Nano S ( but I have been reading that the Trezor ( is also a great hardware wallet.
As soon as you bought the BTC and if you're not trading them right away move them to your hardware wallet. I used coinbase for buying BTC before, but look at different coin exchanges for your country to see which one suits you the best.
Hope this helps!

I was in the same boat as you, couldn't find a reliable vendor in Canada. Even if I would've found one I probably wouldn't have bought from them, because I wouldn't trust a 3rd party with a hardware wallet that I'm going to use to store my BTC (who knows, maybe somebody could've tinkered with it. Especially with all the scams that are out there in the BTC market these days). So I went ahead and ordered directly from the manufacturer and paid international shipping (got the Ledger Nano S instead of Trezor, was looking at both but ultimately decided for the former).
