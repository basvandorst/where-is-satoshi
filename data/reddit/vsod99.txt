This idea that we should all hold bitcoin rather than actually using it is what's gonna kill this currency if anything. Stop discouraging using it what it's meant for.

Classic video.

Which I supplied him with. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:30:12
Hell yeah bois let's go! 
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:18:32
Valid point. Wasn't in the greatest mood this morning. Thanks for the response. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:03:00
Wow fuck off. Fucking resellers killing these deals for everyone else
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:58:59
Bitcoin cash more like Memecoin cash

It is, but BCH doesn't have the ability to activate SegWit so it will do nothing.

This is bitcoin's blockchain, not bth, so that explanation doesn't work.
That, and both coins have yet to have a difficulty change since the fork. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:17:25
No they are not linked. Your BCH will be fine if you spend your bitcoins, at this point. That's how a hard fork works - the two blockchains are separate now and your coins exist separately on both chains.
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:48:11
Yep I guess they want actual sales now
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:34:25
Fun times are upon us! 
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:37:24
Shit's crazy, yo
@_date: 2017-01-06 09:00:26
Exactly this. Bitcoin is still in its early years - I see it becoming much more stable when/if it gains mass adoption. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:10:53
This is easily the most interesting day of Bitcoin ever for me. Now we truly get to see if Bitcoin can scale the way we want it to. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:19:29
Yeah, you're right. I wasn't feeling too great earlier, nothing I can do about it now. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:59:58

Bring on the big buy orders! Let's break this psychological barrier. 
Can't stop staring at these charts. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:41:31
9999.99 was such a cock tease...
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:33:19
Dip? It just destroyed $10k.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:34:57
Personally I'm excited to see what happens to bitcoin once we hit this monumental milestone, and I imagine many feel the same. It's time to go to the moon!
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:29:52
Put in what you can afford to lose. Like any investment. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:01:22
Pretty sure a lot of us got screenshots of the moment, lol. 
@_date: 2016-09-16 00:10:40
You shouldn't be mining Bitcoin with GPUs anymore. Your power bill will cost you ~~10x~~ 10000x more than you'll ever make back in btc. It's too difficult these days.
