How often have you done a CC chargeback on an item you paid for intentionally?  For me the answer is never in 10 years and hundreds of thousands of dollars across tens of thousands of transactions.  And if it's a large sum of money to a business which may not be inclined to be nice for its reputation, there are always [multi-signature escrow services](

The patch is like one line.  The core devs don't need to be involved, the majority of the community just needs to upgrade their software.  If the consensus process for the current -core maintainers is flawed so severely, we'll see a fork soon.  Such is the nature of open source software - core devs are irrelevant in the long term, and the needs of the community determine action moving forward.

No, you were pedantically overanalyzing a common feature of idiomatic English.  Not sure what sectarian attitude you're referring to, whenever I address people who I share a context with I tend to refer to them as "we".  I write a lot of scientific publications and the use of the word "we" is very common and doesn't imply anything besides the fact that I am referring to a set of people which I am a member.  There are billions of such sets in which the context "we" would be appropriate.
Glad you realize you have a fresh attitude though.  Perhaps learn to consider alternative possibilities before running your mouth?  Language can be interpreted in pretty much any way you want, but I don't think anything in my comment implied I was using the word "we" in anything remotely resembling a sectarian way.  Curious, which [definition of sect]( you think I was operating under?
So yeah... "LoL".

*sigh*.  Saying something silly like all monopolies are caused by regulatory capture and deferring to the free market as self regulating is exactly the fetishization of the free market I'm talking about.
At the end of the day, the market is just a way to organize people.  Like the state, the church, the syndicate, whatever structure you want to choose, history has proven that regardless of your organizational structure a small group of empowered and controlling parties (in this case market entities with a lot more buying power than others) end up dominating and exploiting a large segment of the population.
I do believe this is inevitable with a pure free market.  I do believe pure free markets lead to the formation of monopolies and other fundamentally anticapitalist entities.  And it's not because I don't know what regulatory capture is.
As an example, read [the history of standard oil]( and note that they grew into an anticompetitive trust purely through market actions (in fact, regulation was often targeted at decreasing their profits or reducing the size of such large corporations).  Also, note that as America's market got less free (starting in the Progressive age and ending in around the early 70's), income inequality was reduced and overall standard of living much higher than during the more capitalist years of the early 1900's or after the beginnings of the deregulation movement in the 70's and 80's.  
This is just one of many examples of the possibility for anticompetitive action in a pure market structure (or the closest example we have ever had in history in a first world country).

I agree, I think the explanation is much simpler.  Bitcoin is tiny, Buffett doesn't invest in tech, and so he doesn't care.  Why would he?  He's going to keep making his dollars regardless of Bitcoin adoption, and that's his job.  He probably sees many aspects of Bitcoin as too ephemeral for an investment vehicle (after all, traditionally if Buffett invests in something there's someone somewhere he can point to or call up on the phone when things are going south and light a fire under), and he's right to say that its fundamentals are closer to that of an established penny stock than something blue chip.
He's from a different culture that doesn't really understand where Bitcoin enthusiasts are coming from.  The USD works for him, so why bother with decentralized/distributed/trustless money not controlled by a single party?
Either way his opinion is not really relevant to Bitcoin and has probably been way overdiscussed here.  If he made an argument about a technical or incentive issue that implied potential BTC performance that would be one thing, but he made an overly reductionist statement about how Bitcoin the payment network does not imply the value of Bitcoin the token, all while ignorning the reasons for the value of Bitcoin the token (trustless, decentralized, instantly transferable, impossible to counterfeit, digitally scarce, inclusive by design, etc).  So let's nod our heads and move on already.

Wow, you just unleashed a tirade of ignorance and oversimplifications so impressive that I only have time to address the most egregious of them.


When did I say a word about communism?  A single word?  **You can have social services in a non-communist state.**  Communism = workers owning the means of production.  Can you show me where I advocated for that please?  It seems to be a popular American libertarian viewpoint that any state structure advocating for social services is Communist, and that completely incorrect classification needs to end soon for the good of rational discourse everywhere.


This is again a super common American libertarian viewpoint that is antithetical to rational discourse and argumentation.  Social services = taking from the rich = business flounder = business leave.  This is completely incorrect.  There is tons of evidence out there that [business does best in an environment of low income inequality]( (and this is from S&amp;P, pretty much the most pro-business source you can find anywhere).  Despite our "oppressive government and social services", income inequality has been [increasing]( over the last 50 years (read the paper, it's mostly due to capital income and tax breaks for upper income brackets that this trend has been happening more in the United States than in Europe, Japan, or other countries worldwide).  Also, business has been [prospering like never before](  And what business are leaving America exactly?  Are you telling me that if we increase the capital gains tax by 5%, Apple and Pepsico will decide to go open up shop in Uganda because the taxes are lower?  Or that Joe Public will move to Mexico to start his business without oppressive government regulations?  Where exactly are business going (for non-tax haven purposes, I mean **actually moving their HQ and operations**) outside the US?  I question this premise, I question the conclusion, and I question the faulty logic that got you there because it seems to be completely divorced from reality.

Wrong.  It's a good conductor but that's only one of many aspects for most applications.  Gold wire is too fragile to be used in a lot of serious cabling.  


Neither is gold or the USD by that logic.  Neither have enough "intrinsic value" to support anywhere near current prices (you said it yourself... gold would be used *if it were much cheaper and more available*).  Bitcoin has been storing value just fine for years.


That would require everyone who's using a Bitcoin client to store value to act against their own financial interests.

The NAP is the most humungous crock of shit trick ever mentioned on the Bitcoin subreddit.  Not even libertarians can agree on its application to various issues, including [private property](  One man's aggression is another man's defense, and there will never be a universal consensus on hard guidelines on what does and does not constitute acceptable uses of violence (and indeed, imposing such guidelines on me would be a violation of the principle itself and would imply moral absolutism, in and of itself a flawed concept).  It's interesting as a tool to guide intellectual exercises on the morality of some things (like drug use, prostitution, etc) despite its overall moral inconsistency.  But try to apply it to an issue like abortion, property, social organization, etc and good luck.
The general public will always think these guys are crazy ranting about things like this, and it's not because their thinking is limited or they don't understand.  On the contrary, they are surprised by the naievete of those who claim the NAP as a gospel-grade philosophical framework for solving all of our social and organizational ills.

Oh, don't get me wrong I have no real regrets.  I love Bitcoin like a cultist and think it's the best payment system ever designed, and I will keep using it as such.  It's just that it takes a while for even technically savvy security professionals (like myself) to convince themselves that these ephemeral digital tokens are really a good store of value to complement the military/force-backed USD.  I expect more and more people to continue having that kind of revelation as the technology matures, because trusting even a small part of your life savings to something like BTC is not an easy leap to make.
Not to mention, I swept my own hotwallet from '11 and pulled out a few hundred bucks that I just had sitting around as change from previous transactions, so I got a nice bonus anyway :).  And since mid-2013 I've been living 80+% in BTC, which I find way more convenient than any legacy banking platform out there.

So you're saying some regulation of the marketplace *is* common sense.  I cannot start a business around raping, killing, etc.  Reread my post and then read yours; you make my argument for me.  You argue that some regulation is flawed and some beneficial, as I do.
Note that I don't fetishize the free market concept or think it's the apex of human organization - I think an unfettered free market is a fundamentally flawed concept.  A free market requires its participants to constantly be making rational and informed decisions, which is impossible if the channels for gathering information may be owned by entities with their own interests.  Also I believe economies of scale lead to monopolies by their very nature, which are at least as abusive as regulatory entities and accountable to the public in a much less direct way (if they provide a good/service for which the demand is relatively inelastic).  So, yes, some regulation is required.
I'm merely pointing out that most of society agrees with me on this and to dismiss everyone with this position as incapable of free thought or uneducated on the free market / libertarian concepts is the opposite of the logical argument that it purports to be.

Let's just tell all those kids born on the South Side of Chicago to single-parent families making $10k a year under the table (or maybe $20k at McDonalds if they're lucky and have a min wage job) to go to their churches and neighbors for food and help.
Clearly all those people on government welfare must be lazy, ignorant, or unable to provide for themselves, and if you were born into such a situation yourself you would easily be able to pull yourself up by the bootstraps and leave such a toxic environment behind with the help of your local neighbors and churches.  But God forbid any of that money comes from such byzantine and barbaric redistribution as "capital gains" tax, because you should need to work 8 hours a day every day scrubbing floors for a year to make $20k if you're poor, but if you're rich you have the right to make that money from your armchair in 2 seconds clicking a few buttons to shuffle your "investments" around while pretending you are creating wealth for society.

Yeah I definitely understand all the points you're making and I don't disagree that it's possible something like this could be relatively secure, but again for life changing amounts personally I would recommend going the extra mile.  If an attacker has the unlock info of your phone, they also have the hardware decryption key.  What would stop an attack that goes something like (backup app data) -&gt; (bruteforce PIN, restoring app data if too many incorrect guesses results in a wipe)?
Glad you're also looking into deterministic builds and verify the version posted in the app store, those are great steps for the average user (as you say you are targeting).  But this is r/Bitcoin and we all know that trusting a third party with closed source software (Apple) to manage the distribution/execution of BTC-related applications could inherently be a security flaw.  It all depends on your risk tolerance - I have a decently sizable ~5BTC in GreenAddress for example and wouldn't think twice about sacrificing the security of signing my transactions offline for the convenience it provides.  But when it comes to something like storing life savings, inheritance money, large scale wealth transfers, etc (things the BTC network should be designed to provide) I can always vouch for the tinfoil method.
@_date: 2014-08-19 15:03:43
What is trying to say is that your calculation should be.
Buy 5k at 1005 = 4.97512437811 BTC = 2412.94 USD @ 485.
Now let's say you do DCA over 9 periods (the same ones you gave in the OP).  This means, each period, you will put in (5000 / 9) = 555.56 USD, for a total investment of (again) $5000:
1/12/2013 - 555.56 USD @ 1005.00 = 0.55278606965 BTC
1/1/2014 - 555.56 USD @ 812.59 = 0.68367811565 BTC
1/2/2014 - 555.56 USD @ 954.00 = 0.5823375262 BTC
1/3/2014 - 555.56 USD @ 567.46 = 0.97901173651 BTC
1/4/2014 - 555.56 USD @ 478.98 = 1.15744406017 BTC
1/5/2014 - 555.56 USD @ 460.97 = 1.20517604182 BTC
1/6/2014 - 555.56 USD @ 630.99 = 0.88044184535 BTC
1/7/2014 - 555.56 USD @ 638.25 = 0.87042694868 BTC
1/8/2014 - 555.56 USD @ 597.84 = 0.9292620099 BTC
So your total BTC gain with DCA is 7.84, ~2.87 more than without for a loss that is $1391.95 smaller @ 485.  This is no surprise - if you're pricing BTC in USD, and the curve is downwards, sampling multiple times over the curve rather than at a higher point will decrease the average height (price) you buy at.  If BTC is going up then DCA is indeed not profitable, but it's intended as a hedge against losses, and if BTC is going up you have some net returns anyway regardless of DCA.

Big companies always change slow, it's called inertia and we should give it time.  What's their incentive to add Bitcoin when even if it were on that page it would probably be less than 1% of donations?  They don't care about advertising Bitcoin to people who don't already use it.
Just the fact that they take it shows they're ahead of other large companies on Bitcoin (duh, they're open web companies).  If you want to see them change vote with your wallet and donate BTC to an organization that has it on the main donation page.
I agree a little dropdown to replace that "Amazon" button with an "other payments" that shows a drop down list including BTC wouldn't be too hard on their part though, and I feel no less likely to succeed in generating donations than the current page.

The majority on this sub and bitcointalk kept recommending Gox as the best way to on-ramp USD right up until and even after withdrawls were disabled.  The only thing you can accuse new users of is being too trusting in not doing a full financial audit of MtGox before doing business with them, but even with today's exchanges (BitStamp, finex, OKCoin, Huobi, etc), it's hard for a consumer to audit them and easy for them to manipulate audits and proofs of solvency.  So even today the Bitcoin consumer has no recourse in the event of exchange failure.

I question your premise; in the United States, the ability of the government to initiate force has increased by any measure since the mid to late 1800's, but from the statistics it is clear that overall violence (even state violence in the form of war) has been doing nothing but decreasing since that time period.


I think this is a common flawed conclusion on r/Bitcoin that has little historical evidence to back it up.
I would argue that there are corrupt corporations (hell, this is r/Bitcoin: BFL, MtGox, NeoBee etc etc).  I would argue there are corrupt capitalist markets (yes, for reasons outside state incentives and regulatory capture, eg the tendency of the individualistic profit incentive of capitalism to minimize the consideration of distant externalities, eg the immoral use of child or slave/prisoner labor by virtually all US corporations in manufacturing due to its profitability and social acceptability).  I would argue there are corrupt religions (which are in no way monopolistic, though some may try to be).  I would argue that there have been corrupt feudal lords (again, no way monopolistic). 
The definition of corrupt I operate under is as follows:




So once again, plenty of corrupt and plenty of violent non monopolistic institutions in human history.  The rest of your comment is one possible narrative explaining why a state necessarily leads to an increase in violence, but I see no historical evidence for it (neither presented in your comment nor even alluded to) so I will ignore discussing such hypotheticals that are impossible to ground in objective reality.

Yes, because in the current financial system there is no way for regulators and law enforcement to see your transaction history or know who you are transacting with.  Also, there will be no way in the future to safely mix Bitcoins.

No, it was about spending dollars and receiving local fiat in another country (not necessarily the US), during which PayPal takes margin on the currency conversion.  So you're not receiving $4.48, you're receiving $4.48 of whatever fiat at their rate.  The rate is higher than you (or PayPal) would get on a forex exchange, so this has similar costs to discrepancies in USD/local BTC exchanges.
If you're talking USD to USD it's an entirely different distinction, PayPal will edge out BTC fees in this regard (though if you do something like Circle to Circle you can have instant no fee transactions with no spread or volatility exposure) *if you have a bank account and are willing to accept PayPal as a trusted third party*.  Plenty of people even in the US are either unbanked or don't want to do business with PayPal due to their shady dispute practices (google Fuck Paypal, or check r/paypal, etc).

Yup.  A Bitcoin wallet is a public/private key pair (PK, SK).  A Bitcoin address is just the hash of the PK.  To spend, you broadcast the public key associated with an address and "sign" (with the secret key) a message telling the Bitcoin where to go.  Anyone can validate the PK and check that you have the associated SK, and check that the hash of the PK (address) has a balance floating "in space" as you say, confirming that the transaction is valid.  Once it's in the blockchain you also can't spend those funds again, as they're no longer in space.
Addresses are not necessarily even associated with a single wallet.  But the probability there will be a collision is infinitesimally small.  
So basically yes, the money is always floating in space.  And you spend it by basically shouting "that piece is mine, send it there!" to the world.  Somehow, everyone agrees and says "yes, that's true, we'll write it in our books too".  Distributed consensus based on mathematics.  Where else is that true in the world?

So if the government is failing, and according to you government is failing implies business leaving, where are the business leaving?  Where?  I just don't think this is true.  And your argument that we will ask for 90% increases if we get 5 today is also ridiculous.  We already tax people at non-zero percentages.  By your argument, we would then be taxing people across the board at 90%.  [Slippery slope fallacy](
The US founding fathers also didn't advocate from freedom for taxation at all.  Their campaign was "no taxation without representation".  Do you think businesses pay a higher percentage of taxes than they get representation in the Government today?  Do you think the wealthy do?  The middle class?  The poor?  In my analysis, the answer seems to be "no, no, yes, yes" to those. 


Fine, but these are subjective terms.  One person's freedom is another person's bureaucracy.  To me, food stamps are freedom from starvation because my boss at the GMC manufacturing plant I've been working at for 20 years decides it's cheaper not to call me in for work tomorrow.  For you, it's a needless bureaucracy whose goal is to redistribute wealth in a "communist" way.   The problem with your arguments is that they look good on the surface, but they make hidden logical leaps that are often only evident if you closely analyze each step of your reasoning.  Everyone can agree that more freedom is good, but we can't agree about what freedom is.  To me, freedom means freedom from the need to go into debt to get an education, freedom from having to worry about putting food on my table if I lose my job, freedom from having to give 50% of my already low income to pay for basic services like health insurance that might, even if I have it, not fully cover me when I get sick, requiring me to declare bankruptcy and starve.  To you, this may mean bureaucracy.


I never said that, it was just an example.  Obviously we can't solve poverty only through taxation, but I linked you to a paper that postulated that the main cause of recent increases income inequality is a flawed taxation model that takes disproportionately from income as opposed to capital gains.  So arguing against fixing this system by tweaking the rates of capital gains and income tax, as the paper (and all other sources I have seen, as well as my own conclusions) suggests, seems to be counterproductive to me.
I'll leave you with one point.  Political ideologies are not a dichotomy; it's not the US constitution or communism.  I know you accused me of not understanding capitalism, but the reality is that I've seen the effects of both communism and capitalism.  While I was lucky enough to never live in a Soviet bloc country, the same is not true for any other member of my family that's older than me.  I've lived in a country where the impact and scars of communism were fresh everywhere you looked, and I've also spent much of my life in the United States.  I've read Marx, Engels, Smith, Friedman, Keynes, and many others.  All of these thinkers have valid points, but none of them are entirely correct and you shouldn't treat any of their works (or the works of a single person) as gospel.  While extremists on either side of the political and economic spectrums love to separate their dissent into groups and attack these groups and their ideology rather than the ideas of the individual that is speaking, reality is not so simple.  The groups are not so clearly defined, and even within a group there is such a huge diversity of ideology as to make attacks on group ideology irrelevant.  I think anyone who identifies as communist would find the idea of my being a communist laughable, and in fact I've been called a dirty capitalist many times before.  
And on the flipside I've been called a communist more times than I can count (mostly by my American Republican friends if I'm being honest here).  The reality is that as far as I see it there less difference between communist purist and market purists than they care to admit - both are systems for organizing a large number of people in an ad-hoc fashion without the need for a large centralized state.  Both promise prosperity for all, and while their tools and approaches are different (in communism the organization and production is motivated by the desire to advance the communal good of each actor, while in the market it is the "moral" action of a collection of rational self interested actors, therefore requiring money for account in the market and eliminating its need in communism), overall their message is the same: it is possible for humanity to self-organize into a society that offers prosperity to its active participants.  So the conclusion here is that "capitalists" and "communists" (these labels are really irrelevant but let's keep using them for the sake of argument) want the same thing and have a lot to learn from the strong points and shortcomings of each others' approaches (anybody who has seen something like the late 1800's US knows that our past implementations of pure capitalism have had problems not confined to past implementations of pure communism).  While I subscribe to neither ideology, I also find the dogmatic McCarthy-era style anti-Communist straw manning that goes on in US political debates not only entirely unproductive and anti-rational, but also laughable as somebody who knows enough about Communist ideology to know that people like Barack Obama represent the furthest thing from that.

You can feel free to use a web wallet or online bank or let someone else have custody of your private keys (or use multisig like GreenAddress) on Windows.  But if you're managing your own private keys, on fucking Windows, you're an idiot.  This is not a Bitcoin problem - it's a Windows problem.  
Windows is inherently insecure, it's closed to review, and it has new vulnerabilities found in it every fucking day.  The number of computers out there that are compromised running Windows are ten times higher than the ones running all other operating systems combined, including mobile.   For the average consumer, their Android or iOS device is always going to be a better bet for private key storage than Windows.
There are plenty of ways to use Bitcoin safely on Windows.  Storing your own private keys is not it, and it never ever ever will be.  This is not something any amount of software can fix, it requires education.  The same way storing your tax or SSN data or credit card in plaintext on Windows will get your identity stolen.  These are not hard concepts.  If you're going to use Windows, use a web wallet.

Agreed.  I'm a developer in the crypto space (though this is an alt so I'll never say of what), and I'm very scared.  Keep in mind that even if we do things by the book, a lot of us break minor laws every day and are extremely vulnerable to state scrutiny.  For example, I sell BTC for cash to a few acquiantances, which would be easy to construe as a money laundering conspiracy when taken together with my software.  I also have a propensity for smoking certain herbs that my jurisdiction takes issue with, which I'm sure could add a drug angle to the whole thing.
My point is if anyone is targetted and scrutinized under a microscope, then has the book thrown at them from every angle, they're in for a costly lengthy legal battle at the very least (and will be very easily taken out of commission).  We need to make clear what's legal and not with regards to software, and it's pretty simple as far as I see it: all software and network communications are speech and thought, and are protected by freedom of the above.

Any concrete plans to replace Factom's centralized data storage layer with a distributed, byzantine tolerant database?  Right now, it seems like using Factom in any sort of project requires the introduction of centralization.  While this may not be a problem for something that's inherently centralized (a government land registry), it's a major roadblock to Factom's use in other open source projects that might desire immutable records.
I've seen vague discussion about it on the project's Github, but I'm more interested in technical details.

tl;dr - Bitcoin sucks because you have to learn lots of "hard" things and there's no flashy marketing strategy to tell you what to think about it.
I use Linux and Bitcoin all the time (right now in fact).  Neither are hard to learn.  There are much much harder things to learn in this world.  If you expect your systems to operate without brainpower you will never be able to use them smartly.  If you think something that takes an afternoon or two to learn is for "hardcore nerds" you probably have bigger problems than BTC.

No.  21 is a "Bitcoin" company, Google is an Internet company, Exxon is an oil company, Apple is a computer company.  That doesn't mean their core values align with what is best for the resources they require.  It doesn't mean what 21 wants is best for Bitcoin, what Google wants is best for the Internet, or what Exxon wants is best for oil distribution.  The common theme here?  These companies want to *control* the resources to exploit them maximally for short term profits.  Their attempts to exert control are what we should be afraid of, because it's relatively clear that their interests will not align with the most utilitarian action in all cases.
Would 21 owning 60% of hashpower be good for Bitcoin?  Maybe they will do an internal study in 5 years and find that the answer is yes, because the network will have faster confirmations, more hashpower for security against other non-21 adversaries, more consumer confidence with mining based in the US instead of China, etc.  The point is they can spin whatever they are doing as good for you and good for Bitcoin, but what they will ultimately consider is what's good for themselves.  This is just a natural consequence of the corporate structure... corporations are single-purpose entities, their purposes being to maximize their own profit, not to secure some abstract ideals like free networks.  If at some future point they see more profit in decreasing the freedom of the network, they will, regardless of the blowback from some diehards.
Assuming their incentives are inherently aligned is naive.  They may be for the moment, but the more participants, investors, corporate structure, and red tape that is introduced, the farther these interests have the potential to diverge.  What if Jamie Dimon buys 60% of 21 after they achieve control of the network?  How long do you think Balaji's rhetoric will survive?


Yes, but this will not stop them from attempting to influence the network in ways that benefit them.  You are their audience right now, so of course you're getting what they want you to hear (exit, new system, cypherpunk, fuck the establishment, etc.)  But if 21 becomes the establishment and their average customer is then your mom or the guy on the street who thinks Bitcoin is a "drug currency", they will do what they think is best for themselves and their users, which may not be what's good for the founding ideals of the network as a whole.  For example, what if they get a bad image as creating untraceable money for drug dealers, and they start doing blockchain audits on the funds that are mined by their chips.  What if they then see a reasonable step as complying with the FBI's demands to share that data?  They are acting against the values of the network to subvert it, but still acting in their own self interest and (what they claim is) that of their users. 


That depends on your definition of hijacking.  I'd argue putting ad cookies all over the Internet to track and build profiles on users who think they are surfing with some level of anonymity, blocking Tor across all their services, requiring mobile numbers for "Google" accounts that are increasingly pervasive, data mining users with no clear disclosure, and offering services like Chrome which track users even across non-Google services (keyword complete, webstore, etc) are all subverting the core values of free networks and a free Internet.  Google doesn't see it that way, to them they are helping the Internet and offering useful services.
The same shit is going to happen with 21.  They are going to "help" Bitcoin by enforcing whatever they think is best for the network, towards their own self interest, regardless of the rhetoric of the founder.  He can be as "cypherpunk" as he wants, but when Goldman Sachs comes and tells the investors that they need to cut that rhetoric if they want a $1B partnership I can tell you some tunes are going to change right quick.  So if you want to build a new system, you should not have that effort spearheaded by a company who is part of the old system.  If that same company then pretends they are the new system, what they really are is the old system using clever marketing in disguise.  Anyone who really believes they are different has fallen for that marketing.
21 is VC funded, with VC's interested in a high value IPO that will get them a good ROI.  After that IPO, guess what 21 will effectively be?  A publicly traded finance company.  Publicly traded where?  On the NASDAQ and NYSE of course.  But what about exit, what about getting rid of these systems?  Sorry, have to play the game to get ahead.
It's a pattern on infinite repeat in history, and it means we should support the efforts of 21 and other Bitcoin companies, but stay extremely vigilant against any of them gaining enough influence over the network to be able to make decisions unilaterally (or in small cartels).
Silicon Valley (brilliant show) said it the best... we don't want those other people making the world a better place better than we do.

That should be just fine.  Just make sure your phrase doesn't get stolen or lost.  Also keep in mind that it's still vulnerable for as long as it's on the iPhone (so keep it on device for as little time as possible to minimize attack surface).  The major potential issues are a malicious action by Apple or one of its employees, a rootkit on your iPhone (it's happened before but I'd say statistically fairly rare), or some backdoor in the PRNG used to generate random numbers on the iPhone.  I don't think any of these exploits would be worth using on you and your tiny Bitcoin stash, when they could be targeting much bigger and more financially lucrative fish.

I think you're missing the argument here.  If Bitcoin replaces the current fiat system (and yes, that's a big and probably never going to happen "if" we'll gloss over here), the government will not be able to print *$9 trillion* to give in [zero-interest overnight emergency loans]( saving large institutions whose corruption and greed are the reason the world economy is fucked (let's be honest here, nothing has really changed negatively production wise since WWII, with the only difference being that the [bankers withdrew a bunch of money from the financial system]( making it unlivable for everyone else around the world).
If Bitcoin does not replace fiat, but instead grows in size from its current state, it will give people an alternative money which is immune to devaluation by such actions.  If people use the alternative, it will decrease the power of the current fiat system.  No need to jump to any extremes when there's a whole gradient of possibilities in the middle.  For example, if a third world country adopts Bitcoin in earnest, the power of the US government to exert their monetary influence and thus impose their will there will be decreased.  
If Bitcoin does not grow in size from its current state this is a moot point, since $2B of coin in circulation is nowhere near enough to make even the tiniest dent in the scale we're dealing with.

Another thing that's often forgotten is that developers can't exactly drop what they're doing and move full steam into other projects.  I've been dying to work on a Bitcoin project full time and move into the Bitcoin space since I first used it in summer of 2012, but I have a full time job, other development commitments, and other work to do.  I can't personally spend over 12 hours a day on development without going insane, and when 9.5 hours of that is a job and 2 are other projects you're already committed to, you can see the difficulty.
I've finally been able to clear time for some Bitcoin-related projects in the last six months, but it wasn't without a lot of effort and sacrifice.  I know a lot of devs in similar positions of wanting to create technology with Bitcoin who are stifled by real-world constraints.  All in all I think that kind of friction is natural and just means we'll be seeing more cool projects soon(er or later).

The guy above you jerking Balaji off and saying "oh sweet Balaji would never do anything to hurt Bitcoin, he's a visionary and have you seen his speech about exit?" bought the crap hook line and sinker.
The whole point of Bitcoin is open source, trustless money.  Open source, trustless.  If you're suddenly trusting Balaji more than you trust the CEO of Goldman, the experiment has failed.  He's just another person leading a corruptible corporation, and if they do succeed in taking over Bitcoin it will become more of the same old system in a shiny Silicon Valley wrapper (a la Square, PayPal).
Don't fall for it.  The real innovation is in open source, not more centralized corporations.
Edit: Just remember what people were saying in 2005 about Google and "do no evil", and how much everyone *loved* Google's motives as a company.

Paypal takes a big margin on currency conversion.  There are hidden fees.  With Bitcoin these are more visible, and I'm not sure there would be much of a difference in how large they are.  If it is it's only due to Bitcoin's relative immaturity, liquidity will bring arbitrage opportunities to the currency conversions and the implicit fee will be lower.

As an IT professional, OP should know this (hence why I gave him such a hard time).
If you're storing life changing amounts, spend twenty minutes doing some research.  I'm partial to (Trezor + password seed w/ multiple deniable wallets) + (Tails + Electrum).  With that combo, nobody is stealing your funds.  Paper wallets are also good if you're comfortably physically securing them (a la cash).  So is a 2-of-3 multisig account with you, a trusted family member, and an attorney (though there is less privacy here).  Or hell, if you don't care about privacy at all just use the Coinbase fucking vault with 2FA (that's not on the computer you log in from, hence the "2") and only log in when you need to. If you're at all security conscious there are many, many more flexible possibilities.
For small amounts, if your primary OS is Windows consider storing them on your phone instead.  iOS is actually a very good platform for BItcoin storage when used properly, and Android is good if you're careful about the applications you install and use a wallet that encrypts its local data.
What you definitely should not do is decide to store $5k on your computer and Google "bitcoin wallet", download the first one you find, and assume it's secure.
I get a little bit sick of this whole "omg security is so hard I'm just an average person I'll never understand it" mentality.  You have to take responsibility over your computing in the 21st century, when it's so critically important to every aspect of your life.  This responsibility includes basic security research and education.  You don't have to be an expert to take basic precautions.
Disclaimer: I am a security expert, so maybe I'm just salty seeing people make the same stupid mistakes over and over again when the solution should be common knowledge by this point.

Yeah, it would.  It would have happened with cash.  Not sure how you missed that example in my original post?  If you want to be your own bank, be your own fucking bank.  Leaving 25BTC on a single sig Windows wallet is just not it.  That's like leaving $5k under your neighbor's mattress, and then whining that cash is not ready for the masses.  It's not thousands of pages, it's just common sense: never use closed source unaudited insecure software anywhere in your storage stack.  How is this hard?
Otherwise, you can always use services like Coinbase or Circle, which echo the traditional custodial model of fund ownership (exactly like the legacy system), or use services like GreenAddress that do 2FA multisig and let you stay in control of your own keys (impossible in the legacy system), or a hardware device like the Trezor which stores all private information (impossible in the legacy system), and stack all the trojans you want on your operating system.

You have absolutely zero recourse if the receiver withdraws the money from PayPal and spends it, no matter how hard you whine.  And PayPal provides little recourse in general if you're doing a personal transfer.  The exception is of course eBay items.
Same deal for a SWIFT transfer.  Good luck getting any recourse there (this is how I paid my rent when I lived abroad, and the standard for doing so, with transactions irreverisble once cleared.  Fees were around 5% after the currency conversion margin they took in the spread).  As for record, a blockchain transaction from your Coinbase account with the receiver mentioning their address in an email is just as good in terms of legal process as a PayPal transaction.
Of course with BTC you can do a multisig escrow and (eventually) smart contracts that render all this moot.  is one such platform.
But everyone on this sub already knows this (having had these discussions years ago hundreds of times with people much more creative than yourself), hence why it's not really "religious".

And the point I'm making is that any corporate figurehead purporting to be acting in the interests of everyone rather than the interests of the corporation is simply exercising marketing.  Their worldview is irrelevant.  A corporation can claim to be "working towards mass adoption of Bitcoin for all developers and participants", or "changing the world", or "providing exit from our political sytem", or "providing a new paradigm to do [x] that's fundamentally different from the old one".  In the past, these claims have universally turned out to be marketing bullshit, and Silicon Valley the key peddlers.  Square is a great example ([shit like this]( in payments, [Apple]( really pinoeered the trend in the 80's, and Google modernized it for the '00's with the "do no evil" motto.  All of the companies that used this sort of "anti-system/establishment" advertising technique ended up becoming the establishments they sought to replace as they looked to maximize their own profit (inherent function of a corporation), with no differences save the shiny front end thrown on.  In other terms, meet the new king, same as the old one.
So you should be skeptical of everything any corporation does/says/puts out and all of the control they inevitably try to exert, regardless of the worldview of the founder.  Not give the corporation a free pass because you trust the founder to be altruistic (or even rational... you cannot pretend to understand the incentives of someone running a $200B company, its investors, or the operators behind the scenes like the BoD), as the top level commenter does.  See this:




I could rewrite the post for 2005 as follows:




Corporations will act in their own interest, not yours, not the network's.  Every time.  Their own.  These interests are not necesarily aligned, so let's not pretend they are, and let's be skeptical of any plans regarding the mining network financed by the types of investors 21 has (who ultimately have control and influence over every aspect of the company).

Patently false.  E-mail was expensive as hell at first and required tying up your phone line for what amounted to a text-based BBS service (or having a dedicated line if you communicated a lot).  Internet service was expensive before low-barrier to entry services like AOL, and restricted to mainly academics and technical workers.  It wasn't immediately obvious to anyone why e-mail was better than SMS or similar services, or the age-old phone system that everyone had anyway that could be used for instant communication.  Remember that even telegraphs had a market until recently.
While people understood the theoretical benefits, many people were unsure of how e-mail fit into their lives (look up any clips on the Internet from the early 90's and that will be clear... plenty of clips of people going "yeah those networks and the nerds that use them, I'll never have or understand them or 'surf the web cyberspace' haha").

Depends on what you mean by "food", because you're talking about hundreds of commodities here.  If you mean corn only a very small subset of species on earth value it.  Likewise for barley.  Likewise for rotting bodies, which are food for plenty of organisms.  Etc etc.  No matter what you choose, it will not be useful to every species on Earth.  None of that matters to us though, because as I said, value is a social construct.  Look at the dictionary definition of value:  and notice how each definition relies on the presence of humans.


Importance to who?  Oh yeah, a human.


Worth to who?  In trade with who?  Commerce with who?


Exchanged by who?

Such a scheme would only work with two participants.  Yes, there is some natural statistical variance in finding blocks and some lag with difficulty adjustments, but when you have a network with dozens (or hundreds) of participants, it becomes extremely difficult to model or time changes in a way that is profitable.  This is especially true if others are doing the same.
What I take issue with is this:




The expected time for you to find a block does change.  You just have to wait until the difficulty adjustment.  If it increases your probability of finding a block, this means your expected time must decrease (since the E[X] = 1/p for just you, where *p* is the probability of you finding a block and is equal to ( your hashing capacity in blocks per second ) * ( difficulty / 2^32 )).  Yes, there is a bit of lag for the difficulty adjustments, but less competitors in the network over time = you find blocks faster over time.
A would also solve more blocks in your scenario by mining with B every week for 5 weeks.  In this case, A would solve 2.5*1008=2520 blocks instead of 1008.  While A will have to pay more in electricity, as long as A can mine with reasonable profitability this is not an issue.  Any extra profit gained by dropping out to lower the difficulty then rejoining the network is destroyed by the loss of these 1512 extra blocks and the depreciation of the hardware, which is just sitting there.
Not to mention any sort of selfish attack like this would require large amounts of hashpower which could be leveraged in other ways to greater profitability.
So cute attack in theory and a natural part of adjusting difficulty on any interval that is not "every block" (though the latter comes with its own much more serious issues), but I'm not seeing the practicality here.  If you can only influence 5-10% of network hash power, it's not going to be very effective, and it will almost certainly be more profitable for you to keep your miner on during every difficulty adjustment period.  If you have closer to 50% of the network hash rate, there are better ways to leverage that for profit than intentionally manipulating the difficulty.

That makes less than no sense.  By that logic nothing has inherent value to the universe as it will all decay to entropy eventually and be useless as nothing is left.

I'll assume you're implying a market-based solution, because that's what most readers on r/Bitcoin seem to tout as a go-to.  If this assumption is wrong feel free to correct me.  Many people believe the free market doesn't lead to optimal outcomes based on historical (and present-day) evidence.  You mentioned healthcare so I will use it as an example, but this argument applies to the existence of profit incentives in all the systems you mentioned due to fundamental contradictions between profitability and the services provided.
While having healthcare not controlled by a single group of people is indeed a rationally noble goal, until we see a system presented able to do so it's merely a pipe dream.  The free market is not a one-size-fits-all solution to these problems.  For example, I strongly disagree with for-profit health insurance.  And I do not believe the market is an efficient or effective way to realize not-for-profit health insurance in the absence of regulation or external intervention.
If someone creates a fair system for not-for-profit health insurance where payouts are demonstrably need-based and pay-ins are equal for all, I would support such a system.  I do not believe the market is capable of creating one due to the fact that it is more profitable/"rational" to let someone die than not if you expect them to cost more than they input. Not to mention that it is profitable to use insurance pools to speculate, as health insurance companies like Aetna and United currently do (in billions of real-estate, stock and bond investments, etc.)  And thus our only shot at such a system is currently having a public option.  Note that this still doesn't mean healthcare is controlled by the government, merely that the government is a participant in the ecosystem, competing and integrating with private industry to provide a service that corrects a market failure.  This is contrary to money, where one government group that is not even fully accountable to any elected government (the Federal Reserve) wholly owns and decides all monetary policy for the entire world.
Bitcoin on the other hand is the world's first not-for-profit monetary system - while its participants profit according to their participation, this profit is entirely transparent and accountable.  There is no central controlling entity able to make decisions for the entirety of the Bitcoin network drawing a profit, and the core development of the protocol  proceeds according to the wishes of the majority of its stakeholders democratically (through updates).  Miners profit not *because they control the Bitcoin network* but *because they provide services to the Bitcoin network's users*.    When such a system is presented approaching the challenges of healthcare, I will support it wholeheartedly.  As will I support participation of elected governments (local or otherwise) in all of these systems, Bitcoin included.

Humans didn't have the technology to refine it.  Today we can make fuels, plastic, waxes, asphalt, and [many other products]( using crude as a base.  Chances are most consumer products you buy in industrialized economies these days have components derived from crude, and all of them relied on crude in shipping/transport.  If crude oil doesn't have "inherent value" to our species, there's nothing that really does.  Think about it this way: if I gave you a thousand barrels of oil worth $0, would you use it?  If I gave you 1000 Bitcoins worth $0, would you use them?  1000 US dollars?  Bars of gold?  etc.
Crude definitely has way more "inherent value" (not really a fan of that term in general, because inherent to  what?) than pretty much any other commodity today.  I think what you're getting at with "use value" is that utility is a better term overall, but I would definitely argue that when you talk about inherent value of a commodity you're talking about its utility.

Hi Mike.  Just wanted to let you know I will be legally publishing open patches on Github together with instructions on how to build the Trezor firmware on third-party devices.  Manufacturers can easily do the same and ship a script that does this for the user, thereby not directly redistributing the firmware.  Or the shady ones will ignore all IP anyway and just manufacture exact indistinguishable Trezor clones using this code, branding signing keys and all, with Trezor firmware preinstalled.  This happens all over the world with a variety of products, and Trezor is not exempt.
This approach hurts only legitimate developers and users and has no place in an open hardware development cycle.  Trezor is sneakily moving from an open to a closed development model, and that's really sad for the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.  Hopefully Ledger Wallet sees this as an opportunity to open their entire stack, or somebody else does, because until that point I'll have to stick with the knock offs.

Have you even been reading my posts?  I've already broke it down pretty clearly using your first example.  Let's consider only 2-party. In your own example the stable pattern is:






So, in 5 weeks, A solves 1008 blocks.
If A and B are on the other hand *both mining* for 5 weeks (the same period as above), there will be (2.5 * 2016 =  5040) total blocks mined.  A will mine half of these, or (5040/2 = 2520) blocks.  2520 &gt; 1008 * 2 = 2016.  
So when you say 


that is incorrect.  You are mining for 1/5 of the time for (1008/2520) = 1/2.5 the blocks (and therefore reward).  Since you are mining for 1/5 the time, your savings are 80% on electricity.  So **ignoring depreciation**, if extra revenue = (the number of blocks you miss out on = 1.5/2.5 = (3/5)) * (block reward revenue for the stable period) &gt; (80% of electricity costs for the stable period) = savings by giving up extra revenue, this approach is unprofitable.  And this is with 2 parties perfectly timing and assuming ideal uniform block distribution, so best case scenario.  If you post another refutation I'd like it to be a mistake in my math rather than a handwavy dismissal :) (I think I've put enough effort into your ideas to warrant that).


Electricity will only ever be the dominant cost when Moore's law breaks down.  Electricity costs will decrease with new generations of energy efficient chips, and hashrate will increase.  This has been the general trend in all of computing thusfar.


Right, until one of them decided to secretly leave their miners on to take advantage of the generally reduced difficulty while mining full time.  Collusion is a problem in any industry, but in Bitcoin the only thing it can really affect is the overall hashpower of the network.  Once miners start attacking confirmation times, which was what A was doing in your original scenario, they are losing *more opportunity cost* by having to keep their miners shut off for longer periods (if a difficulty adjustment period takes 4 weeks rather than 2, that's 4 weeks of downtime for every week actually mined of capital just sitting there being unproductive).  It is in the miners' self interest to preserve confirmation times, and while they can collude to save energy, this is not necessarily a bad thing as long as the overall network hashpower stays high (which it will, I had confidence even in the days of hobbyist GPU miners and we're a long way from there and likely always will be unless Bitcoin as an experiment fails).
@_date: 2015-01-29 07:39:09

What kind of open source standard can't be freely used, modified, or redistributed??  I guess they're technically correct, but this is hugely disingenuous and misleading.  If they are no longer committed to open source they should drop that portion of the $119 fee to buy a Trezor.

The less you control, the less significant that difference.  At some point, other sources of variance in finding blocks overwhelm the effect and render it insignificant.  My guess is this point is well before 1/5 of hashing power, at which point your profitability would only increase marginally from this scheme while overall profit would decrease significantly for the weeks you produce nothing (in your 2-party example, A would have to keep his miner shut down 4 of every 5 weeks, mine less than half as many blocks overall, and save only 80% of electricity cost... it already looks almost unprofitable even with two competitors, unless the price per Bitcoin is so low mining would otherwise be unprofitable).  Overall I still assert that it would be more profitable overall to just keep the miner on and mine blocks than to turn it off and let it depreciate to slightly increase profit margins when you are mining.
It looks like mathematically the attack is profitable, if you can time it perfectly and expect ideal block distribution, when the revenue from the extra blocks mined by keeping the miners on (1512/2520) * (number of blocks mined in time period) &lt; (80% of electricity costs for continuous mining in time period).  And this is with two parties.  With more that first fraction would be higher, and the 80% number would be lower.  I'd come up with a general formula but I can't be arsed :).
Disclaimer: I'm high, don't trust my math.  Pretty confident on the general sentiment though.

Yeah, Chinese companies will take that reference licensed code and produce an exact copy, casing and all, with an identical "Trezor" logo and branding materials on it in due time.  And it will be legal for them to do in China. Nothing you can do, including closing development entirely, would stop this.  B-Wallet was actually being classy for a knock-off by posting their modifications as per the license and building a product that clearly looks like an knock-off.  Big companies on the other hand will just develop their own equivalent, since it's not a hugely complex product and they don't want to be seen as clones anyway.  So this protects Trezor financially from nobody.

Hence my concern.  I think being "informed" in free market transactions is an assumption but also an impossibility.  It's very hard to inform yourself in a climate where all those who are powerful have an incentive to get you to believe something entirely false (keeping you misinformed and thus asserting their power over your decisions).
In a world full of conmen, the due diligence required to make informed decisions on even the most basic of transactions becomes rapidly prohibitive to the point of impracticability.  This is before we even consider the monumental number of disagreements humans will have on what the truth actually *is*.  Getting accurate information in such a quagmire would be difficult for even those most experienced with a field.

To an extent I agree with each of these points, but for me personally the important thing is that they reverted the license.  While my trust in them is definitely marred by this event, it doesn't really matter because I didn't trust them at all in the first place.  So I will buy a Trezor and continue to recommend them as long as their licenses are in the right place, but I think both I and the entire community should be extremely vigilant on future updates and changes.  Which should be the case anyway.
So yes, SatoshiLabs and their staff/manufacturing pipeline/software should not be trusted.  But as long as you can use, modify, and redistribute their code, that's par for the course for any such manufacturer.
I also feel that we should be relatively tolerant with mistakes made by such companies in a new space - open hardware development is a very new model and concept, and it's not an easy model to get right.  If the Trezor guys stay committed to it though they will be definitively better than any closed competition, and more accountable to the community at large.

How can you have a dev in this thread saying something like (from OP)


and then use a license that clearly isn't open source?  How can you develop an open standard without giving redistribution rights?  This is misleading at best and shady at worst.  This is a change that hurts legitimate users and developers by removing their freedoms to modify and build on the software they run, while doing nothing to stop Chinese vendors from shipping devices with impunity (they can give instructions on how to flash official Trezor firmware, or even better just do it themselves since they tend to ignore IP laws anyway, especially software licenses on published code which rarely apply in practice in China).  Shame on you guys, and a sad fact that this is the best we can do as an "open" hardware project in the Bitcoin ecosystem.  I'm going with the clones from now on- at least I can fork their repos.
I was on the fence between B-Wallet and Trezor, leaning strongly Trezor after seeing the info in this original post.  The tracking supercookie is quite extreme, and the wiring changes make little to no sense.  Prominently playing up the fact that you're the original and have many shitty Chinese knock-offs that are shitty because of security reasons (which is the reason people buy this device anyway) should be more than enough to put you far above the competition. That being said, Trezor has lost my business and recommendation pending the reversal of the MS-RSL license.  I just ordered my B-Wallet and will be building my own firmware, creating a patch from the changes I consider essential in the B-Wallet / Trezor diff and maintaining it across Trezor firmware updates (because you can't stop me from doing that as a developer as per the reference license), using my own entropy in addition to what's hardware-generated.  I will provide open instructions on how to do all these for any users wishing to use the Trezor firmware themselves on generic devices, as well as patches working on the latest versions of Trezor firmware so minimal effort is required for new users.
Thanks for letting me know about Mycelium by the way.  I never really used it, but uninstalled from my Android phone anyway.  Closed development has no place in open hardware or the Bitcoin ecosystem as far as it pertains to me.
Of course, it's not my project and the Trezor team is free to do as they choose.  But as a consumer I recommend considering whether this is the kind of license you support, and who these changes are really hurting/affecting.
**Edit**: If you reverse the license and commit strongly to open development principles, I will be in for a shiny new Trezor with screenshots+blockchain for proof.  It goes both ways :).

Wouldn't be too hard for a manufacturer to do it all with a big button that says "Flash Software to Device".  Tell people they need to go through an installer on their computer before the device can be used.  Standard protocol.
I have a job where I need to make things easy to use, so in my free time I'll cater to users who are comfortable with text-based interfaces.  Literally the process would be Boot a VM -&gt; Terminal pops up -&gt; Press enter -&gt; Wait as things happen in background -&gt; Firmware image generated.  Plenty of users would do that to save $60 I'd imagine, especially if Trezor doesn't have the openness as a competitive advantage.
Of course there's no real incentive for me to actually do this unless I have to buy a B-Wallet and maintain a patch for my own personal use *anyway*, generally I hate knock-offs.  But the one group of people Trezor really shouldn't be pissing off is developers, the group mainly affected by this license change.
PS - If a big company wanted to compete in this space they could and would almost certainly prefer to come up with something far superior to Trezor hardware and software wise with minimal effort, as it's not a complex product and large companies generally don't build clones.  So this doesn't protect Trezor from them either, at all.

Any good business knows this and wouldn't alienate any portion of their customer base unless it was required to secure the business of a larger number of people.

Multisig definitely improves things.  


Agreed, if you define "secure element" as sandboxed execution environment.  But the open hardware/software combos out there are more secure than any closed execution environment anyway.  
It's not that I don't respect the approach, it's that I feel like it's too soon, and assuming security benefits from a closed platform is practically impossible.  The Trezor approach with its open STM32-based hardware and auditable firmware are currently closer to a secure solution than anything running on a secure element.
I definitely support the effort to make something harder to attack than vanilla Android applications on the hardware of most end-users currently running Android wallets, and I think you guys are doing great work there.  I just don't think it's as good as a hardware wallet at this point, and I don't want to mislead people into doing something like skipping a Trezor to use this solution.
@_date: 2015-08-26 17:01:20
A lot of people also don't understand how A/B tests actually work.  They test a particular *implementation* of a feature, not the validity of a feature itself.
When you A/B test Bitcoin, you're really testing your payment UI, not the validity of Bitcoin itself.  There are certainly payment UIs where adding Bitcoin will increase contributions, and others where it will decrease contributions (same as any other payment method from Skrill to eGold to PayPal).  A/B tests are very complex, and a single test is meaningless... you need to test hundreds of possible implementations before you can draw a general conclusion about the functionality rather than the UX.
AFAIK only two implementations have been A/B tested, which is far too small of a sample size to draw any conclusions.  Part of the scientific method is repetition and repeatability, so in that sense the tests are not very scientific (you generally don't draw any conclusions after hypothesis tests on two relatively small datasets).

I'm aware.  So again, comparing TrustZone to AOSP in terms of security depends on comparing the implementation of the requisite specifications for TrustZone with the underlying OS code (AOSP).  Sorry if that was unclear.


Yes, this is what I am talking about.  Network access disabled is not even necessarily a requirement, you can also restrict installed apps to only the core system services and the open Bitcoin wallet you're using to achieve similar levels of security.  Like hardware wallets, this would require a dedicated device.  I believe that would be at least as secure as the Trustlet solution, and moreso due to its ability to be audited.


From the title: "Ledger Trustlet (**a Bitcoin hardware wallet you can download**) available in beta"
Just pointing out the differences in security.  Because with that kind of marketing, tons of people will ask "why would I pay $119 for a Trezor when I can get the same security benefits for free?" while assuming the two solutions have similar attack surfaces.  In reality, the Trustlet solution has little in common with a dedicated hardware wallet in terms of attack surface.


Not with TrustZone.  That article also has not convinced me that remote attestation can solve doublespend.  Any wallet that allows you to import a key, even with attestation, is vulnerable to double spend (import key on one attested wallet and double spend with one that isn't).  Not only that, but you're trusting the manufacturer with remote attestation, so such attestation can never be strictly required for Bitcoin transactions as it's antithetical to the core design principle of a lack of requirement of trusted third parties.

Yes, you would have to exhaustively check all possible clock and voltage attacks.  Perhaps the hardware is resilient to simple attacks but vulnerable to an attack with more complex and specific parameters known only to state agencies and other actors with significant resources.  There is no way to audit this, whereas with the full specification you can reason about why the *design* is resilient to attacks, reducing the auditing requirements to verifying the implementation of the design rather than brute forcing possible attacks and seeing what comes back.  You cannot scrutinize a closed design.


The STM32 is not a particular microcontroller, it's a family.  Obviously security depends on implementation details.  There is no reason that STM32 cannot inherently be hard against these types of attacks you mention (tamper resistance, clock/voltage glitching, timing and power analysis, etc.)


Just because no vulnerabilities have been found does not mean none exist.  A history of resilience against reverse engineering means jack when it comes to drawing conclusions on the security of a platform, which depends more on the process by which the system is designed.  This process cannot be audited unless it is open.


But this is exactly what the OP of this thread did earlier!  They claimed that Trustlet is *more secure* than an Android wallet.  I'm now claiming it's possible to have an Android wallet that's *more secure* than Trustlet and you're calling it a false comparison?  I don't really follow.  Obviously the attack surfaces are not directly comparable, but the two can certainly be compared in terms of the financial difficulty and statistical probability of success of a private key recovery attack.


Again, this is about the process as much as the code.  You have trust that whoever implemented your chip has followed the appropriate hardening process in their implementation, and you would have to reverse engineer a chip specifically designed to be resilient to this (the TPM/secure computing chips).  Much harder than verifying a simple open design you already have the full hardware specifications for.  And you would have to do the reverse engineering from scratch on each diff, because it won't be clear how changes correspond to your idea of the system or affect components as a whole.


What it didn't convince me of is that such hardware is immune to attacks by highly motivated state actors.  If such an actor does have an exploit for the particular execution environment we're discussing, do you expect me to be able to find it through reverse engineering with no source available?  Anyone familiar with that kind of reverse engineering knows that such subtle exploits can be for all intents and purposes impossible to reverse engineer.  I place 0 stock in the fact that nobody has found an exploit implying that one does not exist.  In fact, [the past has shown us]( that such exploits do exist in solutions previously thought to be secure.  At least with OSS you can verify the process by which the code is developed yourself and draw your own conclusions on the claimed assurances.


Perhaps I feel ideologically differently than you do.  It's my belief that open source *is* inherently a more secure development model (easier to verify security claims with no third party trust required).  Would you use, for example, a closed source desktop Bitcoin wallet over an open one?  Would you generate your paper wallets on Windows instead of Linux?  Why not, when you can check that it's secure with a few weeks in IDA Pro and some hardware RNG tests?  I therefore personally believe that it's the users' job to demand their rights to understand the development process, system design, and system source in pursuit of performing their own audits.
That is not to say that there is not a history of security vulnerabilities in OSS, simply that OSS gives users far more power in verifying security guarantees.  This is pretty much indisputable.
@_date: 2015-08-26 18:42:19
I still assert that I can find a security hole allowing for doublespend in any scheme that allows you to manage your private keys with a wallet supporting remote attestation that doesn't require trusting a third party outside of the attestation scheme.
I would be interested for you to present the full details of your scheme, so I can attempt to do this.  I think we are both in agreement that not letting the user have access to some sort of private key management that's capable of restoration on an independent device is a non-starter though, due to the issues with losing your device (I should know, I just lost my Trezor with $20k on it a few weeks ago.  Luckily I had many backups).
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:21:20
It makes little difference to miners, the only thing affected is propagation time.  Mining itself proceeds on the block headers only, so the ASICs never see anything but the headers anyway (of course miners also have to run a node somewhere but this is a trivial percentage of their expense).  Block size makes 0 difference to the discovery process outside of the potentially increased bandwidth/latency requirements that if not met could lead to a higher orphan rate.
@_date: 2015-08-28 01:04:19
If there is any method to derive S2 or any group of people know it (incl. the manufacturer), the devices are vulnerable to doublespend.  This is essentially the same as trusting a third party, where the third party is everyone who knows S2.  Multisig with that party's secret is equivalently useful (where the secret is similarly programmed into trusted devices which don't attest the same way it would be in those that do).
You've reduced the problem to "trust everyone who knows a secret not to doublespend", which can be more easily accomplished with multisig than with attestation.
My claim remains:

No, I'm not.  You just completely misinterpreted my comment.  There are 100 different ways to add a Bitcoin option to the same UI.  You can use a button, drop down, other payments link, separate page, QR code, address, higher on the page, lower on the page, smaller font, bigger font, etc etc.  Testing one of these and arguing Bitcoin decreases conversion is retarded, you need to test them all.  Otherwise your only conclusion is that the way you placed that button decreases conversion, not Bitcoin.  This could be because of the more choices less action idiom known in UX.  Drawing conclusions that it's because of Bitcoin's reputation or something like this is a clear misinterpretation of the results and the nature of AB tests you claim to understand.
Let's take a page where you have four buttons for payment, and you add Bitcoin as a fifth button in an A/B tests.  Conversion decreases 20% in your 6 months of gathering a large dataset.  Consider the following possible conclusions:
- Adding Bitcoin as a payment option decreases conversion by 20%, regardless of how it is added
- Adding Bitcoin as a button decreases conversion by 20%, while adding it as a QR code increases conversion by 15%
- Adding a fifth button to a four button payment site decreases conversion by 20%, regardless of the payment method on the button
- Increasing the width of the payment area from 500px to 750px (required for 5 buttons) decreases conversion by 20%
How can you tell which is true with a single A/B test?  Or if some combination of these is true?  etc.  You cannot.  Thus, you need a large number (series) of A/B tests to draw meaningful conclusions.  This is a well known fact among anyone who actually uses A/B tests for decision making.  You never run just one, and you constantly refine and iterate based on past results.

I literally addressed this above.... please read:


It is possible with an open stack.  If you are not using a proprietary compiler, you can use the above method (replace "machine code" with STM32 binary).


I wouldn't say either is more or less secure.  It depends on the ease of audit, the availability of technical specifications and supporting materials (like code, schematics, and analysis results), and the implementation itself.  Either STM32 microcode and the hardware that runs it or the trusted chips can be tampered with similarly, especially if they are not auditable.


That entirely depends on the implantation of the "TrustZone" and the "underlying OS".  I may sound like a broken record here, but the full implementation details of TrustZone are not public, thus it cannot be meaningfully compared.  I would argue that AOSP compiled from source (and if you're really paranoid, with network access disabled) is thus more secure than any TrustZone currently.


I do a lot of work with STM32 (and other) microcontrollers in industrial processes, aerospace, and automotive.  I'd say it's about 30% of my job.  Otherwise I try to avoid embedded because the amount of proprietary closed software (from compilers to the software running on the controllers itself) makes it difficult to do my job.  Did you know it's standard practice in these industries to reverse engineer the machine code when switching architectures to port the software?  That's what you get with proprietary software, and it won't ever be secure.
As for the smiley, just trying to lighten up a heavy conversation.  I apologize for the strong language, but it bothers me to see proprietary software being peddled using the word "secure" when in fact such software takes away from the user their ability to audit and verify any security claims made by the vendor.

That's not what I'm talking about, see my reply [here](  Please try to understand my comment before replying.


You don't test them all against each other, you test multiple variations of a single base.

Even if you need to trust someone, it's about having a choice on who you trust.  If you have to trust a certain group of people to use a solution, you lose control over that decision. 


You misinterpreted my argument.  Open source is not secure by default.  Closed source is insecure by default.  Why?  Because *any* security claims you make about closed source software are impossible to audit without trusting the person making those claims (the vendor).  With open source, these security claims are verifiable without the requirement of trusting the vendor.
@_date: 2015-08-25 14:34:45
Repeat after me There is no such thing as secure and public proprietary software.  If you cannot read the code that's running on your machine, the software is effectively compromised.  It could contain any number of backdoors that would be undetectable in practice.  Do not trust large amounts of coins with such an implementation.  Use a wallet that has both open software and hardware, and is thus fully auditable.  
Any wallet claiming to be secure on a closed platform is effectively compromised.  Any team claiming a wallet on a closed platform is secure is either incompetent or effectively compromised.

I don't know about you, but I run my own personal SMTP server.  Maybe people don't, but what people do is really irrelevant.  The same way most people are going to be running Electrum and doing SPV, but they'll still be using Bitcoin and it'll still be a peer to peer system (incidentally I also run my own Bitcoin node and private Electrum server).
You can generally delegate trust to a node in any peer to peer system and use it as a trusted client-server model.  Bittorrent has seedboxes, SMTP has IMAP, etc.  What makes it peer to peer is that you have the choice not to.
@_date: 2015-08-27 02:47:49
My argument is pretty simple, and it implies that no such scheme exists (no matter how smart the person creating it, with the current opcodes in Bitcoin it remains an impossibility).
Consider an attested recovery procedure that recovers your private key PK from a recovery information known to the user, called R.  To not use any trusted third parties, there must be a process to get from R to PK (recover the device).  If a user knows R, they can restore PK on a non-attested device by this same process.  Then, they've created a non-attested wallet with the same secret as the attested wallet.  This situation is vulnerable to double spend as mentioned above.
You can solve this with some trusted third party doing remote attestation, but at that point you may as well be using multisig.
Would be interested to hear if I have any misconceptions there.

In that case if you lose the device you are fucked.
Any key recovery or derivation procedure that doesn't require the device would introduce a security hole by being able to create two devices with the same private key, one of which is attested.
And this is only one of *many* issues with BTC wallets that hide private keys from users.
@_date: 2015-08-26 20:18:33
Yes, that is the general iteration strategy.  My point was simple: it is impossible to draw a conclusion on *why* conversion decreased from 2 A/B tests.  It is even more impossible to draw a stronger conclusion on whether or why Bitcoin decreases conversion from these tests.  Thousands of such tests are the standard for drawing similar conclusions.  The only conclusion that can be drawn from one A/B test is that A was better than B or vice versa, not *why*.  Why requires further analysis that is currently lacking for Bitcoin as a payment option.
Again, if you have any experience with A/B tests this is all quite obvious to you.  After a failed test on something like adding Bitcoin, the way forward is not to conclude that Bitcoin decreases conversions but rather to try alternate placements of the Bitcoin payment on the page to see whether each decreases conversion and by how much.  If you can conclude that all configurations including a Bitcoin option decrease conversion, then you can conclude that adding Bitcoin is a bad idea and adding Bitcoin would decrease conversion **with your UI, business, and customers** (further tests across market segments are required to draw general conclusions, as you well know).  But you still can't conclude *why* that is: whether it's a reputation issue with Bitcoin, an issue of more choices = less action, an issue with the target demographic of your business not being Bitcoin savvy, an issue of people preferring not to spend Bitcoin on the product type (for example, I'm sure BTC VPS and VPN providers are getting tons of subscriptions while BTC makeup sellers are not), etc.  This all requires further research, backed by more traditional market analysis techniques.
So don't be too hasty to draw conclusions is all I'm saying.  Especially with a corpus consisting of two very specific A/B tests with little useful data.  These are starting points for future investigation/experimentation, not scientific evidence of any conclusions as they are often peddled as.  Again, this is quite obvious.  Whereas this is ridiculous nonsense (and yet somehow upvoted?):


The whole point of science is to question and doubt results.  If you blindly accept 2 small-corpus A/B tests as proof of anything, you are equally as unscientific as the anti-vaxxers and creationists who cite the same corpus of ~20 papers as evidence for their arguments.

How you store the secret has nothing to do with attestation.  You can have tamper-evident memory on a specialized chip running non-programmable firmware that stores the same secret with a multisig wallet, no attestation needed.
And extracting secrets off a TPM is possible, just expensive.  If you can do it once and exploit through a large doublespend, may be worth it.  Forget about insider incentives.
Again, the scheme gives you nothing over multisig implemented similarly.

Wallet A sends to Wallet B, both of which support attestation.  The user extracts the backup seed for Wallet B onto a non-attested device called Wallet C, spending coins on B and C at the same time.  B doesn't notice the spend from C and attests that it's secure, where a miner might include C's transaction first, invalidating the transaction of B.
Alternatively Wallet A does not support attestation and Wallet B does.  Wallet B is created by importing the private key of Wallet A, then gets coins sent and attested from Wallet C.  A and B can now together double spend.
Unless your wallet completely hides private key information from the user, such attestation is useless.  If the wallet does hide private key information from the user, there are a whole different set of issues at play (notice no Bitcoin wallet currently does this).
Again, I'm unconvinced that attestation solves double spend.
@_date: 2015-08-25 18:07:33
Correct, but while trusted chips provide some protection against side channel and physical extraction of secrets, you still have to worry about these things as they're still likely possible for a sophisticated actor (again, difficult to audit something as tamper proof as an outsider without significant expense).  And the easier physical attacks (for example, camera surveillance during backup seed generation or backup seed theft) are still possible.  I guarantee you nobody is using power/timing analyses to steal Trezor seeds when they can just steal the piece of paper that comes with it.  These attacks can also be mitigated by requiring a secret not stored on-device, like Trezor's passcode, for full generation of the seed.
On the other hand, you have to trust third party execution environments that you have no control over or say in.  This is why I think that this kind of solution is less secure than a hardware wallet, though again more secure than an unsecured Android wallet on an OEM/carrier OS.  You are correct though, it is all about compromises and being clear about potential attack surfaces while being aware of your personal threat model and acting appropriately.  For 99% of users, such trusted execution environments are likely sufficient for their threat model, and if they are as convenient as standard smartphone wallets for users already using the latter it's a net win for Bitcoin security.

Yes, I am sure.  I'd rather not talk about how I know, but see [this Quora post for more information](  Plenty of low level employees get away with non-compliance, and it is definitely overreaching in the opinion of most.  But I could never see a CEO trading large positions without the firm knowing, it would be way too easy to get a lawsuit out of that and their reputation would be ruined.  Not to mention if it could even be remotely construed as being in a space the firm has positions in, it can be considered insider trading and hiding it evidence of such.
These rules are intended to prevent pretty much exactly the situation you laid out, where a firm employee acts for and with the capital or information of the firm towards the ultimate goal of their own self interest / profit on their own positions.

You are proffering nonsense, falsehoods, and untruths.  One at a time:


From your competitor: 
So good BWallet was able to duplicate it.  Independent third parties can audit that implementation is honest with equipment costing around $10k.


You can compile on multiple platforms with an open source compiler and inspect the binary of the firmware.  If they are identical, and if the hardware is implemented honestly (addressed previously), you've checked the machine operations being performed.  Barring compiler vulnerabilities (which for an open source compiler can be similarly audited) you have no attack vector there.  Soon enough we'll have verifiable C &lt;&gt; machine compilers that provide mathematical proof certificates of correct translation checkable by third-party theorem proving software over a core auditable semantics of the two languages, but until then the previous approach is sufficient. 
None of this is possible with proprietary software.


See here: 
Basically you need a microscope and some reconstruction software.  You can audit your own or have third parties audit random shipments.  Keep in mind that sometimes you need acids, etc., but it is possible to manufacture the device to be easily auditable, especially given the simplicity of the devices we're talking about (they ain't Intel CPUs).


Again, I would disagree.  It depends on your implementation of Android.  If you've compiled AOSP without Google services or further apps, I would say that is more secure than your approach.  If you are using carrier-bundled crapware then fine.


under normal usage conditions, fine.  But it's nowhere near the security of a real open hardware wallet, and I would even argue that it's less secure than an open standard wallet application on Android.
Sorry, going to get back to my day job as a security professional ;).  And I'll end as I started:

LOL!  Square, Venmo, and PayPal make their money off data mining and selling information, and have complaints of them that could span *volumes* (Google fuck PayPal for more info).  They regularly deny users, freeze accounts, and more.  There's a reason why PayPal's attempt at a digital currency flopped, unlike Bitcoin.  The regular user doesn't understand the full implications of using such services yet, but they are slowly waking up to this and they know enough to know these companies suck.


LOL!  Nope, Bitcoin ATMs, gifts, transfers from banked people, BTC-for-gift-card, and BTC-for-cash services like localbitcoins.com and Mycelium LocalTrader (to name a few).  In popular areas like NYC you also have the Bitcoin center where you can exchange for cash.  I've bought Bitcoin without a bank plenty of times.


Right, but currently most people are not on super low fee services for some reason or other.  Look at WU or some similar service.  Obviously we're assuming that in the next few years, the friction between converting Bitcoin and fiat will decrease.  This has been the trend thusfar though - in 2011, you couldn't even buy Bitcoins.  In 2012, you had to use Dwolla or some other shady "ekash" provider to get money into Gox.  Now we have Coinbase, Circle, SnapCard, etc.  And BTC remittances are frictionless - I can use BitWage to transfer 20% of each paycheck automatically into Bitcoin to my family, keeping the rest in fiat.  Or I can do it in my PJ's on a Sunday night at 2AM with a week long bank holiday in front of us.  Regardless of whether anybody I'm sending to has a bank account.
Inclusiveness, antifragility, programmability, and the other characteristics I mentioned are not niche characteristics.

You can securely accept 0-conf as long as it's propagated to a majority of the network (can be measured through a set of trusted nodes or probabilistically using a sufficiently large set of randomly selected nodes).  Those nodes who received the original transaction will then reject any conflicting transactions from their mempool entirely.  
Unless the person who's paying you colludes with or owns the mining pool that will mine the next block, and given that the TX has a high chance of being included in the next block (measured by the priority formula depending on coinbase age, fees, and amount), there is no risk in accepting payment this way.  The propagation time is also under a few seconds.  This is how both Bitpay and Coinbase (and any decent processor) operate, and if you think you know a severe enough security flaw feel free to try to fraud them out of some money.
For critically high value transactions to prevent against miner attacks, waiting for a confirm should be no problem.

Obviously any centralized system officially adopted by a bank will be cheaper and more efficient than a decentralized system.  Duh.
But it will be inherently worse for so many reasons.  How can I send you $50k right now over the Internet with such a fee and no counterparty risk on your side?  How can I send 10% of my salary to my family in Mexico, who doesn't happen to have an account at one of the five participating banks?  How can I do this all from the comfort of my own home, with no human interaction?  How can I use this system to publish an account number and get small donations/payments/contributions for myself from a large number of global users, each with their own financial services with many unbanked, at no fraud risk to myself?  How can I do these things without revealing my identity or being tracked?  This is really only the tip of the iceberg.
Bitcoin doesn't compete on efficiency alone.  It competes on efficiency, transparency, openness, antifragility, programmability, and inclusiveness.  This system has none of those.
And by the way, those spreads go down as liquidity increases.  If both you and the recipient are using Circle, you can do a 0 spread/fee transfer to any supported bank account (or with a ~1% legacy financial fee to any credit card).

Yeah, but any "spread" (it's really more the difference between the price BitPay sells at and the market rate they charge the buyer) comes off the buyer, not the seller.  The seller gets the exact amount they charge into the bank account, every time, to the penny.  That's the point of the service in fact, predictability.
Also, why would Newegg need the enterprise plan?  I could see them sitting comfortably on either of the other plans, especially if they have their own engineers handling integration.  Either way, if you have no source about what Newegg is paying (or what Bitpay is charging as the price is no longer listed), you're as good as talking out your ass.

The flaws are not in Krugman's work, but in economics as a field.  If you view it as a hard empirical science rather than an art or branch of philosophy, it is *extremely* easy to be mislead.  From the same statistics you can use different models, data, analysis techniques, definitions, and arguments to reach opposite but equally legitimate conclusions.  In fact, this is quite frequent in economics.  For more info, see:
My favorite personal example is the definition of "rational".  Some economists will assume this means an informed, logically considered decisions.  Others will take rational as meaning "any conclusion reached by a human being without coercion", to include impulses/wants/emotions.  
You can read two papers with the same arguments by two different economists that come to opposite conclusions, simply from unreliability of definitions.  Hell, try to find a definition for "economics" that has consensus among 100% of economists.  You can't.  That is never the case in math or physics, where there is little ambiguity in empirical data allowing for personal biases to color conclusions in such a drastic way, and nobody disagrees about what "entropy" or "integral function" actually means.

I want to respond to all this consensus talk by saying that all that matters is the **consensus of the users**, not the consensus of the devs, moderators, or some nebulous definition of the "community".
Bitcoin was designed so that all that matters is the consensus of the **users** of the software.  The consensus of the developers is irrelevant except as a source for informing user consensus.  The consensus of the moderators is similarly irrelevant.
To reach consensus, users must be able to test alternate implementations and moreso to **switch to implementations inconsistent with the consensus of the developers, moderators, or any other smaller subgroup**.  If users cannot switch implementations, they cannot meaningfully achieve consensus, because any decision they make represents an imposition of the coercive will of a smaller group in charge of the "allowed implementations" rather than an organic consensus of the users.
Therefore, any actions which prevent users from exploring alternatives to achieve consensus are actively hostile to such a consensus.  This includes coercion of the community against switching implementations, and coercion of the community against the forking of the currency, all of which are essential tools inherent to the consensus-enabling data structure that brought us all here in the first place.  
Bitcoin is an idea, not a piece of software.  Bitcoin is not Bitcoin Core.  Telling users what Bitcoin is and isn't constitutes deciding for them in a coercive fashion, and is the most counterproductive action one can take towards achieving a consensus of the users.  It also shows an alarming lack of faith in the blockchain datastructure itself, which was built to allow for forking both soft and hard.
Scaling Bitcoin requires consensus of the users.  Consensus of the users requires free discussion, the ability to explore alternate implementations, and the ability to create both soft and hard forks freely.  Consensus requires market participation, and consensus on scaling Bitcoin cannot be meaningfully achieved otherwise, especially not through such policed weekly sandboxed discussions only a few users are still participating in.

Property rights require universal global consensus.  You can either enforce your consensus on property rights through force, or wait for that consensus to naturally materialize from thin air.  The former is the only successful method ever tried in history on any meaningful scale.  Experiments in the latter have failed hopelessly and desperately.

[See my comment here](  Distilled, the advantages are:
- Ability to have a public mempool with all the openness and inclusivity benefits provided by public blockchains, absent from the current system
- Immutable history for free, benefiting audit compliance
- Robust consistency guarantees among even untrusted replicas
- Transactional accountability for free through signed blocks
- Avoidance of complex difficult to analyze P2P consistency protocols like Paxos
- Fast synchronization provided good network bandwidth
- Nice properties like the ability to add or remove arbitrary numbers of datacenters without affecting the operation of the network as a whole
- Byzantine fault resilience 
In reality, the centralized blockchain is quite a common cryptographic structure for a variety of reasons, mainly its ability to be tamper evident.  See the NIST beacon for a good example.  The application of proof of work for true decentralization as implemented in Bitcoin is great and enables a range of revolutionary developments, but is not necessarily helpful to institutions like NSDQ in their current forms.

I must note that the definition of random is "involving unpredictability", so functionally there is no difference between these two terms.  You can certainly have randomness where outcomes are not equally likely.


Gambling absolutely does hinge on randomness.
@_date: 2015-03-31 14:22:05
If something is deterministic, it cannot be unpredictable because you can simply compute it to predict it.


The next Bitcoin block is not deterministic - several valid nonce choices, transaction orderings, transaction inclusions/exclusions, etc. are very much nondeterministic and essentially random (while the code that runs these is deterministic, the execution of the code depends highly on the stochastic environment of any distributed system).  That being said, it is unpredictable.
If you fix the transaction ordering and nonce choice in advance, then the block hash becomes deterministic.  It is also then not unpredictable - anybody can simply run the deterministic algorithm and predict the block.


Anyone who gambles on a predetermined outcome that's already known to the person placing the bet (you could have easily precomputed your hash) is an idiot.  For the bet to be sane, there must be some randomness involved in the input.  Gambling hinges on randomness.




It is.  Even in chaos theory, there is some entropy in the inputs that begets unpredictability.  For something that's deterministic to be unpredictable, there must be some randomness in the input.  Otherwise, predicting is as simple as calculation.  In information theory no hash is unpredictable - you can simply exhaustively compute the output values of all possible inputs.
If you relax your definition to mean computationally unpredictable (where calculation is infeasible), we'd be having an entirely different discussion.  But mathematically, gambling does absolutely hinge on randomness.

Just having something like an open mempool with a standardized transaction format is better than existing shared database solutions.  And existing solutions don't come with an immutable transaction history/ledger that *can* be made public.  The closest that traditional solutions can provide to allowing parties which may trust each other only uneasily to sync and share a database is consensus through something like repeated rounds of Paxos or deference of the network's operation to a third party.  Permissioned blockchains eliminate that need.
The only thing really being centralized is mining/transaction acceptance (obviously this would have to be something other than PoW-based), the network (storage processing and bandwidth) is still decentralized.  And even the centralization introduced can be cryptographic in nature, so it comes with strong accountability and security properties that would make it difficult for any institution to gain advantage in or fundamentally interfere with the system as a whole.  
These players don't care about things like antifragility or censorship resistance because they are the establishment.  An open protocol that produces an immutable history capable of meeting audit requirements as a side effect, with more transparency and assurance than closed systems, is still useful here.

There are plenty of developers with enough background cryptography and distributed systems knowledge to pick up the rest (incentive structure, full understanding of whitepaper and scripting language, understanding of core client code structure) in a few weeks.  I'd even say hundreds of thousands of such developers.  There is simply no economic incentive for them to work on this project right now.  Once someone is willing to pay a developer, that developer will materialize and be trained.
Do you think HFT firms stop trading when they lose programming talent?  Hell no.  Their systems are also highly complex and critical to moving around lots of money, but there are armies of developers willing to learn enough to manage that complexity.  That's your entire job as a developer / computer scientist... to learn about systems enough to move them forward incrementally in a risk-managed fashion.
The only barrier to developer replacement is financial.

I agree that we should create and explore alternative solutions to our issues as a society.  And that in some systems, non-participation is an appropriate response.

Maybe.  But maybe nation states will embrace and integrate Bitcoin instead.  The technology itself won't erode anything, that's a social issue.  If it has the power to make money more fair, transparent, and open though, I say bring it on for whoever wants to adopt the technology.

You say "to a shared database" but you don't name specific solutions.  I assume you're talking about something Paxos-based, because I've given several concrete advantages there.  I won't restate or address any of the (in my opinion) ridiculous tirades you've presented.


No, no I do not.  I have never talked about PoW.  Mining does not have to be PoW.  I use it as a generic term for block discovery (creation of valid blocks).


Please give the name of a specific database package that has Byzantine fault resistance, ability to be deployed and scaled across nodes that can dynamically leave and join the network at any time, provides strong consistency guarantees, comes with an audit history / record, allows for an open transaction / account system, and allows for any participant to be fully aware of the latest global network state in near real time.  The name of a company providing such a package would also be sufficient.  Without this in your reply, you really have 0 argument here.  With it we will have a concrete base for further comparison.


Nothing at stake does not apply to a permissioned system where each block is signed with an auditable key.  Reputation and system participation is *always* at stake.  Anyway I am not talking about proof of stake, you can assume for the purposes of this post that my model is much simpler: new blocks are created by any signers in the set of trusted keys, stamped with some source of truetime (see Google's efforts here), with conflicts within a certain range resolved with a static priority list.  Many other fancier variants are possible but this is simple enough for basic comprehension of the advantages we're dealing with.
Yes, you can design a traditional database to do everything I've stated.  But *one does not exist right now*.  And if it did, it would look a whole lot like... a permissioned blockchain?  For the immutability and audit history, you'd want to take advantage of CRHFs by having a hash chain of some sort.  You'd want blocks of some sort to chunk your updates and send to regulators, stakeholders, etc.  You'd want a cryptographically verifiable transaction standard to maintain "accounts" and "transactions" in the database.  You'd want a P2P-like network to allow for greater participation and lower entry and exit costs.  etc. etc.  It doesn't look like Bitcoin but it looks an awful lot like a blockchain-like structure.
It really is a useful data structure with applications outside PoW censorship resistant systems.  I'm sorry that you can't see them, but there's only so much I can help you with there.

A market is a market regardless of what you're buying or selling.  And depending on your definition of "force" or "fraud", you can argue that most items are bought and sold by humanity have some sort of force or fraud involved in their procurement (natural resources frequently used forced labors, artificially imposed property rights, state monopolies, etc. while manufactured goods and services often employ what could be considered coerced labor forces... hell depending on who you ask all property rights can even be considered fraud and force), and thus none of the markets they are sold on are really markets.

You are incorrect.  The partial censorship of XT is far worse than full censorship of XT, already an intellectually reprehensible endeavor.  If you don't understand why free discussion and information is necessary to the informed, validated rational analysis of any issue, you should not be participating in this discussion at all.
Because all the censored threads and comments are pro-XT and encouraging the discussion of XT and hardforking comments, and because plenty of negative posts about XT are allowed, the discussion on XT or the possibility of any hard fork is heavily skewed against.  Saying "XT is not really censored" when only posts criticizing XT or skirting XT or hard fork advocacy are allowed is like saying Russia Today is an uncensored news source when it comes to Putin, because they write about him all the time.
It simply does not work this way.  The moderation of this subreddit has taken an ideological stance on this issue and takes appropriate action towards this stance, corrupting any discussion that is had on the matter and making it intellectually more of an exercise in masturbatory confirmation bias than a free discussion.

I don't really have time to break it down for you much further if you lack the intuition for the obvious, but I'll briefly address the current points to stimulate your own thoughts in this reply only.  If you don't understand it that's fine, I'm not involved in any private blockchain efforts and they will succeed regardless of your input or opinion (as will the truly decentralized ones, with different applications and markets).  BTW, when I say the public, I mean people with access to the infrastructure who can submit and/or relay transactions, but not mine.  This can be the public or it can be a superset of the mining institutions.


Transactions can be submitted through an open network.  Any member of the public (regardless of whether they run a node or not) can maintain a mempool of all pending transactions without depending on any specific party, essentially maintaining a representation of the current network state with a high degree of accuracy.  Transactions would be difficult to discriminate against, because once submitted to and accepted by the bandwidth backbone of the infrastructure, mining discrimination would be open and auditable.  All of this comes for free with the infrastructure.


This is incorrect and a misunderstanding of my use of immutability.  Technically yes, the history is mutable.  But if the history *were* mutated, any member of the public with the unmutated history would be able to post a mathematical proof of mutation (by posting the signed and valid real history, if conflicting with the current network state, it is proof that one or the other must be manipulated and invalid.  because of collision resistance it would be impossible to modify past blocks without forking the entire chain and modifying all future blocks as well, so such tampering would be *immediately* evident to any node.  tamper resistant properties of paxos and other consensus algorithms are less clear).
Again, look at what NIST is doing with their beacon.  This is an entirely private chain with no PoW, used for tamper resistance.  These guarantees and ease of detection are stronger than those of other db synchronization systems.


This is only PoW blockchains.  With other solutions, you can store as much or as little as you please (individual or institution), and processing power is minimal.  PoW is a solution for antifragility, censorship resistance, and true public decentralization, none of which are required for permissioned blockchains.

I don't think you understand.  There are two consenting parties in the transaction in that definition: the seller and the consumer.  These are the parties' whose consent sets the prices.  External parties (like you) do not need to consent.  For example, if I buy 5000BTC from the US government, we are both freely (without restriction) and consensually (we each agree) transacting.  Whether you think the transaction is immoral or without consent is immaterial - imposing your opinion here without the consent of the parties transacting (me and the US government) would be regulating the market by imposing subjective restrictions on transactions.
The free market requires only the consent of the buyer and the seller, not that of society at large and certainly not that of yourself.
If I am selling art and you are buying it, and we both consent to the transaction freely, the transaction meets the criteria of one in the free market.  This is regardless of whether "fraud" or "theft" is part of the past history of an item being transacted, which would be a highly subjective value judgment.

If I beat you with a rake, steal your phone, and sell it on the market to a willing participant, the market is free.  The transaction between me and the other party is consensual and unrestricted.
If I beat you with a rake, steal your phone, and sell it on the market to a willing participant, and the government forces me to pay a tax or face jail time because it is a phone sale of over $5, the market is not free.  The transaction is restricted.
If I beat you with a rake, steal your phone, and sell it on the market to a willing participant, and the government forces me to cancel the transaction and returns the phone to you, the market is not free.  The transaction is restricted.
Not all markets are inherently free.  In fact I don't know of any that are completely free right now.
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:23:41
Agreed with you.  What I take issue with is this:


Trade is force or fraud agnostic.  Both force and fraud are subjective concepts and moral judgments.  Free market trade can include force or fraud (as in the US government selling coins, or a thief selling coins, etc).  Free market transactions can and often do include force in their chain of custody without being themselves forceful (buyer and seller agree on the sale of a disputed item).  The essence of free market transactions is that they do not systemically consider such subjective moral judgments outside of those of the transacting parties, so they may be based on "force" or "fraud" or not and remain equally valid in a free market.  What cannot happen by definition is force or coercion of the buyer and seller to modify the terms of the transaction, which is a separate issue entirely from force being used in the procurement or somewhere in the history/chain of custody of the transactional instrument.  
The first can easily be checked by asking the two parties whether they were required to modify their transactional terms for external reasons.  Eliminating the second requires a broad social consensus on the point at which a transaction is based on "fraud" or "force" outside of the opinion of the buyer and seller, and is thus a form of regulation.
I also take issue with his point that:


a.k.a. that by definition of the free market, force or fraud cannot be  included.  The original implication in this thread was that the government selling these coins was *not* a free market action (I am replying to a [topmost comment]( imploring us to get back to the free market after this sale is over).  I'm glad we both disagree here.

Try generating private keys until you find *a single one* that corresponds to a public key previously used on the network.  So don't try bruteforcing a specific address (much harder), but just try to recover the private key of any address previously used by the network without using a keyspace reduction attack (weak entropy input, backdoored PRNG, etc).  There's a reason this hasn't happened - yes, it is probabilistic, but so is the entire universe.  When you slap your hand against a brick wall there is a chance (look up quantum tunneling) it will pass through.  That being said, we could all stand here our whole lives slapping our hands against brick walls and leave disappointed.

What I meant was that there's no point hating the banks themselves exclusively without also hating the toxic influence they exert in every aspect of our lives, including governance (the same influence that enables them to continue operating with impunity).  
The abuses you refer to are as a result of a complex power structure designed to keep banks wealthy, and designed to grant them far more influence over the government than any consumer has (through political spending).  Furthermore, this same power structure perpetuates a debt-based economy in which all individuals are constantly beholden to these financial institutions through regular payments, trading their economic freedom for consumption and spending beyond their means.
It's a bad feedback loop - banks influence consumers, governments, and monetary policies to gain more money, power, influence, and control, which in turn is leveraged to further manipulate consumers, governments, and monetary policies.
The banks would be better off if they were strictly regulated and the laws already on the books were strictly enforced (hint: they aren't enforced at all), the government would be better off if the toxic absolutist control private banks play in public policy decisions and the enormous role they play in elections were eliminated, etc.  
I think it's a systemic failure that as a society we are entirely reliant on money, and the policy governing this money is entirely controlled by a small group of private interests.  Removing that toxic influence would also lend to reimagining how large portions of the system it currently corrupts works.  Bitcoin could free governments from the banks just as easily as it could free you from the banks; there's no reason why decisions about medical care and social security should be dependent consistently on discussions about budget, QE, etc.  There's no reason we should be required to shave pennies off welfare, education, research, and other government functions to create trillions of dollars of debt propping up financial institutions with a history of defrauding everyone they can get their hands on.
Of course nobody will ever be satisfied with a government, and that's a good thing - it's a very messy iterative  process that only promises to stochastically improve in the long term :).  So FU to the banks and the underlying power structures allowing them to continue operating as is, which span government, consumers, and everything.
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:57:20


Right, but that doesn't affect the freedom of the market.  The freedom is a property of the market structure - can two transactions between consumer and seller proceed with only the consent of those two in an unrestricted fashion?  The government selling Bitcoins does not restrict any Bitcoin transactions I would send to you, thus the underlying market is still "free".  Transactions still proceed with consent between the buyer and seller, and those transactions are free from outside intervention.
If the government were to tax a percentage of every transaction regardless of their involvement, this would be intervention as it would define terms for and thus restrict the freedom of transactions to which the government is not a party.


Yes, but this is not intervention in the Bitcoin market, it's intervention in Ross Ulbricht's life.  Their actions here do not affect the freedom of transactions on the Bitcoin network or the freedom with which I can transact Bitcoin with you.  They affect only the financial freedom of American citizens subject to the government's rulings, using a power structure outside the scope of any market.
Again, if I steal coins from you and sell them on the market, the market is still free as long as I don't attempt to structurally restrict transactions in the market.  Same goes for the government.
When the government intervenes in a Bitcoin transaction from me to you they will have regulated or intervened in the market structurally.

Yeah, even things like the "paper belt" move us towards a decentralized society (remember, the Internet is a "paper belt" invention, born built and funded).

The market has nothing to do with morality - anybody, including governments, can participate with coins obtained by any means, including coercion, outright theft, voluntary purchases, etc.  Thieves and cheats are just as legitimate a part of a free market as any other actor, as is anybody who is buying or selling goods for any reason, regardless of whether you agree with the reason.
The person you are replying to is correct.

DNS is just as centralized (looking at you, ICANN).

You seem to be projecting your own moral value judgments onto market actions.  The market is merely an abstraction of a small subset of human behaviors (value exchange).  In a free market, anyone is free to buy or sell from anybody they please (this is in fact the definition).  Whether these transactions are moral or not is outside the scope of the abstraction.  Once you enforce your moral value judgments on the market (theft is not permissible, externalities not permissible, etc.), it is no longer a free market but a restricted one.
Personally I think a restricted market (which is not transaction-agnostic) is a superior structure to a free market for such reasons.  But the point stands, if you want a free market, you have to let governments participate too.

Wow, your entire post was a snide and derisive train wreck / shit pile.  But in case you have even a smidge of seriousness in there beyond the pure trolling, you don't need to retool anything to add Bitcoin as a payment mechanism.  
FedEx can add Bitcoin just as easily to their infrastructure as they can add any other bank (or currency), if not more easily (as there are pretty clear well supported and open source interfaces to do so programatically).  Hell, it took one engineer at Dell less than a week to add it to their process.  You don't need complex accounts, you don't need permission, you just need an engineer, and you can interface with pretty much any existing settlement infrastructure (SEPA, SWIFT, ACH, etc etc).
The problems you're describing simply don't exist in practice.

My argument is very simple:
- Free markets are transaction agnostic by definition.  If two otherwise identical transactions are handled differently by the market because of external intervention predicated on some transactional property (buyer, seller, amount, item, etc.), the market is no longer *free*.
- Globally disallowing participation of actors you feel have used "force" or "fraud" in a free market is a form of external regulation and thus contradicts the "free" in free market.
- The choice rests at the individual level about whether to do business with another actor in a free market.  It's my choice whether to transact with anyone I want, including the US government, in the free market, regardless of what you think of the morality of their actions.  This is by definition.
I'm not sure what definition you're operating under (as you haven't provided one other than to say actors committing "force" or "fraud" are inherently disallowed, a definition relying heavily on individual interpretation of those words and with no clear mechanism for evaluation or enforcement of whether there is "fraud" or "force" anywhere in the chain of custody of an item being transacted), but it's not one I've heard before.  I think I'm done here now.

It's not a new idea.  As someone else has pointed out, Tails has had this for years.

It's not a free world, that much is for sure.  But the government selling Ross's coins still has nothing to do with how free the Bitcoin market is (or any future retroactive scrutiny they can and will apply regardless).

Not even close.  If you think 100% of humanity will use Bitcoin you are delusional. And I'm both a big believer in the token and heavily invested.

Yes, I know.  They can be "hacked" (stolen from the user), but not by pure bruteforce without some sort of keyspace reduction.  "They can't be bruteforced" is entirely true, it is not a deception just like "so you can't walk through walls" is not a deception (though both are technically possible with infinitesimal probability).
Like I said, if you think you can bruteforce a single key that has ever been used on the network without keyspace reduction, write a paper on it.  You'll rock the Bitcoin world and have instant prestige.

It'll keep generating until it finds a sufficiently long block of unused addresses, then assume those are fresh for you.

The point is that the free market as an abstraction of human activity (unrestricted buy / sell activity between two parties) is inherently agnostic to the morality of the underlying action.  The structure of the abstraction is identical regardless.


This is an individual choice.  I'm free to tolerate it if I want to, and to transact with the US government or any other entity in a free marketplace.  Again, this is by definition.

You say that like I could even if I wanted to :).  Cheers.

I think it was pretty clearly the implication.  I'm going to quote again:


Selling the stolen coins will have no effect on how free the market is one way or another.
I also disagree that repossessing and selling coins counts as government market intervention, which in that definition is used to suggest government intervention in regulating transactions between consumers and sellers (eg - A and B where neither A or B are governmental).  In this case, the government "intervention" in the market is creating their own transactions as per the government-agnostic market rules.  I'd argue this is participation rather than intervention in the market.
I do agree that the government used force in obtaining the coins, but again, this to me is irrelevant as to whether the market they are sold on is free or manipulated as long as the force is not being used to manipulate other market transactions.
If the government came in and required all Bitcoin transactions from A to B have a log or record, that would be intervention in the market.  Coming in and selling something they own (whether you think it's rightful or not) to me is pretty clearly participation rather than intervention, especially when the action imposes no other restrictions on consensual market transactions between consumers and sellers.
So, tl;dr
- Government sells coins to consenting consumer -&gt; coin market is still free
- Government steals coins from rightful owner -&gt; coin market is still free (though society may not be)
- Government owns coins -&gt; coin market is still free
- Government regulates transactions, or imposes limitations on who can spend Bitcoin or how -&gt; coin market is no longer free, as transactions between consumers and sellers are now restricted
I believe this is the most commonly accepted view of what government intervention in a free market is (meaning intervention in  transactions between two non-government parties)
