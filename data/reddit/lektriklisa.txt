Some losers bitch that a used hardware wallet is a bad idea but the truth, and fact, is if the wallet passes the software authentication check the hardware is good. Many thick headed individuals here who think they are educated prove their ignorance by arguing against.
If the device connects and passes the check, the device is authentic.
The manufacturer even states that.
There are no known instances of a compromised hardware wallet running malware.

Why complicate matters by selling and paying capital gains, and then possibly again later. That's more money out of your pocket. Just hodl.  A fool and his money are soon parted.

You need to edit the source code and then mine the first block. That starts your chain.  You will also need to add your IP address to the code. Others who run your client will need to know who to connect to and download the chain from.

Bitcoin is sticking it to the noobs who think they can get rich quick. Ha ha
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:51:47
Everyone is forgetting that it is in BCash's blockchain as well, and every other forked coin out there.
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:22:37
Exactly.  I just think the fee is pretty steep.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:02:04
Can't wait!
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:01:53
What good will contacting to the press do?  And I'm going to guess the IRS will still want you to pay taxes on the amount of bitcoin you no longer posses.  Unless that is your plan all along.... Tax evasion. ☺️

We all knew that.

Why does Bitcoin need an embassy? I see no diplomatic reason for it. Or is embassy really a front for for a money laundering, high priced exchange?

Haha you haven't seen steep, noob. ☺️
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:33:34
What Ver doesn't understand is that nobody gives a shit about the white paper.  Bitcoin is Bitcoin, Bcash is a fork. That's all people care about. Why he keeps using the white paper as an excuse is beyond me.
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:09:18
Kiss me
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:11:58

Your better off hiding your private key in an image and uploading it to your Google drive if you want to store it electronically.

I think I read somewhere that if you wanted to transfer bitcoin to your own wallet you need to subscribe to a monthly plan. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:40:23
maybe we better take off... yeah, right.

Use Square to put the money in a bank account, then pull the cash and use a bitcoin ATM. Sure, you'll pay fees at the bitcoin ATM, but it's still free coin since the card was a gift.

What? That he will never ever set foot in the United States again? Hahahahahahahaha
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:51:34
Also, why are they even talking about this?  They make it sound like every fucking person in the US is involved with Bitcoin when in reality only a fraction of a fraction is. So I ask again, why are they even talking about it?  Probably because some deep bank pocket is giving them cash. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 22:45:57

"Starting an ICO....." Hilarious

Bitcoin is bitcoin, and bcash is bcash. People need to realize that nothing is going to change, nothing. That's how it is and that's how it's going to be. People need to get off the 'white paper' boat because frankly, it's a pitiful excuse and nobody cares.   Times change. Things change.  
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:02:43
Or people received their tax refunds.
