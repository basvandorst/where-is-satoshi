Thank you for your contribution you're a good person
seeing you giving your wealth to those who deserve it really prove that money isn't everything, I recently lost all my bitcoins and people kept telling me that money not everything but no one prove it! 
I will try donate. and keep your identity hidden you're much awesome like that :)
Thanks,
