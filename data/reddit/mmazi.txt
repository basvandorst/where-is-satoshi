I've also had very positive experience with The Rock Trading support. I've only contacted them once, but their reply was extremely fast (in less than 20 minutes), very thorough and to the point, and generally extremely helpful. I've had a brief exchange of e-mails with them and the issue was resolved quickly, correctly, and without any misunderstandings at all.
The issue was was about lifting the limit for withdrawing PPC via Ripple.

Sorry, I'm confused by this sentence -- which "the[y]", "their" refers to "the operators" and which to "miners in other pools"?

As far as I know, they just don't provide services to users with IP addresses from USA. The site is still up for me (I'm not in USA) and I was able to play a few days ago.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but BIP100, if it is ever implemented, will also create a hard fork. Why is nobody discussing this?

But the way I understand this, 15yw didn't receive any coins from 1FoVb, but they both received (like many other people) some coins from REDCOINS.co which is a kind of a faucet. I doubt that people receiving millibitcoins from redcoins.co know anything about each other..

I notified Bitcoin-24 of strange things happening in my account two weeks ago. After a repeated notification 4 days ago their reply was "everything seems fine on your account, Don't worry about that :)". I withdrew my money quickly then.

By "withdrawal attempt" you mean BTC withdrawal?

If you decide to scam the payer, that's easy with Bitcoin and not so easy with Paypal where transactions can be disputed by the payer and reversed. This is a big advantage for the payer.
