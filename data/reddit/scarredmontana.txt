I never heard anything about the "due to some Facebook board member"....
I thought it was only because he was tweety/saying things and people kept blaming him for trying to increase Litecoin's price. So he eventually gave away all his Litecoin away and said that the conflict of interest in his Litecoin ownership is gone. Then a lot of people said he was a dumbass since now the Litecoin "CEO" doesn't have a stake in how Litecoin performs.

Yeah, I'm not sure if Facebook login on a site means anything. I can add Facebook login to my shitty ass portfolio site right now. A lot of people recommend it rather than coming up with your own password encryption storage mechanism.
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:27:40
Well, yeah for Facebook, but in terms of the two companies, I don't think a direct connection can be made that a simple login means the two companies have begun collaboration.

Why don't you trust the leadership?
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:35:14
Or just buy straight from GDAX......
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:01:35
You can prepare for that. They just won't. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:17:44
That was my first response to you man. How about you chill out a bit and think before replying....? I'm a totally different guy.....


Well, I won't be manipulated by your 747 stats without any sources....so there's your answer.


I got wrecked so hard.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:24:59
Exactly. 


Maybe if you weren't buying so many gifts you'd be financially stable. I get that your Mom is having a hard time, but is throwing expensive gifts at her for the short run making things better? Instead of buying a $500 iPad, you could've taken her out to a nice dinner. There's so many cringey parts to this story.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:47:09
Oh I'm debating with a racist. I didn't think you'd go that far. Sorry, I just can't take anything you say seriously. You're coming off as an Alex Jones-type. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:53:03
I saw upside. I don't anymore.


Of course. Who wouldn't want to get into this market right now? 
But besides short-term profit, why Bitcoin? It seems there are so many cons and so little pros about Bitcoin. The "store of value" rhetoric, that has only been formulated in the past couple months due to long transaction costs, has also extremely little upside.  
Most of my crypto-currency investment is in Bitcoin. I'd say about 90%, but as days to weeks pass, it seems to me that the community is much more cult-ish, a little more toxic, and I can't seem to shake away the fact that the only reason I have Bitcoin is because of its USD price - nothing more. 
Again, why Bitcoin?

There could be 10000000 contributors, but if Blockstream controls the merge requests and the overall technical roadmap, then they own the repository and the community. This is why forks are a thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:25:31


Ah...deflecting. No sources. You got wrecked.
But not to deflect from the actual argument. You're not at all worried? This is early Bitcoin and it's looking bad in terms of energy use. Would you support a coin that was less intensive on energy use and served the same purpose? Or do you just not give one damn shit about energy costs?
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:23:34
Well, your biggest proponent doesn't seem to think so: 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:27:04
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:24:54
The energy usage isn't surpassing just third world countries. Would you say Ireland is a third world country? 
For a platform in a relatively young stage that really hasn't been adopted by the general public, that is truly worrisome.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:19:51
Along with the post from there's also the shit ton of posts blasting people for selling when Bitcoin was actually useful. There's PSA on the front page of the subreddit warning everyone not to sell:
 
Then there's all the stories of people actually using Bitcoin who hate themselves for using it properly.


Bitcoin is the exact opposite of what people thought it's going to be. I seriously don't see any upside to it other than it's brand name. 
No. I don't hold any investment to Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:58:26
lol....welcome to the community!
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:06:12
I think you've answered your own question. I can host my project on Github, tell everyone I'm open source and all my code is peer reviewed and tested, but it doesn't mean shit unless there's open contribution by different parties. I think Blockstream holds the development power, and I don't think they're too privy to having opposing opinions on the development of the codebase.

If you go to his repository it is posted there: 
I don't want to post it since people may not believe me, but I'll direct people towards it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:14:56
Lol, yeah. Unless you have some mult-million dollar operation in the works.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:39:36
So you let in max 100K and stop selling tickets. Is this a hard concept?
If I'm running a business, and I decide that I want to let the Beatles come play knowing that hundreds of millions of people may get hurt and injured due to overcrowding and a possible stampede, but I decide to just onboard everyone and their mothers and then a stampede happens, and I'm like uuhhhh I never planned for a stampede. Oh well. Sorry for everyone.

I was trying to sell at 7800 just in case there was a sizeable pull back, but I'll just sit for now....looks like it's gonna hover for a bit so I'm not mad really...
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:57:34
So do I still have my coins or not? I hope I do since I tried cancelling my stop order...
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:10:01
I would figure it's much more difficult. Are small players still mining Bitcoin? I thought it was just server farms running the game now...
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:09:37
No it doesn't. There are industries out there to make sure outages don't happen. It's not that unreasonable to expect an exchange that has had months to years of preparation for these type of events. This is how your product loses millions of users. You become untrustworthy after multiple crashes.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:20:30
I bought both. I made up the ~800 in Xbox One X and games in about two days...but I also have a lot more than $500 in. Put some more in and ride the wave like us!
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:41:50
FUCK COINBASE. I was trying to short the market, but I couldn't sign in because the device I used 15 minutes ago was "forgotten" and I had to authorize it....now I hodl.

That font on the front cover...........................ugh.

Thank you! Someone tried to tell me that I don't appreciate and understand the technology enough to complain that their site is down. I work in the fucking industry that makes sure this shit doesn't happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:49:25
I had a stop order at 9700, I don't know if that kicked in or not. The price was down to 9000, and my order was still showing as present. Now if I try to cancel the order, it won't cancel....
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:29:41
Seeing as how SegWit2x just got called off, all the cryptos are booming so........probably no dip soon.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:13:13
A lot of people are also expecting dips after the CME futures begin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:03:51
It does mean it's a shit platform. It's a very bad look especially when you're running an exchange. You would rather spend the money and time to make sure this doesn't happen then having this shit storm happen.

Ya'll people don't know how to embrace family. God help me if I'm too cheap to buy my wife's father a gift for turning FUCKING 50 years old....

Yeah, there's a mutli-billion dollar industry dedicated to this. It's called DevOps. People have been planning for it for years.

If I had sold at 7800 and gotten back in at 7650.....can no one do math here?
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:18:51
I'm confused with the notion of bitcoin, or better yet, with people's expected use of bitcoin. It sounds like Peter Thiel claims that bitcoin is just a store of value so, in essence, when you're ready to back out you receive your dollars. He says it's not to be used as a payment system. However, there's also a large presence that denounces government currency, and they want to get rid of it all so bitcoin will just be the currency.  
From my point of view, I just see Bitcoin price rising, and I'm happy because I get more dollars when I decide to sell. When that point comes, I don't care how many bitcoin I have, I care about the amount of dollars I just acquired from selling all my bitcoin. I think that's the majority opinion, right? Especially with all these posts claiming "how do I sell all my bitcoin so I can receive my hundreds of thousands of dollars instead?"
@_date: 2017-10-20 08:35:13
Question here: Say something terrible happens, like a huge drop... wouldn't it be better to have your coins on the Exchange so that you could pull out faster? That is, instead of having to wait to transfer your coins back from wallet to Exchange...
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:21:52
You mean, why so bearish?

I can understand memes even when they get annoying as hell and block informative content. Some are funny at times, but I've seen so many comments and posts of people borrowing from the bank or putting all their life savings into Bitcoin that it's become worrisome. I'm not sure if they are just spouting shit, but the meer occurrence of these comments have me questioning the user base.
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:32:40
Damn man, you don't have to prove yourself just because some random dude called you out.

I just stayed in a private room at an AirBnB. The host is leaving this week to go to Thailand. After a couple wine drinks, he tells me that he has a boyfriend there. This is bringing back too much right now....
