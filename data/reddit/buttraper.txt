Ok, situation has changed a little. I have the wallet open and transferred 0.001btc to a new wallet, but im getting errors from Electrum that I need to upgrade.
So, I can, but im nervous about not being able to log back in. I know the password, but I have lost the seed. Can I recover the seed or if I upgrade Electrum will I need it to log back in again?
