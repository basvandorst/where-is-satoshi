Buying in one market and selling it in another for a higher price is called arbitrage, and it's perfectly normal and legal (as long as you rightfully pay the taxes that come with the profit). That's why prices between exchanges are mostly the same. If any profit opportunity appears, someone takes it. 
However, due to reasons someone already commented here, when dealing with PayPal, there's a high risk involved, and that explains the price difference.

I think there was also at least one miner who didn't award himself with the full 50btc with the coinbase transaction. Not that it will make much difference, but since we're looking at the details...

Seems to me that you weren't paying with bitcoin, but with fiat

He asked about the Satoshi being equivalent to a dollar's cent, not a dollar.
Both your calculations are right, relative to each one's Satoshi value

You can "send money" to a bitcoin address. I heard there was something where they ask you what currency you want to use. If you chose BTC, it would show you your balance as BTC after a deposit.
@_date: 2016-06-30 07:00:03
What I meant was you were not paying with bitcoin, since the merchant wasn't receiving bitcoins. Bitpay was doing all that work of converting to fiat for you, and charged a percentage for it. 
I haven't read all the comments here, but I'm sure someone said the the beauty of bitcoin is exactly not needing a middleman for that. You can send money to the merchant directly and both of you could reap the benefits. But since it's not widely accepted, there's all that conversion going on, and that costs money.

Copy the receiving address from your phone and send as an email to yourself. Open the email on the PC, copy, paste, ???, profit
(that is, if you're not using phone-to-pc services like pushbullet, airdroid, etc, which it seems you are not)

I see nothing wrong with paying your merchant straight from quadriga. 
But one thing that is mostly agreed upon, is to not leave your btc for too long in an exchange. They have the keys to your money (literally speaking, the keys are very big unique numbers, that when used in the mathematical formulas that power bitcoin, allows your funds to be transferred). Basically, if you don't have the keys, you don't really control the money, and the exchange can simply disappear with it (or go temporarily offline for legitimate reasons, but locking you out). So it's common practice to immediately withdraw btc from the exchange into a wallet you control. When setting up a wallet app, read and do everything it tells you to do regarding "backing up your keys". Otherwise, in case of an accident, you might lose your funds forever.

2fa codes sent by SMS are insecure if someone knows your phone number. There are commercial products (ss7 hacking tools) that allow interception of calls and sms, where the only thing needed is the knowledge of your number. Beside any other precaution you take, I suggest also changing your 2fa mode to the Google authenticator / authy totp kind.

Regarding a dual coin wallet, I know Coinomi for Android supports many different coins.

Wow, I'm still inexperienced with different wallets (only ever used one, on my phone), but it seems bitcoin core wallet is the worst possible choice for a "complete newbie"! This is going to leave a bad taste in OP's mouth. I hope he realizes that there are wallets that within 30 seconds of installing (the time to make the backup) you can already receive payments and view your transaction history.
@_date: 2016-06-11 01:36:37
That's basically what a paper wallet is. On one side there's a code with just the address so you can check its balance, and on the other side there's a code with the private key so you can transfer coins out of it (usually sweep the entire balance to an address you control, modern wallets have a simple one-click sweep option)
@_date: 2016-06-25 01:50:32
By the time the last coin in mined, we will all be long dead, it's more than 120 years away. 
The scarcity is also a very relative thing, since bitcoin is almost infinitely divisible. Even if a single bitcoin reaches a value of one million dollars, the smallest subdivision (one Satoshi) will be worth one cent. And if it is ever needed, since it's all software, more decimal places can be coded in.

Along with the suggestions here, why not also list them where the other packages are? Wouldn't that make more people at least curious about what that Magic Internet  Money is, possibly bringing more adoption?
Unless I'm imagining things wrong and there are no other packages...

Completely agree! Is core being marketed as a "download this to get started with bitcoin" kind of thing somewhere? If I was told I'd have to download dozens of gigabytes and process it for days before doing anything, I'd say "f* this shit" and never look at it again!

Actually there's a small difference that goes to the miners as fee, but yeah, I get that part =)

It's pretty cool to see money being broken down, then re-minted into new denomination coins every time!

I don't know any miners, and don't have any contact with mining whatsoever. So are there any sources to these claims? Honest question! It's something I'm  very skeptical about, but no reason to be so, except that for me it always "seems" like facts plucked out of thin air.
@_date: 2016-05-24 07:23:45
Thanks for that!
@_date: 2016-05-24 02:01:13
Did you ask a miner?
Is anyone here a miner and can shine some light on this?
@_date: 2016-05-30 10:38:31
I might be inverting "input" and "output" in my question, but, here it goes. 
When sending from an address, an input must be completely spent, so there is usually one output for the actual value you want to spend, and another output that is the change coming back to me. This part is OK in my head. 
Now, if in my wallet I have many addresses with small amounts of BTC, and I want to send a larger sum to another address, are all those small BTC molten and packaged as a single output (with perhaps another change output going back)? I would assume so, otherwise bitcoins would be broken up smaller and smaller, and eventually everyone would be transacting millions of individual Satoshis =P

Or sweep it into the mycelium wallet right there, and burn the print after a few e confirmations

It's clever because a more naive and greedy person would think "hey, there's 3.7 BTC in that file! Screw Alan, I'm keeping the BTC" and not think deeply about the mistake about to be made.
@_date: 2016-05-24 01:07:37
There is a general buy process at the Bitcoin ATM:
* Verification step (optional and may vary substantially depending on the machine type)
* Provide Bitcoin address for deposit (optionally can be generated and printed/emailed in some ATMs)
* Put cash into the ATM
* Confirm operation (bitcoins sent to the Bitcoin address)
I would print the QR code of my address or bring my phone, since I don't know if these ATMs usually have some form of text input (there are also fewer chances of mistakes)
@_date: 2016-07-22 12:09:56
A purchase is made when your desire to buy something with bitcoin meets the desire of the seller to get paid with bitcoin. Each person has a price point (in fiat currency) where that will happen. 
If you could buy a house for 10BTC now, wouldn't you, even if you believed in the future you could buy the same house with 1 BTC?
@_date: 2016-07-04 10:28:31
I don't see it as "rewarding early adopters". I think it is a technology that should be worth a lot more. Those who see it, acquire BTC while it is still cheap. Eventually, word will catch on, and the price will reach a value that properly reflects it.
@_date: 2016-07-05 02:10:56
Complementing, your wife doesn't need to know any of the details/analogies. Supposing you have 50 BTC in storage, I would start with "Keep the numbers and QR codes printed on these vouchers secret. They are worth a lot of money. Google '50 BTC to USD' to have an idea".
Then I would move on to explaining that there are exchanges that convert it to fiat if she wants to. Then the process of installing a wallet software, sweeping the funds and security. To wait a few days or weeks, so she's calm and recovered from the loss, and to call a friend or relative with whom she would trust that amount of money, if it's still too confusing for her.

I read the other day, about some very interesting strategies to avoid orphaning of blocks and losing time/money, called "SPV mining", I it could be what's happening here
It was something like, after receiving news that a block was discovered, a miner would start mining an empty block referencing the received one. Since the miner still didn't know what transactions were included in the received block, to avoid adding a transaction twice, the block would have to be empty until he validated and excluded the transactions from the mempool
@_date: 2016-07-03 04:49:41
Exactly. Just for how much attention and press that he managed to stir, he is definitely part of bitcoin's history. Just not as its creator, as far as we know.
@_date: 2016-07-05 01:51:08
To me your message uses a whole roundabout way to explain what a blockchain is, then finally, for the most important parts, you say "just Google it", when it should have been the opposite.
@_date: 2016-07-08 01:21:17
It doesn't really matter what price it will be exactly, everything always reaches a balance. In my view the 3 major pillars are mining difficulty, hashrate and price. Any outside factor that changes one of the pillars, will cause the other two to seek a new point where everything is balanced and keep going. 
Reward halving may cause hashrate to go down, which causes difficulty to lower. A price hike may cause hashrate to go up, and difficulty also and so on. The parameters are always dancing with each other, self correcting and keeping the system going.
@_date: 2016-07-09 02:16:50
I'm still a noob, but if I understand correctly, the hash is based on the previous block's hash, the nonce and the merkle root of the transactions (and probably something else that I can't remember). The coinbase transaction is a transaction, so there is something to create a merkle tree from. Even if there were zero transactions, there is still stuff there that you could calculate a hash with (not saying that the block would be valid, though)
@_date: 2016-05-20 12:40:14
Thanks a lot! Honestly I if it wasn't for your complaint, I don't think I would be indignated enough to look for a solution.
