I am actually not affiliated with ACINQ at all. Maybe try their support.

You can also use Bitcoin core.

If you want to spend your money later using the lighting network opening a channel with you will still make a lot of sense. Especially if your employer is using a payment provider to pay you your salary. This way the payment provider can have many channels with thousands of people and collect some fees for routing your payments. If those fees are higher than 2 on-chain transactions then it will make sense to open the channel, let you make purchases and then close it as soon is all or most of the balance is on their side. Although if your payment comes in every month then leaving it open will be the right strategy, since the payment provider can collect fees and only has the cost of having the funds locked op in a channel (but since since most of it will be on your side most of the time this will not be much).

Try 1ml.com it has even better statistics imo.

You can use zapconnect -j to show a string that you can copy into your phone. Just type it in the terminal. Are you getting any error message?
@_date: 2018-09-02 18:36:57
You also want to close a channel if your Counterparty went offline for a long time and you can’t use the channel. That way you can get your money back and open a new channel with someone that provides more liquidity.

It’s true that this wouldn’t make much sense, so in this case a normal on-chain transaction would be better. 5,000$ doesn’t really classify as a micropayment. Although if you expect to make some payments later to spend your 5,000$ it might still make sense to leave it open so you can pay others.

Are you Craig Wright?

Electrum also supports it.
Also we are at about 50% segwit adoption now, someone has to use bech32. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 20:03:10
You should be able to send it to any wallet you like. If your version of Electrum does not support Segwit yet you can just upgrade it. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 23:36:51
Maybe it’s a windows thing. It seems like it doesn’t recognise -j as part of a command.

In Lightning 1.1 there will be dual funded channels which means both people can put funds in the channel when it is opened. This way the channel will be balanced from the start. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 07:24:53
He probably means with investors but you’re of course right. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 11:02:29
The good thing is that it is a lot harder to track you through the lightning network. So not really a problem since they can’t know who made the payment. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 14:43:12
Depends on how many connections you have. Could be way more than 8.
@_date: 2019-03-08 10:48:57
Bitcoin supports IPv6 so as long as you can forward your traffic to port 8333 to your bitcoin machine it should be no problem. If that doesn’t work you can also use tor. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 16:57:45
This list also doesn’t include tor nodes. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 22:21:11
I think you got the concept mixed up. 8 nodes are sending stuff to you but you are sending stuff to 110 nodes. That’s why the difference is so large. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 17:10:02
You can head over to lightningnetworkstores.com for a more comprehensive list of stores that support ln.

The audio quality is ok imo. Didn’t have any problems. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 06:24:11
Easiest way is to just send it to an address generated by your ledger. If your paper wallet is based on seed words you can also use those for your ledger but I would not recommend that. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 21:42:47
In theory you can send it directly to a miner. Also it is not guaranteed that your earlier transaction already reached all the miners. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 17:49:47
Telling your peers about open channels so they can find them and make payments. Makes the system a bit more robust. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 07:58:30
Yes exactly. Without being able to connect to peers you could not open new channels with them.

Check out the „Mastering Bitcoin“ book. It explains everything you need to know and is available to read for free online. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 20:53:00
Just use Bitcoin core and a python script or something. Can be done pretty easily.

Only if it becomes profitable again for them will they turn their rigs back on.

Yes, LN big opened a channel with basically everyone on the lightening network during the last week.

There are different tweets out there by different people. There is also a podcast episode by Stefan Livera where he talks about this. But bottom line: not worth it atm for the risk you are taking. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:06:05
Don’t forget that this is a hot wallet. If you put a lot of money in it there is a significant risk of theft, especially since the software is still in beta.

r/btc is a BCH subreddit 
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:27:13
If the price was so low it wouldn’t make sense to 51% attack it. The fact that BCH has not been attacked yet should be proof enough of that. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 11:43:16
According to Alex Bosworth it’s something like 0.1% annualised. And he has one of the biggest nodes. But that is just for now maybe if the number of transactions explodes it will get better.

So you installed Bitcoin-qt?
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:36:11
Are you launching bitcoind with parameters?
@_date: 2018-12-01 12:21:43
One downside right now is that you always need to be online if you want to be sure that your funds do not get stolen, unless you only want to send money and not receive it. Also routing is not very efficient yet so it can be slow and fail. Also it’s a hot wallet so risk of theft is higher. 
But all things considered it’s a great technology that will only get better over time and is already working quite nicely for its age. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 14:53:12
Join the lnd slack channel, there will always be helpful people on there.

Take a look at github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd to install the most used lightning implementation. The have detailed installation instructions. Once you have lnd up and running you can install the zap wallet and connect it to your lnd node. Zap has detailed instructions on that as well.
