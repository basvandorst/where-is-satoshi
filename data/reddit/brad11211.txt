I chose the name Sik Sisters becuase silk is one of the few handicrafts that women have in Cambodia. Sisters refers to the relationship between us as people and our Cambodia "Silk Sisters"

I should probably clarify.

Blog posts are akin to water cooler chat by comparison to patents..
To add to that, his blog posts are what 3 years old now? or more? From a time that would have been hectic for his life. Massive media attention on top of the Tax Man giving him a hard time.
What you're effectively doing, is taking a tiny (insignificant) subset of his past, and using it as a blanket claim for his entire existence.
To deny this mans clear intelligence, SN or not, is a poor judge of character. The patents are in depth and subject to peer review.. Not redditor review, or blockstream, but review by actual peers at the level required to validate the application.
Love him or Hate him, or completely not give a shit. Does not change the fact he is clearly intelligent. And probably more so than most of us.

Your first mistake is thinking they need/want investors.

Have you actually taken the time to read the patent applications?
I suspect your claim of gibberish is more from your lack of understanding...

The difference with BCH, is that if/when it becomes the largest and most worked chain. It "is" Bitcoin. And the segwit version becomes the altcoin..(maybe not politically, but as far as blockchain tech goes "the longest chain is the main chain") Litcoin could take over bitcoin in value 1000 times and it's still litecoin not bitcoin.

Yea,seems its not worth the time.

Not trying to take bitcointalks user base. But as in interim solution I could set up a forum if there is demand there in a very short time frame, as Im sure many others could. 
I wouldn't go to the effort how ever if its not wanted

This is very true, but they don't seem to be
