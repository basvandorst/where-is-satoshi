It’s very easy to have this point of view, especially if you were still living with your parents during the last financial recession. I implore you to ask any economist their opinions on the stability of the global economy in the coming years. Might make an alternative means of storing your wealth more appealing. Just a thought.

Weird, I thought Coindesk was a website not a single source of truth for an infinite variable of factors that can impact an decentralized market.
In all seriousness though, significant gains are rarely made in a week, it’s possible, but shouldn’t be sought after or expected. To add comfort for comfort, just a few years ago folks felt exactly like you do now, and they are still in the green despite this past dump.
Let the force be with you, not Coindesk.

You should familiarize yourself with capital gains and losses. It is 100% a taxable event, thus can claim up to 3k per year (cap) in losses according to the IRS.

I know, sorry. More addressed to those who do.

I’m guessing you never had to worry about financial stability either.

Rules defined on consensus of peers... not by a single exchange, and especially not by Roger and Jihan.

It isn’t supposed to be an apples to apples comparison with the current financial processes you have grown accustomed to. You don’t put your money “into” bitcoin without taking some personal responsibility. Allowing a third party to handle your private keys is equivalent to putting your money in someone else’s bank account. Educate before you hate young Padawan.
