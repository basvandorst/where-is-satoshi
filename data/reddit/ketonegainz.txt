Card failures cost time, and in mining time is money. The fans may get worn and need replacement, but the cards themselves undergo very little thermal fluctuations like typical gaming GPUs see. I'm fine with buying miners cards.

Glass-Steagall was effectively gutted under the clinton admin which is what directly led to the explosion of derivatives and the near crash of 2008/9

I'm in the same boat, although I thought it would be cleared from the mempool in 2 week, I guess not? Scary.

I didn't watch the clip, but basically whatever Cramer says, you're best off doing the opposite, lol

Whew, you had me even more worried! glad its not Bittrex, but it still looks like there is no real safe place to trade.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:31:58
Do you have a source for this? This is the first time I'm hearing of that!
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:04:43
SCAM! That website instantly spun my CPU up to full usage. I'd bet its mining with the machines that visit that site.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:23:19
Is this some sort of a joke? If no, source?
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:48:05
That's quite a statement. Evidence?

Another little known fact, he froze himself!

Hmm... sure, why not get it started. Sent .002BTC to you. Seems kinda silly with fees being what they are, but oh well :)

We might need to add an additional "?" to the "# weeks to new highs".

I just checked my account ant I was hit by this. Multiple copies of my weekly autobuys!! Drained my account! Anyone have any luck getting this resolved!?!
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:20:08
No, Visa debit. Looks like I'll be visiting my bank on Monday :/

If you buy something there with BTC and ever need a refund, you won't get it, you will just get newegg store credit. They messed up an order for me and I was SOL.
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:47:26
Possibly. Last summer my father was entertaining the idea of purchasing a good amount of BTC, but he's not very tech savvy, so I was considering just having him transfer the cash to me, then sending the BTC to his wallet. I eventually decided against it, but I was almost in the same position as this guy.

You need an additional sheet outlining punishments for putting dumbass extraneous apostrophes in "Burpees".

Did you draw that chart yourself? lol

How much bandwidth does this use? I've got a shitty ISP with great speeds but a monthly data cap :/
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:16:57
Ahh, ok, thanks for the info. Yeah, getting Core up to speed took about 100G, looks like I'll have to hold off on running a node until I have a connection with a cap larger than 400G
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:08:08
Yep. How much data up and down will this go through in a month?
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:44:42
Oh.... this is profitable again? I ran a 5mhash rig with 6 AMD cards in 2014, but I thought the difficulty put anything but ASICs out of business? I shut mine down and sold of most of the cards when it cost more in electricity than I could get back in coinage.
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:50:13
gdax and chill?

Well this ended up being a giant marketing fail. They can't even answer questions about their product on their own post. Here's your sneak peak at the amount of communication you're going to get if you spend money with these guys.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:14:35
I messaged an old buddy who also mined around 2013/2014 and he said that there are some coins based on things like X11 that aren't mineable with ASICs. Also, maybe video cards are waaay way faster as well? I don't miss the days of trying to snipe AMD video cards from any source possible, hah!
Looks like my old rig would still be in the red -
