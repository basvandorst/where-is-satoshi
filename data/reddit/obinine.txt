Bitcoin's [volatility continues to decrease]( If it stabilises at 0 then no one will be using it. However if/when it stabilises at 1000, 10000 or 100000 there's no reason not to denominate in it.

For the first 4 years of bitcoin's existence they were created at the rate of 50XBT roughly every 10 minutes. That ended at the end of November last year when the 'reward' (rate of creation) was halved to 25XBT roughly every 10 minutes. The next halving with occur sometime in 2016 wherein the reward will drop to 12.5XBT approximately every 10 minutes.... and so on.

Technically fiat means "by decree" - usually of a sovereign power (ie. king, state, etc.) By that definition bitcoin is not fiat and that's the definition that you will see used most within the bitcoin community. However I suppose you could stretch fiat to mean "by the decree of mathematical proof" by which bitcoin would quality as fiat. Most bitcoiners don't use that definition but still happily believe that bitcoin is at the decree of math and phsyics.

This is a great converstation to be having.

There are currently 2 - proxywallet and brainwallet. They are virtually identical, right down to a lack of support for scanning QR codes. Other than that they are perfectly capable of receiving, storing and sending Bitcoin (with the nasty caveat that you have to *manually* enter the address that you are sending to).

I don't have a problem, in principle, with an organization that charges me a small fee to securely hold my bitcoins. Not saying that I would avail myself of such a service but I know many who would. Having a bank step forward and offer such a service would be a major coup for bitcoin. I suspect it will happen (and probably sooner rather than later) but I think it will probably happen in a banking haven like the Caymens or Switzerland, or some place that is seeking to quickly innovate and revitalize its banking industry like Iceland or Ireland before it arrives on my shores (Canada). Our banks are notoriously conservative.

It's not Gavin's job to be hard and decisive. He's a great leader for the project because he's a calm voice of reason and gets along with pretty much everyone.

Yes  you can access a citrix session with Linux. Unfortunately you have to use a proprietary client to do it :(

Hey, some of use came to cypherpunk via cyberpunk. Important distinction nonetheless.

If you file a police report at least you have that as evidence which would be better than nothing.
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:01:45
No. The best that thing that you can do it to hold both views simultaneously.

And if you deleted your Facebook account long ago and your girlfriend is a lawyer who spends all her non-working hours at the gym?

I did a side-by-side comparison of my Asus Zenbook with the Mac Book Air when I bought last year. They had nearly the same form factor, exact same CPUs, RAM and SSDs. The screen on the Asus was matte (which I much prefer) and much higher resolution. The MBA was $200 more.
@_date: 2013-02-18 18:41:05
Agreed - if they don't have it already then they probably will never. I'm thinking about some of the early adopters with big mining setups like Vladimir and Artforz.
@_date: 2013-11-05 23:48:54
That dog accepts bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-03-26 19:44:39
For sure!
@_date: 2013-09-16 17:06:19
I love what you are doing but as someone into health and nutrition I can't say I'm very impressed at all with what I see there (except for the apple).
@_date: 2013-09-02 18:58:15
I just tried it but it just keeps crashing (N4 PA). Is it using the data from coinmap.org?
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:24:49
I would be worried if it wasn't obvious that it represents $500M that mostly belongs to cyber-crypto-anarchists.
And that's exactly the inflow of wealth that the world could use right now.

I predict that within 5 years the FEC will mandate that ALL political contributions must come though a single bitcoin address for each separate political entity. That way we can all see the funds flow in real time.
@_date: 2013-10-01 20:09:24
That's pretty much me, alrighty.
@_date: 2013-08-03 03:49:20
Cool, thanks! How would I find that link (it didn't come up on a search or maybe I just don't understand how the site works?) Btw. PeaceGeeks International is a registered Canadian charity.
@_date: 2013-09-07 23:50:50
You're most welcome! I'm super stoked to be able to support fresh programming talent in this way. A couple of other UX enhancements you may consider:
1.  Having the list of nearby venues in a 'swipe from the left' pane. I noticed that Google is really going this way with their apps.
2. Having the list come up in individual 'cards' for each venue. Again this seems to be the direction that Google apps are going  in terms of UI.
3. Perhaps doing a check when the app is started to see if there are any updates to the database so you'd know if you needed to download it again.
Just some ideas that you may want to play with!

Yesterday when I was there the line up was a mixture of grandmothers, mothers with babies, and IETF attendees (the annual conference was here this week) all looking to buy their first bitcoins.

Be sure you have cookies enabled. If I re-call correctly the hand-off between Interac and VanCity involves a cookie. Other than that I would hold fast because it smells to me like you risk getting scammed.
@_date: 2013-01-30 02:04:18
[Here]( just the article on bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-25 18:57:24
Me too.
@_date: 2013-09-05 20:42:37
I met the (co)founder of Indiegogo at an event last month and I asked him when I could expect to see bitcoin support. He said "when PayPal accepts it".
So... I wouldn't hold my breath...
@_date: 2013-04-05 01:12:45
Thank you! Great work.
@_date: 2013-05-01 15:38:24
Well if you subscribe to [this model of investment bubbles]( then the price has yet to return to the mean.
@_date: 2013-06-23 16:53:16
Well at least we're definitely finally into the "then they fight you" stage.

The first video on  no longer exists, fwiw.

It's worth noting that p2pool's luck for the past while has been:
* 7 days: **172.8%**
* 30 days: **113.6%**
* 90 days: **111.8%**
_([luck charts here](
And that any fees you pay to the developer of the software are voluntary (ie. no mandatory pool fees).

I'll be in Parksville in 2 weeks. I'll come looking for you. Great job.

To be fair it should be shooting through Chinese Yuan milestones as that's what driving most of the increase since the beginning of October.

If you're running Paranoid Android (and numerous other ROMs) you can set the width and height of any widget.
@_date: 2013-02-14 23:16:11
Already got mine. Thanks for adding the option!
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:44:50
How does one prove that?
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:46:40
Agreed. I've been using them with success for several years.
@_date: 2013-10-03 00:01:22
Apparently they are required to auction them. That will be very interesting. My money's on the Winklevii buying them and donating them to charity.
@_date: 2013-02-18 18:46:15
Heh... I'm definitely not like most people :-)

I think the point it we don't actually have helium in our atmosphere. Its mined deep in the ground and leaves the planet at the first opportunity.

It's a bounty not a contract ;-)
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:43:38
For those considering accepting donations of bitcoin there is a nice little widget for your site [here](
@_date: 2013-09-03 00:09:52
Yep it works now. Thanks. Unfortunately it doesn't qualify for my bounty as it doesn't give me a filterable list of the closest establishments, isn't using coinmap.org for its data source, and isn't available in the F-Droid repository.
I would really recommend switching your data source to a crowdsourced model. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 18:26:21
Let's hope that is just the code-name for the project.
@_date: 2013-09-02 16:43:56
Yes, this is not super complicated. First one to get it into both app stores wins the prize! ;-)
@_date: 2013-02-09 00:57:59
Hey, how can I get a listing for [PeaceGeeks]( on your site? Keep up the great work, btw!
@_date: 2013-10-04 00:41:55
Interesting, thanks.
@_date: 2013-01-06 14:45:29
Yep, that would work for me.
@_date: 2013-01-30 03:48:34
tip away ;-)
@_date: 2013-02-04 21:16:49
It's probably the Avalon ASIC folks cashing in.
@_date: 2013-08-18 02:01:15
At that point there stops being any appreciable block reward save the transaction fees contained in the block.
@_date: 2013-10-03 22:44:52
How long ago was that? There has been a lot of work on stratum support in p2pool recently.
@_date: 2013-03-01 20:40:27
Nice! I just wrapped up 2 years at 3GH. Waiting for my ASICs to arrive now.
