He's a pretty good public speaker, not as good as a real pro like Andreas Antonopoulos but he's still a lot better at it than most programmers. His background is actually fine art, not science or engineering, and he often says that's where he learned about PR and politics.
As for the dislike, he often rubs people the wrong way because he very frequently calls out people publicly for what he considers bad ideas and broken code, but he himself hasn't contributed much. He's also gotten flack for being perceived to take credit for others ideas, such as "his" CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode that was actually invented and initially implemented by Gregory Maxwell. (and the most recent implementation is by Pieter Wuille, not Todd) He does credit people deep in the documentation/comments, but given how much he's focused on PR when others are busy writing code I'm not surprised it gets people angry; the public sees him rather than the much larger team that dis the actual work.
Another big dislike is how most (nearly all?) of his clients are actually altcoins. Adam Back/Gregory Maxwell have brought this up multiple times about his, using the term "scamcoin" to talk about those clients. He's also done work for big banks like Barclay's, which isn't a surefire way to win friends in this space...
Lots more too, but the above is what I'm most familiar with.

He sure is a bifurcated character:

FWIW other devs like Gavin, as well as the Bitcoin Foundation, (lol) don't consider him to be a "core dev" even though he gets called that a lot. The Bitcoin Foundation even tried to correct Coindesk on that point. Probably not the smartest thing to try to do given the reddit pitchfork crowd, but I can see their point.
