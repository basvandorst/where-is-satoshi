You'd be wise to get out before it hits double digits, yes. You need to learn to stay away from where all they do is preach how it can only go up. Never is any criticism allowed here which is where you get the false sense this is going up still.

Holy shit you're literally a 12 year old.

If you didn't have the reading comprehension of a literal 12 year old, you'd realize my statement was about people issuing a chargeback when a merchant is being uncooperative, as in has a shitty return policy.

Not right away. It'll die a slow death. And no, not solely based on this.

Based on the fact that it's been on a slow decline ever since the speculative bubble that spiked the price to $1200, even with major retailers accepting it.
Based on that it'll never be a real currency with mainstream acceptance, but it could possibly be a payment processor, and if it becomes a payment processor, it doesn't matter what the price of bitcoin is because it'll work the same way.
Based on the fact that it doesn't scale well for mainstream usage.
Based on the fact that... y'know what, why don't you go read some critics of bitcoin instead of lapping up all the shit that spews?
Also, it hasn't even see regulation yet, just wait and see what happens when it does.

It's hilarious that you delusional fucks think people just go around reversing all their transactions all day long.
In reality it happens maybe once every 5 years with an uncooperative merchant.
