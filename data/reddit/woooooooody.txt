It was a rhetorical question.

Do you invest in things you have no idea about?

Why even take out a loan then?

How does this even happen? Don't you have backups of backups of backups, stored and multiple locations?

Just bought $20000 of bch. Everything I buy the price spirals downwards, hopefully triggering btc back up.

His post is also much like roulette. He'll be wrong, or right

I went here a couple of years ago. You could insert cash in to a machine, and it would print you a wallet with your new btc. Then you could go buy a coffee

that would never happen, if it did, people would be buying 100s of coins each

So you think that people can bet that the price will rise, but those who have the opposite opinion can't participate? Seems unfair

So a farmer can't open shorts on his crops for insurance against having a bad season? Do you know what you're talking about or just pretending?

Yes it says up in the top left, bitfinex. You can go on tradingview.com - type in BTCUSD and then you can view data from a few different exchanges

What about all the people that short their own company in case they have a bad season? Your method of only allowing longs would destroy a lot of legit businesses.
