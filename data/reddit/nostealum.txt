Not true. Most safes don't contain any insulation. Metal box. Thousands of degrees of heat. Paperwork inside go poof.

I'm a big fan of one coin. It's important to relieve fools of their funds before they cause any more trouble with them. 
By putting that crazy woman on the video I think they are doing a fine job of excluding any reasonably intelligent person from the attack.
Big fan.

Cool. I'm hopeful that this will be true for lots of people, but I must admit I'm a little skeptical that you negotiated you rent payment in btc.

Well I suppose if there is a group of people that do most of their trading on the darker I would agree. My guess is that these folks do 100+ transactions in government paper to 1 in btc.

I think the chart is nonsense. Bubbles are created by foolish or deceived (as in the case of fed printing money) buyers. 
Smart investors buy an asset because they know it is more valuable than the current market price.
Trying to predict future price changes based on historical prices alone (and maybe a chart such as this) will not give you better results than random purchases.

Ok, but that is a different use of the word money than Austrians would use. And that is why they are confused about bitcoins existence (I think). It really is just a word game, but an important one.

It's a new asset. And it is very new and cool, but money is the primary medium of exchange. It's not that today. There is a Satoshi post somewhere where he says the same thing, but "money" has a meaning and ignoring that makes it confusing (especially for new people).

But do you switch to government paper before you trade with someone else? If so you are using bitcoin like an asset, but not as a primary medium of exchange.

He does agree it makes sense for financial transactions in countries with a central government that can't be trusted (but I'm guessing his list of those is a bit shorter than mine).

Oh, I'm not saying it's not possible for it to become money. But I am saying that (at least with the definition of the word money used by Austrian econ guys) it's not mo hey yet. 
When you go to the grocery store do you convert prices to btc to know how expensive something is? If not, that's a good indication it's not money (your primary medium of exchange) yet. Do most of the people you buy from list prices in btc? That's another indicator.
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:27:34
Totally. And as a new asset it became valuable due to its properties (like any other asset) so the Austrian economists shouldn't be so confused about its existence.
I think the real trouble for those guys is being comfortable that digital assets exist at all.

Yes, there are lots of things (like the lightning network) planned to make transaction fees lower and speeds faster, but transaction fees are also part of the design of bitcoin. Everything is going very well as far as I can tell.

They probably tax other things as well. But it doesn't make it the primary medium of exchange in Holland.

We will sit in the room where the federal reserve scam was conceived!

I don't see any evidence that Bitcoin isn't heading in the right direction and has been redirected to fail. A hard hark would be the solution if it did happen.
The block size debate still seems very healthy and I think everyone agrees progress is being made to improve the system. There is some disagreement on path a, b, c vs path c, a, b but that is fairly minor in the big scheme of things (in any software project).

Had no concept of this before. Thanks!

Confirmation from one of the more informed technical folks that such a doc doesn't exist would be awesome too.

This is a good thing for two reasons:
1. It will encourage users and wallets to use the privacy measures available (such as unique keys for each transaction).
2. The bitcoin developers will see the vulnerabilities and respond (as needed). Governments find vulnerabilities and keep them for use.
