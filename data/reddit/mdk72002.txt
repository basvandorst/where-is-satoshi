I dont think it has been long enough to notice any type of drop in volatility. Bitcoin was at 17K last Saturday and went to 12 something. Futures have been out for a few weeks. That is still pretty volatile.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:16:02
I can see it now. Tether subpoena results show that they do indeed have the money to cover all outstanding tether. Bitcoin stays down anyway. Good news does almost nothing nowadays.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:31:40
There is a MASSIVE difference between what happened on 9/11 and a nuclear strike. That being said it would not surprise me at all if people reacted by buying or selling. My comment was meant to show how ridiculous people are rather than make fun of you. There would probably still be traders in the walking dead waiting to get their trades confirmed. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:14:07
Lol omg the USA was hit with a nuclear weapon I better buy bitcoin!!!! Meanwhile the sun is also going down, better drink my own piss.

too many new money indeed.

How about in the last minute? See how easy it is to pick an arbitrary range? Does not really take a genius to know that the larger the dataset the more accurate the prediction. Larger data sets show bitcoin rising. I'd you don't thinknit will then just short it and get crushed or get rich.

@_date: 2018-01-22 20:56:35

I am actually a former stock broker. In all of my previous posts I said exactly this. They must be buying actual bitcoin as a hedge and then dumping it when they liquidate their contracts.
Based on the volatility it would be great if we could trade options. Straddles specifically. Can you straddle trade with futures? I have super limited knowledge on futures but seems like you can.

"Can someone explain this to me? I put in 1,000 in my Coinbase account I put it in ETH it goes down to 750 which is now in my account. But I still have 1,750 in my account. 750 ETH 1,000 USD.?"

If you are using the statistical definition of probability then you would be correct. However, since there are sometimes many definitions for a word then these would apply :
1) the quality or fact of being probable.
2) a strong likelihood or chance of something

No. You are claiming that bitcoin cash is the "real" bitcoin and are trying to rename Bitcoin to "bitcoin core". Nice try.
Bitcoin is acting as a digital gold right now. It will be used as a currency when second layer solutions are ready. Bcash would have the same exact problems if they had anywhere near the same level of transactions. Either by backlog or by centralized nodes required to load a huge blockchain. First you have to have scale to having scaling problems.

I dont know what you having a hard time undwrstanding. The guy specificalloy said to look at a 3 month chart to prove his point that price has been falling. A three month chart does not support his position at all. I seriously dont know how thats hard for you to grasp. The price of Bitcoin is fucking higher than it was 3 month ago which means it's NOT consistently falling as suggested.

@_date: 2018-01-16 19:16:36
I have a very clear understanding of our monetary system and fiats place in it. The world is in need of a global currency and Bitcoin can be that currency without being controlled by any centralized authority that has shown time and time again that it cannot be trusted as such. Are you alright with what big banks did to the economy and who had to pay for it? Is it alright with you that as of now you can be told what you can and cannot do with your own funds? Where you can send them and how much you are allowed to send? If you actually desire freedom you would respect Bitcoin for giving it to you.
I don't blame you for feeling how you do about Bitcoin. Spending a career in investment banking pretty much forces you to think that Fiat is bulletproof. Everything that CAN be revolutionized WILL be revolutionized and currency is next in line. 
EDIT: Also lets not forget that many times in the past major currency changes have taken place. Getting off the Gold standard and it becoming illegal to own a lot of Gold for example. Change always comes with incredibly resistance.
@_date: 2018-01-27 04:55:59

@_date: 2018-01-17 17:38:29
I dont think anybody knows how much is available vs how much is locked away. I dont think it really matters. The price is driven by who wants to buy vs who wants to sell. If there was only one bitcoin in existence it would be the same thing. The only thing you could argue is that people have a psychological reason to want to own one whole bitcoin or more.

Fundamentally Bitcoin is the very first technology to solve the double spending problem which now makes it possible to have a digital currency. Sure you can apply the same thing to other currencies now but if its that simple why don't you just build another Facebook?
There is no balance sheet or product being produced by Bitcoin. So what? Is your argument that Gold produces a product other than itself, or the American Dollar? Oh yes the Dollar is based on the faith of the federal government. The same government that allowed banks (most likely like the one you work for) destroy the economy, borrow money from tax payers and then lend it back to the tax payer at interest, and actually become BIGGER banks as a result of the crisis rather than break them up. I dont have faith in our monetary system. Not when the fed allows that kind of shit to happen and when you can print as much money as you want at any time. Bitcoins FUNDAMENTAL value is being apart from that system.

@_date: 2018-01-13 23:58:28
I don't know. There are tons of possibilities. People confused as to what they are buying, people now being able to access it through the biggest exchange, Etc. Does not make it a better coin. Bcash took the easiest route to scaling rather than the longer, more complex, and long term decentralized route. Increasing the block size is incredible simple building the lightning network is incredibly labor intensive. Research both and if you are honest and have a brain it would be clear which has the most probable positive long term outcome.

Correct but you are the one making predictions and using the last month as the proof. Literally every other time it has recovered.

I see what you are saying now. I dont know if people buying right now are planning to hold or just plan to quick sell when it gets to a certain threshold. I really dont think there are a TON of people that look at Bitcoin as an incredible technology vs a get rich quick scheme.

@_date: 2018-01-17 19:11:26
It works in both directions. You buy a futures contract going short. If you buy actual Bitcoin now if the price goes up instead of down you have a hedge on your short position. Its similar to an options straddle. You are counting on volatility.

True and False. No BTC trades hands on the contract itself but without a doubt people bought and sold Bitcoin as a hedge on their contracts. Literally EVERY single time futures liquidate the price drops hundreds of dollars instantly. Liquidations are tied to dumping of actual coins.

The problem is that the masses aren't really that smart and are not going to build important safeguards. Roger ver is an example. He thinks that insider trading isn't a crime. Without that safeguard the divide between rich and poor would be 1000x worse. Currency has safeguards as well, mechanisms to curb inflation for example.

It depends on who you are asking about. The processor makes a small cut, the card brands make a small cut, and the platform makes a small cut. Each earn about 10 basis points. The bulk of the income goes back to the bank that issued the credit card. It's called interchange and every card has a different interchange rate attached to it.

Sure. That is an incredibly dangerous game to play. First of all they violate SEC rules considering futures are regulated. They also have to buy or sell bitcoin in large amounts to influence the price for contracts they are already long or short on in the futures market.

I am a hodler
I think that just telling people to hodl no matter what is foolish. A lot of the sentiment on this sub seems to be that way. Truth is most people bought with the intent to make money tomorrow. I dont think Hodlers care much about these guys since they wont be in the market long anyway.
If you bought bitcoin and sold when it went down within a week of buying then you are trying to be a trader and not an investor. Professional trades are not all that much better than regular guys in my opinion. If you try to trade and lose your money then you should have never bought in the first place. Learn about what you are buying and decide if you like the company/product/crypto/service rather than going with what everybody else is doing.

Seriously though the whole "its a bubble" now its a "dead cat bounce" etc... are all complete bullshit. Nobody has a clue.

I disagree completely. Most people still don't know what bitcoin is so phrasing it as if it's a threat would get more attention. If he explains the blockchain incorrectly most people would not even know and you would only be proving it to people fhatvalready know he's gullnof shit.

Why is this a surprise? Coinbase handeled the Bitcoin Trash listing like complete assholes that had no idea what they were doing. Didn't allow you to trade your BCH for BTC directly because of "liquidity issues". They were protecting a shit coin and will most likely continue to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:39:37
BCH was launched on GDAX and Coinbase with very little notice. Not only that, but they did not even bother to establish liquidity and when liquidity ran out they cancelled and cleared the order book. THEN started up the next day with a post only order book to establish liquidity. A few people bought at the height of that craze at over 9K per BCH.
Coinbase has had an influx of users that they are just not prepared to handle. Sometimes explosive growth kills a business. Not only are thousands of people waiting days to get an answer on a support ticket because of how understaffed they are but those same people now have to cope with the fact that they are using an exchange that will add more cryptos to their service BEFORE getting their service in good shape in the first place. There are three reasons in my mind why this would happen.
1) Manipulation- Coinbase desired to manipulate the price for whatever reason you could think of.
2) Incompetence- Really speaks for itself.
3) Insider Trading
I really feel that Incompetence is most likely.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:11:44
fails to convey the basic measure of faith that ever transaction since the dawn of man has stood on? In what regard? Faith in its valuation? Really that is all we are talking about here. Value only works when two people agree on the value of something. Words work the same way. We both agree on what a word means which is how we can communicate. They dont have any intrinsic meaning.
Bitcoin is still in the incredibly early stages of development. I am not sure how you can make the claim that it lacks sufficient backing. Its pretty much indestructible. Volatile? Sure. ANYTHINGS value would be super volatile before the free market and enough people eventually peg its value. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:52:40
So how much did your short? Unless you have a short position why would anybody even consider your statement when people have been sayoing it since bitcoin was $100? Short or gtfo.

It could be a bubble popping. It could be somebody stubbed his toe this morning and was angry enough to sell his bitcoin. It could be that nobody has a clue what the price will do and asking pointless questions just wastes server space.

You can regulate all you want but good luck forcing people to admit they hold a currency that has no central authority. I understand money laundering is an issue but

It is incredibly stupid to be keepin in line with the futures contracts but that is what happened on the cboe too. I guess people are buying and selling based on the futures because they can see how wall street feels about Bitcoin and just go with them.

I actually own a Merchant Processing ISO. 95% of my business is credit card processing. Buying a cup of coffee with a credit card is still a terrible option for a business. That is why they have minimums. Say you go into a Deli and buy a cup of coffee for $1.50 and use your Debit Card. The debit Interchange rate is .22 and .05% and you usually pay a 10 cent fee to process an authorization over the front end network. Ignoring the .05% because its tiny you still pay 32 cents to accept that card or 21% of the transaction. Credit cards are not good for micro transactions either. Better than Bitcoin for now but not for long.

Not a chance. You think that people are going to report their crypto holdings? If you dont hold your crypto on a public exchange there would be no way to enforce it and its pretty much a guarantee that most people would not report.

1) Multiply your .011337376 by 3
2) Now take that number (.034012128) and divided it by three
3) Now you should have .011337376 so now you use that to buy yourself a fucking math text book.

@_date: 2017-12-28 04:45:28
Sure. One of those reasons being that nobody else in the investment was calling it a bubble.
Of course it could still be a bubble anyway but time will tell. I think the real bubble is traditional banking. Its a technologically inferior product to Bitcoin. Especially from a consumer standpoint. Most people don't have to worry about whether or not their bank decides to let them use their money for whatever they want (banks close business bank accounts if they feel you are in a business that competes with them. I am an electronic payments ISO for example, or if you buy something they dont agree with).
Big banks destroyed the economy and the taxpayer foot the bill. Bitcoin has the potential to remove their control.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:17:38
According to Dr. Michael Burry (The big short) nobody actually knows they are in a Bubble which is why it becomes a bubble in the first place. That is why there are very few people that recognized it and made a lot of money during the mortgage crisis. 
Literally everybody is calling Bitcoin a bubble and people are still investing anyway. I would call that the very antithesis of a bubble.

I think a life sentence is fair for trying to have somebody killed. If somebody tried to have somebody I love killed I would want them dead by my own hands but since we live in a civil society I would want them to have their life taken from them through time like they tried to do with somebody else.

That problem is being worked on. The most obvious solution is not always the correct one such as an increase in the block size. The lightning network is a permanent mass adoption solution. Every other altcoin no matter their block size will face the same exact issues if they gain the volume in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:29:32

So how much have you shorted?
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:55:59
Nobody knows the answer to that. Its not the price that is bringing me to post this. Fact of the matter is that the Price is going to follow the utility. Nobody is going to pay more to transact in Bitcoin because they "believe in it" at least not for long. If LN does not deploy in the first quarter of 2018 Bitcoin will die.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:11:08
Why these facts matter are much more important. Everybody thinks they have an answer to a few important questions. Lets look at Expensive fees and slow transactions. Bcashers think raising the block size will fix this and it did in the short term. What happens if they reach mass adoption? Visa accounts for 65 THOUSAND transactions per second. Guess their blocks will have to get pretty damn big. They would face the same exact issues.
Lightning networks are an actual permanent solution to the problem. Ever think that maybe the most obvious solution (like increasing block size) isnt the correct one? Where do you stand on this?
All the other facts dont really mean much. Burden on environment? Sure but compare that to printing trillions of dollars in fiat. Not anonymous? So what? Neither are most of the other cryptos. No longer decentralized? How do you figure that?

Well either you are lying (I dont think you are) or the person you spoke to at your bank does not know what they are talking about and you need to ask for a manager to get an explanation. 
I for one should know considering that I own and operate a merchant processing company. There is no "holding" an authorization. I call you and say hey some guy wants to buy this thing and you say ok sounds good he has the money so ill put 200 bucks on hold but only for 24 hours. Here is an authorization code. You then use that authorization code to capture the funds within that window of time. The window of time depends on the bank that issued the card as I said before. If that window of time expires then the authorization code is no longer good (although it can still be captured but that is beyond the scope of this example).
Simplex in this instance literally cant remove an authorization. The auth is issued by the issuing bank and now has nothing at all to do with simplex. They only have the option to allow the auth to expire uncaptured or to capture the funds.

@_date: 2017-12-02 03:01:14
No. The reason you don't sound like you know what you are talking about is because being up 100% is an incredible return and almost never realistic. Wall street never gets those kinds of returns. If a broker could do that for his clients he would be the richest man trhat ever lived.

Buying something because you feel like it will increase in value is pretty much how the entire stock market works. There is a fine line between investing and speculation and I think that if you were to try and draw that line on Bitcoin you would also have to draw it for pretty much every equity in the market since most people are not buying stocks for any reason other than having a store of value in a blue chip or as an appreciating asset.
The only value anything has is what somebody is willing to pay for it. I dont see Bitcoin being any different. If anything Bitcoin actually has utility and extremely useful technology behind it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:20:37

False. I care about the Crypto movement. If you are going to buy XRP the only thing you are doing is taking a big one in the ass by a COMPANY that fucking owns it.
If you want to speculate in Ripple or any other shit coin you obviously have the freedom to do so. How about not talking shit in a  Bitcoin sub about those shit coins.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:54:00
lol rental fee
Shorting means you are taking possession of a security and selling it on the open market. You have to replace that security in the future as agreed upon and your hope is that the price drops and you can buy that security for cheaper than you sold it thus making the spread as profit. Mostly you just trade options or swaps rather than the actual security. There is no rental fee. Instead you usually buy the option out of the money meaning that you are already at a loss when you take possession so you need at least some upward of downward movement to make that money back depending on what the option is.
This is a simplified version of course. There is a lot to learn. For example selling a naked put means you are selling a contract to "put" the security to you at a price without having your own call option to "call" the security back to you on another contract as to hedge your bet. This gives you a downside loss equal to the strike price of the contract since it could theoretically go to zero. Selling a naked call gives you unlimited upside loss since there is no limit to how high a price can go. There are a ton of investment strategies with options and swaps. Straddels and Spreads being the popular options. Check out definitions if interested to learn more.

That isn't how credit cards work. You don't just release an authorization. The issuing bank authorizes a purchase along with a time limit on the authorization. 90% of issuers have a 48 hour auth limit where if the transaction was not captured the funds are released back in to your account. The business has no ability to give you back your money unless the transaction has been captured. Call your card issuer and ask them how long authorizations last on your specific card.

In all seriousness if a person needs to be told that their investment is risky on a Reddit forum 100 times in case they might have missed it in the other 500 posts then I would say they deserve to lose their money.

You are going to be mining at a loss. The only way it possibly makes sense is if you think bitcoin will rise in value after you acquire it and then as people have already said you may as well just buy it.

I didn't plan to respond to your last post.
The whole point was to say that people are turning this sub into something ridiculous. The guy was basically smack talking Bitcoin because he cant make 100% profit as fast as he could in Texas holdem according to him on $100 bucks. Then asked a super basic math question. This wasn't some young kid whom I am more than happy to help. I mean its a pretty ridiculous thing to make a post about. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:20:51
Sounds like you don't know what you are talking about. You know how birds just bird around? It's hard to explain. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:01:11
1) Totally agree with this. Its the same in the stock market. Some stocks can be super undervalued to the point that their liquid assets, sometimes even their cash reserves, are higher than their market cap.
2) Agreed. Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance. Bitcoin could potentially go to $0. I have money on it going back up though because I think that is more likely. If you investing in the price rather than the product then you should just keep your money in your piggy bank.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:05:44
Disagree completely. Becoming emotionally involved in a company is the only way you could ever hope to have it succeed. You cant just start selling a product or service unless you are emotionally tied to its success or failure or you will be pretty much guaranteed to fail.
With bitcoin the more people emotionally tied to it the better it will do. Bitcoin is a disrupting technology. I dont think anybody is trying to force it in a box where it does not belong. What do you think the Lightning network is being built to do? Proof of concept also?

Yes of course. He would never admit to anything of the sort though so he would be forced to defend his default position to the public. Point being while Bitcoin keeps going up the more you call it a fraud the more foolish you look. You can call it a bubble forever and never be proven wrong.

@_date: 2017-12-02 13:51:43
Nobody cares about you bank account value. Shitposting about bitcoin not being the "most efficient" way to double your money is ridiculous and makes you sound like a fool. If you know the most efficient way to make 100% gains you would be the richest man that has ever lived. You make some gains trading alts and you think that qualifies you as an expert in trading efficiency.

That isnt reasonable to assume at all. Adoption will not happen until the fee situation is taken care of. Lightning is working on that. Bcash thinks that just increasing the block size will solve this as if the easiest solution is the correct one which it may be but I highly doubt it.

Yeah? The blockchain takes a FUCK load of time as it is to sync. Increasing the blocks to 1GB wont hinder new players at all. You are absolutely right. Go back to the shitcoin you love so much and watch what happens.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:18:35
The futures are cash settled. They have nothing to do with actually buying or selling bitcoin. It would be ass backwards for a futures contract to tell bitcoin how to price itself and how much volatility it should have.

Absolutely fraud. Imagine if this were possible. You could just ACH 1MM to coinbase and if the price goes down you cancel and if the price goes up you just allow it to go through.
How retarded do people think coinbase is?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:48:58
Probably not. I mean exchanges are not really equipped to handle the type of volume they have been receiving lately so I can't imagine they have the resources to pay out on massive shorts if the market tanks. Especially since they aren't really regulated like a stock exchange.
My point in asking was really to see if you would indeed put your money where your beliefs are.

No dude. If a company can mine bitcoin and be profitable why would they rent that hash power out to people instead of just mining it themselves and selling it on an exchange right away? Companies sell mining power because they cant mine profitably but can rent out to people for profit.
Could also just be a ponzi or pyramid scheme like bitconnect is.

I am out. I am tired of this shit market. I have held since $100 BTC. Im done. Selling everything today. Good luck everybody.

On the right most column 11 - 18 down its a number multiplied by the same number (X) and the result always has the first number being multiplied by X as the last digit in the solution.
so Y * X = ?Y
P * X = ?P
V * X = ?V
Seems like that symbol is the key to the puzzle but I dont see what number would make sense. It must not be a whole number. 11 Would work but only when both numbers after the = are the same which they never are. These may not represent whole numbers and they do not have to. Only the cypher digits in the private key actually need to be whole numbers.

This market is trash

I actually own a legacy electronic payments company and deal mostly in processing credit cards. I cant even begin to explain to you just how complex the system is. Bitcoin wins by a VERY wide margin.
There are serious challenges though. Customers like rewards. Customers like the ability to chargeback. Merchants hate fees, merchants hate that a customer can chargeback. You have to ask yourself which one drives the market? The consumer or the merchant? I honestly do not know and im in the business.
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:19:16
You can decide just fine, after you have their permission and use their service, and pay their fees. /s
@_date: 2018-05-11 01:35:37
What? Less supply? What are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-05-23 02:06:04
For the third time. Find me somebody saying they lost money because of the manipulation and not their own choice. You keep attacking your own strawman argument.

Interesting story. I own a credit card processing company. I accidentally forgot my wallet at home with an empty tank of gas like a moron.
Anyway I went to three different gas stations figuring one of them will have Apple Pay so I could just use my phone. Not a single one of them could do it. Not even one. Think about that. EVERYBODY knows what apple pay is but nobody is using it. I wonder what this says about the eventuality of accepting Bitcoin for a business?
What we should all do is group together and target a business hardcore. Have it so that they get asked by different people all month if they accept Bitcoin. Then after a month of two have a guy offer to set them up to accept Bitcoin. Merchants are not going to Adopt otherwise.

@_date: 2018-05-22 16:42:06
Are you really that dense? You do know that there are laws against manipulation when it comes to trading assets be it stocks and bonds, currencies, commodities, or anything else?
Do you know whythose laws even exist? Painting the tape? Front Running? Pump and Dump? Insider Trading? Etc....
It is NOT even remotely the same as pricing a home below market value which is PUBLIC information.
Also I asked you a question you chose to ignore which is the crux of your entire post. Where did somebody claim that they lost money because of this manipulation and take no responsibility for it? Still waiting. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:18:42
yeah but that wont happen with banks because they are super trustworthy and would never do anything to hurt us /s

No he doesnt. He means less BTC. "I'm pretty sure the market is basing everything as if there are 21mil btc anyways"
Hes talking about the supply of bitcoin. He has no idea what hes talking about.

Just like I said. Its not as bad as bitcoin but not for long.

Merchants are starting to pass that fee on to their customers and offer cash discounts. Its catching on a lot in NY. Credit card terminals automatically add 4% fee.

What an idiotic post. Manipulation is obviously rampant in Bitcoin. Nobody is saying that others are responsible for their losses because of the manipulation. Show me one post where somebody claims this.

It's not only about ease of use. Credit cards offer rewards and chargeback security for the consumer. Merchant adoption is the most important goal and they are already pissed about paying 3% to accept cards.

You just cant manage to post anything here to support your narrative. No matter how much its asked of you. Now you want me to search a keyword in another sub to prove your point with no specific example.
This is what is wrong with the world.

The merchants have a problem with it. Thats the entire point. NOBODY is saying Credit cards are not easy to use. They are just VERY expensive to use and based on incredibly complicated systems build on a inflating dollar that robs you of value over time.

I fail to see where you provide anything even close to an explanation on how credit cards take days (plural) to confirm.

@_date: 2017-08-29 23:56:15
I am not sure what agreements they have. Visa and MasterCard and the others won't let you buy something that can be used as a currency for lots of reasons. Money laundering is one and the other is point acquisition. You buy bitcoins with a credit card to get sky miles or whatever other reward you may have and you sell the bitcoins and repeat.

I love how I get downvoted for posting a verifiable fact. It literally proves the point that he was making. I love bitcoin but not so much that I would ignore any valid point or question that people may call "negative". That is how science works along with business models. People are use to asking people close to them questions that already have the same opinions which is not helpful. Try to destroy bitcoin in your kind and if you can't do it then you invest.

Nah it's all good. It's not about everybody asking but so many people on this board claim to own so much bitcoin just to say they do. Doesn't matter if you have it or not. If you have 18 million of bitcoin and that's most of your worth I would advise moving some to hedge.

I own real estate as investments and disagree with just about everything you say. However, what other investment vehicles would you suggest where you can build long term wealth like in real estate?
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:37:33
Real estate is an income producing hard asset that never disappears.
Millions of people would disagree with you about real estate being one of the "worst" investments. If holding something with zero cost is your idea of a bad investment that would pretty much write off 95% of all businesses in the United States as bad investments.

This is great. Some cars have free power for the life of the car. You could just keep it plugged in at a supercharge station all the time and run bitcoin miners. Interesting loop hole but I LOVE tesla and it just seems like a fucked up thing to do to them. They have a mission just as noble as bitcoin and in the big picture is probably more important.

This^ 
morality is a construct used to exist as a society. This is why it's relatively easy to justify some of the most horrible things. For example you Rob the bitcoin to take care of the ones you love.
Trump was able to force people out of rent controlled apartments in Manhattan when he bought the building by allowing homeless people to move in for free. How amazing or horrible that move was depends on if you ask the person living in rent control or the homeless person.

They are probably down because jerk offs that want to sell are refreshing their screens 100s of times to see if their trades confirmed yet with no blocks for half an hour.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:41
There were no blocks mined for 45 mins. Then two in a row right away. I also noticed that as soon as those blocks were mined the price went up. As I type this another block was mined and I am watching the price increase. Looks like people are waiting to buy.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:48:06
You cant think of it like that. You can make that argument about any dick move. Its not so bad if I am the only guy doing it is not how you justify your dick move. I dont think its going to become a problem for Tesla in the long run of course but I its a problem none the less. That is the same thing as saying its alright to steal electricity as long as its from a multi billion dollar power company since they have so much of it.
It is pretty cool. The ingenuity of it at least. I find it pretty damn interesting. I am just saying that if somebody were to do this while using a super charge station they would be a super douche.

When your opinion is wrong almost every time it makes good sense for people to trade against you. You have been shown to be wrong consistently. Its a gift really.

Did anybody see that scumbag Ver is removing BTC as a default wallet on his website. (Not going to name it here).
This guy does nothing but deceive people into buy a shitcoin so that he can make money. Does nothing but talk about how "adoption is increasing" while they barely fill a 10th of a MB per block. Such a deceptive piece of shit.
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:49:43
Where did I say something even remotely like that? What a straw man. As I said, I actually own a large electronic payments company. I am more qualified to tell you about accepting credit cards then you are by about 15 years. Either accept what I'm saying and fact check it or live in whatever delusional world you want to. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:01:19

If head and shoulders pattern can be negated doesnt that make it a completely useless metric? Pretty much the same with all TAs
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:18:10
Yeah im not saying that you are a bad trader. All I am saying is that it seems you are making a definitive statement about a big dump incoming when in reality you have no idea if that will happen. When something becomes predictable and everybody starts trading on that information the opportunity is lost.
In the case of shorting every time you buy a short contract somebody sold it to you so obviously money will be made one way or another.

Price predictions are alright if there is ANY argument other than "I feel like it". With that said most of these morons only show up to tell you its going to go to X when its already on its way there and they are still wrong 99% of the time.

I agree and I posted the same thing.
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:46:22
Right. I stand by that statement. I dont believe in TA but lets say I did. Would that have prepared anybody against Mt Gox pumping the price or the trustee selling? Government regulation, Etc? I just want to point out that I did say "consistently".

I dont like seeing the price decrease but I am not really concerned from an investment point of view. Prices goes up and price goes down but the trend is clear. I invest based on long term trends not weekly or monthly ones.

@_date: 2018-02-01 22:32:24
Ohhhh shit you are right. Hey everybody the trick is to invest in something that performs better. You aren't even captain you are straight general fucking obvious. The point is you NEVER know what's going to perform. You INVEST in value not price.

Do you have any evidence to support that claim?
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:15:33

Don't get a hard dick yet 
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:47:08
I wish I could just grab people scream some sense into them but no matter how much you talk it just goes right through them. If you buy Bitcoin it should be for Investing long term. This is a long game not a "get rich now" game.
All you have to do is look at the mining industry. We are talking about an incredible amount of money in infrastructure at this point with very big players.

If you are an investor you invest in what you feel has value. Thats as simple as it gets. If you are a trader you care about price action short term. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:02:03
Completely incorrect. Difficulty adjusts. Miners do not control anything and even if they did Bitcoin still makes up the vast majority of hash power.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:17:49
If you are a trader you put in a stop loss. If you are an investor you care about the tech. The fundamentals do not change day to day and if you invest you should only care about the fundamentals. I hold a sizable position in Bitcoin and I am not selling nor do I have a stop loss in place.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:10:07
Opinions are like assholes I guess. The tech is revolutionary. Sure you are going to get people in the market that dont know their ass from their elbow. In the end the superior tech will prevail. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:43:16
I will tell you yet again. Your call about the price moving down WHILE its moving down is completely useless. Volume ALWAYS decreases on the weekend and historically every Sunday has been met with a drop in BTC price. Your "analysis" is bullshit. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:35:27
It's just that.... a guess. Based on nothing. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 02:00:39
Are you joking? Do you even know what the blockchain is dude? How it has very Little in common with what you posted?

This is false. You are allowed to give discounts for paying cash. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:35:46
I said the same thing. I am even the owner of a payment processor as my primary business and I am completely ok with this.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:44:19
Awesome job. I bet bitcoin is going down while it's going down. It's almost like you are psychic. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:49:51
The point is that its deception. His goal is literally to deceive people going to his website that do not know any better. Guy is a fucking joke. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:16:10
Who said anything about it destroying my financial stability lol. Are you assuming that my entire life is tied to it because I am willing to let my investment die with Bitcoin if it comes to it? Thats ridiculous.
It is black and white. You either want to make money on price swings and are a trader or want to invest long term because you believe in the tech. Short term trading isnt investing. Investing isnt trading. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:05:33
Yeah bro. This few hundred bucks proves its going to a million billion.

If only everybody followed this exact advice there would be no opportunity at all. You tell him not to listen to somebody just to make your own prediction based on nothing. Prove me wrong by providing your public address with 1k coins in it that you got from trading on these so called "opportunities".

Attempt to save face? I still said fuck off moron. Keep wishing bitcoin goes down so your desperate ass can buy a 10th of a coin. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:26:21
It's a loss if it's a loss. Not being a loss until you sell is just something guys say to feel better. What if Bitcoin went to zero and then you can't sell? You never lose Money?

@_date: 2018-03-09 20:28:07
Hey guys. I was just doing my usual Technical analysis and it looks like Bitcoin is going to go to $15,000. If its hits $15,000 it means we are going up. However, the TA also suggest that Bitcoin might go down to $1000. Otherwise it will go sideways.
This is how fucking retarded most of you TA guys sound.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:51:53
No. The dollar is a currency. So what? Its not even remotely comparable to bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-02-05 02:39:27
Actually judging by what you said it does. Bulls wont be impossible to find because people are bullish on bitcoin regardless of the price thus making the example non compliant with reality.

@_date: 2018-02-09 00:20:55
you forgot "dont invest more than you can afford to loose" Yes I know it says loose and not lose. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:15:38
I pointed out the word I used which was consistently. If a trader, especially in Bitcoin, could consistently use TA for gains then their profits would grow exponentially. What I said was you would be extremely lucky to do so which is a comment I stand by.
Most importantly though even if you could correlate the two perfectly it does not equal causation. If somebody that was an expert trader had lessons to teach about TA and showed consistent results id be the first one doing it. Problem with that is as soon as the lessons are taught the opportunities are lost when everybody starts doing them. My mind cant comprehend things that are not rooted in scientific modeling and therefor trading is not for me. Trading is based a lot on human emotions which I don't really understand no matter how many examples are presented to me.
@_date: 2018-03-04 02:49:33

Fine. If it's so predictable then how about you prove your point by telling us how much money you have made trading on these predicitble ups and downs. Otherwise you are just the same shit talker who shows up every time the price moves down to say told ya so. Foolish thing to do. Does not a trader make you. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:54:45

What he is saying is that every time something is right its actually wrong unless you were right in the first place and in that case you would be wrong.
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:19:25
Except that it literally is the reason. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 23:48:35
So is there somewhere new to go to see the nodes that are open on Mainnet? The websites seem to all be down now. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:57:17
Actually Holding has been the most consistent strategy. If you trade you wont consistently make money unless you are extremely lucky. Let us know how that works out for you.

Because they think they are going to make mad bread son. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:27:52
So I own a credit card processing company. Plastic pretty much is a currency at this point. MOST currency in circulation does not exist in paper form so in essence everybody operates with how high or low their personal number is. I don't see how that is so much different than what Bitcoin could be. The difference is central control and scalping at every step. Credit cards that are issued by banks like Chase have Interchange categories attached to them. For example a sky miles card might have an interchange of 1.89% +.10 cents. That fee is paid by the merchant for just accepting that card and those funds go right back to Chase. We are talking about SERIOUS money. Who gets fucked in the end? The merchant? The customer? Both. Merchants raise their prices and the customers wind up paying. Its all balanced perfectly except the Bank makes a killing. Bitcoin changes that. Thats why I hold.

Alright I'll advise you. I charge 50% and minimum investment is 100k. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:47:05
I disagree for now. If you think you are going to convince a business to accept bitcoin and NOT convert to cash then give it a try and let me know how that works out for you. First you have to set up the payment network and only then will it start evolving into a currency where people can use that bitcoin to buy from other businesses once mass adoption starts. One step at a time. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:25:16
I think that the people that were clueless for the most part probably dumped their coins when it dropped 50%. Hodlers are in control at this point. If they get scared and sell it will drop, if not then we are stable.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:57:21

Yep. Pretty much. I am a hodler so im not happy about it going down but I dont jump on either wagon. I believe in the long term based on the tech which is the only reason you should buy IMO unless you are a gambler.

No chargeback risk so why would they care about fraud prevention? The only reason they care now is because the banks force them to pay the card holder if the seller disappears.

False. That would require 25 Million in selling which is unlikely. Volume is way to low. Same 25 Million would take us to 11,700

I get what you were asking but it has nothing to do with going short. Shorting means something specific. Trading can be more profitable if you make good trades. Most people can't so holding is best for them. You decide what is best for you.

Hey guys let's read the entire book this guy wrote because he has an opinion on the price move 
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:42:46
Your guess is still based on nothing. "It is likely they stopped accumulating at some point between 1500 and 2k or 3k" how did you determine that is likely? 
You are making so many claims that you cant back up at all. You can call it a guess but not a mildly educated one. Its a guess based on a guess of what you think would have been likely for SOME people to have done. If this was science your ass would be thrown out pretty quick.

When you and every other idiot thinks they know where the price is going to go based on charts like this and try to trade on them it creates an opportunity for others to crush you.

Oh I see. Because you KNOW where the bottom is in other assets right?
"Intrinsic" "Fundamental" and whatever other word you can make up for value is bullshit. No currency has a value other than what is assigned to it by its users.

Unless what you are saying is that Bitcoin isnt a "something" and then I would call you retarded.
Nothing is worth ANYTHING that somebody else isn't worth to pay for it. It goes for literally anything you could possibly imagine. I invest in Bitcoin because it can change the entire landscape of electronic payments. Considering I own an electronic payments company I should know.

Yes I agree with that. However when you say that most people hold to long I simply dont agree. A trader might hold to long. You could argue that I held to long from $122 because there were so many crashes. I am not saying its going to go up forever but I guarantee my ROI is higher than almost any trader out there in Crypto when my only strategy has been to hold. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:27:23

Incorrect my friend. A chargeback fee is a revenue line item that a merchant services provider can easily wave. Merchants may not know that but they can demand that fee be removed under threat of switching to another provider. 
The paperwork is time consuming though. No doubt about that. It acts as a form of arbitration in lieu of using a court in which case it would be far more time consuming. Bitcoin will eliminate chargebacks all together but litigation will increase because of it.

You can read a TON about this with the most simple search possible.
The short answer is that increasing block sizes increases mining centralization. More bandwidth and more memory to run a full node both for mining and validation. Level 2 solutions are in the works and will render larger block coins completely obsolete.

I personally dont believe altruism exists in any absolute form. Even if you self sacrifice you benefit the community you live in and therefor better your own life or at the very least the health of your species. A consequence of evolution in my opinion. Altruism would have a way of working itself out of a population rather quickly in any Darwinian model. The argument is usually about altruism in humans specifically so ca0 we are more intelligent and self aware but at the root I still don't accept it for those reasons.

I completely disagree with you all together. BTC is barely accepted anywhere. A merchant is NOT going to try and concise their supplier tonaccept their bitcoin. It's just not going to happen. People take the path of least resistance and right now that's fiat. When the path of least resistance becomes bitcoin that is when mass adoption happens. Merchant A accepts bitcoin and merchant B accepts bitcoin then it's easier to just exchange bitcoin rather than convert to fiat. Adoption starts at the consumer level NOT the merchant level.

Its wasn't Visa or Coinbase. The fault almost definitely lies with whomever Coinbase uses as their processing partner. Visa contacted the processor (merchant processor) that handles the account for Coinbase and asked them to reclassify transactions under a new MCC code. When the processor did it they must have accidentally resubmitted all the transactions under the new MCC and obtained new Authorizations rather than closing the existing authorizations with the new code. Easy mistake to make.

I dont know how the consumption compares to what the typical authorization network uses daily. I do know that there is a TON of infrastructure built around our typical financial system.

Saying I made nothing until I sell is just as retarded as saying that you dont lose money when you dont sell. Gains and losses on paper are just as real as what you have in your bank account.... on paper.
Holding implies that you hold for a period of time. I gave you every period of time where holding has made money (consistency) which I have done. Show me where you have done even nearly as well trading and I will concede the point. There actually is evidence for Bitcoin to increase, its called historical data. Now try to argue that we don't know tomorrow will happen either since there is no "evidence" to support it other than it happening for the past 4 billion years. I did NOT say that Bitcoin is guaranteed to increase which you are representing is my position my good strawman. What I said was Holding HAS BEEN the most consistent way to make money in Bitcoin. Prove me wrong with your trades that approach my returns.

It's hard to do. Most large places like a mall set up as a reseller of a processing bank so they don't pay the middleman. Chances are they will do it themselves as soon as they realize there is reasonable margin. You may be able to do it with bitcoin only because they probably know nothing about it which is where you add value. Chances are though that as it grows in popularity they will not renew their contract with you and just install their own machines.

@_date: 2018-02-28 21:40:24
3% is not true either. Most merchants have lower effective rates than 3%. Regardless it's not just the convenience that leads people to use their cards. Rewards cards cost the merchant more money to accept and pay rewards back to the cardholder. In a merchants agreemeet to accept credit cards they are not allowed to discourage the use of any specific card either lest their accounts be terminated. It's really the merchant being screwed over and I'm not sure how the average consumer is going to want to use bitcoin instead of their card for this reason. For the merchant it's an obvious choice.

Cash out if you dont believe in the tech or have a short investment timeline. Try not to let things like "I can pay off my house and go on a nice vacation" get in the way of your decisions.

CNBC literally only ever talks shit about Bitcoin. They always have. They are trash.

I know more about trading than most people actually. I was a stockbroker and worked on wall street for many years. Decided it just wasn't for me. IF I was to trade it would be options contracts, especially long straddles specifically to capitalize on volatility which it seems that Bitcoin has plenty of. 
I am not a believer in TA. I know that isn't a popular opinion but its just my opinion. I don't think that the directions that a chart moves can tell you much about where the price will go at any point in time no matter how fancy the analysis and how good the reasons. 
Couple my feeling about TA with this study from Berkeley and you see why I dont trade.

Do transactions in "normal" time frame. So basically instant transactions are better than potentially waiting 10 minutes. Well I am not a programmer so I have to ask is there a technological reason why Satoshi did not do this? Seems kind of trivial to make the blocks only 1 minute apart rather than 10.
Bitcoin can scale just fine. Lightning will render LOTS of alts obsolete. When comparing Myspace to Facebook there is a fundamental difference. Facebook was a social network that proposed you be who you actually are vs Myspace with their insanely cluttered pages of who you wanted to be. Neither of the two were the first social network anyway so why compare them at all?

A penny is the smallest denomination of currency you can carry and typically costs the mint more money to make one penny than it is actually worth. If a tenth of a penny were an actual useful figure that had reasonable buying power we would assign a significant name to it.

It does not matter what I think will happen. The point is if there is some guaranteed money to be made swing trading you would already be incredibly rich from doing so.

I think the morons who invest because they think its going to go up and make them rich should stick to their day jobs. I feel that the price will go up over time so I don't lash at people making bullshit predictions but people claiming huge numbers on the way up are just as bad if not worse. What you are doing is waiting for confirmation BEFORE making a prediction. Give a well argued reason why you think something will happen to actually help the community.

I would be interested. I have been interested in getting into Mining for a long time and just have not had the opportunity.
My hesitance has been getting the miners in the first place. For the most part I see miners like the S9 being sold out very rapidly and I don't feel comfortable being put on a waiting list AFTER buying the miner and having to wait a year to get the miners while difficulty increases.
If I decided to put up $100,000 to buy roughly 43 S9s the power cost (58,910 watts) at your costs would be $70.69 a day to mine $386.01 in Bitcoin per day at current pricing. (Not including other costs like cooling, Etc..)
If you knew of a way to instantly get S9s in bulk I would put up $250K.

If these "wise" people get you to follow whatever they say they can manipulate your ass at the drop of a hat.

This is factually untrue. I own a merchant processing company. Very VERY rarely will a bank not honor an authorization. The authorization would not be given in the first place. If your merchants have a .5% failure to capture transactions that have been authorized then you need to give me a call.  If you are referring to chargeback that your clients are losing then they must not have a good chargeback strategy in place which complies with their banks rules for accepting card not present transactions ( such as electronic address verification at the point of sale being required). 
With that being said transactions settle overnight for 95% of all settlement networks in operation. There are very few exceptions, most of the time  for good reasons except for the platform "global payments" which is just really behind with the times. Once settlement happens funds are deposited into the merchants checking account which mostly take a day to post anyway. Meaning most merchants settle today and have their funds tomorrow. 
Also, just as an FYI, Visa, MasterCard, and the other card brands with the exception of AMEX have very little to do with the whole process. They are the brands and earn brand fees such as dues and assessments. The vast bulk of the income is earned by the issuing bank of the credit card and they have nothing to do with settlement and reconciliation of a clients account.

@_date: 2018-02-28 21:56:58
If you run a sale today the funds will be in your bank account tomorrow in almost every case (cases where the money would not be there is beyond the scope of this conversation). You actually have 6 months worth of chargeback exposure which is unfortunately much longer than 60 days. That risk exposure is why a merchant services provider charges you to process transactions in the first place. An accounts risk is evaluated at the time of approval by an underwriting department. If you lose the chargeback from a transaction that is 4 months old and say you went out of business a month ago, the bank that processed the card for you is on the hook for the money.
As far as interchange goes I could not agree more. Like I said I own a processing business and I process charges for thousands of merchants, 100s of millions of dollars a year in charge volume. I HATE the current system. Sure it's made me extremely successful but it puts a tremendous amount of power in a banks hands. In the end the merchant and the consumer is getting hurt and banks are making more money than you could possibly imagine. I am a 100% Bitcoin supporter but their are some big challenges to getting the consumer to adopt it as a payment method instead of cards. For merchants the choice is very easy, no chargeback risk for example and no rewards to pay back to the cardholder which serve as negative points to the consumer.

why "should it drop much more in price"? 
Of course Bitcoin can be a store of value AND be a currency. The US Dollar does both doesn't it? The only reason why the USD is stable is because the FED exists to keep it stable. The vast majority of united states fiat does not even exist in paper form and we are supposed to believe that we are protected because its fully backed the credit worthiness of our government. Except they had taxpayers foot the bill for the bank bailouts and at the end of the entire fiasco the fucking banks got BIGGER and MORE powerful rather than being broken up. Currency is ripe for revolution.
Regular transfers need to be approved and cleared by businesses that are in complete control of the financial system. Businesses that deliberately crippled the US economy during the mortgage crisis and we had to pay for it. I will GLADLY pay higher fees to stay away from those bastards that try to tell me what I can and cannot do with my own money. Fees will not always be high anyway. There are scaling problems because Bitcoin is scaling. Give it time. Its not perfect but it is better than our current system by a long shot.

That depends on your definition of finalize. A credit card payment is converted into Fiat in your bank account in 24 hours in most cases. You will own the bitcoin faster but if you still need fiat to run your business it will require time do complete beyond confirmation of the transaction in the blockchain. 
Also, the vast bulk of the expense a merchant bears is called Interchange which is earned by the bank that issued the card. It has almost nothing to do with fraud prevention risk as that burden falls on the processing bank. Note I did say ALMOST. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:02:04
What a ridiculous question. Obviously anybody in their right mind would choose Fiat. Bitcoin is in its early stages and Fiat is recognized and accepted everywhere.

Any number is infinitely divisible. You can easily start calling a figure of important value a unique name. If a millibar is worth a hundred bucks and you still have to deal with things that cost 10 cents then you just divide the millibit by 100 and call it whatever name is accepted. It is no different than fist. Numbers like quintillion are not relevant because of how large they are though trillion and billion are.

That is like saying you can open a cash business and only report 20% of the money that comes through. Sure but That's called tax evasion.

You can try to attack my character all you want. So far this is the third post where you have not answered a simple question as to what you were referring to. If by accounts you are talking about deposit accounts then you are straight fucking delusional if you think that the insurance premiums are enough to cover a major banks failure.  The FDIC has about 25 billion dollars, most of which was complelty exhausted during the financial crisis. The bailout was designed to prevent the failure of banks which would have EASILY bankrupted the FDIC. Insurance does not mean shit  if the insurance company goes bankrupt. Just ask AIG. There is not even a law in place that guarantees the FDIC pays out.
If YOU knew anything about banking you would know the FDIC is mainly a regulator designed to instill consumer confidence in the banking system. You either get a bailout or printed money by the Fed that deflates your insured fiats value.

@_date: 2018-04-09 14:10:01
These pumps and dumps are absolutely disgusting. Another reason to hate humanity.
@_date: 2018-04-09 03:55:50
"Bitcoin Core" isnt a thing. It's just Bitcoin. Try as hard as you can to justify btrash but its just not going to happen. Your lovable shit coin has the balls to upgrade to 32mb blocks when it fills a 5th of a mb on average because nobody uses it. 5% of BTCd hashrate. "Solving" scaling problems while having no scale. Make it more and more implausible for people to run full nodes and then claim its decentralized. You have swallowed the dick of Jihan and Roger. Straight. Up. Swallowed.  
@_date: 2018-04-29 05:10:35
There has to be. Otherwise I can fork off of Bitcoin and claim we both share the genesis block then con people into buying it with no repercussions. Its straight fraud. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:33:39
Did you even read the post that I replied to? Guy claimed that everybody is cashing out vs manipulation. Captain dickface.
@_date: 2018-04-10 01:41:39
There is a different between a risky investment and an outright scam. Stop crying. Ponzi schemes, pump and dumps, etc.. will destroy the market if left unchecked. Problem with regulation? Start your own crypto and ignore the SEC. Let us know how that works out for you. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:23:55
Oh no a scary number that means absolutely nothing unless you believe in a sky daddy. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:13:29
You guys are just asking for a ban at this point. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:34:41
I find it incredible that people are willing to blindly follow and justify things that a felon and a fraud say. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:34:28
Actually I own an electronic payments company and worked on wall street as a stockbroker for years. I guarantee I know more about  banking then you do. You just aren't being clear at all with what you are TRYING to say. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:27:43
Your mother shits the bed. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:25:46
Are you being serious? 
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:22:27
An account collapse? What are you talking about?  Are you talking about one individual account?
@_date: 2018-04-11 01:47:02
But I don't so it would be nice if there was evidence that the guy can show to support the claim. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:42:44
you cant tripple stamp a double stamp.
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:39:19
Baby born baybeeeee born 
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:52:09
Volume was low going down too. Has been low all day
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:34:34
Momentum can change from up just as easily and it changed to down
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:10:35
1000 people dont cash out in a 15 minute window. Its obvious price manipulation.
@_date: 2018-04-12 18:10:50
So a guy said "its going to go up or down". Fuck man, that guy is a legend.
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:06:13
Manipulation, not volatility. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 01:10:46
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:39:27
Looks like twitter enabled the bought handle that I wont name here. Whoever owns it starts talking shit about Bitcoin right away. God I fucking hate Btrash and any jerk off that owns it.
@_date: 2018-04-12 18:44:47
Almost as predictable as retarded comments making predictions.
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:43:35
This isnt really a source showing the accumulation the OP is talking about. Would love to actually see a source supporting that claim. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:04:37
Lol you believe that whole FDIC, CDIC bullshit? During the financial collapse the taxpayer bailed them out. Where do you think that 100k would come from? 
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:42:57
You are hunting down my posts and saying more retarded shit by the second. Lower supply does not equal higher volatility. Bitcoin can be broken down to satoshis. You really need to do some learning before talking.
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:08:58
Lol you think that is the Casinos decision to not let you use a credit card?
@_date: 2018-04-29 05:17:05
Losing a public bet of 1 million dollars would do far more than a million dollars worth of damage to Warren. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 03:22:43
Correct. No idea what this guy is calling a credit card "confirmation"
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:40:10
Maybe he does, which would also not be correct lol
@_date: 2017-07-16 02:59:33
Lmao nice. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 02:23:31
"Money" does not have a stable value either. Fiat trades just like crypto does just not as volatile typically.
@_date: 2017-07-23 02:27:56
Hey it's me your brother. Tell mom and dad I need money too.
@_date: 2017-07-02 14:14:37
Farting is really bad for the atmosphere. Methane is the worst greenhouse gas and is a major problem with livestock farming.
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:20:16
I could be wrong but I thought that is why trans were taking so long to mine which drove up the trans cost. Segwit fixes this type of shit from happening so they gave up. At least that is my super basic understanding of it.
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:17:53
No. Asking for proof for a claim should be a minimal request. Lots of claims with very little support in this thread every day. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:59:27
Isn't that what just happened a few months ago?
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:29:28
$500 isn't going to happen retard
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:22:18
I just watched it happen. As soon as 2900 was hit it must have triggered TONS of sell orders. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 12:52:30
Yes. I already own a merchant processing ISO which I did an AMA if you are interested. Have any business plan yet?
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:47:02
Just taking profits I would guess. Pretty common thing to do in trading when coming up against resistance levels. Especially giving that big drop I would assume that is because the orders took time to fill all the way to 2700
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:04:13
He means he will moon you
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:28:05
Def what happened. Looks like all the orders were filled and the climb is resuming too. Will probably happen again at 3k
@_date: 2017-07-17 01:52:00
What are you talking about? Where did I say anything about bitcoin being stable. Super straw man.
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:13:33
Currency is never stable. It is always traded. You are the retard
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:33:53
Why are you on a bitcoin sub then pleb? Probably mad because you lost money thinking you knew how to trade.
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:50:30
is that a relevant question somehow or are we just asking random things? I will play along.
Do you like your blanket on the bed or folded and set on the bottom?
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:43:21
ELI5 about how its a centralized fork if you will
@_date: 2017-06-14 03:42:45
Bragging about how much bitcoin you have makes you a pleb. A fool and his money are lucky enough to get together in the first place.
@_date: 2017-06-27 02:36:01
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:02:11
I am just asking you guys to play devils advocate to both positions. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:07:18
Guys things could happen. That is all.
@_date: 2017-06-14 03:20:32
Hey guys just wanted to let you know that I'm rich. That is all. Seriously is there a point to this post?
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:26:23
It's probably to stop the crazy traffic of people to the site just checking price and then leaving. I do it myself
