Beatings will continue until morale improves.

That's Adblock Plus, not Adblock for Chrome, which is what is in the screenshot OP posted.

Not likely. Youtube uses HTML5 in its Apps and on the web. As well as a bunch of other applications.

I just realized that Satoshi Nokomato also had a bitcointalk account that hasn't been active since December 2010. If it suddenly had a message saying 'I am Craig Wright', that would convince me.

Get your eyes checked. While I do agree that joining HF doesn't make you a 'hacker' and using a tool doesn't make you a 'hacker' either. Hackforums is a success and has tons of traffic, L33t is regularly bought and now that it can be bought with BTC, BTC will see a rise in popularity.

Chargebacks are part of the reason that people hate Paypal. If a consumer wants to chargeback, they can just go to Paypal and do it, even if they got the product. I'm not sure how it's relevant, it's part of Bitcoin's many attributes.

I use Lastpass myself. All random generated passwords. Different for each site. Feels good.

I remember a post from him saying that it was too unstable, and the fact that currency had to be stable in order to be useful. I'm guessing because he recently added a "Crypto Currency" Section to the "Money" tab, he thought he'd research more into it. He saw how easy it was to pay, and there was no chargebacks. (Which was why he originally used LR.) He needed a replacement for LR, and Bitcoin was right there. I think it was inevitable.

If you think Bitcoin will settle, you don't know a single thing about Bitcoin. It is a volatile currency. It could one day be worth 2000$ then drop down to 10$.

Yet you can disable "non-intrusive advertising" if you like.

The only reason I'm reporting it is because Hackforums is a HUGE site. Just look at online.php, close to 1,000 members active in the past 5 minutes. This will definitely give Bitcoin some more popularity.

It's the Bitcoin symbol. This is akin to having an Obama campaign and claim you're 'spreading the word'. No. You aren't. At all.

For more clarity, the owner used to mostly use LR in combination with verified Paypals. This is an entirely different shift than what he usually does. Considering that the fact that the site is SO LARGE, and is starting to accept BTC, I think it's worthwhile to mention it. (Even if it does degrade Bitcoin because of the site's name. I apologize for this fact.)

What do you mean by "Two Passwords?" Huh? How do I utilize that?

While you can fake the amount of people online, that can easily be recognized by clicking a username. If it's an illegitimate user, it should take you to an access denied page. If it's real, it'll take you to their user page. Nevertheless, you should see some of the subforums, especially the lounge, they're active as shit.

Best answer. Thanks.
