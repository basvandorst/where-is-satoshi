You know you bitcoin is divisible right? There's no requirement that you buy "a bitcoin." Just buy as much bitcoin as you can afford, the units are arbitrary anyway.

I'm staying away from them ever since I learned they use MongoDB as a data store. Regardless of how many great things Coinbase may have in its favor, as far as I'm concerned that's a timebomb waiting to go off.

I had no idea Coinbase used MongoDB. They are a major player in the post-Gox Bitcoin economy. I'm legitimately troubled to learn this. There may be more nuance than "mongo == unsafe" but it's still [an entirely wrong datastore for this type of application](

Was anything *legal* sold on SR? There's a significant difference between "knowing people would use the BTC on SR" and "knowing people would buy drugs with the BTC." Why the foregone conclusion that all sales on SR were illicit? Seems like this distinction might afford Shrem some plausible deniability.

[This article]( explains Mongo's crippling problems with fault-tolerance. [This article]( goes into more detail about why Mongo might still be good for storing a specific niche type of data, but not the type of data used by most web applications. Certainly not the type of data used by Coinbase or anything involving financial transactions.
Like any technical discussion, there is nuance beyond "Mongo is bad" and its defenders will be quick to point this out. I'm aware of the advantages of Mongo (I've worked with it plenty myself) but that doesn't change the fact that for Coinbase's specific application, they are playing with fire.

I've heard that the earth is at the center of the _observable_ universe, which makes a good deal of sense. However I don't think even that is strictly true given that the universe is expanding. We should be able to see farther into the direction it's coming from, than any of the relative directions it's moving to. If I understand the physics correctly (which I probably don't).

It's a waiting game. This is how free markets work. Competent businesses will thrive, and incompetent ones will fail (which is exactly as it should be). It's a new paradigm but a good one that simply takes some getting used to. The result of this, after the initial labor pains, is going to be a truly competitive, trustworthy marketplace. But it will take some time for the cream to rise to the top. Patience and diligence are the only prescription.

What's the procedure for switching over to newer algorithms? Will it introduce compatibility issues for transferring BTC to and from different versions? And how much certainty do we have that better algorithms will always be added to Bitcoin early enough to prevent crackers from "recovering" BTC from *active* wallets?
If you ask me, the line between active and abandoned wallets is too blurred. Why shouldn't this "recovery" be considered theft in all cases? At least deep-sea shipwrecks are fairly obviously abandoned (though recently shipwrecked vessels in shallow water are more debatable). I think a better metaphor for this would be burying gold in your backyard. Even if it's been there for decades, even if you've completely forgotten about it, it's still yours. Just because somebody has a shovel doesn't mean it's right for them to dig it up.

I'm really tempted to start a "consumer reports" type of site for bitcoin businesses. It would allow user reviews from customers, as well as security assessments from professionals. Anyone could contribute to a bounty till that would be awarded to people who find and document exploits (maybe on a sliding scale, bigger rewards for finding bigger security breaches). Some brainwork would be needed to keep reviewers honest and properly incentivized, and maybe more than donations would be required to keep the site funded.
Actually, I wouldn't know where to begin making this site. Since it would itself deal in bitcoins, the same high standard of security would be required of me and I just don't have experience in that. So I'm really hoping someone will read this comment and steal the idea. :-)

Are you asking if BitInstant will send USD into your Bitcoin wallet? Bitcoin wallets can only contain bitcoins, you can't hold a balance in another currency in one. What BitInstant does is receive your USD, buy bitcoins at Mt. Gox on your behalf, and then it sends those coins to your wallet. They take a small cut for themselves. I believe the process is mostly or fully automated and it goes pretty quickly when it works. I've been a satisfied customer the two times I used it.
That said, be careful. Personally I'm holding for the long term so I haven't done any trading lately but reports indicate Mt. Gox is severely lagging and overwhelmed by DDoS attacks. I've also heard some bad stories about BitInstant's ability to handle high trade volume. If you need to acquire some bitcoins today, consider an alternative exchange like CampBX and don't use a service that relies on Mt. Gox like BitInstant does. I think that will give you the best chance of getting coins at the price you expect. A better recommendation may be just to wait for this extreme volatility to stabilize a bit.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:40:28
This is the reason I'm not worried. When the price falls there are hordes of us waiting to buy more for cheap. Of course it's going to pop but I'm not remotely interested in selling when that happens. I know I'm not alone.

I agree with you there. It was overvalued and the bubble needed to pop. Not a lot of common sense behind the sudden price increase.

Do you still believe those are effective tools for systemic change? This has been the recommended course of action since democracy was invented, and I've yet to see a shred of evidence that it's capable of ending the kind of corruption, mass surveillance, and political criminality we face today. We need to stop returning to the same old, failed, course of action. Violence isn't the answer either... We need a new toolbox.
Bitcoin is an important tool that will go into that box, but like any tool its effectiveness will depend on *how* we use it and what other instruments we can implement alongside it.
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:44:21
This is a good idea. I had trouble with a BitInstant transaction once but the problem was actually with ZipZap. In my case, I was sending cash from an automated machine that wasn't able to handle coins. I had to send an even dollar amount above the $x.95 that ZipZap wanted, and since the balance didn't match what their automated system expected, the funds were never transferred to BitInstant. A ZipZap phone CSR was able to locate my money and push it through. BitInstant had no idea what was going on because they never received the payment.

What the heck? Why are so many people talking like Bitcoin is suddenly dead? It hasn't changed. We saw the bubble, we knew something like this was likely to happen. But the blockchain soldiers on. It's still solid, revolutionary technology. It's still awesome for all the reasons it ever was. It's still selling for more than it was just a month ago, and even if it falls some more that doesn't remotely mean it *failed.* Have some vision, man. I swear, it seems like some people on here would scrap a new Ferrari they moment they hit their first pothole.

With so many services that believed they were secure getting hacked and stolen from, I'm extremely paranoid about trusting third parties with bitcoins. To any developer interested in launching a bitcoin-handling site, I can only offer this advice: Make sure you have a **solid, expert-level** understanding of net security. A site like this will have a bright red target on it for would-be thieves. If you're still learning or hope to do this as an educational project, please build something less dangerous and keep developing your skills there until you know exactly what you're doing. I can almost guarantee that an amateur (or even average-skilled) effort will end in tears.
Edited to add: And by tears I mean possible lawsuits or even criminal charges. Be very careful.

This can be easily solved by a third-party rapid transaction service, which is essentially an online wallet provider that allows its users to send and receive bitcoins among themselves instantly. These transactions wouldn't actually use the Bitcoin network but would be handled internally with no confirmations required. As long as the transaction service is trustworthy, merchants could consider payments received the moment they're sent by customers. (Later on the funds could be withdrawn to another wallet, which would include the standard delay, but at least the crucial POS wait time would be removed.)
There are drawbacks which would be mitigated over time as a service became more trusted and popular:
* Both merchants and customers need accounts
* Customers need to add funds to their accounts well in advance, which requires waiting for confirmations
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:59:10
I don't think bitcoin will be accessible for the mainstream without at least one layer of abstraction. New systems need to be built on top of the blockchain and *those* are what people will use without knowing (or needing to know) what's going on under the hood.
I don't think many people will be keeping their own wallets on their PCs in the future. Too many security risks, too much technical knowhow required. Central banks may be obsolete but most people are still going to want to keep their money in a reliable, hack-resistant account. I'm not sure about the implications of deflation but I imagine banks will still issue loans and interest-generating savings accounts. Fractional reserve will continue on with BTC.
Payment processors will spring up to overcome the transaction delays. You won't be sending bitcoin from one address to another, you'll be using your Visa "bitcard" like you do with debit cards today. If not Visa, then whatever other trusted competitors appear to fill the need. The company will decrement your balance and increment the seller's instantly. Whatever BTC movement needs to occur behind the scenes will be invisible to both parties and the delay will be irrelevant.
I think we're already seeing the barriers to acquiring bitcoin fall today. The "ATMs" (really vending machines) are on the way and [LocalBitcoins]( seems to be working pretty well. [BitInstant]( has a relatively easy method too, not as easy as we'd like but a big step in the right direction.
We're still in the very early days of decentralized digital cryptocurrency. Like any technology, it needs time to mature. We need smart, charismatic businesspeople to make it easier for the masses. There are huge market needs just waiting to be filled.

That's interesting. The permanence of the blockchain makes it impossible to DMCA; whatever's put in will be there forever. To take it a step further, you could theoretically store any data in there, from Wikileaks files to whatever personal data you want to make available from anywhere and completely undeleteable. Free, unlimited cloud storage. If somebody made an easy tool for "blockchaining" files and easily retrieving them again... well, this might be the intrinsic value people are looking for in BTC.
File sharing could just be the beginning. Bitcoin could become the underlying protocol for other P2P platforms, things never intended or imagined by Satoshi. But how would the network handle this? Seems like it would very quickly result in a colossal blockchain, with latency issues that would hurt Bitcoin's responsiveness as a currency. How scalable is Bitcoin? If it's meant to handle the financial transactions of the world, can it handle the P2P traffic of the world on top of that? Theoretically speaking.
More importantly: If some agency wished to make BTC unviable as a currency, is this method (overloading the blockchain with millions of frivolous transactions) a legitimate attack vector? That wouldn't even require formatting data in them, just a handful of bots bouncing .00000001 BTC back and forth between two wallets as fast as possible. Something like a DDOS attack. I assume this risk has been discussed and dismissed already?
Edit: I guess this is what the transaction fees are for. Piggybacking on the blockchain for arbitrary data transmission isn't useful if you have to pay a fee for each transaction... and a high volume of no-fee transactions will be dismissed as spam. That's a smart way to combat abuse of the network.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:52:02
That's why I prefer "bit" instead of "microbitcoin." Nobody uses SI prefixes for any other currency (kiloeuro? decidollar?) so why would we go against the grain? *Technically* .000001 BTC is a microbitcoin but I think it's pretty unintuitive to call it that for regular commerce.

@_date: 2013-11-25 18:03:50
I've been giving a lot of thought to BTC base units since [this discussion]( a few days ago, and I feel that the best option is to use μBTC but not call it that. My proposal:
1 Bitcoin (**฿**) = 1 million Bits (**Ƀ**)
A balance of ฿1.87654321 can be referred to as Ƀ1,876,543.21, or "one million, eight hundred seventy-six thousand, five hundred forty-three bits and twenty-one satoshis."
Here's my reasoning...
* SI/metric units are great, but non-standard for currencies. Even in fully metric Europe you don't refer to "kiloeuros" or "millieuros". That's awkward and unintuitive for most people. Also, few people can type "μ" or know how to pronounce it, leading to substituting the letter "u" which is just strange.
* "Microbitcoin" or "microbit" is a mouthful. "Bit" is simpler, monosyllabic, and [there's already a precedent]( for using it in reference to money.
* Millibits aren't small enough to use as a long-term solution. Do we really want to have this discussion again 2 years into a hypothetical future where BTC is selling for $10,000?
* Euros and dollars alike are divided into 100 cents but no more. That's a manageable, familiar fraction that also conveniently leaves this base unit with [SI symmetry](
* People seem to really like "satoshis." With this model that becomes the new cent; there are 100 satoshis in one bit.
* Another problem I'm trying to solve is the currency symbol issue. The most common symbol I've seen for Bitcoin is ฿, followed by Ƀ. Unfortunately the former is already in use by the [Thai Baht]( The Ƀ symbol (alternately ƀ, which I also like) isn't used for anything. What I'm proposing is that we use *both* symbols...
The US dollar has two currency symbols, $ for dollars and ¢ for cents. As it's inflated, the cent symbol is increasingly irrelevant. A deflationary currency like BTC should move in the opposite direction, with smaller units becoming more important over time. Therefore we can keep the ambiguous symbol attached to the less relevant unit, and gradually transition to the less ambiguous one without confusing anything. No renaming existing units or reassigning existing symbols. ฿ will always mean "bitcoin" and Ƀ will always mean "bit".
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:17:37
I mean I contacted ZipZap (1-888-734-7270) since the problem wasn't actually with BitInstant. This probably isn't relevant to your problem or the OP's, but I discovered an interesting quirk with buying BTC this way:
I was using a Vcom kiosk in a 7-Eleven. The machine accepts cash so I fed it some bills. But it turns out the machine can't return coinage for change. ZipZap was expecting an exact payment of $203.95 but the machine sent them an overpayment of $204.00. The extra nickel didn't bother me but it did bother ZipZap's automated system and my money was stuck in limbo. But I explained the situation over the phone and it sounded like this was a pretty common problem. The CSR manually accepted the funds and a couple minutes later I had my bitcoins.

"Bitcoin is a new form of virtual cash with a lot of advantages over traditional currencies. You can use it to send money anywhere in the world in minutes over the internet, without Western Union taking a cut. It can't be arbitrarily inflated or counterfeited, and it's cryptographically secure so you're the only one who can ever access your own money, if you use it safely. A lot of people are investing in it because it's increased in value from under $5 to over $200 in less than two years and made the early adopters into millionaires, and it still seems to have a lot of potential to go up."

Note for the BitInstant team: Thanks for what you guys do. I've used your service twice with no problems. Actually there was a ZipZap issue unrelated to BitInstant the second time; I resolved it with them and received my bitcoins from you moments later. I just had to post something appreciative to counter the complaints (and outlandish accusations of criminality).
We're all learning how to use this new technology, which is still in its early infancy. There will be bumps along the way. It's clear you're doing the best you can to resolve customer issues and develop your service to maturity. Satisfy your user base and don't let them discourage you. Anyone participating in the bitcoin economy needs to have realistic expectations and know you simply aren't going to get robust, world-class performance from any of these start-ups. Yet. BitInstant seems to be one of the emerging leaders, with a great business model, resilience, and a lot of potential.
Now that I've lavished you with praise, how about some good news about that BTC MasterCard?

The USD is crashing but nothing nearly as dramatic as the BTC price rise. This is another bubble, just like the one in July 2011. Your action at this time should depend entirely on what your goals are with bitcoin.
I'm only focused on the long-term, say 10 years out or more. I expect BTC will become a lot less volatile over time, and continue to increase in value as more people use it. Consider that there can never be more than 21 million BTC in existence. That's a pretty small number of units in circulation globally. $30 per BTC seems downright cheap in light of that. I think there will be a lot more bubbles to pop before it stabilizes, but when it does I predict that price will be surprisingly high relative to the dollar.
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:36:15

The ability of miners to arbitrarily disregard transactions is one of the most troubling things about Bitcoin to me. I understand the need for safeguards against abuse. But what if the majority of miners cartelized to maximize revenue, agreeing to ignore all transactions without X fee amount? They can hold the entire currency hostage this way. The market incentives are certainly there for them to do that so what's preventing that from happening now, apart from goodwill? Can we count on that goodwill lasting into the future?
I'm a BTC enthusiast but if I can't have certainty that *every* transaction I make will complete, I'm left with a very uncomfortable feeling about the long term. I'll pay small fees voluntarily to speed up important transactions, but I'm not interested in mandatory ones for all transactions or the guessing game of never knowing if I included a high enough bribe. Someone smarter than me, please quell my fears.

The math's a bit over my head so forgive me if this is a dumb question... what happens if "the right type of quantum computer" already exists? What's to stop some government from developing such a system in secret, and stealing all BTC from all known public keys in one fell swoop? That would cripple this economy overnight.
Is that a plausible threat? If so, a couple questions about how to respond to it: First, if it were to happen tomorrow could we roll back the blockchain to before it happened, thereby undoing the catastrophe? Would it be possible to roll it back selectively so unrelated transactions were not also removed from the record? Second, if "post-quantum cryptography" (mentioned in the article) exists today, why not update the BTC protocol to use that *now*? Why wait until it's too late?
