The mere fact that they compare Bitcoin to the US Dollar and are afraid of it validates Bitcoin. It means it's at the US Dollar level or better. It is better for various reasons, such as decentralisation, immutability, non-censorability, deflationary state and the like. You know, what the US Dollar is not.

If you use enough blockchain energy you can and you will create what is known (colloquially) as a scamhole. The server pattern equation predicts that.
Past the event horizon of a scamhole, scammers are lost forever. They simply "end" in the "scam singularity", together with the scamtime continuum. Please note that scam number is not conserved, similar to the baryon number in a black hole.

How can the dollar change be so little on the last two lines but the percentage so big? Something is wrong.
