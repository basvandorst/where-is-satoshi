I want it
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:52:29
Ya I can help you with that list if you want. And then put it through random.org
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:47:53
And how are you planning to get there?
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:02:50
It surely did, thank you
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:22:22
You are right on point with the ease of use, it is way simpler with nicehash just run and forget about it. On average I got around 25% more my way but that implied me looking for value in alts and fine-tuning my rig for different algos ~~24/7~~ every day.
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:02:14
One big pie of possibilities
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:23:40
I did not actively trade, I just exchanged mined alts for BTC
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:22:44
Mining best alts based on the projected profitability of a particular period and then exchanging them for btc
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:42:16
Maybe I'll give it a try, thanks. And also, nice thing you did for that guy in the other thread. You da real mvp
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:04:27
Cheers man

To stay all law and tax friendly, your best bet is the bank.
The first and most logical thing to do is to talk about it with your bank and then, even if they give you green light to proceed with the sale, you should be prepared with proofs of ownership, origin of the coins and of course, a good lawyer.  Tax agencies tend to get suspicious around big chunks of money.

Hold my beer
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:07:18
Yeah.. In my situation I can only dream about that
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:24:32
Yeah I thought about that but it scares me thinking I could lose my precious hard-earned tenth
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:47:26
I'm not your buddy, fam. Grazie
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:40:04
1. Not a teenager, just living in a poor country.
2. I just wanted to share my achievement with this comunity, didn't expect so much attention.
3. It's 270 bucks you dense mofo
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:01:23
Way to make it sound better, thanks 
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:38:32
Started with dgb then zec, zcl, zen, eth, sib x11. What specific hardware? One regular pc with gtx1070. And yes, only mined in pools
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:59:09
Haha, thank you. Although unlikely at these rates, I hope for the best
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:33:46
Be careful when choosing what to mine and always fine-tune your rig to perfection. And also, never hold on a profitable mined coin if you don't have real reasons to belive its value will increase further.
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:00:03
Cheers homie
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:40:23
Sure I am
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:50:48
Gracias. Read a couple comments up
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:43:52
I have a job in IT(entry level technician) but all my main income goes to supporting my (big) unfortunate family and I can't really save anything for investing.
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:25:57
Grazie ~~Shitty~~ Shatty!
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:27:28
Oh my bad, I thought you were talking about mining earnings
@_date: 2017-07-25 10:46:38
Well you know what they say, *sharing is caring*
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:14:20
Been called worse but thank you anyway
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:48:11
Read up
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:19:01
Yeah if low-end mining will still be profitable for that long
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:46:17
Actually the electricity bill is paid 50/50 by me and my fam and is kinda cheap anyway so yeah, it was worth mining
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:16:15
Not offended, I understand your frustration and I must admit you are right about this subreddit's "pollution"
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:15:55
Actually I tried that for a week and turned out it was less profitable that way. (single gpu btw)
