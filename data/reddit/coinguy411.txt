Nope. Also, keep in mind BCT was down yesterday due to DDOS (supposedly).

Can you tell me what your experience was like? Is there any limits? How did it go?

Ahhh yea that's definitely the same author. I suppose it could be just a coincidence that they obtained these emails.. or they somehow obtained an email dump with little to nothing else.

They do verify identity, and their spot price is a bit higher than bitstamp, but that accounts for the credit card processing fee and is still MUCH cheaper than buying from places like CoinMX, which is where I used to buy from. I'll be sticking with Trucoin from now on.

I saw they are partnered to be the official ATM at the bitcoin bowl or something like that... They seem legit and all, I'm just curious what people's experiences have been thus far. I'm hesitant to give my CC info out for obvious reasons.

Good point!

A few people I know who got the email, myself included, got it at addresses only used on one of those two sites.

Yea we know. There was a thread yesterday where someone called him Thermos. I think it's going to stick now.
