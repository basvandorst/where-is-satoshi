Sounds good, on reflection I regret giving all of my personal details to Mtgox and then bitstamp...

Not sure if joking.
Or mentally handicapped.

No we're not.

It's not actually USD that I'm transferring, rather GBP. Annoying as EUR transfers are going through.

I wish it would just stabilise so I can have confidence in spending the stuff again! It was a perfectly viable form of currency until everyone started trying to get rich with it over the last year. It's supposed to be analogous to cash not an investment.

If I had some money sitting in mtgox other than BTC I would be sitting with my finger on the trigger waiting to buy more. As it is I would have to wait 3-4 days for a bank transfer.

lag on mtgox is under 50 minutes now and the trading price has definitely leveled out some.

Give up, I waited 3 months. You can cancel the withdrawal and within minutes have your money back. (Which says a lot about all the "processing" they are doing...) Then buy BTC and transfer to Bitstamp, had my GBP in a matter of days.

Personally I'm not planning to sell. Obviously I am not the market, but at least a portion of it.

"We didn't listen!!"

It does make for painful watching, but nobody can tell you what the price will be in a week. Assuming you 'invested' risk money, then surely there is no point withdrawing it now? I am in a similar situation, however the current price has only just dipped below my purchase price. My personal advice, to everyone is BUY, BUY, BUY! More demand = higher value.

So frustrating! Exacerbated by their customer support.
@_date: 2013-09-17 11:54:30
OK so I find out Coinbase are only for US citizens after setting up an account. Waiting on verification for a BitStamp account as they say they can handle UK banks, and waiting for MtGox to cancel my withdrawal...
I think I'll stick to regular currency, such a PITA.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:47:21
It's fake
@_date: 2013-09-16 15:37:28
So they can process cancelling withdrawals that quickly then? 
@_date: 2013-09-16 17:54:13
Interested to know if there is anyone out there who has been waiting for a long time such as I have, but recently received their transfer? May end up transferring to somewhere else though...
@_date: 2013-09-16 17:20:03
The transfer I'm waiting on is GBP.
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:47:02
Yes by cancelling the withdrawal, buying bitcoins again and sending them to bitstamp!!!
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:51:23
Just look at it as a gold rush. When people see that other folk are gaining new found wealth rapidly through new means; you could argue that it would be foolish of people not to jump on board, rather than them being selfish for doing so. It's human nature to possess an element of greed, regardless of religious views I would argue that greed is a vital part of anything's survival, human or otherwise.

The unbearable lag on mtgox and some other traders being completely offline is exacerbating the panic greatly.
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:42:56
I have to disagree, people are still spending it.
One of the most widely talked about uses of Bitcoins; SilkRoad is still becoming more and more popular thanks to all the media press. To a large portion of these people, buying drugs is still more of a priority than playing the market and investing, it must be as SR traders are ever more busy.

I much prefer this graph, it goes back up again.
Yeah I think I'm just going to stare at this graph, while slowing rocking in my seat...
