If you put all of your money in, you’re an idiot and deserve to be broke... 
If you put some money in every month, you deserve the wildest of riches?
@_date: 2018-08-25 12:57:37
Because if you have no understanding in how markets and trading work.. let alone the psychology that goes into it.. you get destroyed before you know it.. lol

Beyond your wildest dreams
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:31:47
That’s what I read it as.. lol

Wait.. where did I read that only 8% of Americans are into (bought) bitcoin or other crypto currencies?
@_date: 2018-08-17 11:02:09
@_date: 2018-08-20 01:47:35
Me too
@_date: 2018-08-23 15:34:33
I AGREE WITH WHAT wE ARE TALKING ABOUT!
@_date: 2018-08-18 12:40:35
People do get so bent over this... ultimately, who gives a shit... If someone wants to own their own, great! If they want someone else to handle that end, great!
I agree though.. this will 100% have its place in the future.
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:19:29
But isn’t that the point... to be used as a day to day cash option?... it’s tough to do that knowing that today I might have a whole cart of groceries... but tomorrow it might only be worth a bag of chips..
@_date: 2018-05-27 19:26:16
I believe so.. and potentially some cardboard
@_date: 2018-05-14 11:05:38
Wasn’t 8.6k in December either
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:23:02
I get that... I’m just saying.. to make bitcoin the “cash system” it’s made to be would be difficult at this point.. not as an investment.. but to be used everyday..
@_date: 2018-05-14 21:05:49
In a jungle?
@_date: 2018-05-14 11:04:36
You’re missing my point.. not being used as an investment.. but as a currency
@_date: 2018-08-12 02:08:05
I agree! Adoption is adoption.. get over yourselves
@_date: 2018-08-10 01:49:06

Don’t be ridiculous.. 18 months
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:13:59
Yea a $1.20 coke that day instead of $1.00 not really a big deal... a $120,000 instead of $100,000 is slightly different...
That whole percentage thing.. you know..
@_date: 2018-08-12 02:07:00
But ultimately, who gives a shit?
@_date: 2018-05-14 21:06:12
But I agree... 
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:33:29
So that’s what that emoji means? This close?... I always thought it was “ok”

Lol drugs... let me try to be a little clearer for you... you, my friend, responded to my comment asking - no body uses SD cards anymore?... but my comment said that I was kidding and that my camera and laptop also use them.. also, that, I thought it just sounded funny this day and age.... 
Anyone else? I believe this guy is serious, but don’t understand where the miscommunication is... 
@_date: 2019-09-25 00:43:32
You made me laugh.  ty
@_date: 2018-07-06 11:14:46
You literally replied to my comment that people do...��

In addition... I made the letters bolder because your “what?” Signified that you didn’t quite pick up what I had put down...
@_date: 2018-07-05 15:37:31
I know.. just sounds funny at this point... my dslr still uses one and my laptop also has one..
@_date: 2019-09-14 01:38:07
I loves to sarcasm bro
@_date: 2019-09-29 12:42:57
Which guy? Kota or lonely?
@_date: 2019-09-12 23:51:13
I agree.. he should be losing at least 50% on those 10 trades
@_date: 2019-09-25 00:36:17
Sounds more like a great crack addict
@_date: 2019-09-29 12:50:52
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:07:21
Didn’t bother me.. was just a weird question based on what I said... I personally still use SD cards in my cameras and older laptop for processing pictures
@_date: 2018-07-06 17:33:22
__YOU LITERALLY REPLIED TO MY COMMENT THAT PEOPLE DO USE THEM...__
