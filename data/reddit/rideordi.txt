Insert “black, Hispanic, anything other than white” in any statement involving race and see what happens.  We live in a time where it’s socially acceptable to talk negatively about white people and socially unacceptable to say anything about race otherwise.

During peak bull run I bought a bunch of furniture with gains.  Don't cash out.  Spend when it's peaking.

People tripping on the price this week need to calm the hell down.  We blew through 10k CONFIDENTLY and went straight to near 14k before correcting.  We're consolidating in the 11-12k zone which is fantastic.  Consolidation over 10k and people are worried smfh

You could have tripled your money already had you gotten in at the bottom.  That's pretty optimistic in itself.

Many of the cannabis delivery services use cards that you “load” with a purchase on your credit card, then pay with the loaded card.  Couldn’t dispensaries do something similar by accepting cryptocurrency, then automatically selling on an exchange?  Or are the exchanges under too much scrutiny to risk it?

This seems like the one of the most obvious use cases for cryptocurrency the USA currently.  Federal banks won’t take dispensaries money and most credit cards don’t want to play ball.

Depends on your perspective.  Tipped employees who walk with cash have a different point of view.  Sticking cash in a bank has tax consequences.  So does bitcoin....but if I spend my bitcoin from a year ago, I get to promote use and can also claim a loss on my taxes to offset stock gains ; )

Can I send from Coinbase Pro to Native Segwit?

So I just updated the firmware on my ledger nano s after letting it sit for over a year untouched.   I downloaded a new bitcoin wallet to the ledger and it has the option for “Segwit” as well as “native segwit” bitcoin wallets.  What’s the difference?  Which wallet should I transfer my coins to?
