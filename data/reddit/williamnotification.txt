1) Congress has oversight of and access to plenty of things that are classified. That's the only distinction I was making.
2) You can certainly make the argument that the Fed should be *more* accountable to Congress. I'd agree. The Federal Reserve Transparency Act might have been a good step towards that.
The Fed is accountable to Congress, at least somewhat. The Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 is the law in question. Should it go farther? Probably. But saying the Fed is unaccountable is incorrect, and claiming that the lack of publicly available audits is the same as total unaccountability is *moving the goalposts* on that claim.

Congress is not the public.

Look at those goalposts go!

I get that you're angry about this, and I don't expect to reach consensus. My views are not as extreme as yours (e.g. I would give the legislature plenty of blame for our debt mess -- not 100%, but certainly not 0%) so there's probably no way either of us will convince the other.
My opinion is that you can have some degree of accountability (again, I agree that it's not enough) without fully granular information about inner workings.
You, as a citizen, have no power to dismantle the nuclear program. A paper trail saying "this wouldn't exist without me" is not the same as "I have influence over this currently." Congress has the power to effectively oust the Fed board of governors every 4 years. If they think that the Fed is doing a shitty job, *regardless of why*, those guys lose their appointments. They apparently don't think that (again, shared responsibility).
I hope that makes it clearer what I was trying to say. I don't expect to convince you, nor you to convince me, so I'm going to leave this thread in your capable hands. Rest assured, I understand where you're coming from and hope you have a nice day.
