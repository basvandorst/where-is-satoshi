It is a whole 1.5 more data points than most predictions on here have going for them.

Recycling jokes from more than five years ago... Okes really are grasping at straws in this sub when the market is bear.

As a Zimbabwean couple of things to point out to those who dont know
- That was after 9 noughts had already been rebased off the currency so add 9 back on to get to the original value
- The zim dollar no longer exists, everything is now US dollars and government printed "bond" notes which they try to peg to the USD (think tether)
- Many of the principles of economics which lead to trillion dollar notes are being played out by scammers in crypto (again think tether and how they "print" money when they need it)
- Yes those were crazy times in Zimbabwe, we issued quotations which were valid for 15 minutes else the price changed.  Prices in the shops changed twice a day at least so your beer cost less at 9am than it will at 5pm.  We literally carried around bags of money and transacted by the weight or brick of money not counting each one.  None of the banking systems could handle these figures so all internal transactions were done in millions to 1 convertions and customers didnt care they could lose literally millions on a rounding error when multiplying up or down, because those millions were worth not even a US cent.

Not very, Vast majority of the population has never heard of it. There are tech people who speak of and use it but outside that community only some people who try to externalise funds with it.  But seen as most people are sitting on "bond" dollars not real US dollars the premium on the bitcoin price is around 70% (golix.com is the local exchange).
