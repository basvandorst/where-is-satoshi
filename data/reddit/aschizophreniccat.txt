Thanks. Unfortunately they do not have an option for vanilla cards. Do have a target card I don't need, so was useful for that and I sent them an email for a quote. Much appreciated.

It's a litecoin clone. Not a bitcoin clone. 
Edit: also, they just seem mad about the copying/similar theme of the name of the cryptocurrency. They aren't worried about them copying their protocol. If you know anything about altcoins, then you can see this is just another scrypt clone shit coin. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:46:37
That is different. You at least understand how crazy cryptocurrencies can be, and you most likely understand this shit could be the future.
I tried to get my dad into bitcoin around 250 dollars and he refused. He's a big stock market guy, but bitcoin is completely different and unknown to him. From his financial standpoint, all he saw was an unstable currency in which he didn't understand, so he opted out. Yeah, he missed out on bitcoin, but it's this kind of rationale that has made him so much money in the stock market.

I wasn't referring to doge at all in that comment.. I was referring to every altcoin that has ever been made/is being made. Your fake worded insults don't hurt me as I don't even own any doge.. Converted it all to Blackcoin awhile back.

Thanks mate! :D 
We may disagree on somethings, but in the end we both use and obviously enjoy bitcoin, and that's all that matters to me. Cheers! 
@_date: 2014-05-09 15:15:48
I think it's cool people are trying to make cryptocurrencies with every hashing algorithm. If we can make an improved bitcoin, then why not try for it? 
Seems like you hate the ideas of this because you are invested too much in bitcoin. Sounds like you need to diversify your crypto portfolio!

Ahah, I actually say usually always a lot, never really stopped to think if it was a contradicting statement or not. Today I learned..

Pretty sure I read someone already made up a SR 4, and it's ready to be launched right if/when the new one gets shut down. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 16:18:17
Yeah, there's usually always one redditor who has to shit on OP. Nothing wrong with promoting 
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:15:04
They haven't won anything. Shutting down SR was their biggest takedown. Since then so many different markets have sprung up, the community has made it so there'll always be a place to go. SR 2 wasn't even good.

@_date: 2014-05-09 15:08:18
It's a litecoin, scrypt based clone. Claiming every crypto has "copied" bitcoin is stupid. Just because litecoin based off bitcoin, doesn't mean it's the same. Different algos mean completely different coins.  If it were Sha-256 hashing algo then it would be impossible to mine 1,000's of Dogecoin! 
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:15:52
Same basis it would go below 100 dollars. Bitcoin is unpredictable. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:57:35
I used SR and I now use different markets to get my things. I definitely like the fact SR 2 and 3.0 were made though, sure, they were/are unreliable markets, but it is a great 'fuck you' to the FBI. But a lot of idiots did just assume it was the best because of the SR name, which was obviously not the case. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 01:16:33
Don't hate on me for saying this.. But I'm surprised Flappycoin, the coin officially licensed from the creators of Flappybird, is not used for this game! 
@_date: 2014-05-09 15:54:40
I never said dogecoin was innovative, I said it was a scrypt clone. 
Developers making coins using different algos with different protocols can possibly lead to a better coin than bitcoin. That's what I'm saying. I'm not praising dogecoin. 
Altcoins can be innovative, look at Blackcoin or NXT. Don't discredit all altcoins just because so many shitty ones have been made. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:58:39
That's why it's a fuck you.. It shows how pointless their job is when it comes to shutting these markets down.

Two years ago on Christmas I got my family bitcoin wallets with 50 dollars a piece. They were all pretty disappointed, and asked wtf they would even do with that.. I said spend it, or save it -
 cause you never know, could be worth 10k one day!
They all ended up not using it.. and lost the paper wallets.. Now all of em have been saying they hope to find that paper wallet one day. 
We all used to be considered crazy for investing and utilizing these cryptocurrencies... No one gave a shit about this a few years ago besides us computer people. Look at us now! People are actually excited about Bitcoin, and are happy to talk about it - what a day to be alive!

China.. Eastern Europeans who've made 50 mil+ running DNMs. Motive is more money - greed. You truly think growth like this is natural? Come on now. 
I mean honestly, there is a reason this doesn't happen in the stock market - regulation deters and prevents manipulation. Unregulated markets are easy targets, especially btc.. where you can have bots run 24/7 and completely control the market with just a few huge players.

Your beliefs are clouding your judgement. Bitcoin is not the future of money. Though, I do believe Blockchain technology is game changing. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:19:39
Possibilities are practically endless. I think the Blockchain is great tool for proof of ownership. Blockchain tech could be huge for the financial sector as well. Financial companies are already working on implementing Blockchain's within their corporations. 
Do you only follow bitcoin or something? Some alt-coins have done interesting things with the blockchain. I think the possibilities of what the blockchain can accomplish is still in its infancy. Ether's blockchain with programmable smart contracts immediately comes to mind. Blockchain goes way beyond just providing a distributed ledger for money based transaction.

It’s just a result of inexperienced, high leveraged traders in a relatively illiquid market. Claiming a “manipulation” is just a cop out spewed by inexperienced observers.

I'm already on another Marketplace. There are two other main competitors.
@_date: 2018-12-31 04:30:27
Manipulation is a conspiracy theory. Shorts close, shorts re-buy btc at spot. Longs close, long sell back btc at stops. Day traders setup stops in these close ranges, and they can cascade quickly due to the relatively illiquid market. It’s not rocket science. 
Just Google “short squeeze” and “long squeeze”. It can happen often in these short time frames due to illiquidity. Something you wouldn’t see as often in stock markets.

I think my Secret Santa a 12 year old troll.. Kid seriously makes the worst comments in the strangest subs. I'm considering printing out a wallet address or something and giving him a small amount of bitcoin, but I can't tell if he deserves it or not..

All the neckbeards on reddit tend to hate Kanye, especially after they saw that interview of him on the front page last week.. But the fact is he is one of the most successful rappers/artists right now, so the fact he was nominated does make sense.

I've always bought them and spent them quick in hopes of it not going down. I've spent around 5 bitcoins on several hundred dollars worth items because of this. Whatever, I didn't invest, but I feel I helped contribute by actually spending my coins. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:39:51
I feel like such a small amount of us actually buy things with bitcoins.. When it comes to bitcoin most people around here only care about making money off selling the coins, even if they claim to support the currency. 
I looked up one of my old wallets and saw I spent around 8 bitcoins even though I only spent around 500 dollars. Cool stuff, I'm not even mad I didn't invest. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:26:12
I would like to give a small amount of Bitcoin to my brothers and my dad. I've been talking about it so much I figured I might as well just make them a wallet at this point... Plus it would be a fun gift for them.
