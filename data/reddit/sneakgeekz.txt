Switching from Facsim, Communism, Socialism, Democrat or Republican is just readjusting the deck chairs on the Titanic? We know how that turned out. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 14:40:46
I did not get the email. But I figured it out. I removed my primary email from facebook and then I reinstated my primary email and then it worked. This is the 2nd time this has happened to me. Is there another option for me to login if I created the account via facebook?

I have to register to read the article...? No thank you. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 14:56:29
Yes been waiting for awhile now. We definitely need a ACH coin base alternative.

Max Keiser on the Alex Jones show. Ill never forget it. They are both rambling about the coming US dollar crash and Max mentions but "bitcoin will be the currency of the resistance" good thing it was a video because I had no idea what he said. But I felt I needed to not just skip this but actually hear it. So I kept rewinding until i can could make out his words under his lisp. 
That was the beginning for me about 14 or 15 months ago. I ended up closing down 2 of my businesses and now I do bitcoin full time. 2013 was an incredible ride. 
Just like the new zhong t video. Thats my story. I lost hundreds of coins but I'm not looking back. I'm going to the Mooon!
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:52:31
Lbc is a trusted platform I've been using it for about 2 years your coins should be safe. The host outage has been a common occurrence every several weeks. I think the last time it lasted 2-3 days. Just be patient. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 00:54:50
Checked out the site. What type of payments are accepted and how much does it weigh?
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:04:20
Please post paragraph. I'm not interested in clicking on a link to a adult industry review site. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 17:45:49
I just tried to use your site. When will it back for purchases in NJ?

As for friends and family that are interested Ive been thinking about giving them a cloud contract for b'day and holidays. Set them up with a mycellium wallet and the gyft  app. I think this will create the most engagement and positive reinforcement. Its always cool to see the deposits coming into your wallet and have the option to buy toilet paper or what ever with gyft.
@_date: 2014-03-17 04:22:38
Here is a good article 
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:36:28
 3-5%. Is a fair price to pay for privacy. With Coinbase or most exchanges your name and btc purchases are recorded. 
As far as I know the only thing recorded in a lamassau transaction are wallet addresses. 
You can't compare these to bank atms.
@_date: 2014-11-03 02:17:08
I'm thinking about setting peeps up with a mycelium wallet, Gyft app and giving them a  cloud contract. I think them seeing the regular payments going into there wallets with the option of spending via gyft is more engaging. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 17:35:13

I suggest you get your funds off of that reloadit card since the code is out in the wild. Maybe buy a reloadable debit card and put your funds on it. If t doesn't work then that person possibly scammed you.

Hmm lets see cults have charismatic leaders and followers with blind faith in the unseen. Most bitcoiners I know are nerdy and not very charismatic. Our faith is in  mathematics, cryptography and the very tangible blockchain.

Where can I buy those goggle glasses?
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:06:30
Why don't they buy and hold or start mining? Bitcoin is paying my bills and I'm sure it can pay their's if they want it to. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:24:34
There is always risk. The best way to mitigate make sure they send cash and you pick up cash before sending/releasing coins. But know that even after you pick up your cash the person can contact WU and say they were scammed.  WU has your details so they could potentially bill you. I personally have used WU many times via localbtc and never had an issue yet.  
  
edit: I also never trade more than $999 per day per person just in case its a FED.

NONE OF THEM. If you are not a professional trader then you have no business being on an exchange. (I learned that valuable lesson in 2013 after a 500 plus Bitcoin scam/loss.) If you are a professional trader then you should know better than to send money to an exchange with zero transparency, third party oversight and insurance. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 17:40:31
Capital controls are in play and cash is becoming undesirable and politically incorrect. When I tried to deposit cash into my nephew's Chase account they no longer accept cash deposits from non chase customers. They told me to go to post office and purchase a money order or use a personal check.

Didn't read your whole post. But brawker.com does what your title request.
@_date: 2014-07-23 15:16:15
What are they're btc/usd rates?
If they match bitstamp/coinbase rates this will be a winner.
@_date: 2014-11-13 02:01:49
Yeah the temp is dropping tonight in NJ. I just dusted off and powered up two 100gh 1000 watt Avalon's. Ouch!
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:28:45
One reason is new members of the communist party are going after older members for corruption. These older members are trying to hide wealth before they flee. I also think many average chinese citizens do not have faith in there national currency and are hedging with btc. Also there has been a big uptick in the number of chinese that are immigrating out of China to Australia, Canada and USA. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 14:44:16
Good luck! Ive been doing some research considering getting one for NY/NJ. I'm thinking a skyhook to get my feet wet. If it goes well then I may upgrade to a 2way ATM. 2way seems to speed up ROI. Keep us updated on how it goes.

What you should be asking is,"should you get married?" If both of you are already calculating how to split assets then your hearts are not in right place. Maybe your into that stuff. Me I'm old fashion and believe in the line "through sickness and health, till death do us part". You both need to do some soul searching. Good luck.
@_date: 2014-05-17 22:06:31
Yeah down for me too. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 16:44:10
HE'LL NO! 
@_date: 2014-04-08 20:48:02
This is not bitcoin related. 
But the nuance of this is protecting copy rights and patents. I'm a believer in open source.
Most of the people I know dealing with fakes are people that are very poor and cannot afford the product because of artificial prices. 
There are more cases of injuries  from patented products than from fakes. 
This project sounds like big propaganda coup for international monopoly corporations.
@_date: 2014-06-01 23:29:26
Yeah same here. Went down in the middle of a couple of trades.
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:57:28
Yeah they lost most of my business when they went to 1btc a week instant limit. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 20:41:32
Bitcoin is working. I don't care what the price is. As long as I can transfer value at competitive costs that's what matters to me. I dont care if BTC was at 10 cents.   
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:55:06
I personally hated that scene. The character in question was a complete idiot. I think he even prefaced the Bitcoin investment line with "Duh... I donno maybe Ill invest in Bitcoin." I think the intention of the writers was FUD.  
  
As for price. It would skyrocket.  
@_date: 2016-01-22 14:16:21
Thats brilliant where can I get them?
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:42:13
coinbase. Its not an exchange but I think the safest. Bitstamp is 2nd.choice.

Wearable tech and all the tin foil hat stuff is coming. There is no stopping it. It's just a matter of who controls it. In the future we will have choices. There won't be 1 monolithic entity controlling everything. There won't be 1 currency, 1 blockchain one way of doing things. The old institutions will be disrupted  and they won't be as powerful. They are not going away but they will be weakened.

Between $50-60. It was over priced due to speculators. It will stabilize in the short term once weak hands are out and asics miners and litecoin speculators stop  cashing out. Then it will spike again late in the year or next year when major developments are  announced then the cycle will repeat until the next halving.
@_date: 2013-03-20 13:19:47
It sounds like the Cyprus parliament did not ratify the imf agreement but I think the world is on alert/aware of the potential for a gov bank savings tax. BTC prices will continue to increase. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 14:22:23
Something I learned very quickly from Reddit, Bitcointalk and Butterflylabs forum... someone probably already posted a thread so I better do some research to verify.
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:06:48
between media attention and enthusiasm. We've had media but most of it has been negative and I still have not seen any media piece on a major TV broadcast channel, top anchor or morning show. 
@_date: 2013-01-26 19:18:11
imo it sounds like the bankster propaganda machine is at work. Probably after they collapse the US$ they will announce a US backed world wide digital currency. It will be inferior to bitcoin but will give a huge rise to bitcoin as the concept of digital currency becomes part of everyday language. 
@_date: 2013-07-24 19:21:12
I think its too early to say that they will permanently shun btc. I do think they want to discourage mainstream use until they can accumulate a substantial inventory, Then to the moon.

Its a perfect storm Cyprus, Etoro and Coinlab. Get your seat belts on!
@_date: 2013-06-23 19:26:17
Don't give up until you figure it out. If it helps there are lots of very savvy bitcoiners that have also lost coins for one reason or another. Max Keiser admitted to having lost most of his coins early on. Also the guys from podcast "let's talk bitcoin" mentioned they lost a chunk. I myself lost about 50. Point is don't give up keep the faith and hold for the "Looongest time" it will pay off in the long run. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 02:34:08

That's an interesting point and yeah eventually to get the masses on board it may require some bullshit mainstream lights and whistles. I come from a internet marketing background and all I do is sell to people online. For me that rough looking unpolished look is what attracted me. If my 1st exposure would of been slick graphics and marketing speak I would of run the other way. Everyone has there own bullshit detector mine is slick marketing.

For localbitcoin seller does not need to be in your area. There are many forms of payment; bank cash deposit, western union, moneygram, moneypak and more. Just make sure seller has high positive feedback and more important that the coins are in escrow before you make or send the payment. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 17:12:55

I've been encouraging my personal training clients to get into bitcoin by offering my services at a 50% discount. All my prices are in dollars,  but they save if they pay in bitcoin. It requires me to take time out and sit down with them and create a wallet with them. Then I sell them bitcoins at the mtgox price plus 1%. I find otherwise most people are not motivated enough to do it themselves. My ROI is not more bitcoins because I could easily just purchase bitcoins when they pay me in fiat. Instead my hope is we can gain a new soldier in our battle.

Yes apple has been a great innovator but not anymore. When they started to delete bitcoin apps that send/receive coins then its time to reconsider your loyalties. I know its hard to look at your mentor or your bread butter and say "I'm mad as hell and im not going to take it anymore". I use to promote nike and made alot of money doing it  but I'm done with that. These are difficult times and there is no grey area. We have to decide if we want things to continue as if or if its time to disrupt the grandpa's that have squandered the wealth of our nation and of future generations.

I dont think bitcoin will be for the masses anytime soon because of the digital divide. I have friends and family that do not even know what paypal is. They are poor and are scared of change. I think BTC will be a niche technology that will eventually become prohibitively expensive for the average person to obtain because of institutional investments and high wealth individuals buying them up. The good news is if this does happen we will be extremely wealthy.

So in Europe only the state and criminals have a monopoly on self defense? That's probably why they are raiding your bank accounts and are imposing austerity measures. Remember liberty comes before morality, i.e. a free people are naturally a moral people. But people forced into state or religious morality will rebel. If you put morality and security before liberty you will have neither as they do in Europe.

"The practical misconception here — and it’s a big one — is the notion that we live in an era of wildly irresponsible money printing, with runaway inflation just around the corner. It’s true that the Federal Reserve and other central banks have greatly expanded their balance sheets — but they’ve done that explicitly as a temporary measure in response to economic crisis. I know, government officials are not to be trusted and all that, but the truth is that Ben Bernanke’s promises that his actions wouldn’t be inflationary have been vindicated year after year, while goldbugs’ dire warnings of inflation keep not coming true."

Nah this scenario sounds weak. 
1. 3 letter agencies already know or can access any data on any individual or group they want (unless its tor) with out putting up a small front like a asics seller. They are already scanning and storing every email, google search, social media posts, text message and phone call. 
2. 3 letter agencies already have black budgets that are funded by the and the lions share of illicit drug profits, insider stock trading, precious metal market manipulation etc. The profit from a BTC pump and dump is to small compared, for example to the poppy fields of Afghanistan. Which by the way have increased at least 5x since the US invasion. 
3. I don't think 3 letter agencies are interested in destroying BTC not yet anyway. On the contrary its a new technology and I think they will want to control it through regulations at least until they have their gov sanctioned digital currency. What I wonder is if they will issue a gov digital currency before or after the coming economic collapse
