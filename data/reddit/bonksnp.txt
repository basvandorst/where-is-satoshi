Awesome! Thanks!

Ehh, maybe. But it's done on several very popular designs on much more well known t-shirt sites, so I doubt they'll waste much time with someone who's design somewhat resembles theirs.

Not yet. This is only a few days old and I still have a few bugs to work out. Hopefully it'll pick up when I get some more shirts online.     
    
Edit: Correction! Received my first order this morning and they, appropriately, used Bitcoin for payment. :)

As someone who has kids in Jr High, I'm guessing that while there may be some truth to your story, you probably left a lot of details out that would probably make most of us say, "oh...well that's a *little* different than what you original said".
We're you talking when you weren't supposed to be taking or already told to stop talking (not about bitcoin but just in general)?
We're you discussing or mentioning anything that had to do with illegal drugs?
I know teachers and schools have dumb policies sometimes, but I'd be very surprised if that's the whole story.

Where theres a will, theres a way.  
If something is worth anything and is out on the web, people will try to steal it.  The more widespread it is, the bigger target it will have on it's back.  I don't know how many times PayPal has been compromised, but I'm sure it's not a friendly statistic.
But you're right about one thing.  Non-Savvy users should not use this currency.  At least not the way it is now.  Not because they will get their coins stolen (which they probably will), but because they will find it difficult to use and be turned off from it.  Which is almost as bad as them using it and getting some coins stolen.
For the currency to gain popularity, it has to offer some benefit that other forms of currency do not.  Of course we all know that Bitcoin does have it's legitimate benefits, but to John and Suzy Q, it's way to complicated.  The benefits dont outweigh the complexity of getting setup and therefore will prove unpopular.  Unfortunately our society, IMO, is growing more and more careless, lazy and all around gullible. Unless we figure out a way to make it easier for "normal" people to use, I don't know if it will gain much popularity outside of the enthusiast circle.

I was using PayPal as an example, not comparing it directly to Bitcoins.  hence the two sentences before the one you quoted.


Care to elaborate on this?  Because the interface to blockchain.info is not completely understanding how to use bitcoins.


I assume you're being sarcastic here, but I don't even understand what your point is.
