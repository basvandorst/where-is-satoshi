So what you're saying is a Bitcoin transaction can be overridden if you pay a higher fee after you've made a transaction of same amount.?  That doesn't sound right. 
If I want to double spend some money and fake a transaction that all I have to do is not put a Block fee on the first transaction?  That sounds wrong.

This is why companies have pr departments and don't speak directly to the public through reddit accounts. Should have read about it before writing that line.  What else directly trade related are they not paying attention to while handling everyone's money? 
Edit : since this is getting traction I'd like to say something.   Armstrong, you're a ceo of a huge bitcoin marketplace, with thousands of customers handling millions of dollars of other peoples money and HUGE transaction volume.  Why would you ever respond like this?  I get the whole be on the level of the people thing,  but even then your statement should have been along the lines of "we'll look into it."   what compelled you to write this before googling it? This just seems so out of left field for coinbase.  I'm equally confused by your lack of knowledge as I am your kneejerk response without vetting an answer.   You're in the big leagues man,  shit like this will be quoted on bitcoin news sites and the like.  Direct interaction with the public without at least one pr guy or lawyer near you is playing with fire. 
Not saying this will necessarily loose you users, but it sure as hell isn't gaining you any. Thanks for talking with your user base, but be careful with that power. Dumb statements have destroyed bitcoin marketplaces in the past. Better to be safe. 
If you can't keep track of the issues the groups you associate with are agreeing with, maybe you should hold back on associating with them.

Surprisingly cheap means in the realm of a few million to mess up the network. Those two (and others) didn't spend large chunks of their fortune clogging everything up.  Seriously it is a paltry amount when you consider the tens of trillions in the banking market.
I want bitcoin to succeed as much as any hodler.  Your last point is solid. But right now a few million can easily mess up the network. Imagine what a few billion could do. And a billion is a few to the large bankers/ govs that might want it to fail. The biggest players in banking is what you need to look at, because it takes only a few transactions for them to move into being the biggest players in bitcoin. It's not like this is some private club. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:53:11
In other words attacks are surprisingly cheap in so a few people can basically change fees of the block chain as a whole at will to unsustainable amounts. Now imagine if a few bigger players took a swing.
This needs to be fixed.

Did you miss the part where fees have been absurd over the last few weeks / months because of their actions? Just because some miners make bank doesn't mean the network is more stable.  If anything it brings people in expecting a pay day only to have them get burned, which down the road increases doubt. 
We need stability more than anything for mainstream adoption.

Why would you keep that 100 laying around. I mean that 1000 is probably safe. Better keep that 10k locked up. 
Joking aside, there's tons of people that bought a couple or a dozen when it was lower, and now have a hundred thousand+ asset just sitting on a piece of paper in their house, uninsured and unsecured. Fire, robberies, et cet it's simply unsafe.  For many over the last few years it literally went from a couple bucks to tens of thousands, and people are people. They're lazy. 
You wouldn't keep your Ira or life savings or retirement account in cash just laying around. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:32:44
I figure a market crash could take it away, at least a bit, but if you're planning for your retirement you over plan, like 4 mil for 2 people at 4%. It's at least double what any couple would need. If the whole economy fails hard enough to destroy 4mil invested in safe bets, we have bigger problems to worry about. Like the thunder dome.
A more realistic retirement would be 1.5-2 at 5%. But we're young so whatever. Shits gonna change. Shit always changes.

The bitcoin symbol and name is quickly becoming one of the most known symbols in the world, with a market cap nearing the world's biggest companies. I'd like to think that the logo is doing just fine. Plus, it doubles as it's currency symbol. It does its job exactly as it should, and is just boring and unique enough.

I'm not saying don't ever trust others, just that people trust others especially family, all the time and get screwed over. There's an infinite number of cases where family screws over family.

With this fast a rise I'm suprised honestly it's leveling off at 14 so quickly. Get back to me when it hits under 10k.
This last rise was huge market cap wise. Only happened because of HUGE spenders, the kind that don't drop out on a whim. Remember bitcoin just added a hundred billion to its price this month. Mom and pop didn't buy coins to cause this, and I think that point is being lost on a  lot of people who saw the last bubbles. This isn't a bubble. This is old money joining in the party. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:57:15
Not to mention I highly doubt home owners or renters insurance is going to cover bitcoin in case of loss or theft.

Every iteration on your site has bitcoin written next to it in clear letters.  Why? Because it's unrecognizable by default without. No reason to fix what isn't broken. No reason to add confusion to an already confusing and fragile ecosystem where other coins are trying to steal the symbol known worldwide as bitcoin.

But voting on renewing the Patriot Act wasn't on today's agenda. its delaying something but the actual renewal of the Patriot Act is not being delayed.

Also, from your own article "However, some analysts challenge estimates of the size of the derivatives market as vastly overstated.  ...  When actual market value of derivatives, rather than notional value, is the focus, the estimate of the size of the derivatives market changes dramatically."
You do understand you can't liquidate the derivatives market for $ right? Like filling every contract?  Many assets have multiple derivatives. Its why its not included when measuring true global wealth.
SO - ". Gross market value of all outstanding derivatives was $14.5 trillion at the end of 2007, less than one-fortieth of the $596 trillion estimate. (That number shrinks to about $3.3 trillion once you take into account contracts that directly offset one another.)"

I was working of the idea that a 5.8 million coin value would carry over to 21 million coins. The numbers the paper is suggesting is if the entire broad money supply instantly transfered to bitcoin right now. 
The paper is shit, the article is shit, and these numbers are all made up. Change my 121 trillion to 95, all my arguments still stand.

121 trillion valuation? No. I truly believe it will hit 100 or 500k. But this is just silly.  
Edit: 121 trillion was based on 21mil coins. 88T is still insane, to assume it could take over the wealth of the broad money supply. Not to mention the chart in the article goes on to suggest 10-20mil value coins.

Also, we're at an all time high. This may end up being a low. But generally it's smart to wait for a bit of a dip. 
That being said, we've all missed a ton of dips. 
It's best to buy slowly over time, to average your gains and losses. If OP has 3K today, I'd suggest buying 20 a week over the next 30 weeks, and investing the other 80 in other stocks and commodities in the same fashion.

Print to a paper wallet. From a 1960s tape computer. Re-record over the tape with Frasier reruns. Then refilm Office Space and use the printer you printed your paper wallet from to recreate the printer smashing scene. 
OK so now you've got your paper wallet. Time to get serious. Rewrite it in a lost language. Pick something at least 5000 years old, and make sure to use an Enigma machine for the encoding before you burn everything and make the hieroglyphic carvings of your private key. 
Now this part is tricky. Pair up with NASA and Elon to make voyager 3.  The hard part is going to get Kate Mulgrew to revisit her role as captain Janeway and loose that shit in the most distant part of the delta quadrant.

You clearly don't understand max value vs nominal value.  If we measured the world's worth in btc sure, btc is worth that much. But that's not how things work.   Measuring the world in btc doesn't make btc worth that much.  Btc is only worth what it's bought for. It will never be bought for 5 million.   
Sorry you didn't buy in sooner.  
Edit: there is a way btc is worth 5 mil a coin, and it's that the usd is worth less. In which case, your btc doesn't have more purchasing power, usd just failed. Congrats you have 5 mil coins, where the usd is severely lower valued.   Overall purchasing power remains the same.

For some context. How's this: the total estimated wealth of all assets on earth is estimated to be around 250 trillion. That's including all businesses, all buildings, all land. How could bitcoin become nearly half of all of that?  There isn't that much wealth in all the banks on the planet, in all currencies. 
If bitcoin completely replaced EVERY SINGLE CURRENCY on earth today, it wouldn't be worth that.   In fact, it would be worth about half of that, 60 trillion. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:23:13

@_date: 2017-08-05 00:40:16
These are very different numbers, I think you have them mixed up.
60T is a rough estimation of the Broad currency supply, ie ALL the money in the world, not including assets. (anywhere from 50-80T depending on who you ask)
250T is the estimate of all currency, assets, land, et cet.
121T is bitcoin mined out to 21mil coins, valued at 5.8 million per coin.
GDP of the world, aka GWP is estimated at 100-110T.  This was simply a number for context of how large $121T is
So if you converted the entire broad money supply to bitcoin, eliminating all other currencies, you'd only have ~60T in value, and at either 16mil coins (current) or 21mil coins (furture) you still dont have $5.8mil per coin.  Without crazy inflation fudging the numbers in the future, $5.8mil coins are literally impossible.
edit:  unless every coin holder suddenly set their sell price to 5.8 million for no apparent reason, and refused any less.

I never said they don't and I never said it doesn't.  What I'm saying is that if a lawsuit did come about, differing the code helps their argument.  The problem lies in that if voat gets big, and conde nast sees this as a problem, they can sue, and if they do, voat would probably stand no chance, if they didn't have the small differences.
Even with the differences, the cost of a lawsuit would probably ruin then, if they weren't based in a totally different country.

Even though it's open source, you can sue for pretty much anything.  Style, design, code, et cet. Even if voat was in the right, a lawsuit with that much $ behind it against 2 guys would shut it down almost instantly.  Differing the code helps to distance them a little bit more legally
@_date: 2015-07-05 05:06:45
Avoiding a lawsuit for one, but also a myriad of other small reasons, most likely that the voat guys know other languages better, wish to implement things differently, and maybe that they just wanted a challenge and didn't expect the traffic so fast.

It would obviously be disclosed and become a norm, and use minimal resources of the user on the other end. When you're talking billions of machines you're not over stressing any end user. You're trying to get fractions of a cent from each user.
Given the choice of mine a little, watch ads, or block all and deny revenue to sites I enjoy, I'd rather mine. In the end I don't believe it'd be enough to damage end users computers. If it was, I'd be against it.
As it is video and other ads are already doing this. They're using your resources as is, but not giving any profit back to site owners. Every video ad is chewing up far more resources than mining would, and at a lower payout to both parties.
You're already using your processing time to play their shit ads.

For brave, if you allow the end user to decide, you'd need an opt out, not an opt in. Nobody is going to donate unless you set a minimum, it's human nature. Not to mention anyone less tech savvy is going to go for no payments by default.
I think what I'm suggesting is a solid replacement for that. In theory their method would work, if people wern't greedy, and realized a few fractions of a penny of processing time is less than paying a dollar a month to their favorite sites.  They're relying on a minority. 
Tldr, if you rely on the generosity of the end user, you're going to get a skewed revenue stream that doesn't directly reflect site views.
A site should gain revenue based on total bandwidth sent, not user savvyness.

@_date: 2018-02-14 09:56:00
Most people however, don't block things. I block as well, but wouldn't if this were the case.
As to the second point, I think it would be beneficial to implement this system, but to also have all sites using the new revenue stream to agree to an implementation of this system that finds a balance. One that doesn't hurt end users but also pays out enough to site owners. Considering all sites are viewed through a handful of browsers, you'd only have to have them agree to allow the main implementation of this idea, and block all the rest.
Users wouldn't use the one that didn't. If Firefox, Chrome, ie, and opera blocked sites breaking a threshold, gaming the system wouldn't work.

Yeah I'd hate to ask, but how terminal OP? You got a few months? Ooh... You got a few years? Ehhh...  
Also who gets your debt? They're gonna hate you in the short run but if you stop them from selling it for a few years they might thank you. 
Might.

I kept some on there for spending purposes. Not a lot,  but some.

Like, most major exchanges in the past. Shitty track record there for a while.

Have fun with that.  As it stands, nobody posting makes (bar the adverts) money from karma, yet they still spam ALL DAY LONG.  Power users will be the norm, posting *shit* all day long.You're just asking for shit karma whoring content with this model.  Now say all day how you'll stop it, and realize reddit, one of the top sites, cant stop it.  How the hell will they?  ( a smaller site)

Reddit is 10 years old, still hasn't solved this problem.  (and why would they when it brings them ad revenue.)  Want more?  Lets go with a paying model.

I kept $30 ish worth on my phone in case I came across a place that accepted it. You just use the Mycelium qr code to spend it

About a year and a half ago I opened a cryptsy account to buy coins, I haven't checked that an account in a long time should I attempt to shut it down? (Serious.) I always thought they were one of the better more reputable sites

What's the safest way to move to an off chain wallet?

Because the daily theft on the streets of cash $ does not exist, right?

Switched phones a while back, did the same thing. Only lost like 50$ usd but still felt like an idiot as I realized it right after I mailed it back to the carrier.

Regulated companies would prevent things from going full GOX all the time.  Not to mention insurance for said companies so if coins get "lost" those who had coins on said markets then could then at least get paid out in full. 
It's a grey area for sure, but something does have to be done. Not to mention the money laundering problem and the tumblers using a ton of block chain bandwidth. 
We still have a lot of growing to do. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 02:10:19
What I mean by regulated is up to a decent standard so they can be insured by major insurers. This is key, so that **no matter what happens** your money is safe. 
A lot of people I've told about bitcoin won't try to get into it bc they think/know how unsafe and hard it is to keep your coins properly stored.      
Security of the code is not the same as security of insured assets. No matter the codes strength, if it's insured by a major group that can handle all the losses of a failed exchange, it's safe to the consumer.    
Bitcoin exchanges should have the same level of insurance coverage as major stock exchange groups.  
Edit: remember, no one's stopping anyone from running an unregulated market. That's the beauty of bitcoin.  It literally can't be stopped. Do it aaaaallllllll you want. But don't be suprised if a regulated insured one gets big.     
@_date: 2013-12-23 02:33:59
Except no one would knowingly do that. For that exact reason.
Edit - realized this isnt op.  took out name calling.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:33:53
Honest opinion?   It's hideous.  I wouldn't wear one, and I'd probably laugh at someone who did.  It's just poor style and in poor taste.  Think of people with dollar sign shirts.  That square clashes with the round of the coin as well.
@_date: 2016-07-01 23:53:49
Do they give 6% back on groceries and 3% back on gas, with 1% on everything else?   Because until I get these discounts in day to day life with btc I have no reason to switch. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:58:26
go away troll.
@_date: 2013-12-23 08:47:06
God dammit I had a decent paragraph written, now it got erased.  
TLDR - near 0 chance of happening without malicious intent.  Owner of coin wouldn't want to risk loosing possible profit, who would?  Yes it could happen, but even if it did, it would bounce back, and the pool would be more decentralized.  Not to mention it would be near impossible for someone to dump that volume of coins before market halts were put in place.
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:21:37
See in other spots in this thread you say youre not fear mongering,  yet here you are.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:02:23
Yes but where are you going to cash out?
@_date: 2013-12-23 03:01:14
With the age of those coins and the extreme volume/value, IT IS NOT A POSSIBILITY, as anyone in possesion of that much old coin would have no reason to destroy the price.
EDIT:  Thought this was op, my mistake. got rid of the name calling.
