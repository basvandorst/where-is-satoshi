Doesn't mean a thing if they don't exchange crypto for fiat.

Nothing is different, it's just volatile. This is following all of the stages of a bubble. The idea behind cryptocurrency is solid so it will continue to grow over time, but there's a lot of speculation going on so this is to be expected. Basically they're tanking because they all skyrocketed, and a lot of people are just trying to make a quick buck. That's just the impact of all the speculation going on.

Saying that about a far left sub with hardcore far left mods bent on promoting a hardcore far left message is not that broad of a brush. I got banned for saying I want to fix up a house for people to live in. My crime was wanting passive income from a hobby. Some of the commenters and lurkers there probably have no problem with that, but that's pure speculation because anything outside of what the mods agree with is rigorously censored. They have a problem with anyone who wants to own private property. My brush is like...one bristle compared to theirs. Nice try though.
Also, crypto is pretty much a free market. It's not an example of leftist ideology, especially not the type found in r/LSC.

Got banned for saying I wanted to fix up and rent out an old house someday in a thread about evil landlords. The reason the mods gave me was all landlords are leeches. It's not just rich people, they hate everyone except maybe homeless people.

Stable genius is a facetious term describing someone who is narcissistic, lashes out with anger, lacks self awareness, and shows clear signs of dementia.
You'd have to be a big stupid idiot dummy not to know that.

Uh huh, sure. He's probably just repeating stuff his dad said to him.

No, shhh, we must have our daily two minutes panic about the debt. People don't want to know things are fine. Don't explain to us how it works, we don't want to understand. We crave an impending apocalypse.

Yes that actually makes perfect sense.

It's currently unusable as a currency. The big lightning network fix that's taking forever to roll out barely improves the transaction speed. It's also going to consume increasingly ridiculous amounts of energy and computing power. Crypto will be around but Bitcoin is probably the AOL of crypto. 
Edit: I guess these are sensitive subjects around here. Sorry for chiming in on OP's big pep talk. Go get em tigers. Bitcoin is totally gonna take down Wall Street and the global banks.

No need to get upset. Might be time to get up and move around a bit.

Get on Coinbase Pro and set a stop loss. It's free. Pro is way better and lets you set an automatic sell point. Mine is currently trailing the price by 5%. If the price plummets suddenly and triggers my stop loss I'll at least have more USD than I started with. 
These markets are not regulated and people will straight up rob you if you don't take precautions. Limit your losses and protect your gains, and give the price some wiggle room but not so much that a big dip wipes you out. Play it safe while you're learning. I'm no expert but the USD value of my holdings has increased by about 27% over the past week. Which means nothing because any idiot could do that during a bull run. My point is I'm protecting it in case it drops by 70% while I'm asleep. You can't do that on Coinbase and the price alerts don't always work either. Also their fees are really high compared to Pro. 
It doesn't matter what you use. People are super snobby about their exchange preferences in crypto, and the more popular something is, the more redditors are going to trash it. That being said, the basic Coinbase app actually is shit. Coinbase Pro (new version of GDAX) would be a vast improvement, and it's really easy(also less expensive) to make the switch.
