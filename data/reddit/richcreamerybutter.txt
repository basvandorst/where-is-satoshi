It's true, I mean everyone I've ever met who earned $500k+ only worked like 20 hours a week, the rest of the time they spent with family. That's how they got that salary in the first place! /s
I don't know why it's so hard for Reddit to see wealthy people as real humans who can also have major challenges, depression, and poor work/life balance. Not everyone is jetskiing with Tony Hawk and banging models 24/7, JFC. "Haha but they're rich so \*Woody Harrelson .gif\*." The majority of millionaires are people you'd never suspect and people you've never heard of. Not everyone is Paris Hilton.

Doing worse is relative, of course. They will be doing worse financially. They may be doing better in terms of work/life balance. You can be happier and also make a lot less money. Unless your entire sense of self worth is tied to your income, in which case yeah you'll just be more depressed. 
Money removes stress from things like "how will I pay my bills?" There is a large middle ground between "wealthy" and "can't afford to pay bills." Not sure why that is rarely acknowledged here.

They do but they probably also aren't on instagram 8 hours a day like a bunch of my friends, looking at lives they wish they were living instead. ;)

Also, people in 3rd world countries don't have a constant flood of Reddit posts and reality shows telling them how worthless and shitty their lives are unless they're living it up as millionaires. So naturally they're going to be happier.
