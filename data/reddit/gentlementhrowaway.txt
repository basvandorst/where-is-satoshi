Uhh.... Stealing is always against the law, so... Just because a market for something is unregulated, that doesn't make all crime involving that thing legal or acceptable.

WTF is wrong with you? A lot of people want minimal to no regulation for bitcoin, but that doesn't mean that they should be okay with being stolen from. No regulation does not = straight up theft being legal and acceptable.

Sometimes we loves him, sometimes we hates him, but he's always entertaining to say the least.

We can (if we're optimistic) look at what happened to the gold price when gold ETFs went live. People who wanted to invest in gold, but didn't have an avenue to do so (with their retirement accts) were previously relegated to physical gold purchases, which was cumbersome on many levels (procurement; storage; security; etc). Once the gold ETFs went live, people were able to move 401k/IRA funds into "gold". The market price of physical gold rose along with the ETF price, if I'm not mistaken. I would think that there's a fair amount of existing bitcoin enthusiasts with retirement accounts that will allocate funds towards GBTC that would otherwise be unavailable for bitcoin exposure. Also, I think there's a fair amount of people that previously would have had bitcoin if procurement, storage, and security wasn't such a pain in the ass. I expect the value of bitcoin (the currency) to appreciate alongside with the bit shares.

Generally speaking, if there's demand for the bit and the price is higher than the equivalent for bitcoin, the price should follow suit. Market value is market value dude.

Well, you're entitled to your opinion. We'll see what happens ♥
