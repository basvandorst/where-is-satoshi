I didn't say it was yours. I just said I hate those channels. 
Also it took me like 20 seconds to go find this: 
Sorry your shitty post failed. Thanks for downvoting me though.

I liked this video, but I hate these youtube channels that are obviously just reposting other people's content in an attempt to make money from views. OH LOOK THE USER HAS A GIRLS NAME AND A PICTURE OF A HOT WOMAN AS THE AVATAR. =/

Yeah someone else came back to this random post that's been deleted for 4 days and found your comment at the bottom of this thread and upvoted you. It's not an alt account of yours.
(I admit it's possible, but you have to admit it seems rather unlikely)

Don't worry if you keep downvoting me you'll eventually feel better.
@_date: 2014-04-30 19:47:06
Thanks again. :]

10 reasons why people love lists.

Nah It's cool. I was trying to advise you while not being a dick. It's just one of those things that I've gotten in the habit of doing and so it bothers me a little when other people don't. Just an irrational Pet Peeve.

Use incognito or clear your cache/cookies then try again. Worked for me. 
Also search before making new threads. This is the 4th in 2 hours, and you would have seen the answer in one of the others. NBD, just keep it in mind.

Yeah I was just thinking if I could start getting my friends to pay me back for things in bitcoins....

Maybe there are better threads to ask this in, but how do business use Bitcoins typically? I mean the value fluctuates sometimes up or down Hundreds of Dollars in a single day. Do they pick a price for the day? Or do they actively adjust the price based off of the current btc/usd value throughout the day? So I mean... could someone wait for the value to peak and then buy more with the same amount of BTC?

Makese sense. So if the Store sets the Price in USD then Coinbase(or whoever) just uses their current price to do the conversion? So theoretically you could spend less bitcoins if you wait for a surge in their value. That's kinda neat.
