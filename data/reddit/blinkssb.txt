Sorry about my middle paragraph lol I was just making a point for everyone not specifically against you. But the rest of it is kinda against you and anyone who thinks Bitcoin has no intrinsic value but other material objects do. 
I don’t know the Finance definition of intrinsic value but the regular definition of intrinsic value is: valuable in and of itself. 
You’re saying (and a lot of people are saying) that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, so it’s not valuable in and of itself.
However you seem to imply that gold is intrinsically valuable. So Gold is valuable in and of itself according to you (unless you’re using a special Finance definition).
Yet at the same time you say that Gold is only valuable as a means for Jewellery and Science. That to me means it’s not intrinsically valuable. Rather, it’s valuable only insofar as it is a means to another end.
My point is that Bitcoin is the same as all of these other physical things people claim to have intrinsic value. Other things are just means to an end just like Bitcoin is.

You can’t separate value from perception. Gold is only useful insofar as humans find uses for it. “Jewelry”, “science”, these mean nothing unless humans perceive such things as useful. If humans, via custom, perceived grey stone rocks as useful for jewellery then we’d be wearing those around our necks. Science? Lots of things can be used for scientific research. 
If, tomorrow, everyone on earth agreed fuck dollar bills, they mean nothing, they literally would just be pieces of paper and the only way to survive would be whether you owned artillery or were strong physically or smart enough to dissuade people from killing you or taking your stuff. People who say it’s “backed by the government therefore it’s valuable”...do you not realize that it is the government pulling the wool over your eyes in their defining for you what things have “objective value”? Please open your eyes. 
Bitcoin is valuable so long as people perceive it as valuable. It is the leading and most well known cryptocurrency in the world which can be used today for transactions related to goods and services. Are the transaction fees high? Yes, but afaik people are developing the technology to improve it. Are countries trying to ban it? Yes, because they want to control you and Bitcoin means they lose a significant amount of control. However, the above doesn’t mean Bitcoin has no value.

Under this definition, I think it should be explicitly stated to others that this usage of intrinsic value is a technical term.
I think people are seeing “Bitcoin has no intrinsic value” posted and then they conclude therefore that “Bitcoin is worth less than this other thing” under that technical definition, when in actuality it’s just the technical definition that’s creating this disillusionment.

This is a small drop unless you just bought in like a week ago. I bought over a month ago so I’m still in the plus big time. Chicken littles everywhere saying “the sky is falling” will never get rich. Only the men (and woMEN) will prevail.

Yeah pretty much 
@_date: 2018-08-12 13:29:37
So you’re ok if it dropped to 0.0001?
Also, if we’re not allowed to talk about price at all this sub should be renamed to btc-tech or something, since other than price that’s all there’s worth talking about otherwise. If a sub is called “Bitcoin” we should be allowed to talk about “Bitcoin”.

What is gold other than a shiny piece of metal? Of course, so long as there are humans who put a ton of value on shiny pieces of metal, it will be valuable. However, for critically minded individuals, gold is also only subjectively valuable. 
One can then counter by saying it has industrial applications, but other metals may be swappable for gold as well, so unless there are gold-exclusive properties (I’m not a material science major so don’t ask me) such that ONLY gold can be used for a specific USEFUL task/function (I personally haven’t heard of any), you can’t say gold is so intrinsically valuable that it will, guaranteed, forever be strong enough to use a backup for a currency. 
Even if gold was/is used to backup fiat, if you think about it, the same thing could even be applied to crypto if it catches on. Humans just have to agree to it. Crypto, like anything, can be backed by anything, even if that something isn’t gold. Fiat only exists on a different level than crypto when there is government intervention and mandatory usage by force. But crypto also has its own level of force via its insanely large support base of people. So I guess we’ll see what happens in the end. It’s definitely an interesting time.

“No one holds USD...further value”
“Bitcoin doesn’t really create any value” 
From the way your points are structured, you seem to imply that somehow the USD can create value in a way that Bitcoin cannot. However, they’re both currencies. Currencies do not create value, they are stores of value, by definition. They are mediums of exchange. 
(Note: Yes, I’m aware some people don’t want to call Bitcoin a currency yet because of fluctuating value relative to the USD. That’s just debating semantics though, because their definition of currency isn’t absolute. Fluctuating value relative to a predominantly operating currency should not make something not a currency, just an unpopular or maybe even just an under-utilized currency at present, which could at any time, depending on the people involved, become the most popular currency).
Bitcoin is -money-. If Bitcoin ever gets adopted sufficiently enough [which it should so that banks (i.e. some people) don’t rule us all, and instead, we (all people) do], it would simply replace the currently prevailing top currency being used. Then yes, we’ll be buying houses, food, and smartphones with Bitcoin. 
Afterward, it would not matter at that point whether Bitcoin as a currency appreciates or depreciates since everyone (or the vast majority of the world) would be using it as the predominant currency to buy things. However, the US dollar, if it continued to become worth less and less compared to Bitcoin due to more slowly and slowly not being used, would in a sense be Bitcoin “appreciating”. Such would not be caused just by “speculation” but by a conversion. The conversion being the majority of people crowning a new currency King. 
It should be up to the majority of people in the world, not the small few who hold positions of power, to determine which currency should reign supreme. And it’s sad if people are choosing the USD out of fear of government, and/or ignorance of the concepts involved. 
Of course, we need to buy stuff today and so we can’t toss out all our USD in the toilet right away. But the -trend- should be adoption of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 04:27:51
An interesting thought I had today: let’s say Bitcoin one day becomes the number one predominant currency in the world over the USD. What this would imply is that all other currencies determine their value via comparison to Bitcoin rather than the USD.
Seems trivial, but here’s the consequence:
We would then not say things like “Bitcoin dip again...” or “Bitcoin is skyrocketing!” 
Rather, we’d say things like:
“The USD has dropped again today and is worth next to nothing (100,000 US Dollars for ONE Bitcoin?!?!)” 
or 
“The USD rises again! From 5000 USD for 1 BTC to 4000 USD for 1 BTC!”
I just find how the mere change in rhetoric (depending on which is the prevailing currency) can change the average person’s perspective on things fascinating.

It’s at roughly 8k right now. I’ll say it drops to as low as 5k but reaches a high of 25k. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:21:05
Ah so Bitcoin just dropped because Mt. Gox was trolling the market. That makes more sense. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 04:54:51
Ironically this is what Bitcoin strives to fight against. I hate the decision to be honest. People should be free to spend their money as they like. Freedom, liberty; without that we’re pretty much 1984.

Nah it’ll drop more. 5k will meet some resistance I’d say, but it may even go lower. The floor could be as low as 1k. Any lower than 1k though, this thing is done for.
