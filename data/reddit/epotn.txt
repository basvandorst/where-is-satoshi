I just waited for 24hours for a payment to get confirmed why isn't there a heads up? especially if youre running core as your default client

I feel ya, that really sux, its annoying too that bitcoin core doesn't just tell you that your fee is too low, I mean like I don't know how many bytes the tx is?

**How much should it cost someone to run a full node? What’s the highest price we’re OK with?**


**Does Bitcoin have a social contract? If so what is it, and how much weight should we give it?**


**How should we trade off risks to decentralization vs. other things? (Be sure to click through to both links if you find yourself upset by this question.)**


**What is the likely trajectory of Bitcoin’s adoption and price, and how do both of those factors change and affect each other given different maximum block size limits?**


**How quickly will the costs of bandwidth/storage/computing power likely fall in the future?**


**Should we avoid keeping fees low now even if we can do so safely, so users don’t get the wrong expectations for the future?**


**How important is the “Fidelity problem” as described in this video by Jeff Garzik?**


**Is adoption more important in the early stages of Bitcoin’s growth than its later stages, because of money’s network effects?**


**Are controversial hard forks a legitimate method of Bitcoin governance? In this post, Greg Maxwell suggests controversial hard forks are close to theft. Others believe they are completely legitimate.**


**How will users, businesses, and investors most likely react to a controversial hard fork?**

The part I don't understand is who cares about the chinese miners? mining is self-balancing? why would they care about the blocksizes?

I can only imagine how much they must hate bitcoin

I don't get why people don't use their own private wallet (hopefully backed up) as an intermediary?
