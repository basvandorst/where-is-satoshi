Sounds like $30-$60 of electricity per transaction being put to good use.
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:24:21
What does the amount transacted have to do with energy consumption? There's no difference between mining a block with 1000 20 BTC transactions versus 1000 0.01BTC transactions in terms of the amount of hashes required to solve the hash puzzle.
The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index's model is in line with the projected growth based on ASIC production, if you scroll down a bit. It tells you exactly what the assumptions were behind the model and where it gets its calculations from and where the strengths/weaknesses are, so I think you're probably way off.
EDIT: in summary, even if you can't convince everyone to turn their lights off at night, persuading them to use a technology that actually requires enormous amounts of electricity for the sake of security is much, much harder. It might be worth it if they gain some relief transaction time or ease of use compared to what we have already, which Bitcoin has neither.

You've missed the point entirely, and made the mistake of the other guy here and suggested that we should simply take the planet's resources hostage and keep being inefficient until someone thinks of something better. 69.1 TWH for such a small throughput is significant.
So seriously, what's left to talk about?
- We're still 3400x less efficient per transaction than VISA.
- This includes branch and office costs, server costs and other costs.
- The cost of electricity per transaction isn't factored in to the BTC fee.
- We're relying on tech that doesn't necessarily solve the energy consumption problem, if anything it will continue to grow exponentially, regardless of whether demand stays the same or increases (or drops.)
- The same tech reduces the level of security which essentially puts you back in the same ballpark as current systems, but at a much, much greater energy consumption overall and a much, much higher cost, reducing it's utility even further.
- There is a significant opportunity cost to not mining BTC, regardless of how valuable miners and exchanges perceive it to be.
Basically, it's "stick with BTC and wait and see." Which isn't good enough.

I don't believe that for a second. Considering that VISA can process hundreds of thousands of transactions using a [fraction of the energy]( required for Bitcoin to process one transaction \(even when you factor in the energy required for office buildings etc\) I can't imagine what level of adoption the BTC network requires to even come close to the efficiency centralised system.
Walk through this with me. If I understand what you are saying, then if the amount of transactions on the BTC network increased 100 times overnight and the hash rate didn't change then the amount of energy consumed per transaction becomes 1&amp; of today's value. But then you have a scenario where the network is crippled with congestion and stupidly high fees. So more miners come in and contribute to the hash rate because it's more profitable, but  neither problem is fixed from simply more people mining because the mining difficulty changes. Now your energy consumed per transaction just starts to go back up again, plus you have a congested network, plus high fees. This doesn't work.
Even if the adoption increase is gradual, more miners would come in a BTC becomes more profitable to mine, contributing to the hash rate and thus increasing the energy consumer per transaction, or at the very least keeping it constantly high.

I'm not playing to emotion, it's supplying context to a figure (68.8TWh) which would otherwise be hard to understand, especially in a world which is trying to be less wasteful and more green. 
The country comparison is completely reasonable, because we can measure the relative outputs of the Czech Republic and Bitcoin. 
I picked water because it's a comparable natural resource. The very system that is supposed to be providing a net positive benefit to everyone, right now, would (in my opinion) actually do more by being turned off, because the of the opportunity cost of using that money to invest in projects that directly solve the problems of poor sanitation and clean water. 
When more people start using it for the actual purpose it was intended to be for (other than just trading for other currencies) and when it starts to demonstrate real scale then then I might reconsider my position.

Fair enough, but it's still not a great choice for a merchant. The risk that a transaction that never confirms or the customer attempting to double spend isn't really something any merchant would chance when the payment systems they have already ensure some level of insurance.
And yes, a bit of a random comparison, but energy consumption is for sure something you'd consider as a merchant as well as user of the system. It's the first thing people think of now when they hear about BTC.
In the best case your 12-minute, $0.30 transaction also cost the Earth the equivalent energy to a US household for a month. It simply doesn't get more efficient with more transactions either, because any scenario where it becomes more profitable to mine results in an increase in the overall hashrate. It just doesn't make sense.

[Not right now, no.]( Only $0.73 for the highest fee.


Sure, the mining revenues are higher than the energy costs. I'm not disputing that. I'm saying the opportunity cost of burning nearly 0.5% of the world's energy for a measly 3-7 transactions per second with 12 minute confirmation times is pretty high compared to what we have already.


The demand from who? Miners? Sure. From the general public to actually use Bitcoin? Absolutely not.

OK, [Stellar is implementing LN too]( and the deadline is by December this year. Based on your argument, does this mean Stellar will be secure when it is ready to process millions of transactions? If so, why would I pay a premium for a more secure transaction on the BTC network when I can pay 0.0001XLM for greater security? 
If not, then why should I believe your argument that X technology should be secure before it can used on the Lightning Network? Because "proof of work"? Which takes us all the way back to the beginning, of "why would I use BTC at the cost of the Earth to secure a transaction which is already secure enough with current fiat systems at a fraction of the cost?"

If you're not happy with the per transaction figure then you can always check the projected total mining costs for the year, which comes to about $3.4b, which is the equivalent cost of supplying clean water for 2.3% of the world for a year.
Or that the entire network's consumption is the same as the energy consumption of Czech Republic.

My primary concerns aren't with security really, they're with the fact that the original article claimed that Bitcoin consumes significantly less resources than the fiat systems, which is patently false. They're also with that we've been spending a day because you were trying to defend the point with branch costs the like and there's no reasonable evidence to support it.
I went one step further to say that for Bitcoin, even if its original goal was technically successful, in it's current state it is ridiculously wasteful for its throughput. And even lightning can't save it, because not every transaction that would've occurred on the main chain will move to LN, and energy consumption needs to go up exponentially anyway. People will still resort to the main chain and bypass lightning for a lot of reasons. 
Channels will open and close, and the despite fact that lightning will technically reduce the energy produced per transaction, it won't ever match the efficiency of VISA and it will still cost the Earth.
My concerns aren't with security, I know the main chain is secure. I'm saying that securing the chain to make miners and a select group of people slightly richer is not worth the opportunity cost, when there are potentially better technologies out there, and in some cases better causes.
It's also that 69.1 TWH is significant. And that currently, it's not looking like it's going to get any better, and a wait and see attitude is dangerous and patently absurd.

Debatable from a societal and philosophical aspect.

@_date: 2018-05-28 18:53:17


69.1 TWh, and the mining costs alone could pay for [2.3% of the cost to produce clean water for the entire world.]( I'd love to know how many of the transactions are actually responsible for "banking the unbanked" as opposed to middle class Westerners sending BTC to exchanges to buy altcoins to increase their wealth, or mining pools cashing out their BTC to fiat after 100 blocks. I'm fully prepared to be proved wrong on that, just present me some data to show otherwise.


Demonstrating my point that your argument of "X technology will be secure before it can use the lightning network" is nonsense, since I can argue the same for BTC because of the centralisation of mining pools [(look at those three gnarly looking mining pools totaling 52%)]( the fact that Satoshi holds 1m BTC and we simply have to trust him/her/them that they won't flood the market.

Thanks for the information. 
So from what I can tell, no-one knows the private key, which is good. Value is extracted, but in most cases only the full amount in one go, which sucks. You can top it back up, but only to the maximum amount of the note, which also sucks, and seems like an unnecessary restriction.
It is a trade off for sure, I understand that. But I'm not convinced yet, since using fiat cash is still far more convenient:
- I need an internet connection to verify that the account is loaded.
- The physical note looks like a large, chunky thing, far less convenient to handle than actual cash.
- Getting change and lower denominations of notes makes the payment experience even less convenient.

I'm shorting BTC after a year or so of thoroughly believing it. I've absorbed as much of the high quality literature, followed all the dramas and remained as open-minded as I can, and I still feel the same way. There are, and will be more, better alternatives.
Using Bitcoin at the cost of significantly higher fees, much slower confirmation times, the enormous amount of wasted energy to achieve 3-7 transactions per second and the increased inconvenience of managing your own keys, isn't enough to convince me or really most people that it will be used for mass adoption. I know all the counter-arguments of "lightning will fix this", "but freedom" and "all the energy used would otherwise be wasted", but I'm not convinced.
Kindly feel free to try and change my mind, but at this point it's far easier to argue against BTC than it is to argue for the benefits of it in its current state.

The research behind the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index [has already considered this]( and others have [already critiqued it]( and all the other standard BTC responses to energy consumption.  
TL;DR: global banking system is estimated to use 100TWh a year compared to Bitcoin's 51TWh. Bitcoin still requires 3400 times more energy than an average non\-cash transaction.
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:17:01
I'll walk you through this step by step. 
- We started at VISA can process hundreds of thousands of transactions using the same energy that Bitcoin uses to process one. (You're still not acknowledging the 3400x difference per transaction but fine, whatever.)
- You came back with "but costs of keeping office lights and computers on over the weekend when it's closed for business", to which I gave you a figure of 100TWh total for the entire banking system across the world, **including branch costs such as those.**
- The article (at the time of writing) states that Bitcoin was using 28TWh, now it is 69.1TWh, when the network was processing [roughly twice as many transactions as it is now.](
- So halving the transactions for more twice the hash rate cancels out that 3x efficiency gain the article concludes, since the network is now (at least) 1/4 of the efficiency it was when the article was written.
- Just to spell it out, the global banking system has probably increased to processing a few thousand more transactions per bitcoin transaction for a less than proportional increase, since that's how transactions should scale.
EDIT: added stuff. Is this where I act like a dick and start writing "mic drops" and such like?
EDIT2: and you know what? Concluding that the *sum* of the energy consumption for all transactions was a suitable measure of efficiency rather than the *energy spent per transaction* in the hackermoon article makes this all redundant anyway. **3400x more energy than a visa transaction?** I'm surprised you felt comfortable enough mic dropping before I walked you through it all. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 15:45:32
Respectfully, I think you're grasping at straws now.


You're suggesting that the solution to incentivize solving Bitcoin's huge energy consumption problem is to take the planet's resources hostage and keep being inefficient and wasteful until someone thinks of something better. 


If it was the only way to solve the problem of securing a decentralized system then half of the altcoins wouldn't exist. What are you suggesting exactly, that it's the only way? That we shouldn't try and innovate? 
Even if the majority of them haven't really been tested in terms of large scale attacks just yet, the majority of them are secure enough for every day use, at a negligible rate of energy consumption, which will only get more secure as more nodes get added to the network and as the protocols improve (as a rule of thumb.)


The 100 [TWh figure]( factors in the server costs, branch costs and ATM costs for tens of thousands of banks across the world, including the electricity required to maintain their other systems. But the fact that you are resorting to listing as many indirect costs to somehow justify Bitcoin requiring thousands of times more energy per transaction looks a bit desperate. 
If we want to play that game, then we could apply those same costs of civil and criminal disputes, office costs, CRM system and server costs, internal security costs etc to all of the businesses and users that run nodes, mine BTC or use Bitcoin in their products/operations and say that they are contributing to the cost too. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:51:26
Ah, it was a fun discussion until you ruined it a bunch of false equivalences and logical fallacies that have no bearing to your argument that BTC is somehow energy efficient. I avoided the political discussion because it's not actually relevant to BTC's energy consumption really, I know the history of gold, and it still doesn't justify using enough energy to power entire countries for a few transactions a second.


The majority of fiat money in the Western world is digital, so a few databases get updated, that's it. No energy at all. Sometimes some paper is minted but it's a negligible cost. Arguing that point is frankly quite embarrassing, unless you're trolling at this point.
You don't get a mic drop, because you've been factually wrong and inconsistent with your arguments for this majority of this debate. You already tried a mic drop and figuratively had to pick it up when I walked you through your poor reasoning.
Two wrongs don't make a right, which is essentially your last ditch attempt to save your argument. Logical fallacies galore.
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:53:54


So you've just ignored the current economic model for how miners stay profitable with LN to say it "solved the energy problem"? 
Why would the hashrate go down if the total mining operation became more profitable, since the mining reward would become far more profitable if it actually triggered a much higher demand to transact (so far more fees on top?) I feel like you think that "millions of transactions a second" would become a reality which is orders of magnitude away from current global demand for pretty much any need to make payments in general. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:58:31
Yeah, I was waiting for the "lightning" argument.
It talks about reducing the confirmation times and increasing capacity. We don't know if this solves the **energy consumption** problem because opening and closing channels still requires miners, and it won't take all the transactions off of the main chain. 
If we assume increased demand -&gt; higher volume of txns -&gt; more fees in total and bigger btc rewards for miners -&gt; greater hash rate because profitability then -&gt; **more energy consumed to keep the main chain secure.** To match the efficiency of Visa for the same level of security (lightning is arguably less secure than the main chain in most cases) then you'd still need a demand for Bitcoin which is orders of magnitude higher than it is now, and what's to stop Ethereum or other cheaper/faster options from using it too? Or Stellar, for that matter? Then the competitive edge is gone. 
Edit: it's still creating a financial system at the cost if the Earth. 
Edit2: and that's assuming visa doesn't get competitive to keep its business, which of course it will. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 19:41:29
I didn't define what "secure enough" is in all fairness because it's a separate debate and distracts from the actual debate we are having which is the energy consumption of Bitcoin and whether it's justified for what the output it produces.


This was actually your example. And by definition, [it is an indirect cost.](




These are also not direct costs in the traditional sense.


That's exactly my point. Where do we stop with regards to the energy consumption by banks and Bitcoin?
The key fact is that the majority of what you are talking about has been factored into the 100 TWh figure anyway, under "branch costs." 
When you factor in the most significant costs for both sides, detailed [here]( (the things we can actually measure and cover most of the essential operations for both sides) and what the outputs are for each, then there is no reasonable way to justify having an energy requirement that is 3400x larger than the current industry standard.

I'll just use a credit card then, or pay in cash. You know, because it would be 5% cheaper to do so.
How does that fix the original problem of volatility, anyway? Since it could feasibly drop 10% in a day, or just 1%, or not at all.

This has been possible for decades before Bitcoin was invented \(using replication and partitioning.\) The fact that Bitcoin is append\-only isn't revolutionary.
IBM is focusing on a cross\-border payments solution that settles with Stellar underneath. I'm a huge fan of XLM but even I wonder sometimes if "blockchain" is necessary, simply because all the validators run Postgresql databases underneath. Transactions are all uniquely identified and "blocks" are simply 5 second logical groupings of transactions after some deterministic consensus has been reached.

1. Realistically pay 3.5-5&amp; to change back to your local currency and use it at 100&amp; of merchants. Or
2. Realistically pay 7-10&amp; to change back to BTC in the middle of a bear market and spend it at less than 1&amp; of merchants. 
Yeah, such possibilities.

Do you know that this BTC ATM takes coins? [It doesn't look like it.]( If not, then that's a completely moot point.
Also, who accumulates 50 euros in coins? Seriously?
And I've traveled to 25 countries in 4 continents in my 25 years of life, you condescending prick. If I don't know what the standard rates of exchange are at an airport, it's because I'm perfectly capable, as are people who haven't traveled before, of adequately working out a reasonable amount of foreign currency to buy beforehand. The amount left over is hardly ever over 50 euros worth, because people are sensible enough to spend their coins that they know they can't exchange. 
It's a non-problem. Even if some strange people do, you can't conclude that buying BTC from an ATM is a much more viable option for them.

5&amp; could mean an entire profit margin for a small/medium sized business.
What about the 12 minute average wait to confirm? You think merchants aren't at risk of volatility in that  period too?
Praying that the price doesn't change, the only way to properly avoid volatility is to convert to fiat after every transaction, and suddenly it's not so 'easy' to lose money by accepting BTC.
It begs the question too, if a merchant needs to spend time converting to fiat multiple times a day, pay a higher network fee to get their transactions into the next block to reduce risk from volatility, then pay fees to sell BTC that are equivalent to credit cards, why would they bother at all? The easiest way to not lose money would be to not accept BTC at all.
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:03:29
If I'm being downvoted because I didn't include "security against bail ins, inflation and forfeiture" in my definition of security then that's seriously harsh. That's hardly a typical definition of security and it's too broad. 
My understanding is that mining exists to secure the network by validating transactions and the decentralised approach is to spend (what ends up being) huge amounts of energy, which centralised fiat systems achieve the same result for a fraction of the resources. 
If I'm being downvoted because you all think it's easier to steal/lose fiat currency than it is to steal/lose Bitcoin then you're all delusional.

Your analogy about collecting foreign currencies is such a strawman anyway, since people bring back foreign currencies for sentimental value and nowhere near in the value of €50, but let's assume that they do.
For the sake of argument, let's assume that these forex exchanges are charging 10%, it's [€100 max per transaction at the BTC ATM]( and they charge €5 each time. So to get your money's worth, you would need to exchange at least €50 worth.
I don't pretend to know what the average amount of leftover currency is, but if you think anyone comes home with more than €50 because they can't spend it in the visiting country then "you are a fool." 
The average for any BTC ATM is 8.88% anyway. This machine is not worth celebrating.

So now to fix this already complicated set up, merchants need to write a script/hire a developer to code them something to automatically convert all of their payments into fiat as they come in?
And furthermore, to fix this already complicated set up, merchants are expected to hedge the BTC they receive?
All of this, to service a very small, niche group of bagholders who are all just as capable of paying in cash if you made them to?
Yeah, this is starting to sound like Charlie Day's solution to his living situation of sniffing glue and eating cat food.
@_date: 2018-06-18 14:28:02
I edited my comment, I meant risk of not getting paid, which is a risk for a merchant if they don't wait for confirmations on the **main chain**. Since you suggested yourself, there are no lightning-enabled exchanges to quickly avoid loss from volatility, before you try the "lightning" retort there.
How are you not getting how complicated this all is for a typical merchant?  Especially when credit cards and cash are massively more convenient to use and in most cases, cheaper to use?

Watching the BTC price with popcorn, I've been expecting to see the price go down for BCH as money gets taken out to be put in BTC, which seems to be happening for a lot of other coins right now. Yet it just hovers around the same $1600 price. It did this for a week or so before it's last spike.
Is this just a result of low trading volumes, or manipulation, or both? Or does BCH actually have some merit which is making it resilient to BTC rising?

The plain fact is that there is virtually no need to use Bitcoin in the UK. If I want to send money to someone, it's free and instant. If I want to pay for something, it's free and instant. I'm protected against loss and fraud, which I'm not with Bitcoin. 
Whether you agree or not, the masses don't value decentralisation as much as us, because decentralisation comes at the cost of being not being free, fast and being protected (for now.)
My point wasn't even about inflationary currency vs deflationary currency. It was about utility and ease of use.
I agree that it's an alternative to traditional banking and finance. But if it can't compete on fees, transaction times and being completely screwed in the event of your keys being lost, then don't expect it to be as common as cash or cards. Which is what the article is actually about.

UK banking services have improved massively and become competitive. You can "Monzo" money to someone else in the UK, instantly and for free, and regular bank transfers between other UK banks are free and pretty much instant as well. The fact that it isn't decentralised, trustless P2P is at the bottom of their list of priorities.
Others like Revolut offered fixed 1.5% exchange rates on foreign currency the last time I checked, not sure what it is now.
Bitcoin, right now, simply can't compete.
@_date: 2018-11-10 13:58:59

That entire rant was completely unnecessary. 
If you read what I said, I said that _right now_ the technology isn't ready, I never said it wouldn't be in the future. I never suggested that people weren't capable either. It was simply a comment that UK banking has advanced, and that Bitcoin needs to keep up with the pace and change the attitudes of those people who are already transacting cheaply and instantly. No-one knows exactly how/when the LN will mature.

How is that different from any stock option, or a business that needs new customers to survive? A pyramid needs it's operators to recruit others to survive. That's like saying a lemonade stand is a pyramid scheme because it needs new customers to come and buy lemonade for it to survive.


There are so many use cases for cryptocurrencies in general. Sticking with BTC, I would say anyone who wants to use a digital currency that isn't directly controlled by a central body, or people in countries with an unworkable or problematic currency (Zimbabwe, India, etc.)


[Not even sure if this is true anymore.]( They could be lower, but the situation has improved for now.
Edit: I think you are under the impression that the end game for everyone is to make a quick buck and cash out back to fiat, which is probably true for a lot of the newcomers. There are still a lot of hardcore Bitcoin users who use it for its intended purpose.
Edit2: changed first retort
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:16:34
 &gt; Most people around the world have few problems with money controlled by a central body; that's what they get paid in, what they use to pay for goods and services for daily life, etc.
What about those who want to send money abroad? Currently, changing your fiat for the relevant foreign currency and sending it, takes considerable time and expense to do so. That's why I hold XRP and Stellar, and Bitcoin solves that problem at a P2P level. 
There are people who don't trust central bodies at all and don't want to be reliant on currencies that can be printed from nothing and distributed, and some who want to be less reliant on them, and in those cases Bitcoin and other cryptos serve a use due to the fact that it is scarce and a trustless system (probably open to debate.) 


You don't need a mining rig or to run a full node to use Bitcoin. And contrary to your claim, [there is already a want for, and means of getting Bitcoin in Zimbabwe.]( 
It's palliative - I never suggested it would solve the problem of corrupt governments, but it provides a workaround to their [hyperinflation issues]( 
Edit: there are issues with fiat

Don't pay attention to market cap for cryptocurrencies, it's not a good indicator of the actual amount of USD invested.
