can you let me know any good decentralized exchange that does not suck and has any volume. I heard horror stories about etherdelta and there is little volume there.

This is awesome and a game changes. All crypto exchanges that operate now have zero customer service. if we get system like how it is for securities, I think this space will explode. I hope they start early as I hope to do all my future purchases at robinhood and store offline in ledger. 
Only advantage gdax has is zero transfer fees even for bitcoin. Here it will cost money to move offline.

Great job deannolan. I would also give a shout out for wikipedia. I did donate some as well. Their service are essential to modern world. 
Beyond that there are so many great causes. Couple I want to mention are
1. The Water Project	thewaterproject.com	The Water Project is unlocking human potential by providing sustainable water projects to communities in sub-Saharan Africa who suffer needlessly from a lack of access to clean water and proper sanitation. Access to water unlocks potential. It removes obstacles that hinder a community from growing itself out of poverty.	1HesYJSP1QqcyPEjnQ9vzBL1wujruNGe7R	Yes!
2	Save The Children		Save the Children invests in childhood – every day – in times of crisis and for our future. In the United States and around the world – we give children a healthy start – the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	bitcoin:	Yes!

Cuba is sanctioned entity. So will be picked up by transaction monitoring software at any regulated company.

why is that. They are one of the biggest and with USD pairing their volume will increase BIG TIME. 
Also Robinhood and even COSS will add USD pairing for coins in the exchange. Bitcoin will ultimately lose hegemony on that end for sure.

That is not right. Almost all off the big exchanges support ETH pairings. That is how I have been buying alts as well. That is not the reason for this cryptocalypse. I think Tether/bitfinex issues, Chinese New Year and all FUDs around Korea/India. It will settle down after CNY and then let us see.

Never catch a falling knife. I think it will go below 5K for sure. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:41:55
if bitcoin hits 50K market cap would be closer to 2 Trillion than 1 Trillion.

if its similar to square cash then price of bitcoin will be at a premium compared to gdax. Ultimately we will buy at a site that has the lowest price. Also gdax transfers are free while robinhood will charge the xfer fee of the exchange at minimum.

I agree. We are better off waiting for it to confirm recovery before buying.

I dont deny that today. Bitcoin crash crashed Alts. But its impact will be less if more mainstream exchanges are available and they support multiple coins against Fiat. That is inevitable. Already Bitcoin is just 1/3 of overall crypt market cap and I feel it will go down to 1/4 by year end.
