Unfortunately, my original account got hacked a few years ago and now is used for advertising. Is there any way to check a balance without having access?

180% return on amount of bitcoin, not normal world currency like USD. Still a ponzi scheme.

Good to know.

Colonial? Who proofread this shit?

Same, I remember when people tipped comments with bitcoin. I think I was tipped once but I've no clue how to access it, oh well.

I'm betting it's more like MC Hammer.

Can you explain why your company's ID verification system is still not working? Are they developing a fix action, or not?
I made the mistake of trying to get an account while living in Japan and not having a non-federal ID. Now my account is locked as Japanese and not allowing me to trade at all. Your support page hasn't been updated on that issue since Dec 9th, as far as I can tell. I've tried multiple times this week with no success.

Looked legit enough to take a 1.5 Bitcoin gamble with no risks attached, no more.

Not interested in maintaining this account anyway. Coinbase is a trash company who can't even authenticate prospective clients.

How often do you have fans that fail, though? And even if it did fail, how would that be significantly different than not having it to begin?

Coinbase does not authorize international accounts to add bank accounts.

The US government hasn't acknowledged Bitcoin as a currency.
