Very very good explanation.  Im so surprised how many people dont see the benefit of inflation.  People also think inflation makes them lose money, when in fact, it affects everyboddy which in turn everyboddy will have the same buying power.

Reproduction at a growing rate is bad for environment since we comsume alot. Deflation for a currency is also bad if everyboddy is aware that the value will increase.

I can say one thing for sure. Its way more important for a currency to have stable inflation than a stable deflation.  People spending money is very important for a secure sustainable currency. A deflation is a beg for not spending a dime. In the end everyboddy lose.

Ofc, sound money is preferable. But having a slight inflation does alot less harm than slight deflation. Thats what this is all about.

This is the perfect example of «share half of the truth to make people believe the opposite».  I guess you left out our wage increase and our controlled inflation to encurage investment and to keep the economy balanced and healthy. I`ll excuse you this time, OP.  What really matters is what will one hour of work pay for in 2018 vs 1918.

If there was high deflation, the rich would sell theyre assets, hold money and I dont know what would happen to the economy or the society. You cant say inflation or deflation will affect only one group. People with wealth will take action doing what will serve them the most. And no, I dont like that, but other steps need to be taken to help the poor; not adjust value of money.

I believe those most interested running a full node, are those with the most fund. They are in fact the people affected the most if security is compromised. 
Shoot me if im ln a total different planet here. Im no pro and this is what I just figured. :)

I have yet to meet that person who's done his research and then come up with actual reasons for why bitcoin is bad. I think bitcoin will remain, even though it has disadvantages compared to new currencies. Bitcoin was first, nothing will ever change that. And that is something people will know and remember sa long as crypto is around.
