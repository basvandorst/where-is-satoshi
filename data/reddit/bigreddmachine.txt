Hi everyone,
I host a podcast that focuses on privacy-related projects in the space. Last week I had the opportunity to talk with Andrew Poelstra (for about an hour about Mimblewimble, going into a lot of the deep technicals of how the protocol works and implications of its use.
I figured this subreddit would be interested in the content. I had a blast doing this interview, and I hope you enjoy it too!
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:57:35
Thanks, I will look into these more tonight when I get home.
RemindMe! 6 hours
@_date: 2014-07-14 22:34:29
That's a good idea. I am going to look into doing that.
@_date: 2014-09-25 05:01:49


I'm not sure I know what you mean... Are you proposing getting bitcoin back instead of change when paying cash?  Otherwise, aren't you just talking about change addresses?  Cash back at a register works because you have a bank account with cash in it.  You don't have that with Bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-12-08 06:23:44
Hahaha! Skye, nontechnical, rofl. She's the best btw.
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:58:06
Is this part of the counterparty project?
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:59:19
What I was envisioning was setting up something like a march madness bracket pool, and then in some decentralized way awarding the winning with a payout that was set up at the beginning of the toournament.  Thanks for the response.
@_date: 2014-07-14 19:38:45
That's not how journals work...
@_date: 2014-10-07 21:23:06
I will have to read more about p2sh addresses.
I was hoping that something might be able to be built that could enable what I described.  I suppose something that was centralized could be created easily enough.  Decentralizing it would be the hard part, since, as you state, you don't know the winner at the start.
@_date: 2014-07-14 18:59:31
Thank you for the advice!
@_date: 2014-10-25 16:54:02
How can we get involved with the project, and how do we see what stage it is actually at?  The google groups page did not have a lot of information and had many broken links.
@_date: 2014-07-14 17:35:15
Sure, going to edit the OP too.
@_date: 2014-07-14 17:36:17
Oops, meant to direct link you as well...
@_date: 2014-10-24 17:05:30
Yes.  That's the same thing.  That's all I meant.
"two-decimal notation" referred to the fact that 100 satoshi can be called 1.00 bits.  so Satoshi become like cents and Bits become like dollars/euros/etc.  Instead of having 8-decimal-notation with Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-07-14 19:39:01
@_date: 2014-07-14 19:00:40
Maybe. There could be a fund set up much like foundation funds. Certainly something to consider.
*edit because of my phone...
@_date: 2017-02-19 06:17:02
Thanks for the advise. I previously saw The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin and found it to actually tell a compelling story relative to this new one. It's been a couple years though, so I might be remembering it as better than it was. I'll check this one out.
@_date: 2017-02-25 18:02:12
Any plans to support audio content?
@_date: 2014-10-29 03:05:07
Interesting.  Nice find.  Seems he went 1.5 years without posting, and then a year without posting.  I guess that is his right!
@_date: 2017-02-19 05:06:02
Right, I don't want my time back or anything. I just felt like it was pretty lackluster from a evangelization / education standpoint.
@_date: 2014-10-28 21:38:22
It means his account has posted between 30 and 59 times and is at least 15 days old.
So essentially, what it means is that if BitBoy is still on the forums, it is under another name.
@_date: 2017-02-19 03:32:55
If you have an air gapped computer that never sees an internet connection, bluetooth, etc, then that is effectively a hardware wallet. I suppose the "20th person is careless" comment is a bit of a hyperbole, but my point still stands, "if you're unwilling to buy *even* a $100 hardware wallet..." There are alternatives, possibly the cheapest being an airgapped raspberry pi zero connected to an old monitor but a more realistic one being an old or cheap laptop with the wireless card removed. My point was, you have to spend money to secure that kind of store.
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:08:47
yes, that's about right.  Same neighborhood, but a hell of a lot easier to remember.
@_date: 2017-02-22 05:49:00
interesting. glad to hear a newcomer found it helpful!
@_date: 2017-02-18 18:55:25
If you hold 100 BTC, aka $100,000, and you're unwilling to buy even a $100 hardware wallet, then yes, you're careless. Full stop.
@_date: 2014-10-22 02:58:27
100 sats is 1 millionth of a bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2017-02-19 05:05:20
Yep. To anyone without Prime, you can rent it there for $4-5 bucks, but I think you can find it somewhere else cheaper if you want to watch it.
@_date: 2017-08-29 01:11:30
Did the CU Bitcoin club ever get revitalized? I've been looking for a group at CU for years to talk BTC with.
@_date: 2017-01-13 05:23:19
it's working.
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:00:22
Talk about a zero knowledge proof...
@_date: 2015-08-11 12:01:37
If only... It would need some feature though where a central authority couldn't just change the money supply without the majority agreeing...
@_date: 2015-08-05 14:53:48
that's a cool extension. would you be interested if I make a similar, open source one that uses bitpay's insight explorer?
edit: i guess that one is open source, actually.
@_date: 2015-08-08 02:55:01

Oh hey! That's mine! Thanks for sharing it here :)
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:19:57
If you don't mind me asking, what service do you use to get a temporary # like that?
@_date: 2015-08-27 14:12:49
Happy Cake Day @_date: 2015-08-24 22:56:45
Thanks Not-Jeff / Quasi-Steve!
Looks like you're right. I wonder if they even realize the discrepancy.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:42:40
Cartoon creator here... perhaps that might have been the point? Glad someone didn't immediately assume anything about the message :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:51:13
Woah, thanks for weighing in Greg!
Cartoon creator here, but not OP. I was surprised this morning to see that my cartoon (that I'd tweeted out yesterday) had been shared here and also been a top post for a while. Having you chime in and not totally crap on the cartoon is a nice bonus!
Thanks for your work you do! I'd love to have you on my podcast to chat about enhancing Bitcoin privacy with Bulletproofs, CT, etc. if you'd ever be interested! (

To get around the WSJ pay wall, go to Google and search "Chine Moves to Devalue Yuan", and click the first link.

Hi Jeff,
What does it mean that AntPool (for ex.) is only voting 8MB blocks in roughly half of their blocks?
Is AntPool somehow letting their users decide per-block?
@_date: 2015-08-08 02:55:26
(this is by Bitpay, btw. an open source js library)
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:14:00
Nah, just generic business man type. Or perhaps Craig Wright, Gavin Andresen, etc.
@_date: 2015-08-24 04:15:22
I thought Coinbase as a payment processor had really lagged behind the exchange and wallets part of the business?
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:08:55
The cartoon depicts the reality of how the two sides are perceived. I have no problem with "doing both" - but that's not what is usually seen advocated by either of the depicted sides.
Someone else in this thread said something like "I can't tell which is better" to which I said something like "maybe that's the point". 
Does that make any sense?
@_date: 2015-07-13 17:46:25
Pro Tip: Just do a google search of the headline, and click the first link.  Gets past the WSJ pay wall 100% of the time, every time.  At least until it doesn't.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:37:46
... *My cartoon has gone meta* ... *My life is complete* ...
@_date: 2017-04-02 17:33:10


FTFY ;)
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:39:14
The guy who posted this (was not the creator of the cartoon (me), fyi. I tweeted this yesterday, and I guess the OP (who I don't think I know) thought it worth sharing. So make fun of him if you want, but if you don't like the cartoon then blame me.

Banking on Bitcoin was recommended by somehow in this thread from a couple months ago: 
@_date: 2017-04-23 14:32:14
Sounds like OpenAlias.
Invented by the Monero team but implemented in a couple Bitcoin wallets, including Electrum.
@_date: 2015-04-15 04:40:31
3 more and it'll be virtually set in stone.
@_date: 2015-04-15 04:38:39
I don't understand why no one seem's to have mentioned a bitcoin ATM... couldn't you withdraw to fiat, then deposit to btc?
@_date: 2015-09-11 15:39:17
Thanks for the tip!
And you're welcome. I got a message on my browser that said it had been removed, but didn't say anything more.
@_date: 2015-09-03 16:03:00
Ahh, I was misreading what that bit of the spec was for based on a misconception elsewhere that I had. Thank you.
@_date: 2015-09-03 15:30:50
That's great, thanks.
As a follow up, since I now realize he was referring to versionBits already in the code, how does the version get changed as part of the voting? When a miner signals that they want to increase the limit, do they also start using a higher versionBits value?
@_date: 2015-09-03 15:15:32
Hi Jeff, Could you explain what you mean by your last point, maybe in pseudocode?
"Block version number is calculated after masking out high 16 bits (final bit count TBD by versionBits outcome)."
@_date: 2015-09-02 05:27:43
It's a bit buried, but Jeff replied below:
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:48:27
I also read it.  Just finished it on Saturday actually.  I felt like it captures why so many people are so excited about bitcoin.  It's a good book to recommend to people who (a) are interested in money, (b) are skeptical of bitcoin but interested enough to discuss it, and/or (c) value the WSJ.  My dad, for instance.
@_date: 2015-03-06 05:03:30
Happy cake day!  Mine too.  Today you are exactly twice as old as me in reddit years!

I talk with Erik Voorhees about his journey to Bitcoin, eventually leading to the creation of ShapeShift, and his vision for the platform. Among many things, we discuss ShapeShift's recent $10+ million VC round and ShapeShift's responsibility to the community to verify coins that are added to the platform.
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:38:28
I've started a new one that's probably 50/50 split between Monero and Bitcoin. The show mostly covers people and companies in the space but sometimes will venture more into the tech itself or various related topics of interest.
Most notable guests so far with regards to more than just Monero are Riccardo Spagni, Erik Voorhees, and the SALT Lending guys.
 if you're interested.

Xekyo - 
I'm pretty sure it originated with Dogecoin, or at least that's when it really took off.
Google trends shows it peaking in February 2014 right when Doge was going bonkers.

I talked with Shawn Owen (CEO) and Caleb Slade (Creative &amp; Community Director) about their new blockchain-backed loans platform, SALT Lending, launching soon. SALT stands for Secured Automated Lending Technology. Find out why they say SALT will provide a secure, private way to borrow against your cryptocurrency holdings, and how you might become either a borrower or lender with their service.
Episodes are also available in transcript form on our website, or on most major podcast apps including iTunes, Google Play, Pocket Casts, and Stitcher.

In that case, use Copay: 
They have wallets for the browser and wallet apps for iOS and Android, not to mention OS X, Windows, and Linux.
Optional multisignature, and if i recall correctly their wallets use mnemonic seeds for easy backups.
@_date: 2015-03-26 00:47:23
Maybe you mentioned this elsewhere, but how about just a notifications area on the main page that says something whenever you've done this to an account?

Yeah, I think I might start buying coffee there regularly.  It's a couple minutes out of my way (I walk past another coffee shop that I usually frequent near my office on my way to this one) but it's actually cheaper to get coffee there anyway!  So I get cheaper coffee + can use bitcoin, they don't have to pay fees, and I get a bonus 2 minutes of excercise haha :)

How did someone buy bitcoin in 2009? Was that even possible? I guess he might have bought some from a friend, but it'd seem like that friend would have just given them to him since they were worthless.
That price is also markedly higher than the 10,000 BTC for 2 pizzas deal the next year.
This doesn't sound right...
