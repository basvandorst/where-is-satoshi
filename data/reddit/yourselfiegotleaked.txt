True, however I'm sure as popularity increases so too will the infrastructure surrounding it. The exchanges will improve and I hope wallets and whatnot will get simpler.

Gold and Bitcoin could both be currencies. They both are already stores of value, they would just need to become units of account, accepted means of exchange (which might be happening with Bitcoin, seeing as how the top player on the team will be payed in it!), and it would need to be the standard of deferred payment. Bitcoin acts as a store of value as you and I said, and if it starts getting used more as a means of exchange, it would be a slow process, but it could eventually start getting used as a unit of account, and from there become a standard of deferred payment. All I'm saying is that if it already acts as one, that could lead to the others.
