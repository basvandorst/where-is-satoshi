Thanks, I did stumble on that too. I ran the -zap option, rescanning now, about 50% there...hoping that works.

I'm on a spinning HDD (old school, I know). Plenty of space (300Gigs or so), but the disk could be work-hardened/frag'd all to hell. Good suggestion, I'll try that. I _do_ hear my HDD taking a beating on this - it's constantly seeking.
Edit: and thanks for the -dbcache tip. I'll try that too.

Whoa! Huge thanks jwinterm, you just helped me with the missing piece - I was unclear about which keys to use - I thought I only needed one address; not the 4 (for me) that contain coins. Makes sense now.
However, one final piece: what address do I enter in the Electrum _Sweep Private Keys_ "Address" dialog box (down at the bottom)?
EDIT: dipshit checking in for duty. I see that the address is auto generated (in red, I deleted it the first time by mistake) when I open the Sweep dialog. Doh. Got that figured out. 
EDIT2: ok, 3 of 4 keys worked like a charm (after I hit Broadcast). However, my 4th key gave me a "No inputs found" error. Here's my guess: while waiting for the BlockChain to sync in Bitcoin Core Wallet, I tried to transfer out a few mBTC to my Electrum wallet as a test. However, because the BC hasn't confirmed that transaction, I'm guessing that key is now "locked" until the transaction is confirmed. So, I think I successfully shot myself in the foot and have now committed to having re-sync the entire BC in order to get the rest of my coins. I tried doing an "abandontransaction" from the BCCWallet console, but got the "Transaction not eligible for abandonment (code -5)". 
Does that explanation sound plausible, or have I missed something? Any workaround?
Thanks again for the help!

Thanks nullc...I added a bunch of nodes via the "-addnode=" command line, things seem to be "cruising" now - managed to sync two whole weeks worth in half a day or so - still pathetic, but seems maybe a bit better.
Regarding bootstrapping, I read it in at least 5 different places as I've been researching this. Here's an example:  
About the outdated Core (i'm at v0.13.0) - fair point, you are right. I thought I had the latest, but apparently I'm off by a minor release - looks like v0.13.1 is the newest. Thanks for pointing that out.

holy crap. that's not encouraging...but glad to know that I'm not the only victim of the stupid-big blockchain

Worked! Thanks again for the suggestions. Somehow I came up 33-cents short (USD), but I'll still call that a complete win. All coins in Electrum now and avoided the month-long resync. Goodbye BCwallet!

100% agree. that's my goal. I've been running qt/wallet for something like 3-4 years, but I'm 200% done with it now - moving to a thin client (Electrum) as soon as I can get my coins out of BTwallet and then grenade it.

OHHH, I read a bit about doing that, but (a) I didn't think it applied to me and, (b) I have no idea how to do it...
time for some more Gargling...
EDIT: I didn't think it applied to me as I thought I still needed to sync the whole BC first before exporting the private keys.
