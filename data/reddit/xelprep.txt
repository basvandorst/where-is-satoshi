If the transaction is visible in the blockchain and the address is verified correct you just need to resync your multibit client.

What about their cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2014-07-09 10:57:19
Done. Now what?
@_date: 2014-07-05 10:49:46
My first tip. Thanks, man!
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:28:17
Can you create a new cryptsy account and transfer any coins there?  Abandon the account with the negative BTC.

"correct horse battery staple" is an example brain wallet seed that gets swept any time somebody foolishly send bits to it. Rot13 is a basic method of obfuscating text. Imagine the alphabet displayed in a circle. Rot13 is spinning that circle halfway (26 letters in the alphabet) and applying it twice would leave you with your input text unchanged. 
Check out rot13.com to try it out.

Isn't it a fetish to want to "authenticate" your wife with two "factors"?

The world would be a better place if there were more people that thought this way. I love your comment.

True, but I've never known middlecoin to send without fees.

I'm using luke-jr's Mac OS build of the latest Bitcoin Core.  Syncing didn't go as fast as I had hoped with the new "headers first" method.  Using the latest bootstrap.dat still took many hours.
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:41:57
Got through 2009-2012 pretty quick, then it got jammed up.  The computer has about 50 mbps available but it was looking like it was going to take several more hours to finish syncing 2012 through today.  I gave up, trashed the synced data (not sure if I needed to do this) and then restarted the client with the latest bootstrap.dat.  All in all took maybe 6 to 8 hours to fully sync.  Not exactly sure because I went to bed at some point before it finished.  This doesn't seem as fast as one would expect since the devs stated the headers are about 27 MB.  
EDIT:  Maybe I needed to be connected to 0.10 clients for this to work right.  Does the headers-first work while connected to 0.8 and 0.9 peers?
EDIT 2:  Going through the debug log it appears I may have been mistaken.  It looks like it took about 5.5 hours just to sync from block 316075 to now.

I must have been connected to some slow peers, then. The bootstrap only took 2-3 hours to download via BitTorrent and my cpu is a recent i5 clocked at 3.8 ghz. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 10:45:29
Why 0.9 and not 0.10?  I'm only asking out of curiosity and because you verified you are running a node. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:40:48
I'll just go ahead and leave it running.  Whichever direction bitcoin is headed, I just want to help it get there quickly and reliably.

It saw you had typed $0.50 earlier in your post and went with the lower amount

Successfully performed a &lt;1 BTC instant buy.  Literally seconds before the price dropped $20 on btc-e. I ain't even mad.

The increase in hash rate would lead to an equal increase in difficulty so that confirmations would still take approximately 10 minutes.

Running 10.9 for a while here. Latest client works fine, except it seems to "app nap" when not focused. All this seems to do is throttle the CPU cycles consumed by the client and slow down blockchain sync.

Seriously. Is this shirt being made?  I need it.

I did get a bit of a chuckle from his comment history, though.
