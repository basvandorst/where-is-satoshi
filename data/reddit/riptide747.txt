I expect backlash from this, but Bitcoin definitely can be abused. Just look at all the major backs pumping and dumping. If billionaire banks can directly manipulate the price to make quick gains, the currency isn't stable. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:15:08
Same. Sent a support ticket in and haven't heard anything. Fuck Bitstamp.

Bitstamp is so fucking bad. I've been waiting for almost 2 months for verification and see dozens of other people with the same problem.

Because fees make it unusable for buying things so it's only value is the value itself. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:01:44
I think I might sell. Bought .92 at $4,500 and never thought it would get this high. It will most likely fall very soon with this massive spike and even though I will probably look back and hate myself for selling at $17k when it hits 100k, it's just hard to pass up. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:01:46
Never selling is a stupid way to use it

I've been waiting to get approved for Bitstamp for over a month

Slow being an understatement. Been waiting over a month for them to approve my account.

That defeats the purpose of a Trezor doesn't it? It's for long term cold storage not day use. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:02:08
Applied for a bitstamp account to buy ripple a week ago. Still haven't gotten authenticated.

Long term gains are taxed much less. Just hold for a year and you're good 
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:58:44

Bought in at $4500 what's a correction? 
@_date: 2015-06-30 06:55:28
I can't help but feel Bitcoin could potentially be the next Apple and in 5-10 years be worth billions, but I don't have enough money to feel safe investing in it. What is the general consensus for how the future of Bitcoin will turn out to be? I don't want to be that guy that buys $1 worth of Bitcoin only to have it explode and not have bought more, but I'm not financially stable enough to put a lot in without solid evidence supporting the rise of the market. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 06:29:57
Do people play the BitCoin market like the stock market buying low and selling/cashing out high?
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:13:17
Not sure why anyone would buy this for something they'll use once every few months/years. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 15:44:59
Thanks for explaining everything! Is there a way to get Bitcoin quicker in Coinbase? I bought $20 worth and it'll be "delivered" July 6th. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:52:42
Sounds like a crypto t_d
@_date: 2019-11-04 21:29:09
@_date: 2019-11-04 20:34:02
Do I have to pay taxes if I held for over a year before cashing out? According to a few guides it says anything under $38,000 over a year is 0% and I held much less than that. Do I need to file at all since it's 0%?
@_date: 2019-11-04 21:31:42
Nope so I guess I was mistaken
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:43:58
Also, how much do people generally think is high enough to warrant getting a hardware wallet like Trezor? If you're only buying $100 there's not much point in buying a wallet that costs more than that, but what about $500? $1,000?
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:09:46
Apologies if this has been asked,
What do people think about all of these tech sites saying Bitcoin's massive growth is unsustainable and will crash soon?

So I have BC I want to sell but don't want to go anywhere near Coinbase because of their time delays and nonexistent customer service. Is there any other company that makes it easy to sell BC immediately?

Are there any other cryptos that people are investing in now like Bitcoin from 2010? I'm looking to buy into a crypto that's at the $5 or less range but not sure which ones are generally seen as being another success like Bitcoin.

Takes an entire week to transfer money from my bank to Gdax. Wish there was a faster way. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 01:56:42
I went in at $4,500
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:21:18
Is there any way to buy Bitcoins immediately? I've tried Coinbase but it makes me wait an entire WEEK before I can even transfer funds into Gdax and I'm fully verified. A week is an eternity with rising and lowering prices.
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:10:34
I didn't know a dip was possible, I just saw it happen and wanted to buy during it. I bought $30 of Bitcoin a year or so ago and haven't been involved since, but once I saw all the fuss about the dip when researching bitcoin I wanted to get back into it. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 06:04:07
How was I supposed to know it would take a week to transfer from my bank?

The only feature I want in an app that I haven't seen is the ability to manually put in bitcoin values to track. So if you have .5 bitcoins in a wallet somewhere, you should be able to manually put however much you have into the tracker so you always know how much it's worth. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:42:09
Then sign me up!

Wasn't an auto mod. It was an actual mod. I commented on a post titled "upvote this piece of shit to the front page" or something with Ajit Pai in the picture. I said something like, "people must be stupid if they think upvoting his picture will change anything" and I got an auto mod warning about the word, "stupid". So I messaged the mods and asked why someone could call someone a piece of shit and get on the front page of the sub but if I say someone is stupid I get a warning and they banned me.

Well I went all in at $4500 because everyone seemed to think it would keep rising and it was never a bad time to get in.
