Why should i chose bcoin over bitcore, already in node.js?
@_date: 2016-08-26 14:38:21
When you have a debit card, this is what happends:
* Card issuer opens a proxy bank account in your name, for exmaple at a bank like Wavecrest. H 
* You sell bitcoin to the card issuer
* The card issuer probably goes to sell it himself on an exchange, or to a broker.
*  He settles in fiat to you by moving fiat from his master account at the bank to your  sub proxy account
In your case, you might as well just go directly to the broker and/or exchange and settle to your bank account. If you can settle to your bank account, get multiple individual debit cards for your management team and use it all yourself.

localbitcoins is soon becoming obsolete as a platform. It's primarily used as a search engine for pro-traders that accept high-risk payment methods.
Also, when you sell tens of thousands of dollars of bitcoins and up, you generally both agree not to pay lbc's 1% fee.

I disagree about phone wallets. It's much easier to be the victim of malware via computer and much harder to download malicious apps. The iphone is a much safer environment than a laptop IMO.
Also, app wallets are much safer then webwallets. Most people lost their BTC from a blockchain.info phishing link, login info lost/stolen.

Yes, cash and "bank account dollars" are not fungible. That is why criminals will pay an average of 10-20% to move between cash and bank accounts.
@_date: 2016-04-16 05:23:15
that's almost worse, because:
1. if it's a paper wallet, they will literally need to get in touch with you so you manually sign the transaction (assuming its 2-of-2)
2. if its 1-of-2 you can still take the funds at any time
3. if it's 2-of-2 and you lose access to funds they lose the bitcoins forever
I you really want to instruct people how Bitcoin works, make a tutorial on how to generate private keys and paper wallets.
Sorry but nothing about this makes any sense.
I appreciate the effort (if, in fact, this is not an attempt to defraud newbies) but this is not something that any Bitcoiner should ever recommend to anyone.

It is a fact that bitcoins are not fungible, since "clean coins" are sold at a premium on certain markets. 
@_date: 2016-04-01 16:33:24
many wallets do, but it's sometimes hard for us (Bitcoin Embassy) to get people to install wallets. E.g. they want bitcoin for ransomware / as a gift but don't come in person with a mobile device or laptop. It's easier form such "noobs" (I'm assuming a large part of the target market) to just input the "recipient's account" and "their private key" in a browser. If the tool is easy to use (didn't see that, but that's cool) that fixes the issue.

Essentially the signed invoice is timestamped using opentimestamps on the Bitcoin blockchain (and also the chainpoint protocol on the Ethereum Classic Blockchain which we use for testing)

What's going on here:
Saint-Laurent boulevard (called "the Main" by locals) is closed during the Grand Prix for pedestrians. The Bitcoin Embassy is located right in front of Buena Notte, the Grand Prix's most notorious fancy restaurant and club. There is a huge line-up in front and every year there is a massive "bottleneck" between our booth and their party.
This creates a massive crowd around the Bitcoin Embassy, and we love to stay there until very late in the night as people who are stuck (or waiting in line - or smoking a cigarette outside the club) pick-up our educational booklets, flyers, check out our miners and ask us some questions.
The police came by three nights in a row to protect our glass windows from a rowdy crowd and make sure that the party doesn't degenarate.
Edit: Satoshi Counter is the physical Bitcoin exchange located on the 1st floor of the Bitcoin Embassy

Mycelium is the  (Android) wallet we recomment to all visitors at the Bitcoin Embassy and clients of Satoshi Counter. We use it internally as well. I've probably helped install over 500 mycelium wallets.

That's what I do for a living. I run  it's a physical Bitcoin exchange based out of Montreal. We have a bunch of people running doing over-the-phone + SMS + email sales. We also have a few localbitcoins + paxful accounts.
So technically, we also bought 1M$ worth of coins in the last 4 months from other people too :P
At lest 90% of our liquity for purchases and sales comes from off-exchange, and I know for a fact that most brokers like us are in the same situation. In canada, at least, I suspect barely 10% of the volume is actually on exchanges (if that)

Hello Patrick, Francis here from the Bitcoin Foundation Canada.
First of all, congratulations on the nomination. You've already contributed enormously to our community and I know that you will do an amazing job as the Foundation's new leader.
In my opinion, the most important and easy thing the Foundation could do right away to improve community relations is to produce a general breakdown of the Foundation's expenses and a detailed corporate structure. 
A comment: the Foundation seems very bureaucratic in its structure. It's very difficult to understand who does what exactly, what the exact priorities are and how these are being implemented. A detailed, honest annual report (with hard data) would be most welcomed. 
My questions are:
- You mentioned in your last blog post that "my first priority is to cut out distractions and focus the Bitcoin Foundation on the areas where we can add the most value for the bitcoin community". Regarding this statement: According to you, what should be the Foundation's primary and essential mission? (please name only the most important one)
- What past activities of the Foundation do you consider to be distractions?
- Regarding standardization and development, what additional steps will the Foundation take to support core development? If you have some concrete proposals I think we would all love to hear them.
- Membership has been slow to rise and as far as I can tell there is a revenue problem. What additional revenue streams will you seek?
- Do you think the affiliate program has so far been a success? 
- In the long-term, do you think Bitcoin's main function will be as a store of value, a means of payment or both?
- Do you consider the rise of cryptocurrency 2.0 platforms as positive, neutral or negative for Bitcoin?
- Have you given any thought about the sidechains project?
Feel free to only answer some of these questions.
I think the community has been very unfair towards the Foundation, which is composed of humans just like us. I wish you the best of luck on your mandate! You can count on my continued support.

This is why I think our publications is most important. The target audience is mainly journalists, as they are the ones that usually relay information from "academic" sources to the public (the general public does not usually read reports such as this one in their entirety).
What I see in the newspapers is a cycle of journalists re-using the same material/content from other newspapers. Hopefully this publication will give them some content to relay to the public

Rather than using Gyft, have you considered just selling BTC on local bitcoins? getting regular buyers? It's the same concept as Gyst - you're still selling coins to buy stuff.

Coinkite offers many features that enhance security (notably 2FA and multisignature adresses). Considering the large amount of features that Coinkite offers + ease-of-use, I would consider it the best option for you.
GreenAddress, when used properly (little learning curve to using it*), also provides a high degree of security. 
Obviously the safest would be using the Trezor, which has a corresponding web wallet at mytrezor.com. Although not really a "web wallet" per say, you can consider mytrezor.com as a web-wallet with its own specific 2FA system which is the Trezor device (it is not exactly 2FA because the private keys are held on the Trezor but serves the same purpose: you need the actual device +  Trezor pin to be able to use the web wallet). You can use it on any computer - all you need to do is download a small driver on the computer which you are using it.

Unrevised transcript:
By far my favorite part:
**Senator Black**: I would like to join with my colleagues in thanking and congratulating each of you for 
these outstanding presentations. I have only been at the Senate a year and a half, but this is clearly one of 
the best panels I have had the privilege of working with.
Speaking for myself, I view my role on this file as to assist, in a meaningful way, innovation, as you have 
discussed today. That's how I'm trying to look at this. How do we assist this innovative technology, this 
disruptive technology, as you referred to? You have to help me. We had a lot of conversation today started 
by our chairman around regulation or not. 
I would need specifics. What would you like this committee to do to assist the development of this, right 
to the point? What would you like us to do? Maybe the answer is nothing, and if that's the answer, tell us. 
But if there is something that you need to do to enhance Canada's position as a destination for innovation, 
I want to know that. *Let's cut right to the chase: Tell us what you need from us*.
**Mr. Perklin**: I'll start. I'm sure each one of my colleagues will have comments.
One of the things that would be beneficial to the innovation that my company is trying to provide to 
Canadians is the ability to open a bank account. When I am accepting funds from my customers in exchange for my services, I want to accept a cheque, but I cannot accept a cheque because my company has no bank account. I'm unable to do that. At the end of my tax year, when it comes time to remit payment to the government, I have no ability to write a cheque to give the Canadian government the money they deserve for the business I've conducted here in Canada. Instead, I have to have one of my employees write a cheque to the government on behalf of my company, and then I can reimburse them with bitcoin, because we cannot accept funds in any other way than cash.
To answer your question specifically, Senator Black, one I thing I would love to see is the ability for 
bitcoin businesses in Canada to open bank accounts at our major banks.
**Mr. Hoegner**: I think we would very much appreciate the focus and ability of the crypto-currency 
ecosystem to focus on arriving at its own solutions and to see how this plays out in at least the short to 
medium term. Bearing in mind the changes that have been made in Bill C-31 and in the regulations that are 
forthcoming, I would love to see this committee understand what crypto-currency is, really get its arms 
around what crypto-currency is, and not necessarily make any policy changes at this point.
**Mr. Babin-Tremblay**: One outstanding issue is the taxation classification of bitcoin. The CRA classified it, I think, as a non-appreciating capital asset. Obviously, with Bill C-31, it's being included in the proceeds of money laundering and whatever the name of that thing is. You guys know.
One of the key dangers here that we have to avoid is to come up with some sort of double taxation 
scheme for bitcoin. If you treat it as a commodity, as for capital gains purposes, you cannot also charge sales tax and treat it also like a currency. That is one of the main outstanding issues that needs to be resolved: In which category does it fall for taxation purposes? I am sure Jillian has suggestions here, but from an entrepreneur, that's one of the important outstanding issues that needs to be cleared.
**Ms. Friedman**: I think Mr. Hoegner spelled out very well what I would have said as an answer. I would 
add approach this questioning in the spirit of competition between different technologies and institutions 
that provide financial services and in a way that is as technologically neutral as possible. 
If you look at different services being provided, it wouldn't be fair to say that an exchange that has the 
same risk of money laundering, for example, changing from euros to Canadian dollars, has to follow this set of rules, but an exchange using digital currency to Canadian dollars doesn't have to follow this set of rules. If the risk is the same and they are providing a similar function, then by virtue of the idea of technological neutrality, it should be legislated similarly. 
**Mr. Babin-Tremblay**: It would be the opposite road to take than what they have been doing in New 
York. In New York, Benjamin Lawsky, the superintendent of financial services, came up with a proposal for 
bit licences, which was negatively received by the bitcoin industry for a number of reasons, most of them 
being that they are not technology-neutral. They are imposing additional requirements to bitcoin companies 
to comply with. That will most likely result in the isolation of New York and businesses moving out of the 
state of New York into friendlier jurisdiction, because it is impossible to comply from a technical perspective.
**Mr. Pouliot**: The important key point is not to discriminate against bitcoin just because it is a different 
technology, to look at it from the functions and uses of what people are doing with the bitcoins.
The community doesn't ask for much; I think I speak on behalf of most of the community when we say 
that we're not particularly inclined to go to government for extra help. But, for instance, some ministers in 
the U.K. have made positive statements regarding bitcoin. I'm speaking particularly of the U.K. where the 
minister of finance announced that he believed the U.K. could become a bitcoin hub. The community is 
receptive to government statements about bitcoin, so I think positive statements from our governments 
saying they think it's a great innovation -- and Canada does actually have a great potential in bitcoin -- just 
stating that fact, the symbolism of it, is enough.

Hi this is Francis from the Bitcoin Embassy in Montreal
Just a few details:
We gave out the 2 mBTC to people stopping by our booth in an enveloppe containing instructions on how to procure a wallet and import funds from the paper wallet.
We also made sure to explain that Bitcoin was a first and foremost an open-source software whose users are part of a decentralized peer-to-peer transaction network on which the bitcoins are the medium of exchange. 
We suggest they make small donations to various charity (we have suggested BitGive) so they get comfortable making transactions. Only then should the buy more.
We make sure to explain that a paper wallet with a public and private key is the least safest way to use bitcoin and they should in no circumstance use the public address on the paper wallet as their Bitcoin address.
We give them 14 days to import the paper wallets before we take them back. Not sure how many exactly we gave out, definitly in the hundreds.
We also gave out what I believe to be the first "What is Bitcoin?" informational flyer, which we got freshly from the printing press last Friday, courtesy of the Bitcoin Foundation Canada.
We will be hosting a similar event, which includes presentations (both the French and English TED talks on Bitcoin by Francis Pouliot and Eric Spano) AGAIN NEXT WEEK! There will be a very famous street art festival on our street, closed for pedestrian use only.

Seems to me that from a purely rational, self-interested behavior you actually have a strong incentive not to harm confidence in Bitcoin. 
Please explain in your own words why people who have major investments based on the integrity of the Bitcoin network do **not** have an incentive to perform a 51% attack.

Sure, valid point. But in this case, they shouldnt signal for BU and clearly ask for segwit on litecoin, no? Did any miner actually ask you specifically?
@_date: 2014-01-15 20:58:52
I think your two first points are valid criticisms and I would only say in reply that we did not want to over complicated some issues while at the same time having a space contraint.
As for your third point, I think we adress those issues in other places in the paper, for instance:
"It is important to note, however, that these risks are not so far
removed from those associated with cash—which remains
more anonymous than Bitcoin—or credit cards. It is also
important to put into perspective the scope of potentially
illegal actions carried out with the help of bitcoins, for example
by comparing these with the black market in general,
which is thought to total $2 trillion ($2,000 billion) in the
United States."
and, regarding anonymity, we adressed the issue in footnote 2:
"Although anonymity can be reinforced through a series of measures that users 
can take, it will never be perfect. Researchers at a Swiss university showed, 
using a simulation, that the profiles of around 40% of users could be discovered 
even if they were to adopt the confidentiality measures recommended by the 
Bitcoin community"

Interesting how they approach the Bitcoin community for their survey, the language used is quite telling. They want us to voluntarily disclode confidential and compromising information, with no guarantee of privacy, admitting in advance to sharing information with others, also suggesting the information would be given to government authorities, admitting there is risk of criminal organisations, all with no financial compensation.
Dear Madam/ Sir, 
You are kindly invited to participate in our research study:
Virtual Currency Exchanges - exposure to crime
You are invited to participate in a research study designed to examine (1) the **extent to which businesses involved in the exchange of virtual currencies to and from fiat are exposed to white-collar criminals** and (2) the safeguard measures proposed by the international community. 
Participation in this study will involve completing a survey about the (1) extent to which virtual currency exchanges do and should fall under AML/CFT regulations, (2) **the extent to which there is a real danger of them being approached by criminal organizations**, and (3) the extent to which mechanism to mitigate the **risk of exposure to criminal practices** exist, are known and are enforced. We anticipate that the completion of this questionnaire will take no more than 15 minutes. **You will receive no financial compensation for completing this survey.**
There are **no physical risks** associated with this study. **However, some questions may make you uncomfortable** and **there is the possible risk of loss of confidentiality**. **Every effort will be made to keep your information confidential; however, this cannot be guaranteed**. 
Although **this study will not benefit you personally**, we hope that our results will add to the knowledge about **the risks borne by businesses that exchange virtual currencies for fiat and about their exposure to criminal money and criminal organizations**. Further, this study will help shed light on and break some of the modern myths involving virtual currencies.
All of your responses will be held in confidence. Only the researchers involved in this study and those responsible for research oversight will have access to any information that could identify you. Your responses will be numbered and the code linking your number with your name **will be stored in a separate locked file cabinet** *(HAHA)*. Please note, however, that unlike information you provide to your doctor or lawyer, **the researchers can be compelled by a court to disclose this information**. When we publish any results from this study we will do so in a way that does not identify you unless we get your specific permission to do so. **We may also share the data with other researchers** so that they can check the accuracy of our conclusions but will only do so if we are confident that your confidentiality is protected.
Your participation in this study is voluntary. You are free to decline to participate, to end your participation at any time for any reason, or to refuse to answer any individual question. **Refusing to participate will involve no penalty.** *(seriously?)*

1) My point is that first of all, a medium of exchange does not have to be "generally accepted" to be a medium of exchange. 10 000, 50 000 or 500 000 merchants accepting Bitcoin does not change its essence as a form of money
2) I am not dodging the argument, there is no argument. Just because "stones" are seldom used in Canada does not mean it is not a valid unit of measurement. 
(edit: perhaps if I show here the wikipedia definition of Unit of Measurement, you'll see why its pretty useless to try and debate the fact that the bitcoin currency is a unit of measurement 
*A unit of measurement is a definite magnitude of a physical quantity, defined and adopted by convention or by law, that is used as a standard for measurement of the same physical quantity*)
3) Money should be a store of value that does not decrease in value over time. Therefore, you *do not* agree with me
4) Choose your wallet, choose which service you use, choose your security. I'm not a security expert either but I informed myself in order to be able to make the right decision. 
5) Nobody is forcing anyone to use Bitcoins. With greater liberty comes greater responsibility, and informing oneself before acquiring bitcoins is a responsibility.

@_date: 2015-05-10 20:33:31
This is extremely useful. We do a lot of large peer-to-peer, cash-based transactions (often buying bitcoins in bulk). This kind of tool can help us make sure that we are facilitating the sale of bitcoins from a hack, fraud, theft or scam. A lot of potential use. I've used their other software before, it was very cool.
Well done !

Scalability is crucial - if the network can't handle the rising number of transactions caused by more users than adoption will stop. Raising block size limit is important to keep the fees low and not loose some of the many great use-cases for micro-transactions.
BitPay, Coinbase and Bitstamp (and other businesses) have their own agenda, of course, which is making money. They make money by having more costumers. They have more costumers by converting the largest amount of people to Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-03-03 20:57:32
Amen. Once banks start cracking down on payment processors like they do with Bitcoin businesses, exchanges like Coinbase and Circle will need to completely sell out or be forced out. It is absolutely vital to establish scalable and economically efficient solutions to exchange cash-for-btc worldwide that have a equivalent level of service.
@_date: 2015-05-03 21:47:12
Bitcoin exchanges should not act as exchanges, banks, clearing houses and brokers / retail bitcoin merchants at the same time. It's a good thing to see specialized brokers taking on the role of providing bitcoins without the buyer having to go on an exchange.
@_date: 2015-01-20 18:14:51
The general idea is to assess miner's intentions, foster communication amongst them and try to limit potential surprises. Possible act as a platform for issue resolve / negotiation amongst key stakeholders.
Particularly: the BF could contact mining pool operators / large miners to assess their opinion on the proposed hard fork (gather information) before. It could also serve as a platform for these stakeholders to discuss their issues with / support for the fork. It could conduct studies on the potential effects, have a vulgarized version for home miners and the general public, and publish briefs on the matter. It can also organize virtual round-tables or, if necessary, physical round-tables or conferences. 
Since I'm not a core dev myself or a large miner this is what I propose with an outsider's perspective - I would need to get in touch with stakeholders before suggesting such measures to get their own suggestions on how they wish to proceed.

That's highly unlikely, even if there was widespread knowledge of Bitcoin (there isin't), there is no way to exchange that much fiat. Bitcoin brokers and ATM operators couldn't possibly run a business profitably there without fluid payment channels for fiat (there aren't) or high volume of people selling coins (maybe, but I doubt it).
What Greece needs is a comprehensive scheme of import / export with Bitcoin to help people that have stashes of cash get it out of the country in the form of Bitcoin.

You mention that a lightning network for a specific asset would not be necessary because we already have trusted third-parties (issuers), but those third-parties are not trusted for the same reason. They are not trusted to allow for censorship-resistant transactions but to redeem for counterparty. It is perfectly conceivable that, for example in the case of a fiat-backed colouredcoin, a lightning network of that coin would be highly desirable. 
But yes, most likely is that people will prefer a form a of lightning network for bearer assets and payment hobs for colored coins. 
The problem is how would a coloredcoins explorer know that a transaction has taken place within a payment channel if it's not broadcasted yet? Is this possible with the existing implementations like Colu?

The mission of the Bitcoin Foundation is to support the technical infrastructure of Bitcoin. This can be done by financing core dev salary, training programs for new developers, taking a leadership role in hard forks, coordinating stakeholders when new improvements are implemented and, generally speaking, supporting technical projects that add value to the Bitcoin protocol and benefit end-users.
In order to be sucessful, the BF has to reduce its current mandate. By doing to much and diverting resources it risks not achieving any of the mandate it has given itself, considering that there are competing organizations taking care of its other mandates.
I believe strongly in non-contradiction and I'd appreciate if you could point out the points in my platform which contradict my desire to see the BF successful.

Hello Brett - since you've already asked this question in another post ( and I've already replied, I hope you don't mind I'll just copy-paste my previous reply here:
Since Board directors do not receive a salary, you'll be please to know that your dues will definitely NOT be used for gambling!
I receive a part of my salary in Bitcoin and use Bitcoin and a day-to-day basis for many reasons. Pragmatism, of course, because it is more convenient. By principle, because as a Bitcoin advocate I believe in putting my money where my mouth is. I also like to truly experience Bitcoin in the fullest manner to understand its shortcomings. Fortunately, I am VERY aware of the risks and since I am young, without debt, children or a mortage, I can afford to take these risks.
From the outside, it may seem like the Foundation has enough resources to do a lot - education, lobbying and technical development at the same time. However, sadly, this is not the case. In addition to the decline in price, a lot of money has been lost by trying to do too much. There are many non-profit organizations that can take care of education and lobbying but there is only one non-profit organization that has the capacity to help development (at present time).
I agree 100% that membership will flourish with a plan that appeals to a broad audience. I only think that the only plan that CAN appeal to a broad audience is technical development.
Thanks for the comments :)
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:38:58

STATEMENT FROM THE ORIGINAL BITCOIN EMBASSY:
The Bitcoin Embassy, a three-story building located in Montreal, is the first physical space in the world dedicated to the promotion of Bitcoin. When we launched in July 2013, we created the concept of the Bitcoin Embassy because we wanted to give a physical home to a digital community. 
Following our early success other groups popped-up all over the world which shared the same characteristic of being located in a permanent physical space dedicated to Bitcoin.
Some of these groups contacted us and asked if it was okay to use our name, branding and logo. We have always accepted these requests and it has been our pride and joy to witness the rising number of groups calling themselves the Bitcoin Embassy.
It has recently come to our attention that a group using the website bitcoinembassy.io claims to own the trademark to the Bitcoin Embassy name and logo, as reported today by Coindesk. They also claim that to be recognized as a Bitcoin Embassy you need to contact an entity called “BCF CAPITAL”.
 They also seem to insinuate that Bitcoin Embassies need some form of endorsement to be recognized as such, presumably also from “BCF CAPITAL”.
THIS IS COMPLETELY FALSE
There is no trademark whatsoever on the Bitcoin Embassy name and brand. You do not need anybody’s permission to start your own Bitcoin Embassy, certainly not from bitcoinembassy.io which, in any case, does not appear to be a real legal or formal entity.
We consider any attempt to trademark the Bitcoin Embassy name or logo a violation of the Bitcoin community spirit.
We have no issue whatsoever with having a website being a registry of institutions called Bitcoin Embassy, but we do have issue when the operators of such websites insinuating to have a monopoly over the brand that we have worked so hard to build.
We hope this is only a misunderstanding but we would like to clarify once and for all that
-any group can call themselves a Bitcoin Embassy
-there is no official Bitcoin Embassy network whose membership requires endorsement
-there is no trademark over the Bitcoin Embassy name and logo, namely the “B” surrounded by laurel leaves, which we created in 2013 and which we did not trademark
For any questions or details, you can contact me at francis

I'm not a developer so I can't myself help to improve the Bitcoin tech infrastructure - this saddens me as a Bitcoin advocate who realises the immense power of Bitcoin and the crucial importance of development.

I myself conduct projects to promote Bitcoin adoption on a daily-basis and I think it's absolutely important that people like me do this full-time. However, I've come to the conclusion that Bitcoin adoption projects are more effective on a local scale (e.g. local Bitcoin Embassies / Bitcoin spaces or individual efforts). Also, it is in the interest of private Bitcoin businesses to promote Bitcoin adoption - if only to increase their costumer base.
So I guess I agree with you but I simply think the Foundation is not the right medium to promote Bitcoin adoption - at least not now, not when so many resources are needed for development and so few are available.
But don't forget that the scalability and viability of the Bitcoin technology are pre-requisites for adoption - and this can only be ensured by a healthy technological development process.

The only plan that can possibly appeal to the broadest audience is the plan which implements the smallest-common denominator of the interest of all participants in the Bitcoin technology: ensuring that it actually works

What he is doing incorrectly is going on Circle or Coinbase. They require a lot of verification that can be slow and usually you can only start off with small amounts. Making an account on a major exchange will also likely take more time and your ransom might increase. Are you in Canada or USA? If in canada contact me info and you'll have your BTC in a couple of hours. If in USA you should withdraw the cash and find the nearest Bitcoin ATM. Note that some BTC sellers (like CoinCafe in the US) will not sell to you if you mention ransomware. 
You should also look at Paxful and Localbitcoins. Limits are usually low for most payment methods because sellers are afraid of chargebacks. If it's $500 US and over, your best bet is cash deposit. For large amounts, avoid cash-in-person unless form a trusted source (e.g. a physical Bitcoin exchange).

Hello Brett,
Since Board directors do not receive a salary, you'll be please to know that your dues will definitely NOT be used for gambling!
I receive a part of my salary in Bitcoin and use Bitcoin and a day-to-day basis for many reasons. Pragmatism, of course, because it is more convenient. By principle, because as a Bitcoin advocate I believe in putting my money where my mouth is. I also like to truly experience Bitcoin in the fullest manner to understand its shortcomings. Fortunately, I am VERY aware of the risks and since I am young, without debt, children or a mortage, I can afford to take these risks.
From the outside, it may seem like the Foundation has enough resources to do a lot - education, lobbying and technical development at the same time. However, sadly, this is not the case. In addition to the decline in price, a lot of money has been lost by trying to do too much. There are many non-profit organizations that can take care of education and lobbying but there is only one non-profit organization that has the capacity to help development (at present time).
I agree 100% that membership will flourish with a plan that appeals to a broad audience. I only think that the only plan that CAN appeal to a broad audience is technical development.
Thanks for the comments :)

I also think that as well - in the USA there is the Digital Chamber of Commerce and Coin Center already fulfilling this role. In Canada, there is the Bitcoin Foundation Canada and the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada. There are numerous organizations lobbying in many other jurisdictions. If the Bitcoin Foundation engages in lobbying, they would be duplicating the efforts of other groups who, in contrast, are not spending ressources on technical development.
@_date: 2016-03-07 22:22:36
Well some of the core devs were there and made great efforts to communicate, explain their points of view, find a compromise and provide technical arguments. Two of the Bitcoin CEOs that wrote blog posts basically told everyone present that Core devs are doing a terrible job and that they should be replacede. Talk about a massive buzzkill... I wouldn't even bother writing about it if I was a core developer. My prescription to core devs: avoid any social media and forum for a few weeks and focus on work.
I wrote about it, I'm not a developer but I'm a supporter of the capacity increase roadmap and, generally speaking, a huge fan of the core development team:
"I think the community should know that as a group, at the Satoshi Roundtable, a majority of participants sat down together and attempted to identify points that to modify the Hong Kong Agreement in a way that might satisfy its opposing parties. The participants to this exercise included both proponents of both Classic and Core.
The intent was not to have some sort of "backroom deal" or binding agreement whatsoever, but identify some items additional to the Hong Kong agreement that could help bring the opposing camps together. I regard it as an exercise whose positive outcome was at minimum to identify the specific points of contention (identifying these is the key to moving forward together as a community). Personal comment: I had not felt such a wave of optimism in regards the scaling debate in a long time.
The imperative was to agree on a process that satisfies the following requirements:
- Increase the throughput of the Bitcoin network by 2x-3x yearly for the next two years.
- Reach some consensus and achieve some form of unity/truce before the halving.
The four items proposed were:
- Clarify the language concerning the hard fork parameters. "Around 2MB and no more than 3MB" would be replaced by simply "2MB", as proposed by the Bitcoin Classic implementation.
- Implement a "readiness signaling mechanism". Essentially, wallets would "signal" their capacity/readiness to handle a fork. This lays the foundation for a system in which users are able to voice their opinion on certain key issues. It's not voting, just a method to poll the wallets.
- Modify the miner threshold from 75%, as proposed by classic, to 95%, as proposed by Core.
- Move up the estimated activation date. Having readiness signaling showing a vast majority of wallets ready to upgrade would stomp out some of the risks associated to a quick hard fork. A specific date was not mentioned, but it is my understanding (and this is my personal impression, not by any means something factual) that we were talking about cutting 6 months. If any participants to the exercise feel I've misrepresented the points, please tell me. I did not write this down, it's form memory.
After having drafted these points, the group asked a Bitcoin Classic developer for his opinion. He stated that there was no consensus, but did not elaborate. After lunch, the CEO's of two prominent Bitcoin companies were invited to comment on this proposal and argued against it on the grounds that this was still "too vague" and that, regardless, the issue had more to do with the identity of the developers than the scaling process.
I'll just say that according to an informal "show of hands", most of the Core roadmap / existing Hong Kong agreement proponents present at the meeting were in favor. Many of the people you would refer to as "thought leaders" of Bitcoin Core were in favor and contributing actively to the exercise."
To be clear, this was **a political attempt to find a political solution to a political problem**. The "hard fork now!" team provided no technical argument at any point during the debate.

The Bitcoin Foundation, as an association of individuals and corporate stakeholders in Bitcoin, IS part of the Bitcoin community. 
The Bitcoin Foundation **does not** and (obviously) **should not** seek to have a monopoly over the core development process (which I assume is what you mean by *power*). I'm perfectly happy to see BitPay, Blockstream and individuals also involved in the process. In fact, the more the better.
As far as I know, the core devs working for the BF are not slaves and they can quit their job whenever they want.
Also, "The Community" is not an entity, it is a collection of individuals and groups. Nobody can ever know what "the community" wants.
Regarding mining:
The centralization of the mining infrastructure is the result of free-market interactions (including the investment made in the development of ASIC tech). What can the Bitcoin Foundation possibly do against that? It cannot control the market and cannot dictate who mines and who doesn't. Moreover, changes in the protocol that would threaten current large miners would be a disaster since they would obviously not accept thse changes.
I'm sure entrepreneurs will find solutions to make home-mining profitable and convenienent, such as more energy-efficient chips, heat-recapture and appliance mining.

I think this is the wrong way to think about it. I would think of it rather in terms of volume. If you don't use your coins a lot, I'd go with just a stack of paper wallet for savings (e.g. create a booklet of 15 encrypted paper wallets with copies safely stored, e.g. in bank vault or at parent's house with 1 BTC each what you can sweep for spending).
If you spend bitcoins a lot, I think 5 bitcoins going through your wallet per month is justified with a trezor.
Phone wallets can be extremely safe.

I have a positive view of Litecoin - I have a few myself. I believe in the process of competition and it is important for Bitcoin users to have alternatives in order for the Bitcoin ecosystem to always feel the need to improve itself.

Nothing can be done. In Canada, we all get more or less the same letter stating: "BANK periodically conducts a review of its customers and as a result of this review we have determined that we can no longer support your account. In the agreement, you agreed that we can shut down your account at any time."
Then they give you a phone number, which when you call will have a human robotically repeat the contents of the letter.
One of the account had had, I think one or two transactions (wire transfers inbound from another bank account) so definitely nothing suspicious.
One I went to a well known bank (Bank of Montreal). I mentionned specifically that we were working with Blockchain technology. They pulled out a high-risk client form specific for Bitcoin businesses. At my request, the account manager contacted her boss for a clarification. Over the phone, she was told that BMO no longer allows accounts for Bitcoin businesses.
What can we do about it? Nothing really, it's widely known by our political class and regulators that banks act discriminantly against Bitcoin businesses, even the ones that are not involved in Bitcoin trading.
Just have to find a smaller bank, credit union type or bank specializing in high risk merchants (that will gouge you with fees).

I think you make a very good point that although it's likely that a lot of businesses will participate in hub-and-spoke networks, we are also very likely to see mesh networks of lightning hubs.
I have a question regarding LN though: if I initiate a transaction to the address of a recipient that I don't know, would there be a way to at the same time create a request for him to join a payment channel? How does that work in practice? 
I would be really cool if for instance wallets by default asked their users if they wanted to open a payment channel when they send a payment, or if the recipient could in a payment request specify that he wants a payment channel to be opened. 
That could be a good way to foster the development of a strong mesh network

If you're looking for someone quick, and easy: check us out satoshicounter.com. We do OTC so our rates are +/- 4% on top of coinbase price but you don't have to worry about market depth and it's very fast (24h and you have the funds).
Otherwise, I can only recommend Quadrigacx or Kraken as trading platforms. Quadriga is more expensive but sign-up is fast and withdrawals are processed fairly quickly. Kraken I've yet to try it but they have a very good reputation.

Yes but payment protocol is not supported by the most popular wallet (which incidentally is the one that has the most problem with fees) blockchain.info and I'm not sure it's widely accepted yet.
If all wallets already implement BIP21, it's an easier fix (although this is the wallet devs' faults). 
As far as I can tell you also can't specify a mandatory fee with BIP70 right? 
@_date: 2017-03-30 01:44:47
No! 
But if we're at the point where Bitcoin Core shipped a version that blacklisted someone's coins in all likelihood that would be the time where I would be closing my Bitcoin services and working on other applied crypto / blockchain / fintech stuff.
Edit: to be quite honest, also if BU were to take over I would also probably close down (or sell) or temporarily put on hold my Bitcoin services. My heart just wouldn't be in it anymore.
@_date: 2016-01-08 18:23:18
You can't expect BitPay to do otherwise. Cooperating with Chainanalysis might also just mean using Chainalysis' services, probably not an obscure conspiracy/plot. As long as Bitcoin is not fungible, it is a bug that will be exploited. There needs to be a systematic fix for this. Why would they *not* want to accumulate as much info as possible on their users? This is not something that I condone, but I can see why it is in their self-interest to do so and since Bitcoin offers them this capability we must always assume that companies will take advantage of it.

When Bitcoin becomes fungible, it will finally achieve the status of perfect money.

How did your father pay? If it was by paypal, simply do a chargeback asap. Tell him to contact the bank if it was as a wire. If it was by credit card, contact Visa / Mastercard and try to cancel. If it was by cash, no luck there. Hopefully it wasn't in Bitcoin since you can't ever claw those payments back.

They have completely lost their mind.
Not only have they absolutely sucked at maintaining the entire Bitcore library, which resulted in at least 2-3 companies having to fork it to continue with their services without re-writing everything from scratch, including my own company as sell as Satoshi Labs.

I just had a look at the specs, quite impressive. I have to admit I previously dismissed Bitcoin Knots as simply a novelty side-project. 
Also, thanks for allowing -spamfilter=0, as I don't personally think that Mastercoin is spam and would myself like to validate Mastercoin (e.g. Safecoin, etc.) transactions.
A lot of the enhancements seem quite logical and non-controversial to me. Any thoughts on why they are not in Bitcoin Core? I suspect lack of testing resources?
Looks like a lot of enhancements to the GUI, I'll have a look at that. As more of a product person, I think a good GUI lowers the cost for users to validate their own transactions.

I know most people think this has to do with KYC / AML, but that's not the whole picture. Almost every non-cash payment method is reversible. Even wire transfers, bank transfers, email money transfers, western union payments can be reversed at some point. 
Bitcoin sellers will normally ask for some information to identify their customers as a method of deterring fraud and/or to gain information if arbitration is needed.
Asking for phone number (which allows sellers to verify with databases if it's a burner phone or not) and ID (allows sellers to verify if matches phone number records and physical address) greatly reduces the chances of chargeback, and increases the chances that the financial institution will rule in favor of the merchant in case of chargeback.

A miner fee is a tiny amount in Bitcoin that you can attach to a transaction. The miner who confirms that transaction will collect the fee. When the network is overloaded with transactions, the miners may choose to include transaction with fees in priority over transaction with lower fees or no fees. 0.0002 btc should suffice under normal conditions (that is priority), 0.0009 is ideal *right now* (high priority)
@_date: 2015-07-03 18:12:14

We used to recommend blockchain.info in 2013. We stopped mid-2014. We are now mid-2015. They don't even have BIP32 implementation. This is not serious.
I can understand why they would make a bidding war between exchanges to get to the top, but wallets.... that's just terrible. No wonder the VC-backed hosted - custodial wallets are on top and not the actual GOOD wallets like Mycelium and Electrum.

Transcript (I am not a transcripting expert):
"Antonop: What do you think about the idea that consensus isin't something that miners do, but consensus is something that happens in five different places, or by five different constituencies, (devs, miners, exchanges, merchants, wallet users) and they have to remain at this precarious balance.
Pair: I agree with that. The users ultimately have the final say on what they will use, it is as simple as that. So the users in Bitcoin are going to determine the future of Bitcoin, not the miners, not anybody else and if the users decide that "you know what this blockchain doesn't work for us" they will use litecoin or a fork of Bitcoin that enforces the kinds of consensus rules they want.  So the most important thing are the users. **I really like this idea of a user-activated-soft-fork**, followed by a miner activation*. I think if you step back from that and think about it at a high level what it's basically saying is that we want to build consensus amongt users that there is a new set of rules that we want to enforce on the network and the users are expressing their desire for that in one form or another. The users are are saying: "we like this, we want this" and when that becomes clear the miners will start building a blockchain that enforces those rules. The miners have a simple economic decision to make: "is it profitable for me to adopt this new set of consensus rules or not?" and it's it's profitable, they will enforce it and if not they won't. To me that is the right way to go about building consensus. I'm interested to see where that avenue takes us. If you like at BIP9 it's entirely focused on miner activation. If you look at the more recent idea of UASF it's basically saying: "let's start with getting the users on board and only after that do we get to the miner activation"".

Exactly. Bankers invite me to speak at lunches on blockchain technology yet serve me, my friends and my community bank account closure letters. They are completely clueless. One Canadian bank representative even told me to "not mention the word disruptive and not talk about Bitcoin, just Blockchain".
Blockchain will not make their systems more efficient. The blockchain can't improve banks' efficiency, it can only improve the banking system by removing some of the tasks and responsibilities from banks.

On February 21st, 2016, in Hong Kong’s Cyberport, representatives from the bitcoin industry and members of the development community have agreed on the following points:
- We understand that SegWit continues to be developed actively as a soft-fork and is likely to proceed towards release over the next two months, as originally scheduled. 
- We will continue to work with the entire Bitcoin protocol development community to develop, in public, a safe hard-fork based on the improvements in SegWit. 
- The Bitcoin Core contributors present at the Bitcoin Roundtable commit to make a good faith effort to have an implementation of such a hard-fork ready for merge within three months after the release of SegWit.
- This hard-fork is expected to include features which are currently being discussed within technical communities, including an increase in the maximum effective block size, to more than 2 MB and less than 4 MB, and will only be adopted with a broad support across the entire Bitcoin community.
- We will run a SegWit release in production by the time such a hard-fork is released in a version of Bitcoin Core. 
- We will not run Bitcoin Classic. We will only run Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems in production for the foreseeable future.
- We are committed to scaling technologies which use block space more efficiently, such as Schnorr multisig.
Based on the above points, the timeline will likely follow the below dates.
- SegWit is expected to be released in April 2016.
- The code for the hard-fork will therefore be available by July 2016.
- If there is strong community support, the hard-fork activation will likely happen around July 2017.
- The undersigned support this roadmap.

I don't think going all-in on Bitcoin is a terrible idea. I'm all-in on Bitcoin and it makes me sleep very well at night knowing that my funds are safe and that I am in full control.
Specifically considering that PayPal just froze $25 000 for 180 days (account closure), Bitcoin volatility is nothing compared to asset confiscation.
@_date: 2016-09-09 05:10:22
Transfers are not slower than they were before, and there are new tools which help detect attempts to double spend, meaning that in certain conditions it's safe to conclude transactions without confirmation. Also now with "Replace-by-fee" transactions, it's possible to "unfreeze" transactions not being confirmed and have that attempted replacement of the transaction be diplayed with a special flag.
Bitcoin is much better now than it's ever been, sometimes it's hard to even graps how much progress has, and is being, made.
@_date: 2016-09-09 17:50:15

Yeah for sure, Bitcoin was always meant to be cash for the internet, but cash is also great as a payment method.

How can this possibly be seen as a surprise?
This community was highly supportive of Olivier Jansens and he was consequently elected to the board. His intention was clear from the start: remove all funding for core development. 
Other candidates like Michael Perklin and myself opted for remove all other non "mission-critical" activities and wanted the Foundation to concentrate on core dev.

We kept all the private keys (this was **explicitely** written on the paper wallet). Students have 2 weeks to redeem the coins (again, very clearly stated). If they haven't, we sweep all the unimported private keys. We use those bitcoins for a Bitcoin raffle for McGill students (up to 100$). If there is any money left, we will use it to buy bitcoin stickers, pins and stuff like that to give away.
Haven't checked in a few days but around 25% of the btc were claimed in the first 24h

Mr. Armstrong seems pretty confident that the patents will be granted. Not a lawyer, but it seems to me that it would create a pretty devastating precedent and lead to an arms race to patent every potential use-case of crypto, with other patent holders not so ethical. However, good on him to explain his decision, it is perfectly rational (however unfortunate the patent system is).
However, I am curious to see how these pledges will be respect if, for instance, a majority stake is purchase by another company (or the company is sold). One of the logical exits for Coinbase is to be acquired by a major international bank / financial institution that wants to get in the crypto market. Not sure they will be so "open-source" minded.

This is a very "common" idea in the cryptocurrency space and can be achieved in many ways. There are problems with creating a brand new cryptocurrency (thus a new blockchain), mainly due to the consensus mechanism used to record asset transfers. For cryptocurrencies to be decentralized, this must be achieved through "cryptoeconomics" such as proof-of-work (mining) in Bitcoin or proof-of-stake in Bitshares. If you create a new cryptocurrency, you have all the dynamics related to cryptoeconomics to worry about.
Many banks and financial institutions are currently experimenting with this right now.
The best way to do this is to use additional protocols that act as layers on top of Bitcoin such as Colored Coins or CounterParty.
You can literally create your company shares in minutes using Colored Coins. However, in almost no circumstance will this be considered legally valid. For now it's a great way to represent equity/stake/contribution in a small, "off-the-books" project.

This is ridiculous. I would not store even 1 satoshi on these coins. Security should be absolutely 0/5 stars. I suspect OP is selling these on secondary markets.
They are at best a cool piece of Bitcoin memorabilia. IMO they are in effect overpriced precious metals. At worst, they are an elaborate scam to steal bitcoins.
Whoever generated the private keys could have kept a copy of them VERY easily. What kind of criteria did OP use to determine this was 4.5/5 for security?
NEVER store bitcoins on a private key you did not generate yourself! Do NOT store ANY coins on a Cassasius coin! If you buy a cassasius coin loaded with BTC, remove them immediately and keep it for its collectible value.

Something not mentioned, for the first time in history, we have self-enforced property rights. 
It is understood in classic liberal though that certain rights are inherent to one's existence as a human being, and are not awarded by government. Property right is such a right. Previously, the rule of law and third parties such as courts were needed to enable and protect this right. Thrid parties were needed to this to be enforced.
With Bitcoin, ownership of money is defined solely by knowledge of a very large number. Combined with censorship resistance (e.g. all that you need to do to enact your right of ownership and hand over ownership to someone else is to broadcasts a message) and you have absolute and irrevocable, perfect property rights.

No, because the miners doesn't lose any profit if exchanges accept segwit blocks or not. He can only gain more by signalling for segwit.

My key take-aways:
There has been a lot of hype about Blockchain 2.0 (or Bitcoin 2.0 as it was known before 2015) such as Ethereum, Bitshares and now distributed ledger technology, **but there is still so much innovation to be done in the good old Bitcoin 1.0. Before we go beyond Bitcoin, let's exploit Bitcoin to its fullest capacity.**
The cryptocurrency community (now blockchain industry) spends a lot of time thinking about what we can do and too little time thinking about what is needed. Not to say that R&amp;D and experimenting is bad (it's great!) but we have an actual economic revolution to deliver which can immediately benefit real human beings in real circumstances.

You're losing a competitive advantage over your competitors by doing this - you should advertise loud and clear that you accept Bitcoin to increase you customer base.

I bought the domain and am pointing it to an open-source static github site. I had not talked to Samson Mow, the UASF hatmaker, before getting involved (and I he wasn't working for blocksream back then if I recall).

It's insane that a few CEOs of perhaps the largest Bitcoin companies have publicly and (more vehemently) privately called for the volunteer Bitcoin core software contributors to be "fired" or similar condescending / derogatory / negative language.
Given how much Bitcoin relies on the work of these volunteers, the developer-bashing culture that is being perpetrated by a vocal minority of well-funded trolls is to me frankly frightening.
We've often discussed how to get more developers involved in the project: better documentation, outreach, grants, etc. But I think the most important the community can do is grant them the respect and appreciation they deserve. 
P.s. most of these guys are accessible via Slack, email, twitter, etc. Once in a while, we should all send them a small message of gratitude. I know that they appreciate.

Rational, self-interested, profit-seeking and risk averse miners should signal for Segwit. If not:
1. Miners are after something other than profit, i.e. control and power of Bitcoin. This is perhaps a long-term strategy to increase their profits by leveraging their control of Bitcoin.
2. The payout for not mining segwit blocks is inherently bigger than lost revenue, for that specific miner (e.g. ASICBoost).
3. Bitcoin incentive structure is broken

As a matter of principle I don't encourage those artefacts since an important lesson for new users is that solely the knowledge of a very large number (private key) is the what guarantees ownership, and the only way to guarantee that you are the only person on earth with that knowledge is to generate the number yourself.

I am absolutely proud to have almost all my assets in Bitcoin. Everyone tells me to diversify but I've done my research for 2 years, I'm an ex-economic policy analyst and I stand by my choice with confidence. When my current accounts gets filled up with fiat I feel like I need to cash out my monopoly money for real value and I always try to have as little CAD$ as possible. You have my full support!

Bitcoin is an alternative monetary system which exists entirely outside of the government framework. It is a tool specifically designed to circumvent barriers to trade.
Bitcoin is by its very nature "apolitical", even "anti-political". This "anti-political" aspect of Bitcoin is an important component of the Libertarian movement. 
Those who think you can separate Bitcoin from principles of liberty and free-markets are just kidding themselves.

The users acticate segwit, and the miners produce blocks to satisfy the users. If the miners don't produce segwit blocks, they are intentionally cutting out a portion of their client base. If they do signal segwit, their blocks are compatible to all clients.
Think of it like this: say you are a cattle farmer / butcher. If you are a Halal butcher, all the restaurants that offer halal for their users will come to you. All things being equal, non-halal restaurants don't see the difference (halal rules are stricter, like segwit soft fork) and they are also potential clients.
However, non-halal butchers are rejecting all the halal restaurants as clients.
So basically, miners activate segwit themselves because users did it first, and they want the fees and block reward from mining blocks that are validated and propagated by the users.

For those wondering: I use a credit card to pay for most things online (negative fiat balance) and pay that debt off with Bitcoin using (my own startup) Bylls.com - I also sometimes sell $BTC for cash. I pay lots of staff in Bitcoin, I often ask my friends to pay stuff for me and I pay them back in Bitcoin. I use Bitcoin pre-paid debit cards (it's technically kind of a bank account that the debit card issuer has as sub-account for you on their books but in their name, but oh well).
Why don't I have bank accounts? Mostly because I had so many shut down after doing local bitcoin trading back in the day, and then getting company accounts shut down, and also because when you're all-in on Bitcoin you don't need one.

I think it is a wise course of action to follow the principle of least privilege and that given Gavin's contribution status this course of action seems correct.
However, this should probably have been done earlier. It seems to me that this course of action was undertaken now rather than earlier because the Craig Wright drama brought in the necessary political capital, which could make it seem like a political decision.
Regardless, it takes tremendous leadership to navigate Bitcoin in these extremely agitated seas and decisions must be made and I think we should stand by the captain on this one.

TL;DR The Bitcoin Embassy is hosting a halving day party at its HQ in Montreal :)
What an incredible journey it has been for Bitcoin, and for the Bitcoin Embassy! In July 2013, we launched the world's first physical Bitcoin hub and Canada's most active non-profit organization. Three years later, we are thrilled to invite you to our awesome headquarters to celebrate, as a community, the most important event in the Bitcoin calendar: the Bitcoin halving!
EVENT INFO
- You are welcome to invite guests
- Beers will be served, but you can bring your own if you prefer
- Maximum 150 guests
- Exact halving time is still unknown
Halving info + timing
The Bitcoin block rewards are designed so that every 210,000 blocks (roughly every four years), the rate at which the mining process produces new bitcoins is set to halve. Currently the miners earn 25 bitcoins per block. Starting block  the mining reward will become 12.5 bitcoins.
To mark this remarkable event, and to celebrate so many blocks of successful bitcoin transactions against all odds, we are hosting The Halving Party for members of the cryptocurrency community. The entry is absolutely free, however we require that you RSVP to put yourself on the guestlist, so we know who to expect.
Since the actual block times are random, we have given up on trying to predict exactly what time the halving will take place; instead, we will start the party 25 blocks prior to block  and will continue the party well past The Halving!

Absolutely! This is already a something we can do "ad hoc", and it will be put in the 2.0 version of the app soon. Essentially we are able to pull EFTs from your employer and pay you in Bitcoin.

It's not just about immutability, but distribution of coins (ethereum could have the longest PoW but it would still be a pre-mine) and decentralization (censorship resistance).
But yes, I agree that using the term "you should use the chain with the longest valid proof-of-work if you're looking for immutability" is better than just blindly pushing for Bitcoin as the best blockchain platform, since most of the people interested in "blockchain tech" are **only** interested in immutability, not censorship resistance or fairness.

In the blog post: "That means the technology covered by Blockstream's patents is freely available for use without having to pay a licensing fee or risk litigation. "
In the FAQ we can read:
"What does this cover? Are all Blockstreamers' projects under this pledge now?
This covers only **technologies invented and patented by Blockstream employees as part of their work for the company**, or which have otherwise come under Blockstream's ownership or control. Any patents owned by Blockstream employees on their own personal projects that have not been explicitly assigned to the company are not covered under this pledge. We know that many of the projects people contribute to, including other projects in the Bitcoin community, are already under terms that allow the work to be freely reused by the public, and we encourage others in our industry to follow the same licensing practices for any patents they may hold."
Is there some public information on what specific technologies are covered? Are some elements of the elements project considered to be Blockstream technology? Are technologies developped by Blockstream employees that are not specifically under terms that state it can be used by the public by default patented by Blockstream?
Maybe clearly describe some technologies that are **explicitely** targeted by the Blockstream patent?
In any case, I don't see this as a bad thing, depending on the scopes of technology involved. With all the work Blockstream is putting in the ecosystem, not even mentioning the resources at their disposal, and considering a legitimate moral and legal case for defensive patents, Blockstream probably the best corporate entity to set up these patents.
