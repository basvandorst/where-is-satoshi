If to summarize the comments here from different perspective:
Bitcoin is a technology (like any other currency or money). Currently it is used by early adopters . For Bitcoin to become mainstream it needs to be significantly better than existing currency.
There are two ways that it will happen:
1. Bitcoin improves (it happens slowly but surely)
2. Current monetary system getting worse (inflation, taxation, etc)
IMHO,  is the main driver. Another currency collapse or USD hyperinflation and bitcoin is probably mainstream

Generally speaking, POS security is based on choosing individuals randomly to validate transactions. There is a direct connection between how much you stake to how much you contribute to the network security (thus to your reward)

Also micro payments and coffee payments are less than 20% of the value transferred on the economy . It looks like 90% of coins compete on being the leading medium of exchange, while in practice it is "race to the bottom "
You have Bitcoin to store value and do large transfers (which $3 fee and a hour wait is not a big deal), and use the current low fee shitcoin or visa to buy your coffee .

But feeeeezzzz
20% of the transactions carry 80% of the value. This is Bitcoin  and also bank transfers, gold and SDRs
80% of transactions carry 20% of the value. This is: LTB, BCH,ETH,DASH,ETC and basically any other barley utilized crypto that can be easily converted to btc. Also, credit cards, debit cards and cash works fine

I think we are in agreement 
2nd tier solutions (like: LN) is the way to go. Bitcoin or any other coin as itself cannot support both high value and high volume, Bitcoin decides to support high value and solves transaction volume with LN
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:51:07
It could in theory. However, larger market cap, adaptation and better liquidity allows you to transfer high value transactions that other alt coins might struggle with 
Also, when you deal with big money brand and security (real and perceived ) is key
Practically, as you go down the top 10 list the amount of value that can be transferred going down fast. When you reach low top 10 you are in the few hundreds usd or less domain , where fees really move the needle

Carrying 80% of the value in the world is not exactly a small thing, and it's hard to see how Bitcoin success in this area leaves Bitcoin with a few niche cases. 
My point is that it validates the overall strategy. Build the base that carries most of the value (but small percentage of transactions), and build second tier solutions on top of it (lighting network for example). 
Also, I am arguing that you can't have both: Your coin is either focused on carrying massive value or carrying massive number of transactions .

Government welfare is not the only way to help the poor. In fact, it is arguably one of the worse ways (e.g. 50+ year of US war on poverty, and nothing much changed)
If “society “ agrees to help the poor, leave more money in the hand of people, cut ineffective government and you have more resources to help the poor.
Social Security has little to do with “society” or helping the poor. It is a money taken by force and redistributed based on a decision of small group of people

Thank you so much for this AMA
Bitcoin Forks! 
1. Bitcoin was forked to BCH, when a taxable event happened? On the day of the fork? When I move BCH to a different address? When I sell BCH?
2. How do I calculate the "purchase " price? Is it zero (because I got it for free), is it the price of BTC at the moment of the fork?
3. What is going on with all the other BTC forks. Do I owe taxes if I don't care about them (not planning on selling, just ignoring them)? What if there is a fork I am not even aware of?
Thank you so much 
@_date: 2017-09-26 18:33:41
You can outlaw cryptos, for sure
But if you look at previous examples where government declared war on something, you might suspect that bitcoin would increase in value.

"By decree" doesn't mean necessarily "nothing of value backing it", it means "by order from group of people that own more guns than you" (in theory they can force everyone to use gold coin)
Fiat currency is essentially backed by violence. In the US, if you don't have USDs, you are unable to pay taxes, therefore there is going to be a serious act of violence against you by those who set the "decree". A very sound "currency backing" as I see it

Drugs (and bitcoin) are solutions to problems or at least satisfying specific needs
Outlawing drugs (or bitcoin) doesn't make those need go away, it simply drives people to seek different solutions 
Currently bitcoin is a solution for set of problems (currency debasement, cross boarder remittances , theft by government etc). Outlawing bitcoin doesn't make those problems go away. 
The question is whether there are other legal solutions to those problems, and how better are they compared to bitcoin (in  additional of the friction caused by outlawing bitcoin)
I think the answer is that in most cases Bitcoin is still better (with physical gold as a second runner)
