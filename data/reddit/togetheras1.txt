For risk management so you don't lose all your coins if they "get hacked", you can use  and if your goal is to just maintain your btc cash value. Then only load up 10% of your balance and trade it on futures using your trading system at 10x Leverage. Like that, your trading your system as if your using 100% of your balance and if the exchange "gets hacked", at worst, you only lost 10% of your btc.

If you want to obfuscate the source address. You can occasionally use blockchain.info's shared coin feature when your releasing your coins onto new ownership and this may make things slightly better then a direct transfer.

Its more dangerous betting with bitcoins because of the psychological denomination.
In real life, betting $250 dollar to $500 dollar hands seems crazy.
But in btc, your betting 0.5btc to 1btc which looks psychologically less. 
Never gamble with btc.

Easiest is to find a trader with good rep on localbitcoins and ask him to do it wallet to wallet in person. Most traders prefer to send directly to you to avoid the localbitcoins fee.

Say you have coins sitting in your blockchain account. You want to move the coins to your paper wallet. You will go to send money. Scan your public key. Then send whatever amount. 
Now lets say you want to verify your coins are in your paper wallet. Go to blockchain.info and look up your paper wallet public key.
Now lets say you want to spend your paper wallet coins. Login to your blockchain account. Go to advanced settings. Import private key. Import directly. Now you can spend your coins. Make sure to send any remaining change to a new paper wallet.
If you have an android phone. I recommend mycelium wallet. Has an easy to use cold storage spending feature.

If done through localbitcoins, its instant. A confirmation code is used to confirm the trade. The code is only known by the buyer, once the trade is complete, the seller should then know what the code is and share it with you, then you know the transaction has completed successfully. The funds will be sitting in your localbitcoins account which you can then move to your cold storage address.

I am a trader. My personal opinion is that our downtrend may be over within a couple months. One great signal I use is 50 day simple moving average and 100 day simple moving average and when the 50 crosses 100 at an upward slope, That's a good sign. Bitcoins current daily moving averages have finally stopped sloping down and are now at a neutral slope on the daily chart. A month of possible sideways before we get that upward slope cross and we may see some nice upward movement. As for now. I think bitcoin may drop between 340-355 range in the near future.

You can use an offline version of bitaddress.org to generate public and private keys. Store them on an offline encrypted device or paper wallet. You can share the public key with friends but whenever you want to finally use your coins, make a blockchain account and import directly the private key and use your coins. Any change that's left goes to a fresh new cold storage public key. Repeat. 
The idea of using a new blockchain wallet for each private key is operational security. You assume each blockchain account is compromised upon using it.

If you have access to your private keys,  go to blockchain.info and make a new account. Then go to advanced settings and import your private key.

Bitcoin may be easier to hide and smuggle out. Cash will be difficult and risky to hide and smuggle. More than likely a conversion to a new currency with a few transitioning to BTC. 
I know 100 USD bills are popular in other countries because its stability and worldwide use. According to a recent study to track where all the 100s are. 80% is unaccounted for. The new hundreds design allowed for statistical analysis if new bills or old bills where circulating in other countries and it was found that new bills where being circulated more than old bills. Which means people like to store their wealth in USD then their Countries currency or trust their banks.

Pretty much all you need is a github version of bitaddress.org to generate your public and private keys. Generate your keys on a computer not connected to the internet. 
Use an encrypted drive or printer to store/print your private/public key.
Send your btc to the generated public key. They are safe there. You can only access them with the private key. 
Now when you want to spend them, one way is to create a blockchain.info account and go to advanced settings, import private key, import directly and now you can send your btc wherever you want.
For good security practice,  only use keys once, once you import the private key somewhere, assume its now compromised and use a new public/private key.

-A github version of a JavaScript qr code generator
-I generate my keys with my offline bitaddress.org html file
-Save a couple deep cold storage public keys to my phone using the qr code generator; keys used to receive funds.
-then encrypt private and public keys with PGP
-Store the PGP file on each encrypted sd card
-Then store away.
When I want to spend.
-I use the offline old laptop to load up a private key using the qr code generator. 
-I use an old smartphone not in use to spend my coins using the android mycelium app cold storage spending feature.
-Send remaining change to a known deep cold storage public key.

I recall once a loooong time ago  moving funds from an exchange to a blockchain account while blockchain was getting heavily ddosed.
The exchange showed they sent out the funds. 
My blockchain address showed they never received anything. Absolutely nothing. Had me freaking out for a while because seeing a unconfirmed transaction is instant but I saw nothing for a few hours.
After about 6 hours I was able to see my funds again. Blockchain servers just hadn't updated fast enough to keep up with the ddos attack.

The returns adjust but are way better than returns on btc loans. My assumption is that people prefer to horde their coins and loan them out and people with cash prefer other investment mediums. The result is a higher supply of btc as opposed to fiat.

I used to work as a factory worker in a machine shop and for our yearly raise, two years in a row. They paid everyone in the machine shop a %2 raise. "To keep up with inflation." Did not matter if you produced more or worked harder than others. My health care coverage kept doubling each year  and the cost of goods/services felt like they increased more than %2 so I was making less than I did the previous year, in retrospect. 
It was a shitty fucked up feeling. Even though the company was doing good and continuing to expand its machine shop.
 I'm now in school full time and work part time. It seems harsh to say inflation has increased by %2 because it doesn't feel like it.

On the recieving end of cold storage:
There is no proof that someone actually has the private key to access the given public key.
The blockchain may have on record that the given public key contains those coins but no proof of someone having the given private key to access those coins exist. So the idea of whatever being a secret is irrelevant. 
Once you use a cold storage address: 
You have to use some kind of medium connected to the internet and since you can't guarantee that the medium you used is 100% secure. You must assume the address is compromised and no longer usable for cold storage. So in a sense, no longer a secret.

Why was mt gox $100 more then all other exchanges. Overall buying pressure was stronger because it was difficult to withdraw fiat so people would convert to btc and try to withdraw their btc.
BTCe is the reverse. More selling pressure because  people are converting BTC to fiat and withdrawing fiat. As mentioned earlier, probably attributed to those doing less legal activities. 
@_date: 2014-09-02 20:24:07
I completely agree. It's not like the exchange at fault was BTC-E which doesn't require any proof of identity. Mtgox had its KYC and AML policies along with other procedures to show accountability and trustworthiness.
Even after mtgox stopped withdrawals. It still allowed clients to deposit btc as if everything was fine.  Only to run off with their clients money. Just because a respected business runs off with the money, you can't claim its the clients fault for being deceived. 
Marks point of failure was trying to cover it up.

Slightly related to your topic. I have noticed Chase has become really strict. I tried depositing cash to a family member and was not allowed to do a  direct deposit. I had to use my debit card and do a cash advance on my debit card at the cost of a fee. I feel its a little too extreme in terms of anti-money laundering policies.
To summatize, don't set up a coinbase account with Chase if they are that strict with cash deposits.

Futures trading on okcoin is basically the same as margin trading on bitfinex. For okcoin you use your btc as your margin and bet using contracts valued at $100 each. You can long and short. If your right, your credited in bitcoin. If your wrong. You lose some bitcoin. They allow upto 10-20x leverage. There is no swap cost like on bitfinex for leveraging which makes them more lucrative for leverage trading. One downside is if bitcoin is falling in value. You will need to at least short enough contracts equivalent to your btc value so your btc fiat value doesn't fall.

Say you have $5 in your account. You place a trade of $50 using okcoin 10x leverage. You are now playing on margin. If the market moves against your trade and your trade shows a loss of about $5. You will be margin called, your trade will be force closed at a loss and you would most likely lose everything. 
In trading, you have to play it like a casino game. You are playing with probabilities and some may be winners and others losers. You cant always be right. Place a trade, define how much your willing to risk(lose), and get out if it doesn't work. You want to trade for random distributions of winners and losers, just like in a casino. Using risk management, your losers will be small in value than your winners, making you an overall winner. The cool thing about trading is that with risk management and good trading indicators, you can give yourself the casino edge.

More to add.
- Accept that not all trades have to be winners.
- The goal is to make a profit when you sum up all your trades. For example, your strategy can have a success rate of 2/5 and you can still be profitable. 
- Find a system that works for you and stick to it.
- Calculate how much your willing to risk (stop loss levels) before you place your trade.
- Accept that loss before you place your trade and you will no longer have anything to fear.

Okcoin.cn has zero trading fees, as long as you don't mind trading in Chinese currency. Okcoin.com has bitcoin futures trading with 10x and 20x margin. You can make a lot of money through futures but very high risk. Okcoin.cn is good for high frequency trading because of the zero fees.

Get a work phone so your personal line won't get bothered, friendly username to attract new comers, use public settings where you can have a nice chat and has cameras in case something happens, practice good judgement and follow your gut feeling. Advertise you will help new comers with their first transaction. Don't sell to anyone who says they received or will use the currency illegally. I think that's what the average btc trader does. After a while, you'll get regulars that buy often.

Okcoin has a pretty well documented api and has a github repository with example api code in php, python, and some other languages. Their github example code is for okcoin.com, but you can easily change it to okcoin.cn and all currency to cny if you want to switch over to okcoin.cn for no fees.
As for writing your own bot. You'll have to get creative and find a strategy you can implement.

If my understanding is correct. Bitcoin will always adjust so that a block is mined at approximately every 10 minutes. So even if hash rate drops or increases. The system will adjust back to that 10 minute average. If hash rate drops, then the remaining miners will gain a small edge by others leaving and bitcoin will just continue to work as if nothing happened.

Generate my keys on an offline computer using bitaddress.org html file I pulled from their github. This is all done on an encrypted drive. If I need a qr code of the public key or private key. I use a JavaScript qr code generator that I pulled from github. I use mycelium(cold storage spending) or blockchain.info(import private key directly) to use the key once, then throw my spare change into a new cold storage address.

My cold storage setup is as follows. I have a computer not connectes to the internet. I have an encrypted usb drive. Within the encrypted usb drive, I have a github version of bitaddress.org to generate my private keys. A github version of a JavaScript qr code generator to create a qr code to scan. And pgp4usb to encrypt my private keys once again in case the usb encryption is compromised. I then use an old android smartphone with mycelium and their cold storage spending feature to use my coins. Or I use blockchain.info and I go to advanced settings,  import private key directly.
Rinse, repeat.

It depends on the competence of the user. Some bitcoiners rely too much on others software and when that user makes a mistake, it's usually irreversible.
Preferably you want access to your private keys in case something happens to the application your using.
As long as you have a decent understanding of how the blockchain works and how to secure your private keys, you should be safe with almost any application that gives you access to your keys.
What helped accelerate my understanding of bitcoin and the blockchain was through reading a tutorial on cold storage. Took about 20 minutes of my time but after I finished reading it, I had gained a deeper understanding of how the blockchain works.

You could create an account with blockchain.info and use their shared coin send feature. This will obfuscate the destination address by using  coinjoin implementation. Low low fee. Like 0.007 btc or something.

I actually agree. I think this goes with the misconception most have that cheaper stocks are better to invest in than expensive stocks. It's all about percentage gains. Price doesn't matter. $1 stock up 10% is the same as a $10 stock up 10% if you own $10 worth of both stock.
