If so, its following the same pattern as the alleged mtgox addresses, splitting away.

not a bad idea.. thanks for the post.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:24:38
Hi ..  so .. just wondering ..  the code doesnt execute since its not within the script tag? .. is that correct? I stupidly clicked on the title of this post and saw the javascript .. ive shiiiit myself .. im running a mac, so i installed little snitch, nothing is connecting online .. no keyloggers .. but.. can't be too careful.  Should I go change all my passwords? 
@_date: 2014-03-04 12:11:41
Fantastic story.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:36:07
I clicked the link, and the page came up in chinese? Should I be concerned??
Anyway, I tried to see more details about the transaction like time and how many confirmations but I can't read chinese! .. ill check my browser setting and try again.
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:15:36
cmon guys .. seriously? 
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:06:43
A lot of web services have chargeback issues, such as web hosting, domain registrations etc, regardless of good service. A physical card swipe is not riddled with chargebacks as online transactions are.

When its in an exchange and you trade it, you run the risk of loss.
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:57:16
post it on youtube please .. that site doesn't work for me :-(
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:11:12
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:21:05
I wouldn't take speculation on Gox as fact.  Also, what else can happen? well .. who knows, but don't forget surprise news from china can impact price tremendously as it has in the past, another exchange going down can crash it, and who knows whats around the corner ..  1 month in bitcoin is a lifetime…. long term I'm a bull, but short term I'm not. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:50:47
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:57:15
Ohh well .. I guess I thought this was news .. or interesting .. and it will just be down voted.
Interesting how these articles keep getting down voted.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:08:57
Yeah :-)
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:05:06
Amazing innit ..  someone trying to rip off those who probably already lost money at mtgox 
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:54:38
Where did you see that this address is MtGox .. very interesting update here. Where will this take us.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:36:03
There are no double spends in bitcoin, and the malleability issues was a mtgox issues apparently, they didn't send the same coin twice, but sent 2 different coins instead.. if its true, then perhaps the worst type of accounting practice I've ever seen.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:21:03
… if you use armoury wallet, you don't need to backup the wallet again, as it uses determanistic addresses, which are required if you spend from that wallet in the future. Im not that technical, but I think with other wallets, you may need to continue doing backups. … but if you only your wallet to receive btc, then you don't need to backup all  the time. please .. anyone, correct me if I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:59:43
You can't win them all, so good luck next time.

I think most redditors wouldn't promote violence or think of creating a bounty for heads, but unfortunately for the crook, the world is not made up of redditors. Heads might roll.

@_date: 2014-03-08 01:43:59
It really makes you wonder what kind of a community we have here doesn't it.
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:00:48
cool :-) .. thanks
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:59:40
Yep .. big news, but I don't know how I feel about that.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:03:42
Sounds like he has some info, but has changed his mind about sharing. . .. but now to say it was a bluff?. Who has been giving you info? Why the change of heart? 
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:46:56
:-)  Sounds about right.
I actually pulled my coins out of the exchanges for now, i have a feeling that another domino is about to fall and the price will come down again soon. Lets see how that prediction goes.
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:11:03
isn't google behind buttercoin?

He now knows things about the inner workings of bitcoin foundation ..  what?   is  there anything this guy doesn't know? who is leaking this? whats the agenda? 
Who does he work for?
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:28:57
interesting theory.
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:21:40
Im going to wait and see the updates on the site .. according to some reddits, call centre can't really say much right now, but are taking down messages for the lawyers.   Perhaps not worth the frustration dealing with a call centre right now that can't assist with info.

Interesting enough, back in the day, I used truecrypt for full disk encryption, but then i realised, it decrypts on boot! so not really that useful for web surfing.   Maybe your solution would work, ill check it out .. thanks.

Hi .. just wondering ... how did you post that JS ?   coz I clicked the title of your post here, went to a .js page, now I'm shitting myself thinking I visited a bad URL installing malware.
Did you cut and paste the JS ? should I be concerned that I visited the title of your post?
@_date: 2014-03-04 07:40:12
Interesting. Thanks
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:37:14
opps .. its been removed.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:26:48
I've been keeping an eye on this latest leak, but how is this "MK officially stole our funds"  ?
It looks like some internal ledgers were leaked which is really bad, but where is the proof of coin theft? 
Am I reading all of this wrong?
@_date: 2014-03-06 12:10:00
Thanks for that, I stand corrected :-)
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:22:54
Id say bitcoin/crypto (biased). 
As you can see by this subreddit, its far from boring.
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:41:01
… maybe not, but it sounds harsh,  much like what it is. Pump and dumps sound good if your doing it, but if your a bag holder, then no, not very nice.

Facebook, Google, Apple, Warren Buffet, Gates and the list goes on ..  Seriously, there are over 400 billionaires in USA alone, and about the same in China, also .. debt can be sorted in terms ..   if they only allow a small fraction of BTC withdrawals every day, the 750K bitcoin can be paid back in terms over years .. and I'm sure gox clients would be happy to receive it over years then never at all.
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:36:21
Any links to show? I haven't seen anything official yet, just the two-bit-idiots latest post.

Im not satoshi nakamoto .. and don't call me Shirley.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:47:23
good luck with that ..  but I think you may have accidentally mentioned different numbers .. such as entire earnings, overhead and savings into mtgox, yet that address still has 150 .. and you have another 500 in savings? Not saying your are scamming, but if reddit users see what I read, they might not want to help .. unless I'm reading it wrong.  Like I said, good luck with that.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:32:48
Can we do another day instead? .. I'm busy that day.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:17:23
who ?  .. never heard of them!
.. but seriously, Sometimes exchanges can be down for a while, so don't worry, fingers crossed.
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:01:28
Thanks for the update.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:37:17
Sadly, sometimes I feel like its already been taken over.
And the idea that anyone can go to a protest, hold up a QR code and receive btc. Who controls that address?  Who controls the spend?
To send money without knowing these basic things is irresponsible.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:38:56
Thanks.. ill have a look .. but I've always seen the block chain.info in english .. first time Ive seen it in chinese .. and I don't see anything different about the URL above which should default to chinese .. strange .. all this malware stuff is starting to spook me perhaps !

no.. we won't.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:18:50
If you love bitcoin, then perhaps anytime is good to buy, but in regards to where the lowest it will be, hard to say.. I mean, imagine if another big exchange goes down? 
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:16:04
I'm sure theres a real big reason .. we just don't know .. but I'm sure he does !

… I know its a joke, and perhaps a poor one, but seriously, I don't think its too far from the truth, apparently 90% of traders lose money as traders.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:15:04
Not possible … as far as I know .. a double spend is not possible to find as it doesn't exist.
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:14:21
This is getting really bad. whats going on here.  I would like to know what the sources are and so should anyone interested in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:35:55
Not to say that its him, no real evidence has been provided, but to start comparing the writing of a man from years ago to now is not conclusive either. It sounds like this individual might be having some health issues which could affect writing skills too.
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:56:19
You know, Ive never heard that one before but I might start using it often now.

@_date: 2014-03-03 16:13:07
Theres certainly no transparency regarding sources ..  i for one am getting tired of this .. sure .. he's been right, but now he's sources are revealing whats going on at the bitcoin foundation? resignations before they happen? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:28:28
Fingers crossed to those betting on this .. I honestly hope theres a chance.  
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:00:19
Only because I'd love to see that, ill up vote your comment :-)
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:59:22
If only this was true !
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:52:16
Am I missing something .. the price isnt moving for now.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:41:05
:-) I hope they are possible ..  otherwise, I will have a hard time trusting any exchange in the future. Anyway, if bitcoin is possible, why not this.
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:45:43
Now this deserves an upvote.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:58:49
I think thats a fair call. At least we can stop worrying about that now.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:29:55
Well ..   if its true, then this thief has some kind of nerve.
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:18:36
yep .. and imagine if another exchange falls.
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:45:36
Yes ..  which side are we talking about now?
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:33:40
No idea, but they seem to get enough support here.
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:19:07

@_date: 2014-03-03 21:45:56
bitcoin is not dead, and mtgox was a trading platform, and in no way controls bitcoin.  Up to a few days ago, it looked like a currency for the people, now it looks like another financial tool for the big boys .. look up second market and buttercoin for more info.  Not to say its not a good investment, infact, it might be one of the best investments for the year, but don't buy into this decentralised currency beyond banking and government influence.. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:40:10
Yes i did ..  :-) .. its a tool company .. but very funny thread !

Thats much better, thanks for clarifying, I'm sure people will be more generous knowing that its a real good cause based on humanity, and not war mongers, Both sides need to eat and have shelter regardless of political agenda. Best of luck.

For merchants, you can obviously not need to worry about chargebacks, as a user you can obviously not need to worry about identity theft..  and I guess it was about not feeding the beasts who run the financial world, but I think thats changed over the last few days. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 11:48:47
Good post
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:52:48


The same can be said about u.
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:07:10
Thats a gox issue, not btc issue.
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:34:10
Scary .. but I think you might be right with your theory but not in calling random reddit users idiots .. a bit harsh there.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:50:11
fair call on that. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:30:01
Yep .. everything you said…  except I have a preference for Armory.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:58:42
Yep .. but form the comments, it seems that its got to do with time between blocks.
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:52:16
What the hell does that mean?

did u read it at least?  .. that was very quick read..
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:50:24
I appreciate your post actually, and perhaps your suggestion is right, its true that goxxed users won't find any love here and what your saying makes sense for those who want to reach out to others who suffered the loss, but I think its important for all bitcoin users to know whats happening with this, as its far from over as other reddits have suggested. You are polite with your suggestions, others here are dicks who discourage discussion that doesn't serve their needs. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 13:17:26
hehe .. sounds normal to me ..  if you bought in November last year, you'd be even more disappointed.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:24:35
So just for my understanding .. what determines the time it takes to create a block then?
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:31:36
Sorry for being sceptical, too many posts to malware sites on reddit. Hopefully the brave can benefit and let others know how it goes. Good luck.
@_date: 2014-03-01 13:15:33
I'm not too sure Gox would be using a HSM .. or any of the big exchanges would ..  I could be wrong, but it sounds to be that its a good idea, but just not practical or cost efficient.
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:54:45
ok .. so he only comes to post leaks… right.
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:34:58

@_date: 2014-03-09 23:53:52
Ok .. sounds like some here say its DPR and others say MtGox .. we need to figure this one out, what a hell of an update.
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:36:57
It's hard to lose money, I lost money too at mtgox, but I don't think begging will work here. Pick up and try again, good luck. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:51:52
I would probably think that the confiscation would be a legal one, not necessarily the fact that mtgox doesn't have duplicates and can't physically access the addresses. Just not allowed to access them.. but just a thought, no evidence anywhere.
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:40:38
I dunno about that. Lets see it go to 1K again before fueling up the rockets that go to the moon.

Hi, sorry for your loss, sounds bad, but fingers crossed it will be ok.
Just wondering though. You mention "been working on bitcoins design since 2007 ..   wasn't bitcoin born in 2009?? 
@_date: 2014-03-04 07:53:41
not a good sign.
@_date: 2014-02-28 10:46:52
Anybody has a youtube video to this?
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:22:22
Maybe I'm reading the api wrong then .. i thought it was updating.
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:56:18
On a mac too, Armoury stopped working, the bitcoinqt app stuffed up, I reinstalled it and it worked again. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:36:23
Id rather see any government organisation stay out of this ..  only since I feel that that would be the worst outcome..  i don't think they would assist  the bitcoin community in any way.

He should use them if he wants to save his skin.
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:11:36
The only confirmation we have here is that he is getting info before everyone else .. and no one is questioning this? 
Transparency for some it seems, as he doesn't reveal sources ..  what the hell is going on ?

Yes, there are malwares everywhere, and the paranoid will survive, but please, I'm not saying you are posting malware, I hope i didn't offend.
.. but on a lighter note, I don't play poker, I don't gamble, I only trade bitcoins! :-) ( insert joke here )
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:55:06
Not being a smart ass here, but i think it needs to be clarified, some one or one group of people will get the BTC.  Who controls the btc address? and what will it be spent on .. how do we know its going to the "good guys" … which people are you talking about?
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:51:05
yeah .. cats are pussies.
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:55:23
No we don't :-)  I didn't know that and I still don't know that.
…. but, its a possibility.  Lets see what other redditors say.
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:21:13
knowing where all these leaks are coming from. Something is happening but no conceited effort to find out it seems.
@_date: 2014-03-03 09:27:02
It's still bitcoin related .. are you a moderator here? 
if not, simply down vote rather then telling users what and where things should be submitted to.
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:38:20
My opinion, other cryptos can become more useful for fast transactions, but bitcoin is the network effect, thats the value people want.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:18:01
Finally ! .. i now have 2 confirmations for each of those transactions .. it has never taken this long for me .. 
So .. why would it take 45 minutes for the last block to be done? is it too many transactions happening right now?
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:20:15
Theres more info he just released .. bitcoin foundation resignations !  something is not right here.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:52:28
keep the faith .. you just never know.
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:26:17


Don't let the wife read this.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:27:49
… no need to explain it, just count your lucky stars!.
but seriously, i think perhaps you installed the same wallet software, which probably uses the same directory path of the old one, therefore, it "found" your old keys.. hence .. you "found" your old coins .. and you didn't install the new wallet on the flash drive at all .. maybe just backed up to it .. let me guess .. same computer, and using multibit?
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:39:25
more free giveaways !
Is this your site or something you stumbled upon?
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:54:16
The tune is changing ..  I wonder who the real idiot is.
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:54:34
so .. google, banks and reddit are going bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:40:33
Evidence non existent.
Nothing to really prove its arthur, and nothing to really prove its not… but something is fishy in denmark.
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:03:20
Apparently the mtgox.com website should have daily updates .. according to the call centre in Tokyo.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:51:15
If there's someone wanting to acquire mtgox and will honour the debts, take it ..  otherwise if you fuk it up for all of us, then you'll be in serious trouble .. not just loss of money.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:50:09
Fist? lol, Good luck with that… but one suggestion perhaps, using google docs to collect info does not inspire trust.
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:57:35
How about the men in black?
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:22:00
Didn't read the article, but the title seems correct. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:18:16
Those were the total amount received over time, the outstanding amount is 0.00011
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:53:33
lol .. and its still there ..  ! .. how long before someone gets it?
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:20:33
Sounds strange to me ..  theres a crap load of malware out there and windows just aint safe ..  if you manage to get your wallet backup running, make sure to move those coins to a new wallet .. maybe even try some cold storage.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:49:57
I think they probably "like" it to get updates..  which is never.
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:03:50
Aren't these coins splitting at a much faster rate then the other allegedly mtgox addresses? 
@_date: 2014-03-04 07:33:13
twobitidiot mentioned the blackhole of btc-e .. and he seems to know whats going on.. or at least is being told what is going on.
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:57:39
I think he means that the sanctuary being the bitcoin dream, and the greed being the possible take over by industry, banks and government… but maybe I'm reading it wrong.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:05:43
Good for you.. time to up vote this post.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:59:46
so .. tell me .. google and reddit are behind this??
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:42:02
Feel free to down vote. It matters to many here.
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:10:15
No, I will wait for the website updates, I didn't call but some redditors have and posted here somewhere that that was what was said.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:36:50
lol ..   timing.
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:01:44
Please keep us updated on this and thanks for posting.
Sorry .. I don't use bitstamp.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:00:23
My spider sense is telling me we will find out more tomorrow.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:44:44
Well put. Fingers crossed for the guy.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:28:25
Thanks for your view and your post here.
@_date: 2014-03-02 00:22:29
actually quite funny.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:39:55
show us something … very interesting
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:53:53
:-) .. you know, I don't think i will click that link .. 8.5 million ..  i guess around 85% of coins in existence .. funny.
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:51:23
Can anyone else confirm this?
@_date: 2014-03-02 00:33:23
unless your aim is for more btc, and not to convert to USD.
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:53:50
 … I think your correct, and it won't be long. .. hints from twobitidiot it seems in his last post.
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:42:56
I think if btc is really adopted by everyone and no other currency is required, then 1btc will be worth 1btc.
 
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:36:24
I think your second theory might be it .. very strange indeed.
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:22:37
decentralised and full of whales it seems.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:05:05
Dont do it ..  have a break, enjoy your family .. its not worth dying for. Money comes and goes.  If you have a family, stay alive for them and for yourself.  
Don't even feel silly if you lost coins at Mtgox .. all the trolls are dicks, they want to make themselves seem smarter than others. You are not a fool. Take a break and think about how your family needs you.  
ALso, its not lost yet, keep faith and talk to friends and family.
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:28:18
No . post it here .. forget what some of the reddits say .. they can vote up or down as they want .. but they can't tell you whats important in bitcoin …   basically .. they don't want this news and they want the mtgox probably to go away coz they didnt lose anything… but its not going away ..  and take their advice with a grain of salt .
Thanks for your post.
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:48:49
If it involves Gox and its good news, the price will skyrocket .. but not holding my breath on that one .. lol
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:21:13
… sad, but true, you should make a pic of the other 10% of BTC traders.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:28:29
I hope you have backed up your keys .. if so, perhaps try reinstalling it, or perhaps even use another wallet.
Good luck with that.
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:55:22
Ok .. thanks for explaining that.
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:47:14
imagine that !
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:45:17
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:38:37
I guess the block chain will be growing fast,  but luckily, wallets such as multibit don't have to download the entire blockchain to work. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:45:14
I would say that btc-e and btcchina would scare the crap out of many bitcoin traders if they were to go down.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:50:49
mmm.. I'm having a similar problem now.. strange indeed.
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:43:48
I use armoury offline/cold wallet and have a watch only wallet on my laptop, so no problems with malware, but .. I also have a multi bit wallet with $20 bucks worth of btc .. I'm guessing that if there some malware, that would quickly disappear.
Now, in terms of software  to check for malware, it would depend if mac or PC .. I think linux is quite safe.  I hear malwarebytes is good for windows, but on mac, I like to use little snitch to see inbound and outbound connections and I also use ClamXav .. but having a sloppy wallet or unencrypted wallet with a small amount of BTC will alert you to the malware if you have any.
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:05:26
Agreed, and I was being a little sarcastic actually, but maybe too subtle, I was trying to make a statement, i wouldn't send any btc there either ..  simply for the fact I don't know where its going and what it will be used for, regardless of how many names of individuals or organisations are dropped.  I've worked in online marketing and I've seen non profit organisations "helping the people" and internal members getting rich. .. 
I'm not about to "accidentally" fund those criminals either.
One nations héros is anothers terrorists.
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:04:54
.. yes .. wtf indeed.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:08:05
… the world is a dark and horrid place with dicks like this in the world.
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:56:34
I dunno why .. but I'm always afraid to visit links giving away money.
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:30:54
Yep .. told via text message on Tuesday!  what?!
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:23:28
really ??
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:05:01
If he manages to come back, I think you may be right.
@_date: 2014-03-06 10:08:59
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:47:03
I get "Error establishing a database connection" ??
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:31:22
What I'm reading from your post is "We need to move on and this isn't helping MY bitcoin investment, I am concerned with MY potential future losses by all this negative MTGOX business"
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:52:44
Thanks for correction. My mistake
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:37:43
:-) .. just what I was thinking.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:41:06
thats what I was thinking.
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:40:17
What grade fireproof briefcase? coz depending on the fire/heat, the contents inside will burn !
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:19:47
Yeah .. it does seem odd, and nothing would surprise me anymore when it comes to bitcoin, but I was just stating that magento is a pain and there are many reasons why it can stop working, I support some large clients running magento and this happens all the time especially if the hosting is crap ..  but yes .. strange that such a large company stuffs up like this .. might be something going on.
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:28:10
Thanks for clearing that up ..  again, sorry for your loss..  and it sounds substantial.
@_date: 2014-03-04 08:23:34
cmon man … need to know already
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:22:13
So if this is true, RogerVer knew on Tuesday about a bankruptcy? .. mmm.. not impressed.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:37:54
Ok, so you are saying that Russia will replace the USD as reserve currency with BTC. It's a long shot.
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:00:45
So a TROO believer thinks it just goes up then?
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:18:29
some here are naive.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:16:18
exactly..   and thanks for the post.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:18:55
I know who people will suggest the devil to be at this moment.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:19:45
Yes, but not from NY .. good luck.
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:28:56
Dammit .. its already posted here :-)
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:02:40
Probably the last thing we need.
@_date: 2014-03-04 08:26:46
.. disappointed if thats it.
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:59:13
final dip? I don't think so. Im sure theres more to come before the climb.
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:42:02
I don't think it can, but you can trade between different cryptos instead.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:17:57
The malleability issue does not cause double spend .. you can not double spend bitcoins. The issue mtgox was having was relying on transaction ids to verify payments, which it should not have done .. they should have verified with the blockchain. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:58:07
Thanks for that.
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:09:37
seriously, second market jumps in to save bitcoin?   mmm.. how good of them to provide such a great service to bitcoiners everywhere! .. time to investigate the "great" people behind second market before judging…   but on a lighter note, the ad is a little bit funny.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:57:32
I think they already understand it :-)
@_date: 2014-03-06 10:08:02
Haven't heard that one before.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:53:59
Maybe use a deterministic wallet such as armory, then you can backup your wallet once and not have to worry about btc change to new addressees etc.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:56:25
I've worked with Magento stores, and many things can cause this. It's a pain of a store to run sometimes, depending on the server.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:42:20
Heres a news article right here.. AP interviews a man for 2 hours and barely come up with a few paragraphs. Another great piece of journalism.
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:47:52
Yes, it does, thanks for sending me those links .. but what a strange post  yeah? I'll keep an eye on this one. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:41:49
Thanks .. your a champ! .. thanks for clearing that up for me .. i was sure it was ok, but I just wanted to hear it from you .. thanks again.
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:00:04
Almost, I think the mark karpeles was funnier :-)
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:33:19
@_date: 2014-03-12 01:32:52
At least they seem to have stopped recently.
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:23:32
opps .. Im assuming its windows? 
If so, check your trash, if its not there, you might need to download a file retrieving software to find deleted files ..  but don't go copying a whole bunch of files to your PC, otherwise you can be overwriting blocks on your hard drive, making it impossible to retrieve those deleted files. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:21:00
Bull..  i think your aussie mate is having a joke on you. or as we say in australia, taking the piss. Only gutter trash say "cunt" in Australia to a mate. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:40:17
Ok, interesting read, worth checking out, but not bitcoin related. But thanks anyway.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:47:24
I think its relevant. Nice pic.
@_date: 2014-02-28 10:19:55
Get your facts sorted.
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:45:04
on second thought, nothing to see here.. its been posted elsewhere on reddit and it stays.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:57:15
The biggest point is not knowing who they are.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:09:05
mmm.. for his sake, I hope your right.
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:43:34
Im surprised… sounds like an issue to be addressed.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:13:56
and their API is still turned on.. mmm. .. who knows.
@_date: 2014-03-06 10:13:48
Sure, add it to the dictionary or vocabulary, it most likely deserves to be there, but to repeat it constantly like a parrot with an obsession!
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:03:20
Thanks :-)
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:26:40
Because I think a lot of redditors don't want this guy to be Satoshi.  Doesn't fit into their ideals perhaps.  I think it would be cool if it was him for that same reason.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:22:47
fingers crossed they are right.
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:52:52
it mentions mtgox and reddit.. so perhaps it belongs here.. otherwise .. get rid of it or whatever.. i thought it an interesting read
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:44:29
Worlds first bitcoin shop? ..  sounds like a play on words.
@_date: 2014-03-06 10:34:04
The public ledger is there and there is no hidden part to it.
.. theres been some analysis of "apparent" mtgox addresses and it seems the coins haven't been moved, which can mean that the keys may have been lost, or confiscated, or stolen etc.
Nobody knows yet, and anything you read here can be FUD.
If the keys have been lost or stolen, then its most likely bye bye coins. … but if its been confiscated "perhaps due to the silk road investigation" then who knows.. but there is no evidence that it does have anything to do with SR, or FBI or whatever, and its most likely FUD too.. but it would make for a very interesting movie.
If it is the FBI, then theres going to be a shitload of pissed off individuals that can't do a thing.
When the FBI confiscated the SR coins, it was certain that nobody was going to say … "Hey .. thats my coins" .. thats for sure :-)
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:55:04
I think a lot of traders are spooked.
@_date: 2014-02-28 10:54:07
Man .. I wish I could find a vid of this.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:02:00
.. but if you just click the ad, it will cost the advertiser heaps of money, and since the click is just a click with no return on investment, it will blow their advertising budget quickly… meaning, bad business for the advertiser.  Also, if you click ads and the resulting page has no goal tracking, it will be seen as click fraud, making it a high risk advertising category ..  i know coz i worked in online advertising ..  good suggestion, but not the way it works.
@_date: 2014-03-02 00:30:26
Are you doing this solely to secure your bitcoin wallets?
@_date: 2014-03-06 10:14:42
Valid points. Thanks for the post.
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:21:07
maybe this is something you should develop.. sounds like a good idea ..  having something specifically for bitcoin malware would be great, or if not better then other browser plugin, at least a good marketing angle.
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:07:51
Thanks, interesting post.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:22:39
Delete and forget it.
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:34:15
I still the the website, not getting this issue.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:10:46
What tool are you using? .. is that on your phone?
