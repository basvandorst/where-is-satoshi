Theres no guarantee? When I sold at $4400 and bought back at $4100 all within 4hrs? You realize I said all this after having already made the action? You're right it wasn't guaranteed, it was already a reality.

I sold at $4400 and bought at $4100 where it was at when I posted...so...
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:59:14
Lions and tigers and bears- oh my!

?? No I sold at $4400 yesterday evening and bought at $4100 just now. $300 is a very clear drop, i just made $300 on every BTC i owned and am hodling just like everyone else again. You all are watching it dip, but Im making $$ on that plus buying and hodling after and when it's $4500 again youll be back to even and I'll have made profit in that small window.
I just dont get why everyone is opposed to that tactic, and wanted insight. But instead I realied that the hodlers are not really hodling so much as they are afraid to sell and buy back

Pathetic article honestly. How disgustingly uninformed.
They clearly Googled "Why Bitcoin is Risky" and then took whatever they could find...which was once again, the Tulip story.
If you're going to compare the new "internet" of money, to some Tulip incident, then you're insane.
Saying Cyrptos aren't going to be the future is like being in 1980's saying computers won't change the world...And look where I am and what I'm doing as I TYPE that...

Big difference between "panic-sell" and smart-selling.
If you didnt sell at $4300-4400 when it was obviously going back under $4000 this weekend then you are just pissing $$ away.
Just because you sell doesn't mean you can't buy back more right after the large and obvious looming drops.
Panic-sell would be to sell and be fearful of buying back at a lower price. Smart selling is doing just that but smartly buying back more after you cashed in.
HODL is the long term tactic, but selling short in somehing so volatile and buying back often is far more lucrative and easy to do too because anytime BTC moves +-300 in a day you can tell which way the chart is about to shoot.

IRS not snooping anything under $20,000 transactions. And every profit is taxed. The tax will be exactly the same if you make $10000 holding as it would if you both sold and hodled. You make $10k you pay taxes on it, period, doesnt matter how you made it and how many sells you did, whether it was 20 or just 1 after a long term hold.
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:24:26
Okay sounds good. Im going to get hurt by what? Selling at the wrong time, making my money, and then missing out on a huge boost to the market thus missing out on even bigger gains?
Will I have really lost? After having bought most all my coin at $1850?? 
Or is that just gamblers mentality thinking I lost because I didnt win as much as I could?
At which point- yah that sucks- but am I HURT by that? Did I LOSE money? No. 
So many gambler mentalities in this sub man.
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:03:52
I never said i knew the future. I posted after it already dropped and asked why other people didnt do the same action
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:11:50
Huh?? When the market is dumping $100's at a time and you sell during it and then buy back at the end of the day, you win. Thats all i ever said.
I sold at $4400 after it reached it the 2nd time and then began dumping immediately after. Not that had to just watch the chart orders and see it all plummeting- then sell- then buy back at end of day at lower price. When it does happen, its very obvious its happening. Kind of like just this evening... it was clearly going under $3900 so if you sold at $3950, you could buy at $3850 this moment and make $100 on everything - anyway, the $4400 shift was far more prominent and more obvious, but if youre just sitting watching the market and you see the flash dump begin you arent going to be hurt, worst case it evens out quicker than you thought (in an hr? 3hrs?) and you rebuy at the same price as its going back up. 
Literallly the only obstacle is a big enough bankroll to work with since every transaction gets tied up in processing.
Of course there are taxes and what not but made money is made money, and lets not act like more than 50% of btc holders that sell on occassion actually pay or know how to file the taxes on the relative-to-them significant amount they made but relative to the grand scheme was just chump change
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:06:01
How could I have guessed wrong? I already sold at $4400 yesterday and bought the same amount of coin back at $4100 each today.
Now I'm holding again. Right back at it, but I made money while it was clearly available. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:09:52
Wrong? Sold at $4400. Bought again at $4100 today. I dont think you're getting it, I just mean whats the matter with seeing that BtC is tanking today and selling to start the day and buying at its lowest point.
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:06:14
How would you call it fucked?
In the case I was "fucked" I would have made a lot of money from selling and just not made *as much* money as if I held longer. Saying Id be fucked because I missed out on the larger gains is gamblers mentality- thinking that winning a large amount isn't great if a larger amount could have been won by gambling more. Get out of bitcoin if you are using it to gamble-vest.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:40:20
This is exactly what I was thinking. The increase in price about to happen from this essential thwarting of an attack by a rotten fork is going to probably shoot the price high enough that anyone holding will make just as much or more than had they gotten 2x coins and sold them immediately.
I smell $8k being busted by the weekend. Possibly a $9-10k moonrise by Monday when the bullrun catches on over the weekend.
To the moon people! To the mooonnn!
Edit: we we're wrong! what's new though guys! hodl and enjoy :) this fun really never ends.

It's funny how in a well thought-out post it gets tons of traction and upvotes, but when it's dumbed down into a comment in reply to someone else's stupidity there's nothing but downvotes to be found. 
Same information. Two different ways of it being told to people. But apparently it's the podium being spoken from that counts the most?
That tells me right there that half the people who read this are nodding their head but are the same people that will get emotional and reckless when it comes down to it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:03:40
what is this even? it's talking about bitcoin like they are stuck in last week....
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:46:45
It's  mainly.
That's based on a REAL cognitive bias, so I don't doubt that in comes into play with this type of stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:47:02
Okay this is officially my favorite btc meme. It makes the worst moments seem so trivial lol.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:10:12
And to be honest, I'm REALLY happy to see someone have identified it as a reason for how volatile this market is.
Once you're fully aware of all the little tricks your mind likes to play on you, you kind of look at the world like: "oh man, I know this, but look at all these people who are unaware and just fall prey to their own mental biases so often..."
So when OTHER people show they are aware, I get really giddy because I feel like very very slowly the world is waking up and eventually the significance of these biases won't be quite as significant as they are now. 
Spread the word, let's better our minds one at a time until we truly are an efficient and level-headed society!

Let me take it from here.
No spending = lower GDP.
Lower GDP means interest rates rise.
Interest rates up means property values inflate.
Property inflation = more people rent.
More rentors = less long term debts.
Less long term debts = more disposable income now.
More disposable income now = more spending now.
Question is...does the decrease in spending level out with the paradoxical increase in spending that it creates?
*Please consider this /s*

"Higher interest rates can negatively impact home sales, but prices move according to the relative supply and demand and have generally increased in declining sales markets..."
- Walter Molony (Economic Issues Media Manager at National Association of Realtors)
This pretty much describes what I mean for the most part. Hope that helps.
Please remember though I was just making a fun economic-type slippery slope of how the market might move if "no one is spending". Lol. But yes, in theory reduced spending could actually produce a *relative* increase in spending at the same time, but I would imagine the reduced spending in general would outweigh that increase. It would almost create a more gradual decline in consumerism than a fast crash because it semi-counterbalances itself.

I was in here saying buy buy buy between 2000-2250. Still standing by that notion.
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:58:24
Dude you aren't a market genius. Maybe take a step back and accept that. You can't always be right, so just assuming everyone else is wrong is like gambling - you THINK you know what's going to happen, but you are just speculating.
If you can show me that you've been buying and selling since the start and have this whole thing figured out and yada yada then sure MAYBE. But honestly, I'm doubting you've got much experience OUTSIDE of BTC. What else is in your portfolio? What makes you such a savvy investor? Why are you the all knowing, benevolent BTC master? I'm just not seeing it.
I'm being *wholly* objective here and saying that they use the term SPECULATION, because it holds that defintion when all is said and done. It's SPECULATION. There's nothing wrong with doing research and believing something will happen outside of what is speculated to happen.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:16:12
Can I get some credit yet??? ;)
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:37:03
Price speculation is SPECULATION. Period. It will never be guaranteed so acting like what is being speculated is the end all be all is the  reason I know you'll never be a good investor. Enjoy your day mate.
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:55:20
I'm not going to post a book but like I said elsewhere, buy buy buy between 2000-2250. There is nothing wrong with buying at the high end of that. If you wish to wait for support to come in at 2000 and see it drop to that then okay, but I'm still shouting BUY!
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:05:44
To each their own! Today is the day to buy my friend. Take it or leave it.
@_date: 2017-07-27 04:25:03
Soooo, use BreadWallet?
Also why are so many idiots out there saying 1BTC will turn into 1BTC + 1BCC and the price of BTC will chop in half and your own 2 coins instead of 1 but the overall value will stay the same. That just CANNOT be true.....
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:20:30
Everything has happened everytime always this way? Or is it really jsut that these conditions and predictions are the general outcome in these situations? If it was 100% guaranteed, maybe I would sit on it, but it's not, and I've done my own research, so I'll be buying - sorry?
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:21:22
I'm not being optimistic, I'm being realistic. Today is the day to buy. You can buy at $2000 if it drops and gets support there, but anything under 2250 is buy buy buy and I'll stand by that.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:16:48
Do they?
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:35:00
Okay, because you own $10000's in BTC and have been a big player in the market from the start? Or you're just speculating like every other person in this sub, I'll delete post. You guys will be disappointed if you don't buy in the next week.
