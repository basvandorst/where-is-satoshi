yeah...I did suspect one reason they take so long to pay out could be some kind of trading period for them to make a profit on larger amounts. I'm not sure if this is common but its what the banks do with our savings...difference with bitcoin is they have to do it after the sale. I'd be interested to see proof of sales from IGOT and blockchain records. Probably will never happen.

Really??! Please give more details!

I've still had no reply from IGOT after opening serveral support tickets and sending numerous emails to the different addresses. Avoid IGOT...I would not advise using them for any services due to the abusive nature of their service. There is really no excuse for this.

I heard another guy received a confirmation email. waiting to hear if the money arrived. Mine is still pending with no reply from igot for a month to support tickets. Hows that court case going?

The proof of payment does not include a date. Also I made the initial withdrawal from my IGOT account on the 22/04/15 at 00:43 hours which is shown on my IGOT transactions on my account. I also pointed out to them that I have made a wire transfer between Westpac and OCBC banks which are the same respective banks IGOT is using in the respective countries and it took 1-2 days, for me I was surprised how fast it went through.

ACORN / SA fed police said something like: they are aware of IGOTs issues and are satisfied that they have not currently committed an offence though if I wish to pursue further to contact ASIC. IGOT have recently had a new message on the site saying they have paid out 40% of withdrawals...has anyone seen that? Would love to hear if anyone has had their withdrawal processed. Cheers

yes I wish I had been more diligent and noticed it then. I read your recent post. Please let me know if you have any luck receiving your payment. I had an update message and my 4 support tickets closed in the last 2 weeks promising a pay outs from the 9th of jan up until the 12th feb. They said all will be honoured. Lets see if they keep their word.

still nothing from these guys. Recently some messages to say they will cover it and the withdrawal is going through. No idea what to expect. When mentioning complaints commissions in Australia they brought up the name Beaumont Ventures Ltd. in HK in reference to the terms and conditions. Its just a virtual office for the same company as far as I'm concerned that being 13th Pty (

they owe dozens of people large sums of money for months now. Stay well clear

I beg to differ, search reddit or eve their facebook for the angry hordes.

I contacted all the agencies I could in Australia and never had any progress. One did reply to me SA.GOV.AU and tell me of an ongoing investigation but then the email address started to bounce back. I'm guessing they just gave up. I'm still waiting since nov 2015 for about 8k.

yup its true...bitlio are exactly the same pricks as igot. They try to woo us with their new scheme though just sending a few emails to support who were quite responsive but still passive aggressive AF.
Use em at your peril!! 
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:22:07
oh and they still owe me a mint!
