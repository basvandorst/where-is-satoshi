Did you that bitcoin fluctuates in value? Circle is best if you don't know anything about bitcoin... because you will just see USD or whatever your local currency is, in your account and arent subject to bitcoins price volitility, but when you send to your supplier, they receive the bitcoin currency, as they requested.... They are insured, just like PayPal, etc.. you don't have to worry about losing your money, unless you are doing illegal or questionable stuff with it. 
Now, if you want to dive down the bitcoin rabbit hole, I recommend reading the whitepaper and learning more. It is VERY interesting and you might find that you want to hold some bitcoin currency and maybe even secure some, yourself.

I should also mention that many people like bitcoin because it doesn't require a banking type entity like paypal, you can actually hold them, yourself, like digital cash.. so many people in this thread and, like the reviews you read don't like, or even hate services like circle and coinbase... but, they are insured and probably more secure for someone like yourself.

Nice solution.. I am curious to learn more.. this is an important issue that needs to be solved.

I think one of the most interesting aspects of decentralized identity is decentralized credit rating and reputation.. ideally, I would want to include far more info than my address, like my interests, to some people , but others, less.. powerful to own your own data and if it's shared with people that we choose, it can be far more useful than targeted advertisement. I imagine having access to most of my friend's data and using it to carpool, share food and learn new skills. Then 'decent' credit ratings can enable people to issue interest free money themselves instead of loaning it from a predatorial bank

I'm not an atheist, but not into religion, either.. I have a personal relationship to the spirit that flows through all things.

You can use ripple to create a financial trust network by issuing p2p credit lines to your community members.. Money is then created by digging into credit lines.. the IOU's that are created can then be traded with others.. you can learn more about this concept on wiki  ..

There is a new social network being developed utilizing ripple.com's protocol at  but it is has not launched, yet...

Bitcoin is a useful tool for avoiding capital controls.. it is a non-government decentralized store of value... something like venmo, might be more useful for people who live in the US, right now.. bitcoin is more of a hedge against their local currency.. many countries and people are selling off their USD because of federal reserve administrative fraud... I see USD as a usury based ponzi scam and I think it's value is continuously propped up... because of this view, I diversify my wealth with bitcoins and metals.. so far, its worked out very well for me.
As far as 'general adoption', when we see hyper inflation with the dollar, there will be rapid adoption.. otherwise, it will slowly gain pace, maybe more so, in places like Argentina.

Got my hands on some and they are stored all over the place...so upset that the place I thought they were 'safest' and encrypted are the ones that got stolen... so it goes... but no more suggesting bitcoin to my friends, I doubt any would go for it after this story, honestly...

It is similar to the monetary system the world uses, only, anyone with good reputation can issue money instead of a select few... oh, here a good video..

I find the people most interested in bitcoin as a currency are the ones who dislike or want to hedge against fiat money and want to see that system end.
There are new, unique things that you can only do with bitcoin and I think that will drive adoption more as it grows. Ie. purse.io, rebit.ph, proof of existence, bitrated and smart contracts.. people drawn to the tech solely for these things might also prefer to hold 'bitUSD' or something like this.
@_date: 2017-02-24 17:34:54
WHAT!!!?!?! AGAIN!?!?!?!!!! OH SHA1T!! SELL!!! SELL!! SELL!!!
@_date: 2015-05-27 21:16:58
Its definitely for use in both.. I hold it as long as I can and I prefer to credit cards for all purchases if possible so I spend it quick on egifter, purse.io, proofofexistence.com and rebit.ph , and I buy more when I'm able. I prefer to keep money in btc than dollar for political/hedging reasons.. I also get paid in btc for WordPress work when possible.
 i find that my friends who are interested in its long term value don't feel comfortable with personal digital security involved, yet. I tend to caution people as I don't think it is really ready for non-techie people yet and even techie people (myself included, lost btc to malware/social engineering).. 
My mother-in-law bought some and keeps it in a coinbase vault which is a good option for some. Other people, including me, are most enthusiastic about not needing a bank to use it but security practices need to improve for these people to hop in.
Its awesome tech and people are VERY interested .. but there is a big difference between interest and investing.
I've been involved for a long time and it took me a couple years before putting money into it. (Mostly because of distrust for the exchanges at the time).. I ended up loosing my first 2 btc (@ $8) then gave up on it (yarg), in favor of mutual credit, for another year. At this point, I still find that most people have still never heard of it or don't understand it if they have.
Happy to share my experience.. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:35:34
I have introduced bitcoin to many friends.. i am in the US.. my friends are mostly on the side of non-conformist 'hippy' and many don't like the idea of scarce money like gold and that tends to be a turn off, in preference of direct trade or personal credit.. my friends also have a tendency to be anti-tech because of surveillance issues.. they often assume that this is another PayPal (turn off) until they learn more.
Once I help them understand, they do like the idea of a system that will make banks and centralized trust obsolete.. this is my main motivation. 
My friends like that it is not a company but a dac and they don't have to 'sign up', they dig the non-traceable privacy of their accounts and are encouraged by the idea that it might go up in value.. discounts at purse.io are really motivating, too.. 
these days, there are some unique use cases that require bitcoin. I have a friend that is stoked to be paid in bitcoin because he buys ganja seeds from an online store that ONLY accepts btc as payment..
 I have been involved with alternative currencies for many years and am excited to see my friends and family start to gain more interest. I don't have many friends who are interested in holding bitcoin as a savings but they are interested. Most use it right away on purse or to buy ganja seeds, though.. They do think it is interesting but don't have extra money to invest.

Why a scarce currency instead of locally produced? Local currency is far more accessible and easier to understand. Bitcoin is good for international.. mutual credit for local. They could be using colored coins or decentralized mutual credit like villages.cc/classic ripple

Honestly, I'm not Average Joe, but I do run a Mac and I have tried to compile software before but have never had success on my mac but it is very easy in my remote Linux server space. I am normally very cautious about what I install but this slipped from reading all the positive comments and tips on the thread.. looking into it, the comments might be fake, too..
I know, I should have bought an offline storage device, but honestly, a netbook still seems kinda crazy... I put them in coinbase with 2fa and stopped using my computer for now. I am thinking to scratch my system and go Linux (thinking Ubuntu?) on my home computer with a clean install or maybe a dual boot and make different usernames instead of being admin all the time..
I will get a trezr or something like this for my remaining bits when they are available.

Great points.. I am aware of these characteristics of ripple.. the question of which platforms will thrive doesn't depend on decentralization, it depends on liquidity. Personally, I love decentralized systems and love bitcoin.. most of the world could care less, they just want cheap, secure and fast. I hope the block stream team acts fast to get their ripple killer in order and work just as hard to get banks on board.
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:44:06
If ripple is adopted by banks, XRP will become more liquid than BTC, fast.. ripple has a first mover advantage and most people haven't even heard of side chains (or ripple, I know).. personally, I am excited about side chains and prefer to use btc as the decentralized 'central bank' but, I already use ripple more than btc because of its advantages... People, like myself, don't like waiting for new tech to build on top of, when it already exists in one form or another. Ultimately, we will have to wait and see what happens.. coming from Armstrong, Ripple is coinbase's biggest threat..

@_date: 2013-04-19 02:32:52
 and  created by Ryan Fuggar, are both active trading networks utilizing the ripple technology.. In ripple, you must create a trust network, you can then exchange mutual credit amongst your extended network of trusted peers. It is very useful. Personally, I have been active on villages.cc for about 2 years. This network is for exchanging time 'hours' only, it is friendly and relatively easy to use with my community.
 OpenCoin has developed a decentralized version of ripple and uses XRP(ripples) to help validate accounts and prevent spammers.. they are the only universally trusted credit within the system and they are issued by OpenCoin.
They will be having a massive giveaway soon (so, I hear) and will be selling ripples in the future. It 'costs' 300XRP to use the system. 
Ripple is very useful to use with your community of trusted peers. XRP are the 'hard currency' of the distributed ripple system.
If you want some XRP to explore the system, I can give you some to get started.

I agree that we ned to go beyond the use of scarce currencies like fiat, gold and bitcoin, although they all have their place ...
I think Time credits (community trusted IOU's) via a trust network or ripple type system seem to be an abundant and valid measurement of value.
Scarcity and lack consciousness is a byproduct of the currency we use. It is not an inherit aspect of life. This planet supports life and has for millions of years. 
Bitcoin, certainly does not solve this issue.. As communities understand Social Credit systems, we will be able to work and contribute to society however we choose (as long as it is viewed as valuable by community, not just banks)
Bitcoin is valuable because it is scarse and useful. Time is intrinsically valuable. We can be exchanging pure value instead of scarce commodities.

There are other systems of exchange that could replace or be complimentary to bitcoin, like mutual credit systems,  ripplepay/villages.cc are good examples of a working economy style without 'hard scarce gold style money'..ripple.com is a new distributed model/attempt.
 I think a combination mutual credit and hard currency (bitcoin) works great in combination.. mutual credit works within a trust network, but if you aren't trusted and don't want to trust anyone, you need bitcoin.
Reputation based economy seems the way of the future, bitcoin is useful, too..
Reputation/ mutual credit systems  and other currencies (goldCoin, usdCoin, etc) can be made on top of bitcoin, too.. examples, search for 'colored coins' or 'mastercoin' .. unlike ripple.com, this will have the support of the already established money protocol (bitcoin) community
 I ultimately think humanity will evolve beyond commodity exchange as we reach singularity... btc/mutual credit work for now.

You can make payments using whatever currency you have to any bitcoin address.. it finds a pathway to exchange your currency to the one requested by the merchant. If the merchant posts a ripple receiving address, they can receive ripple payment in any currency.. unfortunately, you have to keep your currency with a community trusted intermitiary (like a bank.. could be PayPal, Dwolla, wells Fargo, etc..) ripple in in beta but it is always becoming more and more functional.. with the mutual credit aspects, money simply becomes a measure of value and you can even issue time credits that can be traded in an exchange.. so I could, with a nice trust network, pay someone in yen or feather coins or whatever with hours.

You can transfer any kind of property rights, contracts or issued currency, including self issued currency (like personal gift certificates) on bitcoins protocol. There are also services like bitmessage and 'proof of existance' This money protocol in part of html5 .. 
The bitcoin currency, itself is best as a store of value. Most people want to save them, not spend them. Most people are is stoked to get as much as possible.
 I spend them as much as possible now, as a means to encourage growth in my investment. The people who accept them, SAVE them. I replenish what I spend, immediately. This is what will drive adoption. 
I think people will prefer exchanging more abundant currencies in everyday life, but might use bitcoin to buy a house or a car.

A bitcoin 'pay wall' plugin for WordPress w/o any 3rd party requirments would be great... 
another idea I've been thinking about alot is a global social marketplace where people can develop trust and friendships..  trusted friendships and no remittenance fees.. A main focus would be suggested sliding scale prices based on price in country of origin (like thailand or india) compared to price in Europe or US.. I think this would balance global economics ... and help people to consume more consciously.
Another would be a Blockchain based twitter that people can search by hash tag or username. Maybe pay more for featured posts, etc... maybe pay a small amount to post.
Let me know what u think... the pay wall is probably the most useful, right now, avoid fees from sites like yumcoin.. lots of people would definitely use it right away.

Trust is the foundation of ripple. You can't really use any of it's primary features unless you trust others... I've been using it for a few years and it really empowers more active community connection.

Thanks for the link. Sounds like a fun movie. 


Exactly, just a medium of exchange. it's not ideal to back it by an ever greater scarce commodity. It seems a combination of IOU(debt) and hard currencies(silver or BTC) have always been used and will most likely continue to be.
For me, I'd prefer to use hard currency if necessary or with people not in the trust network but much prefer to use more abundant (not indefinitely of course) time credit IOU's.
In a place where there is no  or minimal access to gold, bitcoin, or fiat.. The ability to do 'indirect trading' within a trust network would be very valuable.

It was posted a few days ago.. Send x amount to the 'exodus address' this is used to fund the new mastercoin protocol which is similar to colored coins and is a layer on top of btc. When complete, I will have 100*x mastercoins that I can access with my sending address key... which is my mobile wallet.. probably no big deal, but might need a plan of action to remedy
I thought this was a genius way to take anonymous investers... I guess it was flawed :-(  I'll send a PM to the master coin crew

I'm looking forward to more consumer protective measures, for sure... I'm a bitcoin holder and supporter..

Have you heard of  yet? Ripple is a distributed trust network for exchanging digital IOU's from trusted sources, much like our the main stream money system, only, we are in charge.
@_date: 2013-09-08 22:59:08
Can you go more in depth or do you have a link to an article?
@_date: 2013-08-16 23:26:58
Thanks for much for the discussion and letting us know how the project is going! 
I am most excited about the personal empowerment that can happen when people are empowered and able to create their own currencies backed by their energy. Have you thought much about mutual credit systems like LETs, ripple pay, or time banks and how we might be able to use colorcoin to be a secure modality for people wanting to do community based trading and 'time banking'.. 
I guess there is a need for color coin exchanges, too.. 
Trade 2 HR1coin for 1 HR2coins.. trade 1 HR2 for .25 btc. Etc...
@_date: 2013-07-28 05:38:58
I think private salt coins will become a popular trend and a network for exchanging currencies interchangably will democratize money

Yip! Keep up the good works... sent ya little something :-)
@_date: 2013-04-29 19:01:48
I haven't used it but "Are PayPal" could be a good place to start.
I believe, it requires users to be logged in.. seems most appropriate..
Another model could be "one time viewing" and just give the user a cookie.. the porn sites would probably do well with that version..
Another route would be to simply encourage "Fraxion" or "tinypass" to accept BTC as payment option... Personally, I'd prefer not to use 3rd parties and to have this type of thing on my own server.. (If it is secure....)
@_date: 2013-07-22 17:58:49
I've had nothing but trouble with coin base this last week.. 12+ hour transaction times.. over it..
@_date: 2013-08-04 20:09:48
yes, I guess people will pay for peace of mind.. and they already trust paypal.. I still use it, cause my friends &amp; clients don't want to wait a few days for a coinbase verification and most of the internet uses it, exclusively... I would think that btc would have way smaller fees than USD...  Bitcoin addresses are way more universal, though... I like how you can pay in from any currency to a BTC address via ripple.. curious about how they will use it.. wonder if OP will post proof.. whatever.. thanks for cultivating the good discussion..

There seems a tendency for bitcoin to become more and more centralized as mining hardware needs to get faster.. litecoin is already more decentralized than bitcoin.. bitcoin's primary value is its decentralization... so... yea..there is value in litecoin

Eek.. I've been waiting about 10 hours for a transaction to go through... eek.. i don't know what to do because it was at POS in person and I couldn't do the exchange at all.. hoping my transaction is refunded in 24 hours like it says on their website... what do I do in this situation?? A little freaked out.. not relying on coinbase anymore.. that's for sure..
@_date: 2013-05-26 00:32:10
The future may reside in kick starter type campaigns.. "If we get x amount, then we will do y, if we don't get that, you get your money back" 
the bitcoin protocol is already designed to support this type of transaction. 
If people's roads aren't functional, people will campaign to fix them. 
Public services are so vital but practitioners would need to create some pretty good proposals to get funded.. 
Social pressure would probably motivate people more, too..
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:30:31
Thanks for the response, although this seems like a very unique and brilliant business plan, and we'll probably see more like it, in the future, I'm sure this has been a big question from people, especially, the anarchistic bitcoin community.. 
I guess my question is more like: What if opencoin were forced to stop the issuing of XRP, altogether... maybe, after ripple was already popular.. if you're in, you're in? Are the XRP currently distributed amongst accounts? Or all in one OpenCoin account?
I guess someone would create a clone of the system if none else could join, right? Restart... idunno?
Personally, I've been using villages and ripplepay for a few years and already have XRP, I'm in whether this is on a single server or distributed... ripple has been VERY useful for me but, I'm still examining the new XRP thing.. any response is helpful, thanks..

I think colored coin sounds like it can do all that ripple can do, but uses the already established bitcoin money 'protocol' not some new technique with a new standard 'XRP'.. It will have the full support of the bitcoin community instead of being called a scam and competitor.. Ripple tech is so powerful.. it's gonna change the whole game, but colored coin and/or mastercoin is a much better way to implement it than ripple.com

I agree, I think the new currency will be "Self issued bonds" or IOU's that are trusted by your whole community via a trust network. Hoard bitcoins like a savings account, eventually, buy a house or car, for everyday exchange , trade abundant time credits..

I agree, bitcoin is a great store of value and is the reason it'll be adopted. For everyday exchanges, i prefer emotionally tied trust network backed IOU's.. time is an abundant resource and will always hold the highest value.

I love  and  which are the same but pre-decentralized version, created by Ryan Fugger (not mentioned??).
I have been using these systems, mostly villages for over 2 years. It is awesome to be able to work and do exchange with people that choose to have less USD. I accept self-backed 'hours'.
I have been using ripple.com, but, thus far, villages is more useful to me.

Thanks for the response! Love it!! I am excited about this type of economic system because the the 'mutual credit' potential.. I love the idea that everyone can be a 'bank' and issue credit backed by our life energy.. it seems that would be possible with this.. I know ripple hasn't gotten the 'pathway circles' working and might not ever.. this seems like it would work fine.. curious.. u said, the govs would go after the trusted parties, doesn't color coin need trusted issuers to work? Are there ways to create automatic pathways of trust using color coin?

@_date: 2013-09-27 18:11:06
XRP are like stamps you must use to make trust agreements and to make exchanges.. you need to maintain a minimum amount to use the network and maintain trust connections. XRP can also be used as a currency when there are no pathways of trust.
