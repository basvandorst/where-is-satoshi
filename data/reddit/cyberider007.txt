You obviously don't understand how Ethereum works. If it relied on top level domain names controlled by governments that would be centralized. You are visiting a website for Augur because it is not blocked. If it were blocked you would only be able to interact with Augur it thru an Ethereum client that can never be blocked just like anything else on Ethereum.

You are right, Augur fate is sealed in having success!
Ethereum is whatever the consensus wants. It nice to know if $100M were stolen from Augur there might be a consensus to get the stolen money back.
BTW currently I'm using Fairlay.com

You can't. Thus Augur that won't be ready for a while yet. So place your bets according to your odds of that risk. I'm into Fairlay pretty good but I've reached my limit of risk.

I have 36BTC in Fairlay right now...
I'm your user that started the market "Hillary Clinton will be indicted in 2016".
KILLary for Prison 2016!

lol, I just read that article. A good bunch of chuckles to start my day. All of the candidates are fucked, but who is the most fucked? KILLary. This thread is about the best place to bet on the fuckers and I'm using Fairlay.com. Uses bitcoin. But they better not get Goxed or Bitfinexed. BTW I also started a market on Fairlay that KILLary will be indicted in 2016.

Why? If I'm lying or telling the truth it probably won't change a thing for you.

Agreed. The best indicator for the number of "real nodes" is  but unfortunately they are not tracking Super UASF...

I was thinking of "Super UASF" as in:

I like thinking and can't believe after 8 hrs I'm the fist person to complement you on it.
You conclude to trade/follow the wales. But the problem is just that, you are following them, the market moves have already happened. How does one know when to make a move based on what they think whales are doing. How do you even know its a whale(s) at work and not something else? How do you know what the whales are going to do next? etc. Even looking back at sudden market swings (other than the recent DAO attack on Ethereum) it hard to say what caused the sudden market swing.
BTW in your analogy of the market foodchain this was a bit confusing with "gentle" and "hunt".
