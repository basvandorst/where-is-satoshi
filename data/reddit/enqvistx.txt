It's often quoted as HOLD ON FOR DEAR LIFE, but that's wrong. This right here is the real origin.

Hmm. We have a very different prognosis on what will happen when Tether collapses. 
You're saying people who have their coins on Bitfinex might lose them because Bitfinex might have to shut down. 
I am saying that the price of BTC and all altcoins will plummet and it won't matter where you keep your coins. It appears that the price of BTC was artificially pumped to insane levels by issuing phantasy money (2.5 billion "USD" since April 2017 mind you) and I have a feeling it will never recover back to these levels after shtf. As such I am tempted to pull out half of my coins. Greed is holding me back so far. What if it doesn't plummet? It will hurt more to miss out than losing my investment.

Wait. How does keeping my coins on Binance protect me from any of this? Binance price is calculated against USDT. When BTC Bitfinex price plunges it will pull the BTC overall price down in an instant. Regardless of which exchange your coins are on. All altcoins will collapse as well. 
I've been following the whole Tether situation for a few weeks and am starting to get worried enough to pull half of my crypto into Fiat. It's just greed that prevents me from doing this so far.

From "p2p electronic cash system" to "store of value" in 11 years.

Sorry, yes.

Hoarding Bitcoin now might as well turn out as hoarding "laptops" from 1977 or radios from 1921 or lightbulbs from 1880.
If you believe Apple makes good products you invest in Apple and not in thousands of iPhones, do you?

*affected x2, *affect
Please learn the difference between effect and affect. This hurts my brain :)

Sometimes I wonder who's money I took. Got in at 14k but picked altcoins over Bitcoin. Went to 6x. Sold everything at 2x two days ago. Realized that all my profit is someone else's loss. Feels good but feels bad. Hope to get in again when it reached the bottom.

Me too :) Put everything in my EUR wallet on GDAX. Felt good to see my Delta App Balance lower than my EUR wallet. Right call.

Most of which (the modern ones) are PoS. So, probably, yes.

I invested thousands. And now I have thousands x2 (sold when BTC fell below 9). I could have had thousands x6 if I sold a few weeks ago but I'm still very happy with the results.
Going to re-buy all my coins that I sold when it hits rock bottom at a huge discount AND make a profit.

Maybe this isn't the bottom of the dip and they're simply not being stupid?
