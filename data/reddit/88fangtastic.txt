Nah. Another tease. Mid sept will be the last time all crypto is on sale. Give it a week.

@_date: 2019-07-02 17:54:17
Volatile. 24hr mood swings. Who knows. Last night it fought at 9730 to 9780 for hours.
@_date: 2019-07-21 19:37:04
Btc seems to be the only one new money trusts. Plus new people only know bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:14:26
Bch bad choice. Check out david hay. He has bee n at this a year now with that area.
@_date: 2019-07-09 15:24:49
We have 3 more massive pullbacks coming between now and mid August. Lowest i possibly see Btc is around the 9200 to 9500 mark. Come mid sept the price will keep going up.
@_date: 2019-07-17 15:02:02
Search Andreas Antonopolous on youtube. The best there is.
@_date: 2019-07-09 00:51:00
Go back to school first. Then pass gr8 math. Then you can answer it yourself.
@_date: 2019-07-21 19:14:04
It was 50 btc per block and almost nobody mined. Some good docs showing how a few became wealthy from it.
@_date: 2019-07-10 14:55:51
Yes. But it is very fast. My guy gets in and tries for 1 to 3 pct then yanks it out. Rinse repeat but pay attention or get stuck.
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:35:27
Exodus wallet for laptop. Very easy to use. Super solid.
@_date: 2019-07-02 02:09:32
Check rfaucets. I have a lot of vids showing how to collect free crypto. Few thousand btc sats.
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:51:04
Its been late nights here. Mid day now. I think we are starting wave 3. So minor pullbacks then a heavy push. I do vids on youtube. Mightiest helmutz.
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:54:35
Working on it. Just searching news first. I will post asap.
@_date: 2019-07-04 04:16:12
12650 max tonight. Low 11525. For a few more hours lolol
@_date: 2019-07-04 22:20:55
He is the best.
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:47:10
See last years charts at this time. Same trends and patterns since April 2018. A week of sweet followed two weeks of shit. We should see another pullback then a rush to 15k then massive pullback.
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:23:55
Forget your 2 week crap. End of sept. Not hard to figure out if anyone read or did some study. Too many lazy.
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:28:02
All shit but telegram...waste of money and time.
@_date: 2018-08-08 22:09:19
Wallet. Sign up to an exchange. Kyc full id. Transfer from bank into example coinbase then transfer to an exchange and trade..cross fingers and trade or hold.
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:49:22
Same here. We average in each two weeks and hold long. Long being a minimum of 3 years for us. Make sure you get a wallet as well.
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:30:31
Due to Etfs dates and announcements. Follow the path and the charts are identical. To easy. I like you predict and have been accurate since Feb. So to stay any pct is simply to easy. Bet on a high price and lets see how you predict. Easy in a bear market.
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:25:34
 rule in crypto is proving something is real to yourself. Once lost you arent getting it back. Do your own research and stop trusting things you dont even know.
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:59:26
Yup and yup. This is an amazing time to accumulate. Watch the 24 hr volume and this market is getting close to exploding. Smart money has been punishing idiot traders since April. Hold for a couple more years bro all will be good late 2020.
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:39:27
I laugh at them. Btc will never ever be under 5500 again. All them charts and death crosses and so on and always wrong.
@_date: 2018-08-03 18:39:37
Few spots on freemont. Was there last week...should be called freakmont. Such a good time. Btc big signage.
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:18:33
Lol. Never invested. Eos is a shit coin. Larimer has also left on bad terms every project hes worked on. I buy Btc and earn a shitload of passive income.
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:25:50
Just sell it and move on. If you need convincing your investing in the wrong field...Btc doesnt need a shiller from reddit lol.
@_date: 2018-08-05 00:39:42
Next week the push upwards begins.
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:45:13
Why cant anyone just come and say...if bcash tried this shit in the real world Ver and his cronies would either be back in jail again or facing massive lawsuits...rather than arguing brand ripoff artists which they are. Argue some truth rather crying over deleted posts.
@_date: 2018-05-04 04:32:15
If no help yet..try canadian bitcoins in ottawa or quadriga in BC...full setup needed.
@_date: 2019-11-17 04:37:19
I get that monthly from crypto tab browser.
@_date: 2019-11-18 07:26:48
On your bike....
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:31:02
If he didnt understand. A satoshi is the decimal points. 1 satoshi is the bottom.
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:14:42
Belfort exploited greed. Mcafee fixed problems. Mcafee in my view should be considered a mad quack. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:15:44
Ah....what ? Ask the question better.. money in any wallet is perfect ��
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:29:13
Hold long. 2020 to spring 2021. We will be good. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:37:19
My bad. Apologies. Never heard of it.
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:18:18
You guys actually think btc will bottom to 2k ? Like seriously....5450 last week was the lowest you will ever see btc again..2k lmao...
@_date: 2018-06-25 04:14:09
Max lo...5450 ever...the tough stretch is almost over. 3 more weeks of being cheap. Then thats it.
@_date: 2018-06-26 02:37:19
Im the same. The true cap is 180 billion. The 180 to 230 are you and me. We aint selling ��. Thats why i said 5450 max low. Plus summer.
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:52:32
Lol..maybe i joined late..like my time in reddit means something lmfao..i wish you good luck. Few more weeks than we can take jabs.
@_date: 2019-08-08 23:31:36
DCA for last 20 months. Highest i bought last year at 8500 and bought all the way down to 3100. My average price of btc is 4800. Holding till 2021 ish.
@_date: 2019-08-10 02:11:22
Then add in the remainder. Easy.
@_date: 2019-08-06 09:07:31
To be able to use btc as a everyday debit card anywhere in North America.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:43:59
Lol...each one of them keeps adding a new date. By xmas 2020 BTC will be worth 684,000.00.
@_date: 2019-08-09 06:34:31
Both. I DCA for some and swing trade to increase my bags. Day trading is difficult and with todays market getting smashed its easy to get wiped out without exp.
@_date: 2018-06-26 15:15:29
Previous history. Life cycles. Global awareness. Certain govt budgets etc.. a lot of factors. This will be a good last 6 months of 2018. It will start sooner like mid late july and take off early oct by my math. I have a bunch on FB predicted since march at 100 %. Data dash group. So i dont post litely.
@_date: 2019-08-08 02:57:06
Without spending check out my vids in r/faucets. Easiest is by simply using the crypto tab browser. A decent laptop earns about 1000 sats per day. Many ways to earn free crypto.
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:46:15
IMO only id say between now and early july..i said it would hit 9k 3rd week july...who knows what till then...should start to slowly regain.
@_date: 2019-10-18 06:13:15
Yup. Cant mention bitcoin around anyone i know now. I stopped DCA and now collect just free crypto and add to my stacks. Entered April 2018.
@_date: 2018-06-23 23:49:50
At coinbase. Quad is 30k after all verifies and your bank is accepted.
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:19:58
Really..maybe go back and research the man. Who cares about his twitter. If you cant DYOR you shouldnt even spend a penny. Like buying cuz a youtuber said its good. The man is a mess but it doesnt take away he is borderline brilliant.
@_date: 2018-06-26 05:47:36
Save this one. Im going the other way. 9k 3rd week july.....25k oct 50k xmas..come back and smack me on these dates.
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:39:24
People do trades. Dollars arent everything. Ever heard of the barter system ?
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:45:05
No. People will do whatever it takes. The US dollar still needs to go...but there is nothing else. Crypto still years away.
@_date: 2019-10-21 22:46:52
Faucet. Browser. Ads. Youtube mightiest helmutz.
@_date: 2018-06-13 05:13:02
Take some of that 500 and buy a ledger direct from the manufacturer. Worth it.
@_date: 2019-10-18 06:16:17
So what..trucks shakers fuel must be free to mine gold ? Btc has a lot of utility. Still new and will be new to the world for years to come.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:27:27
Perfect time to get in. All crypto on sale.
@_date: 2018-06-23 23:49:15
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:32:15
8 i think. 7 tenths of 1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:24:08
Fkrs luv the limelight 
@_date: 2019-10-27 15:41:51
Thats a no. Why. We all have had an equal chance to invest into btc n crypto. The wealthy since 1980 have cut off the public by 95% of private investing.
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:59:59
Lol..i guess reddit is how you DYOR and purchase ?
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:37:50
Its 40 years old. Not 1776 lolol.
@_date: 2018-06-23 18:11:59
Whats changed is purpose. The idea of value rather than usage set crypto back temporarily. Use case is still being worked on. Treat the space like a mutual fund and all is good. Keep looking daily and some hair might get pulled lmao...
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:42:45
Crypto Tab Browser. Closest you can get without spending. Go to r/faucets. I have vids on it.
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:35:52
So true. In 36 hours newbies tasted 18 months of bear. For us, its like meh. 3 days later.....
@_date: 2019-02-09 05:11:22
My buddy got burnt on something called bitcoin..wanted to figure it out..turns out he bought another bit........coin...been hooked ever since.
@_date: 2019-10-11 06:12:52
Section here on reddit. Various vids show how to collect free cryptos.
@_date: 2019-06-06 16:55:48
No timestamp = invalid lol. Check my vids. Called both crashes to the day 8 weeks in advance. Sideways down till mid july fellas. Thats market.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:13:13
Stop n Go. Contracts. Candles. Main thing is each sell off we are getting stronger. Market just had a 30B dump and is already bouncing up.
@_date: 2019-06-02 01:44:13
If you want actual free crypto..go to reddit faucets and watch my videos..i average just over 100$ per month..
@_date: 2019-06-16 09:26:36
Uh no. I will do a vid on it tomorrow. Alts from binance and bittrex got hammered and most of it went into btc. Then profits taken. Game on again.
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:31:36
Bitcoin would be doing what its supposed to do if so many didnt steal its name, brand and everything else with it. Eliminate by selling off everything stealing from bitcoin. As long as it continues who can trust it.
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:41:12
I do. Zero ever right. We are all wrong. Nobody has been correct or close.
@_date: 2019-12-16 05:35:39
When there are countless whale wallets that still buy and have never sold means just wait. Market sucks no new money. There are new wallets buying huge amounts at 7k to 7.2k..just more time needed. The halving only works this time if the media drives it thats it. If i mean if it follows the LTC halving we could see 400 percent from january till may...media drives the market still.
@_date: 2019-12-18 04:19:37
Love it...i have spoken.
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:24:41
Well said.
@_date: 2019-12-19 02:32:49
Congrats..rack n stack the sats.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:18:17
Better yet. Just repost this when bitcoin hits 7k..which wont be anytime soon. Solid trade but dont wait to long....
@_date: 2019-12-26 20:11:33
Totally. Hope it gets rid of most.
@_date: 2019-12-16 05:26:23
All scams.
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:25:03
Well said.
@_date: 2019-12-16 05:24:14
2020 mostly the same. Should get globally interesting by end 2020. My govt talked about digital change over but taking 2 to 3 more years.
@_date: 2019-12-19 02:36:03
Idiot. Big wallets buy 800 million worth. Take ur piddly dumb shit and learn the blocks.
@_date: 2019-12-26 20:10:09
Check Nexo. Loans for a lot of crypto. Use crypto as collateral get cash back.
@_date: 2019-12-19 02:31:58
You think that at 1 exchange caused it...stop investing. Your clueless.
@_date: 2019-12-19 02:40:39
K. 1 time. Its open ledger. So we can watch every wallet move in and out. A few million is nothing and no pressure. You can see every whale wallet in action. Pressure low comes after massive liquidation.
@_date: 2019-12-18 04:12:42
Ramped up big time. Country is on a verge of collapse. Local bitcoins recorded all time highs this month..
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:02:18
The limit increase at coinbase. We did the same. A credit card is instant on coinbase no wait. We did the week by week DCA and after it moves to 200 then 500 per week. If you can wait week by week.
@_date: 2019-05-16 07:29:57
Ive said it in my videos many times. There is obviously a coordinated move. The 15 billion adds n dumps we see are cycled. This market mirrors last April and May. If we dump 15 billion next week its right on schedule. A handful of taylor masons lol..
@_date: 2019-05-31 03:43:25
Cryptocompare.com...free. Create a portfolio date it and price..see how you do.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:19:55
Check out RT Max Keiser from yesterday. I think thats what your looking for. Great view.
@_date: 2019-05-23 21:15:50
Lol. Nice but not. Follow the cryptographers from that era....you will get a better answer and no the US govt couldnt 51% attack btc or ever shut it down. Thumbs up for a good post.
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:08:25
Ya me. Youtube channel. Mightiest helmutz. Been calling it since january. Come visit.
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:49:45
Lol...fkn rookie...his statement is within a decade...generalizing is total bs. Timestamp it and be a man. I did a video on this earlier. Search mightiest helmutz on youtube. I expain this bs.
@_date: 2019-05-31 02:29:20
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:09:02
I would say this..it is an amazing time for an everyday person to use btc to get ahead down the road. If you believe like me..then a few hundred or a couple of thousand can go a long way.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:22:53
Come to reddit for zero care except ones own portfolio. Check out RT Max Keiser. Yesterdays video will answer your questions.

Twice a month since April 2018.
