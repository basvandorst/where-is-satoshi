Option 1: they really have technical or i-don't-know-what issues that will be solved quickly and all this noise is nonsense that gives a bad image of Bitcoin
Option 2: they really have liquidity problems and the funds will be frozen for a while but not "lost" as the company is registered in a country where consumers also have rights
No matter what, flying to Japan to protest without having more information is completely stupid (and hard to believe that anyone flights to Japan *only* for that).
It only contributes to giving a bad image of Bitcoin and its community, which is not really what it needs.
Conclusion: keep quiet and wait. Thanks.

Fiat works fine... if you're patient!

Can't it just be gox's investigation over their accounts?

They do rent real offices as well, don't count your chickens before they have hatched.

And what *new* information did you obtain that the "~~big~~ *smart* players" didn't already know, quietly sitting and waiting in their sofa?
What a waste of time and energy, whose only outcome is to sully further the image of Bitcoin to the eyes of the general public.
Unless having concrete and verifiable information, please think twice before posting.

You're way too much US focused my friend. US isn't the center of the world and MtGox is in Japan ran by non-US citizens.
End of the story.

That's what you don't get: no it's not your money. It is the money the bank is kindly (and under many restrictions) keeping for you, as long as they want.
Which is what bitcoin is fighting against.

Although I understand your anger, calling her names won't really make anything better...

Why don't you update the article instead of crying here?

Or he just didn't fill a claim to not be listed there.

Yeah, sure.

Because you're missing a point: unlike technology, humans don't change. Their appetite for personal success won't change so Coinbase is just another capitalist company trying to get as many customers as possible.
Simplifying everyone's life is only secondary.
Why would you directly send them coins (using Bitcoin benefits and making everyone but you happy), missing the opportunity to make another client?
