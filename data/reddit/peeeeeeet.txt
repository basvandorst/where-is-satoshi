Here's one for the Brits! I went to check the price on Coinfloor and this was all I could think:

I suspect it's because it was briefly about this high around the New Year before pulling back quite sharply. Once bitten, twice shy and all that.

Great article, thanks for linking it. Clarifies some things that I sorta understood but hadn't completely thought through.
To illustrate how absurd this argument is:
If there were a hard fork right now and we awarded the title of "Bitcoin" to whichever chain had the biggest block height regardless of consensus rules, then Litecoin, with its current block height of 1171342, would beat either a BU or core chain, both of which would be way behind at around 458259.

I know they're not really comparable but I'm amused that migration is already higher than for Windows 10!

I can see that going badly.
"Hey Uncle Hank. By my reckoning this paper wallet you gave me five years ago should now be worth half a million dollars, but it's coming up with a zero balance. Fix it for me?"

That image is very misleading. At the "It was right here" point the price has multiplied by *ten* in the space of around two months:
Recent price increase has been pretty fast but nowhere near that fast.

I said it last time, so I'll say it again this time:
"Te.....ll you what, tell you what, it's nine and a half thousand pounds! Let's all sing it! Tell you what, tell you what, it's nine and a half thousand pounds!" - Alan Partridge
Yeeeah, you can keep yer Vergeta! We Brits have our own memes!
OK, so I slept through the actual point where it was £9500...

Watching the snooker here in the UK, so I just read that in John Virgo's voice! This will mean very little to most people, I suppose, but  what the hey :)
