I hate to be generalised but its funny that I am indeed invested in cannabis and crypto. I resent what this implies though. Like it somehow means all millennials are lazy, weed smoking, lay abouts, without a care in the world, who fund illegal activities through crypto. Which is nonsense, and the reason why you should never generalise!
Previous connotations associated with cannabis, are wildly exaggerated and false, largely because it is being looked at from the view that it is an illegal substance in alot of places. 
When the millennials have their way, and they will, big changes will happen in its legalisation, and the industry will legally provide massive profits to its early adopters, who understood its benefits. As for crypto, thats what we are all here for. Out with the old ways in with the new. Taking power away from those that have abused it and distributing power back to the people.

I expect world leaders at G20 to come to a consensus of "do no harm" to Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency. There is no better solution for them, in terms of governments regulating Cryptocurrency. 
If they try to regulate it too much and put it in a box, they will miss out on all the advantages that blockchain technology can bring to the modern world. The benefits of this technology, have not yet been fully realised. A "do no harm" approach is necessary as the technology needs time to mature. It would be wise to support its growth, instead of attack it.

True millennials, like me, disassociate themselves from the mongomy of loving bitcoin or stocks. We love wholly and honestly all forms of �� ��������Ⓜ️ accumulation.
