Wallstreet has an announcement on their stance on Bitcoin and some of these types of places are apparently going to start offering futures in Bitcoin. This means they could either be betting to short the market (that it'll crash) or help invest in it with their clients from what I understand. As somebody already mentioned, the answer for the best time to invest will always be yesterday. Get in as soon as you're able to because the trend is always on an upward incline even with all these little fluctuations up and down. As always, treat your investment like you're throwing it off a cliff and you'll never see it again.

Well, I'd first be extremely pissed because I bought in around $10k but I'd be happy to get a ton of whole coins.

Dude, back when it hit $400 I thought that was laughable and didn't invest because I thought it was way overpriced and it'll crash. I even tried downloading a wallet and getting in but I didn't really try and figure it out and sorta forgot about it. Biggest regret ever.

It absolutely applies here, and it's why I'm torn. It can go either way. I guess at the end of the day it only matters if you can afford to risk it.

Sell 5 or 10 of them now, HODL the rest.

If it goes down to $30 per coin I'll be buying 500 of them

Yeh exactly. I have a few whole coins in ETH because I like the idea that something will eventually trigger it if/when Bitcoin either becomes too expensive or somebody corrupts the market.

Lol same. When it was at $700 then dropped to $400 I told myself I'd buy $5,000 worth...Then I didn't do it.. Fuck me.
