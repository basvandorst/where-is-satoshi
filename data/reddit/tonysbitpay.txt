We will see, as a security-focused company we like to keep a lot of our analytics in house but I can say it was our most successful social campaign by a wide margin.
@_date: 2014-12-28 03:11:24
The larger a business is, the more they have to vet any technology to make sure it makes sense for them.
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:06:30
Since there were so many people involved we do not know yet. But I can't wait to see those numbers, sorry for the lack of information but we just don't have it yet.
@_date: 2014-12-27 06:51:20
I truthfully do not know the exact answer to this question past what numbers were shared last month.

I spoke to our client-ops director and this was a case where our customer support did not live up to it's usual great reputation. 
We are in contact with a representative from their team and hope to have the issue resolved as soon as possible. It was a mistake on our end that we are working to ensure will never happen again.
We also will provide the representative will have an improved method of contact should a similar issue arise again in the future.
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:18:32
Absolutely! We are all about our hometown and hired a local production company and local talent. Thanks to Felton Interactive for everything.

We can't convert previous donations to a fiat currency, it has to be donations that were collected through BitPay.
@_date: 2014-12-28 02:02:42
I'm not endorsing them, I'm saying that I think they matter and that they have a chance to succeed.
I endorse nothing, just stating my opinion.
@_date: 2014-11-20 22:30:06
Not only is Shooter a great guy, his music kicks ass and reminds me of the Country music I grew up on, rebellious, thoughtful and just awesome.
Working with him has been a treat and he's done so much for the bitcoin community that I would encourage everyone to support him.
Plus that VHS video is neat!
@_date: 2014-12-28 00:35:22
Thanks and I made an edit to clarify
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:13:37
Thank you very much, glad that people enjoyed it.
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:36:24
Microsoft, NewEgg, Warner Brothers, TigerDirect, American Red Cross, Greenpeace, Save The Childre, EFF, Archive.org, The Sacramento Kings and many more. My favorite though is Black Country Rock who are a killer indie record label and HelloMerch that sells Death Grips merchandise :-)
Edit: I am drinking and partying a bit and thought Shooter Jennings signed Emperor and Mayhem for a minute, sorry Shooter, I knew better!
@_date: 2014-11-26 22:36:29
American Red Cross' donation page is now operational, please donate: [
Apologies on the technical issues but it is fixed and working fine! Thanks for your patience.
@_date: 2014-12-25 22:21:02
Warner Bros. Records, Save The Children, Greenpeace, 50 Cent, Twitch and The Sacramento Kings signed up with us this year.
I consider them all well known but we can let Reddit decide if they belong in the same class as those above.
@_date: 2014-12-07 18:58:14
Sorry for the slow reply, but I just saw this.
I'm not 100% sure on their process so this isn't a definitive answer, but if it is or isn't, we would love to work with them to make the process as easy and fast as possible.
I just spoke with one of our engineers who said it sounds like they use the IPN to flag the account for review which makes the process slower. I'm going to reach out to someone at Shipito to see if we can improve the process.
@_date: 2014-09-17 18:51:50
Shooter was on my podcast too and he was fantastic, getting to know him through the Bitcoin community has been such a treat. Check it out if you would like: [Decentralize](
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:23:26
I am, unfortunately the after party doesn't have any Magners :( But still enjoying it :-)
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:13:29
Thanks for the kind words! We shared information about your business on our Twitter account, we would also recommending getting your information out on all the Bitcoin Databases like AirBitz and Yelp.
@_date: 2014-10-10 22:35:37
Thanks! We want to make sure companies know that we monitor Reddit and social for customer support and to show we want their business.
I don't want to share my email with everyone but if someone from Vimeo or any other merchant are interested in getting set up, feel free to drop me a message on Twitter [
@_date: 2014-12-27 06:55:00
Thanks! I've been at BitPay since March and the growth I've seen in the technology has been astounding. So many brilliant people in this industry, just look at Andreas who has done more for this technology than anyone else. That man not only deserves an award, he deserves a day named after him.
@_date: 2014-12-06 01:16:41
For new users, I make it a point to use the Pheeva wallet and recommend Circle as the best place to get Bitcoin, this site has neither.
Making it easy is the key to reach the next group of converts.
@_date: 2014-11-26 14:59:16
Yes, we had them go through our normal compliance procedures which requires an EIN number and photo ID.
@_date: 2014-10-26 07:42:36
Please still make sure a formal ticket is opened through the website, just to make sure that it goes through the regular process as it is a weekend and I want to make sure you get your problem solved.
@_date: 2014-12-30 21:47:56
Is it the layout, aesthetics, clarity or something else that concerns you? Was there a certain example of a situation that led to an issue? 
@_date: 2014-12-28 00:57:18
Thank you for the compliment, our social campaign was the part that wanted to incentivize new users and so far all signs seem positive.
@_date: 2014-12-30 02:04:32
Thanks for the compliment (although our entire support team are extremely bright and friendly) but in this case it was an error on our part. We try to provide fantastic support to every merchant, but mistakes can and do happen. On our end, we admit they happen, do whatever we can to make things right and try to do everything so they do not happen again.
@_date: 2014-12-10 23:22:12
Don't take anyone's investment advice, ever. 
But you can do this: Research the technology and see if it's solving a problem, then see if you think there are enough resources around for it to solve that problem. If after understanding this, decide if you are willing to risk some money betting on this to become bigger.
I did that, and I decided it was, but I could be wrong because I am human.
@_date: 2014-12-29 01:38:40
I didn't watch the newest episode so you may be right, but he also did perform on the MSG House Show which infers he may be doing something like Tyson Kidd and appearing on both shows.
As a fan though, I bet he's much better on NXT than on the main roster.
@_date: 2014-12-30 19:08:10
We do not disclose customer tier options and never will.
Our response times for every level customer support (including free) exceed industry standards and we agree, it's  and so far it has an excellent reputation. That reputation is why we immediately reach out to make sure issues like this are isolated, the customer is taken care of and that they never happen again.
One of the benefits on being a payment processor is that the support provided for those using our Free Plan still significantly exceed reported response times from our competition. Ensuring merchant support for every tier is our main goal and doing a search on Reddit ensures that this reputation is fairly consistent beside the occasional missteps such as this.
@_date: 2014-12-24 20:24:55
Yes it does!
@_date: 2014-10-26 00:17:55
Hey Tony S from BitPay here, we want to help out and make sure everything is okay. Have you opened a support ticket? If not you can do so [here]( someone on our support team should be able to get back with you pretty quickly.
I also forwarded this to the support team so they should be expecting/looking for a ticket.
@_date: 2014-10-20 03:21:48
Much of the text was written by the event planners, I want to focus more on what points I should hammer home. I'm very comfortable giving an open and honest discussion without going overboard on hype or promise.
I really am speaking on what embracing something forward thinking could do for the city and not as much as just on BitPay. I do plan to discuss what we do, but I want to go into other aspects of the technology and how it could be applicable to the manufacturing industry as the area has a heavy manufacturing audience.
I've been at BitPay for a while and am super comfortable speaking about bitcoin in public and in front of any audience, I just am hoping some in this this community can potentially get some business leaders interested in attending. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:09:44
When you are coordinating a campaign like we did tonight, you don't get to watch much of the game. From what I saw on twitter, people liked it!
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:50:49
You are very welcome, I sent an email out and hopefully we can fix this issue!
@_date: 2014-12-27 06:41:24
I can't really give the company line on that.
As for myself personally, they aren't the ones offering 0% fees.
@_date: 2014-12-27 23:01:45
Thanks, it's going to be an interesting week for me personally.
@_date: 2014-12-22 07:28:19
Hey Tony S from BitPay here.
If you come to the fan zone at Ferg's before the game, I will be glad to find you some swag for yourself and for the game. Just follow me on Twitter [ and send me a tweet
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:45:12
Thanks! Hopefully I'll get to see you in a couple weeks!
@_date: 2014-12-27 06:52:15
it's Joe or Alan! Meeting Damian Abraham was a personal thrill! Still disappointed he never hit me up about bitcoin because I think it would make for a fascinating Vice special.
@_date: 2014-11-26 02:34:36
I reached out on behalf of BitPay to help them out with a more formal donation button on their page, I hope they get back to me this evening as I would love to get them going as soon as we could.
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:08:32
Always been a Futurist and got into it about 3 years ago, love the technology and thought it was crazy clever. Once you accept it's limitations and understand that it's not just an investment but a network and a new way of using money it puts things into perspective.
The best way is to send them a few dollars via changetip or in person. The best way is getting someone a wallet (I like Pheeva) and sending them some.
@_date: 2014-12-28 01:56:26
Because I'm a firm believer that BitPay's future is an open dialogue with people who support the company and bitcoin. 
I also wanted to make a splash and then make myself more known to this community. I'm the "home team" at BitPay; I don't go to the conferences or speak publicly on behalf of the company or bitcoin and I realized that it has resulted in my voice not really being known or heard.
There are some amazing people in this community and I just felt it was about time I made myself known within it and stopped keeping myself "faceless". 
@_date: 2014-12-29 01:26:08
He's actually a fantastic wrestler who is on the main roster, and from what I understand is the guy who helped The Rock prepare for his return. I can't say enough for how enthusiastic and open minded he was to do this on very little notice.
And for the old school fans, he's Mr. Perfect's son :-)
@_date: 2014-11-20 03:53:41
Hey Tony Sakich from BitPay here,
We have a solution for you [here]( and would love to have your business. I would be glad to get you in touch with someone in person if you are interested to talk to someone one-on-one who can help you out.
To be clear, we have been offering Payroll since January and it has been used by Zuman and Incoin among others.
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:25:16
It's something we have considered now and in the past, but we realized that the mainstream audience wouldn't know what to make of it, we want new bitcoin users who are tech savvy enough to be on social media and understand/know how to figure out what to do.
The bowl game was to increase awareness of bitcoin, the social campaign was to give the right audience their first experience with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:13:19
Thank you! Means a lot
@_date: 2014-11-26 18:15:53
We are working with Red Cross to make sure that these issues get fixed as soon as possible.
@_date: 2014-11-27 09:23:32
Erik disagrees with me completely on this post, but engaging in debate with those who disagree with you is important and ultimately proves to everyone that one stands by their beliefs.
No one has called  a paid shill more than myself (I'm  on Twitter BTW) because in my opinion he discredits everything journalism stands for. I would like nothing more than to see Erik debate him in a public forum on this topic.
Freedom and bitcoin seem to always win these sorts of debates so I'm hoping that it happens. Until then I will continue to voice my opinion and hope that Ken proves me wrong by stepping forward and accepting Erik's invitation and it happens in a public forum.
@_date: 2014-11-26 02:45:09
I'm in contact with the director now, he has some questions which I'm personally here to answer (gave him phone and email) and will share any updates. Hoping to get them live as soon as they want.
@_date: 2014-11-13 23:59:09
I for one want this book to exist, it would do a lot of good to educate without going over someone's head. I'm donating.
@_date: 2014-12-28 06:31:12
Their ATM is impressive and the guys really are doing everything they can to be a successful business. I also can't speak enough about their professionalism and how great it was to work with them at the bowl game.
@_date: 2014-12-26 06:42:43
That is definitely the goal :-)
@_date: 2014-10-11 00:18:05
Hey this is Tony S from BitPay, we definitely have the answer to that in that link. I am a big fan of our payroll API as I personally use it to get a portion of my check in bitcoin, so I'm fairly certain it would work well in your situation.
If your employer is sincerely interested have him contact me at tonysakich [at] bitpay.com and I will be glad to get him in contact with the person who handles our integrations on the Payroll side.
We know one of the biggest issues is how to get Bitcoin and getting some in payroll is so awesome and easy that it's very little hassle for any payroll company.
@_date: 2014-12-29 04:24:14
Apparently he is doing NXT which I hope will be similar to what they have done with Tyson Kidd where he is a consistently entertaining performer on all shows and is given time to show how great he is on NXT.
NXT is my personal favorite weekly WWE show and it's incredibly easy to watch. If it really is all Triple H and one writer they are doing a phenomenal job and deserve the fruit basket sent him (actually they should send one to the writer too, I wish I remembered his name).
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:09:11
Not too sure, probably a long nap and going to watch some wrestling! As far as in Bitcoin, it's all about user adoption and finding the best technology out there
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:21:58
:-) Thank you! Also be sure to thank ChangeTip and Shooter Jennings as well as they helped a lot to ensure they could handle the traffic and helped setting up our guest tippers. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 02:02:11
The Pheeva guys are great and deserve this, they also have my favorite wallet to use by a wide margin. Please support this as I will!
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:21:14
It was the first time anything bitcoin related trended nationwide so I would say yes in that aspect. We also introduced many new people to bitcoin which is always a giant win.
@_date: 2014-12-29 04:13:22
Absolutely not, Shooter Jennings reached out to him as they are friends and he was happy to take part. WWE is really big on Social Media and he saw it as an opportunity to do something never done before. He actually did it after his match at Madison Square Garden, so it was incredibly cool for him to help out.
None of the guest tippers were personally paid for their participation, they were all companies and people that I personally developed relationships with either through my job or through Shooter Jennings. They all believe in BitPay and believe in Bitcoin and have had a wonderful experience using us and were happy to help us out.
Joe is a bit new, but saw a good idea and didn't want to see it pass by. Yes, BitPay has nurtured relationships with some more notable personalities and companies interested in bitcoin, but they are all supportive enough of what we do and how we conduct business that they did not ask to be compensated.
This is something I wanted to say from the start so I am extremely happy you asked that question for that reason. We make sure that all of our merchants remain happy with our service, and Shooter Helped a lot.
@_date: 2014-12-27 06:48:53
We realize that the success to bitcoin is consistent, open-source development of the bitcoin protocol and technologies surrounding it so supporting that is always a priority.
BitPay also focuses on merchants as we are exclusively a payment processor. Our client operations and compliance team's only concern is to continue to make the onboarding process easier and the level of customer service superior to not only every other bitcoin payment processor, but every other payment processor period.
Most things in running a successful business haven't changed, and providing quality customer service along with addressing concerns in a human way is what we do. No company runs error-free, but good companies admit their mistakes and try to do everything they can to make them right for the customer. So far, we feel we have done a good job at that.
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:29:22
Firstly, this is my opinion and not the opinion of the company.
The number of people using bitcoin keeps growing, the number of merchants keep growing and the amount of investment in the technology's infrastructure keeps growing. Those are metrics that mean the use is growing and that it is being taken more seriously.
I do have some bitcoin I'm keeping for savings, but I don't worry much about the price at all because it keeps getting easier and easier to use. Seeing how hard it was to acquire and use bitcoin 3 years ago vs. how it is now really shows the growth.
So in other words, I have no idea what it's worth in a year, I just want to be able to use it for all my day to day purchases.
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:11:00
Someone from our team looked for an issue like this in an open ticket but didn't find one, can you open a support ticket so we can get you an answer here? 
Apologies on taking so long for catching this post. Just as a head's up though, whenever there is an issue opening a support ticket will ensure we can take care of you ASAP. Please open a ticket and we will be happy to take care of your issue.

The Fragile but Year Zero is my favorite :-)
And thanks for everything Shooter, you are the definition of gentlemen
@_date: 2014-11-26 04:53:44
Thanks again to everyone here for making this public, I made a separate post for this but I wanted to reply and let the community know that you can donate to them [here](
Speaking on behalf of myself and not BitPay here (although I doubt the company would disagree) libraries are wonderful places that give people free and equal access to information. I am personally making a donation to the one place that stayed open amid the turmoil in the city.
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:30:36
Comfortable to say that more people have been exposed to bitcoin than ever before.
@_date: 2014-12-29 23:53:55
Our support team is doing everything they can to fix this situation, mistakes happen and we are doing everything we can to ensure they are taken care of.
@_date: 2014-10-10 17:25:00
I reached out on behalf of BitPay, definitely would love to have them as a customer.
@_date: 2014-11-07 05:09:47
I want to see this personally so let's make this happen.
Jeremy is a good guy and this will be a good watch for anyone.
@_date: 2014-12-27 06:41:46
Greatly appreciated and sorry for the slow response, had to take the shuttle to the hotel and the battery died.
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:32:36
Thanks! Loving it all. Be sure to thank Victoria from ChangeTip, Shooter Jennings (seriously, this guy is a legend already and no one even knows), Andreas, J at Warner, Curtis Axel (He's Mr. Perfect's Son!!!), NewEgg, Chaz at BitPay, Adam Hofman from Bitcoin Magazine and so many more people I'm going to kick myself for not thanking. I helped round up the troops but they were the ones who went to war!
@_date: 2014-12-28 02:32:09
If you are viewing them as a cryptocurrency and altcoins then yes they do, I view them more as a decentralized technology and less of an altcoin. I'm speaking more of the litecoins, dogecoins and such of the world.
@_date: 2014-12-29 01:34:55
By "show love" I didn't necessarily mean to just tip him (although that's nice and I do think it shows gratitude). I meant to send him a thank you or give him a retweet if you don't feel comfortable giving someone who makes a nice salary.
I tweeted out his tip.me address but I just posted his Twitter handle here as he is learning a lot about this and interested in how it works. For a person who has an insanely busy travel schedule and a job that's very hard on the body, it's a testament to someone open minded enough to pay attention.
@_date: 2014-12-30 21:43:03
I do not believe it has, if you believe it has an honest chance of happening please contact us and let us know and I would be able to get the person responsible for that decision in contact with someone to help them out with the process.
@_date: 2014-12-02 21:51:49
I am forwarding this to our compliance team, we do recommend all non-profits to upgrade to the highest tier.
Also have you submitted a support ticket?
@_date: 2015-01-06 22:44:32
In addition, Matias from our Argentinian team wrote a great blog post about Copay, so I wanted to share it here as well.
