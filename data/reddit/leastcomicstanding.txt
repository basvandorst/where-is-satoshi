I came here looking for discussion as to why it seems like all the news about BTC has been pretty extremely positive, yet the price is going down or remaining basically stable.
I suppose my thoughts are, that the spending abilities through these new companies, is causing a "release" of the stores of BTC people had.  Then the companies are just liquidating the BTC pretty immediately.
Also, there are probably people who bought a lot, expecting the price to be bolstered by continuous good news, and since that upswing hasn't happened, they gave up and are cashing in some/all of it.

They were probably referring to the bot's signoff message.  :-)

Seems like a great list of charities. I saw a frontpage post about a website that helped you choose what movie to watch. Is there a similar thing for what charity to donate to? A list that is prioritized by "most money going to actual research," or "least negative feedback," might be worth creating.

Antivirus is always a "catch up" game, but even preventing "possible virus activity" doesn't keep people from clicking "yes yes yes" to whatever they want on their computer.  Most people won't use a software that blocks them from doing what they want.  Norton didn't open up a backdoor to let viruses in, it just wasn't able to stop the new type of virus, or the person from clicking "yes, do this despite the potential bad stuff."
Also, some people don't install Antivirus until after they realize they picked up a bug.  Oops.

Not daily.
More appropriately $700,000 - $20,000,000 per year.  Still a large variance, but the smaller one says "conservatively estimated," so a lowball, and the Norton one says "potentially," so probably an upper estimate.
