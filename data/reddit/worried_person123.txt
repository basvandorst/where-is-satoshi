Can someone please tell me what I should be expecting? I have my entire life savings on bitfinex (75% USD equivalent / 25% bitcoin). My exchange wallet seems to be alright, nothing was withdrawn today. Do you guys think I'll be alright?

when will there be a statement?

20 minutes ago you said you would release a statement TODAY?
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:54:47
will people who are holding USD balance who live outside of the US be able to buy bitcoin via bitfinex and withdraw afterwards?

I would like to stress the importance of releasing a statement ASAP. I myself had my life savings stored on bitfinex and I imagine many others had too. I haven't been able to sleep all day and had numerous panic attacks throughout the day. I understand this is a complex situation, but people like me NEED to know what the resolution will be, what percentage of funds stored on bitfinex are left, etcetera. This hack has life changing impact on many of your customers, we deserve to know a rough prediction of what will happen.

I agree that if they manage to pay the customers back in full (or even anywhere close to that) it would hardly damage their reputation, if not strengthen it by showing they care about their customers and are willing to take a hit. If they don't, Bitfinex Limited (and everyone associated with it) will have no future.

Is there any contact with possible investors?

Crying myself to sleep.. life savings tight up in Bitfinex. PLEASE give us some good news tomorrow, I'm praying.

could you give an estimate of when the statement will be released and whether it contains:
1. When bitfinex will be back up
2. If LTC/ETH/ETC/USD balances will be affected
3. What will happen to people whose BTC got stolen
4.  What will happen to people whose BTC didn't get stolen
I think these questions are on everyone's minds. I've been reading/refreshing this page for 19 hours now and so far there hasn't been any useful information - just evasive and vague answers.
I think it is first and foremost important to upgrade the security on bitfinex to prevent customers from withdrawing their funds as soon as the website comes back online. I'm telling you, everyone is aware of how risky the cryptovaluta market is and are willing to share a SMALL percentage of the losses.
As someone who has a lot on bitfinex (mid six figures) I would like to stress that the most important thing is to keep customers no longer in the dark. Be forthcoming in what they should expect and try to resolve the situation as soon as possible. Every other day this takes costs staggering amounts of money and headaches all over the world. Do you share the feedback and suggestions from reddit with your superiors?
