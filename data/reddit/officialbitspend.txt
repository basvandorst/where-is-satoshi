This is in the works.  Once we have the site actually complete and updated, we will be releasing add-ons that you can click, and it will send the URL in directly as an order to us, and load a page for you to fill out your shipping details. We also have a super-secret-sauce app coming out, which will let you do something no other BTC app or service can lay claim too - just wait :)
Dont ever hesitate to toss your ideas out there, we love it!
@_date: 2013-03-08 04:50:37
The feeling is mutual.
@_date: 2013-03-13 21:50:42
We already have his post printed out, for each person to read and make sure we kill all those "cons" immediately.
There were also a few glitches in MWG's system which seem to have caused much of this--like the amounts they listed as charging us being $1~ different than the actual price on the invoice they emailed us before and after paying!
Either way, we have many things we can improve and we will not sleep until we do!
@_date: 2013-03-13 16:32:02
We added that to the bugs list, I'm sure he will fix it today, shortly.  Thank You!
@_date: 2013-03-05 20:06:33
There are a few of us.  
As of right now, we have a couple stragglers we are contacting, but 99% of orders placed HAVE been ordered/placed.
Yes, we do :)
@_date: 2013-03-08 04:40:12
Our basic service which does still provide a level of anonymity and is done in flat rate fees which will be available on the new site on Monday (starting at $2 for orders under $50).  This allows you to buy anything online and pay with bitcoins - from places that do not accept Bitcoins - and have the product shipped directly to you from the seller/store/merchant.  In this case though, you are providing your shipping info to the seller.
The 100% anonymous ordering feature, will be a 5% fee (by itself, **not** in addition to a flat rate fee) and for now will only allow orders up to $300.  We will adjust that limit to much higher amounts in the future.
Feel free to ask us any questions about the service you have - you can also PM or email us for any more private questions.
@_date: 2013-03-08 12:46:57
We believe it is.  The reason being is we are even cutting out things like the "Mail Stations" they described.  The **only** entity that would have **temporary** access to your name and shipping information is us, Bitspend. 
We order your item ourselves to be shipped to our secure warehouse using our information and not yours, and then it is relabeled to be shipped to you by us - so, once we delete your data there is no way to connect you to any purchase whatsoever.  
We, like the creators of APOD, believe in a persons right to buy legal products anonymously without being tracked and cataloged by governments and big-data.
**Note** not to confuse anyone, this is not our only service - you can still use Bitspend.net to order anything from any site online and pay with Bitcoins.  The standard Bitspend service in itself can provide certain levels of anonymity, but cannot guarantee your anonymity the way our new anonymous package can.
@_date: 2013-03-09 17:04:54
I promise to try and answer all your questions as soon as I can today - right now though we are cutting it close to our relaunch time and I have a million things to do!
@_date: 2013-03-04 11:51:56
As we grow and have APIs integrated into the site, we plan on doing exactly that.  It will allow us to calculate the fee based on the current MtGix BTC price and display it to you guys, alongside the USD price.
Thanks for the comment though, it is a needed improvement we plan on implementing.
@_date: 2013-03-11 23:49:21
Well, we could literally handle three out of those four haha :)
@_date: 2013-03-14 00:09:59
Congratulations on the new feature guys!
It's really great that you are now accepting cash payments at thousands of locations using ZipZap.  You guys are doing a great job, and we wish you all the best of luck in growing ZIGGAP in the future :)
@_date: 2013-03-04 23:11:08
Depends on your angle...
@_date: 2013-03-04 09:28:56
[We think so too!](
@_date: 2013-03-11 09:21:25
Over the coming days, you will notice major improvements to the Bitspend ordering process.  By the end of the week, we will have our order system almost 100% automated, making ordering even easier for you!
@_date: 2013-03-04 16:18:44
We have thought about this as well, and more than likely **will** be setting up something like it.
@_date: 2013-03-13 22:00:53


During our initial phase, we have been very soft on our limits, allowing customers to use our service without us hassling them over order amounts.  We will always do this in the future--I see no reason to turn you down for an order because you want one or two extra items, we simply have it there to prevent abuse of the system :)


Whoah!  You found a major bug that we had not been notified of previously!  It also didn't seem to be effecting everyone.  Since this post, we have resolved that issue however and this will never happen again!
@_date: 2013-03-04 06:18:04
For right now, our fees are planned as:
* $0-50 = $2
* $51-100 = $3
* $101-500 = $4
* $501-1,000 = $5
However, we have also been kicking around the idea of having only 2 fees, one for under $200 of $3, and one above $200 of $5.  Know this though, if we do change the pricing it will be lower, not higher.
Thanks for asking!
@_date: 2013-03-13 11:30:40
We gave our server some extra lovin', she feels better now and promises not to give you guys any more hassles :)
@_date: 2013-03-08 06:29:59
We will be launching as a worldwide service from the very start! No extra charges or fees at all simply because you're not in the US, and why would we - you're a person with a Bitcoin just like the rest of us, nationalities and borders mean nothing when it comes to your business and its value to us as a company.
Shipping costs will of course always depend on the location of the product you're buying - but we hope to have shipping warehouses in countries all over the world in the near future, to provide the best service possible to everyone regardless of their location.
@_date: 2013-03-11 13:59:46
We will probably have a blog post about our first official week, including some general stats like how many orders were placed - but right now we're too busy actually processing orders and replying back to everyone to worry about that :)
@_date: 2013-03-11 19:54:15
As in?
When you order the standard order, we have the item shipped **directly to you** from the retailer.  So we dont ship it, the store you ask us to order from does.
If you mean the anonymity package, we use USPS Priority.
@_date: 2013-03-11 11:42:51
We will be shipping using USPS Priority when an item comes through our warehouses. We will also offer insurance(at cost) for those who want it.
Unfortunately, we can only guarantee what the USPS does - and that is the package will get to your country and from there, its up to your local postal service.  
With that being said, we will NEVER turn down a customer who wants to order something just because of where they live.
@_date: 2013-03-04 07:19:52
We've spent some time working it out, all orders are handled manually on almost all sites - and we will offer phone support for orders over $100.  It runs a lot smoother than what we imagine is going through your head haha!
@_date: 2013-03-08 05:05:32
I guess that depends on what you define as hefty, and what total anonymity is worth to each person individually.  Paying $10 on a $200 order for a service which guarantees your anonymity, doesn't seem like all that bad of a deal to me :) 
Keep in mind that there are hefty costs in play when it comes to securing your data, not to mention we can't exactly have all your items shipped to just anywhere and hold them - we need secure warehouses, which can guarantee your items safety and security for the 12 or so hours we have it before it ships to you from us.
However, total anonymity is not important to everyone... that is why we also offer our normal service, which will be under **$**5 for a $200 order.  
@_date: 2013-03-04 08:40:20
We mentioned in a reply earlier, we have already purchased airfare for someone during our closed beta, so it is on the table yes.  This is a more complicated process, and we will in the future add a section with info on these types of orders and how we will handle them.
For now, if you're interested, you can always contact admin with your personal questions and one of us will gladly respond as soon as we can!

It is actually a big priority for us.  We want to have a new logo within the next two to three weeks, before we grow too much.  It was something we initially wanted to go with, and we spent less time on design than we wanted too but needed to get started so we could afford to spend more on the design, etc.... a viscous circle.
If you have any concept ideas, we welcome them :)
@_date: 2013-03-11 19:53:19
We take those on a case by case basis - we are intentionally trying to avoid getting into those sketchy grey areas, but once we have time to build up our super-mega-legal-stuff, and we know for sure what we can send and what we cant when it comes to that stuff, we will have a more detailed FAQ.
For now, ask yourself - is it illegal/prohibited where I am getting it delivered?  Where it is shipping from? Where it is traveling through?  If you answered yes to any, we wont order it.
@_date: 2013-03-05 06:51:15
I just high-fived you, not sure if you noticed... but it just happened.
@_date: 2013-03-30 03:31:10
As a business who deals in nothing but BTC, I can tell you that we rarely wait for 6 confirmations before considering a payment as "final".  
In many cases, a single confirmation is enough for us to process the order that was placed.  However, when we are talking thousands of dollars in a single transaction, we of course wait the extra time for confirmations, as a simple safety measure.
@_date: 2013-03-11 20:08:01
No problem!
@_date: 2013-03-04 09:36:19
Some do some don't. 
Listed on our things to research, is a list of Hotels we can setup a partnership with on exactly something like this - where we can place the room on hold, and cover the standard rates, etc... but the customer will be forced to place a CC on file for additional costs.
Thank you for the comment though, its ideas like this that drove us to build Bitspend!
@_date: 2013-03-12 21:18:26
When we release the new site, the automated ordering form will make it a breeze to order multiple items, and you wont have to add them to a "notes" section like you do now.
As we grow, we promise to continually fight to make it easier and easier for you to use Bitspend to purchase ANYTHING :)
@_date: 2013-03-11 21:22:16
It depends on where you ordered it from.  For the most part, sites like Amazon - exchanges can be made by you directly, since you are given the "gift" invoice for that specific reason.
Refunds work the same way.  You send it back as directed by the retailer, and as soon as our accounts are credited the refund, we refund your BTC in full!
@_date: 2013-03-11 16:34:00
Glad to see our customer service team is taking care of you :)
@_date: 2013-03-06 00:25:53

Most major retailers offer this and we will ALWAYS use this option when available, and as we get further along we will be streamlining this process and working with vendors to build a relationship with them as well.
Also, since we place the order - we know if shipping is paid, and also what type of refund is offered by the seller.  Since we are ordering from the link you give us to order from, its your responsibility to know their policies - we are as you said, just the middle man :)
@_date: 2013-03-04 15:11:31
Your hopes are in the works... soon my friend, soon.

@_date: 2013-03-11 16:41:56
 Service:
You give us your shipping info and the URL to the item(s) you want, and pay us in BTC.  We place the order, using your shipping details.  This is no different than you ordering yourself - the retailer still gets your shipping info, etc.
 Anonymity:
You give us the URL for the item(s) you want, and your shipping info.  However, this time we order the item **without** your info and have the item shipped to our secure warehouse.  We then relabel it for shipment to you, within 24 hours of receipt.  This way, in the end, there is no connection between you and your order.

@_date: 2013-03-04 10:43:35
Absolutely.  We actually already do, we just don't advertise it yet and have only provided service to those who asked.  Once we have had time to build more internally, we will offer much more in terms of service both internationally and over-all.   We plan on allowing you to place bit-coins on the site and automate your order, among other things.  
@_date: 2013-03-05 01:53:46
We will be, yes - so we will be able to offer free shipping on most orders!
@_date: 2013-03-04 07:49:30


There are 4 of us right now, and we each have a love of bitcoins.  We will be keeping a percentage of all orders as BTC in our cold storage(its just a great investment we believe).  Much of it will be converted in order to cover the credit lines we use to actually place and pay for your orders - but we will keep as much in BTC as possible, whenever possible.  Yes, the four of us so far will be taking our pay in BTC, and it will be an offer to any new employee going forward as well (they can split it how they want).


1.  Yes, we order and use your shipping - however since your BTC are paid into our "pool" and all the orders are placed using our credit lines, there is no way to actually **definitively prove** that any one client of ours used any specific BTC on any specific order.  Read our Privacy Policy on how we destroy ALL data regarding your order, even your email address - after the order has been confirmed on your end.
2.  We are actually planning a few different *tiers* per-se.  We're going to offer smaller fees for those who can wait 48 hours before we place their order, and also exactly what you described where we have it shipped to us and then we re-ship to you... again deleting your order records once you confirm receipt/satisfaction with your order.
@_date: 2013-03-11 23:49:29
LOVE YOU!
@_date: 2013-03-11 21:16:42
Its a soft limit - we can handle orders up to 10k!
If you would like to discuss in private what you're ordering, so we can discuss the shipping -- feel free to email orders or even justin we will make sure you are taken care of :)
@_date: 2013-03-04 12:38:35
He wont let me tell you :*(
I even tried winking seductively, and asking please... he said "nope" lol.   has to do with a major feature we are planning for the coming weeks/months :)
@_date: 2013-03-04 19:05:12
We are in discussions with someone to partner with them for exactly this.  We will offer you the ability to setup monthly recurring BTC payments, and as long as your monthly payment is made - we will continue paying for the service.
We are working on the details though, as some sites wont be allowed, for legal reasons of some sort or another - but your idea in general, is definitely being worked on.
@_date: 2013-03-04 07:13:03
The Cylons will be here before that happens...
@_date: 2013-03-11 10:12:28


Yes there is!  Which is also why starting next week, **ANYONE in South Florida is invited to come visit our offices**.  Heck, we'll even sell you some BTC if you need them :)
Our office address will be listed on the site next week, and we WANT you guys to stop by!


For cases like this, which would be VERY rare - we will upon request store your data in our encrypted storage until you request it be wiped.


Anything provided by the retailer **you** have chosen for your product, we provide you :)


We have methods in place for exchanging, returning, etc.  We will handle it all for you either by providing you with the return address or having you ship to us to return it for you - and should you get a refund from the retailer, we will refund your BTC immediately upon our receiving the refund.
@_date: 2013-03-04 06:35:36
We thought about this a lot.  99 out of 100 times, if you order from somewhere reputable you wont be returning it anyways - however if you do we have a plan in place.  You will receive a refund in BTC equal to your original cost - we'll even refund your fee :)
@_date: 2013-03-11 16:45:57


We dont determine shipping charges on our Standard order.  That all depends on where you tell us to order from and their shipping.
On the Anonymity Package, yes, there would be shipping because we are the ones shipping it to you -- after it is shipped to us.  We use the Priority Flat Rate boxes to ship in the fastest time while keeping the cost down.
@_date: 2013-03-04 12:40:54
I will check, more than likely it means there is an image being called from outside the site (for instance, if we are testing a new page and place a stock image from  instead of one on our own server) it will give you that error.
I will look into that, and get it fixed asap whatever it is!
@_date: 2013-03-08 18:27:49
We love you too :)
@_date: 2013-03-18 07:34:00
Hey guys,  this is Justin from Bitspend.  
I was just awoken to a phone call telling me someone may have leaked a database of our recent orders.  The first thing I did before even checking the post was to log into the server and remove any files that had been used to relay information to us for ordering.
I have not yet read through the pasted information in the link, however I can tell you that the new server and ordering form we have moved to are NOT, in any way shape or form, effected by whatever this person claims to have done(again I have not verified anything).
To make it clear, we have(now had) three different directories we were using to  test different versions of apps, and many of them were filled with test/false-user information.  I do not know which one this person seems to have, and if any of this turns out to be real we will first contact those involved. 
I can assure you that any orders being placed with our new system, are not vulnerable to this type of attack.  I will comment later when I know whether this is an elaborate hoax or a truly unfortunate event.
We are removing all ordering functions until we know what if any issues there actually are.
[edit, the actual response](

1.  Thank you so much for taking the time to give us that feedback.  While we plan on continuing to build on and customize bootstrap, we are in no way the best at it.  We plan on bringing in someone in-house to rebuild from the ground up and also build the APIs we have in mind, mobile apps, etc.  Your thoughts are dead on, and we promise to continue to update and upgrade our site to offer the best functionality possible.
2.  But, but, but we're trying!!  We promise to get that fixed in the coming weeks - I'm writing it on the top of our "fix it" list.

Of course!
Anything you can order online(legal of course!) we will happily order for you :)

I told Jessica she has to stay here at the office until you order.  So by all means, take your time my friend!

You're very welcome!
@_date: 2013-03-11 14:22:53
If you're ordering using our Guaranteed Anonymity Package, which uses our secure warehouse as the initial shipping destination and then we ship to you -- we will always do this :)
We take your privacy and anonymity extremely serious and won't take shortcuts in any way!
@_date: 2013-03-04 17:39:07
We've decided to go one further, and just start placing orders for you before you even know you want them.  
The twins from Minority Report are out of work ever since they were let go from their criminal future telling... we're making them an offer now.
@_date: 2013-03-04 10:45:10
As we grow and gain more funding, we promise to have the site completely redone("*you can say we did it because you asked, if thats what you're into*"), as well as adding a plethora of new functions and mobile apps for you to order with.

disclaimer:  we had nothing to do with the post, just offering our opinion.
They probably got it from the quote on our home page :)


@_date: 2013-03-04 08:06:15
We are actively seeking the partnerships you mention, and it will simply take time.  First, we're going to have to build a trusted name in Bitcoin shopping, and then with that we can leverage partnerships.
When we first started testing it, we didn't know how scalable it would be either - but we were pleasantly surprised at how smooth things run, and don't see any issues in the near future, only opportunities!
@_date: 2013-03-09 01:27:18
We are having internal discussions on partnering with someone like Bufferbox to provide a total anonymous pickup of your package - as a part of our anonymity plan.
Thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2013-03-11 16:31:41


Not at all!  
The ONLY place your data goes, is into our encrypted storage.  We have the package shipped to us, and we send it to you.  No one other than Bitspend has your details - and we wipe them all after you let us know you're satisfied with your product(you don't need to return it or anything)
@_date: 2013-03-04 15:11:03

@_date: 2013-03-14 18:54:49
It was intended to be a feature, which turned into a bug, which was then squashed by the shoe of a new feature, which we hope isn't a bug.
@_date: 2013-03-11 15:55:27
Yeah, we're aware of all the issues and they will ALL be resolved in the coming hours/days.
The order form is **very temporary** as we ran into last minute issues with our automated system and had to resort to the email form until we get it fixed!
The site is undergoing major changes this week as well :)
@_date: 2013-03-11 19:55:59
It will be there very soon.  We had serious unexpected crashes early this morning, which caused us to default to some older/temporary site pages and info.
The full site will be up within 48 hours, after we fix all the shenanigans.
@_date: 2013-03-11 23:42:11
We'll try!
@_date: 2013-03-04 11:05:28


You guys are too smart for your own good!
  We have a PGP section, including a tutorial for new users - going up today!!
@_date: 2013-03-05 05:00:53
Your response is dead on.  Not only that, but we have new features coming out soon which will make it even easier to simply click a button on your browser and place an order for whatever product page your viewing online.
Our goal is to provide a bridge between stores who dont accept BTC yet and their customers - allowing the customer avoid cashing out and exchanging their BTC, and the vendor to be paid in their preferred method.    
@_date: 2013-03-04 07:51:46
We're considering hotels, but the issue is... if we get a room for you, then you can trash it, run up a room-service order, etc - and we're stuck with the bill lol.
BUT, we have already ordered airfare for someone in our 'closed beta', and are hoping to discuss cruises with two major cruise-lines soon
@_date: 2013-03-04 16:27:07
We have discussed this, and it may be an option in the near future.  If and/or when this becomes an option, it will be at a cost lower than btcinstant, with a much higher level of customer support!
(ps., we haven't experienced their customer service, we're just making presumptions because we think we are awesome!)
@_date: 2013-03-12 15:07:23
We do **not** open your package unless neccessary, and we would NEVER open a package without your written approval first.
We only had to do this one time, because the item was such a large and odd shape, that it had to be repacked or cost the customer about 800% more in shipping - that is the ONLY time a package was opened instead of just repackaged in our box.
@_date: 2013-03-13 11:22:13
Thank You!  We will look into that immediately.
[edit] It is being looked into now!
@_date: 2013-03-11 10:42:28
Just because we feel like it - Order between now and 9AM, add "reddit" to your order note, and we will will have the service fee waived :)

Dear Prince Nihasmihamadad's cousin, first off we're sorry for his unfortunate demise - we only hope he left you some of that fortune he is sharing with us.
You're right, the scenario you mention is a reason we havent gone into that yet.  However, I do believe there are a couple hosts out there who will allow you to pay in BTC who also respect your privacy + you can signup and always log into your hosting account through a VPN or Tor and that in addition to BTC payments should guard your anonymity for the most part (although I could also be totally wrong, which is why Im not a security specialist for some three letter government agency)
@_date: 2013-03-11 11:57:07


They can give us a hard time if they want to, but we will always fight to make sure your chosen vendor ships you your package.  We havent had any issues with that so far in our closed beta, and we shipped all over the world.


We always work with legal counsel to ensure we will be around for a long time to come, and avoid any issues :)
@_date: 2013-03-11 23:40:57
That is why we have steps in place to ensure that no illicit orders make it through the system.  
There are places online where you can buy that type of thing--and it's not through us!  We do appreciate the comments and thoughts though, thank you!
@_date: 2013-03-18 09:14:57
A few moments ago I was awoken with some very disturbing news.  It seems someone was able to gain access to one of our databases and posted a censored format of it. 
 
While this database was a very small one and was used for testing, it unfortunately did contain some real data from some recent customers.  It was a minimal subset of recent information, and much of it is test data.  We immediately removed all data from the servers.  There was no leak of information from the emails sent back and forth from clients to Bitspend, no bitcoin addresses, card addresses, or any other financial information exposed. I will not try and hide the fact that this happened as that would be pointless, and can only apologize sincerely to the individuals affected by this.  
The database affected was not intended to be used for our actual ordering system and the error was caused by the system posting data to a test database not meant for extended use or storage.  This is not an excuse, but solely an attempt to be honest about what has happened.  Again, we have eliminated *any and all customer data* stored on the server, even data that was not affected by this.
 
We have decided to suspend order taking until we release the new system, and will also wait until after it has been independently audited for security risks and flaws before relaunching.  We are even working on ways to avoid storage of data all together, which will remove the risk of something like this ever happening in the future.  Currently we’re in the process of acquiring an Extended Validation SSL Certificate and removing as many external resources as possible from the site.
 
Our new system will include methods which allow us to avoid even asking you for your email address, and other pieces of information we do not want to collect in the first place.  We are building towards ways to require less and less of your data, as well as moving all our systems to a much more secure hosting environment. 
We’re a small team working on building a secure Bitspend, and from time to time even the largest corporations have security issues.   We are taking all necessary steps to ensure that instances like this do not happen again.  We hope we’ve demonstrated our response and transparency to the issues, and what we are doing to fix them.  Once we have been successfully audited by a third party, and only then, we will re-open the site for orders.
If you have any questions you can call me personally, come by our office, PM us here on Reddit, or contact us in any way you see fit.
My sincerest apologies,
Justin - Bitspend.net

To the places be purchase from, it is **our** billing info - only your shipping info, so as far as chargebacks are concerned, it would be our responsibility.
However, we couldnt run our specific business very long if we reversed the charges we made.  We are in this for the long haul, and even have some super secret APIs being developed, so we wont be reversing any purchases!

You're a smart one :)
This is currently listed as  on our "*big board of sh!t to think about*" hanging about 10 feet in front of me.  It is being discussed and more than likely will be an option in the coming months - without a doubt!
@_date: 2013-03-04 23:10:27
We'll be adding something like this, and hopefully over the next couple weeks we will have the funding issue covered.
@_date: 2013-03-04 16:58:50
It is something we're planning on, and currently discussing with investors.  Hopefully we can add that service within a couple months at the latest.
@_date: 2013-03-11 17:17:23
IF the order comes from a non white-listed site (not from Amazon, BestBuy, etc.) then we review the item being ordered.  This manual oversight is absolutely required to prevent us from getting into a situation like you're describing.
We are **not** a way for people to order illegal items - we will in **no way** allow the order of any item which is illegal where we order it, receive it, and ship it to.
@_date: 2013-03-11 16:33:08


No... Thank YOU!
@_date: 2013-03-04 12:50:37
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-03-13 04:16:46
We're Flattered :)
@_date: 2013-03-06 15:19:07
Please email me personally(PM us here if you want), I would like to offer you our services free of charge - because, well... you're awesome!
(it didn't hurt that you gave us our very first "tip" on Reddit!)
@_date: 2013-03-05 20:05:34
we're working hard to make sure we fix those responsive site issues on mobile devices!
@_date: 2013-03-11 19:48:22
We just call it dedication :)
@_date: 2013-03-08 05:19:07
You've just hit on a few points we plan on addressing very shortly as we grow as a company.  If I were you, I'd stay tuned for the next couple weeks/months and I think you'll find what your looking for :)
@_date: 2013-03-08 13:17:30
Well what'da know... You're our favorite person on Reddit who has said we are their favorite Bitcoin company yet! 
@_date: 2013-03-05 04:28:52
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-03-08 18:31:43
We will be publishing the address on the site once we are moved in :)
Give us a week or two, and we will have an open door policy at our main office...just not the office where we store BTC and data - those are off-limits-super-secrect-air-force-one-ninja-buiscuit-style-bunkers :)
@_date: 2013-03-11 09:41:35
Thanks for the catch, if you decide to use Bitspend let us know its you in the order notes and your fees will magically disappear!
(PM us after you order so we know it was you)
@_date: 2013-03-08 06:46:51
We will ship you anything legal :)
We want to go ahead and offer you our service for free for your first order with us.  Just us send us a PM letting us know where you're emailing us from and contact support
 This way, you can get started on ordering your desired products, and test out Bitspend internationally :) 
We look forward to serving you and anyone else, anywhere in the world in the future.
@_date: 2013-03-13 13:17:00
You deserved it.  No one forced you to check for those pesky little bugs, but you did anyways.
We wanted you to know we appreciated your effort, help, and all around kick-assness!
@_date: 2013-03-11 14:01:14
Hahaha!  I will let the team know you're satisfied with their response time!
@_date: 2013-03-04 16:25:31
we'll be waiting :)

We're asking all new employees to temporarily work out of one of the stalls in the mens room.  However, bonus perk is that you can reserve your stall, and we will even put a "do not disturb" sing on your stall during office hours, so no one pees on your desk.
@_date: 2013-03-04 09:30:33
send an email to justin he'd be happy to talk to you about it :)
@_date: 2013-03-05 06:33:24
love your username!
@_date: 2013-03-13 11:56:21
Ok, there was no way we had this many mistakes!  Turns out, we uploaded an older version of the file and the new one is being uploaded now--which shouldnt have those issues.
We love Reddit, because of people like you!
@_date: 2013-03-04 06:33:33
If you happen to be in South FL, send us an email - we are moving into a new office in a few weeks and I think we will have a couple empty desks :)
@_date: 2013-03-04 10:21:13
We hope so.  We hope to have a dozen new jobs open directly because of this, within the next 18 months.  
@_date: 2013-03-05 23:45:30
We do plan on allowing our people to choose a percentage of their pay to come in BTC :)
@_date: 2013-03-12 21:19:24
As Buckeye_Tree mentioned, we absolutely do!  If you have any questions, please dont hesitate to contact us by PM here or email support
@_date: 2013-03-04 07:16:35
Im going to refrain from commenting about you getting under a desk... proving once and for all, sexual harassment cases are avoidable.
@_date: 2013-03-11 12:48:06
sure, why not!
We meant EST - but since we didnt clarify, its your win and our loss :)
@_date: 2013-03-12 21:16:51
We do not have a price limit, and will be clearing that up on the new site!
You can order anything, including the new Nexus!!
@_date: 2013-03-04 18:47:45
Thank you for that!  We just read through it and found it very interesting, and will probably post at a certain time based just on that!
We love you guys for all the support, comments, and suggestions so far!
@_date: 2013-03-13 06:54:20
we see what you did there..
@_date: 2013-03-11 16:36:49
Shipping is whatever the retailer is charging - we only charge for shipping on the orders who use our Anonymity Package, where we have the order shipped to us first.
If you order a standard order, regular shipping applies and is whatever the website you send us to is charging.
(for instance, most Amazon orders get Free shipping - but not your smaller retailers)
@_date: 2013-03-04 18:37:27
we're adding a BTC calculator to the site and browser extensions in the near future :)
@_date: 2013-03-11 23:50:34
As long as there is a separate shipping and billing address, and as long as the items are legal - we can order it for you!
@_date: 2013-03-11 21:19:15
If it is a legal purchase in the state you are having it shipped to - then it is no different than you ordering it yourself.  There is nothing illegal about a **legal** firearm :)
Things like this are tricky though, but we will work with you in the background to do everything we can to accommodate your needs.  As long as we won't end up in prison, we don't care what you order!
@_date: 2013-03-04 10:19:00


"Do or do not.  There is no ~~try~~ think."
@_date: 2013-03-11 19:50:34
While it will make it easier for us, it will actually improve the customer experience on a much larger scale :)
@_date: 2013-03-04 16:16:35
Since we're in the market for a in-house developer (by in house, we just mean always available - doesnt have to be physically in house), that may be close enough.  Have them contact justin as he is the one who your friend will need to talk to :)
@_date: 2013-03-13 14:20:57


We've found the problem, the cause of all the issues... we forgot to sleep!
(issue fixed)
@_date: 2013-03-08 11:30:28
It will be more than stated.  We will under no circumstance order anything prohibited in either the place it is being shipped OR for illegal for us to order.
We are not in any way a place for people to order illegal/prohibited materials - but instead a place for people to a) buy anything online with Bitcoins and b) should you choose to, order anythinglegal, online 100% anonymously. 
@_date: 2013-03-13 11:14:22


We just launched our new site, so I FTFY :)
@_date: 2013-03-11 16:34:33
We'll be seeing you soon I suspect :)
@_date: 2013-03-04 11:19:48
Are you Prince Nihasmihamadad?  We're still waiting on you to deposit that money to our account after we sent you our banking info!
On a side note, we will work with you on this and in-turn it will allow us a chance to build a process for this exact thing, in exchange we would do it for no fee - this way we help you, and you help us get better at helping people like you!
@_date: 2013-03-13 16:31:12
We thought it was a nice touch as well, and **yes** they are our actual baby pictures-not placeholder images :)
@_date: 2013-03-11 23:39:30
As I was speed-reading your comment, I read "your responses make me want to *cry*"
At first I didn't know what we did wrong!  
As a casual user, let us know if you ever need anything and we will make sure to take care of you in any way we can help(even if its not to actually use our service!).
@_date: 2013-03-06 13:57:53
**This is an awesome thing to wake up to**!
We are still not used to seeing our company name show up all over the internet, it is an amazing feeling to know how much we have already accomplished in just a short time!
We look forward to helping all of you purchase anything online, with Bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-03-11 23:37:44
Absolutely, we can handle orders up to and beyond those items.  Feel free to send orders an email if you would like to discuss a specific item for order :)
@_date: 2013-03-12 00:01:55
Anything we order from Amazon always receives Prime prices and shipping.
@_date: 2013-03-12 15:05:49
We promise to play nice with the other bookmarks!
@_date: 2013-03-13 16:32:54


It is our official policy going forward, that we always had it right and it was in fact you who were misreading :)
@_date: 2013-03-08 01:08:04
@_date: 2013-03-04 10:54:48
I saw it :)
No one is awake to process orders right now (they need sleep too ya know!), but I have made note of your order request, and will have it reviewed for an exception to our temporary $100 limit.
Thank you for your trust and business!
@_date: 2013-03-11 16:26:48
@_date: 2013-03-14 18:53:52
Great!  We look forward to it :)
@_date: 2013-03-11 20:07:35
Yep :)
@_date: 2013-03-04 16:56:58
Free candy.
@_date: 2013-03-11 15:56:26
We will **always** give the best price available, if there is a discount we pass it on to you!
@_date: 2013-03-05 20:04:31
Yes, yes, yes, and yes :)
@_date: 2013-03-30 14:24:13
Happily there are dozens of other reviews of our service all over the place already, as for some reason even though we love people posting reviews... this one has had more people questions its legitimacy than anything.
@_date: 2013-03-13 11:22:39
Seems our servers are being overloaded with traffic and we're seeing issues like you.  Hopefully we get this resolved ASAP!
[edit] Problem Solved!

We're planning on it - but we wanted to use the community to begin our growth.  We don't want to take on too much at once, and end up disappointing people.
We realize this thing is going to get big, pretty fast(that's why we did it!), but we also want to manage the growth at first, responsibly - to build a stable and trustworthy business for the long-run.
@_date: 2013-03-09 20:13:07
It is a few, yes lol. In the meantime - know that I **do** have answers to each of your questions and will gladly share them with you when I have more than 30 seconds :)
@_date: 2013-03-11 23:56:31
We do, for now you can add multiple URLs in the "notes/addition URLs" box at the end - but when the new form is live, it will have a + button to add more URL fields :)
@_date: 2013-03-11 23:41:58
No problem!  Just email us when you're thinking about ordering and we will do our necessary due diligence to ensure that we are following all laws when placing your order.
