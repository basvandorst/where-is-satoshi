My funds remains in processing and tickets are silent. Where else did you complained?

I have the same issue with them. Not 6 days, but whole day already and still in processing.
Meanwhile during withdrawal I've received an error saying "Could not connect to stage 2 server". But after refreshing the page funds has been reserved for withdrawal. 
Probably a software error? I'll wait a bit more before contacting support.

I cannot get, you can withdraw funds or they just got locked with/without error? 
And have you got any respond from support via Phone/mail/ticketing system? 
I haven't got any movement on my funds/tickets. They are still locked and tickets are unanswered.

But what did you do to unlock your funds?

You will probably not face issue with the limit, but you will definitely face it with lack of support, in case of need.
Such case indicates that site is going to die soon if no changes will be made.
Previously, when I used MtGox support was excellent.

There is no manual review or anything. You just have to do 2-3-4 operations to withdraw and pay a fee each time. The fee is the only thing, which comes on my mind about this reason.
For person willing to steal coins it will not be an issue, since you can click "Withdraw" multiple times in a second without any time limitation. 
So it is definitely not a fraud protection.

Created a support ticket in order to get, if my order is submitted correctly. Will see what happens. 
Completely agree that such issues should be addressed ASAP. 6 days ... well, I do not want to wait for that term. 
Probably they have ran out of Bitcoinson their account?
