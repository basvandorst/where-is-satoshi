I'm sure they'd also like to thank you for buying above 100$

hi, I am the person in question. just wanted a little advice on what to do with my earnings (and future earnings) -
**my original post**
*I've been investing in bitcoin over the years but I made a major purchase in 2015 when bitcoin was at its yearly low. Now it's skyrocketing and I'm going to be dealing with millions that I've never had before. What are some first steps anyone can recommend to me so that I can save and generate passive income and not blow it all on having some fun? I do want to buy some things but also be somewhat conservative and smart about it all.*
I was then muted because I asked why they deleted my post.
*My post deleted instantly? Why?*

"it's come to my attention that you do not accept 'large windfall' stories so you delete them before they are reviewed or before asking the poster to provide evidence, if you really want it. looking through the threads on the sub it all looks to be help for middle class average income folks with the top thread being an inspirational anecdote on why you should keep an emergency fund. I guess anyone who wants real help just because they made a large amount of money is automatically excluded from your conversations because we're now perceived as having silver spoons in our mouths and we're not a member of the common herd anymore? sad.. I was making $15/hr six years ago and worked hard for everything just like everyone else on here. really shitty moderating policy imo"
this lead me to retaliate to their abusive manner in the way that I did. I got upset as anyone would

what are you talking about? 69% interest on USD deposits?? Where is that in the fee schedule?
