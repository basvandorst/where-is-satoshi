The arguments presented concern the direction of the Tor project. The same arguments can apply to Bitcoin and can truly change the direction of Bitcoin itself because Bitcoin's future is not set in stone. The things most Bitcoiners seem to think about Bitcoin are not nearly as inevitable as they think they are. This is vastly more relevant to Bitcoin than 99% of the memes and news articles in this subreddit.

I was there (on IRC and the forums watching it unfold).
As far as we understand it, Gox's password hash table of users was on a 3rd-party auditor's computer which was hacked. After several days this list was posted very publicly and people started cracking password hashes; the 'simple' passwords are always easiest to crack. One or more attackers used these accounts and logged into MtGox and tried to withdraw bitcoins but there was a hardcoded $1000 withdraw limit of bitcoins. Naturally, if the exchange value of bitcoin is lower then you can withdraw more of them before you hit the limit. So the attacker(s) put in sell orders at $0.01 thus crashing the price down to $0.01. They then withdrew some bitcoins; MtGox stated that it was only several thousand dollars worth which is plausible since it would have been very difficult for the attacker(s) to actually use the site quickly at that time because everyone and their mom was logging in; it was basically unresponsive. The price went from $31 to $.01 (very very briefly) and then back to $17. After an hour or two the site was responding.
Then there was the media. It felt exactly like it does today: "Bitcoin is dead" "The rise and fall of Bitcoin", etc.
The price very slowly dropped for several months, bottoming out at $2 as people acquiesced. Those that remained after those several months were considered the genuine bitcoiners; the culture of the forum and subreddit even improved as those who were greedy were shaken out. That's when a lot of innovation happened. I'm sure if the price drops more and shakes out more of the greedy types then we'll see another surge of innovation in a bunch of months.

I suspect he means that if you are connected to lots and lots and lots of bitcoin nodes then you would need a reasonably fast Internet connection and a good router to support it. It would be advantageous to be connected to many bitcoin nodes because then you are almost guaranteed to be among the first 1% of bitcoin nodes to learn of the transaction.

TextSecure is centralized but Bitmessage is decentralized. It's incredibly easy to add all sorts of great features when a client just talks to a server. So far no one has proposed a way to add perfect-forward-secrecy to Bitmessage.

One thing to be optimistic about is that if an individual can abandon a payment processor and switch to a different one in 20 minutes, there will be more competition among payment processors. Currently, signing up for a PayPal-like service takes several days before the account is usable (transferring dollars being the slow part). So if a store wants me to use Acme Processor and I don't already have an Acme processor account, even if I see that Acme processor might be better, I'm still much more likely to abandon my purchase than sign up and complete my purchase 4 days and 10 steps later. Within Bitcoin, I can get a working Acme Processor account in 20 minutes with fewer steps. This would make everyone more willing to use better payment processors. 
So that's not nothing.

But that's not a useful way of measuring the value of our Bitcoin money. The value of a coin is the value of all the coins divided by the number of coins which people believe themselves to have (the money supply). 
What you stated is also not particularly relevant to the discussion which is "where is this $35 coming from?". The value isn't simply being created the way your statement implies; it is that our coins are being devalued slightly and that value is being distributed to the miners.

"Dear Mr. ******:
Thank you for your message.
I am happy to assist you. We are working on changing the password criteria to allow for longer passwords, as well as the use of special characters. I was unable to get a completion date for the changes. In the mean time, Schwab offers an additional layer of security using token authentication for electronic products, such as the Schwab Web site (
A Schwab Security Token displays a randomly generated 6-digit passcode that is used in combination with your regular web password.  This extra layer of online security may be desirable if you are a frequent traveler or prefer the extra measure of protection for your account information.  For more details on this service, see the SchwabSafe link at the very bottom of your Schwab.com page.  Select the "How you can prevent unauthorized account access" link in the center, then scroll down to find the Security Token information.
To order a token at no charge, you can call Technical Support at 1-800-433-9196.  Or call our 24 hour line at 1-800-435-4000. 
Please note: Once you begin using a Security Token, you will need to use the device for every log in.  If you need access without the device, you may call Technical Support at the above number to ask for a temporary passcode.  Token authentication applies only to an individual login, so each account holder will need to make a separate request in order to set up Security Token use.
Also, Schwab offers a Security Guarantee. This is our promise to cover 100% of any losses in your Schwab accounts due to unauthorized activity. Details about the guarantee are available at  Protection of our clients' security has always been a top priority of ours, and it has always been our practice to make clients whole in cases of unauthorized account activity. Schwab's Security Guarantee is our commitment to protecting the privacy and security of your accounts.

That's a non-sequitur. The supply of neither bitcoin nor alt-coin *transactions* is limited to the point where it affects cost at all. The marginal cost of many types of services actually goes *down* the more people use it. So for a third time, it isn't a normal market phenomenon for two extremely unequal value-transfer-mechanisms to have the same cost.
I'm glad that you are arguing with coinlock if he believes that side chains shouldn't be worked for the stated reason because his reason is weak. But I'm not going to argue with you any more myself because you are just wrong a lot.

Perhaps you do not know what Willy was.
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:29:19
Okay. I back away from trying to assert what he meant or didn't mean since it's not exactly clear to me. However it is true that the price of a SC-coin is arbitrarily set by the creator (relative to BTC) and that that is bad because it removes the price-discovery mechanism for the SC-coin. 
HOWEVER as you pointed out, if demand for SC-coin goes down then the supply will dwindle. This, actually, seems like it might be an excellent metric to judge the faith and value of a SC-coin. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:18:15
I did get the joke but it wasn't clear that he did. The fact that he wrote the phrase the normal way indicated that perhaps he didn't. My comment was meant to start a humorous argument. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:05:15










He's talking about fees there. He probably should have avoided that.


I see the source of the confusion. said that the devs can set the value of their coins arbitrarily when *starting* the sidechain. However the price doesn't float and adjust to changes in real value. Your statement that "The price of a SC-coin is determined 100% by the market" is wrong because the SC-coin is pegged to bitcoins despite having a different real value.
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:18:51

Trying to sell your sock for a BTC is not normal and it doesn't create a functional market. So no, it isn't a normal market phenomenon for two extremely unequal value-transfer-mechanisms to have the same cost. 


I don't have a problem with you having the option. I'm just pointing out something that will be a problem for some people.
@_date: 2015-01-11 19:42:07
It isn't a normal market phenomenon for two extremely unequal value-transfer-mechanisms to have the same cost. It isn't a normal market phenomenon, relative to existing alt-coins, for the cost of the token to remain the same even if the security of the network dramatically changes. isn't misleading anyone- he is stating a truth. He isn't saying that BTC and BTC-backed SC-coins will have different ~~values~~prices- in fact, he saying that they will have *equal* ~~values~~prices and that that is precisely the problem.
EDIT: changed 'values' to 'prices'.
@_date: 2015-01-11 19:50:32

I personally don't understand the rationale that Chinese miners would want or need to keep the block size low because of a slow Internet connection. Transaction verification could be done nearby in a country with fast Internet, like South Korea, Japan, India, or Russia and then the block header could be sent to China every 20 seconds or whenever a different miner finds a block. Then after solving, the nonce can be sent back out, put on the block, and broadcast. Technically, doing this might be beneficial even with 1MB blocks because they might be able to get their block out to the world faster- if they lack bandwidth in China then uploading just a nonce to India and uploading the whole block from there could be faster. 
One might say, "Well what about getting the full block *into* China so that it can be mined by other Chinese miners?" It appears to me that logical miners in China should already be mining after receiving only a valid block header and then aborting mining on that block if a transaction in the block is found to be invalid. Which means that they only need the header fast. So it doesn't matter if block data must be streamed into the country slowly from India as long as it can be streamed in and verified in less than 10 minutes. Also, if the other miners are also doing block verification in another country then this whole paragraph is moot and my first paragraph will work perfectly.
**TL;DR** Chinese miners could use this trick to mine extremely large blocks even with a very slow Internet connection.
So am I wrong? Am I confused? Why can't Chinese miners just do this?

1) **Yes**, it is always possible even if the person is trying to hide behind an anonymizing service like Tor or a VPN because the traffic pattern would give it away. 
2) **Yes**, lots of heat. The more miners you have the more heat is created and the more power is used.
3) **No**, the number of mining machines you have doesn't affect how much Internet bandwidth is used. A teenager with one mining device uses as just much bandwidth as the huge server farms in China. Watching 1080p HD videos on YouTube uses around **15 times more bandwidth than Bitcoin mining.** And that's even when your mining operation looks like [this](
The electricity used by Bitcoin mining is high so that could be a plot device- the power used in the house/company/organization would rise dramatically. If the mining operation is relatively large (like bedrooms or a basement full of computers) then it could start a fire on the wire leading the telephone pole or it could happen in the building like in some sort of circuit breaker box for example. That would be great TV.

That would work. But surely the exchange rate on BTCGreece won't stay rational very long. As long as people can get BTC but not fiat out of Greece then the exchange rate will be high. Large arbitrage opportunities will exist for anyone who can get euros out of Greece. Alternatively one could sell BTC on BTCGreece, do nothing with the euros for the time being and then hedge to cover rises in the normal *fair-market* BTC exchange rate. After capital controls are lifted, you would be able to unwind all of this and walk away with a profit. One thing to worry about though, is whether a potential euro haircut might apply also to BTCGreece accounts.

Concerning messages to self, I replied to what might be your question on the Bitmessage forum but for the sake of curious Redditors, I'll post it here as well:
You are having trouble sending messages to yourself because the program is not processing its own public key requests. It sees that it already has the request (because it sent it), it figures that it already responded to it, so it ignores the request.
I can't think of an acceptable work-around. The getpubkey message must be stored in inventory so that it knows that it already processed it and to share it with peers. Bitmessage cannot act noticeably different when the public key belongs to self because that would introduce an attack vector.

I suppose that it would guarantee that you are mining on the correct (longer-chain) side of the Atlantic.

if you start mining today in order to help secure the network, some other individual will be forced off by economics. Increased mining will follow a higher price. So there are two things we can do:
* Encourage technology that hashes faster for less money (like ASICs) assuming that the attacker can't acquire a huge portion of the new technology.
* Find ways to encourage the use of Bitcoin which will, in turn, lead to a higher price. 
When the price of a bitcoin doubles, the cost of implementing a 51% attack doubles.

Your computer will very infrequently do reads from the block chain file but rather will simply write to the end of it every ten minutes. Thus fragmentation of this file is not something to worry about. It could at least be potentially important to have blkindex.dat defragmented because Bitcoin has to do lookups and writes to this file for every global Bitcoin transaction. Luckily it doesn't appear to be very fragmented from the looks of your screenshot.

Well let us continue the 3 bitcoin example from above. When we agree that you owe me 3 bitcoins, I don't actually have any real bitcoins to spend. The usefulness in the system is this: suppose I work at a used sporting-goods store which also uses Ripple. You go there and sell a baseball for three bitcoins. The sporting goods store and I already have a trusting relationship because I work there. The sporting goods store can just owe me 3 bitcoins, and I will write-off the amount of money you owe me. The software would track all of this automatically and, as you can see, we didn't have to bother exchanging actual bitcoins or dollars.
There aren't Ripple dollars or Ripple bitcoins which have value that can fluctuate. If you tell a million people that you owe them a million dollars, then you simply owe them all a million dollars.

It appears as though as more people use Ripple(denominated in bitcoins), the lower the demand for money will be. If everyone uses Ripple, then almost no one would need to use the Bitcoin blockchain: there would only be an occasional "re-balance" where an unskilled/unlucky person sends a large sum to a talented/skilled/lucky(rich) person and all of the Ripple balances in-between would go to zero. Ripple could keep the value of bitcoins from skyrocketing (and plummeting) if/when Bitcoin goes mainstream.

Bitcoin only needs mining rewards to make a 51% attack expensive and to incentivise an individual to be honest and mine for the reward rather than because fraud is more lucrative.

Possible solutions involve temporary centralization. It wouldn't be a 'beautiful' solution, but it would work and the millions the attacker would spend on the attack would be in vain. 
Just from spending two minutes thinking about better solutions I've come up with this: Miners could form a web of trust and individual blocks could be given a trust rating. Any blocks that aren't sufficiently trusted by you could be ignored. Most miners would ignore them also. The "longest" chain will temporally be defined as being a combination of the most difficult proof-of-work and the trust rating. This solution would be distributed, but more complicated. 
In any case, the fact that I just came up with a possible solution in two minutes makes me confident that there are even better solutions available if we ever need them. And that fact alone should be a deterrent to keep people from spending millions to try.

You clearly misunderstand Fractional Reserve Banking. [Here is the example on Wikipedia on the Fractional Reserve Banking page.]( You can see that Bank A gets 100 deposited then lends out 80. It lent out beyond its reserves. It doesn't have enough to cover everyone's withdrawals all at the same time. This is just how Fractional Reserve Lending works. Your assumption that banks can not lend out beyond what they have on reserve is where you are going wrong.

No one is going to stay on the old chain and wage a war if there was a reason to switch to a new hashing algorithm in the first place. But you presuppose that some miners would stay on the old chain because of their existing hardware- that's fine- merchants and users don't care. The merchants and users upgrade to the new algorithm and whoever wants to mine at a huge profit over on the new chain is welcome to join them. Any miner with the hardware to have a 'war' against the new chain wouldn't; they would make a ton of money mining honestly. The stubborn miners with the obsolete hardware can continue mining on the old chain and both chains can continue on happily. (The obsolete miners obviously won't be happy- I was describing the blockchain).

People in product &amp; software development know that [most all] people don't read manuals. So none exist. Obviously if the number of Bitcoin users is growing then the number of people who want a manual will rise to a significant number and they will see one created for them. It wouldn't need to be very long. Here are the sections I'm imagining:
1. Introduction (what Bitcoin is)
2. How it works (no deep technical details)
3. Installing the Bitcoin-Qt client. 
4. Sending bitcoins
5. Receiving bitcoins
6. Backing up your Bitcoin wallet
7. Pitfalls (Viruses, scams)
The manual would be obsolete a year from now since m-of-n transactions which use your phone or some other device to confirm your actions may be a big part of Bitcoin by then. Also the days-long blockchain download may go to *instant*.

Pay To Script Hash:
The output of a transaction you make is actually a script. The script is program code and some hashes. This takes up space and reveals a little amount of information. It also isn't particularly forward compatible because if you want to use a crazy script, like an M of N transaction, today's Bitcoin client will ignore it and drop it. That sucks. What if you could just pay to a hash value? Then you could use any crazy script you want and the public as a whole would only have to store a small(er) amount of information, potentially *much* smaller. There are secondary advantages, for example: because the transaction is small, the sender only has to pay a small fee even if the receiver of the funds wants a big huge crazy transaction; the receiver will (eventually) have to pay the fee to get the big transaction data included in the blockchain which is much more fair.
Pay To Script Hash is the great idea Satoshi didn't have himself. It's the way it always should have been.

Bitcoin will not behave the same way under fractional reserve banking that dollars do. We can see from history that an occasional bitcoin bank would fail. That is the cost we pay for not having the value of the currency fail (drop). It's one or the other- with dollars, the dollars drop (in value). With Bitcoin, the banks drop (into bankruptcy). I'm okay with that.

Here is mine, in the form of directions for Windows users:
* Download and install Truecrypt. 
* Using Truecrypt, create a 4GB volume with a strong password that you memorize. Put this 4GB volume on your C drive anywhere. 
* Mount the 4GB drive so that you can access it with a drive letter like T:
* Make a copy of your Bitcoin shortcut and change it so that it points to "C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe" -datadir=T:\Bitcoin
* Double click on the shortcut. It should start downloading the blockchain to the T:\Bitcoin directory and will put a new wallet there. 
* Spend your bitcoins to an address in this wallet after you are comfortable with this process.
* When the blockchain is caught up, close Bitcoin, wait for it to close completely, then dismount the T drive. Whenever you want to spend Bitcoins, you will mount this T drive first.
* Make a backup copy of your C drive and store it offsite, like at work, *just like you should be doing anyway.*
Thus your wallet is encrypted, backed up, off site, and doesn't rely on any third parties. 
Optional: Download a fun Bitcoin app to your smart phone and put some bitcoins on it. With BitcoinSpinner, you can save your Private key as a backup. Take a picture and put the picture in your encrypted T drive. This way if you lose or destroy your phone, you can recover your bitcoins!

That's a good question. The good blockchain would overtake the bad blockchain after 51% of people switch to it. The bad blockchain would then die. Technically you will necessarily spend your bitcoins on both. The last (and only) time this happened before, the good chain overtook the bad chain in only 53 blocks. Most normal users probably didn't even notice. It was recommended that they upgrade (to help the network), but wasn't absolutely necessary. The only possible collateral damage could be to businesses who are slow to upgrade who are deliberately taken-advantage-of by an individual during that 50 block window. One would have to be a pretty good programmer to do so.

I remember reading that the public key, or something special, can be extracted from the signed message.

Can someone remind me: What can be extracted from what?
@_date: 2012-10-04 19:14:12
Yes, *now*. Not on day one. Which makes the theorem wrong.. Unless we say that the coins actually did have "value" on day one (like hugolp is saying) the way test-net coins have "value" today. But at that point the word "value" is almost meaningless because everything has value. Why would we need this theorem then? We could just say, "Anything can be money because anything has value and can be traded." And that's it. Thus Mises regression theory of money is either wrong or useless.

Well if it is exchanged at a flat rate and doesn't float against the dollar, then what is the point? The currency cannot fulfill its supposed primary purpose. 
Also, if it was to continue, how could the venture have possibly stayed viable if there was a loss of confidence in the coins if everyone realized they weren't worth very much? He wouldn't have been able to exchange Everyone's money because he surly would have spent a lot on overhead and on producing the coins themselves.

@_date: 2012-12-01 07:49:47
What would the purpose of the blockchain be? We would still need the individual POW system to prevent blockchain bloat. The blockchain could also be easily 51%-attacked by anyone. Imagine if the bitcoin block reward was only .1 bitcoins per block but bitcoins are still worth $12. How much mining would there be right now? 500 times less which isn't enough. I would bet that Satoshi's line of though was first to think-up the blockchain and then to realize that he has to reward people for mining it - thus we have a block reward. A Bitmessage blockchain would be to easy to 51%-attack I'm afraid.

1. I can't think of how a bank could simultaneously provide instant transfers and also m-of-n transactions where you, the sender, could prevent the bank from lending the bitcoins to someone else. And if a bank doesn't have control of your bitcoins for their own purposes, I hardly see how they could be defined as a bank. They would be some sort of 'payment security' or 'payment confirmation' company. So if we agree on those definitions, which I think are fair, then there is nothing in the protocol to prevent Fractional Reserve Banking.
2. That said, FRB with bitcoins is risky because there is no lender of last resort. If banks don't have a high reserve ratio, they're in for trouble, and their customers are in for some pain. Customers will care *a lot* about what their bank's reserve ratio is, and if all banks have a reserve ratio of something like 50% or 75% (along with the fact that so many people won't put their money in banks) then there won't be very much FRB anyway so it isn't something to worry about. 
Math: Let's assume 10% of people put their money in banks and banks maintain a 60% reserve requirement. The money supply of bitcoins only grows to 22.34 million bitcoins. That's not a very big increase over 21 million. 
Bottom line: The fact that bitcoins can't be counterfeited by a central bank will keep FRB in check. 
 Consumer banking accounts will be relevant, just much less relevant. Using a bank account will, for the first time in many years, be truly *optional*.
@_date: 2012-01-30 03:01:03
When someone sends someone else bitcoins, they have to specify how the next person can spend them using a Bitcoin script. Bitcoin scripts have, so far, been rather short because the Bitcoin client doesn't do very much. But the protocol could do much much more advanced complicated things that would be very useful. One of those things is m-of-n transactions, but that is only one of a huge possibility of things! But then the scripts will get very long. Miners and clients will have to start storing potentially **much** more data. Do you have any spare hard drives lying around? Because you're going to need them.
But what if we store a hash of the script instead of the script itself!? This way we all would have much less data to store and the sender of the bitcoins wouldn't have to pay the high transaction fee just because the receiver is a complicated son-of-a-bitch. This would allow transactions that are not just 70 bytes long, but **hundreds** of bytes long to be 'sendable' using a QR code or the normal-length addresses we are used to. It is better for everybody! There is no reason not to! 
Even in the worst-case-scenario (a blockchain fork), we can get through it just by having 51% of people upgrade their Bitcoin client. All fixed! 
@_date: 2012-11-29 21:09:02
Unfortunately it would be both useful and easily attackable. It would be useful for storing old messages (let us say, for two months or some such value). It would be easily attackable because the global network hash rate would be low because there is no incentive to mine. I'm not sure why you would want to 51%-attack a message blockchain but I'm sure someone would think of some nefarious reason.

One person made one of these bets with tens of thousands of dollars-worth of bitcoins and earned a huge return in a matter of minutes. His actions both caused and allowed him to profit from the downturn. At this point, he had not yet closed all of his positions. He was still at risk. Then he made a big mistake: He bragged and put a screenshot on the Bitcoin Talk forum of what he was doing. This allowed other well financed individuals to know exactly how to screw him out of all of his money and make money themselves. Which happened. The guy lost all of his money when the price shot back up. He quickly went from being extremely jovial to being completely pissed off. The End!
This is publicly known because everyone was talking on the Bitcoin talk forum at the time.

I've recently come to the conclusion that the silly predictions of the 1700s and 1800s weren't wrong because *people* didn't know any better. They were wrong because neither the person making the prediction nor the people spreading the prediction were familiar enough with the subject matter to see that the prediction was silly. Finding people familiar with the subject matter to fact-check a prediction takes time and effort. There is also no reason to do so- making provocative predictions without regard for their accuracy brings notoriety and, today, clicks.

Increasing the money supply of Bitcoins by 80% overnight would inflate the value of each Bitcoin by a proportional amount. After everything settled down, the market value of all Bitcoins would be the same as before. 
You are proposing that the Miners simply become Banks. Anyone with Bitcoins can become a bank if they choose to. My MtGox Bitcoin balance is 20 Bitcoins. If MtGox wanted to loan those Bitcoins to someone else for a profit, they could as long as they keep some in reserve in case I (and others) want to withdraw our Bitcoins. It would be wise of them to maintain a very high reserve ratio in case there is a run on their bank.
Also, it should be noted that MtGox could end up lending out MORE than 20 Bitcoins using only the 20 in my account if the Bitcoins that they lend out end up coming back and are stored in someone else's account on MtGox. Those 20 real Bitcoins can grow to 200 in the money supply.

I heard that there was a transaction which had a huge number of CHECKSIGs which could be used to DoS hosts because the computational work required to do a CHECKSIG is very high. It is one of the reasons the Satoshi Client only relays standard transactions. This is probably that transaction.

I'm not sure if you're ever going to see this comment because it was a week ago, but just in case: You need to learn what Money Supply means. You are confusing it with Currency Supply. The currency supply of Bitcoins is limited to 21 million. The Money Supply limit is drastically higher and is a function of the currency supply and the minimum reserve amount.

MtGox *does* move around about that much money sometimes and we know for sure it is them. We don't have proof that *this* particular transaction is them, but it is reasonable to think it could be.

I think that it's likely that it, or possibly anything, could be done as a soft fork. To increase the number of coins, upgraded miners could refer to an external data structure at the top of each block just like they do with segwit. That data structure could be a second "additional" blockchain with 100 times as many bitcoins created in each block. These "extra" bitcoins, and also legacy coins, could be spent only on the additional chain. New clients would produce empty blocks on the legacy chain. Legacy clients wouldn't respect the extra bitcoins at all but would build off of whatever the longest chain is. Legacy clients in this scenario suffer from the same risk as they do under today's UASF proposal: that their transactions will get reorged out of existence. 
Miners might actually be on board with the whole thing because while 100 times as many coins will be created per unit time, the value per coin won't drop by 99% because of investor psychology. So the miners stand to make much more money. Once the soft fork chain grows longer than the legacy chain, the legacy chain would disappear and the remaining users would have no choice but to start using the new "fair-to-latecomers" Bitcoin software. Their bitcoins will be worth less, of course, but it's better than zero.
Thus you can see that a UASF can potentially be used for pretty much anything.

With the roof analogy if one person jumps it doesn't affect you. But in Bitcoin we always reach consensus eventually. Which means that we either all jump or all don't because we're all tied together. It used to be the case that 51% of users would have to jump off the roof for us all to go over. And that worked very well. No one fell off the roof. But now that can be thwarted using USAF- a minority of users might be able to pull over the majority. Sometimes that might be a good thing- perhaps we should jump because the building is on fire (i.e. perhaps miners are being bad). But it's likely that if BIP148 goes through and that chain wins, it will set a precedent and in the future other people will try to pull everyone off the next roof for nefarious reasons.
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:46:07
Sure, I just wanted to make it clear to others reading this thread that your earlier comment suggesting zero downtime is disingenuous. The chain would fork between users using UASF and those not aware of it and it would be a clusterfuck. 
You also earlier said that a hardfork requires everyone to upgrade to the latest code which is true. But a UASF requires everyone (except for miners) to upgrade also. Your assertion is that "I can keep running an old (non-mining) node after a UASF" is mistaken.

@_date: 2013-01-07 04:34:26
There is a good reason why we don't. Mike Hearn explains: 
"The fact that Bitcoin is different to other technologies isn't intuitive but by the time you're writing an actual implementation, it should be obvious. 
The fact is that re-implementing Bitcoin exposes not only you, but all participants, to a class of "chain splitting" bugs that don't really exist in other network technologies, or at least are nowhere near as severe. The browser wars of the 90s were bad, but at least developers could check which browser the user ran and adapt to it on the fly. The Bitcoin equivalent is dramatically worse.
When you reimplement Bitcoin, it's not enough to build things as you think they should work. You have to implement them exactly as Satoshi did, including all his bugs. And because some parts of the protocol are directly exposed to underlying libraries like OpenSSL, you have to match their behaviour exactly as well, including all their bugs. Failure to do so can lead to people losing money.
At some point, if you realize you have to match the behaviour of another codebase exactly, down to the tiniest detail, you realize that the only precise enough specification for that is the source code. Which means if you can't read C++ fluently you can't reimplement Bitcoin, yes, but who cares? If you can't keep up, don't step up.
Having detailed protocol documentation is something I'd agree with in any other project except this one. In this one, it will simply mislead people into thinking they can reimplement Bitcoin. Unless they are willing to make absolutely massive effort and take serious risks, they can't.
Bitcoin is not like other software projects. It just isn't. If you badly reimplement POP3 then, at worst, some mail clients don't talk to your server or vice-versa. The user swaps to a different client and goes about their day. Big deal. The POP3 spec doesn't need to have huge health warnings at the top of it.
If you badly reimplement Bitcoin then people can and will lose money. Possibly a lot of money. In the worst case, people who don't even use that software can lose money.
By "badly reimplement", I mean making such trivial mistakes as swapping out OpenSSL for a crypto library that follows the DER specs correctly and rejects signatures with negative numbers. OpenSSL doesn't do this, it silently makes them positive to fix the signature. Arguably, that's a bug in OpenSSL, but there it is. It's a part of Bitcoin now. If you don't match that mistake - chain splitting bug. Fortunately, that's one we discovered early through happy accident (somebody actually generated such transactions without realizing and got them into the chain). Now imagine if that hadn't happened until a reimplementation got popular.
How many other such inconsistencies might there be? Can you be sure you got them all? What kind of an audit do you need to find code that isn't wrong or incorrect, it's just different to what it should be?
I don't know of any other systems where such tiny deviations from the spec (in ways that are arguably "correct") can cause such damage. POP3 certainly doesn't count. Perhaps crypto libraries is getting close, in that apparently minor issues (like side channel timing attacks) can cause a total failure .... and so, most competent developers will tell you to not implement your own cryptography for this reason.
Yes, documenting Satoshis code exactly is both hard and theoretically possible. There is already documentation on the basic layout of the protocol messages, which is sufficient for many apps. For the rest, well, feel free to try but don't put your readers under any illusions. They will not be able to safely implement Bitcoin based on your documents - so why bother writing them?"
@_date: 2013-01-29 02:45:45
To me,
When the bitcoin price was rising it was nice, but between $12 and $30 it just felt completely irrational. So when it finally started going down, it felt like it was simply correcting back down to where it belonged. Despite this, I didn't sell because I thought that one big news story could rocket it up to $100 in just as irrational a fashion and I didn't want to have to buy back in after it went back down to $50. I now believe that a lot of people understood that it was in a huge bubble but people enjoy riding bubbles hoping to get out before everyone else because they think that they are smarter; people were doing the exact same thing with Pirate's pyramid scheme- most people knew it was a pyramid scheme but they were hoping to come out on top. 
One important thing to mention- the price wasn't in freefall- it really did take time to go down. It gave people enough time to wonder, to talk, to lament, to theorize and speculate. MtGox got hacked at 17 and following that, the fall from 17 to 2 was reasonably slow. I personally felt bad for the miners who had bought equipment to start mining with the assumption that the price would be higher. The MtGox hack was an especially exciting/scary day (much more than the drop from $30 was) because it happened without warning and people were already jittery. The IRC channel was blowing up and June 19th 2011 remains the busiest day on the bitcointalk forum *ever*. Imagine thousands of computer savvy nerds all scraping the Internet for every shred of information. They/We put the story together of what happened very very fast. I got (and still have) a copy of the leaked MtGox user database on which I found myself. 
I never sold any bitcoins; I bought some more after it was apparent that we had bounced off of $2. 
I only am now understanding how many people lost confidence in bitcoin itself after the exchange hacks. I thought only a tiny vocal minority would have been that stupid or ignorant but apparently it was common to simply not understand Bitcoin then.

And it will be a constant value, not a percent because it can be just as much work for the software to transfer .00005 bitcoins as 50000 bitcoins.
(more precisely, fees will be a function of transaction size and transactions will only be big if you are running a business and moving bitcoins all over the place)

There are algorithms that split a password up between people in interesting ways. For example, you can split a password up between 4 people such that if any three of them get together, then can reassemble the password. You could make a deterministic wallet based on the password which would also function as a brainwallet. I didn't see an open source implementation of the algorithm last time I looked but I suppose I should look again.

We, as a community, have to start this way. We all know that eventually it will be cheaper in bitcoins and they could start accepting 0-confirmation orders. But someone has to build the initial infrastructure and that costs some money.

Both are correct. By 2040 99.8% of all bitcoins will have been mined which, for a variety of practical purposes, is an "end". The fact that from 2040 to 2140 only 0.2% of the 21 million bitcoins will be mined is not particularly significant.

I feel that as long as use of the federated service is truly optional then it is sufficient to meet the project's goals. We need only consider the *reasons* we are avoiding centralization to see that some federation is acceptable. As far as I can tell, our ultimate goals are:
* to avoid high forced costs
* anonymity
* freedom to spend our money the way we want
* non-inflationary currency
Ultimately no one cares about centralization- they care about those underlying issues.

I'm a huge Bitcoin supporter and even I agree with that statement. Don't you? Wouldn't you have to admit that if the value of a bitcoin rose at a steady 3 or 7 percent per year that it would be at least slightly more useful? I think you would agree. Thus this question and Goolsbee's response will not go down in history the way Krugman's is being brought up because even if Bitcoin is wildly successful, Goolsbee will still be able to claim he is right- which he is. This is not a useful question to be asking on the survey.

We'll never be able to bump up the block size to support these adoption rates. I believe that Bitcoin will be (is) a great currency but not a good value transfer mechanism. We'll some need off-blockchain transfer mechanisms so that using the blockchain is optional. Old-ripple was this.

I will follow your line of questions. There is no difference between the two except that gold is naturally rare and random numbers aren't. But we can just say that there is no difference. What is the point of the theorem then?

It doesn't make sense because we are not and never were trading cryptographic algorithms. We are using cryptography to sign conceptual tokens to one another. Satoshi *literally literally* generated a random number and we all are collectively agreeing that that random number, and ones chaining off of it, have value but not the others. The value of bitcoins started from **nothing**. Trying to assert otherwise requires mental gymnastics.

An asset is in a state of "bubbled" if and only if the asset's value is in a position to drop significantly **because of a fundamental shift in investor understanding**. The drop today was not due to any change in investor understanding therefore today's drop alone is not evidence of a bubble.

So I presume it is not the same one used by most miners? Seeing as there are 10 or 20, do miners have different ones that they like? Do you use the same one as MtGox?

It would be nice if this page of double-spends actually showed what coins were double spent. This is just a list of transactions. There should be an arrow going from left to right which forks and points to two outputs, perhaps with a green check next to one output and a big red X next to the other. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:34:56
It certainly is a fundamental shift but it isn't a fundamental shift in understanding. Stocks change value because of changes to the environment all the time but it doesn't mean that they were bubbled. Observe that with the housing and .com bubbles, the loss of exchange value of the assets was primarily due to the fact that people became aware that the actual value of the assets was much lower than the exchange value.

Before I started working on Bitmessage, I talked to people about Satoshi's idea which specialenmity (and probably many others) have come up with also, and the reaction was universally negative- no one considered the implications, they all just stopped when I got to the part where I said that sending a message would cost a penny.
Then when you couple that with the fact that it would be centralized, I think it would be hard to get people to start using it. The marginal cost of dealing with spam is lower than the cost to figure out how to get money into the new system.

The point is that we are all *agreeing* to want it. We didn't want it because random numbers are rare- and that's the relevant point as it applies to the Regression Theorem. Random numbers are *not* rare. There are an infinite number of them and they can be copied an infinite number of times. We did not want it because it is rare, as is the case with gold, we simply all are agreeing to choose that one random number as our starting point (for the block chain).
Mises' Regression Theorem of money is false.

The river analogy is a bad analogy. The gold that you pan from the river is almost as valuable as the same amount of gold in a coin. It doesn't go from absolute zero to valuable just because you made a coin out of it; only fiat money has that property. 
Yes PGP does *provide value* indeed in the sense that it provides a service. So does ECC in Bitcoin's case. But we aren't trading that value- we are using the technology to make and trade bitcoins. I could start a billion trillion alt-chains using the same technology and it wouldn't make the alt-coins valuable by virtue of the technology having value. The technology is copyable. The technology is not what is being traded. **Don't get the value of the technology confused with the value of the bitcoins.**

I use Namecheap for several domains and like them a lot. Obviously I would give them bitcoins if they would take them. After the Godaddy/SOPA events of last year a lot of people switched to Namecheap so, as they seem to be anti-evil, they are most likely to be amenable to accepting bitcoins.
