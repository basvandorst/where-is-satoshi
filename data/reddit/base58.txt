if Coinbase can cripple your shit network it has already failed. so cute your solution is for a bunch of low test sissies like the OP pic to get together and complain about it lmao
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:58:05
you miss the point that your future scenario starts already assuming LN is widely adopted. you also seem to miss the point that miners aren't going to keep providing hash power to the crippled coin's network if there is no longer incentive for them to do so.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:17:01


they can pay miners whatever they want, thats part of the bitcoin protocol. you're all just mad your artificial block scarcity scam is getting derailed. lmao Coinbase rules.

i have a brilliant idea to solve this:
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:45:38
WOW THE FUTURE OF MONEY!!
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:05:02
zero science. zero math. zero proofs. admitting on-chain tx are still required to fund LN hotwallets. admitting "massively connected" central hubs will dominate the landscape. wew. thanks for the laugh. i hope AXA set you scumbags up real nice to rape bitcoin like this.

the original bitcoin had 32mb blocks segshit is an imposter shitcoin funded by AXA

a decade-long transaction is a small price to pay for censorship resistance 
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:59:43
show me the part where you can magically broadcast a tx onto the blockchain without paying the mining fee that the twitter shills keep talking about. lololololololololololololololololololololololol
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:58:16
lol these videos successfully predicted a hard-fork and also make it perfectly clear that the blocksize can be scaled much further than 2mb without problem. you mods better censor Princeton!
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:45:13


it does me no good trying to argue here. they turned their back not only on early devs and businesses but Satoshi himself. if they wouldn't let Mike Hearn talk what chance do I have? i encourage you to do some independent research into the matter so you can make up your own mind on the subject.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:20:57
yes yes everyone that agrees with OP is a sockpuppet. also lol @ using age of account as some metric of authenticity. you have no problem shoving satoshi and the original scaling plan in the garbage but ohhhhhhhhh wow look how old this reddit account is!!! it must be reliable!!! 
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:04:17
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:16:19
you still haven't said anything of substance about the fact that nick's views are diametrically opposed to satoshis. "hurrr coffee" "hurr to the mewn". you don't have an argument and you don't have a use case.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:48:07
this is NOT a shill or troll post. really is a controlled echo chamber. gfy everybody.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:07:46
not an argument 
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:43:53
the denial is strong. gotta keep the ponzi going amirite
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:52:48
no blocks, only tabs
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:20:57
if you are capable from separating from your biases, go do your own independent research on the lightning network.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:19:16
LMAO. if this charlatan is the real satoshi then why was he dumb enough to push for miners as full nodes and SPV nodes as a 0-conf service instead of going straight to the IOU network? there was no groundbreaking scientific revelation in 2014 that suddenly made the original plans obsolete. so why would "satoshi" waste his time pushing that solution if he believed in a hub and spoke IOU economy all along? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:37:30
im sure i'll be booted from here soon anyways. theymos and the core devs won't stand idly by and allow and actual debate to take place.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:27:11
awww mad i interrupted the stupid childish little roller coasters? lmao i was here back when this place was an echo chamber of "take that paypal! bitcoin is coming for you!" and "lets pester this business with thousands of complaints until they start accepting btc!!"
and now your tiny little peasant brains have been conditioned into circle jerking about muh store of value rai stones instead. lmao. what are you doing here kid? i already know the answer: hoping to get rich (ie high USD value) by buying and sitting on an "investment". geee why do outsiders think bitcoin is a ponzi again? i can't imagine why they would....crazy
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:43:15


lawl. stay here with your buddies and circlejerk about your gift card network
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:50:18


hence the SPV. core hates Satoshi and the early pre-blockstream roadmap. nobody in here has provided any real concrete reason why the entire concept of bitcoin was thrown in the garbage and reworked into this mess. too blinded by the USD price tag. good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:28:37
lol wow nice rebuttal. keep ignoring 0conf SPV and the entire purpose of miners existence. its cute that you think nick would have spent years going down that route only to do a 180 and accuse his former colleagues of being out to get him. LMAO. better stick to posting roller coaster gifs
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:31:06


yeah ok, you're obviously a shill. lightning network IS the legacy payment system.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:25:19
tabs and private hubs aren't cypherpunk. good luck with your digital fool's gold though.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:43:22
my point is that you are a get-rich-quick chump and wont be around for the long haul. go jack off to that gay little smiling roller coaster gif you loser
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:43:58
not a single real answer just le downboats so you can get back to your circle jerking. nick's opinions are totally contradictory to satoshi's posts but since none of you have actually read anything on bitcoin you wouldn't know that. downvote away since you sure as hell don't have a real response. CHARLATAN CHARLATAN CHARLATAN CHARLATAN 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:52:28
"hurr durr large mining pools are all groupthink anti-bitcoiners, now let me tell you about this revolutionary new technology that uses the spoke and hub IOU model with digital rai stones as its base unit....its gonna be sooooo revolutionary!!" 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:02:12
age of reddit account is NOT proof of bitcoin background. you guys sure do rely on strawmans alot over here. 


its like you don't even WANT to know what SPV is.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:52:17
wow what a hitpiece. Lightning isn't compatible with OB, deal with it.
