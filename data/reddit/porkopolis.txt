Thanks for the heads up.

Agreed. They've been pretty reliable up until now. An outage like this requires better communication.

This deserves gold. Well done :)

Is it time to panic yet?

I wish I could upvote this more than once but you didn’t include the dad shoes!

That’s fantastic!

It's not just you. I felt the same way. I find myself checking prices at all hours!

This is called Civil Forfeiture. It's becoming a more common practice by police and turns upside down the premise of innocent until proven guilty. You are automatically assumed guilty and it's up to the individual to prove they're innocence. The OP is fucked. I wish you the best getting your property back. 
John Oliver did a great piece on this if you're interested

Gemini is legit.

Had the same thing happen. Decided to try another wallet.

In the U.S. I think Coinbase is it. Beware fees are higher than other exchanges and their website is frequently down at peak times (when you might want to buy or sell).

I was verified for Tier 1 about a month ago and have been waiting for Tier 2 ever since. I gave up and signed up with Gemini. The verification process took less than a week. Besides I've been reading a lot of people who use Kraken who are having problems. Maybe it was a blessing in disguise.

Heard good things about Exodus. Moved my coins without issue. I really like the interface. Only downside is it doesn't have an iOS or Android app (yet).
