Cool, I see my transaction through that link! But it has been over 24 hours of syncing. Updated from 0.8.2 (I assume) to .3 and still hasn't fixed the problem. I had a recommendation to dump priv key then import it to another wallet. Can I import to coinbase? I really needed this transaction to go through yesterday :(

Yes, I have been letting it run all day.

Thanks! When I get home from work I will try it out!

What other wallet do you suggest I use to complete this process?

I'm pretty sure I had 0.8.2 before updating, I try to keep my wallet up to date as best as possible. Is it safe to uninstall and reinstall?
Also, even after updating, there is still a message at the top of my client that says "Warning: Displayed transactions may not be correct! You may need to upgrade, or other nodes may need to upgrade." wat do

Sorry I really only know the basic terminology of bitcoins but I'm using bitcoin-qt if that answers your question correctly. And I have absolutely no idea how to export the private key.

This has happened before and I couldn't fix it. It took months to fix itself, I can't wait that long again. Can I uninstall it and reinstall? Will I lose any bitcoins that way?

Sorry, I know very little about this whole process. What is the wallet.dat file? I see it in my computer but can't open it. I don't have an appdata folder (that I can see at the moment).
