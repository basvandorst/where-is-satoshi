Is it? Then why does it seem like casual violation is growing every year, and nearly everyone tries it ? I would say the majority have turned against copyright, albeit weakly.


If you support copyright, at least be honest about what it is. It is possible to support it without baldly calling it "theft", which it is simply not.  It is okay to be honest and say you support copyright monopolies even though nothing tangible is "stolen" when a behavioral monopoly is violated.


The public, apparently, by effectively ignoring it. 
You notice the big copy monopolists  stopped suing individual violators, and upped their quality a notch, enabling slightly convenient things like netflix and apple store. This is the only reason they arent already gone. The economy has already benefited from the weakening of copyright, and as a capitalist, I love things that help the market -- "lifting all boats" so to speak. 


I didnt feel particularly emotional about saying copyright should be abolished.  It has caused great harm and loss through history, so it will be good to see the end of it. I suspect perhaps you are more emotional about it using trigger phrases like "shoplifting" and "theft".

its very difficult to ensure you have a good copy of the site. Many, many fake/spoofed version are out there, and they look exactly the same but always generate destinations which can be robbed remotely. Also, paperwallets are very difficult to safely backup or restore. 
The paperwallet technique is dated advice from the early days of bitcoin; i would suggest using one of the other recommendations.
@_date: 2016-08-27 15:31:20


You have never tried it have you? 
Not only does the wallet make you prove you can restore it once, but it is incredibly difficult to have a typo or mistake due to the design of the phrase. 
You should really try these things once before you criticize them.

And your examples are things that cannot be "stolen". 
Can you sue the government for your social security number?  Is it your property or theirs?
If someone chooses the same password as you did, probably "copyrightloser2016", then did they steal it from you?


So presuming you were literate was too much. You know what it gives 
a monopoly upon, stop being a pretend imbecile. If you still think copyright
is somehow good, defend it as the temporary monopoly grant that it is, and stop
pretending it is anything else. 
There is another hint for you: if copyright is property, why does it expire? Why can
it belong to you in one place, and someone else 2 feet away ?


for now, by offering a lot more for a lot less. Exactly what I said.
If the trend continues, then people will continue gain the relief
that piracy bought them, hopefully ever increasing.

Without doing so, they have shared ownership of the coins. (with bitgo's role in the ownership primarily being to prevent disasters like the recent attack, and no other purpose.)

Well, its a start, but needs work.
I really think its best to avoid discussing mining with newbies. 
The legal section is pure scare mongering. You could write the exact same section about cash: untraceable, cult following among drug dealers, government trying to outlaw it. Do people generally feel the need to give that introduction for cash? Then dont do it for bitcoin.
Outdated storage advice - noone should store their bitcoin online unless they are a high risk trader ready to take a haircut. Never use old style paper wallets. Really should mention not using windows as well, phone or non-windows machines only. 
"Hard-wire" wallets ("hardware" typo) Is the only good advice: phone or non-windows PC + hardware wallet is really the only good option for newbies.
The trading section should emphasize not leaving funds on the exchanges, imo.

I think I can disagree with that. While energy may set a total cap on economic activity, there is a huge economic difference between a campfire and a server rack even though they expend the same amount of energy. 
There is plenty of room for economic growth on the efficiency side before you can make the argument that we are at some form of energy ceiling, economically. Also, automation is pretty amazing economically as well for a resource even more scarce than energy: conscious sentient thought.
The argument that technological progress is deflationary is simply restating that economic growth is inherently deflationary. When the economy grows, there is more value to be had for the same amount of work, so the buying power of all participants should go up.
The fact that our current financial system cannot handle deflation well is a bug, not a feature. Deflation is normal and natural, and what the central banks are saying works out to essentially:
"How can we prevent the average person from benefiting from economic growth"

In general its possible to measure the information content of the image. If it has more information inside it than it appears to need, the chances increase that it is containing stenographic content. The ratio of obviously needed information vs total information is not hard to measure.
So if you try to hide a whole picture inside a picture, its very easy to know that something is up. But if you try to hide just a short phrase into a very large image, it is probably impossible to detect with certainty in a well designed system.

Really you suck. *sigh*  you can barely bang out a post without reverting to juvenile calumny.
First of all everyone wants to make money and that's good. When the government gives rent extracting monopolies to cronies, they can afford to purchase media properties and drive them to the ground by abusing their userbase, and they are less concerned with the essentially tax funded loss, you have the current socialist phenomenon of using mass media as an instrument of state. 
Copyright itself is the fundamental evil which centralizes media, and the one of the key socialist technologies which stands in the way of capitalism. (This topic may be beyond you.)
At least on the internet the audience is less captive, so any significant centralized service (google, facebook, etc) can eventually fail and be replaced.
As I said before; increasing decentralization of media, and a less trusting audience are both boding well for the future. Casually tuning out is achieving what none of your tin foil ever would.

The message from the user, "Payment" is unsigned/unsecured. This means a look alike site could subvert the refund address. 
The solution is to move this to the signed "payment request" message. Perhaps a new field or else repurpose the "memo" field to require a specific json schema; perhaps indicate the refund address, description of what is being purchased, the customer identity, and the transaction id all in there. 
This needs to be something the user can verify; It not necessarily possible for this to be automatically verified by the user's software, at least not with the payment protocol alone.
Also, it is extremely important that the fetch url be directly the same as the signing certificate, and fetched by the same software which will verify the payment request signature. For example, if the browser downloads the payment request and then hands it to a wallet, its too late to properly secure; the URL must be downloaded by the wallet/verifying software. 
The user must be prompted to manually verify the identity, items, transaction number. The wallet should be able to automatically verify the refund address, and reject it if it does not belong to the same wallet. 
This means some new message is needed to get the refund address to the server in the first place.

You know, the air is allowed to touch other computers. Also, cosmic waves. The point is the airgapped machine itself is never networked directly. It would be pretty useless if the airgapped machine was causally disconnected from spacetime, so obviously there must be some form of sneakernet for it to be useful.
There are a good number of reasons to ensure the airgapped machine is never online, before or after. For one, ideally it doesnt even have any network adapters on it. (the bios can turn them on even if you dont want it to)
Second, the types of compromise possible only through a storage device are far fewer than the types possible through a full OS and networking stack. So unless the machine came from the factory compromised, it is much less likely to get a targeted malware introduced.

Im curious about the assertion that most coin is held on exchanges or other intermediaries. 
If finex, which was a noteworthy exchange had at least .8% and at most 4% of all BTC, then it seems unlikely that the majority is held in proxy.
I suspect they are counting all web wallets, which are generally risky but still in the custody of the user and not the intermediary in cases where the web wallet is well behaved. For example, blockchain.info could change their hosted wallet into a malicious form and thereby steal a significant number of coins from their users, they probably could not get access to all of them.

I think you know full well "printing" means the same thing as creating. Why be coy?  Fractional reserve relies upon printing money in the sense of incrementing integers in a computer's register.


Gold has many properties which make it easy to reserve. As I said earlier, metals were one of the first things fractionally reserved. This is well known. I gave you several reasons why this does not apply to bitcoin. Do you want to address any of them ?


It does not matter what I insist or do not. My point was that it is not possible to run a bitcoin fractional reserve sustainably for specific reasons. Do you have criticisms or analysis of any of those reasons?


Are those things good? People seemed to have no particular trouble buying houses for about 2 years wages up until 1900. I do not see any evidence that buying houses worth 10 years wages with debt financing is fundamentally better in a systemic sense.
Even if we assert that it is better for the sake of argument, it does not mean that people will automatically behave in a way needed to achieve it.

A house is a large purchase; the seller will want the coin under his own control or at least in an exchange they trust. This means the coin will have to actually exist and not merely be "paper coin".
There can be no federal reserve system, so interbanc settlement will have to be on the blockchain. This means banks can neither borrow to cover a run, nor can they expect any form of bail-out. Banks with proof of reserve will crowd out those without it.
So there is really no feasible way to run a fractional reserve for any length of time. Even going into reserve for a very short period runs a severe risk of a run and total collapse.
There are stronger theoretical methods to create a safe method for crypto fractional reserve, but simple financing large ticket purchases is not enough.

Sure. But is that better or is it worse? 
As the number of nodes goes up, especially lightly connected nodes, there is a point at which the as network propagation delays go up, which reduces the value of the network as a whole. By definition, the more nodes there are, the higher the bar becomes to count as "highly connected". Too many nodes can be as bad as too few.
I suspect that market economics will solve this problem automatically. If bitcoin is more heavily used, or used to transact more value, the value of being able to trustlessly validate on chain confirmations goes up, and thus the number of nodes will go up to match. 
So what if the value of bitcoin goes so high, that the node count balloons to the point that there are too many nodes? Well, as the size of blocks and thus cost of operating a node goes up, the number of nodes goes down. So most likely an exchange price increase for bitcoin is the only thing which can drive a block size increase consensus.

I always wonder about that logic: if you are dead or suffer traumatic brain injury will you even remember you have bitcoin in the first place? Even if you leave some hints behind, is anyone going to be in a position to deal with your coins? 
Also: what about altruism: letting your BTC die with you is the greatest way to donate to society: everyone else's coins become a little more valuable.
I suppose you could put recovery instructions printed on plastic or metal into a safe deposit box, but that might be short sighted as those are routinely opened by various people you might not expect. If there is someone you absolutely dont want to leave without the coin, perhaps you should move it to multisig with them now, and teach that person how to use it and get used to it before you are dead.

The point is that shockwaves dont transmit through the bitcoin ecosystem nearly so well as through the legacy system. A single bank collapse in a fractional reserve system can cause a domino effect, in which banks all over the world are affected in ways that surprise many people. A small bank in Lichtenstein goes under, then 6000 in bangalore lose their jobs, which the citizens of zambonia pay double taxes for 10 years... for example.
In the bitcoin world, losses are quickly firewalled to the people directly affected. When a bank collapses the depositors lose, but noone else. Bail ins are possible among fellow depositors, but bail-outs are impossible, so you never see socialized losses of a few across huge populations that were never even involved.
There is still economic fallout, but its much less strong. There is no such thing as a deflationary spiral in bitcoin land. There is no such thing as a collapse domino effect. There is no such thing as depression. 
The lack of monetary policy means each pool of investment is firewalled. It means 1 satoshi is always 1 satoshi, and never a sometimes satoshi.  It means a deposit IOU for 1 satoshi is always an IOU and never a satoshi. This is something new in the history of money.
Really, the main difference is that bitcoin either cannot be fractionally reserved, or else noone has figured out how to do it. This is unprecedented with money and thus very interesting. Its almost a perfect experiment in testing the Austrian model of the business cycle.

Which is good/ basic best practice. I would not suggest it be done any other way. Remember however: a bug in your spending wallet, for example an entropy deficit, can leak the private key on the second spend from the same address.


Which is good, but forensics are still a problem. You are opening the private life of your business, your customers, and ultimately anyone you pay with tainted funds. you are not only opening them up to the government, but to all people in the world. (that includes criminals) Do you routinely post all your bank transactions on your website? Why do it with bitcoin? Also, the information never expires - anytime you reuse an address you guarantee that eventually it will be deanonymized. It is simply a bad practice and should never be done.


A bitcoin address cannot be attacked by a quantum computer. But a single ecdsa key spend reveals the real public key behind the address. After that is public, it is a matter of time until the private key is computed - assuming there are quantum computers. It could be months, weeks, days or hours, depending on the efficiency of the quantum computer. 
I advise everyone to get to a state where you never reuse addresses, because the first attacks will target reused addresses. Do you want to be the canary or the miner?

Im not sure if you are trolling, but each point I listed was a difference between fiat and crypto. Once more:
* There can be fiat federal reserves / money creation authorities
* Interbanc fiat settlement is virtual (reserves swaps)
* Borrowed fiat funds can cover runs, and there can be fiat bail-outs
* Proof of reserves and proof of existence are both impossible with fiat and thus irrelevant
Do you want to refute any of these in particular? 


This would be the fractional reserve step, not step 4. You are also presuming that coinbase has told its users it will be loaning out bitcoin deposits, which they do not currently do, and that people will still keep depositing their coin there in that case, which is unlikely.  
Also, this step would break their ability to perform a proof-of-reserves.


The bitcoin can only physically exist in one place at a time. Unlike dollars, which are all virtual and the new virtual ones are indistinguishable from the old virtual ones, coinbase IOU's are measurably different from actual hard BTC.

You are not disputing anything I said, or even making a halfway decent attempt. You sound desperate. Did you lose money on finex? Or perhaps you are a legacy banker?


The point is that it is new, not that it is "OK".


It just got tested. Havent you been paying attention? No other exchanges even flinched.


Perhaps. OTOH, it may prove that its simply not possible to fractionally reserve  a currency which has an unambiguous settlement characteristic. Previous methods of reservation are clearly not going to work, and the usual defenses against a bank run are not possible. I wont say its impossible for ever, but clearly it is not possible today.


Well, it should be easy for you to show a counter example then. Not metals, romans have been reserving them since antiquity. Not pottery claim tokens, they have always been reserved and hardly even resist counterfeiting. Salts/Beans/Shells and such commodities you can simple collect/produce.
Do you have an example? Didnt think so.

Not that hard... he is certainly padding in unnecessary jargon, and the phrasing is a bit tortured. But the idiomatic usage is obvious. Its easy to criticize the prose, but why dont we focus on the content instead.
 I also see it is likely that bitcoin offers certain advantages for international trade, specifically erasing the need for foreign reserves bootstrapping and allowing direct decentralized settlement between trade partners.

Do you have any evidence of that ? If anything it seems the opposite is true.
Regardless, bitcoin has properties fiat currencies lack.
It seems you did not understand why there is value in direct, irreversible, settlement. Perhaps you have not dealt with international invoicing or factoring? The is a huge time delay in clearing large amount, and the ever present chance of transaction reversal. There are also random liquidity crises, such as the situation in greece, in which the euro could not be moved from greek banks.
@_date: 2016-04-30 15:13:45


This is not the reason for the crisis whatsoever. Greek reserves are irrelevant because the Euro is already liquid. Interest rates have nothing to do with it whatsoever. 
Being cut off from the rest of the of euro banking system was the acute cause, effectively making the greek bank euro not a euro. The reason that was done is because the greek government was spending more than the rest of europe wanted to subsidize. 
Switching to a national fiat does nothing to solve the problem, fundamentally. Though it might mitigate acute trade blockage, the core root cause remains.

Im not saying its wrong; im saying that it is deceptive. A constant rate of increase will always look exponential in simple price terms. look at any compound interest chart and you will see the same shape. 
You are obsessed with the gold standard, but by the time it was abolished it had long been ignored. A standard of gold equivalence which had not been enforced, and could not be used by anyone was no standard at all. And even when it is enforced, there are still credit bubbles and busts, such as the great depression. The problem cannot be solved with a gold standard alone.

Well, BU is a form of attack, and we are undergoing it, and no i dont like it. 
That is the nature of open networks is that anyone can attack them.
Regarding segwit, even worst case individual users have to opt in, so if nobody likes it then it is meaningless. The good part of a well designed voluntary system is that noone is forced to use it. 
In this case, the powers behind BU want to prevent anyone from having the choice to use segwit, because it enhances privacy, reduces transaction fees, and perhaps because they want bitcoin to die so they are opposed to any improvements in general.
Segwit is how bitcoin should have been done from day one. It was an oversight due to satoshi not being a professional cryptographer. The downside of being a brilliant polymath may be that there are too many things to know them all deeply.

And of course, having less than 50% of the mining power participating would be bad.

Rather than orphaning blocks outright, there could be a slowing increasing "difficultly delta for non-segwit blocks" Perhaps in the first month it is very small, like 0.1% penalty. Then it doubles every month until the difficultly delta is capped at a 100% penaltly. (meaning they will have to mine at half efficiency from then onwards)

Lowers the barrier to entry for competing forums. 
Reddit currently supports "pay-to-play" astroturfing from certain partners, and easily blocks it from others. Rather than being able to abuse their network effect stickiness, and forum which started manipulating content would quickly find itself abandoned with low friction and minimal user capture time. 
Reddit used to be fairly good, was sold to big media interests, and they are now getting their money's worth by manipulating people's opinions. They work hand-in hand to develop better astroturfing tools to shape appearances, and use various techniques to prevent communities from forming to counter them, or at least to isolate and contain them.
For example: brigading is not astroturf since it is real users performing it. But reddit uses the brigading argument to shut down communities or individuals it's sponsors dont like. Bots and scripted duplicate accounts otoh are quite easy to detect and block, so the only way they could work here is with an intentional integration effort. Reshaping reporting is another; inflate the vote counts and user counts for things you want to make look better, deflate/reduce for the opposite. 
A distributed reddit would have little or no incentive to do these same things. If it became less useful to the actual people, users would easily shift to others servers/forums which remained more interesting without having to create new accounts, or learn/find new websites. There would be no way to squat on basic words like "politics" since there would be no inherent ontology, and various politics subs would compete to maintain the preeminent position.
There would also be no single buy-out target since any bought nodes would lose value quickly.

It will be less secured, at least temporarily, but that does not immediately translate into less value. If anything, recent evens tell us the prices can more in surprising ways. With a lack of liquidity, and being the only version on some exchange, a supply crunch might cause a price spike even. It could also dump down, but there is no guarantee.
All of your following assumptions predicate on that one. 


With reduced capacity, there is a near certainty of a temporary price spike in fees, especially as people with important transactions pay more to get them moved. Certainly every person moving to a forked chain would try to dump, and be willing to pay a premium to do so. This will provide extra incentive as well.
You also fail to account for dark mining capacity; with reduced competition higher fees an opportunity to take a larger market share could light up mining units which are currently powered down or being used for other purposes.
So while it is still a possibility, a big chunk of miners even 95%, is not enough to guarantee death by difficulty. Above 95% it becomes more likely, as that is a near consensus - however if it is BU which represents the new fork it is unlikely to be stable for long, and another hardfork wold surely follow soon after as the nodepool shrinks monotonically..

I think rational miners should want that. But its a thin margin business which requires constant effort; why have that when you can have an easy money making ponzcoin of the week. Bitcoin is kindof a sink for them; unregulated free market capitalism abhors a profit margin. If everyone participates in the fair market, there is no "get rich quick" angle for them or anyone else.
BU, as a method to inevitably destroy bitcoin, offers an opportunity to push a series of alt coins and pyramid type schemes, premies, etc. And it doesnt have to work forever: just until the scammers behind it, ver, vorhees, et al, can get out of the game.  You just have to get that pesky reliable main chain out of the way.
Dash, monero, eth, and other similar pumpNdumps didnt make them billionaires, but there are maybe millions to be had duping the entire bitcoin core community. Its also low risk for them right now, because signaling brinksmanship is free, and they dont have to move on it until it looks like a sure thing.

I'm aware of the calibration time. Its not unprofitable is there is a shortage of miners. Because each miner gets a correspondingly larger share of the reward, you can gain significant share of blocks mined with a fraction of the previous requirement, which is enough to tease the miner's back for some easy rewards. With 10% of the mining power you still get a block every 100 minutes, there are still rewards during the time. The two week retarget, in order to be a death sentence, would have to leave nearly no hashpower left whatsoever. And once it hit, that would tempt even more miners.
I doubt a difficulty fork would be needed in any case.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:33:26
Seems to have a few flaws. First of all it scales on Proof of Stake, which is a flawed mining philosophy. The blockreward is an exchange for securing the network, not a freebie given to hodlers for essentially nothing. 
Second, the idea the mining is "waste" computation is a flawed thermodynamic assumption. The energy that goes into mining is exactly the "cost" barrier needed to prevent bad actors from damaging the network.
Last, allthough he says the computations are trivial, it still relies on the "smallest hash proof", which means the same exact use of hash power as used by PoW applies here, except now you can magnify your hashpower with hodling. This PoS algorithm seems primed for rapid network collapse.
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:49:35
A) If it has its value even temporarily from momentum, it will attract the mining power needed to make it functional and overcome the difficulty reset time. Unless miners can act anti-economically in a unified enough manner then it doesnt die.
B) If the value on the minority chain was rising, and was not attractive to current miners, it could cause some spare capacity to be re enabled as it becomes economical again. This would be especially likely post-reset. 
Your assumption that it must be a multi-month period is only in the case that there is some other viable use of mining time, or else someone shuts off all their mining equipment in spite, and there is noone willing to enter the market of any type.
Just because miner's secure the living hell out of some fork does nothing to guarantee it any market value. Im sure the attackers plan to run some form of pump operation, but it is unlikely to succeed.

You are right for soft forks, but not in the case of hard forks. A chain with as little as 5% support may still survive and may even come back to achieve parity with the 95% chain.
So long as a hard fork has &gt;95% support, and a clear benefit to all that is near unanimous, it is fairly safe to activate with a flag day. Otherwise, they are effectively network forks, creating new separate currencies.

Close, not bad I would say.
But, it is not really enough. To truly be cold storage, you have to do a bit more.
Get a computer (like a cheap linux netbook for $200) that has never and will never be connected to any network. Ever. Install a clean linux with hard drive encryption. Install your desired wallet via a CD or USB stick, and using that export your watch only wallet back out the same way via USB key or CD drive. DO NOT save anything on this computer - always wipe out any files. (in tails, this means do not use persistence) Power it off when not using
In short, your cold storage machine is ENCRYPTED, EMPTY (of secrets), and OFF nearly all the time. The only time you power it up is to sign a transaction,
The USB key you use for transfers is sensitive as well. Its best if you format it to be encrypted - dont use windows or mac formats use linux encryption. Also, keep it blank after use. Also, dont use it for anything else besides this one purpose.

I dont fully agree; if you choose to earn and spend in bitcoin terms, that absolutely helps bitcoin's liquidity.  But choosing to increase or decrease your holdings is the primary determiner of value.
You could have spent 800 btc on a fridge, but at the same time not depleted your holdings by either earning back or shifting back your other assets to replace what bitcoin you spent. You may have helped some gift card seller get off the ground, but you also abandoned your holdings.

12 words are enough entropy to be secure, but they could not come up with a way to do key recovery safely in the case that your computer is compromised.

Transaction signaling could be an amazing BIP. This would potentially solve the "voting problem".
Miners can easily vote in a measurable way. 
Up till now, individual users have no valid way to make their voice heard. However, with each transaction you send you provide the fuel which runs the system: the txfee. If you could ensure your txfee carried your voice, then the true voice of the economy majority could be heard and measured.
The vast majority would remain apolitical, but some small number of users would be willing to pay the small difference in fee and time to cast a vote. The small difference would be enough to reward miners who match the will of the economy more closely than those who do not.
* An extra part of the transaction which indicates mandatory block signaling flags. This transaction can only be valid if the including block matches at least the signaling flags. (could have two masks, an "AND" must match mask and a "NOT AND" must not match set)
* Ideally it would be in non-block space, so it can be pruned and forgotten. This would mean it is included in witness data post segwit, and not something which should be done pre-segwit.
* Fully validating nodes would have to check this data once, other nodes would never need to see it.

Cash is also a settlement system. The core debate is not whether it is for payments or for settlements; its how expensive and fast should the typical bitcoin transaction be.
Time factor makes it more appropriate for large=slow/expensive transactions. Waiting an hour is fine for a house but rather annoying for a dinner bill. Most people's answer is to assume risk by requiring fewer confirmations.
Expense ratio has also for a long time been low, low enough for smaller transactions but too expensive for micropayments. Its clear bitcoin will never be much good for micro-payments. Very small payments, like a singel candy bar, also dont make much sense for bitcoin. 
With a ten or twenty times rise in value, it may price bitcoin out of the small transaction range such that buying a small breakfast would be in appropriate while a large dinner would be marginal.
Its clear that bitcoin needs backup, no matter which side of the debate you are on. We need a small payments system with faster confirmations, and lower fees, which uses some form of periodic settlement. We need a network for micropayments, perhaps using pre-funded channels. We need (working) system like kickstarter for crowdfunding, we need an escrow and reputation network to counter-balance physical goods risks, we need a reversible payment channels systems for high risk purchases.

This might not be as easy as it sounds. The price of BTC can spike suddenly. If a month ago you sold above market  then you were trying to replace what you sold, by today you would have lost out big. So to cover your bases you have to sell at well above market, high enough that you might dissuade the buyer from buying in the first place.
Secondly you have a money problem. Fiat money is stuck usually in a single country's system, and depending on the locality the available exchanges may have limited volume, and can offer poor prices for extended amounts of time.
Also, moving money internationally can be quite risky, and getting a few million locked up or frozen can destroy all the profit from the sale and then some. Nothing is quite so good at this as international transfers and moving large amounts around related to crypto currency.
No, making a big block sale like this is seldom a great idea. Its much more logical to stick to small sales spaced out over time, so you can be sure you are getting and keeping your profit in a safe form.

Given disk storage costs of $0.10 per GB per month, and 104GB of block history, means you get $10 per month maximum savings, realistically perhaps $5. With 20 nodes running all the time, you could save up to the value of 1 developer hour per month. With 1000 nodes, youll be able to afford 50 developer hours per month, which is a touch over a business week. 
A good dev who can work in core, is available to test, validate and maintain a fullnode codebase plus a patch, and can keep it up to date with core without breaking existing DB implementations, it seems reasonable to spend that amount of time, perhaps a shave less. 
So, to break even reasonably, considering typical disk space costs, typical developer skill level, and typical developer time pricing, you should be looking to run about 2K nodes continuously in order to hope to break even on that investment. If you can change any of those variables, it may work out different. If you can run fewer nodes or get cheaper disks, then it changes even further in favor of not getting the work done.
And if you ever need txindex you end up throwing all this work away, and txindex is mighty helpful when you want to scan modern wallets.

They are trusted number crunchers, not storage despite their marketing. Your memory or a scrap of paper are more then enough to store all the bitcoins in the world.

Well for starters some people will get paid in BTC or similar. Internet contractors, expats, people in countries with currency controls, people in countries with high inflation, etc. Its not just hobbyists.
Those people will like to spend or convert their money so they can spend it, so one common way may start off as spend-integration. (deposit your bitcoin, spend on a legacy network) 
On the other side, some merchants will want to get paid in btc, even if their customers come using a legacy currency/network. They can do buy-integration, like bitpay. 
For the time being, these will be the most popular, but increasingly I can see that as these pools grow to meaningful levels, there will be opportunities to cut out all the currency exchange to save points. 
This will be easiest on e-wallet transactions. For super old networks, like credit card networks, there is no flexibility. But a mobile wallet protocol can be much more extensible.
An open standard for e-wallet protocols could help a lot here; if there was an open standard for mobile phone wallets that any app could plug in to, combined with an open standard for POS terminals, which different payment networks could plug in to, could mean direct bitcoin wallet to cash register wallet transactions, or legacy visa card to bitpay transactions, etc etc. Coinbase's shift card, if it was upgraded to a smarter app, could detect if the cash register accepted bitcoin and in that case pay directly without even using the VISA network at all. Of couse coinbase could never do that intentionally, but they could be plugged in to an open wallet protocol in which case the end user could decide which payment system to use on their phone.

This is a bunch easier than you may realize.
Most/all places have some level of internet connection, at least at the narrowband level. Worst case a rooftop satellite only for payments, but often something better.
The internet allows for POS to be operated in a web app, assuming you have a web ready POS terminal (cash register), getting plugged in to new payment systems could be as easy as a few clicks in a browser.
This equally applies to things like paypal or venmo, but bitcoin does have the advantage of being frictionless (dont need your name or personal info, doesnt need any credit line or credit checks, no linking to a bank system, no delay in funds received, etc)
If many 3rd party services offer bitcoin as an automatic option, many places could start accepting bitcoin before they realize it.(via a curreny mapper) Since bitcoin is hard currency, its easy to downgrade to legacy payment currencies.

If you bought shares in a company with dollars or any currency, and suddenly the value of the currency itself skyrocketed, you would have to expect that your dividends and shares prices would be correspondingly smaller in terms of that currency in order to keep the same value.
You cannot eat your cake and have it too: if you sell currency X to buy shares Y, you miss out on rises in X, period, even if it pays dividends in X.
This does not mean there is anything wrong with transacting in bitcoin, or denominating shares in bitcoin. If bitcoin keeps rising rapidly it may seem weird to see the nominal value of your shares constantly dropping, however.

I know it devalues currency; but that only matters if the devaluation escapes into the public market. 
Imagine you and I started printing billions of dollars, but we only used it to trade art back and forth between ourselves, and never leaked any of the new money out. The new billions would impact the price of our paintings, but wouldnt cause any other form of inflation.
QE is rather like that; it props up the value of stocks, keeps bond yields low, keep real estate prices high, but the new money mostly never leaves the balance sheets of the big banks and brokerages. They dont lend it out, then dont spend it out; if they did the inflation you expect would arise.
The keynsians think they can unwind this by eventually deleting the new money as the economy grows and other sources of wealth prop up stock prices. They have not been able to do that, so tons of fake money stays in the hands of the government, and in the hands of big financial institutions, and they cant raise interest rates or spur the economy much.
But this is fine to them; because you have to remember their real goal is not to grow the economy, nor is it to encourage any form of change or progress; they simply want control; When the core cronies can afford to buy anything they don't like in order to extinguish it, they are content to live off the fat of the populace and enjoy their fiefdom. They dont want it to collapse, but they dont care if it stagnates either.

nakamoto consensus scales poorly by blocksize, in the realm of O(n^2).
To get a 2X performance increase in txrate, you get a doubling of bandwidth, storage, and CPU requirements multiplied by the number of nodes. You also get a massive increase in corner cases and griefing possibilities, and a larger attack surface. The damage caused by malleability or spam attacks can be multiplied more easily than valid traffic, so network performance could actually suffer.
If you want to read about real solutions to the problem of scale, read here:

The beauty of the scammers is that their argument is dumbed down enough that people think they understand it, while the actual reality is a touch harder to grasp.

The security of the self chosen passphrase becomes the only thing protecting the key, instead of the full origination entropy. BIP38's flaws include user selected passwords. Bip39 passwords should be chosen by dice and/or a random number generator. 
A bip39 paperwallet is like a bip38 paperwallet without the paper; the passphrase alone can fully regenerate the wallet, so you really dont need to write it down.


bip39 *is* the passphrase. If you write it down, thats the same as writing down your bip38 passphrase on to the paperwallet itself. It becomes a bearer bond.

Perhaps I can try, in case anyone needs a TLDR: 
The Sha256 hash operates on 64 bytes at a time, but the block header is 80 bytes. This means sha256 works on the block headers in two distinct parts, a 64 byte block, and a 16 byte block.
A normal miner must re-hash all 80 bytes for each attempt to mine a block. 
An attacker, rather than performing all the work of hashing all 80 bytes,  finds a way to change the block header such that the last 16 bytes remain the same, they can re-use some of the work to hash the last 16 bytes, and only hash the starting 64 bytes for each attempt to mine a block.
@_date: 2017-04-23 15:30:09
Well, you move the security of a 256 bit random down to a user selectable passphrase, which in hard crypto are worthless. 
There is no way to memorize a bip38 paper wallet, so you lose the paper its gone. 
Very dangerous to spend -&gt; best to sweep the first time it is decoded, and be careful with change.
Lets not forget the most popular bip38 site, bitadrress, is in the control of known scmamers who are incentivized to play games with the random numbers.
The modern paperwallet is generated with paper and dice, and is a bip39 menmonic driving a bip44 wallet. you can easily memorize it and not lose everything with the piece of paper. There is no need for a second passphrase which will always be weak. And they are easy to import into a great number of wallets safely, without the risks of change loss or identity compromise.

The "popularity" or "bored" state of the peanut gallery does not matter in the slightest. People are bored of the dollar, bored of mutual funds, but so long as they use them to buy, spend , or store value it doesnt matter how "bored" they are. These are economic tools not entertainment content.
The scaling debate has a solution. The core is just about right sized for modern technology, but retail transactions need a strong set of L2 solutions. This has always been anticipated from the earliest days.
I personally think something like segwit is inevitable; either via the old miner supported consensus, or via a carefully orchestrated and maximally compatible flag day. The reason is obvious; having self-affecting hash identity is a simple and obvious cryptography design flaw in the block/transaction structure and the benefits to remedying that are universal.
Minimizing the chances of a network split, and keeping a strong economic consensus is key. IT may be a few years yet until we change the protocol, which should give software developers ample time to have ecosystem software in place.

Well, yes. Some things are straightforward enough that any compelling argument to counter would spread more widely among informed people. I'm always willing to entertain reasonable arguments; in fact you could post one now about how the increased bandwidth and storage requirements seem to benefit spammers and attacker more than legitimate traffic could be countered by some method which makes an increase in block size in advance of a global improvements in average latency, bandwidth, and storage costs somehow viable ?
If not, lets wait while murphy's law does it slow work across the globe and only increase fundamental constants when it is a sound decision, and not because some known criminals see advantage there.
There is no such argument right now, and an "informed" person who thinks primitive raw blocksize should go up is in fact almost certainly not informed at all, or else they could simply provide said argument.
Not all opposition arguments are valid; not all stories have two sides. In the current time and reality, there is a simple reality, and no amount of sideshow grandstanding or well financed astroturf can change that, no matter how well curated the narrative. I.E. put up or shut up.

Its possible you have gotten a darling rate there; If you are really earning 3% APY on a current account then you are holding one of the best fiat investments possible short of receiving large unbacked loans.
I would be careful not to rely upon official estimates of inflation however, as the people who produce them have an interest in understating the rate of inflation. 
There is also lost deflation which is much harder to compute; we live in a time of rapid technological advancement; automation, networked commerce, p2p revival, regulatory bypass, etc. This naturally causes deflation, and what you should be seeing is the value of your money increasing every year. by a few points, not holding at zero.
Right now, there is no asset class which will help you avoid this "lost deflationary opportunity" because the only things that track it are either subject to monetary policy (fiat) or else have baked in inflation which still cancels it (bitcoin at 4%)
Perhaps after 4 more years, assuming no major disasters, bitcoin will be regularly deflationary.
Metals are tricky for many reason, they can be fractionally reserved in their liquid forms, they are hard to move/trade/confirm in their hard forms, they are subject to sharp changes in demand/popularity, are often manipulated by monetary policy tools, and may even be subject to drastic supply increases within our lifetimes.

Thats a very poor definition of inflation. Prices can change for a number of reasons without being inflation. You can also have the relative popularity of a currency change, which is also not inflation, but does affect prices.
You can have "natural" inflation caused by economic recession, and "natural" deflation cause by economic growth. This bitcoin will be subject to, as are all commodities, such as steel. 
Intentional inflation caused by monetary policy however is of a different nature, and this type of inflation bitcoin is not subject to. It is an intention devaluation of the money supply in order to redistribute wealth.

Toeing the line ensures their reputation, rather than showing the emperor's lack of clothing. You have this bit backwards.


Have you read them? Discounting the things which matter, like food, gas, rent, education, while focusing on luxuries or entertainment. 
All things accounted for however, I do think inflation is relatively low recently, especially due to the low price of oil. If you consider housing and education however, it is still high. Overall, it seems like most policy driven inflation has been confined to equities. So the amount leaking out into everyday products is low, for now.
All I'm saying is not to blindly trust the reported inflation rates. If equity prices somehow spill out into the wider economy, it could mean very rapid inflation.

Classic socialism, blaming the free market for the action of government.
Every single one of those involves fiscal/monetary policy and fractional reserve banking. 
If big words are hard for you I can dumb it down: government taxes, government spending, and banks with special privileges of connections to government.
Lets start with the first one: the fact that it says "state bankruptcy" should have given you a clue.
Lets take a look at the panic of 1819: Huh not three years after a bank gets a federal charter we have one of the first economic crisises in american history. Its like clockwork istn it. 
Can you pick out one of those which you believe does not involve socialism ?
Its so startlingly obvious you are living in some kind of denial mode here: read literally anything at all about your crisises and find a single one that doesnt involve government tax/spend and govt privileged or govt chartered banks.

This is correct; and assuming all loans were paid back 100% + interest, then there would never be enough money, and the fed would always be issuing new debt.
However, if a certain number of default/bankruptcies happen, then the loop is closed. 
For example, the fed creates $100 at Bank Alpha at 3% interest. The bank then loans $5 to "Random Bob" using a "real" $1 but  "printing" $4.
"Random Bob" then spends all of it at "Grocery Store", declares bankruptcy, and never repays the loan.
Bank Alpha now has $99 dollars of reserves, plus $5 deposited into the account of "Grocery store", for a total of $104. The bank could fully repay the Fed, and still have $1 left over.

Abstract demand is infinite and as unquenchable as the void.
Concrete demand, or funded demand, can only exist for products and service for which there is already supply, or well understood concepts of supply. 
This is why innovation is the process of thinking up new products and services, not the process of wanting more stuff. 
Certainly, all entrepreneurs sincerely hope that demand will arise for their new product or service.

And while mortgages can be beneficial in that they give people more options, they are also negative in that they are an extremely distorted market. Carrying a 400K debt for a house which should be worth 40K does not make more wealth available to the economy; it make more wealth available to those with the power to "print" money at the expense of everyone else. Separating fractional reserve from mortgages would allow their benefits to work without the negatives. 
And the easiest way to kill fractional reserve is to let anyone do it without special state-granted privileges.

The rough amount of btc out there is not hard to calculate, and the total amount that ever will be is too.
For whatever reason, at current prices, its not high enough to motivate more people to trade it for the btc they are holding. Each holder feels perfectly comfortable holding on to the amount they have, even knowing they could likely trade it at for the current market price.
To round out temporary spikes, I wouldnt compute "market cap" on less than a 7 day average.  
It does give you a rough idea of how much interest people have in holding bitcoin.
Similarly, you could say that Bank of America has a 8.2 billion BTC worth of deposits in dollars. It is meaningless in the sense that you could not ever obtain that amount of BTC, but it does give you a relative indication of how much more interest people have in a bank of america bank account vs holding some BTC.

Sticky prices are increasingly a thing of the past. Grocery stores can reprice their entire inventory in a day. Online shopping reprices in real time. Wages tend to be relatively fixed, but people accepting bitcoin wages are used to receiving variable amounts of bitcoin. 
In the modern economy, the importance. of sticky prices and wages would be much reduced, I suspect. Ultimately, they are a temporary effect, which can delay but not prevent market signals from propagating.

A deconstruction with no math or formulas?
"Market Cap" makes some sense for a stock, because it is feasible that someone could buy out a stock for its current market cap, then own it without changing the value of the shares at all, nor having any fallout. While bidding for the stock, they might drive the price up, but likely not to the moon. It can and does happen regularly.
Someone cornering btc down to the last satoshi would have a problem, as bitcoins value would likely drop to zero if they succeed, which they cannot, as unlimited buying would drive the price rapidly to the moon and beyond any available number of dollars.

This was true; some merchants made cash user subsidize card users. 
This was a big part of the growth of the credit payments industry, convincing merchants to effectively steer people towards it.
By today enough people pay with cards that prices have had to go up to cover it.


Is an illusion. You are the one who pays. 
There may not be an easy alternative for you, especially in places which dont
charge a surcharge for credit card usage, and dont give a "cash discount". (This is getting more common, especially at smaller shops where the owner is the manager)
But you dont have to get caught in the illusion that it is free or that you are being paid to use it; you are most certainly paying for the benefits, and then some.

You know perfectly well nothing is safe from a windows machine or malware rooted android, as every outgoing BTC transaction will be redirected. You are also perfectly aware that time travel is impossible.
His answer that using a different BIP32 path help security is ridiculous: it does nothing to stop a user from data-entering their same mnemonic in situation in which they should not do so. The only difference is that their funds will be mysteriously missing from the balance although just as compromised. So it hurts ordinary users by does not hinder attackers at all.
If that was the true motivation for incompatibility, then breadwallet would not even support the same words as bip39, to prevent users from doing that. But supporting the same bip39 standard with a non-standard derivation path is simply bull-headed, and snide responses no do not change that. 
At least he should own up to the gratuitous incompatibility, rather than hide behind some BS security justification that does not hold water.

A USD/BTC trade, at the current price, does not affect the equation at all, it merely changes the account holders.
Incremental demand for a low volume commodity always causes a seemingly disproportionate change in terms of the larger commodity, at least until supply and demand equalize again. To gain parity with the commodity size of even a single USD fiat bank, the exchange rate would have to rise to about 2000 times its current level.
1 additional cash USD "deposited" is not a comparable transaction.
You realize the individual who deposited the dollar had to get it from somewhere, right?  Creation/Destruction of bank money vs cash money is not even relevant here.

miner's dump by definition: the btc they have didnt exist before. They would have had to buy it to get it. Any way you look at it, conventions costs were spent ( electricity, salaries, equipment costs, what have you) and BTC where obtained. 
They may buy it for cheaper than the commodity market price, but they are buying it nonetheless. 
The bottom line is it doesnt matter whether they immediately dump to fiat or not.
If the cost of mining was completely disassociated from the price of BTC, then it would be a different story - this is unlikely because then more people would mine opportunistically. For example, the cost of mining a diamond to debeers is radically disconnect from the price of diamonds on the open market; so by choosing how much they dump; they set the price of diamonds as they choose. 
In bitcoin, all you need is electricity, so there is not a large barrier to entry.

There is a difference. 
if 2000 BTC trades hands every 10 minutes, of which 25 is created. full 2000 now enter the market, ready to be re-sold. Price would be steadily dropping if demand was not steadily rising, every ten minutes, because the supply is growing.
At the halvening, only 1987.5 BTC are available into that demand. So either the price goes up a little to shake loose 12.5 extra from somewhere, or else demand drops down to 1987.5. 
Then, 10 minutes later, it comes up short again. If the price has normalized, then somewhere someone provides the missing 12.5 from their personal supply. If not, then the prices inches up again.
Rinse and repeat this, 24 hours a day, forever. 
Each 10 minutes, either demand goes down a bit, or price goes up.
At some point, they neutralize, and we have a new normal.
The question is: how well is this already priced in? Has some speculator bought enough bitcoin now, so that when the halvening hits, total demand will simply drop to 1987.5, without any price rise? Its also possible there could be an army of people buying a few hoping for a halvening bump. if they dont see it, then they might re-sell, providing the missing supply at the same price for a while. 
Gut feeling seems to be that the constant lack of new btc going into the system will cause prices to rise eventually, at least a little bit. Demand is measurably rising now, and it will be facing half as much resistance as before.

Surely you will concede that there are no more than 21 million BTC, correct?

Seriously? You could obtain 8.2 billion BTC out of the 21million BTC that would ever exist?
Would you like to explain this feat?


I said deposits at one bank. They can run a simple sum query and get an exact number, which they periodically report. These deposits all belong to some person or entity. 
Perhaps your reading comprehension is failing you. 


That is your own straw man, and not really what I said. If you read again, you will see that I am saying something else. It is a relative level of interest in terms of dollars, and yes it is different than a stock market "market cap" in many ways, such that it should really have a different name.
Deposits at one bank in terms of BTC are very comparable to outstanding BTC in terms of dollars, in terms of gauging relative market demand.

I always feel that these words are evidence of people without the right data (supply and demand motivations) trying to find meaning in the data that they do have (price/volume history)
Outside of pure speculators, who are not hodlers, I feel like price history has nearly no predictive value.
I also understand that the only hard data we have is price/transaction history, and its hard not to rely on in when we are so hungry for hard data to make predictions with.
Market-speak for bitcoin would be much more compelling if it had real data instead of wishful thinking.
Its not burned like oil, nor KYC'd like fiats, nor can a fake transaction be readily distinguished from a real one, and OBC traffic like as done by exchanges is mostly invisible except what the exchanges choose to report.

WIll it be possible for it to work in bip44 compatible mode? m/0'/0'/0' seems like a useless path, so far as compatibility.
While I do see the advantage of all private derivation, this also has the huge operational downside that the wallet has to be "hot" all the time. I think it would be nicer to have a walled that can run effectively "cold", with no knowledge of the private key material in any form.
The Ideal for this patch, imo, is for the wallet to default to bip44 + cold mode operation, with a full mnemonic unlock or else a strong password partial unlock of the current branch account.

Holding always available money in a bank should cost something. But the dollar is a soft currency so businesses expect to get interest for their deposits. 
How will businesses react?
* Moving any excess cash to less liquid investments which bear interest.
* Reducing cash positions by paying down debt, or optimizing liquid capital turnover
* Paying out dividends, or performing equity buybacks

Thats correct, every core node implementation must be continually code reviewed, tested and incrementally improved to make sure no vulnerabilities or crashes creep in. The rate of change is slow and meticulous, with heavy review to ensure it is safe to deploy in a high contentious adversarial environment. Even then, a bug may be quickly patched or fixed without compromising the network because the core protocol itself does not have this property, so even a misbehaving node cannot break the whole network. All nodes would have to have a severe flaw simultaneously to do that, which is unlikely since upgrades are staggered over months.
ETH gets that risk level for each individual transaction contract, but without all the review and testing, and a single failure loses all associated funds. Technically they arent even bugs, just surprising valid behaviors, by definition. I mean, you have heard of the Dao right? It was obvious this would happen from the first description of Eth, but somehow thick-skulled people just dont seem to grok it, apparently even until today.

This is not entirely true. 
There are three factors controlling the fate of a currency, each important
* Commodity Factor
* Force of Arms
* Denomination
"Commodity Factor" is the one you speak of. It is the most important factor: what people will trade for the currency, and what people expect that they can trade for the currency in the future.
"Force of Arms" is another important factor. It is when some group will use martial power to defend a currency. For example ,they may force you to accept it in trade against your will (legal tender, eminent domain, Gresham's law). They may demand that you buy it against your will (taxes). They may also take out loans in your name with it, then force you to pay it back for them (treasuries, bonds) While not as important as the previous factor, it is very important in affecting valuation.
'Denomination" is another important factor. Salaries, wages, and prices, when denominated in a given currency, tend to raise the value of that currency and stabilize its value. Contracts cannot usually be re-written half-way through. Retailers do not like to change prices on their whole stock multiple times per day. Employees do not accept sudden decreases in the salary amounts. In general, rather than rushing around repricing everything, people just accept the loss or gain meekly, and keep the prices set the same. This has the effect of stabilizing a currencies value quite strongly. ("sticky wages", "sticky prices")
It is unlikely that bitcoin can eve benefit from "Force of Arms". The reasons a powerful military would endorse a currency are usually to gain the power of taxation and manipulation, which bitcoin does not provide.
It might be possible to get sticky prices in bitcoin, but not with current volatility levels. At most short contracts or wages could be safely set with the currency. A one hundred fold increase in current valuation might bring enough stability to allow for longer term contracts, wages, and prices to be denominated in bitcoin units.
At current levels, a one-time contract might make sense, or a employment contract with a 3-month time frame could be plausible. An online merchant that updates prices hourly could certainly exist.

Initially when money is worth less property is worth more, you will be more eager to trade property to get the money since you can get so much for so little property. This is the shared illusion part: demand for money goes up and so the value of it goes up as it becomes more scarce.
Eventually, If every tiny penny in your pocket could buy houses and cars, would you keep holding them or start spending and enjoying ? Maybe even retire and start living the high life? Of course everyone will have the same idea, and there will be a flood of people trying to dump their money, and thus the value of it goes back down to normal pretty fast. 
So there is a natural value of money which meets what the size of the economy requires. For bitcoin, the biggest factor is how many people consider it to be money.

RE testing; the code needs to be factored out into separate purpose specific portions. The incestuous relationship between the IRC core, the maker/taker objects, and the misused message interface makes the code harder to work with than not. For starters, making the maker/taker implementations completely ignorant of IRC's existence would be a good start. (the logic should work even without an IRC channel in the middle.)
About the actual protocol: 
my understanding is that you have short lived takers of ephemeral identity, and longer lived makers of pseudonymous identity. You can always have misbehaving makers, so various methods could vet them (including a simple blacklist for starters)  So, lets assume the initial trust is on the part of the maker trusting some unknown taker.
* ioauth Utxo's should be non-existent hypothetical utxo's that the maker could create as outputs. If the transaction does not complete, the addresses will be discarded never to be used.. The maker can specify multiple outputs.
* The tx message should include taker inputs which are either on the blockchain, or include supporting transactions which meet the criteria to prove that they could reasonably be on the blockchain, and as usual the makers utxo's and change outputs.
* Signatures, such as used by ioauth, should always cover the whole message and not just a portion.
* After the sig message the taker can then provide back to the maker the remaining signatures, and possibly supporting transactions needed to create inputs.
* if all the takers inputs are supported, then the maker has everything he needs to post the transaction(s) to the blockchain, and does so.
* If the taker's inputs are not supported, the maker will not release his supporting transactions
* The taker can pay a small fee (separately) to receive the supporting TX, or else the taker can provide the missing support and trust the maker to post the whole thing to the blockchain and earn his fee therebye.
* If the taker's (trusting the maker) take the fee option, the taker can request the maker to re-sign the transaction with additional inputs and outputs (effectively extending the transaction) 
Takers have many options in this system. They can pair with a single maker, and pay no additional fee's. The taker can also separately deposit trust funding with one or more makers and combine them into a multiple maker pool. (gathering all info at the ioauth stage to form the TX)
Also, makers may offer to include a full or partial refund of trust deposits in the final transaction in a chain ( which encourages takers to complete the transaction) 
As usual, the full details and final form/scripting of the TXions must be rigid and compliant, with no tricky options.

The joinmarket protocol is fundamentally flawed, and the implementation is poor with none of the logic in unit testable form.

Probably best to send it back to them as a refund, or else send it to an exchange or otherwise quarantine the coin; the worst thing you can do is mix it with your wallet, as that will deanonymize the rest of it.

the biggest question about open dimes will be: "how do i know this is a real open-dime, and not a fake look-alike with no private key inside"
30 million pounds of sterling silver is quite enough metal to afford to counterfeit it. It is most likely not worth the effort to counterfeit a 20 mbtc opendime. So only holding small denominations is their first line of defense.
Secondly, it would be nice if each device held some form of factory certificate with a hard to duplicate property such that it would be difficult to simply clone. index.htm from a valid open dime could simply be cloned onto a counterfeit one, and i dont see an easy way to prevent that.

Well, its the only blockchain that is actually being used to capacity. The alts/others are vastly lower scale and mainly occupied by speculators, whales, and scammers - they do not have an economy yet or they would be facing the exact same issues.


txn times are the same as ever; its always been the same if you pay prevailing rates. Freebies are low fee transactions take longer, but that is not surprising, nor is it an expected feature of a popular blockchain. Those transactions must be off-chain, in any real blockchain.


Fee's are what people choose to pay; they can only go as high as people find value. 
For example: they guy complaining that he would have to pay ~90 dollars worth of btc to move 71 odd transactions: well the fact that he is up $7200 worth of value over the last 4 weeks (at a bare minimum) is a big part of the reason why.

@_date: 2017-06-20 11:38:18


fair point; assuming forking happens that early and not after the first locked in block. 


Not necessarily; it could become an etc/eth type fork at that point, incentivizing collaborative mining on both sides. you are assuming one fork is an existential threat to the other.


It does affect it; because it becomes more of a zombie that wont die. Even a much smaller pool of miners could keep the chain alive at that point, while it would potentially become more interesting to legitimate miners. The attacker would have to deal with it rising from the ashes continuously.

As soon as anyone else mines a block their lead is cut, and they either have to flip the rollback or bite it and start over. They would need nearly 100% of mining power for this situation, and the cost would be quite high even if successful; and no matter what in the end it helps because re-targeting death is shortened or avoided completely.

I dont disagree with your logic; if there are willing to keep pushing their empty chain indefinitely, they will eventually catch up. But if they stop to take a breather its impractical.


this has still moved the chain forward 100 blocks, and with even a minor variation in results could mean 100 real blocks instead of 100 empty ones. The attacker has also lost the value of that mining effort other than the block reward, so it is not  cheap venture. 
The advantage of asicboost would help significantly, but does not help on a bip148 branch which makes it impossible


unless they have an extreme advantage is has power, they have to run full time and not just on demand. Other miners would have to be so discouraged as to give up completely; and before retargetting.
The death of the chain would realize the full cost to the attacker, as all those block rewards would truly become worthless. (indeed those block rewards are a hefty bribe to simply mine collaboratively instead of destructively)
I dont think it is a practical attack unless the attack has an overwhelming amount of hashpower (closer to 100 than 51% ) and is willing to take any loss. Once a retarget is hit, then reviving the chain becomes progressively easier, so a true deathblow could only come if an impossibly high wall was set by a full tilt attacker.
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:04:41


This is not and has never been something that bitcoin is designed to do. Please read the whitepaper and look at the design; its a currency system for high value settlements.
This never sunk in with many people; even maximalists. If you want small change cash and microtransactions, that is going to be a level 2 thing. Non-monetary transactions, and small transactions less than ~100$ values are just spam, and should be expensive on L1. The whole planet does not need to know about your coffee purchase. If the value keeps going up, it may become $1000 for mainnet (while the dollar still has any meaning)


I dont know, how much should it cost to memorialize shuffling a 5 dollar bill around your own pockets with the largest supercomputer ever built? 


Segwit will make tumbling have a decent financial incentive; and much better possible implementations of it as well. Segwit also enables the types of L2's that can let you play with $5 without having to send extremely expensive spam around the planet.
