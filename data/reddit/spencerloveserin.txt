I think Bitcoin is the world currency of the future. South Korea has been at the cutting edge of technology for a long time now. South Korean and its companies have benefitted greatly from free trade and capitalism. Without the market based economy, free trade, and capitalism, South Korea would look like North Korea.
North Korea would ban bitcoin. So why does South Korea want to be more like North Korea? Bitcoin = Freedom

Freshly acquired 0.00769232 BTC! Bought $100.00 at $13,000 on the dip!

Wow! I can’t believe that we’re back under $13,000 thanks to South Korea police raiding exchanges and creating a bill to ban all digital currencies!
I’d love to buy at 10k, but 12k is good too!

I did the exact same thing... and I keep kicking myself for it now.

I hope the auction takes place at the bottom of a downturn so the government gets little for their confiscated property.

I learned about bitcoin either in late 2009 or early 2010. I was interested in obtaining bitcoin at the time, but there wasn’t really a way to buy it except from someone who has already been mining it. I tried solo mining it on my own PC but after leaving my PC on overnight my wallet just stayed at 0 bitcoin. So, I gave up. Maybe a year later I saw people selling bitcoin on eBay and considered buying it. But, the liberty dollar guy recently was arrested so I was scared of owning any. I really thought that it was illegal. Either way, I thought it was really cool and did tons of research about Bitcoin. Anyway, at the time I was just finishing up college. Looking for a job with no professional experience and a 4 year degree during the summer of 2011 was difficult for me. I was struggling just to buy gas and ramen while living with my grandmother so spending even 10 dollars on bitcoin at the time seemed like a waste. Especially since there was no real way to cash out. Since then I’ve had a bunch of jobs, been promoted three times and now have a well paying IT job. I bought a house somewhere in there, too. So I finally have some extra cash. It wasn’t until recently that people started asking me if I have heard of this thing called bitcoin and I’m like oh yeah I forgot about that. I’m now a hodler after about 8 years of being on the side lines. I don’t feel bad about missing the wave, I was busy with life. Of course having that nice job 9 years ago and being able to afford to invest in bitcoin would have been nice too.

Nobody can time the market. Trying to time the market is just speculation.
If you put all of your money into any particular asset as a lump sum, you might lose 70% of your money in a month and that will hurt. Just look at the people who invested at $19,000. It must have hurt a lot when Bitcoin hit $6,000.
The best method to enter a very volatile market such as Bitcoin is to buy into your position incrementally. This is called Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA).
If you were to have bought $10,000 at the height of the market back in 12/1/2013 at $1,200 per Bitcoin, you wouldn't see that $10,000 again until 3/2/2017 which is over three years later. However, if you were to split that 10,000 up over the course of that time, buying on the first of the month indiscriminate of the price you would have $30,000 at the end of that period.

I tried to send from GDAX to a bc1 address and Coinbase is still telling me it's an invalid address.  Maybe they're still having some issues?

Dollar cost averaging is a better strategy than any of the options in the poll because it allows you to buy more bitcoin when the price is low and less bitcoin when the price is high. 
Recently I’ve downloaded the historical price data from yahoo finance. In excel I played around with the numbers for dollar cost averaging and I learned that if you were to put $500 into bitcoin on the first of every month over the past five years you would be a millionaire today.

Bad idea. Buy only what you can afford to lose.
Watching the price of your Bitcoin holdings fall when you don't have any debt to pay off feels much better than worrying about if you're going to be able to repay that loan.

Essentially yes. 
Past performance doesn’t necessarily indicate identical performance in the future but sadly that’s the best thing that we have to go on. 
If future performance at all mimics historical performance then it is reasonable to assume that $30,000 in bitcoin today equals $1 million in bitcoin in five years. 
One word of caution: if you were to invest $30,000 of your money today and it and expected to be equal to $1 million in five years you might not be so lucky. For example if you were to invest $30,000 at the peak bitcoin price of $1000 in 2013 it would have taken you 2 to 3 more years to recover back to your original $30,000 because the price of bitcoin did not return to $1000 until 2017.

My favorite line is "this doesn't mean cryptocurrencies are useless. Buying drugs, money laundering: these are situations where they can come in handy".
