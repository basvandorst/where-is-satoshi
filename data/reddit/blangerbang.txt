They are very much like the astroturfing going on before the election. They're the of crypto.  
Which is funny, because they started calling that so that they can "beat us" before we figure it out. It's very obvious where the astroturfing is coming from...

With infinite nodes, infinite bitcoin.  
It's more interesting how many nodes per ms you can traverse. When the exchanges are online and sending to each other we will see the true worth of LN when one node is sending continuously to another. Will they have large amounts on LN, or open and close every few minutes new channels? Who knows, but it will be really damn interesting how they will use it.  
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:02:15
Funny how random posts like this are very very pro-bcash all of a sudden. It's like theres someone with a lot of accounts upvoting strange bitcoin-bashing comments and downvoting bcash-bashing comments. HMMMMM

Except bitcoin is proven, for 9 years.
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:44:32
This doesnt mean anything. The only way for it to be decentralised is if every node has a channel to every other node?  
If a large NODE grouping is disconnected because they are stupidly just connected to one single node (so they would be useless as a routing node) they could be disconnected. SO WHAT.  
If you cut a swathe through the middle of a network your gonna have 2 networks, it just takes one channel opening to fix that and the odds are this will never happen when you have 10s of thousand of nodes, thered have to be some surgical strike going on.  
  
Take your FUD and throw it on some other upvote farmed shitpost please

Then use litecoin for your daily coffee? bcash is a scam and is trying to damage the crypto market for their own reasons.  
LN is coming, then you can use your bitcoin for gum or whatever small tx youre so eager to make.

Yes  
what of it?  
The whole concept of HODL is that you cant beat the system unless you invest 20 hours per day into following what is essentially penny stocks so reading EVERYTHING and trying to squeeze out earnings every day.  
It's a lost cause, so HODL and be happy you get something.
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:39:36
I'm pretty sure that they knew the starting price during the first dump would be low before they invested in their upvote farms to spread FUD. So they probably exchanged a sizeable chunk of btc to bch the first days. That's why they want to pump it. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:40:48

Yawn... no one is buying your fud dude
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:35:26
The idea is that Cost is supposed to stop the spammers, they can spam all they want but they will run out of money sooner or later. It has shown that they did run out, it just took a while since they have their own miners to recoup parts of the losses.  
There are other attack vectors, LN is the next target just you wait.

No, if you hang out here a lot youll notice a sudden push for a specifik agenda. Someone posts on "bitcoin is failing due to &lt;reasons&gt; and theyre saying its because of segwit LULZ (HIGH ENERGY MAGA)" then they all come here with the same copy paste comments.

@_date: 2018-01-20 08:58:54
Just because the exchange deals in crypto it doesnt mean theyre safe from legal repercussions. They are located in the US and fraud is illegal while dealing with anything, be it pokemon cards/stamps/crypto.

@_date: 2018-01-19 18:01:56
So if the size of the data is lower, what would that mean? Would it mean less work? If every transaction would be less work, would it be faster or slower? Would that have a joined effect perhaps?

I just hope that people will have time to get out. I'm all for the coming dump to happen soon, but so many unknowing people will get burned bad... Ver and his cronies will see it coming early and exit, when the run on coinbase happens it will be too late :(

@_date: 2018-01-26 12:37:07
If Bcash wasnt forked and instead created their own alt coin without the FUD and underhanded tactics it would be worth nothing. The market cap in bcash is just a parasite on bitcoin and i think many are just sitting on the forks because they cant be bothered to dump it anyway, so the market value is way off until people bother with it.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:54:37
LN is to keep the most decentralized and secure cryptocurrency viable even for buy a piece of gum, while still competing with Fiat payment methods like cash and debit cards that have high costs.  
  
If you want to use a more centralized currency youre welcome to do so, go buy one at your closest exchange and hope the chinese miners dont fuck your wealth up suddenly.
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:15:13
That's bitcoin, not LN. Imagine 7 billion people doing daily transactions on eth or btrash without a 2nd layer :D  
If "just" 1 billion people use LN on bitcoin daily we're in a pretty good place.

Whats your goalpost here?

No not really. The only people risking their actual money here is the people that know what they are doing and they are taking the risk.  
It's not normal people putting their salaries into channels to buy coffee, these are developers and early adopters.  
I can imagine if they find a bug that Might compromise even one satoshi that the bcash propaganda machine will have a field day either way - doesnt matter if its on test- or mainnet.

@_date: 2018-01-31 14:49:55
Well. Forking the code and making your own is definitely not inherently a scam.  
Forking the blockchain and trying to make your own version with peoples ownership in a different way is not inherently a scam, but its hell of a lot more scammy than the first option.  
At least try to make a coin that does something different. Just another secure store of value with fast anonymous transactions is redundant at this point.  
Forking the code is what open source is, not creating a copy of peoples stake and tagging it with a new name to pretend it also has value.

There is no centralization in LN and Segwits does not in any way weaken security, but it's nice to see the FUD attacks are still going strong! Go back to your containment sub please
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:01:13
Coinbase is an american company, so... yea?  
Businesses are not outside the law just because they use crypto
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:21:24
Hello again troll. You keep talking about this and we keep telling you about segwit and LN and schnorr and and and. And you keep saying the same words over and over.  
Go away
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:05:15
Too bad lightning needs segwit which will practically empty the mempool just by itself with enough adoption. but naaaaaaaah lets just throw wronlgly guessed numbers around and hope bcash sells better right?  
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:57:55
He's just here to "spread the word" dont mind him

The brigaders are just here to create doubt, fear, uncertainty. Perhaps theres an acronym for it hmmm :D  
No seriously, r btc looks exactly like r t_d, i wouldnt be shocked to see a [HIGH ENERGY!] tag soon. I would tell you to not waste your time, but i guess its all we can do...

Hello fellow intellectual: 
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:13:47
Youre writing this in a thread where someone is paying through torguard. Dude... 
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:56:59
Yea youre not making any sense so... cya!
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:32:59
Well, even that can be disputed.  
Some of the shittier coins are created and transactions are faked internally, so their own miners just swap between ghost wallets making it seem like theres liquidity And a high marketcap. When in reality theres just a thousand poor saps investing their real money and the starters sit on 40 zillion fakebucks
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:51:45
The size is an issue in the future, but bcash is currently happily promoting that it "can" use 1gig blocks as if it's a good thing. One system tries to stem centralization and the other is trying to promote it, who would you follow? Ohwait :D
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:26:43
The world is a big place
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:19:47
your fud is showing. you can do transactions for a dollar now, get with the times.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:25:54
People DO pay for credit card transactions. You just dont see it.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:57:31
Ok ;)
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:59:37
That's exactly what we've been talking about. We try to force coinbase and every wallet to adopt segwit, but theres an ongoing brigade (you included) trying to stop people from making btc scaleable. If people dont update their software, why are you complaining to the developers instead of to the users?
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:31:57


Wat? Sure doing it all on LN will be cheaper ofc, but currently LN requires segwit to be implemented so... 
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:17:29
Get salty for being corrected? *Check!*
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:57:30
Sorry, not wasting my time with you
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:10:18
Batching transactions through a channel would be cheaper and faster than doing separate outputs for every transaction. Talking about cold/hot wallets and exchanges is kinda moot, they dont copy their keys manually from a paper wallet every time they send money to someone. If its automated, they have a "hot" wallet.  
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:30:00
why the hell are you using coinbase lol
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:45:43
the whole reason you troll is to ask "relevant" questions that you can keep asking questions about. As soon as someone gives you facts you will answer with "but it will not work because &lt;copy paste lie  Youre just happy i gave you an irrelevant attack vector to use.  
Youre a concern troll, we all understand what you and your like do.  
I could copy paste the link for you to read, but you will just keep asking questions, you dont want to learn because youre a troll. Just give up no one cares

@_date: 2018-01-30 13:09:34
100mb blocks are definitely not feasible. You cant trust a coin that is only stored by data centers. And bcash would be stored on alibaba.  
I would not trust my money to chinese miners having &gt;90% nodes.  
"Surely you dont need the whole Full chain to operate a node" No, but you cant trust a Full chain owned by 1 party.

@_date: 2018-01-30 15:59:25

So keep your money in the channel and buy pizza/coffee/rent/lambos for a year? And it will be cheap because there will be 1/1000th amount of transactions in the mempool :D  
But oh wait you dont like to listen, just troll... sorry
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:09:49

Passive aggressive comments on reddit?! Well i never!
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:53:49
The transaction fee questions were a brigaded effort trying to push bch. They stopped paying them so the "questions" stopped, easily explained.
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:02:22
jfc that guy lol.

Bcash is also broken, nothing on it works and the fees are up to $40 for each transaction! yes its true because its on the internet right? :D
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:33:59
Wait you dont even understand how to FUD correctly? You just write words that you heard on that other sub? lol
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:13:43
Transactions are not at ATH levels?! OH MY GOD IT'S DOWN 20% SINCE THE DECEMBER CRAZE HOLY SHIT DEAD COIN DEAD COIN /s
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:51:32
That's with 10% segwit adoption. with 50%+ adoption there wont be a mempool. Havent you been paying attention? We've been talking about this for a year now...  
Ohwait perhaps youre not here to learn, oops
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:41:40
Perhaps he doesnt sleep and trolls on 50 accounts all night? actually he has that crazy look 
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:40:28
With 100% adoption fees would be minimal, together with LN they would be infinitesimal
@_date: 2018-01-27 09:25:04
Which was the 43k likes post? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:45:02
Market caps are imaginary. They dont hold up if someone starts selling, its a really dumb metric.

10k in fees!? thats nuts

As btc goes higher, the smaller wallets will be worth to transfer out of again.  
Though if someone is creating 1 satoshi wallets....
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:54:04
lol no its not about transactions, they couldnt care less. They want their copy that they have invested heavily in to skyrocket so they can dump back to btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:53:25
Buy stocks instead, i heard they are great for retaining value until it all goes to shit. just pay 2.5% brokerage for inflated magic parts of a company!  
*edit* first: if you have an account on coinbase, youre an idiot. second: tell them you want them to implement segwit. guess what, they like the $20 fee because its free money because they bulk their transactions anyway

We're already under heavy transaction spam attacks. quadrupling the size would be disastrous.  
It works great on coins with 1k transactions per day though, have fun with that.

@_date: 2017-12-20 08:53:04
The astroturfing IN THIS THREAD is blatant and obvious. It's an attack and they are succeeding because the mods dont do anything about brigades or paid for comments.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:39:10
with segwit and LN, why is there a need for BCH at all? it has no purpose other than try to make some people rich.    
Blocksize increase can come when btc is safe from spam attacks THAT ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. imagine if btc had 8mb blocks now, it'd be a shitfest
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:06:39
It's called insider trading and is very much illegal with normal securities and currencies. But we'll see how much can be pinned to the culprits when all is said and done...  
And seeing how coinbases own code hickuped and presented an imaginary hard coded number i think someone has something to answer for..

@_date: 2017-12-22 23:03:14
thousands of small and cheap transactions. you can see people sending the same money back and forth and doing weird cancellations.  
bch doesnt have that problem since they have 1k transactions per day, btc has topped 500k. no idea how many are real transactions...

It's not brigading, its paid for astroturfing. On youtube, reddit, twitter, everywhere. It's a concerted attack.

Youre mistaken. BCH wants segwit and lightning network and they will take it when it's tested on BTC.  
At the same time theyre saying its shit and terrible... but the real people behind it knows size increase doesnt help at all. There is no reason for bch to exist other than split the user base and try to make a quick buck.

dont buy your groceries with bitcoin idiot
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:36:06
This all feels like a paid for attack by astroturfing. They're all using the exact same buzzwords "I'm selling my btc and going all in the real bitcoin (bch)!" youtube comments are full of them. It's the same pattern you see from putinbots and trumpets.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:47:10
Dude, there's never been a Trump in office before. If you believe for a second that another president even comes close to the shit he's been spewing youre sadly brainwashed beyond recognition.  
You think it's all lies? They're reporting what he's saying, what he's writing himself on twitter. It's not even reporting anymore its just regurgitating the inane babbling from a retarded baby.  
I'm over 40, but i'm not from north america. We see the same shit in the US now thats been coming from third world county leaders in africa and SEA, it's fucking hilarious.  
Your country is turning into a soundbite, a joke. A dangerous joke that might unite every country against you, but still a joke.  
Next election everything will be turned back to normal when democrats win in a landslide because you've alienated the whole GOP from people. Great job flushing an entire nation there ol chap.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:26:15

You are blinded by roger ver, or you are a sockpuppet. It's very clear in your posts. Why would i spend time dealing with you?  
I have done my research and found the whole mess repugnant, so i cannot fathom how a sane person can come to any other conclusion.  
Believing that you can fix bitcoin by increasing block size, fighting blockchain at every turn, trying to take over even the name bitcoin, all of these things are repugnant and not how this revolution will pan out. Centralizing is not the way to go, and believing that bch is not centralized is just insane.  
and then I ASK MYSELF why do i spend time here WHEN YOU ARE A CONCERN TROLL THATS ONLY POINT IS TO TRY TO MAKE PEOPLE QUESTION THE FACTS.  
You are responding EXACTLY how you should, which shows that you have training. good work there sockpuppet. Are you actually also russian? that'd be hilarious

When bitcoin explodes again, this time through adoption with LN it might require a hard fork of a block size adjustment. But it will come naturally as the blocks are filled with real transactions instead of non-segwit non-batched exchange dust movements.

He could sell 1 million btc for bitcoin cash and do the flippening in one night. It would probably devastate bitcoin and set it back to 2016 price range and raise bch to the skies.

The 51% attack is only dangerous for a few actors. The exchanges or serious whales. I guess it could affect the price due to exchanges dying because they are non observant to how the attacks are done, but no one will double spend when theyre buying a car from you or something.  
BTG dropped 10% and then came back up again. No one really cares about double spends.  
But i guess someone could figure out more dangerous 51% attack vectors. Probably change the difficulty or something i dunno :D

Read this thread then, its got a lot of great answers. Or are you just CONCERNED?
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:02:24
The only reason bcash exists is because of the type of asic miners that "some" people were heavily invested in couldnt use their full potential with segwit activated. Therefore they went through this whole charade to try and stop it.  
Now i think it's just Vers psychosis keeping it up
@_date: 2018-05-30 06:45:29
You are stating it's centralized. Show us who has &gt;51% hashpower please.  
Are you talking about the pools? Pools dont really own the consensus of their miners, they just share the bitcoin received.

BCH proudly announces that they want 1gb blocks on their chain and that it could use it.  
Just running 32mb blocks at 10min intervalls would run you 4+ gigs per day. Not impossible but after 10 years youd have a 14240 gig blockchain. If it was 14+ TB today bitcoin wouldnt have the adoption it has today.

Bitcoin has 12k nodes today and it's increasing. DDosing that many high bandwidth points is very very very hard and expensive.

If he sold firecrackers it would have been fine, he sold explosives that were powerful enough to kill and maim, thats why he served jail time. You dont get jail time for selling firecrackers...

Ah, youre one of those guys :D

and now its fricken 30%. crazy
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:10:41
He'd have to change the bitcoin price daily to keep it current. Just like exporters and importers change their prices depending on the failing usd :)  
Bitching about him "taking advantage to profit" has no place in a real discussion about this, he's accepting bitcoin and how the price is calculated is up to him.

you have a lot of anger, did you see the infowars debate by any chance?
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:51:18
Bitpay forces exorbitant transaction fees, conbase will do the same to keep their weirdly 200+ sat/byte transactions to feed their miner pals. fuckem
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:46:06
More stable than +-20%. Do you even know what you're talking about or are you just here to share nonsensical questions with no forethought? Are you just annoyed about something? 
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:40:14
If you go to /btc youll notice the similarities to that sub and T_D, its frighteningly similar.  
All theyre touting now is how their little snowflake community is under attack by the ~~hillary~~ blockstream cronies. So many fake 1 day accounts in there its silly
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:03:33
Yes, this is totally relevant to the bitcoin discussion. Great job

Could it be that you are showing *CONCERN* over the volume?! Are you VERY CONCERNED. HEY GUYS SOMEONE IS CONCERNED OVER HERE!  
Dude, no one is buying your trolling
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:22:07
It's worth the alibaba servers + some asic boost for the time needed to obliterate it...  
The second you can short bch on a major platform it might happen.
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:23:38
Nice try concern troll

Dont try to explain btc to a nocoiner.. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:35:30
Same amount of utxos as the end of december so...  
But people seldom understand that, transactions is the wrong word for what you people are counting.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:15:50
I think youre mistaking btc for bch.  
Otherwise, please show a heatmap of hash rate?  
@_date: 2018-02-28 08:10:35
He finally noticed that the flippening wont happen and he made alot from the pump he did for the alex jones show. So now he's just using it to siphon his money out.  
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:39:23
no, you cant say that all pools are chinese. 
You have a similar list for bch? :D

Using credit cards at all is a terrible idea. Buying crypto with a cc is just insane.

They already are. Most of their mining is owned by the same dude, they can hard fork at the drop of a dime and get 90%+ adoption immediately

down 4% in a day, down 16% compared to btc in a week, down 40% since 3 months...   
*edit* sorry im not being coherent :) i mean, trade it for btc fast and keep it there for the bull run and sell at 8
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:59:47
Someone just threw in &gt;10 mil in the pot and pushed it from 8.7k to 9.2k.

It doesnt cost that much if you have a lot of miners yourself.  
Especially since youll be getting the money for the increase of cost for everyone else.

You mean spread false news from a russian vpn? 
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:15:26
Yea but he's probably low on the salary scale in the russian bunker, he's barely legible
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:26:14
Also its Transactions, not translations. Bet you read it wrong :D
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:54:55
If they get enough donations with bitcoin they might make their own wallets and infrastructure for it instead of relying on coinbase.  
Did you donate fiat? I went with bitcoin, way easier than pulling out my cc ;)
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:45:55
Its amazing that he didnt have any of his shills call in. They totally dropped the ball on that one.  
I mean they seriously create an account per day and have a daily "Oh i tried using bitcoin today but it was slow and expensive" story on the front page.
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:31:29
dude go back to your containment sub the_donald
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:27:31
What does conversion from usd have to do with this? You're paying in btc, he's receiving btc. Why does the price origin matter?  
If you're talking about bitcoin price stability, selling bitcoin memoribilia isnt going to anchor anything. Complain to mcdonalds and starbucks that they are not showing prices in bitcoin yet.
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:18:17
Since you're spreading fud on every thread you visit, im not so sure you want to see demand for BTC increase...  
Link outputs instead of mislabeled "transactions" instead. 
 
It's down 12%, since the spam attacks.

my  
god  
so much potential there!
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:38:44
That makes absolutely zero sense, that's just using fiat
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:34:31
If lightning doesnt solve it, that means billions of people are using bitcoin and are opening/closing channels. I think we're good for a few months before that happens.
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:52:17
"usually the party you pay to (when buying) pays the fee" yea, thats you paying the fee also...

Apparently it was an alt-righter that in a comment earlier issued a death threat, they really dont like twitter since all the russian troll accounts got banned :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:18:06
Imagine what it would have looked like if they started making asic boost chips :D
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:09:30
Lol are you actually doing counter-troll trolling? The government put up an agency to react to the russian trolling and you think theyre the ones trolling.  
That's Hilarious

@_date: 2018-02-13 12:23:44
its called more hodling, price goes up because theres more people wanting to buy than sell.  
btc is not like an altcoin that can be manipulated as easily as trading with yourself a few $100k, that obvious manipulation is the homestead of bch
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:11:58
Well you havent done any death threats yet so...

Why are people suddenly trying to make it seem as if theres contention in bitcoin lol. Stop this silly fud brigading
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:09:55
Many terrorist attacks are done through fertilizers, packaging it and calling it "pest control" doesnt really help...  
There's a reason you need a license to sell explosives ffs, stop trying to make it seem like he was selling sparklers.  
Again, you dont get prison time for firecrackers.

Someone dumped their 50mil+ because all the buzz about tether and india and the rest of the FUD was scaring people already, so they knew it would have the desired effect. Then they waited for the ball to hit ~7k and bought it all back as fast as they could.  
Now the people that sold are sitting there wondering where their money went.  
@_date: 2018-07-30 21:30:40
Went from a hardline bch opponent to a proponent. It's really no big deal, who cares about a webpage.
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:04:50
Ok cya
@_date: 2018-04-11 07:50:39
It is not misleading, it's illegal to create explosives with fertilizer and sell it.
@_date: 2018-04-18 20:17:29
It's called being a libertarian. If you can buy it, its "free" game.
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:50:50
I really hope so.  
Before i had faith in bitcoin i was terrified of a drop. Now im praying since i didnt buy enough at 6k, hopefully i have the balls when it drops past 6k this time.
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:36:14
There's actually been a few rollbacks in certain alt coins... 
@_date: 2018-04-09 08:11:00

See how dumb you sound?
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:44:13
Except it isnt  
Why would i use another coin to use bitcoin, doesnt make any sense except for pump and dumpers
@_date: 2018-04-24 11:40:49
They have another hard fork coming. It's a pump and dump, make sure you sell at least the day before the fork.
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:25:49
Someone is right now trying to pump it past 0.1. Let's see how much money they lose :D

He probably dumped them immediately

I buy and use it when i get the chance somewhere. I actively seek out businesses accepting bitcoin when travelling, its a fun side adventure almost :)  
But i'm holding, not cashing out but instead using it. Hopefully some day ill buy bigger items...

He was "dealing in explosives without a license". Calling them fireworks in a wiki page doesnt mean shit, he was selling fertilizer explosives. You know theres a reason youre not allowed to do that, ie it's what terrorists use
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:46:05
People/businesses should change their adress as often as possible to avoid analysis of your wallets. You can still be tracked if someone wants to, but its harder.  
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:21:04
Sadly, without the /s youre just one of the daily concern trolls that havent been weeded out yet.

I mean, it's up as in not suspended anymore. Someone got lucky with a bot perhaps? Now it's apparently Russian.
