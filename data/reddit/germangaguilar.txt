Well, I think you were quite lucky

Btc owners don't want to use it as a currency. They have fiat money for that, quite easier to use as form of payment.

That's true, actually, as an economist, I take in consideration some really ugly scenarios for the future, and btc could be so important in those. But still, nowadays, btc ain't the best choice as currency, nor as a store of value.

Dude, you can't call 'just noise' what we've seen the last days. And if it was noise, well, it was Metallica playing Battery in the greatest amp set the world has ever seen.

Assuming girls will like fat guys someday, and that fat will actually prove to be healthy, let's have pizza for dinner tonight.

And terrain wouldn't even be my choice. There are stocks that will probably outperform inflation, and they are far more liquid than terrain or btc.

But people demand terrain because they need it. Noone needs btc at all, for anything. Its value is... 0.

Well, you can buy diamonds, terrain or another stuff to use it as a store of value. And it would make sense, cause those things are scarce, and their price is based on its value. Btc is... Just some hype.

It would be the knee

It could be an S-curve if people were starting to use it. They're not, they're just buying it because of its increasing price. It's obviously a bubble.

As I say in another comment, I actually find it interesting. I'm not an expert in technology, but I have some knowledge about monetary systems, and the factors that make a currency valuable. If government doesn't support it... It's not a currency.
