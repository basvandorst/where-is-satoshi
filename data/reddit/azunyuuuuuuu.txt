This actually is a really smart idea to put addresses as gravatar generated avatars.

Which was fixed within a few hours after being discovered thanks to being open source. Remember Sasser? It took a while until that was actually forced by Microsoft to be patched (patch already existed for a few months but was not forced through Windows Update IIRC)

You mean the concept of a Stand Alone Complex?

Germany, same bank transfers also need to be instant.

Yep, pretty much this. Bitcoin can only be anonymous if you are unable to trace the coins in the blockchain. As Bitcoin relies on being able to trace the coins to properly do the transactions we can safely assume that it is pseudonymous. That does not mean you have no anonymity at all as it is very hard to figure out which address belongs to who.

Probably the same way you can take down YouTube videos and accounts by mass reporting them. Things get immediately pulled and reviewed manually.

That was not typical in germany a few years ago and could take a few days (!) to complete, but now we have SEPA which defines very high requirements for banks to actually transfer the money instantly.

Appearantly, and somewhat expected if you ask me. Too bad I am at work so I could not get my bitcoins to an exchange to make profit off of this :/

Normal behaviour. This could change as soon as the next readjustment is being made which automatically happens after a certain amount of mined blocks.

I use Deutsche Bank in Germany and I did not have any problems. And yes OP, just drop Sparkasse and switch to a more competent bank.

You can focus on that? Impressive, and also smart.
