I haven't been using my mtgox account for a while anyway, but if it got moved to coinlab I think I would probably close it. Mark said that users would have to approve their account transfer.. if coinlab wasn't counting on that they weren't paying attention imo.

I haven't, but they never allowed directly buying BTC - you always had to buy SLL first and then convert it. Their website still appears to allow buying SLL with paypal and it still quotes an SLL/BTC exchange rate, so I assume it's still working.

sure.. or setup a fake bitpay store or whatever.. should work just fine.

This isssue has already been solved somehow. Prepaid debit cards allow cash withdrawls from ATMs. That is a type of irreversible transaction.. payments to bitcoin exchanges are no different than that. I guess that for bitcoin the key lies in making sure that account logins are as secure as possible and making sure that the initial account application isn't fraudulent... sure that may not be easy, but it's no different than the problem that companies opening prepaid debit card or even just regular credit card accounts already face.

use  - buy SLL using paypal and then convert it to BTC.

well i can't see many people wanting to use their exchange after this.. their work as a bitcoin company is now officially over.. if they continue at all it will be like the SCO Linux thing.

It should work fine.. the problem with wire transfers is the intermediary banks take fees.. it can add up.. you might be looking at $50 for the transfer although it could be less.

There have been a few attempts.. bitcurex has one with the words "me love bitcoin" written on it  and okpay.com is still up and running.

This could be quite cool - however, I think what most people really want is an account that's connected to their local payment system. 
Wiring money to Panama isn't going to be any cheaper than just wiring it to mtgox in Japan and would be far more expensive than say dwolla. Many prepaid debit cards have made agreements with banks in the US and the UK to allow their cardholders to have local bank accounts attached to the card. I think copying this model is the way forward.. while it's cool to have a bitcoin friendly bank and it could be a useful piece of glue to hold together the bitcoin ecosystem I'm not really convinced of the use case for your typical bitcoin user.. 
Anyone could open a bank account with say bzwbk.pl - which seems to be one of the preferred banks for e-currency and crypto currency exchanges.. if your goal is to just be another bzwbk.pl then great.. but if you're trying to service end users rather than exchanges I'm not really seeing why people would need an account in Panama - what they really need is local payment accounts that have some way to make irreversible payments out of them to other people for p2p or to exchanges. 
That way they can transfer in money from their main account for free or maybe even have their paycheck sent there and then forward the money via an irreversible payment (maybe have a market for exchange vouchers built into the online banking as well as p2p payments between customers). If they had to wire money to Panama to get started I don't really see the benefit over existing methods - moreover as soon as someone does setup a system to do what I describe using local accounts your business model would be obsolete.
