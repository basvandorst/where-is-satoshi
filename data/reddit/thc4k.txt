You can definitely use the blockchain to store any kind of data, and there is no way to remove the data or prevent you from adding data, this is the point of the blockchain after all. 
However it's not like you get image files when you download the blockchain, you have to take very specific parts and decode them in a very specific manner to get the stored messages. So even if you store something illegal on the blockchain, the algorithm to extract this data would be illegal, not the blockchain itself.

Yeah I imagine the original draft was just "Cya suckers!" so they really came a long way.

Algorithm is just a very broad term, there are plenty programs that are  illegal because they do illegal stuff. It just makes a lot more sense than declaring any sequence of bytes illegal.

I'm in it for the drama. Drama every day.

Just another example:


How can they be still around after years? Shit like this makes my head hurt. It seems to me that Bitcoin "investors" have this mass delusion about this currency of the virtual world that they completely forgot how the real world works. Got some money? Better send it to places you've never been, where laws you don't know apply, to people you can't hold responsible - and still expect to get filthy rich.

Well, it's not really fair to say that the 400 milion were lost in one day, because this shit has been going on for 2 weeks now. And obviously MtGox wasn't a Ponzi scheme, it just died from good old negligence. Still, you're absolutely right to put the numbers in perspective.

Oh god this is gold. Don't rage too hard, it's not good for your health. I take no responsibility!
At least you figured out why Ross will spend the rest of his live in jail: He didn't give a shit about what happened to his customers and thought "nobody can stop me". Turns out he was wrong.

Any medication that can potentially kill you needs to be prescribed by a professional and anyone selling it to you without a prescription would be held responsible. Deadly drugs are illegal exactly because they are not save under any circumstance. 
Six people are dead because they ordered drugs from Silk Road, and arguing that they should have read some disclaimer is just cynical.

Profiting from drug dealers selling Heroin and LSD to kids is not immoral?
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:47:57
Do you really think buying Heroin is as easy as "trolling the streets", especially for some kid? All they needed to get on Silk Road was the name, Google, and the ability to follow the user guide. 
Silk Road made drugs easier to get, and because the shit they sold on the site did actually kill people, Silk Road is partly responsible for the death of at least those 6 and probably many more.

I totally agree that completely baseless claims are the source of most topics on Buttcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 17:19:14
Perfect example for the kind of logic Buttcoiners make fun of.

I think this is far from over. We haven't truly reached the bottom before the network is collapsing and a lot of miners have gone bankrupt :-/

The [Willy Report]( has pretty strong evidence.

At least the technology is interesting. It's not like people just throw money at this uncontrolled experiment, right?
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:45:23
I don't think everyone is aware of the ridiculous size of that fiasco: Starting back in April 2013 "someone" at MtGox pumped motherfucking **110 million USD** they didn't have into the system. That was the last time we had a honest market price for Bitcoin. We really have not the slightest idea where bitcoin really stands.

I hope you're trolling. They've been hacked and they scam people regulary. No audits and no accountability. No reason to believe its anything but a running scam.

I mean for the market value of bitcoin is doesn't matter where all that money came from or if it ever existed in the first place. It influenced the price, and now it's gone (and didn't just move to another exchange). Let the courts figure out the details. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:14:56
We don't even have to argue about that, because it doesn't matter who controlled the account. It only matters that they disappeared with MtGox. Apparently nobody has hundreds of millions of dollars just to buy bitcoins with, so the price goes back to where it was before the whole operation started.

I guess you can still charge him with money laundering or the good old tax evasion.
@_date: 2015-04-20 10:25:45
This is an analogy why Bitcoin can have any value at all. Bitcoin can be used to transmit value, if people see value in that, then there is value in Bitcoin. Otherwise Bitcoin would be just some numbers in a distributed database. It doesn't explain anything about Bitcoin itself.
