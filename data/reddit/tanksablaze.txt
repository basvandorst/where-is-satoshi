55 upvotes in 2 hours with no comments, that feels incredibly.... false.

Some people liked the idea of the alert system just some very shady people got a hold of keys. 
I suppose it could be one tiny piece of evidence that someone really was Satoshi, but as well know that is something that is impossible to *prove*

If he was okay with huge server farms as nodes and miners in the future I don't think anyone can argue he expected every common person with no technical knowledge to be able to willing to run either. 
Then are you asking if the generation tx (which has the 'coinbase reward') is included in the hashed list of txs? It is.

How does this differ from the[ Coursera]( curriculum or [free info for his bitcoin course at a community college?](
Is this the information that have been previously available or is this something new?
@_date: 2016-09-14 00:04:43
The argument I have seen time and time again is that small nodes with pitiful connections should all be able to run a full node.
Personally from what I have read in the whitepaper and from reading everything Satoshi wrote, I don't think this is how btc was designed. This opinion has really only been seen in the last year so I thin kit's mostly newcomers who have come to this conclusion.
I think it's silly to hurt the whole so some far extremities can still play. I think it's the people who care more about making a profit that is driving this, as everyone I talk to about it that is in favor of the idea doesn't seem to have a strong grasp of the system or it's history.

But forks are an integral part of the design.
Don't like what the developers are doing? Fork it. That's bitcoin's motto

...But they did hide the 'buy bitcoin' button, they were 'moving away from it' in the public's view...

I thought we were a fun community that liked all good crypto news, if this subreddit can't mention stuff like this then it does me no good

But logically, seg-wit destroys bitcoin as outlines in the whitepaper and replaces it with a separate system that is different but some people still want to call Bitcoin. Much like mumblewimble and schhoor sigs, it may be good but to say it is not a fundamental change is wrong. 
Also considering that the functionality of btc was to have a data cap larger than average use, the lack of maintenance is in effect a change; which also changes the fundamental design of bitcoin.
So depending on it you think bitcoin is what is described in the whitepaper then yes, seg-wit destorys btc the same as not increasing throughput. 
@_date: 2016-10-19 22:19:42
they don't want seg-wit and LN to be the only scaling solution? So they want to keep the original vision of btc, and that makes them anti-btc how?
@_date: 2016-10-28 21:58:55
1) that means nothing
2) no one said he was
3) what exactly are you talking about?
As I see it your comment had nothing of value. It offered no insight of facts or even a hint at any explanation of why you made such a worthless post. 
@_date: 2016-10-19 22:16:33


really , any proof at all, whatsoever, like even a glimmer of a source or citation? No? didn't think so.

Yes a divide and conquer approach it seems, but who is really behind it I wonder? The funding and contunial attacks seem to come from the 1MB is too big crowd, they are who I would suspect.
No one who understands the history of btc would view BU as a threat.
Really though isn't it far more logical to co-opt current devs? Look at the actions by the btc mods over the past year; if there is a concerted effort to destory btc then it is coming from inside *this* subreddit
@_date: 2016-10-10 22:33:23
But...  if the limit is *not* increased then no more people can start using it.
It is simple in that either bitcoin can have no more new users, or the current users need to leave or stop using it. we are not allowing new users, and some people don't seem to have nay problem with that
@_date: 2016-10-14 22:43:37


Do you have any hard data or numbers to support this opinion/view-point?
I would be happy to see real data and actual numbers instead of everyone's opinion. 
@_date: 2016-10-28 22:21:33
Put your money down, so far the prediction market/betting is on a hard fork 
there are dozens of more bets on the subject
@_date: 2016-10-13 21:49:35
Do you have a source for that? Historically when the data cap was well above the block size fees were still paid, with many more users the number of fees would grow.
So either more users with current fees or the same or less users with higher fees?
@_date: 2016-10-05 23:42:38
Perhaps that is why Satoshi envisioned only large data centers being nodes. When miners were full nodes and miners I know but I don't think that detracts from the arguemtn at all that bitcoin was simply not designed to be run on the home computers of most people
@_date: 2016-10-19 22:18:44
What is to learn? Satoshi described that the code and BC could be forked if needed; the etc/etf sp[lit seems like just what he described, maybe you're just a pussy about risks but btc was kind of deisnged to keep near moore's law in terms of ability, have you tried reading anythig SN wrote, like the whitepaper?
@_date: 2016-10-11 21:53:17
Well.. SEP251k or whatever it is called *does* use a prime  but it is a small  only; though I agree with your comment
@_date: 2016-10-19 22:14:27
Read the btc whitepaper, that is the design BU wants. read seg-wit, it is a fundamentally different system, it may be good but it *is* very different. If anything is an altcoin here, a seg-wir fork is the altcoin simply becuase it is more different than the original design of btc
@_date: 2016-10-28 16:00:00


What if everyone upgrades?




related to this that I jsut read  


where is the data to support this? All I see here is your opinion with no data to back it up


I mean isn't that obvious? Everything I have read indicated Satoshi planned for btc to *be able* to hard fork when needed, which is could do as a minority and start a 'alt-chain' or it could do as a majopirty and force the previous establishment into being the alt-coin
We just don't know how this would work out in the future with btc, the two chains could survive in different niches, the total price could go up, it could all go down, there are too many variable to say anythign as fact and trygin to do so is a bit dishonest IMO

Is this related to Carl Mark Force VI's ~few hundred thousand dollar deal (with paramount?) to sell his rights to the story?

Didn't they at that same time suggest people move to Microsoft's bitlocker? IIRC people took it as a false canary at the time, to not trust the whole message

For people who know the history about how the 1MB data cap was added as a temporary anti-spam measure and Satoshi implied and describes how it would be increased (whenever hit, do blocks would never remain full). This would be fine, except the fundamental functionality of Bitcoin *is* being changed by not acting to maintain the system.
From my point of view, as someone aware of the history, this quotation denounces some of the Core devs for their inaction on keeping btc as it was and instead letting it become some alt-coin bearing the name of Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-10-19 22:24:59
hmm if I am a new user what is worse, waiting 10 minutes on average, but I know that ahead of time; OR waiting 10 minutes to 18 hours, and I have no idea when it will work and I might have to readjust it later and if I do someone else will have their tx not work.
Please Greg, if you want to create an alt-coin that is different than bitcoin via the very fundamental ideas (I.e. bitcoin should never have always full blocks, your alt-coin want to have often full blocks), just admit it like a real man.

That doesn't address my point does it? I am saying if all nodes upgrade and no old version are left are those old coins spendable?


which I think we can see in the whitepaper, and seg wit and shoor and other things that break that core design are clearly not what was in the whitepaper, that doesn't make them bad but to say they represent the core design of bitcoin is just a lie
I'm sorry, you are just posting more of your *opinion* that are as I seem completely unsubstantiated, as  I asked for evidence and you said you don't need any I will continue to see your opinions as only that until I see *data* to back up with logic and facts the assertions you claim to be true
Please, don't repeat your baseless opinions, show me data.

I can show your user history and it clearly shows you acting immature and fueling flamwars.  
Logically, anyone in your position could have done any number of things to improve relations, communication, of the community yet we see you continuing to be disrespectful, namecalling, acting immature, and in general being rude.
If someone *didn't* want to be in this mess, they would not act like you do.
