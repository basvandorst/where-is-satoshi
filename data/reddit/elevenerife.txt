Indeed. If at some point during those five years you've spent any time reading [monevator.com]( you'll probably want to come back and tip me four satoshi so I can buy a beer! Cheers!
Edit: I've just followed the link to check it works and hilariously the article on the front page of monevator today is about bitcoin. I've been reading it for many years and it's helped my sort my (conventional) financial life out.

It is yours but in the pension you've chosen to receive it gross of tax (or not opted out from receiving gross). You haven't paid income tax on it. Opt out and pay tax then do what you want with it.
I find the UK tax regime to be pretty good, especially as a higher rate taxpayer getting 40% relief. And the ISA annual limit is £20000, much higher than the sheltered accounts of many other countries.


Probably 58 if you're young and that will go up. Plan and act now.


State pension not until 68. Plan and act now. 


Equities are generally understood to beat this over retirement timescales and (depending on risk of sequence of returns) you can do well in drawdown while leaving much still invested. 


That number is for cash per institution I think. Works differently for equities etc.
You've wasted your time typing this, fella. Unjerk your knees and do some more research.
