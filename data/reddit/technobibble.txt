I think they are currently doing all they can if the given situation is truthful, I think it would be good to just take that for now... Innocent until proven guilty and all that.

I really don't know how people fall for it, It just astonishes me.
When investing funds you should at least do your research and not get hooked up on fake promises. See what other people have to say and make sure you find a few reviews. GAW have fanboys out there posting rubbish about how great they are....
we will see though. It shows though, GAW started with hardware miners, realised they were losing that battle, moves on to cloud mining, starting to lose that battle, brought out their own coin.... which will be a quick battle lost.. what next?
I think we should start taking bets into what business GAW will Ponzi next. I personally think they will go back to hardware miners and try and start the loop all over again.
And finally... even if this isnt a Ponzi (which we know it is) Josh has spoke soooo much absolute utter uber shite and lied to soooo many people... he cannot be trusted anyway.
Sorry, Rant over. Just dont invest in them.

Not sure, would be interesting to find out though due to it being a possible flaw in coins in general, Obviously due to the amount of Bitcoin nodes this would not be possible with Bitcoin or would at least take tremendous effort. If this "theory" was to work.

Would this be the case though due to the merkle being the same and all the network params. 
I know obviously main.h has a 
* static const int64 MAX_MONEY = 2000000000 * COIN;
But wouldn't extra coins just ruin the network anyway. Without the need for posting this on exchanges?

Wow, just looked into paycoin... why do people fall for this bollocks.




thats 72,000,000$ Yes thats 72 Million Dollars @ $6 per coin. Is he just sitting on this?

I think you missunderstand my point and as someone who uploads his wallet with funds in for people to try and crack.... he obviously is fucking retarded. anyone in their right mind would not.

Of course its brave, Having assets that are secured by an encryption protocol that may one day be broken?
I remember when MD5 was supposedly secure.......
Saying that, I would imaging its a multisig.

Some good question there, all of which I think should be asked.
@_date: 2015-01-03 13:48:02
Looks good, Where abouts in UK are you based?

This is interesting but still very stupid imo, Every encryption we have ever had is meant to of been "safe", They have always found a way around it.
I do believe that it is near impossible to crack a private key by conventional methods but I am sure they will find a way one day and having a copy of your wallet.dat lying about on someone else's computer, some server or even cached somewhere is a very silly mistake unless he plans to remove his Bitcoin one day.
I think Bitcoin will be around for a long time and he will most likely have forgot about this site, while he still uses the same wallet and same address then one day his funds will be gone.

thats a shame, any idea when Armory will be bringing out an update?
@_date: 2015-01-03 10:30:02
Same sentence I laughed at, funny stuff!
@_date: 2015-01-03 12:48:00
Good Call.

Of course, but what I am getting at is this is the biggest scam coin ever.
The market will never be that deep as its a huge pre-mine. but he is obviously selling the pre-mine for more than with his "hashstaker" scam. 
GAW must be worth a Ponzi Fortune
