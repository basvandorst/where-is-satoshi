Absolutely right. I've done some rough analysis on this effect and I believe "real inflation" is between 5% and 8% every year.
To summarize another way: every year goods become easier to produce (they drop in value). However, we also pay more for them on average every year because currency's value is dropping faster than their value. By my estimates, goods become 3-5% easier to produce every year due to technological improvement. That is in addition to the 2-3% we pay more for them.
This "real inflation" is roughly in line with the amount currency is debased worldwide (how much money is printed) compared to the growth of the world's population (which is slower than current debasement).
This "real inflation" is also roughly in line with how much the stock market goes up every year.

They are talking capital flows not market cap. Right now the Bitcoin market cap goes up about $10-$50 for every dollar that flows in (ie usd-btc buy orders executed). If several trillion dollars flow into Bitcoin that means they expect a market cap in the tens or even low hundreds of trillions.

Won't happen that fast because of capital controls. They can and will block exchanges from USD networks if it comes to it. All this AML talk from mnuchin is because they know there could be a bank run to Bitcoin. Soon they will have controls in place to control a mass exodus from the dollar. These controls will get tyranical before they get relaxed. I'm betting it will be illegal to directly own Bitcoin in the west.

The problem we are now seeing is that "debt is good regardless of whether it can be paid or not" is not true in a world where debt and investments are globally competitive markets. Countries defaulting on their debts are becoming wastelands. They are defaulting on their debts because this easy money being created all over the world is leaving its home market and going to the safest possible places to invest, currently mostly to the US. Other countries are madly trying to put in place capital controls to prevent this exodus, but they can't stop it now.
Its a race to the bottom that is ultimately being paid for by devaluing the savings of normal working people all over the world. Those people don't even understand what is happening, which is the crime of it. Eventually keen or greedy people will catch on and opt into crypto. Governments already see this crypto exodus and are implementing capital controls, but they can't stop it long term because the only other option for a lot of these people is enforced poverty.

A winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, Paul Krugman wrote in 1998, “The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in ‘Metcalfe’s law’—which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants—becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.”

Him and his berkshire buddy have been in interviews saying highly inflammatory things about bitcoin. "Rat poison" is one of the things his buddy called bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-08 05:46:52
Yes. This is ultimately why Bitcoin has appreciated so much. Its not Bitcoin causing the inflation, it is the money supply of fiat. The actual money supply growth is a lot higher than CPI\-type inflation indicators. My estimate is actual inflation has been around 8&amp; per year for the past 60 years. This is why stock prices have gone up so consistently. Bitcoin being a new extremely liquid, extremely low cost, deflationary asset class is seeing bleed off from all this inflation.
Here is a graph of world money supply: [
While other asset classes can be controlled by governments to prevent hyperinflation, bitcoin can't, so bitcoin's price will increasingly have an effect on devaluing fiat. That will force governments to either reduce money supply expansion or face hyperinflation. Of course, governments will see it easier to try to put huge penalties on bitcoin use, but as they implement more restrictions, as we've seen in China, Venezuela, Nigeria, and Iran, bitcoin just becomes even more expensive in that country, which has the effect of further devaluing fiat.
As long as we don't have one world government, and there are some small islands with their own financial laws, Bitcoin will thrive and be the future. Fiat will increasingly have more value being burned for heat than for buying things.

Actually, gold is valuable for that very reason: it is easier to store and transfer.
Before the technology where gold had other uses was invented (electronics, metallurgy, thermal system etc), its only uses were decoration and value storage. Before machines,having something light to store value was especially important because you had to carry it physically on your body. This is also why money and jewelry are intrinsically linked: because storing money on something you wear added utility to it in an age where storing wealth was risky. Jewelry became less important as banks were created, and gold became less important as fiat was created (it is lighter than gold after all).
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:45:03
You understood my post correctly. A store of value is a solution to a problem most people don't have: having too much money to store in a good way.
The IMF, BIS, and some billionaires like Soros want the XDR (international bank special drawing rights) to be the world currency -- this is documented in interviews and so on. I don't know the truth of it, but there are conspiracy theories that those entities are colluding to try to make the XDR the world currency by removing the USD from international trade. Bitcoin is sort of the anti-one-world-currency. Its more like a 7-billion-person currency to me.

Their maximum margin is 3x leverage, so one can infer its a fairly small market right now really...

I actually had a sentence regarding gold futures that I edited out. I may speak about it later, but there are two reasons I edited it out:
Gold futures are settled predominantly in cash, which impacts gold value, and being settled in cash means they have additional counterparty risk from currency inflation, which makes them non-equivalent to gold.

You bring up an interesting thought. It is likely that people would put gold on exchanges 3000 miles away if they could for nearly free.

To frame this another way, bitcoin itself is actually very secure, it is the systems outside Bitcoin which aren't.

Inflation as tracked by cpi is a poor metric that was designed to hide reality. CPI is based on a basket of consumer goods that in addition to becoming more expensive have also become easier to produce over time. The easier to produce part of that equation means real inflation is actually much higher.. it is roughly cpi times production efficiency growth, or around 6-8% per year. There are many metrics which echo this fact. Stock market growth is really mostly caused by currency devaluation (the stock market started infinitely going up when the usd was removed from the silver standard). The m2 money supply roughly shows the debasement to the usd that creates this inflation.
This way of looking at inflation reveals that people are a tiny fraction as wealthy today than they were 50 years ago.

No it implies contracts have been traded that sum to that value. The total amount of contracts written that havent been closed (ie someone with bitcoin promissing to sell them at a future date) is a different metric called open interest. The contracts written can be traded back and forth and the volume accumulates with each trade. Volume is not an incredibly useful metric because it is so easy and cheap to spoof.

Bitcoin is perfectly rational, has no bias, and requires no trust to work. It has no cost to own, and 1/100th the cost to use. It is completely transparent and does not rely on secrets. Ultimately the entities who use it will benefit from its efficiencies and edge out entities who don't use it.

OK cool, you're reasonable and it IS totally guessing at this point. I'm not strongly for the idea it will be 1M, but I think it has a possibility with some assumptions. It is all because Bitcoin is the lowest cost way to store value, and I'll explain that below.
Bitcoin is very efficient in the sense that it has very little (to no) upkeep cost. When I'm talking about cost, I'm talking about denominations of bitcoins, not in exchange rate to other currencies. There is no other value storage mechanism that has no fixed upkeep cost. Gold requires space and security. Cash has inflation &amp; security costs. Other investments may increase in value over time, but they aren't guaranteed, and those investments DO have fixed costs.
So if you want to put some value in a time capsule for future use, bitcoin theoretically can be the most efficient means of ensuring what you put in is what you get. Theoretically assumes that bitcoin can be exchanged at the same rate to other assets at the later date, which is a big assumption at this point.
However this efficiency is actually a very huge value to bitcoin because really wealthy entities actually pay a metric ton of value away for these fixes costs of storing their wealth. Just how much does it cost to store $100M in gold? Roughly $2M per year if you do it in a cost effective way. Now theoretically lets say you put that same $100M in bitcoin, you could drop the storage cost to roughly $20k for equivalent security (a factor of 1/100th). That's a huge amount of value right there. If more large entities store their wealth in cryptos because of this cost efficiency, its a huge amount of value "sitting" in these limited pools that reduces the amount of crypto being traded to less and less.
Maybe if that happens, and the pool of bitcoin "in circulation" becomes small enough, we may see spikes up to $1M per coin? Who knows. I think its not as far fetched as it sounds. Maybe one day there are enough rich people using it to store their value that there are only 100 bitcoins in circulation for the rest of us and each is worth $1B. IDK if it will happen, but its possible.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:29:46
It really wouldn't though. If everyone suddenly stopped selling Bitcoin and one guy bought a Satoshi for 1 cent we are at that price. Price is a function of the current sellers vs buyers pools. It has nothing to do with long term value of Bitcoin or other markets.
If the number of people who hodl increases, buyers would continue to outnumber sellers and the pool of buyable BTC would continue to shrink increasing it's value. We don't know what price BTC will climb to but I think it is roughly an exponent of net cash inflows. We are at roughly $30B currently to get the current price.

The US will recover in that scenario as long as other countries are hit as hard by the crisis. What would happen is we would print more more money to pay off the guarantees (like TARP). 
"Backed by the full faith and credit of the US government" ultimately means "Backed by the most biggest guns". US Bonds and guarantees ultimately are backed by the fact that the US will fight to maintain its current share of resources in the world.

Debt is arbitrary to the government functioning for the above reason.

The scholars in this thread have told you it's impossible to know. Thats true, but it is possible to know a range of possibilities with probabilities.
Cash inflows are probably the best known variable to correlate with price action because they signal demand, and supply is relatively fixed.
One of the big investment banks said there was only $20B of cash inflows to crypto currency to create an at the time $200B total market cap with $80Bish in bitcoin.
I think given the limited supply to Bitcoin and an increasing number of hodlers, price is exponential to cash inflows. So that is some grounds for prediction.

When I pointed out that there are types of cases you don't work on that don't get due process, you tried to save face by acting like everyone else here is too dumb to understand. Let me let you in on something: we all can see who's the big dumb dumb here.

You still are wrong. The serials on dollars uniquely identify them and can be used to trace any transaction provided they are recorded. The government requires that they are recorded in many instances. This is well documented and non-controversial. You are misinformed and as you said arent even reading what im writing.

Cash loses 6%-8% per year. CPI is buying power of consumer goods, which lose value every year based on productivity improvement. 6%-8% is CPI times productivity improvement, or another way of looking at it is M2 money supply growth.

Dollars are serialized so unless you have laundered the money (getting random serials for your serials) it most definitely can be traced.
Fyi banks are required to log the serials of withdrawls for future law enforcement use

True inflation is CPI times productivity growth. Productivity growth is the measure of how much more efficiently things are made. This is roughly equivalent to money supply growth and growth in the stock market.
In other words the stock market doesnt endlessly go up in value, the dollar endlessly goes down in value.

This would make the majority of people not want to use Bitcoin but it wouldnt do anything to the network itself. Destroying the network is orders of magnitude more difficult than outlawing exchange.

And you never send or recieve with anyone who knows your identity. And you use a proxy, clean your browser identity, send at random times, send to no entities that can be used to infer demographics (buying weed, supporting politics, buying plane tickets). Etc etc etc. There is so much op sec bitcoin doesnt cover, that almost everyone on the network is identifiable to the major governments.

The fundamental reason for Fiat money, which is to incentivize economic growth, is having diminishing returns due to a slowing in technological innovation.
If there are less technological breakthroughs, the only way a society can continue to grow is by competing with other societies. The primary way in which this is occuring is by artificially keeping labor costs low by high inflation (not cpi, but true inflation which is approximately money supply growth or around 8%).
Increasing competitiveness by reducing labor costs has the effect of forcing a population to become more efficient. The population makes purchasing decisions towards products that use less energy to create and distribute. This lowers consumption, so the europeans have created negative interest loans to prop up consumption in key areas.
The effect of all of this is wealth redistribution to the people who have the finances and reputation to afford leverage in asset classes that beat true inflation, such as equities. Its only a matter of time before the wealthy and the poor exist with no middle.
There is no escape because this is the natural order of humanity in between periods of technological breakthroughs. Bitcoin will allow a small minority of people to beat inflation but bitcoin doesnt produce anything so eventually it will only be a means of preserving wealth.

Fractional reserve banking. There is up to 9x the book money than actual money because loaned money can be loaned again. This applies to all banks including retail banks.
But I think the sticker is about how a central bank's job is to create money from thin air. That's what they are there for after all... Creating inflation by debasing the currency to incentive investments that improve economic growth.

Cash settled futures are a negative value to Bitcoin long term. It's much better for Bitcoin if we get derivatives that are settled in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

It doesn't say anything positive. She's asserting that what regulators think is more important than the people, and that crypto has the potential to amplify shocks and may need to be "secured" by authorities. Otherwise she's keeping her cards close to her chest, probably because she knows taking a firm stance against bitcoin is not popular.

Thats just patently false under certain circumstances. If you withdrew a fresh $5 from a bank and i spent that $5 in a restaurant, your identity is tied to the $5 and when the restaurant deposits that money the serial can be used to identify me based on receipts and cctv. There is then provable evidence we made a transaction. Furthermore depending on severity they could arrest either of us since our identities are known and try to get us to flip for a deal.
And as another poster posted the larger the dollar amount, the harder it is to anonymize a cash transaction.
The only surefire way to keep cash relatively anonymous is to only spend laundered money ... That is small denomination cash with many origins. Thats why criminals do it. Cash isnt nearly as anonymous as youre making it to be.

Bitcoin's main value is storing value securely and cheaply. Conventional assets actually have a considerable amount of cost when storing them securely for a long time. Bitcoin has very low cost for storage, especially at large values.
Bitcoin's transfer characteristics are valueable but less so. We already have Paypal. What does Bitcoin do more than that? Its censorship resistant to a degree.
There are other values to bitcoin.

Inflation is measured with indexes liked the Consumer Price Index, which are fundamentally flawed because they don't account for variables independent of the price of goods. For instance, we know corn yield is 6x-8x more per acre than 100 years ago ( which with other improvements that multiply productivity (machines, automation, distribution efficiency) indicates producing end products based on corn should cost an order of magnitude less than 100 years ago. This productivity improvement drastically outpaces the inflation indexes over 100 years, which indicates inflation is actually much higher than these indexes indicate. So in reality the average person is earning a small fraction of real earning power compared to 100 years ago, but doesn't know it because almost all goods also cost significantly less. The assets which have some kind of built-in rarity are the ones going up at the rate of true inflation (gold, stocks, bitcoin)

I think Andreas is a genius and he is right with the caveats that he explains, but I think its very important that cash settled futures do not become the status quo because they are devaluing bitcoin compared with bitcoin settled derivatives. Collateralizing financial assets with bitcoin adds demand to bitcoin, increasing its price.

This is close to the bottom, but the high times are a long way off still. The bull run will start when you start hearing "bitcoin set a new record for the year". That message will start to reach mainstream news after it hits double digit percentages and then the sheep will be back. That will happen by November 2019 at the latest, summer 2019 at the earliest. I'm with OP. Stock up for the next year or two.
