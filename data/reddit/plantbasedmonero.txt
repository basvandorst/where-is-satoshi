Fear of hardforks is part of the systemic problem in the Bitcoin community. There has to be a line drawn:
* **Unplanned** hardforks are bad. This means there was a bug, and an emergency patch needs to be rushed out
* **Plannned** hardforks are good. Software and protocols need to be inevitably updated. Just tell the community that in 3 months, a fork is scheduled and they have until then to update their client or they will lose money.
Now, imagine if Blockstream would have pushed Segwit out as a hardfork, and given 3 months for everyone to update their client. It would have stifled a lot of the incentive that exists today for alternative solutions. Instead, they set an extremely high, almost unreachable target of 95% for softfork, and gave the community **which they themselves divided** almost 18 months to come up with an alternative solution.
Some crypto-currencies (*hint, hint*) have embraced planned hard forks as a necessary way to update and modernize your protocol. 
Keep idolizing that network effect, Blockstream, and one day your golden calf will be slaughtered.

Wait 2 years at 1MB blocksize, and the network effect will be below 50%

Jumping to conclusions that Bitcoin will even be relevant long enough for a **100 MB** blocksize to even become a reality. This would be, what, 5-10 years of organic transaction growth?
The Blockstream group seems to have jumped to a lot of these *conclusions*, at the expense of the end-user.
Also, a simple doubling the blocksize mechanism is not necessary. There are other crypto-currencies out there (*hint, hint*) which define the blocksize as the median size of the last **n** blocks, and penalize any block which is outside of a given interval.
Wouldn't you know it -- crypto-currency developers who actually use computer science fundamentals to create a good solution to the blocksize issue, and develop with the end-user in mind.
TLDR: Blockstream is a joke, and their ineptitude has divided the bitcoin community in two. The network effect is diminishing every day that they remain in "control" of development.

I did the same thing. There was some little python script floating around back then that could go through a re-formatted drive and scrape for the wallets.
And it worked! Truly a great day that was.
