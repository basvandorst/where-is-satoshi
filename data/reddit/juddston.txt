I am new to bitcoin and trying to learn how this market works; can you explain why summers are generally dead?  
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:22:30
I will take a look into it soon, I've got a bit of a busy week (my brother is visiting and we're taking a road trip).  
I would also recommend checking out and researching how it works.

I am new to bitcoin so still testing the waters so to speak.  Got freaked out yesterday and sold my meager holdings for about $60 to my USD wallet on coinbase yesterday during their difficulties.  I got all the confirmations that the sale completed in my BTC wallet and email but no funds ever appeared in my USD wallet.  However, support says that the funds are there and they are working on it; glad it's only $60 and not $600 but it's still a little nervewracking (probably due to my rookiedom).  
@_date: 2016-08-18 12:35:44
Don't get me wrong, I love the idea, I just wish the discount was a little bigger.  It's great to see bitcoin being more useful like this.

Yeah I got up to like 110 or something and then they fell so fast I didn't stand a chance unless they were right on top of me.  
@_date: 2016-08-20 13:04:22
Back when the price dropped after the bitfinex hack I tried to sell the little bitcoin I had on Coinbase (it was about 0.09 btc).  However, the site was having issues and my sale, though it "went through", did not complete.  I talked to support about it as my account showed the BTC gone but no USD anywhere.  They gave me 0.1 btc and then told me that the sale should complete in a few days and to just keep the extra money.  I was really impressed with that response.  Sure enough, a day or so later the sale finally went through and I ended up with an extra .1 btc that I didn't have before.

This isn't quite true; there's lots of well paying work on Mturk lately.  I've been a user there for just 1.5 years and the work has doubled since this time last year.  
I never have issues with Amazon payments either, I'll be paid on the next business day each time I submit (granted this is not as fast as bitcoin).  
@_date: 2016-08-01 01:42:55

@_date: 2016-08-19 15:26:26
If you want to compete with Mturk you're going to have to look into the vast amount of scripts that users have created to make Mturk viable.  For example, I use scripts that auto-search for good HITs based on criteria (pay, requestor review, etc).  Then when a good one pops up, I get a notification.  This takes the time of searching out of Mturk and allows you to make a lot more money.  I also have a script that auto-accepts any HIT I miss in the case that it were to pop back up in the future.  Anyone who is used to the Mturk game is using these scripts to maximize their earnings.  
In order to compete with that, you're going to have to figure out how to make your setup as viable as Mturk and/or convince people that earning pay in BTC is worth more than earning pay in USD.  
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:20:27
I kept trying and was able to sell when the price was around $522 (I had started trying when it was at about $550).  Now I can't get on at all, though.  
@_date: 2016-08-02 02:25:53
I'm in the same boat; most of my investments are spread out over stocks and bonds and have been performing quite well.  I am just starting to look into bitcoin sort of as a side investment and am still in the research and experimentation stage.  I'm not going to pile anything out of my investment portfolios but I don't have any issues putting a little bit of money into bitcoin for fun just to see what happens.  
@_date: 2016-08-01 02:16:46
Makes sense; like I said this is my first summer (first month, really) looking into btc as an investment; it's been exciting so far, even if my holdings are pretty tiny.  Thanks for the info!

I had a sell that was pending for a few days, too.  It wasn't much, just less than .1 btc, but the money disappeared from my wallet yet no funds were deposited to my USD wallet.  I contacted them and it took a few days but they ended up replying today to explain that my sell hit some technical issue that would take until next week to solve.  In the meantime, they refunded me .1 btc and then said when the sale completes later next week to keep the money as a token of their appreciation.  I'm happy with them.

That fee increase was just this year and a lot of people on were pissed off about it.  I'm not sure if it's still a sore spot, but if you could convince mturk workers that your setup will be devoid of such fees while still offering the same types of work/pay (someday) then you might be able to gain some support.  
@_date: 2016-08-28 00:43:23
I would suggest looking further into Circle; it's very handy.  Switch to BTC mode and it's no different than Coinbase, really, except a bit cheaper fee-wise.  
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:31:08
They had a bunch of issues yesterday with their website; I don't believe any of them were related to security but perhaps they are just still trying to play catchup?
@_date: 2016-08-19 14:10:09
This isn't entirely true or at the very least very misleading.  I use Mturk to scrape up some extra spending cash and while those types of worthless tasks do exist, there are also much more lucrative opportunities, namely, academic surveys from undergraduate/graduate students.  
It's true that it'd be easy to join Mturk and get swamped with mindless, worthless tasks but if you do a little research into scripts and get over the learning curve, there is money to be made there.  If I sit down and actually focus then I'll make $20-30 extra per day.  
Here's a dashboard of the earnings I've made fooling around with Mturk over the past [1.5 years](  I'll do it in my spare time when I'm not working or doing other things.  
That all being said, I wish it had an option to pay in btc.  I have it set up now to deposit to Amazon Payments and then to my bank account.  
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:18:24
I'm not sure what their take is, but it's taken as a fee from the requesters in order for them to post the job.  I forget what the fee level is now and don't pay much attention to it, although I know it was just raised in the past year; a lot of people were worried it would kill Mturk but it doesn't seem to have damaged it too much.  
As far as what I make on Mturk, Amazon doesn't take anything directly from my earnings.  If I do a survey for $2 on Mturk then I will receive $2; there is nothing taken out of it (except taxes at the end of the year).  
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:26:14
Great, now I'm scared to look.  Did you get the email from CB that said the money has arrived in your USD wallet?

Many years ago a mysterious being known as Satoshi visited Earth and imparted on us "the bitcoin", which was basically just moon dust.  Those whose who believe now hodl this moon dust and look to some day return it to the moon.  That's why you see so many people saying "To the moon!" on this sub.  
I've said too much. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:55:25
Sounds like just a misunderstanding then.  Personally, I would consider speculation to be a specific type of investment; with high risk and the possibility of a fast, high return.  Either way, good luck to you, thanks for the discussion!
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:45:22
No one can answer this question.  Many here think that long term (years and years) the price of bitcoin will be many, many times higher than it is now.  Although the road to get there tends to be very bumpy.

You can facepalm all you like, but I'm not the one who said something like:


Let's go with your definition of investment:


By that definition, yes, you can invest in gold and hope to sell off at a higher price down the line.  However, when compared to stocks and bonds...
Gold doesn't produce any income in the form of dividends or interest.  You almost always have to pay a premium over spot in order to buy any.  The price is notoriously volatile as it's value is largely correlated with fear and uncertainty.  If you want to acquire any sizable amount you have to worry about storage and/or transport costs.  Even if the famed "end of days" scenario that many goldbugs seem to fantasize over ever shows up, do you think anyone is going to want to lug a heavy metal around?  
Sorry bud, but gold can easily be seen as a terrible investment.  I actually own some precious metals myself but more for the novelty of having some.  They are fine to diversify with and they're even alright as a form of "alternative" saving (though the wild spot price ride makes that risky).  But yeah... I don't expect to make any sizable return off of my holdings, especially in comparison to my stock market shares.  
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:44:22
What a zinger LOL.  
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:43:56
What few people know is that the molecular makeup of a bitcoin is the same as the molecular makeup of moon dust.  Gold is much more plentiful on earth than moon dust, therefore, bitcoin electrons are worth more than gold electrons (at least, here on earth).

Yeah, the situation you just described is not usually that of someone in their mid 20's, presumably out of school, living with his parents without a career of any kind.  
However, I don't want to assume his situation and ultimately the choice is his, but from what he described I just don't think dumping all of his life savings (which are above average for his age) into bitcoin is necessarily wise.  
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:01:23
Is it because you spent $100 CAD?  Possibly the offer was $100 USD?  I referred my friend with Coinbase and got the $10 in BTC within an hour or so and he spent $100 USD.  I think that maybe it's cumulative, so perhaps you need to fill the gap to get your bonus?

Piggybacking on this comment I tried to sell about $50 worth of bitcoin last summer during a price fall (I was somewhat of a dumb noob).  Coinbase suffered one of their "outages" which seems to get everyone thinking conspiracy and my sell order got canceled.  
I contacted support and within a couple days they sent me the money for the sale at the sale price AND refunded me the BTC that I sold AND sent me a little BTC "tip" for my troubles.  
Coinbase is alright in my book!
@_date: 2017-01-10 00:52:20
Mine too, I wondered what the deal was with that.  
@_date: 2017-01-01 14:55:15


10k is a lot of money and would be a big deal to lose, especially to a young kid with no job.  The sentiment above tends to suggest that at your age you haven't really realized the value of money.  With the amount you currently have saved I would bet you have a leg up on 90% of people your age; that's an opportunity that shouldn't be taken for granted.  Invest some into bitcoin, sure, but in my opinion bitcoin should just be a portion of your financial portfolio.  Start an emergency fund and keep it liquid, invest in the stock market and hodl some bitcoin, but don't throw it all in.  But that's just my opinion, obviously.  The decision is yours to make, so good luck with whatever you choose!

The markets aren't pricing in a Trump win, they are doing poorly because they don't know what will happen.  All along now investors have priced in a Clinton victory but the FBI re-opening the email thing cast that into potential doubt.  She is still favored; if she wins look for a stock market jump on Nov. 9th or 12th as investors breathe a sigh of relief.  If Trump does win, expect the stock market to plunge, possibly up to 10-15% over the next couple weeks.

I see your point, but what you're missing is that some people may use bitcoin differently than you and what they do with their bitcoin, why and/or when isn't really anyone's business but theirs.

Great idea for a thread!  
I'm new to bitcoin and still learning a lot but what strikes me is simply how mysterious it is to your average person, especially the core concepts of the blockchain.  I think the key to having people jump on board is to simply explain the blockchain in terms that your every day person can understand.  Illustrations of the blockchain and how it accounts for/keeps records of all transactions publicly and why this is beneficial to all users of bitcoin would be the most helpful, at least to folks like me who are still learning this technology.

Last year in June of 2016 I was just getting into bitcoin when I tried to sell 0.1 btc on Coinbase when Coinbase went down.  My sale was dead in the water and a large price drop followed. Coinbase support refunded me both my .1 btc plus the money for the sale when it finally went through a week or so later.  At the time it was about 50 bucks but now...

If there's something I want or need to buy online that I see accepts bitcoin I'll usually just buy whatever amount of bitcoin I need (plus a little extra) and then buy it with that.  That way I don't touch my holdings (maybe even add a little).  A lot of the times the price for bitcoin is less than the price for credit card etc, even.

You pay short or long term capital gains tax on any gains your bitcoin realizes if you sell the coin for USD or use it to purchase something.  If your btc increases in value to 50 USD and you spend it on some item then you will be taxed on the $20 gain.
