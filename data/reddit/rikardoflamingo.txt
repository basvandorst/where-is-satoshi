The Donald certainly knows a thing or two about macro economics, I wouldn’t be surprised if he even knows 3 things.
Hodl USD until it moons guys.

Futures market seems pointless- hasn’t really affected day to day volatility.
Sell/buy walls - that’s where the action is.

There is a strong parallel with Tulip mania!
Read the Wikipedia article, it states that the story of tulip mania is drawn from very little actual evidence. These people who make these statements are also drawing from very little actual evidence, just their own confirmation bias.
Hitchens razor; that which is asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.
Cringe? Nope.

Give us a synopsis there my brother, just for those amongst us who may not be able to parse that kind of thing in they heads.

Unreservedly agree. Grow up cunts.
Also we should not measure the success of the thing that will kill fiat currency by its value in fiat currencies. 
But that’s just me maybe.

It’s all a matter of perspective mate. You deny climate cahange for your reasons. It s not doom and gloom. Glaciers are disappearing. Didn’t say anything about that relating to sea level.
Please maintain your viewpoint with your self confessed lack of evidence. 
This is not the right sub anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:56:46
Because one little country decides to trade futures, like other countries have for ages? 
Cool story bro.

Linking bitcoin to terrorism is how they will regulate it. Americans don’t believe in rational shit like science and reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:10:47
Yes climates change, the fact that it is changing so rapidly at the moment can only be attributed to increased green house gas levels in the atmosphere. The highest it’s been in millions of years.
Look at how fast glaciers are retreating - this isn’t a natural oscillation of a system in equilibrium. 
Look at the increased strength and frequency of hurricanes in the US. Not part of a natural cycle.
The evidence is all around you.
The financial cost of doing nothing will be far greater.

It's good to challenge mob mentality. Something is going on. There are dark forces in play.
Bubble is not the right word though, this is a new unregulated asset class finding its equilibrium - needs new vocabulary.

Seriously man, I'm not an expert, just a humble hodler, if you have some expertise to share, that's what we're here for.  Share away.

r/btc are religious fanatics. No rational arguments to be found there.
They justify bch value by comments being censored on this sub, if you can believe that.
Sure btc has issues and is deficient in many areas, but bch solves nothing that isn’t solved by other alt coins.

Why do you tards always bring it back to government spending, wasted funding etc. somethings are worth more than mere money.

Nzbcx are not taking any more sign ups for now. 
Kiwi-coin looks good, bit of hassle to sign up as it uses real me.
Independent reserve in AU can work, but getting fiat back to NZ accounts looks tricky, have not tried.

OK, that makes sense. So what's everyone worried about then? Yet another bollox flavoured shit coin.

Let’s be clear on what Facebook actually is - an Ad platform with a LOT of data on its audience.
Having a means of making transactions on this platform gives Facebook MORE data. 
Data around what it’s users buy and how much they spend and on what is beyond valuable.
Crypto bandwagon jumping is just opportunistic.
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:02:57
I am skeptical and hopeful in equal measure, I think you make a fair observation about this sub. It would be good if there was a place to air concerns without being labelled as shit coin trolls or tulip fanciers.

I thought consensus was built around longest chain?  You think exchanges will swallow all the sell off volume?

I have used often, with no issue. I think there is a lot more activity on this exchange lately.

View the comments on this sub from 2 months, 12 months, 3 years ago. Same questions then, same answer now. If you want BTC buy some.

At this stage it's still a speculative investment, only buy what you can afford to loose. Ignore the price fluctuations, it will go down. It will go up, by how much and when is unknown.
My experience has been 'should have bought more' and having skin in the game makes you focus and learn quick. Make mistakes with small amounts.
Don't keep your coins on exchanges if you are not trading

What other meaningless metrics can we attribute to bitcoin, 100% stain resistant, water proof to 100 metres. Gets 330 miles to the gallon.
