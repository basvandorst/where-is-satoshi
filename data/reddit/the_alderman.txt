The more it drops under 10, the more people who bought in at 5/6/7 etc will sell and call it a day.
I know I'm stating the obvious 
10 is definitely a psychological trigger point.

Depends where you bought at.

Also looking for cash

I see. Haven't wanted to buy for a while
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:15:32

pulling this out my ass but it will keep going down to 5 or 6 then bounce back up to 10 or 11 .
I've lost half my money up to now though over the last couple of months so why listen to me.

Have spent a few hours now watching GDAX and seeing a familiar Herringbone reversal pattern.
The price is going to change over the next few hours.  Trust me.

It's gonna tickle 10ks balls and then somethings gonna happen.
Also no clue here

Does it rise every now and again just to make the schleps think it reached the bottom and start buying before the next dumparonny?
Starting to think this is all orchestrated somehow....

At this point I figure Bitcoin is kinda like sex.
As soon as I think I've figured out the rhythm it changes on me.
That and it costs me 100 bucks a night......
