There are a few videos on YouTube (but in Arabic).. I will comment with a couple links in a bit.
There’s even a cleric who always talks about it enthusiastically all the time it shows on his face, haha!

Who the fuck are these people and how much weight do they have in the eyes of Muslims?! LOL

This is a video of Shiekh Al-Fawzan (one of those real deal shiekhs in Saudi) talking about bitcoin.. Do you know of any Windows or Mac apps that would let me add subtitles?

PM me and I’ll send you my number.

Don’t your government’s “leaders” dictate what you can and cannot do? You’re in as deep of a shit hole as they are but you refuse to acknowledge it. (Not embracing religious control, but just taking the rosy glasses off your eyes)

It serves as a confirmation, leading to institutional and state adoption.

Displaying bitcoin prices among Gold and Crude oil is intentional (in my opinion) especially with the wave of Saudi media encouraging people to diversify income and not only rely on jobs (unemployment crisis).. the clerics talking in favor of Cryptos is also great.. it all works in favor of the almighty Bitcoin!

I can tell from the influx of group members on my whatsapp groups and from Arabic news coverages of Bitcoin that "this is just the beginning".. Massive amounts of $$$ is coming into Bitcoin.. 2018 will be more spectacular than 2017! Just wait...

Thanks.. I removed it

Western governments are worse.  That aside, not all Muslims obey whatever Islamic laws get thrown at them. Not all Muslims believe in uniform ideas. But still, you’re not free to do whatever you please in a western society even when it’s completely ethical.

I am moderating 4 Arabic Whatsapp groups (230+ unique members each, mostly from GCC countries) for Crypto trading, mining, and news. People here are buying cryptos like crazy. Especially that all Muslim clerics announced trading crypto's is completely fine according to Islam. lol

Thanks, I'll work on it, post it on YouTube, and start another thread ;)

This is Shaikh Saleh Al Fawzan:

Thanks, I’ll do the video subtitles now!
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:51:47
lol :D

Ok, I’m getting the idea now.
So these orders will NOT affect the market..
What happened today was not a BTC buy order for cash.. 
What caused the spike today? 
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:47:28
What about placing the order and having it executed? Is it all done in 1 order or multiple orders? (As the price will change just by filling half a million or a million)..
What are some of those OTC vendors that sell such amounts?
