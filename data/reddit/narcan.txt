Because this time people lost 50% of what they put in.
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:16:48
Means that now though , regardless of if it started like that 
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:45:49
and people wonder why it's called a bubble
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:08:59
Yeah , it’s going way down lol
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:14:48
Mooning days are over for the long term holds
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:18:56
Yeah, none of it makes any sense 
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:20:56
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:53:49
Mate, it's going down in value. I wouldn't buy more lol.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:27:39
Dip ? Nowhere close to the bottom of this dip unfortunately 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:59:14
But what about in 4 weeks time ?
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:10:00
Yes, good to know those days are behind us of unpredictable dips. Great time to invest.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:32:22
Yep a loan! Just got approval :) 
I think with all that’s gone on in the last couple weeks, hard to see how it would drop down again. Most are saying it will double again in the next year, so time to make some money !!
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:05:36
You should sell , it’s only going to get lower 
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:02:08
How much ?
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:53:39
Run an app on your computer that can create USD. Once you have generated enough (say $1000 USD) then use a bitcoin exchange to convert that to BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:55:26
Yeah with the amount I'll make on this loan will be easy to pay back :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:24:51
There’s no way I’d upload my identity docs, they’re currently a huge target for identity theft 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:27:17
People just like to make up their own interpretations of the market. It really has no basis in what’s happening.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:02:28
Crash has just started , it’s going down hard
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:06:27
lol, can't see how it can go down at this point mate.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:00:44
Alt coin purchases with BTC aren’t a taxable event in majority of countries. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:28:35
It’s ok, no one is doing this. Ignore these accountants. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:01:26
I’m inspired by your post and have just applied for 60k !! I only make around $50 a year so that’s why I’m doing a bit less but this is a crazy and cool idea. Excited �� 
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:05:27
But it will be worth heaps soon
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:53:29
Do it, Android phones are the gold standard when it comes to mining. Anyone saying no is just trying to get you out of the market for their own gain.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:58:06
Nah sorry mate, think it's just going to go down a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:24:03
Thanks, I'm trying hard over here. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:32:58
Yeah great that’s what I’m hoping :) 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:10:23
Yeah but BTC can’t be really used for anything 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:42:53
Yes, I did that 4 years ago and now have roughly 900,000
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:27:43
Well clearly not them, but a lot of people bought over 10k.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:58:57
I’m down 350k mate, 600 lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:11:25
Do you want to hear a story about all the sticks that don’t go back up ?
