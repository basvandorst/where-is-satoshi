There are several ips bound to the VPS. One node per IP.
@_date: 2014-07-11 18:43:14
I tried to reboot the vps this morning however it never came back online. I raised a support ticket on the portal however there hasn't been a response yet.
I tried to start the server from the control panel however it mentions that the operation could not be completed.
Thank you.
@_date: 2014-07-05 21:21:14
Thank you, this seems pretty cool.
I'd like to start off hosting a dedicated node. From there, i'd like to use the vps as a sandbox and see what I can come up with.

Please forgive me for being short, I'm on my phone. 
The first step would probably be to contact someone from bitpay.com. They should be able to provide the point of sale. I'm 100% sure if they work with restaurants or just e-commerce shops. 
Also check coinmap.org to see what other restaurants in the city are accepting bitcoin. From what I remember, there's A few. It might be a good idea to drop by one to see how they manage bitcoin payments.

I'm not sure if this is coinbase or a problem on sendgrid.com. It looks as though coinbase.com uses sendgrid.com to send marketing emails -

The SPF passes because em.coinbase.com allows sendgrid.

I hope no one falls for this scam... I'm sure a lot of emails were sent out though...
Maybe you guys should send an email to the entire list from SendGrid to delete/ignore the first email.

No I never have before.
2. What do you like about BitQuick?
I love the quick buy/sell options on your site. It's a no-nonsense and very streamlined setup.
3. What do you dislike about BitQuick?
I haven't had time to develop a dislike yet :)
@_date: 2013-09-11 21:28:35
It sounds like your bitcoins were split up into change.
If you received 1 bitcoin from someone, then spent .5 of the bitcoin, it would break the 1 bitcoin into two .5 bitcoins. One goes to the original destination the other goes into your wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:43:53
I don't remember the exact verbage for their hold earlier this week but I believe it mentioned that the buy would be placed at the bitcoin price of today. Not when the order was placed.
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:32:21
Buy bitcoin, send to paper wallet that isn't the easiest to grab in a panic. I agree, keeping it out of an easy to move location is key.
@_date: 2013-10-31 13:52:39
Yes. Your private keys for your wallets are all you need.
If you have another secure computer, I suggest you install multibit on it and import some of your private keys.
As you practice moving money around, importing wallets, you will understand more about how bitcoin works :)

That's for the neon sign, it might be too big for what you're looking for.

If you don't want to invest $200 for 1 bitcoin, invest in .1 bitcoin. That's only about $20.

The back button was easier to find than the mute button. I couldn't stand that music.
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:17:57
It's very easy.
In coinbase, just go to Send/Request then click Send Money.
Enter your paper wallet(coldwallet) address and send any amount of bitcoin to it.
If you ever need access to the bitcoins on your paper wallet, coinbase can import the paper wallet's private key.

The paper wallet is all you need. Just import the private key and your bitcoins will be spendable.

Click on the green button showing the currency. It will swap BTC and your local currency every click.

No, it's a free market. All Canadians have the same opportunity to buy bitcoins. If someone wants to sell a bitcoin for $1800 and can sell one, good on them.
They are taking a risk at owning the bitcoin and spending time on selling it.

I submitted a javascript bug report a few months ago. I never received a payout for it :(
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:10:10
Those are your public wallet addresses. You can give those addresses out to receive payments.
Never give out your private key.
You can send your bitcoins to another wallet but you can not retrieve private keys from coinbase. Your best bet would be to create a paper wallet at  then send your coinbase bitcoins there.
One ting to note, you can import the private key from the paper wallet into your coinbase account if you ever want to.

If you're worried about the size of the block chain, download a wallet that doesn't download the blockchain.

1 satoshi = 0.00000001 Bitcoin
or using the example above
500000 satoshi = 0.005 Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:33:37
Yes. Sites like blockchain.info can come and go.
The block chain was around before the blockchain.info website started and it will be around when blockchain.info no longer serving a webpage.
All transactions, regardless of any wallet website, are located in the block chain. If you wish, you can download the entire block chain with a wallet like [bitcoin-qt]( , this way you won't need to rely on blockchain.info or another website.

Create an account on coinbase.com or another exchange if you're not located in the US. You can invest in bitcoin after confirming your bank account, similar to how paypal works.
From there, you can transfer them out to another wallet, spend them, invest them, etc.

Read the sidebar!
Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:27:38
If you're new to bitcoins, you're much better off investing your money into buying bitcoins than mining for bitcoins.
I hate to deter your you from mining but currently the hardware for mining will cost more money than the bitcoins you will receive back from mining.
If you want to mine, your best bet would be to look into the ASICMiner Block Erupters. They are fairly cheap now and it offers a low barrier of entry.

There's always dangers with dealing with money online. I suggest to setup two factor authentication in coinbase or verify your phone number. This step alone removes a lot of the danger of someone else logging into your account.
Aside from that, I've been using coinbase successfully for the past 5-6 months and I haven't had any issues.
Check the subreddit for more information. Here's the documentation on it - 
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:36:40
If you sent the bitcoins to a wallet address where you control the private key, your bitcoin will always be in your possession.
That is why it is so important that you keep your private key safe.

Spend it, save it, and or invest it.
