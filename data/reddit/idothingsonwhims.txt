In the same announcement they said they would make the Bcash available to those who own it due to the fork, and then slowly integrate trading, on what sounded like a schedule. They dumped it all and started trading all at once and the price jumped to 9,000 dollars almost instantly. The price also rose 1,000 the day before the implementation for no apparent reason. Then Roger Ver says "insider trading should be a non-crime". It could have been handled better. Oh, also timed it at a Bitcoin difficulty adjustment, like all the other BCash pumps.

That's actually a Ponzi scheme. A pyramid scheme is where people make money from recruiting more people into the scheme. For an example of what happens when you combine a Ponzi and a pyramid, see BitConnect

Uh ledger Nano S is 70 USD, if you pay more you are overpaying or it is one of the unnecessary bundle packs. Don't buy from eBay

It wasn't just uncles on Thanksgiving buying Bitcoin last year. They accumulated enough to be able to sell at high volume driving down the price before the futures contract expired. Once the futures were announced, it was their plan the whole time

Assuming you have more currency going out than you had before the conversion, you need to be taxed on the additional funds. If the funds don't correlate to the exchange rates of the third currency, you have unexplained income, which is suspicious and could trigger an audit, where they would find your Bitcoin trading activity.

Ok now factor in that the Bitcoin futures are settled in cash, not Bitcoin. How does that change things?

Don't forget that this includes converting (trading) Bitcoin to other crypto currencies as well.

The awesome thing is that Andreas focuses so little on the price that even three year old videos are relevant and informative

A future is a way to invest in a commodity when the price is unstable. In theory, you could settle a futures contract in the thing itself, like Bitcoin, and receive it for a lower price than it actually is at that time. They are tied to a price and a date. If you are wrong about your prediction, you owe money, if you are correct, you are paid. The purchasing of Bitcoin by the people who may have to pay it out is what will raise the price as well as help stabilize the market. That being said, there is no reason that all this "stable" trading will be taking place at the current price, a higher price or a lower price than it is right now

The graph shows decreasing negative profits over time

The fact that the bank transfer takes so long is part of the reason bitcoin is revolutionary. Its pretty funny that you need to wait 7 days to transfer money and then once its converted to bitcoin you start bitching about the fact that its taking a few hours. (not to downplay the legitimate scaling issues and network congestion)

That would be terrifying can we just hit 100k like two years from now or something

They had announced it would happen before Jan 1st... So not NO idea... just no calm logical rollout with a period between the wallet availability and trading, like they said it would be

were you waiting now, or waiting on November 9th when the tweet was posted?
edit: nevermind, I see the website now.

Maybe research more about the technology than what the price does?

It's incredible to me that people don't freak out about the possibility that the US will ban the use of cryptocurrency as a means of exchange, or close the exchanges or something. They can't destroy Bitcoin itself, but they can make it impossible to convert back to Fiat or buy things.

When you need to depend on a distributed network to function, being the biggest, therefore most secure is kind of important. It's not just a brand like Nike, social and network effects matter for more than just recognition.

If I buy a Starbucks with my debit card, the transaction is pending for like three days, but nobody seems to care about that

So that they just see the Bitcoin with cash in the name, and know that Bitcoin is supposed to be digital money, and it's cheaper than the other one and they just buy some

That was terrifying. I'd much rather go back to 1000 gains every month or two please. We can start over at 10k

You probably have to do additional identity verification. At least you do if you are from the US, not sure about everyone else

If there is no inflation then why are prices rising so much in your hellish economic landscape?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:10:37
Right away would have been in August. They said Jan 1st, then released a roadmap recently that didn't include the release, then the price jumps 1000 dollars right before they release it, and jumps several thousand more immediately upon release. Keep in mind, bch had been available to anyone who didn't have their Bitcoin on coinbase already for months. But if coinbase has your Bitcoin, that means you do not control any Bitcoin, all you have is a promissory note from them.

So in theory, if I have a bunch of gains, but I buy $100 worth, then use that to trade, I can say that I made no profit because it was that 100, and not the $100 worth I spent on it in like July... Right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:34:57

Or they are classic pyramid schemes, where the commissions increase the more people you get to sign up. AND you need to pay them in Bitcoin to work for them, without withdrawal rights for months, and receive a shitcoin in return,  aka bitconnect. It's really amazing how transparent it is, I hope we have a deep dive to shake out all the get rich quick scheme altcoins

Well when you create a bank in your proof of work system, it's just more of the same. Coinbase is a bank, and they can do whatever they want with people's money that isn't explicitly illegal.

That is not a taxable event as far as I know. If you convert back to dollars or to another currency, that is taxable. If the converted value is lower than the initial value, you can report it as a loss instead of paying taxes on it.
@_date: 2019-10-29 20:47:09
Ok, true but the scope of the post states " in human history" so we are talking about the nature of the thing, not who is willing to use it near you at this point in time right now. The point is, if you had someone willing to take it, you don't need to exchange it or sell it or go through a middleman, but it is also uniquely and securely under your ownership, so it is both cash and an asset. No, your grocery store doesn't take Bitcoin, but they're much closer to accepting Bitcoin as payment than they are gold bullion or some of your Apple stock.
@_date: 2019-10-29 07:25:40
I think you missed the point that the liquidity doesn't come from being convertible to cash... It *is* cash... But it's also an asset... So it's a liquid asset, as the post says. Liquid just means easily exchangeable, you don't have to sell your Bitcoin, you just exchange it directly for goods and services... sounds a lot like money

This miraculous method needs a name... It's dividing by 100 so it's like the part compared to 100, which in Latin uses cent- so it's like how much relative to the cent, yes that's good the centper method

It's actually unenforced unless you have no activity for like 6 months with no money in it at all, then they'll close it. You can open one with no money at all if you try.

The blockchain implemented in voting would not need to be technological. If you you can have a paper Bitcoin wallet, you can have a paper ballot tied to the blockchain. It would be unforgable and impossible to insert additional unverified votes.

I have a 3 dollar fee from coinbase to send One USD equivalent to my own external wallet. I understand why, and I regret getting deep on coinbase, but the average person is never going to buy bread for an additional  $3 just because it's future money. Shit needs to get better before the hoards really get in, and then slow bleed out because Btcs shit wasnt together yet.
