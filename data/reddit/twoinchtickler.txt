I think it’s probably because it’s a global currency, and most of the world are well aware what the online ramblings of him are worth in terms of consistency. He’ll likely regurgitate something entirely contradictory again in a few tweets after seeing a different report on tv, so he’s not worth basing any long-term decisions on.

I know that China’s currency devaluation ties in nicely with today’s pump, but are there any feelings that the pound completely shitting itself in the event of no deal Brexit could provide another injection? 
Also, have a good day fellow hodlers!

Another volatile day! What’s the biggest variance we’ve ever had in a day, must have been on the way up and down in winter 17?

Thanks, that's a genuinely interesting response :)

Are paper wallets kosher? As in, most of my BTC (I've left a tiny bit on exchange for if it does a December '17 again and I want to quick sell 5%) was transferred to an electrum wallet, I then don't have electrum installed anywhere, but have kept the seed and pass on paper somewhere super top secret. Am I safe (barring me burning the house down)?

You agree with yourself to pop a set amount into bitcoin at certain time intervals - weekly, monthly, whatever feels good to you! It assumes that in the long run, bitcoin will continue to rise (I think that it the history of bitcoin, there’s only been something like 81 days where you’d have made an overall loss assuming you’d bought the same amount every day). In essence, it prevents you panic buying or panic selling on ups and downs :)

I really thought we’d see much more of a pullback at 10k, that rise to 11 was ridiculous! Be good to make sure we’re steady here come Monday and hope growth continues without the general public freakout that happened last time. On one hand, people may buy in again having seen it bounce back, but it may be that people who saw others stung last time steer clear... either way, it’s an exciting time for bitcoin again after a pretty grim 2018!

Ha, I told myself I’d forget about the amount I had and only check in here and there... how wrong I was! That being said, if you’ve got the money available and can afford to risk it, then hop on board!

Next stop 10,000GBP!

The optimist in me would say hold on and on, as things are (currently!) looking extremely good. If you’re worried though, you can always sell a portion then decide whether you want to buy back in if it drops in the hope of a subsequent rise, or if the climb continues unabated then buy back in; you’d have less than you would have done otherwise, but if the growth continues it’s still a gain. Just don’t risk money you couldn’t afford to lose.

BitPanda was my entry point for my first bitcoin purchase, way to go guys and gals!

Oh heeeeey rollercoaster guy! What are you doing here again, I thought we discussed this?
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:23:43
It’s not quite the same, but certainly close enough! Thanks!
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:56:47
That's the one! That makes sense why I couldn't find it, and why this looked so similar. Mesmerising to watch when we're on the up....

This looks like it for sure; it’s bugging me because I’m sure this isn’t the site it was on (g-deck feels familiar...) but it looks spot on. Thanks pal!
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:25:33
Hadn’t checked in a few days, and to say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement.... are we 2017ing again?! Because that was a wild ride...
Also, what’s the site people use that shows the candles, and down the left it has all the buy and sell orders and you can see “the walls?” It’s completely gone from my mind and is infuriating me.
