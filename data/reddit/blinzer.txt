sometimes when you play a forward strategy, you're forced to play it until the end even if you know you're going to lose, because it's still your best chance of winning. i live by the sword and die by the sword.

good thing i didn't listen to your fucking dumb ass, otherwise i wouldn't be riding this sweet wave to 10k right now
i hope you shorted

lost 50k buying dips this year because i "believed in bitcoin". any bitcoin millionaires want to help a boy out?

listen, let's say you knew the future and knew bitcoin would return to 20k, but you knew nothing about what would happen in between. for all you know, it could go back to 5 cents before going back up to 20k. or, for all you know, it could do a run and get there within the next week. do you try to take profits on the way and risk missing out on the information you know is going to happen, or do you hold and guarantee yourself a gain of 2.5*(which is what you would get for holding right now). at the end of the day even having the crystal ball doesn't help you, you're risking in either direction. you're risking to miss out just as much as you're risking to lose in the short term, but at the end of the day you're always missing out on something. the only thing you want to do is decide WHAT you want to miss out on, and make the better of the two choices. being greedy is what's going to kill you, not missing out on something. it's like that for anything, it's no different just because it's bitcoin.

i heard about bitcoin for the first time in my life ever in march of 2017. why are you just trying to find something to hate, generalizing and putting me in a category just so you can swing at me?

yeah, the current trend for the past year and a half is "the market does the opposite of what it looks like going to happen", so i'm going to go ahead and follow through with that speculation.

? i don't understand why you're being mean and trying to impose your superiority onto people who showed interest in the thing that you want people to show interest in. losing 50k isn't bad enough, i have to have you come here and try to talk down on me too?
yeah, i guess investing in something and leaving all the people who drove the price up/tried to protect it out to hang is cool. good for you, man. laugh at me! i'm sure you, a veteran, have made millions by now, and you don't give a damn about helping anyone who lost their money.
if watching people fall apart(regardless of whether it was their bad choices or not) is part of being a "vet", i'll stay a rookie forever. i'd rather lose all of my money than lose my heart.

by the time we've "confirmed" that bitcoin has reversed, bitcoin will already be up 80%. ignore these buffoons, either buy because you think it will go up or sell because you think it will go down. don't get the worst of both worlds.
