Why would you be worried that you will be blamed for their own mistake? If anyone dares to do this to me, i would disown that fag from my life striaght away. It's not as if such people makes a huge difference in my life.

That's why i never gave away btcs as gifts. Ps4 games are still the best for stupid people.

Dude you are still so young and it's very important for young people to take huge risk to succeed. Take this oppo to learn a lesson, try something big that might change your life. The upside, your 4.5k might turned into 45k in a few years time, the downside is that you might lose everything instead. So ask yourself this question, are you willing to lose everything? It's a very good learning opp to learn the meaning of "risk" and take responsiblilty for your own actions. Good luck.

Your gf is lucky to be with someone that is smart than wasting time on someone that wastes her time.

He changed his story to "being hacked" after he found out that no friends believed in his stupid story. Lol

What is crypto market to them when they have been manipulating stock markets for decades.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:15:35
You should know that they have their own funds right? Why would they only focus on investing investors money?
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:57:23
Money can change everything. It's naive to think that crypto is untouchable by them. Just few billions will be able to disrupt the trend of crypto in short term. They will play long and short and manipulate the market big time.
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:46:40
Moral of the story, never trust anyone. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:23:14
We have seen how roger ver and wujihan attacked btc few weeks ago and they are not even the richest players. Imagine wall street funds attacked btc. It's not that diffcult to bring it back to 10 usd.
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:15:25
I won't even bothered wasting my time and effort in helping others to get rich. I will be talking abt ps4 games instead.

Bitcoin will survive any crash. Every crash is an opportunity for new money waiting to flood in.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:03:02
You must be a joke to think that they "can't" get into it based on some "regulations".
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:01:39
If you know the financial system well, you should know there's tons of loopholes that financial insitutions used to get into the things they want. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:31:10
Ignore the idiots over here. Taking profit is never a sin. Well done on your first profit. May you make more of it in the future. Good luck!

Congrats to you for owning 1 btc at the age of 19. Many idiots at your age can't even afford a 0.1 btc.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:20:40
Unpredictable animal? Anyone with huge funds can literally bring it down to it's knees easily. The wall street boys def have it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:51:33
They are not interested in understanding crypto. They are only interested in making crypto their next playground.

A bunch of noobs went ahead and failed in the end. Farktards. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:16:14
Stop acting like a prick. No one knows btc will be at 6.8k today.
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:43:14
No offence but your gf sounds like a typical dumb lady. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:14:12
Worse of all. Your friend chose to believe this scammer instead of you. If i were you, i will unfriend this friend forever. This type are nothing but trouble.
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:07:21
I would worry if the older generation believes in btc. That's means it's getting mainstream which also means that the end is near.

Why don't you buy those bitcoins on your own?

There's a reason why those old fags should just die off, they are a barrier to the future generations.

Yup it's real. I got few of these at just $1.50 usd each at aliexpress few weeks ago. Inclusive of free shipping too. Lol

Stupid people thinks that the party is over. Smart people uses this chance to accumulate at low price and dump it to the stupid people when they came back to the market during bullish days.

Damn. Edgeneo is the authorized dealer of ledger nano. Someone needs to give an explanation.
