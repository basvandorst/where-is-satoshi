Just to make it clear, i don't need any your info with circle accounts. These must be not used  invites or accounts.

When i try to withdraw the systemsays "Sorry for delay...." and when i try to send it anywhere it says "Price have changed" everytime.

Will buy one more. PM
@_date: 2014-09-23 14:19:45
I will start, 50 bucks i think,so it's 40(-10$ Circle's giveaway).

There are lots of people who are waiting for their invites for ages and they are even ready to pay some $ to get it faster. I was the one who waited it from the beginning,but didn't receive any,so i'm just helping people to get their own invite(not for free,but the price is not much higher i'm buying it there). Btw,i'm ready to do it with escrow or if there is someone with not needed invite and good reputation here just to confirm i'm legit

Congrats!

Is there a way to? I thought there is a name on the account which you've applied with?
If they'll refuse,i'm next on the queee :)
@_date: 2014-09-27 18:02:01
I was waiting long time,but recently bought an invite for some $,they are great!
Btw,will buy one more for my friend
@_date: 2014-09-23 14:24:52
It will be open for all sooner or later,i hope.
@_date: 2014-09-28 16:02:03
Can you explain me in simple words what is "to card"?
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:03:33
Got it! Thanks for the info. Any news about their "very soon" out of beta?
I still hope there is a way to boost my "luck":)
@_date: 2014-09-23 15:00:43
I'll buy too! PM if you have any unused/not needed invite.
@_date: 2014-09-22 16:19:23
I wish they made an option to tell users that they are  like # 1000000 in the queee with a week/month position updates to mail. It would be very useful.

Beware! Scammers! They are holding my bitcoins since the "open for all" start.I cannot sell or send it. So i just sit and see how the price is falling down and how my money are being held there for no reason. I didn't buy anything,i just sent money from my wallet to their.Support is saying they are fixing it.
@_date: 2014-09-28 14:32:57
You are right.
Imho,as for now,coinbase is loosing it's battle against circle. Lots of people were unable to sell their btc at Coinbase when the price was falling.Circle is new and has good reputation now,but things can change.

But i did reapply few months later with 2 other emails. So i think it is just random
