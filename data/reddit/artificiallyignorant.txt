Well to all that helped I appreciate it. I tried to verify the account  with WEX since they offered 60% of the coin back and possibly tokens. In the end I got nothing and lost over 8500 LTC. WEX is a scam, be warned.

Bitstamp 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:58:47
Can confirm, bought .0001 coin 3 days ago and still broke.  What gives, am I bitcoining wrong?

Because transaction verification with bitcoin is extremely slow, that’s one of its downfalls. You will get a delayed purchase/ sell value. Very hard to day trade like that.

Only ones that matter unless someone cal really convince me otherwise; bitcoin, litecoin ethereum, dash &amp; Monero

0, exactly 0, we have far more than that to go before this will effect the average fiat owner my friend.

Well I can’t remember if it was 1 coin worth $13-$15 or 13-15 coins because he was trying to convince me to get involved, he had an extreme amount back then, before he bought his house and cars with coin and drug money, got busted and went to weekend jail...

Well, I personally will sink my BTC into LTC before that happens and then back to whatever coin is performing best after the fork. Don’t get forced into the fork if you’re unsure, move to an offline wallet or another currency.

Listen to the BAD Crypto  Podcast on IHeartRadio, start from episode 1 and keep going, it will explain everything. It’s very exciting and there is a lot to learn. It can only go up from here if people believe. And at this point consider only ~1% of the world population believes. We are still merely at inception, Bitcoin is the future, Buy, HODL, Buy, REPEAT.

Thank you very much, now I have to remember the password I would have encrypted my wallet with while I was fucked up

I was a small time pot dealer while in college and got busted. The only reason I got into coin then was that’s all the guy I bought from accepted. I was like a confused little kid at the time and just started creating account all willy nilly and now I’m going through trying to recover those accounts.

Large share holder are guaranteed to crash the market, at this point it’s too widespread with a few people holding 40% of the currency. This is just so they can buy more back at a cheaper price and raise the price. Simple economics, bitcoin doesn’t eliminate the 1%. It only serves them now. We can only hope that Satoshi comes back with their coin and distributes it evenly to wallets in a day of reckoning.

I love Bitstamp, never had any issues with them and they have a majority of the altcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:58:51
Arbitrage (check the price on both markets) plus I’ve been using Bitstamp since inception and believe in the company.  
  
Great article on it.

Bitstamp 100% my favorite place.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:50:36
I buy on Bitstamp and sell on Coinbase while residing in NY using a bank account in NY. Totally legal.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:36:54
For starters it’s investing and you’re breaching any legal contract and TOS you have with coinbase, don’t be foolish and risk something like that. But what do I care, it’s your money. Buy Buy Buy!

Control of bitcoin has already been lost. It’s too unstable to be used as a currency and to volatile to be used as a store of value. The rich have already gobbled up as much coin as they can and that has driven the price up. Futures launch, they flood the market, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and then Warren Buffet exclaims “I told you so.” Buy as much as you can now, HODL, sell Saturday night, walk away with a small profit. Get in while the gettins good and get out before it spoils.

You heard the man now bend over

Are the funds immediately verifiable? Someone should stick Stacky this since 1/3 of bitcoins are considered “lost”

Well it was for him and his GF at the time. So it was a pretty expensive meal, good thing they are married now it better be worth it.

I know hookers that take BTC so a cab driver is definitely not selling, and if they do GREAT! Cheaper coin for the rest of us.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:26:39
You done did it wrong then 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:09:57
Transfer coin to BitStamp and they should pay out to Canadian Dollars, based on market price or sell coin to someone using PayPal. I know people who pay fair market value for coin using PayPal to avoid fees and circumvent the markets.

The irony of bitcoin is you now absolutely NEED money to obtain bitcoin and you CANT pay your bills with it...  The correct advice here would be diversity in assets and of making sound financial decision for your current and future situation. I’ll HODL my single bitcoin and pray my XRP becomes useful some day.
