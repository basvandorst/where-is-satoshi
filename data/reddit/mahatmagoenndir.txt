"over the top and paranoid"? this is the minimum(!) you should do if you hold more than 100$ worth.

While this is highly unlikely it would slow down the findings of new blocks until the difficulty adjusts and hence less/no transactions would be processed. But because the difficulty would adjust heavily it would soon be profitable again for anyone to mine and people who normally wouldnt consider mining would jump onto it to profit and thus blocks would be found every 10 minutes again. So miners kinda have a leverage IF they would work together here but its not that critical in the long term

honestly you will earn more btc of you just buy em. Just think about this: if mining with their gear would be a good idea, why would they rent it to you in the first place? They would make way more money just mining for themselves

I love how they keep developing stuff for their existing and even old hardware and don't just throw a new one with these updates on the market. Well done Ledger!

i don't think they are not legit nor do i think they dont give you exactly what you pay for. When i started dealing with crypto i thought about getting a contract myself and i quickly forgot about it after doing research on cloud mining. The argument that ultimately striked me was: Why would they rent their equipment to you, for say 100€, so you can make 150€ with it when they can simply make that 150€ by mining themselfes. the answer is pretty easy. They have to make more money renting it to people than the mining will bring in. Most people that posted about their contracts on reddit seemed to confirm this theory. The people promoting these services i see are people who gain hashpower by posting their affiliate links (youtubers etc.)  [edit: wrong word usage]
