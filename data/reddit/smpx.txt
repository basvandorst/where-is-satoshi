But … reddit says everything apple does is automatically evil and this feeds right into that confirmation bias!

The message is: has gone full retard. It's not even about waste, it's just bad math. You could make a profit selling the iPhones even after buyin a nexus 5.

It actually says in the article that blackberry and android are also compromised.
But fuck reading, the title says Apple so let's all join the fucking circle!

Victim blaming is pointless. Not everyone is armed with the same experience you are, even if he was careless we can still brainstorm ways to prevent scammers.
