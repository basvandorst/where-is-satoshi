Not even accounting for appreciation of btc over that 1 year period. You’re making money either way

Except for block chain. The most secure and fastest payment system ever created. But no, no value there.

Can you send peer to peer transactions for thousands of dollars anonymously in less than a few days with anything that isn’t bitcoin? 
Literally I’m not kidding, off yourself.

Almost certainly true. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:02:33
You don’t need to have an extra cash account.
You have a budget made up of income, planned expenditures, savings, and investments.
For most people investments are going to be the last thing on that list. So they will often find themselves in positions without that money to invest. That doesn’t mean that they always don’t have money to invest. 
Either you’re being intentionally dense, or you can’t conceive of how someone could not have money to invest but still have investments. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:52:32
I want to hate you but you’re actually right about a lot of these “investors.” I own bitcoin but I don’t consider it an investment any more than owning a $20 bill is an investment. 
Trade bitcoin if you’re a trader, or buy bitcoin if you like/believe in bitcoin. 
Too many people fooled themselves into thinking they were investing experts when the candles kept rising. They had no clue what to expect in terms of downside risk OR upside potential. It’s really telling given the fact that bitcoin is still higher than it was even 2 months ago and people are still in a frenzy. 
Disclaimer: this is easy for me to say because bitcoin has increased in value substantially over the time that I’ve been buying. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:01:35
It went from 1100 -&gt; 200 and stayed there for 2 fucking years. If you weren’t ready for volatility OR the possibility of loss, you didn’t research enough. 
The meme is still funny and true. Get some perspective. Zoom out, and hold on. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:57:44
Haha true

Most likely they will learn when one of the bigger alts fail because of this. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:40:14
Do you not see how this is a fallacy and poor investment advice? 
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:55:00
If you use this strategy there are two possible outcomes:
1. You lose on your investment outright 
2. You make less than you could have
Running that strategy on every investment means that your wins won’t ever recuperate your losses. 
You’re basically putting a ceiling on your winnings while still leaving your losses with no stop (unless you tank to absolute 0). 
You’re not mitigating risk, you’re just crushing return. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:32:42
Same type of person who didn’t know about bitcoin 5 years ago. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:31:55
It has value. It does not have intrinsic value. 
Intrinsic value means that it has natural value. There is nothing in nature suggesting that copper is more value than anything else. It only has value insofar as to how we utilize it.
Intrinsic value means that it is eternally truthful that certain properties are coveted. That’s just never the case. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:12:28
To state the obvious: 1. even if it is going up long term, it’s not going straight up. 2. Don’t be retarded, people know they can lose money. They obviously get caught up in the hype.
It’s not the community’s fault that this guy didn’t stop to think for 1.4 seconds. And fuck you for insinuating that it is. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:52:43
This is so obviously a stupid question. 
If you have n amount of money. And you plan to save and spend x amount of money. You can invest n-x into whatever investment vehicles you choose.
If n-x=0 then you have no money to invest. That doesn’t mean you have $0, that just means you have $0 extra for investing.

Can we just sticky this post to every thread that even asks what “value” bitcoin has? 
I’m just so bored of people who had never heard of crypto 4 months ago suddenly telling me bitcoin is dead. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:10:10
Of course you can. But I don’t think that analogy quite fits. People who put their money in index funds expected consistent positive returns over the long term, which as we know they’ve well achieved. Whether or not they are acceptable risk-adjusted returns for you as an investor is entirely up to your judgement. 
Btc fomo investors thought they were going to get rich over night (or were rather afraid of not getting rich). And had no realistic grounding of what to expect, especially on the downside. Note that this is not to include everyone who bought btc over the price that it is today. I am only including those who splurged with either no exit strategy, no expectation of loss/risk, or no real belief in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:18:57
I came in around May due to the hype. I stayed for the revolution.

@_date: 2018-01-31 16:54:15
That’s an opinion. You’re presenting it as fact, which is annoying. I’m not saying you’re wrong, but I am wondering why you’re on this sub. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:26:29

@_date: 2017-12-01 05:16:14
It does, but that won't happen until we at least see a 9 EMA cross of the 30 EMA.  That hasn't happened yet.  We might still be many days away.  We don't know what the 100 day MA will look like at that point.

“Intrinsic value.”
I’d rather off myself honestly. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:40:02
People are freaking out when the indicators and divergence have never been higher? The bollinger bands and pivot points tell the story. Also the fact that we’re about 2.5x against the 100 day EMA. Were in uncharted territory. Of course a slowdown or lull would be perfectly normal or expected. 
Give it a week and everything will be different. Just like it always is with btc.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:43:49
Took a while for me. Like a long time (approximately 12 hours). I sent the funds at 10:30am and received them around 11pm. This was 2 weeks ago.
I assume they use a super low fee so it’s much slower. I remember checking tx ID and not even seeing a single confirmation for many hours. I’m used to seeing at least one confirmation within minutes. But it’s still very worth it since it’s free. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:33:47

@_date: 2017-12-19 14:34:57
I didn’t know it either. But I bought some a couple weeks back after hearing that gdax covers the transfer fees. Lo and behold it worked. Then I felt bad about my other purchases that I transferred directly from Coinbase.

Bitcoin is also real and limited. And has a “valuable” technology backing it.

You assigning no value to something doesn’t make it a ponzi scheme. That simply makes you wrong.

I will keep my bitcoin until I can use it for shit that I like. Idk why is that so hard to comprehend.

@_date: 2017-12-27 22:38:38
So what is gold to you? 
Are you just saying that because you don’t value the technology behind bitcoin that it has no value? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:34:48
Speculative in what way? You can’t just decide that is a fact. There is a risk of loss, but calling it speculative is still an opinion. For some people, 30% swings aren’t a big deal. For others, a different asset or stock that routinely swings even 4% could be considered speculative. 
Bitcoin and block chain are fairly well-established at this point. Clearly some people have identified this value.
None of what I just described constitutes a Ponzi scheme, regardless of how you value (or don’t value) bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:33:06
He didn’t go to prison for anything related to that.

Oh idc what those people say. Default sub threads are generally atrocious. It’s just twitter replies with an extra sprinkle of r/iamverysmart mixed in. 
But it is entertaining to see how many people insist that they’re right. I like crypto as much as the next guy and I think it’s a great idea with immense value. But I’m not delusional enough to proclaim that to be an absolute truth. These other commenters have an insane level of arrogance to think they’ve been proven correct by one article. You can’t debate with people like that, you can barely interact with them. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 20:05:38
I don’t see how diversity improves the conversation about bitcoin or community that embraces it. Gender/race are not deterministic, or predictive characteristics. My point to which is that I wouldn’t expect whites/blacks/men/women/Asians/gays to have different ideas about bitcoin just because of those characteristics. 
Bitcoin benefits from people who are passionate about bitcoin with really good ideas about how it can evolve, be utilized, better serve its adopters, etc. It literally does not matter what the demographic breakdown of its user base and developer base is. That is merely academic, if not inconsequential.
Stop peddling this bullshit about diversity. It’s not inherently bad or good, it’s not anything. Lending credence to the idea that race or gender is somehow important in a conversation is definitionally racist or sexist. Bitcoin is indiscriminate, and anonymous. It is definitionally agnostic. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 16:06:04

Bitcoin isn't for people that identify with the nation-state. There are people in America who like Americans, and there are people in America who like the United States.
There's a difference between the two. The first group would be receptive to Bitcoin, the other will be much less attracted to it. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:24:06

God this is fucking annoying. 
2 things for everyone to remember:
1. If you’re predicting bitcoin to go up, you’re making it up.
2. If you’re predicting bitcoin to go down, you’re making it up.
There’s no reason for any of us to believe what anyone else says. Do your own research and fuck these other people and their opinions/predictions, they’re no more valuable than your own. 
If you need reassurance and verification of your opinion, you can find a million on either side. It’s a waste of your time.

Sure, I can see a long term bear market, but I also wouldn’t be shocked to see it turn on a dime.

@_date: 2017-11-30 21:13:42
As if we’ve never been belittled for our perspective before lol.
Our arguments are probably stronger and more sound than your own. It’s very easy to argue for the status quo. 
Just because you want to maintain control over other people, doesn’t mean that I have to want that. 
And no matter how you slice it, restate it or repackage it, government is exactly that. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:19:22

@_date: 2017-11-06 15:27:00
I think people overestimate how much "good" governments do.  I don't get to choose what my government forces me to pay for.  That includes killing citizens of foreign nations on my behalf. It also includes killing citizens of my own nation in the name of my "freedom" with money that I earned. Please stop acting as though governments are benevolent. If I found the government to be a worthwhile and beneficial institution, I would voluntarily choose to pay it rather than having money I earned stolen from me.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:36:51

Yeah everything that he said. To me it’s the final evolution of governance. Apolitics. When it’ll happen? Idk. But bitcoin is representative of progress in that direction. At least for me.

That analogy works.  I would agree with that analysis of the situation as well.

Haha ok, again thank you. I appreciate that you have no respect for opinions that disagree with your own.
Thank you for your time. I’m glad you were able to educate me and wake me up from my life long fable. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:15:40
I can only speak for myself, but I'd imagine other people with similar viewpoints value these things: voluntarism, self-interest, freedom, happiness.
Your angle is "governments have always existed so everything we have is a result of the government" when in fact it's generally "individuals create things and the government takes credit."  
The other logical fallacy is that since government's have always existed, they will always exist.  The same could've been said about American slavery in 1830.  It's a radical change (almost unfathomable), especially to people have been raised and educated in a statist society. 
I reject the idea of imposing my will upon other people unless they impose theirs upon me.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:14:23
If you need or want things. Seems pretty obvious. Is this a trick question? 
I’m assuming you hate bitcoin. I’m guessing it’s because you feel you’ve missed out or you just enjoy being the contrarian. I hope being smarter than everyone works out for you. 
EDIT: PS Hodl is a meme we tell newbies who get antsy about price fluctuations. It’s a strategy to avoid overreacting to short term movement. It’s obviously not a long term strategy for the survival of the currency. Don’t be intentionally dense.
Also please forward this comment to any one who thinks the same as you.

I could explain what those indicators mean and how they could show a developing trend or pattern, but that would take me way too long and probably not be as helpful as referring you to a site that covers these things and more.  
As you might imagine, there are way more indicators than just these two (not all indicators are created equal and, in fact, different indicators can all paint a different picture of a particular currency pair), but these are easy for me to understand and relatively widely referenced.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:08:10
Correct. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:14:13
I meant long term as in “making a trade and not closing for a long term” not as in “price action isn’t useful in the long term.” That is to say that the same strategy can be useful over a longer time period to execute multiple trades. 
The longest I’ve ever heard of successful currency trades being open would be a few months. It’s more common to open and close trades over the course of a few weeks or days 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:33:01
Yeah, I'm finding that out based on the reactions to my responses so far. 
It's a bit sad, bitcoin's growth is evidence that the free market allows people to prosper, but people are still latched onto the idea that daddy is looking out for them.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:21:47
Sure, voluntarily put your money forward that's a great idea, if you want.
Don't hold a gun at me and say "pay this money forward or I'll put you in a cage."  
The bitcoin community is by-and-large pretty anti-government (I mean that's the whole fucking point of the currency). How can you find yourself on this subreddit and simultaneously not understand that attitude?
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:00:48
Start with “the good thing about taxes.” Basically everything after that. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:35:34
Yeah, but once CB is back up, it'll stabilize.  In fact it basically already has if you look at the 3m chart.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:30:04
True, but either way it’s not scary growth, it’s consistent with the rising adoption and familiarity of bitcoin. It’s not bubble-ish in that respect. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:06:39
Let me stop you right at "greater good." I'm not deluding myself into pretending to know what the "greater good" is.  I can never know what other people's true desires or motivations are.  Therefore, I refuse to impose my will onto their way of being. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:27:02
Yes the idea of government is a fact. It is innate to humanity. You are absolutely right. You have unlocked the universal truth.
Ffffffuuuuuuck dude, you have my blood pressure through the roof, I’m not gonna lie.
You are excellent at being a nuisance. Blocked 
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:18:37
Yeah there’s so many indicators, and if I’m honest I only understand a handful of them.
The great thing is that you don’t need to know every indicator to develop a winning strategy for forex trading. That said it is incredibly difficult and requires years of practice to find a great formula to win long term.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:08:38
So you’re literally saying government will always exist and you think that makes you right?
If I asked you in 1800 would you have said “slavery will ALWAYS exist, so deal with it”? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:44:40
Newsflash: Many of those same anti-government people here don't want to be a citizen of a nation, really.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:13:55
Based on similar past patterns, I️ believe the bottom will be in the 4800-5400 range. That would be my best guess, but of course others will disagree depending on their analysis.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:22:40
But I’m the one that lacks the ability to think critically. Lol
As if I haven’t heard every statist argument and insult in the book. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:20:45
Not sure about that. If it’s hard to sell, people won’t sell. The price won’t tank. 
People will just exchange on the blockchain since that will be more efficient. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:55:48
Honestly, I would, but I must've struck a nerve with some people.  My inbox is blowing up.  I'm trying to keep up with these other responses.

You can make 0 grand.

@_date: 2017-11-29 15:00:00
It depends what you mean by a while.  I can see a few days, but I think we're gonna see about $14k in about 4 weeks.  Based on my projections, we won't ever seen a $10k bitcoin again.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:35:59
I hear you. But those of us who have been around awhile have felt both sides of the swings. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:34:53
I think you're a shade high.  I like $14k in the next month.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:22:37
I️ don’t even know why you engaged me with your non-argument. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:41:17
Yeah swing and miss there haha 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:01:13
Yeah, using a little price action analysis 
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:27:12
You've ceased to make an argument. Thank you for making me look good.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:08:03
Correct. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:28:41
Arms and security organizations I can pay to protect me. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:36:24
Or you can just spend bitcoins as...bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:38:55
I️ really see both as possibilities. The price action leans toward 5k. The news leans toward huge surge. 
I️ could see a full trend reversal because of this. The next 3 days should tell the story, but if it reverses upward, it will be quick. 
If it continues to fall it should happen gradually.

@_date: 2017-11-07 03:31:04
People choose to engage in transactions that are beneficial to them.
That about solves it.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:16:37
I haven't once insulted you.  And I'm not making myself a victim here, but think about the fact that you're arguing for the status quo.  It's very simple to argue from your side since statism is just "common sense." 
Now onward, what do you mean what does life look like without citizenship?  It looks like a set of individuals who engage in mutually beneficial transactions (when necessary or desired), in order to bring happiness to their lives.  That feels like a trick question. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:08:28
How do you get access to your 2x coins to sell them once they go live?
That's the part that really confuses me about every fork.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:56:56
First time I've ever wanted to sodl my bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:52:01
That’s true. You should only debate or engage those who are worthy. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:28:59
That’s what going mainstream means.
Most people getting in now have never thought about a world without government. They’ve never even posed the question of “hey why is this the system we live in?” to themselves. 
Some are statists because they think government benefits them. I would guess that many more are statists because they’ve never fathomed another way. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:59:29
This is pretty standard growth for things gaining mass adoption. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:24:09
You're claim is "reality won't change." Which is incredibly vague.  Perspectives and interpretations of reality evolve all the time (the same claim can't be made for "objective" reality because none of us know what that is).  Which again refutes you're previous claim of "some form of government always existing."  Your argument isn't even sound for a statist.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:56:32
Yeah, I can see all of that taking hold.  Glad we're seeing the same trend.  
The cooling effect will be quick when it happens, usually BTC struggles last for a couple of weeks at the most.  7000 by weeks end seems more than reasonable.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:46:06
I️ disagree with you wholeheartedly, but you’re free to do whatever you damn well please. I️ hope you’re wrong, but your opinion is as valid as any other. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:21:50
Wrong. Wrong. So so wrong. I actually don’t feel like explaining it. Others have done enough in this thread. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:10:46
Yeah but none of them have ever even fathomed another method. That’s the source of my aggravation. I don’t care what their opinions are, but have they ever even questioned anything? How can you be so fucking sure of yourself? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:08:31
Bingo 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:42:04
Fair enough. I would argue that there’s nothing “wrong” with any form of individualism or governance. I just value my freedom moreso than others. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:22:26
That would require them to shutdown basically every copy of the blockchain. Which more or less requires them to dismantle the internet. 
Not a legitimate fear. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:26:53
Not necessarily. But sure coalitions can stick together. It would be an effective militia. Not a militia backed by rulers. They would be a militia to serve the sole purpose of protecting their individual property. Not for the purpose of imposing their way of life onto others either externally or internally. 
As long as it’s voluntary, I see no conflict with a protective militia in an anarchical environment. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:03:13
That's a fair argument.  It's the argument that minarchists frequently make, which I dislike significantly less than the argument that full-blown statists make.  In short, my huge problem with government is that it violates the non-aggression principle.  Even democracy allows the majority to impose it's will upon the minority.  Some people are willing to make that trade to preserve their safety, sense of order, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:45:08
Well I’ve been doing it all wrong 
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:20:25
To summarize: are you saying that because it is that way, it must remain that way?
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:13:51
Truthfully I’m not getting anything out of you telling me how wrong I am about things that you can’t possibly know for sure. And I also think fuck you for being an insulting douchebag. You’re the exact kind of person I absolutely do not want making decisions for me. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 23:30:32
Water is a commodity. Commodities exist in markets. Markets are subject to speculation. Not all markets are subject to the same degree of speculation. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:42:19
Basically, you've outlined my one and only fear with bitcoin.  I love bitcoin. But like you said it's hard to delineate how many people are purchasing BTC to own BTC and how many are just thinking about their BTC in terms of USD.   
I think the long term prospects of BTC are bright, regardless.  But I also expect there to be some sort of adversity over that timeline.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:47:36
Ok. You’re such a grown up. Please tell me how to live. Teach me how to be better. 
Fuck off.
Adults that I know want control of their own lives. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:07:03
Yes because those are the only two possibilities. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:00:43
Also, just so everyone knows: this guy is talking out of his ass. He might be right, but it’s way more likely that he’ll be very wrong. Do your own analyses. Don’t take the words of some internet know-it-all who decides that he’s unlocked the key to the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:20:30
How does this get downvotes on a sub dedicated to a currency without government?
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:49:18

That wouldn’t be anarchy. That would be a ruler or dictator. That’s the opposite of anarchy.
Also democracy is inherently forceful. The will of the majority is imposed upon the minority. Thus I am opposed to it.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:30:42
More people will agree with me here :) 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:20:04
100000? I’m thinking 125000 minimum. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:18:28
I’ve responded numerous times with logic and reason in this thread. I haven’t dismissed anyone’s opinion or been rude except to this guy. 
I’m sure you didn’t take the time to read any of it, or if you did, I’m sure you didn’t bother considering my position and had me written off from the get go. That’s fine, my argument is stronger because I actually face resistance when I deliver it. 
Probably a generalization, but your argument is likely lazy and sounds something like “but muh violence and muh roads.” 
Anyways, if you want to learn about what anarchy means, you can do that on your own time. I’m not going to sit here and explain my position to someone who has compared me with an 11 year old simply because I berated a guy who was being a dick. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:33:00
Yeah it’s nuts. The statists are everywhere. But most of them don’t even know they’re statists. They still think democracy works.

Those aren’t the only 2 options. 
Private arbitration and independent security firms already exist.
And best of all, you aren’t forced to pay for either of them.
I’m unwilling to surrender the monopoly on force to a thing that I don’t control.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:50:30
No one thinks that. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:09:52
But for my own clarification: let’s say you own 1 BTC. Do you suddenly have 1 BTC &amp; 1 S2X?
Meaning you could spend each independent of the other? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:40:04
We won’t find common ground here. Which is pretty much why I prefer anarchy. I don’t want people forced to compromise on their principles under the oppression of democracy or authoritarianism in general. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:34:57
Yes that’s what I’m saying. Re-read my post. 
The new investors, and even some old ones don’t have the same vision. It’s just a get rich quick scheme. 
When in reality we could have both. We can be wealthy and also free. I’m just not sure how many people care about the second one. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:29:35
I'm 100% against every single dollar spent by my government.  If I came to your house and took 25-30% of your paycheck, but I told you "it was for your own good," would you believe me?
But I do grant that I am implicitly agreeing with the laws of the land that I occupy.  That is a fair contradiction to point out. It doesn't mean that I can't argue for a stateless society on the land that I currently occupy, however.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:25:25
The guy you're responding to is consistently the worst troll on this sub.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:22:33

Then buy now lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:32:20
It's coinbase being down.  I bet it caused a minor panic.  I'm trying to get on to buy more.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:18:51
Why would we need embassies if we don't have nations? Who would be able to enforce the "laws of the land" if there are no laws? 
Why would a business not be able to offer the same services and products as the state? 
We can ask broad questions all we want, it doesn't add to either of our arguments.  More importantly, it doesn't make the way of life you support (i.e. statism) to be "correct".  I have no urge to be right.  My belief in anarchy is 100% self-interested.  If other people find it beneficial, great.  If not, that's great too.  I just want to be left to make my own decisions.  
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:28:53
Ok. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:27:53
Ah so you are.  You could've just said yes.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:26:49
It's refreshing to know that there are others out there that agree with me.  It can be very isolating when the statists attack you in droves.  It's very easy to start to feel like the insane person.
That's mainly why I try to respond to some of these people.  Just so others that share my principles (or are neutral) can see that other perspectives do exist.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:33:23
Omg DAE SOMALIAAAAA!!!!1!!1 
Dude spare me, I’m begging you. I already struck a nerve with so many statists. I’ve literally summoned them to come after me.  They can’t help themselves, but they love trying to help “fix” me. As is the statist way. 
“We are good, we will make you good too. Come see what we made you” 
Ugh it makes me throw up.

Pretty much my take as well.

@_date: 2017-11-30 21:10:46
Almost positive based on the triple question mark that he’s was being sarcastic. That and the fact that the answer to this question is painfully obvious. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:37:01
Peculiar, isn't it? But also, hilarious that BCH hasn't taken advantage of this dip and been able to increase. They've failed again.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:54:59
Agreed, of course my prediction is subject to change depending on how the price moves over the course of the next few days.  It's all very dependent.  The fork could also destroy my prediction as you mention.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:16:26
Good for you. I’m sick of being insulted by asshats that have to be right. I get nothing out of debating people who are already concrete in their beliefs. One of the many reasons I like anarchy. I don’t need to engage in discourse with you haha 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:54:28
Agree on all points.  Though I would go so far as to speculate that buy and hold with BTC seems like a safe bet for at least the next 3-5 years based on past performance.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:34:28
I don’t necessarily agree. One person would need to amass enough power on their own to influence the masses.
That’s a very difficult task especially when opposition can form coalitions to oppose that.
Could it happen? Of course.
I’d rather it be that difficult to amass power rather than simply having power forfeited to you by some election. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:40:27
Collective solutions compel people to comply thus eliminating their agency.  You sound like you're in favor of that.  That's fine.  I'm not.  And guess what? I'm also not wrong for thinking that.

You’re making an absolute claim which you cannot possibly know. Since your argument relies on this assumption/claim, I reject it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:19:28
You say it’s never viable. But that is a claim which you can’t back up. It may never be an optimal solution in your opinion. But anarchy is a society free from rulers, I really don’t see how that is controversial or even unpopular. It’s incredibly liberating to imagine life without someone looking over your shoulder. 
99% of your interactions everyday are probably anarchical. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:01:01
Wait there's no tx fees to send BTC from gdax to your own wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:54:01
Correct, but at a certain point saving is no longer viable. Saving is curtailed by need and desire. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:08:32
You don’t need to pay an individual body guard, but one possibility may be that you can choose to contribute to a policing provider for your property or choose not to. There may even be multiple companies serving the same areas, so there’s is competition and choice. For the protection of your physical person, you are free to carry and own weapons. 
As far as contract enforcement, violation of contracts is almost definitely not an effective method for conducting a successful long term business. When there are legitimate disputes, the people are left to work it out without the involvement of the state. 
Will people get screwed? Sure. 
How much different is that than suing a massive corporation only to be buried in lawyers fees when you have a legitimate gripe? 
There will be downsides, but for me, the upsides far outweigh the down. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:55:49
Man, I can't imagine being so off-base and then trying to throw my stupidity in other people's faces.

I don’t think we disagree. I’m saying that simply judging a price bottom or top as “healthy” without any regard for metrics or analysis beyond the price is meaningless.

Are you mad that you're missing out? Just buy some, my non-native English speaking friend.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:07:25
I 100% agree. And as I alluded to in a different post: this is my prediction today.  It could very easily change tomorrow.  Price action strategies tend to lag behind, but they adjust themselves as we gain more information. 
Either way, I would not be looking for an entry opportunity soon for traders.  Obviously for hodlers, it's always a good time to buy.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:20:49
Yeah I hear you man.  You basically summed up my feelings and beliefs.

Citizenship is a fucking construct of nations you dolt. Try thinking for five minutes about why citizenship isn’t necessary for society to exist. 
I’m done with you. You’re a cocky prick, and I absolutely do not want to engage in discourse with you or anyone you choose as a leader. 
Politics is two types people: people who want to be left alone and people who won’t leave them the fuck alone.
Thanks have a good one 
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:54:59
Way more likely, sure. But we’re still talking about roughly 0%. 
Obviously past performance isn’t the only thing that matters. Current market conditions are a factor as well. If those stay roughly the same, bitcoin is a safe bet. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:31:27
Less democratic. More voluntarist for me 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:54:03
Government is not a natural result of society.  Government is a result of people desiring power and control seizing it and maintaining it for themselves.  
Society is only valuable in that you can interact with it to make beneficial transactions.  How this applies to infrastructure: there are plenty of businesses that need roads in order to function (trucking companies, shipping/logistics companies, retail stores, etc.) that they would need to either maintain or create their own roads in order to function.  They could hire construction companies to build and maintain those roads.  Charge tolls or fees or whatever for individuals to travel along those roads. It's not that difficult.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:22:24
"Tax is still needed"
Is tax needed if government doesn't exist?  I know that you know the answer to this question, but I'm trying to point out the fact that you're not even trying to think outside the box.
"Statism is the norm and therefore it must be correct because I can't imagine how anything would work otherwise" &lt;- every statist argument ever

None of that is an indication of health or illness. 
Those are patterns. They can be valuable, but they aren’t a fundamental/metric worth paying attention to when you’re trying to determine if bitcoin is “healthy.”
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:52:04
It doesn't have anything to do with the perception of the "number" that the price is.  It's about what the price action tells us about the possible movement in the future based on technical indicators (moving average diversion and relative strength index).  
A similar pattern of the indicators where they stand today, previously has led to a proportional increase which would be equivalent to 7000 now. Followed by a sharp proportional decrease equivalent to a drop to roughly the numbers I mentioned (4800-4900).
Obviously the past doesn't always dictate the future, but that's why we use certain indicators to help identify possible patterns.
@_date: 2019-04-14 22:05:33
TFW people call a bottom “healthy.” 
There is nothing about price that is “healthy or unhealthy” other than “up or down”. Flash crashes and flash run ups are as much a part of a healthy market as slow declines and steady bull markets. 
TLDR healthy doesn’t mean anything in this context, stop

I think relying on the government is more wishful thinking.  Can the government not turn on a dime? Ask the regimes that America backed in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Kuwait, etc.  Ask the Japanese interned during WWII. Ask the Jews exterminated in Germany.  Ask the whatever million "citizens" killed by the Soviets.  
How anyone can argue governments are benevolent forces is beyond me.  But the most aggravating part is being told that being forced to pay them is for my own good (and the collective "greater good").

Children is one that I can't come up with a good solution for while still being consistent.  I've been grappling with that one for a bit.  I think my best answer would be that I would clearly have to subdue the person, especially if I believed the child's life was in danger.  The rest would be settled after the fact by a private arbiter or mediator, I suppose.
But your scenario raises a more pertinent question for me: when is a human an adult? Are only adults afforded the rights and responsibilities of their own existence? It's very grey when you're talking about children because you're often toeing the line of person-hood and property.  I'm sure some other anarchists or libertarians that are smarter than I have developed some solutions that are consistent with the philosophy.

The best part of bitcoin is independence.  And for me that includes independence from your informed/uninformed/completely retarded opinions.

Well thankfully, I have no use for your opinion of me. 
What I do have are a lot of questions, but I’m sure you don’t have many good answers. 
The most burning question pertains to why you spend your time on a bitcoin forum if you have no interest or see no potential in bitcoin. That’s like me going to an nfl sub to trash random teams, even though I don’t watch football. Or venturing over to a commie sub to start arguing with communists. I don’t really understand it. 
I’m guessing you’ll use the guise of “education” as your purpose here. But that’s just a thinly veiled excuse for you to be a cocky, insufferable prick. 
Most of us are more than happy to discuss the investment we’ve made, but not against someone who’s purely acting in bad faith. 1) it’s pointless and 2) we hate you. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:17:21

This shouldn’t be your investment rationale. Either you believe in bitcoin as an investment, as a tool or as an idea.

It’s clear that you didn’t watch the video. It’s actually well put together, articulate, fair, and not just a 28 minute bashing of JP. 
JP basically makes huge mistakes by collapsing all of the ideas that oppose his into one cohesive ideology, which is simply not the case. Once you dismantle that part of his theory, then his boogie man falls apart. 
The video does admit that some of the things JP says are fair and accurate, but it nails him down on the specifics and extensions of his beliefs. Imo it’s imperative to watch for anyone that’s aware of JP. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:28:03
Yes and that’s why holding or buying is a better move than selling or exchanging? Wait for utility to ramp up as devs work on segwit/ lightning/future projects. 
Simply because bitcoin hasn’t replaced the USD today doesn’t mean that it never will or that it’s completely valueless. This is the logical mistake that every single fudder makes. 
The future value of bitcoin is built into the price today. The same as any security/asset/currency. Either you believe that it has potential or you don’t. In which case you’ll either buy later when it’s more expensive or you won’t buy at all. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:09:51
Miners make money off tx fees. They make money either way. They benefit from bitcoin being as popular as possible driving up the cost. And from people transacting and embedding those fees into new blocks for them to mine. You sound like you need to educate yourself about how bitcoin works before you start spewing your ill-informed opinion. 
And I should have clarified that the btc foundation (aka white paper) has all the features and design that you want in a currency.

Wallets are encrypted, there are a variety of ways to guard yourself. Multiple wallets, paper wallets, trezors, etc. Ultimately the storage and protection is as good as you want it to be. Theft of bitcoin is far more likely through an exchange. Exchanges operate almost solely based on their reputations. Consumers are obligated to protect themselves and be vigilant in the exchanges they decide to patronize. 
Your CC company is under no obligation to cover losses from fraud with the burden of proof on you. The same way you wouldn’t just leave your credit card or cash laying around, you shouldn’t leave your bitcoin somewhere unprotected.
Both have vulnerabilities, btc is far more protected imo. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:42:35
I’ll agree. Even if the 21 million btc supply came to equal all the cash USD in circulation (about $1-2 trillion) 0.001 btc is still about $100.

I would pump the brakes a bit on that. I’m not saying it’s impossible, but trying to predict that far out is basically like back to the future predicting the cubs to win the World Series in 2016. 
It’s unabated speculation. Sure there might be technical analysis that can point to that or even market indicators that show that btc is becoming more widely adopted, but projecting that far down the road and a magnitude of growth that massive is just too optimistic for me. There are so many factors at play and hurdles to overcome first. All of the players aren’t even on the field yet. 
You could totally be right, I hope you are. I’m not even saying it’s unreasonable. But we’re so far removed from that now that it seems like speculating about spaceships in 1903. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:27:04
I’m not dumb enough to make that prediction. Of course I couldn’t possibly know. The sub-divisibility of btc could mean that small fractions will one day be worth tons, especially as circulating supply decreases (more lost coins, wealthier hodlers stockpiling massive amounts, etc).
I’m simply scaling it to its most frequently mentioned counterpart which is the USD. I chose to use only physical dollars. If you count all wealth that exists in other currencies as well, you’re talking about a much much larger number. 
I don’t know what the upper bound is, I’m just putting it into some semblance of perspective. I hope we hit the moon. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:08:07

@_date: 2018-02-06 19:10:39
I certainly agree with the portion about wallets. Hopefully they continue to stay above ahead of that curve.
I’m willing to forego the protections of law in this instance for the preservation of privacy and the circumvention of an antiquated banking system baked with corruption and manipulation. I’m not ok with people stealing money and I think private agencies or insurance providers will come to exist to protect peoples funds. 
Freedom carries risk. I’m ok with that.

I disagree. Based on btc’s past behavior with these price action indicators (specifically MACD and RSI), I expect there to be a fairly significant dip when we hit (or approach) 7000, likely back to something in the low 5ks or high 4s (think 4800-4900),

I’m not saying we outlaw the USD, I’m just saying let’s offer an alternative and let people choose for themselves. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:47:51
Network effect is huge. Bitcoin is far more decentralized than any new coin would be when it popped up. 
No crypto would be nearly as effective immediately because of the hurdle of value acknowledgement that it would have to overcome. Btc has all the features that you want in a developing currency. It only needs time.

That’s just utterly untrue. Patterns and indicators can be leveraged in ways that create an edge for investors. It’s not easy and I don’t profess to be proficient at it. 
This is just my take on what those specific indicators are telling us about the price action of BTC. 
Long term, the PA isn’t nearly as useful, but in the near term (less than a few months) it can be very useful.

@_date: 2018-02-02 20:15:36
What? If bitcoin is valuable they could exchange it for goods or other currency. How they obtain it is irrelevant to miners. The important thing for miners is to be the most efficient and productive miners to reap the most possible btc. This helps the bitcoin user base as the faster miners work, the faster tx are confirmed and the lower the tx fees are.

If my prediction is correct we’ll see this unfold in a much shorter timespan. Thinking more like 1 month.
For the record, my long term opinion is that BTC will grow tremendously. But my short term prediction is based on BTCs price action behavior and similar indicator patterns/conditions

No one denies any of this. But individuals cannot be held accountable for the actions of others. 
If you kill a dude and steal his wallet, and I don't know anything about that, and then I ask you if I can borrow $20, am I at fault if you give me that $20?

Knowledge is all that matters under that law. If I didn't know, the property would be returned to the owner if it could be identified.
I would not be prosecuted.

Minors aren't adults. We're dealing with a different things.
Also, he was obviously involved in drug transactions, that's illegal, no question. The point is that the penalty for that specific crime should not also account for any other potential crimes that may have occurred leading up it without the knowledge of the individual's involved in the current crime. Those are separate cases altogether.

I can't possibly agree with that. I am not and should not be accountable for the actions of others (especially strangers).
And yes, in that analogy I am getting off scot-free.

Nope that's not my argument. My argument is the drug purchaser and the broker of the deal aren't accountable for violence that took place to acquire the product if they don't have knowledge of it. They are only accountable for the crime they are committing. You implied in your OP that drug deals contribute to violence, which may be true, but not in a direct and liable fashion. 
And no of course I'm not liable for my friend selling drugs out of a house I'm living in.

I guess the premise would be that any sort of panic could create pessimism and scared sellers. Thus price drops.

Yep. Pretty simple to understand. The circumstances and conditions have changed. History literally cannot repeat itself, contrary to what so many people say.

Lol. Fiat and irrational deep trust in strangers that don’t give a fuck about you or your well-being go hand in hand.
