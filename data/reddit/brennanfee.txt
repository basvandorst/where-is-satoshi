Tell me what time it is and then you will know that government works.  Did you drive to work today?  How are those roads doing for ya'.  Be ignorant if you want but governments have and do work (that doesn't mean they are perfect... indeed far from it).  That's why we strive to form a "more perfect" union because that destination can never be reached.

The one thing has nothing to do with the other.  The shutdown has nothing to do with "being able to fund ourselves".  It is a political ploy and a failure to govern.
First understand how the government works... then you can criticize it without sounding like an moron.

Well, you are merely shouting out a bunch of nonsense about issues we aren't discussing so... no, you aren't "doing it right" if "right" in this context is contributing to the conversation.
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:10:34
All of those reasons are horribly ignorant.  I entirely concede that our system right now is hanging by a veritable thread... it is up to the people to right the ship and voting is **one of** the very important tools we need to employ.  It may sound "Pollyannic" but more people voting would actually show results... even more so would be more people voting for the right people and the right issues (like election and campaign finance reform).
Every form of political system (so far) has its issues - some more, some less.  But most often throughout history the failure of any particular government following any particular political system was the result of not the political system but because of a corruption of that system (a failure to follow its tenets) thereby ceasing to be that form of government.

Well, firstly I'm a supporter of bitcoin and the whole new currency movement.  However, the current budget fight (and now shutdown) have NOTHING to do with anything related to bitcoin and owning bitcoin will in no way be helped or hurt by the current situation.
Secondly, the shutdown isn't because the US doesn't have money or "can't even fund itself".  That's just not how our budget process works in the US.  My comments were to indicate that OP just doesn't understand how things work and is making a spurious connection between these current events and bitcoin.
Lastly, I didn't say he was a moron - I said that without the appropriate knowledge he sounds like a moron.  I am sure that if he took a few minutes to actually learn how things work he would grasp the subject.  [And he replied back and I did explain it to him and he does seem to understand.  See, people can learn.]
In my day we actually taught this stuff in school but I'm aware that with cutbacks we don't teach how the US government works to our own citizens any more.  Quite sad actually.

I would say (when it works) it is the highest expression of our humanity.  We are social creatures and government is the organizational expression of that social drive we have with one another.


Your definition of government and mine must be very different.


Except... it and many others are exactly why we do things for and on behalf of each other through our governments.  We learned (evolutionary) a long time ago that we accomplish more together than we can apart.


Ah... but "figuring it out" isn't the challenge.  It's funding it and offering its use to all that is the challenge.  It's understanding that we all benefit by pooling our resources and building it which helps create commerce, create jobs, create the ability to easily go where we wish when we wish without limits.  In short, to have a community... and under the objectively better forms of governments a free community.

You are truly welcome.

Only in some political systems.  In free systems the people are the government.
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:53:05


What do I not understand?  Please, explain to me how what I said is in any way mistaken.
And just so you know... I am a bitcoin (and etherium) owner.  I believe in its potential... but I also believe that OP's statement was mistaken at best.  There is simply no connection between bitcoin and the US governmental budget process.  Now, if you want to start talking about the FED and it's policies there are indeed links there.  Fiat currency is on the decline, we all know that... but fiat currency or no; governments will still have budget processes and our current budget "fight" has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with our "ability to fund" anything.
@_date: 2018-01-20 09:03:34


Yes!  And that should be the focus.  We are paying them to do a job and they are failing to do it or merely posturing, as I said, for political reasons.  This is bullshit and should not be tolerated by the electorate.  But... none of that means that "we can't fund the government".  We aren't bankrupt, we don't lack the money... we just don't have a budget and the way our system of government works we can't spend money unless there is a law (budget) telling us what we can spend where.


Except... you can't.  Bitcoin doesn't help that.


Again, I completely agree (and not with you not being a genius... it is very possible you are genius in some areas).  But the more important part in my comment was not you "sounding like a moron" but was "first understand... then you can criticize".  Perhaps I could have been more precise by saying, "then you can criticize CORRECTLY."
Our current system of representative democracy is fundamentally broken (and no, Trump didn't break it... although he may have been the straw to the camel, it doesn't matter).  It's been slowly breaking for the past 30 years and as usual the vast populace is just asleep.  We, all of us, need to vote and vote better.  We need to insist that we fix our election system including and in particular the outside influence that money has in our process.  It's supposed to be "of the people, by the people, and for the people", not "of those who have money, by those who have money, and for those who have money - everyone else go screw yourselves."
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:53:23


No.  Not even a little bit.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:03:12
Oh... sorry, my apologies.
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:55:34


Oh, yes.  Totally.  But the problem is the process and how we have allowed it to become corrupted.  Even the candidates are hand picked and cultivated by the powerful; all the better to keep them beholden to them.
Regardless, OP's comment that the government shutdown is somehow related to "limited funds" or a "lack of funds" is just wrong.  That was my only point.  It isn't a fiat currency vs. new currency question at all... that's all I'm saying.
Now... there are indeed lots of government policies and FED policies that are about fiat vs new.  Just not the current budget fight.

It's also why we need the CFPB (Consumer Finance Protection Bureau) which Trump's administration has gutted.  Without the CFPB the banks wouldn't have gotten caught and that would have just been more profits added to their already record high profits.

Good thing the President doesn't control that.  The Fed does.  (Honestly, I wish people would actually learn how their government works.)

They don't actually print anything any more you know?  So, no... that is not how it works anymore.

Thank you Mr. Pedant.

I'm not sure how that was "helpful".  It is a famous quote, and I did not attribute it to Gandhi because I was aware that would be a missatribution.  You *might* have a point had I in fact attributed it to Gandhi.  In fact, you will see if you read my post that I did not attribute it at all, just indicated that it is a famous quote — which it is!  The quote, as I presented it, is the famous version regardless that it is a shortened form of a longer phrase, regardless that it is commonly missatributed, and regardless of where it came from.
So... in the end, all you are doing is nitpicking so as to feel superior.  I hope you feel better now that a bunch of internet strangers can see how truly "smart" you **think** you are.
@_date: 2019-12-15 20:52:30


No, not at all.  The quote is particularly apropos to the course of events for cryptocurrency and is a reminder that this fits with history.  It was also intended that we should not be deterred.
Of course, a pedantic asshole like you can't grasp the nuance of context, so I can see how you missed it.
@_date: 2019-12-19 00:52:53
Well, that makes things perfectly clear. /s
@_date: 2019-12-15 21:37:38


No.  We are talking about a technology that was largely ignored by the banks and governments (first part of the quote), than laughed at by those same groups as being a silly toy (second part of the quote) and then some started combating it including some jurisdictions passing laws (third part of the quote), and finally now that some banks are embracing cryptocurrencies we are at the last part of the quote.
It is sad in a way that I have to spell it out for you.  Perhaps if you had an IQ above 60 it would have been clear how it applied directly to the arc of the cryptocurrency market.

Not to be too much of a jerk but unless you are writing code you are in no way part of "us".  Just owning coin is not the same as participating in the tech.

They decide which coins to mine not necessarily which "software".  The algorithms are baked into the designs.
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:13:46
That's a design choice.  Verification has to ocurr some way and for the "expense" those participating get a reward.  It still does not constitute "us" in the sense that those mining have, in any way, say or control over how things work and what it is.
Blockchain is much bigger than most people realize and will be used in all kinds of areas (not just the financial space and coins).  The concept of mining may not (likely will not) be used in other areas.  Sometimes, having an "authority" is exactly what is needed... other times distributing that authority is necessary.  It all depends on the use cases involved.

And it will all fail and be reversed even more quickly.  Globalization has been a net benefit to the world, yes it has issues, but overall it has been a positive thing.  Once people prove this to themselves through failure they will return.

That's an excellent idea and a much better use of that money.  Even if Bitcoin never goes anywhere and crashes right to zero it is still a better use of that money.
