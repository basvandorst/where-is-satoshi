Correct that’s how they usually work, but according to CME they will not purchase the BTC they will just have a cash out in the amount.  If you read this link below it explains it better than I would be able to, so like usually you’d be on the hook to buy BTC, you are only on the hook for the cash required to buy, you wouldn’t actually be buying or getting the rights to buy a BTC. Which is why I wondered how this actually impacts the price.

Your argument is about Comcast being too big, I guess I’m confused as to what is so bad about them?  Would you prefer smaller companies provide you the same service?So when a company makes more money they corner a market? Like AMZN taking over the ecommerce world, should we begin to ban them bc they’re getting too big and potentially too powerful? Or should we embrace their success? What about google, or Apple, or Wal-Mart, or any number of the large companies of their industry? I fail to see how large corporations that employ millions of people worldwide are “bad” because they make money?  And I don’t hate socialism bc it can fail, I don’t like it because it either does fail or slowly shifts to communism which also doesn’t work.  I prefer a world where anyone can do anything they wish, so long as it doesn’t hurt anyone else.

You mean when you give the govt more power and control, the political leaders in charge want even more power and control at the expense of even their own citizens, because once they have the power over the people there’s nothing the people can do at that point?  
I never understood the bad rap that having more control over your own life and choices received...oh ya if you don’t like the govt you’re automatically a racist or a bigot or you hate poor people, pretty much you’re an A**Hole...that’s right now I remember.

My favorite thing about bitcoin, outside of the simplicity of use, would be the limited number of coins in circulation.  The FED has proven that paper money is useless if you can just print your way out of a crisis, instead of working for it and solving the problem.  There is no printing press with BTC, that is my favorite part.

Well actually 401Ks are MUCH safer than previous pension plans you're referring to, as pension plans disappear after a company disappears and A LOT of pension plans are underfunded to begin with, which leaves you with nothing in retirement.  401Ks on the other hand is your money, you don't have to contribute, they give you the option and most companies match a pretty solid percent which is like making extra pay for saving your own money.  And as for the penalty the companies don't penalize you, the Govt does as an incentive to keep folks from pulling their money out, and it's only 10% on top of your income tax, as a way to hopefully help people have extra retirement income when they get older.

And why do you listen to the media? Their paid hacks. They work for the rich and powerful and those trying to oppress the people.  Control the media, control the people. Best to just keep the news turned off or watch it but don't believe it, they're their to scare you and push the narrative the highest bidder is paying them to push.  Both sides btw, FOX, CNN, NBC, all of them have an agenda, and when caught in the act they just don't report it bc they are the news or they blame the opposing network or bc most people only watch one media outlet be it left leaning or right leaning, and don't take both sides into consideration and form their own opinion on the matter, you're force fed into believing the one opinion. Pretty sad, but predictable.

Interest rates are sooo cheap right now it's smarter to get a mortgage as the housing market is out of control.  If he invests 20% down on a home and gets a mortgage and the market collapses where and a situation arises where he needs funds  he would have to sell his house at a loss.  That could be a 1-200K issue, where if he only puts 20% down that is only 60-70K he would lose were he to get foreclosed on. It mitigates his risk.  I would also suggest he not consider a 300-350K house as they only make combined 50-70K, plus have a kid and live paycheck to paycheck already.  I would be looking for a house 1/2 that cost with that income range.

This ^^^
Companies doing nothing but buying back shares to boost the appearance of increased EPS, and you’re starting to see it in the reports that companies are struggling to make WS’s numbers bc they’re running out of fancy tricks to make their numbers, the QE test that forced people to move their money from normally low risk interest bearing assets into the stock market because the interest rates were so low that the low risk interest rates were practically zero, it’s going to hurt ALOT of people.  
And if you don’t think the housing market is a bubble just wait, as they raise interest rates people won’t be able to afford the payment on a 300K house like they used to, so as rates increase less people can afford to pay you these absurd prices and I believe if we don’t have a crash, we’re going to have a long period of flat housing prices.
The entire global economy is walking on eggshells and unfortunately it’s going to hurt a lot of folks.  It will probably increase safe havens such as gold and BTC, but there are going to be a lot of people hurt by these spending policies we’ve had the past 10 years in many of the large countries across the world.

I'm saying that they can provide you a pension plan, but if the company goes out of business you get jack squat and then you'd be wishing you had a 401K.  It's not always greed.  If you think of the cost an average employee costs a company, and if companies had to contribute to pension plans for all these years after retirement and how much longer people are living, they eventually wouldn't be able to continue paying their current employees higher salaries, and eventually would go out of business.  I've work in finance and accounting at 4 different Fortune 500 companies, and worked on these specific benefits at 3 of the 4, and the decisions that have to be made on benefits and perks at a company would blow your mind.  Before you blame it all on corporate greed, which I'm not saying that there aren't companies out there like that, in my experience it's not that greedy when you factor in the amount of money that you cost your company and how much money they contribute to every employee between retirement, insurance, vacation, workers comp, and other various benefits they offer.  I think if you owned your own business and really sat in front of the numbers you'd really realize how fortunate you are to have a corporation give you anything, because I've worked for some that just couldn't afford to give out anything but they are minimum.

Well there is only a vesting period if they match...so confused by that comment. And as for the limit that multiplied by the amount of years you work is quite a good amount of money.  In addition, if the company doesn't match then the eventually lose good employees as a good employee will find a company all others equal with better benefits.  I've gone from an employer matching 3%, to 4%, to my current employer matching 6%.  In the industry I'm in there is a better company but they only provide 6% if you contribute 8%, plus my company has unlimited PTO, so the benefits currently outweigh the negatives.  It's all perspective, but at the end of the day nobody forces you to work somewhere if they don't have the benefits you like go elsewhere, they'll get the message when the can't retain talented people.

As a side note, Later in the convo my cousin said the guy also has these things called “Bitcoin”, at that point I knew the guy was legit.

You realize that they pay for tons of people at the company to travel correct? Like engineers, finance, HR, all of these people have corporate credit cards and receive per deim on business trips, as well as hotel and airfare.  At the companies I've worked for engineers and field service workers incur WAY more travel and expenses than our CEO and CFO do in a given year, I think you have a very negative view of corporations for some reason, and yes it's your choice to get out of them if you'd like, I guess if you're currently working for a corporation my question would be why? I would suspect it's because even with all of your complaints they pay more and offer more benefits than a ma and pa company and more than you would make starting your own business.  Now I'm not saying there isn't wasted money, there is at every company.  For example at a previous company of mine I worked in the tax dept and because California is going broke, if you need a tax refund from a city bye to overpayment or double payment mistakes, it will trigger a county and state audit automatically and they drag it out for 5+ years, where my company has literally been owed $1.8M and due to the added costs of the audit process refused to go after the refund because of the expenses they would incur for the near decade it would take to get their tax refund, so they write it off as a loss (wasted money).  A lot of executives are meeting with political officials and lobbying them to gain more business, it's all part of the game.  If politicians weren't corrupt there wouldn't be a reason to travel to see them.  Most companies have a "lobbying fund" and at my current company all managers and executives are required to contribute 10% of their pay to the company lobbying fund.  I know there are ALOT of corporate haters out there, and I understand since you hear mainly the negative side of things but until you've been in meetings with the CEO and CFO of major companies and understood the decisions they have to make and how those decisions impact the lives of over 100,000 people because if the company goes under so do those jobs, the stress they face,  the sacrifice they make to be away from their families because they're on call 24/7 and work 18+ hours a day 365 days a year sometimes just sleeping in their offices for an hour or two and back to grinding, it's not as glamorous a life as you think. So yeah, they earn the first class seat and a nice dinner, and some good pay.  They have way more to manage and their decisions are way more impactful to way more people than your job and mine, unless you're the CEO of a company at which case you know what I'm talking about.  When was the last time a decision you made impacted the lives of over 200K people not including their families...
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:55:13
Yeah I personally don’t understand the paying off your mortgage. Interest rates are so low it’s practically free money over the course of 30 years.  Pay a little extra on top and that balance drops substantially.  I’ve been rounding my mortgage payment to the nearest whole dollar and after 6 years I only have 15 years left on it.  Also your payment still exists to some degree, I mean you’re paying property taxes and more than likely insurance if you just paid off your house you don’t want it to burn down and not be able to get another, that would be a waste of 21 BTCs.  
And if you’re just going to buy back into BTC then it doesn’t make sense to have sold your current stash bc your monthly income doesn’t change.  If the $800 you were putting towards mortgage is now towards new BTC purchases, you could’ve held your 21BTCs worth roughly 200K, hoped for a measly 15% annual return from BTC which is LOW given its track record and made 30K a year the next couple years, the money you used on your mortgage has now paid it down even more while your BTC stash has grown so maybe now you only owe 185K and your 21BTCs are worth 285K. 
I mean cudos to you for being disciplined and doing what you felt made you happy, and maybe bitcoin tanks to zero and we look back on you as a genius, I just don’t see how I could sell at this moment if I had that many BTCs. With the CME futures on the horizon, continued global awareness and acceptance, and a potential ETF coming, it is an interesting decision to 100% leave.

LOL working hard is the equivalent to greed now? So Elon Musk is greedy that's why he's doing all the work he's doing, and Jeff Bezos he's greedy as well? So you complain that you don't get enough money, enough benefits, enough retirement from a company, well why do you need that money? Isn't that your greed? I have seen plenty of people live off of next to nothing, but you are so greedy you work at a corporation to make that big paycheck so you can get the retirement benefits to not have to work anymore...so to quote you I would say it's your own damn fault you are working at a corporation.  Make money elsewhere, you don't have to work for a corporation, you can start your own business, you can work for a ma and pa company, you can live on welfare, you can live in the woods, the only reason you're at a corporation is your consumption habits and your greed that you want to retire and be able to pay your mortgage, car, golf, or not work for 35+ years of retirement, but somehow you want others to sacrifice and pay you more so you can selfishly do what you want earlier.  I feel sorry for you and your view of the world and the people in it, your only care seems to be your own agenda and getting you further on the backs or dimes of others...you sound like those CEOs/people you despise.

So...I'll start by saying I'm a libertarian, but I struggle to see the pro-heroin equivalent to pro-CP possession legalization.  
The act of injecting yourself with heroin effects nobody but yourself, now how you acquire funds for injecting yourself can harm people, but the creation of heroin also doesn't harm anyone. 
The act of possessing CP might not effect anyone, and it may free or low cost to acquire, but the act of creating it does.  
A real equivalent argument would have to be for something that doesn't harm anyone but the user, or if the creation of heroin involved the victimization of everyone that creates it, as the children in CP with whatever they're forced to do will more than likely develop some form of mental issues from this, thus as a libertarian doesn't make sense to defend as it infringes on the liberties at the expense of someone else.
So, the only true equivalent of that type of argument would be if both using effected only the user, which in this case it does, AND the creation effects nobody, which for heroin it does and CP it does not, then the only variable is how you acquire funds for it which is irrelevant bc if the same person needed both and both ere the same price they would acquire funds the same way...working or stealing.  
Basically Vitalik trying to defend Ver and company under the guise of libertarianism is bogus, and he's doing it for the funding and corruption that greed creates, just my opinion, could be wrong.

This is absolutely true, and they’ll prob take the “lobbying fees” in BTC so they can keep it anonymous in hopes the other party legalized it so they can blame them for supporting criminals or something.  Ahhh the struggle to be a corrupt politician

Oh no it's not a big deal to purchase stocks and other investing tools,my question was do you think in the future there will be an exchange where I invest directly BTC into AAPL stock, and when I receive dividends if I don't opt for dividend reimbursement if I would be paid back out in equivalent BTC or will I have to flip flop from Fiat to BTC and back and forth just to invest in an interest bearing asset.

Maybe they'll conclude with something about it.

Great mindset, that's what Warren Buffett does he says don't ever sell.  I'll tell you I starting slowly putting money in back in 2013, and I purchased a Bitcoin at $800, thinking it was moonbound...like a month or two later it was at $200-250.  I was wicked frustrated, could've had 4 at the price, and was worried it was going to crash and I would lose my money.  I stayed disciplined, and HODL'd and now I'm happy I did, but there was a long period of sub-800 that I've been stressed and my wife was going to kill me...she's much happier about it now though. Stay disciplined

I have a website, but difficult to bring traffic to a specific community.  I mean I sell cars for cash no problem, just looking at trying to sell for cryptocurrency as well, instead of just converting it after the sale.

I mean even at $100 a person that's $120M, I think it is impactful, you have to start somewhere.

Im the owner of Any Budget Cars in West Melbourne, FL 32904 and we also accept BTC and ETH as payments.  We specialize in $3,500 and under vehicles so we don’t have any Lambos on site, but if you’re looking for a car for less than a BTC we got ya covered.  Not sure how to get myself added to the list, but figured I’d through it out there.

Yep I'm on OpenBazaar

Which is why now most senior adults have to rely on social security instead of saving their money throughout their lifetime.

In what world is it 35% maybe if you are earning north of $1,000,000 a year for the rest of the population it’s closer to 15%-20%

What are the rules on "reaching" for it...
@_date: 2016-07-03 22:07:32
Yeah they're incredible, I live in cape canaveral, so I watch almost every one and it never gets old
@_date: 2016-07-03 14:13:07
They eliminate all incentive of reaching if I can't touch.
@_date: 2016-07-02 00:33:26
Very good information I appreciate it and will take a look
@_date: 2016-07-03 12:27:52
Oh interesting, yes I have a Roth  IRA with GBTC, but due to its over valued price and the potential emergence of COIN, I'd rather have the actual coins to reduce my risk of GBTC going back to its actual value

Thanks I was curious myself.
@_date: 2013-05-09 20:21:00
Yeah this will definitely build confidence in the idea, as well as increase the awareness.  I just found out about bitcoins a few days ago, and the more I read the more I like.

We need a Bitcoin Island!
