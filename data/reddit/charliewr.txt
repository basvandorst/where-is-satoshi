I agree. I wish this sub had fewer empty platitudes and more meaningful info. Even funny memes are better than vacuous soundbites like this tweet.

Have faith. Bitcoin has thrived despite a lot worse.

I'm much more irritated by all the panic caused by an issue which should absolutely not be causing any panic than I am by Roger Ver or Coinbase's recent actions. BTC is down because people are panicking, not because Roger Ver or Coinbase is trying to destroy BTC.
We need to stop being so rabidly against any other crypto and realise we're all on the same side. BTC happens to be where I've invested the most. Let's hope for the best for ETH, LTC and yes, BCH and create a rich, nuanced environment. 
For the value of BTC to increase. We do not require all others to fail. Quite the opposite - we just need to be advocates for blockchain and crypto in general.

That's just not true at all. It would be a zero sum game if growth of one currency required another to shrink.

Heh, I know, thanks to my obsessive compulsive coinbase refreshes.
I think 12k within a few days is very plausible! 11.5 already!

They've clearly created their own [wikipedia page]( too, can we take this down?

I'll try, but I'm far below the average for this sub in terms of how well-educated I am. Pointing out shit content isn't necessarily unproductive.

I'm sitting here with 0.1 refreshing coinbase every 15 mins

I added tags calling the neautrality of the article into question.
