I have not seen any transactions from Bitcoin despite supporting it as a payment method for my in-game content on InWorldz. I have seen in other non-crypto currencies however. I'm not convinced there is that big of a Bitcoin gamer user base as you make it out to be.

You literally described the modern datacenter industry.


It's pretty common in datacenters, not to get rid of existing working systems until the cost associated with them becomes higher than simply replacing them. This is why it's still not that uncommon to find 90s Nortel VOIP systems sitting in racks, despite the fact that more modern systems are available, can do significantly more, handle significantly more and take up less space. It costs more money to purchase and implement them than the space cost to use the existing, outdated systems.

Still, at that point you've got Internet access... The original poster was talking about blockchain based solutions that won’t require internet access...

I don't really see a reason why you couldn't have your own local block chain?
I just don't see a local blockchain being usable outside of the local area without some sort of connectivity. With Internet access being so ubiquitous and bridges to it are supported over so many different mediums. If you can't get Internet access, it's indicative that you don't have any sort of realistic network connectivity regardless.
If you're going to have a satellite link, then you've got Internet, which in turn means none of this that the original poster mentioned matters.

That would still require connectivity though to update... The original poster talked about blockchain based solutions that won’t require internet access.
If you still have to have connectivity some of the time, it's still required. Just not "always on".

You can get Internet over most digital mediums, including "radio and/or satelite" too. If that were an option, they would have Internet connectivity already.

The places I'm thinking of that don't have Internet access also don't have mobile signal.

How do you prevent double spending if it's not networked?
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:52:55


I read about it, it "broadcasts the Bitcoin blockchain from space", but does not solve the double spending issue as people can still have double spent without having updating the "wider" Bitcoin blockchain, making double spending still possible. And, they can't update the "wider" network as they don't have connectivity, just view a feed from a satellite of the latest block chain.

If someone sells me a product or service and tells me it "won't require Internet access", I don't assume I need Internet access some of the time, I genuinely would expect it wouldn't need Internet access ever.
I don't really know why you would read it any other way, that person is selling the idea of alternative technologies and I am just confused about how that would work the way stated.

Yeah, I'm not really that worldly.
