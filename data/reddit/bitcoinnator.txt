Your account was flagged. You need to keep trying to contact them and ask them to remove the red flag. I know because the same thing happened to me. The way the account gets a security flag to me is unknown but they told me once it has to do with their security system it is just automatic.
So ask then why did the transaction got canceled and whether they can WHITE FLAG your account so you can complete the transaction.
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:37:05
Oh, well that's good news.

Yes, the pool has to provide the pool address located in a different geographical location.
For example, BTCGuild.com has stratum pool servers in the US and in Europe.
So if you want to change geographical location, just change the pool address from where you want to mine.
Now looking at your question from a different angle, you might mean, whether you can change your own location.
Well yes, you can just move all your bitcoin mining equipment to another location and still mine from the same address. Dido, simple as that.
The other angle of your question is:
You can mine from any where. Your coins found in your mining pool balance account don't have any usefulness or any value unless you send them to place where you can use them, like buying a product, or service, or exchange them for cash.
Now if you looking to change your CURRENCY, for instance, where you live you might be using US Dollars. But you want to get lets say, CHINESE YEN, well you will have to move to china for you to have a bank account that accepts Chinese Yen.
You cannot be located in the US and expect to deposit Australian or Canadian, or Chinese Yen money into your US Account.
So you might want to think about changing your location.
But you could though.
Lets say, that you live in the US and have relatives in Australia. You could move with them, and start a Australia bank account so you can deposit your money in Australian currency.
If I didn't quite answer your question, please be more specific.

Bitcoin hardware wallet not with a raspberry pi like piper
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:38:59
well, I am referring to Coinbase, could this glitch that happen about an hour ago be a compromise?
@_date: 2014-01-01 17:07:50
I purchased 1 year hosting contract. But in their FAQs page, they said that they will ship the hardware to kcmocolo.com but that company is out of service.
So they don't have a way of hosting the hardware.
@_date: 2014-01-01 14:07:55
kcmocolo.com is out of business. So to where is BFL going to deliver the hardware to. For instance, in the past they would deliver the hardware to kcmocolo.com and they would reference your order to your contract, that way your hosting contract would start running.
But now, since kcmocolo.com has gone off business, BFL has not posted any updates as to what other company is the one that will do the hosting.
Hopefully I can get my money back...
netsolus.com said that, they run hosting for BFL hardware that you purchase yourself and then deliver to them.
But that, they don't have any set arrangement with BFL for BFL to deliver hardware to netsolus.com for hosting.
So, I wonder if my 1 year contract is hanging on a threat?

Whatever you do dont use mtgox you will never get your money

troll reported
@_date: 2014-01-28 21:03:24
Bad mojo.
@_date: 2014-02-24 15:37:17
hate to break it to you again, but your coins are gone...mtgox going bankrupt is like closing the account where you keep your bitcoins...which means there is no way of claiming your account balance....oh look, smoke where bitcoins used to be...gone!!!!
@_date: 2014-01-01 15:34:47
The point is that the company that BFL suppose to deliver the mining hardware to, kcmocolo.com is no longer in service. Therefore, is no way to know whether BFL will host the miners themselves or are they going to refer another company. When you type kcmocolo.com in you browser, it redirects to another website: netsolus.com, which host hardware, but netsolus.com customer service said, and I quote, "BFL will not be delivering hardware to them for hosting..."
That's the point and that's the problem, if you understand it. What the other person said in the previous post, was that he purchased a hosting contract, did not received any feed back, and BFL has not responded any emails.
So far, I have contacted them, and they still have not responded my emails either. And don't even try their phone, they have an automated machine that does not connect to customer service, it leaves you hanging.
So the question is, if BFL fails to provide the service one purchase, you should be able to sue...
@_date: 2014-01-01 15:16:22
I believe you should sue.
The fact that they did not provide the service they sold you, in your case, it is not preemption...it is course of matter of the fact that they sold you something and they did not provide product.
I say sue them too.
@_date: 2014-02-24 16:11:11
hate to burst everyone's bubble, but I don't think that's going to happen...
If you read other posts about gox resign the BF and deleting their tweets, that's a sign they are going bankrupt...
@_date: 2014-01-01 01:59:28
Your best bet is going with mtgox bitcoin exchange. There you can purchase bitcoin with more freedom. Make sure use 2 factor authentication with password.
My best personal advice is dont invest more than what you are willing to lose. Bitcoin is not a wi win business if you looking to just find the quickest way to transfer money without a feed.
Another thing about mtgox they got the highest buy/selling bitcoin exchange prices.
You got to look at it this way:
1. If you bought bitcoin at obo 850 us dollars and the prices go down. You have not lost your entire invest unless you sell at the lower price then your initial purchase.
2. If you bought bitcoin a obo 850 and when you settle in the US prices go up. You still might have a lost if you purchased with australian dollars and now are selling in USD.
3. Take great measure into the difference in investment when you are converting from AUSD to Bitcoin and then to USD. You can take hit if prices dont go as high as you expect.
One last thing about mtgox is to make sure utility bills where you live in australia are under your name so that you can verify your identity and then be able to make transaction else you could end putting your money in a pit and cannot retrieve.
 Else go with coinbase.com but they have lower bitcoin selling price which means you would likely be at a lost.
Other than that goodluck remember it just money talk to people before doing anything stupid.
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:44:23
maybe it happened to my account only...
I already contact coinbase, and hopefully they can explain what happened.
I will post what they say.
@_date: 2014-01-25 22:51:32
running the recovery software will not solve the issue.
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:58:28
It is happening again...
I already submitted screen pictures of the glitch to coinbase, maybe they do something about it.
@_date: 2014-01-28 21:00:04
Yeah, there is no source.
I just spoke with customer service, they said, that if amazon is planning, or it is announcing, that amazon would have already posted a press release in their website. And I found no press release.
So this post is bogus, and just presumptuous.
@_date: 2014-02-24 15:16:55
You are just another sheep too...look at the drastic move mtgox is taking by resigning bitcoin foundation, deleting all their tweets, and then what, closing business without resolving the issue at hand, making everyone lose their investment.
Open up your mind, mtgox fucked up! big time.
@_date: 2014-02-05 00:32:46
It might be just me, but your action is just going to make him spend the bitcoins and claim he used it for the some project...later on you will withdraw your lawsuit and then, the other bogus project was never made, which will cause you again to bring up the issue, and start yet another lawsuit...I see deja vu
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:35:58
Oh, well. Fortunately I never got to use it, so I didn't know.
I thought it was an exchange like Coinbase or Mtgox, etc.
Well that's good news, because if it had been an exchange, people would've lost big time with their bitcoins lacked up in their accounts.
@_date: 2014-01-01 17:38:33
Oh, ok.
@_date: 2014-01-23 18:50:56
oh, I see.
I hope that that guy that want to transfer his house deposit from Australia is not using Mtgox for that.
He will lose all his money I suppose.
@_date: 2014-01-22 10:04:54
no, the whole purpose of the blockchain is also to be anonymous, so the code is made that way. If you like you can go to github and do a fork on the code to see have that update, but once you do, bitcoin prices will go down, because people will be afraid of that.
@_date: 2014-01-06 19:56:31
I have spoke with the IRS, and they said, as a miner, and I sell my bitcoin, is not consider capital gain or taxable income. Why as you said, you are a Tax Attorney you are coming up with this assumption?
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:45:41
Is not about fear. Is about your savings...if suddenly your bank account shows you have a million dollars, wouldn't you ask your bank whats going on?
@_date: 2014-01-23 18:54:09
what do you mean?
Do you use mtgox and get your dollar withdrawals.
@_date: 2014-02-05 10:23:49
Well there goes the whole inchilada...
He seems to be trolling, and not starting the lawsuit to begin with...
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:23:32
You got a point.
But, Coinbase could have thief that's doing the inside job.
Plus let me point out, and it might be a bad idea too to mention this.
Coinbase removed a security feature. Before you can designate an IP from where only you will access your account. But that feature has been removed. Which makes accounts now more vulnerable.
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:49:30
Oh, so the close of shop happened without notice.
That is bad business for the Bitcoin Community.
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:02:50
I do sort blame the guy too for using a pre-generated password as he said, which he also claim was not crackable.
For starters, maybe the whole reason he got hacked is because the hackers new he was using that program and they phished his computer thereby getting access to his password.
