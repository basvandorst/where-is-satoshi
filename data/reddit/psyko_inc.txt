The trick is to either get a lawyer to draw up a trust that the winnings are payable to, and send a representative (possibly the same lawyer) to accept the winnings on behalf of the trust; or if that is not possible do a legal name change, grow out your hair and beard, get some huge 80s dork glasses and a heavy coat to wear for the pictures to obscure your face and body type. Then afterwards, change your name back, cut your hair and shave so that your chances of being recognized are less likely. Then continue your life as normal and don't get all show-offy with the money, and don't talk about it.

You got the amount of BTC you paid for, at the agreed-upon rate.  Coinbase does not control the market price, and everyone who owns BTC took a hit today, including you.  Just ride it out, most of the seasoned veterans here are predicting a rise after this hiccup.

Yep, bought my first $150 worth in Nov at ~$750/BTC, saw the spike over the last few days and bought $100 more at ~$1130/BTC.  Dip started a few hours later, decided to double down and bought another $50 worth at ~$990/BTC. So far my investment isn't doing so hot, but break even for me is at around $890/BTC. I plan on hodling either way.

If it hits a mil, I'll stop hodling.

Since when does buying bitcoins equal money laundering?  And since it's going into/out of a checking account, which is monitored by the bank at the very least, wouldn't that be a really shitty method of money laundering?

Just ride it out man.  I bought yesterday too (only about $100 worth), but planning to ride it out and see where it goes.

They likely get a price break on GCs from Amazon, et. al. There is a good percentage of gift cards that never get redeemed, but they already have their money. So for example, if 20% never get redeemed, they can sell GCs to retailers  at 90% face value with a rule that they can only be sold to the public at face value (to prevent undercutting their own sales), and Amazon is still making a 10% profit. Then the retailers sell at face value, and pay a 3% finance fee from PayPal or a credit card company, and they still make 7%.

Assuming line of credit, probably from home equity or something.

Story time: Friday evening was when BCH started climbing; I correctly recognized it as a pump and dump and started watching it closely. There seemed to be some resistance at around $1k, and it started to dip again. I sold all my BCH at $940 (up from ~$400 a couple days prior) and converted to BTC. Turns out I was too quick on the draw, and the next morning BCH was at ~$2400 while BTC was in a freefall.  Saturday night I had trouble sleeping, constantly checking prices on my phone. I had a dream that BTC went down to $1400 (they say you can't read text in a dream, but I remember it clearly.) Disregarding the temptation to panic sell, I held my position, and today I'm a little above where I was before this whole shit show started. Never let your emotions get mixed up in finance, it only leads to poor decisions.

A coinstar machine that outputs btc? Hell yes, sign me up! I do sorta dislike that it requires a phone number for ID though... Wonder if a Google voice or similar would work?
