Too bad to see Stripe's relationship with bitcoin ending. We decided to use Stripe as our payment processor for our small business because of their connection with crypto. Glad to see they are not completely abandoning the idea of cryptocurrency, though (not many financial companies can ignore at this point to be fair).

can I fourth this question even though I seconded this?
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:25:33
They blamed it on the other bank...total BS though
@_date: 2014-12-25 05:29:04

The author that book also wrote "The Beginner's Guide to Spiritual Warfare" ...so yeah
@_date: 2014-06-11 02:35:43
Yeah, great. Another pain in my ass I wouldn't be dealing with if the exchange happened in Bitcoin.

I can't tell if this is a satire or not

@_date: 2014-12-08 17:50:01
Haha thank you!

You're a neat gentleman.

Why is it always "Gentlemen"
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:39:17
Where else has this been done?

Hello! I hope you're still giving out Pizza. I could really use some right now... I created a petition requesting Amazon accept Bitcoin and got 3000+ signatures on it. 
I can message you for further proof! (I had to delete my old reddit account because of real life circumstances, great story btw)

I should have added more clarification...I meant the total USD ever sent on the blockchain. It sort of looked like a speedometer with trillions of miles on it adding tens of thousands every second.
