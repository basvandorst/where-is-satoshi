About a dollar.

Eh, I'd say now that Bitcoin seems to be struggling slightly on multiple fronts, the people who still have a lot of 'faith' are the 'hardliners'/hardcore adherents, who seem to be very prone to cultish behaviour.

Getting desperate eh, Kim.

Holy shit, what is this obsession that libtards have with using the word 'slavery' in financial context?
@_date: 2015-08-25 10:26:41
It probably will. Let's see at the end of the week.
@_date: 2015-08-12 20:24:58
Helps if you tip more than 50 cents.
@_date: 2015-08-25 06:07:06
It will drop further, so better hold off from buying.
@_date: 2015-08-15 07:56:17
Sorry for your loss man, but damn, you're really kind of stupid when it comes to money.
@_date: 2015-08-14 07:19:52
He's right though. This place is turning more and more into a freaking cult.
@_date: 2015-09-26 14:55:19
Wow what happened here.
@_date: 2015-09-25 19:31:32
I'll call it whatever I like, thanks.

Can the blockchain handle all those millions/billions of IoT transactions though?
@_date: 2015-09-25 19:55:28
Are you stalking me? How did you know my name?
@_date: 2015-09-22 19:02:14
Agreed, definitely won't be ordering any Cisco equipment if they start embedding 21 Inc's crap.
@_date: 2015-09-23 17:19:16
Fair enough, you have to scroll down quite a bit for that blurb though. Even worse on the Amazon page. Everything about the launch and initial presentation screamed it was a consumer product.
@_date: 2015-09-25 18:06:51
As if anyone in here was going to pay for porn, let alone with bit-Coin.
@_date: 2015-09-23 16:38:22
It sure is advertised as being a consumer product.
@_date: 2015-09-23 16:50:16
Nothing on their frontpage (only after scrolling down for a bit) or the Amazon page (again, only after scrolling down) explicitly indicates this is a dev-kit, and that regular customers should not buy it.
Oh, and if it's truly a dev-kit, then this product makes even less sense.
@_date: 2015-09-23 17:18:35
Yep, it's poorly communicated. You have to scroll down quite a bit to read that it's meant for developers. Check out the Amazon page, it's even worse. I'd almost say it's purposely misleading.
@_date: 2015-10-19 07:28:36
Not sure who the idiot is here (hint: not me).
@_date: 2015-10-14 17:19:36
You've been having quite a bit of Schadenfreude lately then, unfortunately.
@_date: 2015-10-16 17:51:18
Good god. I really really hope you don't come to regret that in the future.
