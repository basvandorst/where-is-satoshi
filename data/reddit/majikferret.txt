Sadly I don't have much faith in ppl.The vast majority do not even have a basic understanding of any economic theory, monetary theory,  personal finance, an understanding of how the fractional reserve banking system works, even the diff between wealth and currency! These ppl are the same ppl saying it's worthless as if the dollar isn't just as make pretend/manipulated/devalued and in danger of losing it supremacy. It can be a currency, commodity, wealth store, technology, a trust value, a tool for accountability. We can design and fork it to the rules we want for the society we are, a mistrustful bunch of greedy douches. that's revolutionary... it is possible to be all these. It's duality and eventual application in the future can revolutionize our economic/political systems and institutions of power whether or not the populace understands it. If we let it. The speculative bubble is a symptom of the technology in its infancy and the lack of ppls willingness to be engaged and awake.  We know it special and it's got big implications. I say burn it all down.

Fintech is deff the future and blockchain is part of it. Super fascinating and exciting to see the early adapters and what's on the horizon.  Traditional banking is deff gonna change though.

Why does it seem no one cares or sees the value in the blockchain itself and have a vision and faith for the future...? Ok sure bitcoin may fail but it's legacy and subsequent uses of its protocol whether as a currency or other applications in replacing trust facilitator insitutuions like banks, gov't, traditional accounting and finance.... like jeez ppl take a chill pill and invest responsibly and diversify your crypto. Have faith that's what currency is a faith and trust commodity.

Is there any concern the removal of net neutrality will result in targeted slow downs and price gouging of crypto users and providers? Not sure if this is a silly question or not but I have no one else to ask lol.
