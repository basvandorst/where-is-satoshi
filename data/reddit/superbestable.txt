Well, damn. I didn't know I'd agree with someone on reddit over the Oatmeal thing. For what it's worth, I thought the whole thing was awful - he milked an old fad and people showered him with money.
Although perhaps it's just that it's so difficult to trust many organizations.

You will never convince enough people to get out of the way, because unless you convince absolutely everyone, there will still be someone in the way and it will all be for nothing. (And usually the really big blockers are the ones are the hardest to convince)
Whereas, if instead of lifting all negative and positive influences, you try to balance the negative influences with positive ones by helping those who are blocked get over the block (which cannot be feasibly lifted anyway) then you at least have some hope of success.
The problem with libertarianism is that in practice it's always the easy rules that are lifted, and then it turns out that the rules that were hard to lift are now free to screw everyone over since you've taken out the small ones that were balancing them. (Yeah, fine, get rid of welfare. And who's gonna make sure industry cartels don't undercut their employees, and who's gonna make sure wages track inflation like cost of living does? You're just gonna do the first and then screw up the latter two, and we'll end up with cutthroat employers AND no welfare.)


So how do you expect the US to cope with 500 million Africans and 500 million Chinese suddenly immigrating overnight?

Haha, this is why I love Bitcoin. The drama is really like nothing else! It's like living in a Hollywood fantasy world.
Looks like someone's even made a [bet]( for it! Anyone know where I can buy popcorn in bulk?

No, the government can't just "raise prices" on schools and law enforcement. It will just devolve into the state that it is in in China and Africa and wherever it was that these people tried to *leave* and everyone will lose.

I think he's more sad that people would rather gamble than invest.

Scammers the world over hear about all the credulous fools getting scammed left and right, and say "I gotta get in on that shit!"- that can only be a good thing.

1. Get $1000.
2. Make a new Mt.Gox account.
3. Put in $1000.
4. Buy Bitcoins.
5. Send to self.
6. Send Bitcoins to a second Mt.Gox account.
7. Sell.
8. Withdraw dollars. You now have ~$1000. Go to 2.

Because you live in a fantasy world of sunshine and rainbows.

1. Offer Bitcoin investment funds.
2. Use their substantial funds to speculate on Mt.Gox, manipulate the market and defraud other traders.

4. Act as exchanges.
5. Do their $ transactions in Bitcoin to avoid costs, while still charging customer a transfer fee.
6. Lend out loans and have the resources to legally go after non-payers and absorb the occasional loan.
7. Provide a service where you can withdraw dollars from your Bitcoin account's ATM card.

The fact that the infrastructure was put in place with 300 million in mind, and you're talking about 1.3 billion.
@_date: 2012-09-05 05:24:33


It will overwhelm the infrastructure and then everyone will lose their quality of life.


You're preaching to the choir, and the choir doesn't get to decide this stuff.

Banks do invest their money. They give loans to companies when they think the interest on the loan is a better deal than the projected income from the company's business, and when they can't do the kind of business that the company is able to do (because they don't have people with the right skills).

It appears like 100 BTC have been received by the account and redirected to MtGox several times, presumably for selling and spending. If you do it 1000 times, it will look like you received 100 kBTC in 1000 parts. But you only had 1% of the money.

They will enjoy higher wages and access to better infrastructure (education, health, public transport, law enforcement), as well as less oppression from the government and better protection of their rights. Even working minimum wage, they will do better than Americans because they have grown poor and can "live without" conveniences such as AC and a car, which are practically regarded as inalienable rights by native Americans.


Unfortunately, the rich elite that is actually benefiting from the sawing never wanted to stop it in the first place, so they will make you compromise and do the blunt saw, knowing that it only benefits them even more when you are paralyzed by the pain and defenseless.

I'm not implying it, I'm saying it. Bitcoin is unique, because it is full of gullible fools (what other currency has such a large fraction circulating in Ponzi schemes?) and nobody is regulating it so there's no repercussions to criminal actions.
Bad publicity is bad if it preferentially attracts scammers. Nobody wants an economy full of scammers. They make it hard to do legitimate business.

I agree with you. It seems like people would rather follow their greed and try to defraud others (or perhaps they actually did believe it wasn't a Ponzi?) than invest in something in something real.
I think the degree of wild speculation, and moreover using BTC as proxy for real world (ie in the dollar economy) financial speculation (which is what the HYIPs were supposedly doing) is damaging to the BTC economy. Perhaps some kind of protectionist system could be put in place, or perhaps we can somehow make the speculators obsolete or at least reduce their effect. Or maybe we should just take the liquidity they bring and be thankful you can always find a bid or ask on MtGox.
The thing about investing in startups vs. gambling, perhaps it's just that it's hard for people to convince themselves that startups could deliver a return than it is to convince themselves that they *know* just what this bet will come out to be. Perhaps it has to do with trusting someone else's idea rather than yours.
By the way, what kind of development do you do, OP?
