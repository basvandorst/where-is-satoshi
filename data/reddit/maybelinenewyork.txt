Whales are moving large amounts of money. We are entering deeper waters now. Some institutional investors are pulling their money out. The end is near? I guess so.

Nobody uses it to store wealth. Gold is used to store wealth because it's stable. As is money on a bank account. Btc is used to speculate. But it has no underlying value cause it has no use case. So it can only go to a certain point with speculation. Until people realize it has no use case and pull their money out. That's what's happening now. I hope you understand the fundemental flaw of btc. Funny idea, blockchain will be usefull, but btc has no future cause it has no use case (not a mean to store wealth, no future as a currency because of volatility).

That's why all the early miners are selling. Pretty much over for btc.

I accepted I will lose all the money I put into btc and i have peace of mind. It was a great idea but unfortunately it doesn't work. Deep down we all knew it was a failed project. There hasn't been adoption for more than 10 years (it isn't used). The fundementals just aren't right. Something that doesn't work can be written off. Its value goes to zero and that's what's happening now. I don't like things that aren't useful, nobody likes things that aren't useful, and btc is just not useful. Everyone saying 'but it's a store of value' is fooling himself. Something that loses 90 percent of its value in one week is NOT a store of value. It's a dangerous liability and should be banned from public space.

This is actually good for Bitcoin. The real value is around one dollar. All currencies are around one dollar. Going back to 1-2 dollars and staying there will mean adoption.

Its going to take more than 5 to 10 years before there's a turning point, if and only if btc somehow proves to be valuable. It is going to a price of approximately 400-500 and could even go lower.

Crypto area is over, that's pretty obvious. Been telling alle year that this was the bubble, pretty much like the .com bubble. There is no company worth 200 billion without a use case. It's over for the coming ten years, and btc might never return to previous ath, because it has no use case. Everyone knew this beforehand, but gambling is addictive.
