Not enough arbitrage seekers?

I don't know what you would consider a low fee, but currently you'd probably need to pay over $20 to get a transaction to clear in even 3-4 days.

It's definitely not *almost certain*. The max winnings per bet is just 0.5% of the bank roll. Someone would need a very large amount of capital *and* be extremely lucky to break the bank. The likelihood of breaking the bank is pretty small.
The risk to investors is more from hackers or the site owner walking away with everything.

Roughly $100k.

It's not a floor. It's below $10k right now.
Edit: Not any more...
Edit 2: Back under $10k...
Super volatile. I will refrain from more edits.

It's back under $10,000 again at the moment...

Yeah, at least 10-20 hours a week of productive time (work or hobby) is needed for me to stay mentally healthy.

Depends on how broken. Quantum computing, for example, would weaken it but not completely break it, I think.

What are you talking about? The market has been very bullish this year.

Did they? I thought I heard at least a couple ended up in jail.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:57:04
Thanks for that. Do you know if that was before RICO was an option?

You go after what you can prove most easily. If that's enough to put him away forever, the prosecution is satisfied.
Isn't there a famous mob boss who finally got nailed with tax evasion instead of all the more heinous crimes? Same deal here, I'd imagine.
