i agree its going to drop back out of the 7's but i dont see it going down that far at this point. more and more people are watching and will start buying like crazy if it gets close to 5.

ok thanks. i understand what market vs limit orders are already so ill be looking to use gdax for my purchases then.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:34:27
cool thanks man. i went ahead and pulled the trigger on one.

right now Coinbase/Gdax is a steaming pile of shit to me. my funds were taken from my checking acfount last thursday and still havent been posted to my account on coinbase/gdax.
i am super fucking pissed.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:44:34
its been since monday when i applied for the deposit. the money came out of my checking account this morning and coinbase is still saying that its pending.
theyre slow as shit.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:47:01
just checked my bank account and theres a 2nd withdrawal this morning taken out of my checking account. i did ask for each one but now theres a couple grand of my money somewhere in limbo. my balance on Coinbase remains at zero.
i see what youre saying but this shit is so frustrating.
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:54:13
i have no idea if i need one of these.
im in the middle of buying some bitcoin and ethereum but dont plan on spending for awhile..maybe after 8 months. should i get this or stick to an online wallet?

today my credit union refused a wire transfer to my gemini account because they see them as high risk. i told them that its my money so let me do wtf i want with it.
ive been trying to get invested into this for several weeks now and it is frustrating as all hell playing this game already..

hey im from the present. let us buyers cash in a little bit so we can feel like were winning too
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:41:07
it just dipped hard from 82 to 78..
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:10:17
i have a question about Coinbase/Gdax if someone could help.
regarding limits. they both say that i have a weekly maximum limit. does that mean if i max it out now that ill have to wait a full 7 days or do they go by a Monday through Sunday type system?
also, if i max out my limit in the Gdax website, will that also max out my limit on my Coinbase app?

ublock origin(mobile) blocked whatever they had just fine. looks like a normal ad free website to me.

newbie here(2 days)..
can someone ELI5 the Lightning Network along with its pros and cons for Bitcoin please?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:17:08
i think itll be back in the lower 6000's or more by then but wtf do i know.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:14:23
its at 5900 right now. id go ahead and buy already but i need to wait for my checking account to tell me what the verification deposits are.
i have no choice but to wait until monday it seems.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:10:47
jesus h fucking christ coinbase is pissing me off. ive been ready to buy since last friday and im still sitting around waiting for my funds to get out of pending. they came out of my bank this morning and im ready to buy now. still no money in my account.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:19:24
anyone want to help me out here?
i have a Coinbase with Gdax accounts online. i havent verified my checking account yet as im waiting for the verification deposits.
it seems they have amount limits up to 2,000usd to purchase bitcoin and such.
first i want to know is, do i use Coinbase or Gdex to buy bitcoin? second, how do i spend more then 2,000 if thats the limit? i have more then that in my savings and am prepared to dump it into bitcoin soon.
hope someone could give some advice.
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:46:04
do you see the current price correcting back down to the 4's or 5's?
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:05:09
would it be counted as a bubble if Bitcoin dropped back down to the 3-4 thousands in the near future? i know very little but believe that thats a very real possibilty.
the article seems to be pretty legit but what hes talking about applies to all cryptocurrency. im ready to make some significant investments but not quite ready to pull the trigger right at this moment.
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:14:13
can you explain a bit more please? i dont know what fiat is..
when you say trade, do mean buy cryptocurrency with usd on gdax?
