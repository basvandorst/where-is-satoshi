You're right. If Bitcoin clients allowed for easy exporting of private keys (e.g. showed QR codes of them when the client was open), or users were commonly (or high-profile users were) accidentally exposing their private keys, that would be considered a vulnerability. But clients provide reasonable protections against that, because if they didn't, it would be a vulnerability.
In the same way, transaction malleability is not a vulnerability *if clients reasonably protect against it*. But they clearly aren't, and so it is currently a vulnerability.

But those addresses get or spend money in the same transactions or to the same addresses. If I know address A belongs to you, and I see it in a transaction sending coins to BitPay along with address B, it's pretty easy to now say that address B is also yours. So your coins are pseudonymous at rest, but when you actually use them, much of that protection goes away.
There are things like coinjoin that tries to thwart this, but it still doesn't make such analysis impossible. The anonymity sets for something like that are still pretty small, and to a company trying to track users, might not matter all that much in aggregate.

Because the blockchain contains millions of addresses, this process will be slow. For example, say I guess "correct horse battery staple", and put it through the brainwallet algorithm. I get a bitcoin address out of that, and have to compare that address against the list of addresses I pulled from the blockchain. If there's a match, I can steal the funds. There are efficient ways to do that comparison (e.g. hash table), but it is even more efficient to only check if that address matches a single address (e.g. the 1E9jy9337 one provided by jron).
The problem is that if you tell me a particular address is a brainwallet with a weak passphrase (and you aren't lying), then you cut down the amount of work I have to do. I no longer have to compare each brute force attempt against a list of millions of addresses. I only have to compare against the one provided. It also removes some uncertainty; I know it is possible to crack, and I know the reward that I will get if I do so.

How are cubesats going to transmit data that can be picked up by anyone? My experience with cubesats has been that there are only a few dozen places on earth that can receive data from their very-weak, non-orientable radios. Also, why should I trust that the cubesat hasn't been duped in the sybil attack?
This sounds like more centralization, not less. How is this any better than me signing blockchain updates with a trusted key and broadcasting it to the network?

I'm not sure I understand this. So you VPN to hidemyass.com, and then use that to l33t h4x some website. Website files a complaint for the source IP, which is hidemyass.com's VPN exit. Law enforcement subpoena's hidemyass.com for the IP responsible for the requests in question. hidemyass hands over your IP (or your neighbors IP, wherever you came from).
You're right nothing is foolproof, but why does something that falls apart with a single subpoena make you feel safer than an overlay network run across many jurisdictions and is known to be incapable of responding to the subpoena's in the first place?
Don't get me wrong, Tor is not without it's fair share of attacks, for example traffic correlation or infection of the browser, but these are also attacks possible for VPNs.

The 1.5% per day isn't compelling evidence?
I've been graphing my return from ghash.io for a few months now. At current exponential growth, I believe it will not pay for itself, ever.
Another calculation I did about a month or two ago was to say I bought a 5TH/s rig, and tried to solo mine. If the network hash rate were consistent (45k TH/s at the time), I'd expect to solo mine a block in about 2 months. However, given a 1.5% daily growth in hash rate, the math comes out to about a 35% chance that I don't mine a block...ever. That means my expected value asymptotes to about 65% of the reward of a block, or about $7k. So after it has mined forever, it will have made about $7k, minus initial investment (and electricity if you're into that).
Edit: Note that this rig just about breaks even (maybe does a little better even), but that is because it is making 1.5% per day. I would consider people to have larger rigs than that a few months ago to be big players, though ymmv.
Curious what your observations are.
@_date: 2014-05-26 22:43:01


Yes, those both make a difference. Maybe "the good of bitcoin" is not worth 1% of MY profits. If you still think 1% doesn't make a huge difference, let's make a deal: I'll switch from mining on Ghash.io to another pool of your choice if you personally make up the difference.

I think this is the way to go as well; 2-of-3 P2SH, with private keys on computer, smartphone, and backup paper wallet(s).
The trouble I currently see is in how you do the actual communication between devices. How do I communicate the partial redeem script from my smartphone to the computer (or that the smartphone should perform such an action in the first place)? There are a bunch of out-of-band communication options (e.g. QR codes, networking) but it has to work reliably in practice under a bunch of different conditions (e.g. no camera, or one/both devices behind different NATs).
Is there a way to communicate such partial redeem scripts through the blockchain/P2P network of bitcoin?

Why use bitcoin for that? Are you aware that most (if not all) long-running VPN services keep network logs, and hand them over on subpoena? Even if we assume bitcoin were anonymous, it's still possible to trace the login to your computer (or a second VPN that also traces to your computer).

The address is exactly what allows me to know when I've guessed the correct phrase. I could try this against all addresses in the blockchain, but now I only have to check against this one instead of several million for each guess. I don't have incentive to do that though, because I don't want to steal the funds.
@_date: 2014-04-17 05:05:49
For non-technical people, it's very easy to understand the concept of forged cash. There are things they have learned to look for (feel the paper, look for a watermark), and some people do this, making it uncertain for a particular counterfeiter if they will get away or be caught. On the counterfeiting side, fake cash is expensive to make individually, which is why you don't check £5 notes; it costs more to counterfeit them than the amount you'd get from them.
With bitcoin double spends it's different. The merchant looks at the computer, and if the computer says it's ok, they accept it. This leaves no uncertainty for the attacker - they know ahead of time if their attack will work or if it won't. It's also cheaper to perform, because of the incentives for the counterfeiters (miners) that get a kickback from providing that service in aggregate; bits are cheaper to create and modify than forged paper currency.

I run a node at my university, which the university knows about. The university gets abuse complaints occasionally, which they forward to me. These are generally automated emails produced from IDSes, although occasionally someone angry emails complaining about how terrible Tor is. I have not received any credible legal threats, and have not had any interaction with law-enforcement concerning the exit node or the traffic it produces, though we've only been running it for about 4 months, so time will tell :)

I think the largest problem is how do you prevent Sybil attacks? Say you run a full node, and I run 10 full nodes on the same machine. Should I get 10 times as much reward as you?
@_date: 2014-05-13 05:02:42
Bitcoin already supports reward for running a full node, it's called mining.
The reason this isn't working out so great is because everyone wanted in, and the mining network hashrate grew at ~1.5% PER DAY for the last year. That means if you weren't making back more than 1.5% of your investment every day (and you probably weren't), during that time period, chances are you haven't made back your initial investment. Bitcoin mining is horribly oversubscribed such that only a few big players are actually making money. This might have to do with people buying in knowing they wouldn't make it back just for the experience, or it might have to do with typical human hubris, greed, and miscalculation, e.g "If the network stays at it's current difficulty, I'll make back my investment in 1-2 months!"
Any kind of "reward for running a full node" is going to require Sybil attack prevention, or some way to at least make the Sybil attack "fair" (as Bitcoin does). Currently, the best way we know how to do this is proof of work, which is how we ended up with this ASIC-ridden race-to-the-bottom mining world.
If you think about it, Bitcoin doesn't really try to prevent Sybil attacks, in the sense that miners become more powerful by having faster SHA-256 computation. Every additional GH/s allows you to "pretend" to be more nodes and get a bigger slice of the pie; it's just everyone agrees that's how it should work, so we don't call it an attack. It's not clear that any Proof of Resource can do much better than simply requiring your proof that you have some resource to essentially be "do some calculation/communication/storage that requires you to use that resource", which is a bit like saying "prove to me you have $5 by giving me $5."
So we've gotten to a point where most miners are losing money, which makes people upset and scared about the future of bitcoin; will people panic and sell and get what they can? Will they abandon it for more profitable alt-coins? Probably some will.
But This Is Actually A Good Thing(TM), because it means there exists an equilibrium, where beyond a certain growth rate, the market simply doesn't provide rational incentive to continue joining. The network doesn't require that hashrate continues to grow at ~1.5% per day, or even that it grows at all. It only requires that it's difficult for someone to suddenly join with a significant fraction of the hash rate.
So I think you're going to get a lot of "yes, please give me more free money!" responses, but we're sort of learning the obvious here: there exists some limit after which each additional node/miner/verifier provides marginal value to the network, and thus gets marginal reward. The same is probably going to be true for any proof of work. A proof of resource that doesn't require you to actually use the resource might have different properties, but if someone can "prove" (or pretend to prove) they have more of a resource by using it, we end up back where we started.

That's not really hypocritical, unless he's banking on them being a major investment for him. Would you prefer he had opinions about bitcoins without ever having used them?
@_date: 2014-05-26 19:11:37
But a pool will do merged mining with other altcoins, making it more profitable for the same amount of work.
Also the fees are much lower for a larger pool, so while in theory your argument is right, in practice it is not.

And the OP has pointed out that this one is weak. So I simply put it into the password cracker and get the pass phrase, and claim the coins.
@_date: 2014-04-17 05:07:46
It matters because it makes such attacks more certain and automatic. It also insulates the big-time counterfeiters (miners) who get the aggregate profits from the small-time thieves who face smaller individual risk.

Isn't the hoarding argument that once 21 million bitcoins are produced, people will start hoarding? We haven't gotten there yet; we're still in an inflationary period, so any data on existing hoarding doesn't really "demolish the Bitcoin hoarding argument".

But transaction fees aren't zero, so in Bitcoin you're paying the miners. There's always a middle man somewhere.
@_date: 2012-09-10 16:34:46
How is this an effective form of washing? If you keep clicking on the address that receives the bulk of the ~8k BTC, you end up with a second address in each transaction that gets about 0.1 - 20 BTC. If you were to make a list of each of these second addresses, you would get a list of addresses that either got paid, or is another address belonging to the original person.
For example,  would likely pop up several times in that list, and is likely owned by the original source.

Do people not realize that Bitcoin has been inflating at an average rate of well over 4% for the past year due to mining rewards? Bitcoin won't be a deflationary currency for several more years to come, and its inflation rate is more than twice that of the US Dollar. Whatever value gain Bitcoin has, it isn't due to deflation.

It's not just delaying propagation, it's giving your private pool an advantage by making the public do work that is ultimately wasted (e.g. mine on a dead fork).

Monopolies are terrible for business in general, which is why many countries have anti-monopoly laws to prevent them from taking advantage of people. But monopolies do form, often in spite of negative public perception (AT&amp;T, for example, in it's prime was fairly unanimously hated). Monopolies basically call our bluff -- "what are you going to do, not use the telephone?" In a bitcoin mining monopoly, the bluff they'd call is: "what are you going to do, go back to using cash/debit cards from a monopoly of big banks?" You might argue that users would start another alt-currency, but that ignores the self-interest of the bitcoin users who are also going to want prices to stay high (until they sell, of course), so they'll begrudgingly go along with the mining monopoly.
The whole point of tragedy of the commons is that there is some greater or often nebulous good (cleaner air; trust in a distributed system) that are sacrificed for continuous short-term and rational benefits (faster to drive than take the bus; higher ROI for buying BTC than mining rigs).
