Running a full node prevents you from receiving transactions in a fake block during a 51% attack. 
1) Why would they create a fake block when they could just reorg using a valid block and double spend and then also collect mining rewards
2) The cost of identity theft after a hack on the central email server is probably higher and more likely than a 51% attack on Bitcoin while you've spent in the last few minutes.

Email wouldn't of caught on if everyone was pushed into running a email server.

How am I gonna verify that the token given to me is really a valid token and not just some fake? It seems the only way to do that is to have the entire (un-hashed) chain of transactions right back to the issuer. In which case how is it private?

"If the token represents some external asset (e.g. land, fiat, development hours etc), then you trust that the party backing the external asset will give it to you. It's the same for any token on Ethereum, for example."
You're missing the point. Tokens redeeming external assets are still traded and the trading between consumers is not secure.
" going all the way back to the original burn transaction. So you can be confident that you are the true owner of the XSPOCT token, because you can validate every transaction up until that point. "  
Ok so we've established this isn't compatible with SPV clients. But it's even worse than that still...how do you validate that coins somewhere along the line haven't been minted from thin air? If the quantities are hashed then how is this possible? What stops me giving someone 10\^6 tokens when I only have 10? 
In the framework you've proposed there is a dichotomy between confidentiality and verifiable conservation of quantity.

I've edited and added a even more vicious attack. Even if (total, e) where e is tiny this would still work.

The word "contest" here is meant to mean exactly what you are describing (I'm using the word exactly as Joseph Poon uses it): " spends Sybil's outputs from the fraudulent close transaction before Sybil is able to (due to nlocktime)."
In the scenario there is no reason for Alice to spend Sybil's outputs because doing so would incur more fee's than the spend is worth - hence the locktime expires and the funds become Sybil's.
And yes batching has everything to do with it. Let me rephrase it: Sybil has *many* groups of 2n nodes, each group is connected to *one* Alice. At each step she adds to the batches one fraudulent close transaction *from each different Alice.* By coordinating this she saves money on tx fee's in a way which *each individual Alice* cannot.
Imagine a super expensive court where you can present a fraudulent claim against hundreds of poor people at once. Each individual poor person cannot afford to present a counter claim for such a petty crime and without central planning they cannot come together to create a batch counter claim.

I'm guessing you finally got the concept.
"You really overestimate the benefit batching gives (hint: itll be below 50&amp; "
Completely wrong, I have no idea where you got this from. [
Even at 50&amp; the attack still works.

" channel closes because the batched version was not signed by the Alices" 
Very true but it doesn't change anything. 
"And before that, the Alices can spend all funds from the fraudulent channel closes.". You still don't get it: what incentive does Alice have to do this before the locktime if she loses money?
Consider the following: 1000 hash locked contracts all with 0.01 bitcoin waiting to be spent but the tx fee's are 0.1. Now consider 1000 Alice's all with a single preimage  and consider 1 sybil with the preimage to all of them. Sybil's ability to batch spend the hash locked contracts means she can profit from claiming, whereas each Alice alone cannot.
