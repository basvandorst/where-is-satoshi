Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure predates BCH by quite a bit. It began, as I understand it, as a place where some people who disagreed with some of the changes being made to BTC began discussions.

I own Bitcoin. I want to keep it. I bought it on an exchange. I want to move it to a wallet. But I don't want to pay the egregious fees necessary to do that. Not cool. :(
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:32:20
Well, weren't a couple dozen alts pumped in the past few days, with no/little news?
Isn't being added to Coinbase big news?
I'm not sure I buy this.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:41:20
Oh, I am better off now. I simplified the situation just to illustrate my point -- I bought the BTC by selling an altcoin that had done well. So I *am* better off. I just don't really feel great keeping it on an exchange, but I guess I'll wait for a little while and hope that fees go down fairly soon. Slightly risky, but I think I'll be fine.
It's just quite annoying though. For transferring to a wallet I don't have the possibility of going through ETH or LTC, unlike for instance transferring between exchanges.

I haven't seen any (ok, much... or let's say more-than-normal amounts of) FUD this time. The "dumps" (it's not a huge percent, really) feel rather organic too.
Either there's an "attack" that has been better-disguised than before, or I'm not sure if I buy it.

There's a lot in the media, your right, but I would say this thread is more referencing social media, including/especially reddit. Comments about high fees and long confirmation times, etc. IMO this is normal discussion and not really FUD.
A few weeks/months ago we saw lots of posts and comments about the impending chain death spiral, which felt pretty melodramatic to me.

Tell me more about this math where 0.1 * 8800 &gt; 900.

LBRY is still in beta I believe. You get free tokens for trying it out, watching featured videos. And they're up 10% today. :)
PM for referral, I think we both get 5 free LBRY tokens or something.

4 I think. But only once a day or so. It's not going to make you rich... unless it moons.
@_date: 2018-06-13 03:04:27
Sounds great. I'll be in Istanbul next week, looking forward to stop by.
Edit: Hmm, your fees aren't exactly reasonable though...

I mean, this is exactly the sort of comment that makes me dislike this subreddit.
Again, I'm not an expert, but increasing the block size makes sense to me: there are obviously a lot of transactions that need to go through, so if you have space for more then they can go through faster. I suppose the only main downside I see is that blockchain would grow in size faster, requiring more storage. But personally it seems like an increase at the moment (even if temporary) would be helpful.
Your comment did absolutely nothing to convince me that BTC's decisions are better than BCH's and moreover reinforces the idea that *this* sub is propagandistic. You haven't backed up any of your claims with a shred of evidence.
And for the record, I'm *not* saying "BCH is better than BTC". I'm asking for someone to explain to me why they think that's not true. If something I believe is wrong I'll happily admit it.
With evidence or logic. No with thinly veiled threats and empty statements.

Can confirm, the same exact thing happened to me.

I really hate that I am scared to post here. I am not a "shill," although I've been holding more BCH than BTC for a couple weeks.
I used to think that BCH was a ripoff coin and had no point. I sold the bit that I had after the fork. A couple weeks ago I started looking into it a little more and it made much more sense than I expected.
In the short-term, BCH seems... well, *better* to me. Especially since the 2x fork was cancelled. In the long-term? I have no idea. I'm not an expert. But I know that the pending transactions and high fees are a problem that BTC has and BCH doesn't, right now.
I would love to be able to read a discussion that shows the pros and cons of Segwit, big blocks, Lightning Network, BTC, and BCH in a rational and polite manner. It saddens me that this is so hard to find. From my research and experience on this sub it simply does not exist at all (I guess because posts are deleted?). On the other, you can talk about the issues and debates, but it's not rational/polite/logical.
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:23:34
I can send pics of my upvoted/downvoted history... although I don't know how well that functions as proof.
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:25:45
Where can I find the IP report?
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:36:25


Thanks for the civil comment. This is the part that I'm most interested in. I'll admit I don't understand Lightning Network very well at this point... but it's also over a year a way I believe I heard? Could you explain it to me or point me towards a good resource for learning about it?
In your opinion what's the advantage of the smaller block size meanwhile?
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:26:02
Also can upload a pic of the email I received from reddit if that helps

The current transaction fees make me sad because I want to use bitcoin but I can't this way.
Last month I spent some time talking about Bitcoin and crypto in general with a friend of mine from another country. We were traveling together, and it turned out by the time we parted he owed me some money (we had been alternating paying for things, I guess I paid a little more often). Not much -- less than $100 IIRC.
I told him not to worry about it, and since he we planning on buying some BTC anyway, he could just send it to me. It was a perfect solution, especially with the normal price of international bank transfers. 
A month later, he's not bought some BTC and he writes to me saying, "Wow, you didn't tell me bitcoin was so expensive to use..." He sent me the money he owed me, but paid between 10 and 20% of the total in fees. What a crappy first bitcoin transaction for him. :(

Hey, thanks a lot for this.
The "frog in water" analogy and idea that it would reduce incentives to develop better solutions both make sense. Wouldn't say I'm necessarily convinced 100% that they're true, but they're valid arguments.
The transaction fees and slow confirmation time have me really down, though. As a business owner who would like to accept Bitcoin, it's impossible for me to do right now, and that kind of sucks. So I think you could say there's danger in letting things continue in this vein for too long (in terms of adoption)... while, at the same time like you say, there's a danger in using the easiest if not best solution (even if the plan is for it to be temporary).
Interesting, again thanks for taking the time to type all that out.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:56:51
Yeah, I wish he had written to me *before* sending the transaction (I'd given him my address before) -- I would have mentioned how there are other coins that provide a better alternative at the moment. Oh well. Next time!
