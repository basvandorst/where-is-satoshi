you say it will be 36% of all the assets to cover the losses from the hack. 
I would understand that, if it was spread among BTC users/holders. 
However, since u included now everyone, at what price you calculated that 36%? 
At what price you are 'rebuying' BTC and you came to the conclusion that 36% haircut is needed?
From which Bitcoin exchange you will rebuy btc to put them back to the accounts?

Mt gox know all his users with names and address (LOT of it. Licences, notaries, apostilles, etc). Just find the users that  stole btc with transaction malleability and press charges OR give all names and address in public and we know what to do with them
