It doesn't have to be bcash. It could be litecoin, vertcoin or even digibyte ��

Don't be a Fuddy duddy! $ Buy Bitcoin $

You've got a point there ��. How about multiple pairs of fiat/litecoin, litecoin/ALT, fiat to digibyte etc etc. This would split the load.

And coin market cap ��

I think what he's trying to say is, it's not all about bitcoin. In fact bitcoin is slow, expensive and just shit compared to others on the market now. Which I agree :-)

Bitcoin is the real Shitcoin. The sooner this thing is gone the better. I just hope it goes gracefully without killing the market.

The hag has reared its ugly head again. Oh dear :-(

I will buy a few bitcoin and I'm sure thousands of others will. Therefore it won't reach under 10 ��.

We absolutely must get alts independent from bitcoin with more crypto trading pairs. I would even go as far as to say don't make any alts buyable with btc. Completely remove the pair. I think the market is unfit for purpose the way it is only getting killed by bitcoin instead of helped. Once atomic swaps happen that will do a bit to help it but whilst ever we can buy anything with btc, the market will do nothing whatsoever. I believe its dead in terms of price.

Does this mean that the prices on coin market cap are over inflated. If you are not in Korea and sell your cryptocurrency, is the price you get accurate to coin market cap or do you get far less?

The thing is... The solution is easy imo. We just need more damn trading pairs. That's it ��

This was exactly the reason I voted Labour. I'm not a fan of corbyn but I felt a bit uneasy about her Internet censorship vibe. Although, if she's concerned about innovation and fraudsters I don't think we are looking at a ban. It will most likely be an enforcement of KYC with other countries. KYC is not too bad for cryptocurrency tbh. I bet is that 0.1% of people who invest in crypto are doing so for nefarious purposes. The other 99.9% just either care about the tech or want to make a better financial future for themselves.

Is it me, or is bitcoin just dead :-(
