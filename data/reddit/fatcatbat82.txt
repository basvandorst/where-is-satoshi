An optimistic estimate would be about 200 kWh of electrical energy per transaction.
Network hash rate = 20 Ehash/s, energy efficiency = 0.1 J / Ghash, 230000 transactions per day.

Every normal person has a bank account, why don't you? Is it because you did a bit of unlicensed money transmitting or darknet drug trading and the bank shut you down?

Unfounded beliefs like this one are comedy gold futures.

The offender is anyone who keeps telling people that bitcoin will go to the moon and is guaranteed to make you rich. I.e. most people in this sub for example. The victim is anyone who believes them and buys their bitcoins.

It's been 9 years already and the merchant adoption of bitcoin is actually in decline, why should the next 2 years prove to be different?
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:50:24
How are the last 10 or so years so very different from the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s or 00s?

What kind of magical thinking is this?
@_date: 2018-03-08 00:40:42
No it doesn't.

This is a lie. Only proportionality matters.

There is no such thing as riskless saving.

Of course it's not going to grow forever, but that does not mean it'll stabilize.

Bitcoin has comparable crises several times a year.

Who's "we"? I'm pretty sure you haven't done nothing of the sort yourself.

Here's what'll happen: Nobody gives a damn about your paranoid delusions about evil governments. Eventually all the people you mentioned above will get normal bank accounts. Practically none of them will ever even consider using buttcoins. The few unfortunate ones who are suckered into the bitcoin pyramid scheme will be economically wrecked the next time it crashes.

It's not like there's something magical about euros, anybody can copy the technology that enables SEPA and thus beat bitcoin in every area.

Instead I'm sure they'll rush to a very safe and domestic bitcoin, never mind that FUD about it being run by Chinese mining cartels and used mostly to buy drugs and launder money for organized crime.
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:12:01
Are you sure you understand what the numbers you quoted mean? Why should they result in "the whole house of cards coming crashing down"? Why would the fallback medium be bitcoin instead of euro, renminbi, yen, IMF special drawing rights etc?
@_date: 2018-02-28 11:20:54
How is it possible that nobody in seems to understand the basic concept of proportionality?
Which percentage of the USD cash economy is illegal? What about the BTC economy?

The best way to help the unbanked is to get them bank accounts, not to con them into buying useless buttcoins.
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:14:59
So what do these warning signs point to? What should one realize here?
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:45:48
It's because they're stupid and pointless, and most reps notice this and vote against them.

Stop deflecting and answer the question.
Why did wannacry ask for btc, not mailed usd?
@_date: 2018-03-02 12:17:19
Except for Satoshi of course but he deserves every penny for inventing cryptography.
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:46:16
Well, yes. SEPA transactions namely. Faster and cheaper than bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-07 13:16:07
Sorry, bitcoin most definitely is a scam and the biggest players should all be imprisoned.

In reality there will be no audit, FED will continue exactly as before.
