Up until the recent price spike it's been pretty stable and gradually increasing.

Well why did you buy it in the first place? I'm assuming you believe enough in Bitcoin's long term viability that you think it'll worth more in the future, correct? If that's the case, nothing about Bitcoin has changed, it's still chugging along despite some companies/exchanges being weeded out of the system.
That said, the common mantra of "don't invest more than you can afford to lose" still holds true - will losing this money should the price drop further have a significant negative impact on your life, like not being able to pay the rent type of situation? If that's the case, you're in too deep, just keep your play money in, because that's what it is.

This is a very interesting development and cool that you can have a digital game asset be valued so much but I could also see this becoming problematic in the enjoyability of the game, as it becomes more of a pay to play system, or "buy your way to the top" system rather than one based on skill.
This reminds me of the [Curse of the Black Lotus Planet Money episode]( which describes a very similar problem with the Magic the Gathering game.
If a digital game asset becomes too valuable, does that now become a detriment to the very game that spawned it?
Also, as a side note, I'd like to make a quick plug for for those interested in this type of stuff :)

Agreed, which is why I used the word "until" to describe it. As for the so called Monero pumpers, they aren't even anywhere on the same level as the eth spammers from awhile back, and if you read their sub you'd realize they actually make it a point not to promote their coin so as to focus on code first rather than marketing pumps. It's only because of this recent spike that some people have started conversations about it outside their sub and they naturally jumped in to correct any misconceptions like when people wrongly refer to it as darkcoin for example.
Also I'll try to address the following question in your other comment, however I'm not a Monero expert:


Dash previously called Darkcoin was the one that had a substantial instamine and is one of the main criticisms against. Monero had no premine or instamine, in fact, one of the reasons Monero was launched is due to an unfair premine in it's predecessor Bytecoin, thus it was cloned and Monero was born with a much more fair distribution upon launch, now remains as the more actively developed cryptonote coin.
As for why Monero is better, the lack of premine/instamine discussed is one, the other is that it offers privacy/anonymity on the protocol level through the cryptonote cryptography as opposed to Dash's darksend which requires a second tier masternode which itself requires trusting the node owners. Thus monero's privacy is baked right into the protocol.

Maybe I'm a stupid head but you give the reason for avoiding Bitcoin because you want to avoid volatility and fluctuating values yet you are offering a coin which will fluctuate in value, probably more so than Bitcoin, not only that but you need to have 'growth potential' in the coin in order to attract ICO investors, otherwise what's the point of buying the coin... sorry but this doesn't make any sense to me, perhaps I'll read up on it some more when I have some free time.

Very good explanation and this type of documentation on how to use a wallet and what everything is, is often neglected with most wallet companies, so much so that users are forced to come to Reddit and other forums with very basic questions on how to use those wallets.

Unless you have specialized hardware and very cheap or free electricity then it will likely not be profitable. You'd be better off just buying bitcoin outright and waiting for the price to appreciate over time.
That said, if you're still interested in pursuing this, I'd recommend doing some reading of especially the sidebar info and perhaps do a search for "bitcoin mining calculator" to further determine if it'd work for you.

Hi I'm new to bitcoin and am wondering if you random people on the Internet who I have no reason to trust think that the price will go up to $650 soon so that I can put my life savings into it... also if you think the price will go down, please tell me so that I can buy in cheaper because I'm pretty sure that trying to time the short term market swings is the best approach to ~~gambling~~ investing, especially since Bitcoin appears to be so predictive and stable :)
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:56:09

Yes that is one of the more problematic issues he supports but to be fair he's [stated that he is skeptical of it but supports it as a mostly free trade agreement]( (which would be good if that's what it actually is) but of course not many people even know what is in it.

Coinbase.com allows you to sell and send funds to PayPal address so that's a good option. You could also try Localbitcoins.com or Paxful.com which will give you a higher premium but it's a bit more complicated and you have to be careful of scammers.

Yea I'm still not sure that really explained anything other than that you're basically creating a more complicated ad network in which you can say uses 'blockchain' technology where it's probably not needed but simply for the sake of attracting investors.

There are two types of purchases via Circle, by bank transfer or by credit/debit card. You can choose to setup either one or both. Buying via bank transfer will be cheaper as paying with credit/debit card will incur fees.

The price is determined by the market, and while you may be seeing a 'standard' price plastered all over the place, that price is likely from one of the big exchanges, or a composite of various exchange prices in which their is higher liquidity. That said, smaller markets, or exchanges which aren't as efficient, like LocalBitcoins.com for example, will have different buy/sell prices since liquidity and/or efficiency is lower.

Markets don't ever go in one direction forever, they tend to go up and down, so it's just traders doing their trading thang.
Other than that, some might speculate that some of the sell off is due to people spending Bitcoin on Steam which then get converted to fiat which would obviously have a downward pressure, but not so sure about that, probably not enough volume to be a primary effect but who knows.

You earn Bitcoin the same way you earn any other currency, by exchanging your labor, goods, or services for it. Bitcoin is an entrepreneurial space and the people who will earn it legitimately will be the ones who can offer value to people. 
Figure out something that people want, then sell it for both fiat and Bitcoin but offer a discount for payments made in Bitcoin.

When you use a credit or debit card you are by default giving up your identity to use it, so your question doesn't really make much sense unless you are asking about using a prepaid card, and in that case there are no services that will take a prepaid since it would violate AML and KYC laws. 
If you're trying to stay anonymous, you'll have to stick with cash based buying services:

Mining in general is difficult to make a profit on unless you have specialized equipment, knowledge, and cheap electricity; and cloud mining operations are typically a scam, and even if they're not, you are taking a considerable risk in that investment hoping for a return which are in no ways guaranteed.
Your best investment in the crypto space would be to just buy Bitcoin outright and make sure it is secure and backed up and under your control, then hopefully wait as the price appreciates over time.

I like the idea, but I'm skeptical that this will give us the 'best content', rather I think it will indeed incentivize low quality content like memes, clickbait, circle jerking, and misleading information - basically I fear it'll be a lot like Reddit except even more perverse because of the money incentive.
What I'd like to see is a system that rewards truth, fact checking, and accurate reporting/information; one that would have checks and balances put in. I don't know how that'd work but it'd be a step in the right direction.

Coinbase only allows a certain amount to be purchased instantly depending on your level of verification. While you've locked in a purchase price for whatever amount of Bitcoin you bought, you won't get access to it right away until your ACH bank transfer is cleared. The reason they do this is to cut down on the amount of fraud, since bank transfers can be reversed/cancelled and Bitcoin transfers are permanent, so they need to do that in order not to get screwed.
That said, Coinbase is pretty legit and you will get your coins you bought deposited to your wallet once the bank transfer clears which usually takes a few days.
@_date: 2016-04-22 15:30:45
You'll waste more money on electricity and your valuable time doing this then what you'd make in Bitcoin, if anything, as you can only really mine with specialized equipment. If you want to make money from Bitcoin, you'd have much better chances of just buying it outright and waiting for the price to appreciate over time.

Both are good wallets, but I've been personally using Airbitz for the past year as my everyday mobile wallet. It's a good wallet for both usability and security, along with some other great features like the built in directory, fold app, buy/sell function, and two factor authentication. 
Mycelium is good too, but I've seen a lot of people on here lose funds because they either broke or lost their device and didn't backup the wallet by writing down the 12 word seed. Airbitz is easier to backup since you only need the username and password, but regardless of whatever wallet you use, make sure you BACK IT UP!

Wow, yea obvious scam, I have to wonder what made you trust this site? Just a quick glance demonstrates a 'too good to be true' sentiment along with the complete lack of evidence to suggest it's run by legitimate people.

@_date: 2016-04-22 21:23:21

I don't know about the Bitmaker one, but I have the three apps from [Bitcoin Aliens]( on my phone and they've been pretty reliable about sending whatever I earn each week.
Basically you're earning fractions of a cent for viewing advertisements. You won't make a lot and it's not worth busting your ass over but it's not too bad for killing time while waiting around for something. And it'd be good if you just want a small amount to mess around with. 
That said, your time is probably worth a lot more than the payout you'd get from faucets like these and in the end would be better off either earning Bitcoin or just buying it outright.

The issue with those countries you pointed out is that while they certainly have high levels of social welfare programs that is not the same as being socialist. All those countries have very strong market based economies which helps to fund their social welfare programs. In fact some of those countries get offended if you refer to them as socialist, a good [example being Denmark]( which by the way doesn't even have a minimum wage.
I also wouldn't say those countries have high levels of government ownership of services, other than things like healthcare and education, they're not taking over large swaths of the means of production like Venezuela for example.

When you create an account at Kraken it'll automatically create a wallet to temporarily store any Bitcoins you purchase until which time you transfer them to your own personal wallet, then you can send them to and from the gambling sites you want.
I'd recommend setting up a personal wallet first and try transfering a small amount to it to get the hang of it, here's a few suggestions:
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)
* [Breadwallet]( (iPhone)
* [Mycelium]( (Android)
* [Copay]( (all devices)
* [Electrum]( (Desktop)
Just make sure you follow the appropriate backup procedures for whatever wallet you choose.

I'd also like to point out that while I constantly see posts here about losing funds from people who forgot to backup their 12 word seed in Mycelium, I have yet to see any posts on people losing funds in AirBitz. It seems like Airbitz is taking the right approach for making a wallet that is idiot proof while protecting user privacy/security.

While Bitcoin's fate is yet to be determined, it is interesting that some people are willing to be as bold to pronounce that a certain technology is "dead", not just Bitcoin, but we've seen this throughout history and those same people simply fade away into that obscure section of the history books which demonstrate their shortsightedness and mostly forgotten.

Mining actually has thinner margins than you might think, so it's in their interest to process higher fee transactions over lower fee transactions. In addition, it doesn't help bitcoin to have a flat transaction fee since there is limited block space and charging a flat fee (price controls) means misuse of a limited resource, aka tragedy of the commons and likely make the back log of transactions WORSE not better. Please do yourself a favor and read a basic economics book.

ChangeTip would be the most convenient but you need a credit/debit and if you don't want to use a bank account or ID then that option might be out. LibertyX would be great for $20 without providing an ID so that'd work. Localbitcoins and Mycelium Local Trader is the best anonymous option but kind of a pain to use for a mere $20. A bitcoin ATM would work great, but it depends on the ATM as some of them do require a form of ID and whether or not you are located near one.

This is such a poor argument for physical gold - try buying your groceries with pieces of gold the next time you lose power and see what happens. And if the grid goes down in a more apocalyptic scenario then gold is still useless as we'll have much bigger problems to deal with than figuring out trade with tiny slivers of metal; more likely food, clean water, and bullets will be the currency of choice.
The fact is we live in the 21st century where the Internet and global worldwide electronic commerce exists, and Bitcoin blows gold away in the current world.

You're not an idiot, but you're certainly ignorant about what it takes to mine Bitcoin, and to be perfectly blunt - you don't have it - you'd be lucky to mine a few cents with your mac after a year of burning through electricity and time, it's just not worth it. Don't sweat it, it's a common question.
If you wanted to follow through with mining for whatever reasons, I'd start with sidebar material on lots of good info there. That said, you'd be far better off earning Bitcoin in other ways. Keep in mind that Bitcoin is money, so if you have something of value to offer, exchange it for Bitcoin while offering a discount.

Bullshit, Bitcoin's future has never been brighter, there's so much new amazing tech being developed right now it'll be hard for alts to catch up.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:26:26
The Bitcoin protocol itself is agnostic, it doesn't care about ideology, it just runs the code it's supposed to.
What I suspect you are really asking about is how the Bitcoin *community* is different than religion, and yes you could say there are some similarities as there are most certainly people who have fallen into a cult like mindset, but that could be said about all the other crypto communities; or any other project/idea in the world that has passionate followers. 
However, the main difference is that one can validate the bitcoin code for themselves where as they can not validate the claims made by religion.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:31:25
It's similar to either running your own full node to validate transactions or trusting someone else's node. The nice thing is if you want to validate your own transactions you can, or if you don't mind outsourcing to a third party you can do that too.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:01:45
The Ledger generates receiving addresses just like any other wallet, so you'd just send the coins to one of those.
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:53:22
Technically yes, you get an equal amount of coins from whatever new fork there is if you control the private keys, although it can be a pain in the ass to claim those new coins and of course in order to get any money for them someone needs to be willing to buy them.
Since December there's been dozens of forks but are mostly useless since no wallet or exchanges support them.

There's no specific date, it's a gradual rollout process. We've already seen main net transactions and there is already one vendor accepting main net lightning transactions right now. Over time we'll see more and more adoption with vendors, wallets, exchanges, and users.

You make a good point, but I think you are wrong that the serious people are sitting on their hands, they just don't hang out here as much or their posts get drowned out by the garbage; or they're either busy coding or doing something else more productive, so you are less likely to notice them.

It makes sense, any sufficiently popular blockchain is going to have issues with fees and transaction speeds, not to mention people aren't simply using Bitcoin or any crypto to buy everyday stuff since they're mostly in it as an investment or speculation.
That said, they seem some what open minded on their outlook of potentially adopting Lightning Network in the future, among other cryptos, although it seems like they're probably waiting for a clear 'payments' winner before investing resources into support.

There's nothing stopping the governments from still paying for and doing all that stuff, they'd just use bitcoin instead of whatever fiat currency they had.

By that reasoning, Dogecoin should have been the dominant coin several years ago, but crypto isn't just about transaction fees and time; if you think that then you're completely missing the point of Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies in general, it's about censorship resistant money and Bitcoin still leads in that regard. In addition, Bitcoin still has a lot of development going on that will continue to increase this aspect of the coin along with privacy features, and even making transactions faster via Lightning Network. There's so many things in the pipeline that I don't see how you wouldn't think Bitcoin price will increase substantially more over the years.
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:42:11

Bitcoin has roots in libertarian and anarcho-capitalist ideas as a money not controlled by any government or central bank and thus those that support that philosophy believe Bitcoin to be better money than Fiat and advocate gaining more of it. Not to mention that Bitcoin has shown to increase in purchasing power over time, but whether that remains true in the future, we will see...

The Segwit2x fork was abandoned back in November and really unrelated to current Segwit adoption.

Again, what the heck are you talking about, the Bitcoin Classic client is dead last time I checked, unless you're talking about BitcoinCash/BitcoinABC? If that's the case one just needs to look at the dev repos to see that there's way more activity in Bitcoin Core client and that's not even including the dev activity for the three different LN implementations... and that's in addition to all the other cool dev work going into things like Zerolink, MAST, Drivechains, etc. If you think there's no development going on in Bitcoin then you don't know dick about Bitcoin.

These are all very basic economics questions that apply to pretty much any market from stocks, bonds, gold, silver, art, houses, comic books, bitcoin, etc etc...

I haven't used Mycelium in awhile but it hasn't been a good wallet for some time now and no doubt its fee estimation algorithm is wayyy off. That said, I believe it does let you pick different priority transactions with different fee levels, and in this case, since you're only sending a payment to yourself you could have chose the low priority or low fee level since I assume time is not issue in this particular transaction.
Also, today the mempool has been clearing out frequently and I've had multiple transactions go through for only 2 sats per byte or just a few cents and got confirmed in 1-2 blocks, so something definitely was screwy with your wallet.

My previous comment wasn't meant to be smug, so I apologize if you thought that, just simply pointing out where the updates were. 
People interested in github repos of various node software tend to be on the technical side, so no doubt it'll lead to technical conversation. I think if you were looking for a layman interpretation of what the upgrades mean, then be sure to ask that; some non-smug people will likely answer - they do exist :)

Lol, well you obviously didn't learn much about mining if you think it's first come first serve, miners can pick and choose from the mempool whatever transactions they want to build a block.

This type of shit happens all the time, it goes up quick and it comes down quick, however, over the long-term, over the course of years, the trend is going up - by A LOT!
My recommendation is don't panic over the short-term volatility. Make a commitment to hodl for the long-term and just sit back and enjoy the ride, otherwise you'll do something stupid trying to time the market and end up getting rekt.

I'm not sure it's accurate to call LN transaction 'off chain' since final settlement happens on-chain, I'd describe LN more as running on top of the chain. That said, LN is decentralized and users are the ones who maintain it, kind of like the Bitcoin main net.

There's two kinds of segwit addresses. Bech32 is referred to as native segwit, the ones that start with 'bc'. These offer the most space saving but aren't always compatible to send/receive to/from legacy addresses.
The other type of segwit is a P2SH nested SegWit which is kind of a hack between legacy addresses and native segwit that start with a '3'. These are backward compatible with legacy addresses but offer less savings than native segwit.

People would still need to spend it on basic necessities and eventually on stuff that improves their lives, after all that's the whole point of money, to eventually use it at some point in the future.
It would certainly make people think about their purchases more carefully no doubt, and in my opinion that's a good thing. Having a culture of savings and sustainability is far better than one of waste and rampant consumerism.

If you're trying to be private then the new mixed coins can't be associated with old wallet addresses. 
So you'd make sure they go to a new address in your wallet which most wallets will do, but also make sure when a new transaction is created the wallet doesn't include an old input that could potentially be connect to your old trail of transactions. To be on the safe side, i'd just send all mixed coins to a brand new wallet that hasn't been associated with any exchanges or other services that collect kyc info.
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:21:46
First of all, rule  is don't invest more than you can afford to lose. If this $1k is just 'fuck-it' money then yeah, I'd say it's a good speculation, especially if you plan on hodling it for 5 years. That said, we honestly don't know what the price is going to do, but a lot of people here believe in Bitcoin's long term potential as not just a money but a technology, so it's up to you to do your own research and figure out if it's right for you.

Yes, people will be able to profit from it, but it's not limited to one company, in fact it's more likely that the miners will benefit more than Blockstream since they're in a better position to run LN nodes alongside their miners.

Ugh, gettin sick of this fear mongering. First of all, Bitcoin miners don't emit carbon dioxide, they just use energy like any other computer regardless of source. And there has been some research that approximately 75% of Bitcoin's energy usage comes from green energy.
In addition, logically it makes sense that Bitcoin is actually a subsidy for green energy production since Bitcoin mining can be mobilize to move to cheap energy sources, mostly hydro plants where much of the unused energy would otherwise be wasted.

People will have to use it eventually, after all that's the whole point of money, to store value for use at some time in the future. People still need to eat, need to pay for utilities, need to pay for housing, and presumably would be still willing to pay for basic comforts, new tech, and entertainment; otherwise what's the point in life. Personally I think the whole deflation concerns is way overblown; we already see this in tech, things like mobile phones get cheaper and better every year but people still buy the latest products even though we know they'll be cheaper six months from now.

Bitcoin's main selling point is decentralized censorship resistant value transfer - other coins sacrifice this to various extents in favor of things like faster transaction times, more throughput, or other complex features.
If you're ok with more centralized coins then by all means use them if you want, but people who back Bitcoin are banking on a  decentralized censorship resistant store of value with a reliable and predictable monetary policy.

How do you know that address belongs to the person selling the software? You do realize that anyone can lookup any public address, correct? In fact, just a quick glance at the activity for that address demonstrates the same type of transaction activity that an exchange would... thus, it's likely the scammer just grabbed an address from an exchange and used that as "proof" for his sham video.

The fee actually looks pretty low, especially with the huge backlog in the mempool. You haven't lost anything, if it doesn't go through it'll just go back into the wallet you sent it from. It's possible you could push it through faster with a higher transaction fee if it's urgent.

Hey man, it's awesome that you're curious about this tech and wanting to fiddle around with it but as others have mentioned, mining Bitcoin right now is both difficult and expensive; and can not be done on any regular spare computer anymore since they would not be able to compete with the current line of ASICs, specialized mining hardware.
That said, if you're interested in learning more about Bitcoin tech and wanting to get in on the ground floor of the latest tech, then I'd recommend using those spare machines to setup and experiment with running Lightning Network nodes. While doing this right now may not earn much money, it could potentially earn a lot for you down the road, not just from running LN nodes but from the additional skill set you'll have from messing around with this stuff.

Bringing this up is like beating a dead horse. The community debated this ad nauseam for years now and I suspect that you really aren't interested in an honest discussion about scaling, but rather simply just being provocative; perhaps trying to purposely get banned so you can go back to and wave your badge of honor by shouting "hurrr durrr censorship".... 
Fact of the matter is, we've already split with one group choosing to scale with bigger blocks and one group choosing to scale with second layers; this is actually GOOD since people can choose which chain they prefer and use that one; not much else left to talk about. The market will decide in the end which was the better approach.

I don't understand why so many people have this all or nothing mentality. How about this, sell off half so you recoup your initial investment and then let the rest ride? This way you won't have lost any money in the event of a crash and still have upside potential with the amount you're hodling.

Segwit transactions are only cheaper when sending FROM a segwit address.

There isn't really a "finished" state for Lightning Network, it's intended be constantly growing and evolving similar to the Internet itself. 
In regards to how much TPS (transactions per second) it can do depends on all sorts of factors like liquidity of the channels and how well interconnected it is, but theoretically it is certainly capable of doing volumes similar to major credit cards like the VISA network, if not exponentially more than that.

Another fork did happen, BTC hodlers also received Bitcoin Gold, did you check to see if you have that? One of the benefits of investing in BTC is that there are going to be even more fork coins in the future that you can cash in on and they're all based off of the true Bitcoin, BTC.

Anyone can view the source code of Bitcoin and see that it is limited to 21 million coins, doesn't matter if it's forked, those aren't bitcoin, they're different networks.

Keep in mind that there aren't even that many people transacting on LN yet so of course you won't see much activity, especially if you're not well connected. There's still a lot of work to do for LN and even for node operators it's going to be a technical deep dive for figuring out the best way to optimize them for routing transactions.
My advice, keep fiddling and learning about LN, perhaps even work on making a LN app. It will likely be a useful and highly valuable skillset in the future, the same way the blockchain devs are highly valued and sought after currently.

You could probably do 100-150 sat/byte and have it confirm in several hours. Also since you're putting it back into storage, it might be a good idea to put it into a Segwit address so that the next time you need to use it the fees will be cheaper.

Since LN required Segwit, development didn't really begin until about a year ago and has only really picked up momentum in the last 3-6 months. Quite frankly, the fact that so much dev activity has come into the LN space in such a short amount of time is pretty incredible.

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:33:59
Because each exchange is it's own marketplace where people are buying and selling Bitcoin so the price across exchanges is going to vary depending on the buy/sell activity at those exchanges. As for CoinDesk, I believe they use some type of average index price that factors in the price of many of the big exchanges that would include the South Korea ones which are buying A LOT more than the other exchanges which is why the big difference, but eventually people will arbitrage and the other exchanges will catch up.

Lightning is an overlay network built on top of the existing Bitcoin blockchain protocol. Similar to how the Internet is built in layers, Lightning creates an entirely new layer, offering instant, high-volume payments that are denominated in the blockchain’s native currency.


Yes, it's less secure since the funds are online and connected to the network, so there's a similar risk as regular Bitcoin hot wallets. That said, it's not expected for people to store large amounts of bitcoin in their LN wallets since they'll mainly be used for spending. 
Think of LN wallet like a checking account and your hardware/cold storage wallet as your savings account.


There's actual working software right now and a continually growing LN main-net. With it's ability to do instant, practically free, and true micro-transactions, I'd say it has a hell of a lot of potential utility and purpose.


It is possible to earn transaction fees by running a LN node, however the process is a bit tehnical right now and requires funding of highly connected channels to even see anything, even then the amount earned is still negligible at this point in time.
That said, if you're interested in dabbling in the technical aspects of running an LN node, I'd recommend the following tutorial:

Localbitcoin has it's own wallet but you'd eventually want to transfer them to your own wallet that you control. That said, Localbitcoin is in no way a cheap way to buy bitcoin, for that you'd want to go through an exchange like GDAX, Gemini, Bitstamp, or Kraken.

If you're only here to get rich quick then you gonna get rekt, Bitcoin is a long term play. And rather than focusing on the price start getting into the actual technology, learn how it works, do some coding, make a website, etc; it's much more enjoyable and rewarding in that regard even during times of turbulence.

It's still the early stages of Bitcoin adoption so you won't see  a lot of Bitcoin companies hiring for traditional job types simply due to the fact that there aren't that many yet.

As someone who regularly watches the price and reads the daily threads I can say that in the short term there is no telling what the Bitcoin price is going to do. However, in the long term I believe the price trend will continue to increase over time simply due to increasing infrastructure build out, increasing transactions, increasing user base, increasing venture funding, and decreasing number of Bitcoins being created (block halving in July'16) - all those make me think the price will be much much higher in the future.
That said, trying to time short term tops and bottoms is a fools errand and will just make you an emotional wreck. I believe the best strategy is to simply set aside an amount each week or month and buy, essentially dollar cost averaging.
Also, if you believe in the future success of Bitcoin then the price will most certainly be significantly higher, so no, I don't think buying now is too late even if the price does remain volatile and dips down in the short term.

* [Any Bitcoin ATM]( for cash

I don't understand how you lost the seed to your electrum wallet? Did you delete the wallet or wipe your hard drive? Also, what do you mean when you say you have the "transaction password"?
Regardless, unless you properly backed up your Electrum wallet like you are supposed to, either by writing down the pass phrases or saving a copy of the wallet.dat file then you probably won't recover the funds.
On a side note, if you are not even capable of securing Bitcoins yourself, I would highly discourage you from giving it to others as a present.

First off there's a difference between censorship and moderation. It's important that subs be moderated, aka have a set of rules for posting, otherwise things get way out of control with spam and general garbage. I'd personally even go far to say that there is not enough moderation in r/bitcoin. Your belief that the simple upvote/downvote governance system of Reddit is enough to keep things orderly is quite naive; you only need to peruse the many subs of this site to see examples of this not working without good moderation.
Most of the r/btc users who have gotten banned or had posts deleted here were not because they're being censored but because they made posts that did not follow sub rules or had posts with little substance containing mostly ad hominen attacks.
That said, if you have an actual issue you want to address, feel free to do so and I'm sure we can have a civilized conversation on the matter. Otherwise posting here simply to cry about perceived 'censorship' is just beating a dead horse and playing into the r/btc narrative.

The general consensus here is that unless you have the technical expertise and a cheap source of electricity then Bitcoin mining will not be worth it. Since you are asking about it then you will likely find it not a worthwhile activity, unless you want to do it for learning purposes.

Since you are asking the question to a Bitcoin centric sub then most people will give their opinion that Bitcoin is better, but understand that you are likely getting a biased answer. If you asked they would say Litecoin is better, if you asked they would say Dogecoin is better. The best thing to do is continue doing your own research and determine the question for yourself.

I took the survey but just want to point out a few things I noticed:
First, the questions seem like you are trying to target a random audience, but you realize by posting this to you will get answers that are biased/favorable to Bitcoin?
Second, one question asks whether the person thinks they have to pay taxes on Bitcoin's value but keep in mind that this is different in different countries.
Third, just to nitpick, regarding your demographic question on religion, you list agnostic and atheist as separate even though these are not mutually exclusive concepts, perhaps a better category would simply be "non-religious."

Most of the world's 7 billion people probably don't even know what bitcoin is let alone own 1 BTC and since there can't be more than 15 million people who own at least one then I'd say that counts as rare.

How do you plan to redistribute Satoshi's coins to the various options you mention above without access to the private keys? 
One of the whole points of Bitcoin is financial sovereignty, not having people be able to steal your money out from under you and redistribute it in way they supposedly think is best. And any of the suggestions you mention above completely undermine the whole concept behind Bitcoin. Those coins belong to Satoshi, which is well deserved, and we'll just have to wait to see what happens to them if anything.

I think if you're just into Bitcoin to make a quick buck trying to time the market then you might as well just sell now and take your profit. That said, if you actually believe that Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology and will succeed in the future then you shouldn't even need to sell back into fiat since Bitcoin will be a strong currency of its own, in which case you should hold it for the longer term and watch its value continue to rise over time.

You could try [WeSellCrypto.com]( but you'll pay a premium on the price and you can only buy a small amount without verification.
Other than that you won't find anyone stupid enough to sell Bitcoin for a reversible payment method to someone without any ID verification. Your best bet if you want to remain anonymous is to use cash and one of the following:
* [LibertyX]( for cash

Most of the core devs do not get paid by the folks who run Bitcoin.org (The Bitcoin Foundation), they either get paid by other organizations or work on the code themselves, so if the Bitcoin Foundation disappeared those devs would presumably continue to work on it, not to mention there is nothing stopping other developers from joining in and working on the code, it is open source after all.

Bitcoin is still in the early adopter phase and thus there probably aren't or weren't that many people that needed tracking software since it's not used for everyday expenses... yet. Though certainly if this thing does catch on, which is looking more and more likely then I'd imagine there'd be a need for all sorts of financial programs.
I'd likely use one if it's good and met whatever needs I had. Currently, I use an excel spreadsheet to calculate my Bitcoin cost basis and gains/losses, so that might even be good place to start for a basic app.

Though I agree we should go back to showing the vote numbers, I'm not sure this solves it in this particular case since this scam had a lot of sock puppet accounts in it all upvoting comments to promote the scam and downvoting comments [like mine]( stating it was a scam.

Welcome to Bitcoin. It's possible to make a profit by buying low and selling high just like any commodity, stock, or currency; of course the trick is knowing when it's low and when it's high which is a lot more difficult than it sounds. This is not the only goal of people who use Bitcoin, some of us believe that it is a better currency than fiat currencies and offers more freedom and financial sovereignty than the alternative government backed currencies.

It's a bit of a vague question and the answer is unknown. No one really knows where the price is going in the short term but based on increasing build out of the infrastructure, increasing number of transactions, increasing number of users, and increasing amounts of venture capital funding into Bitcoin related businesses; it seems the future of Bitcoin look pretty good and if that is the case then the price will need to be significantly higher if this thing catches on.
That said, buying $10 worth of Bitcoin isn't going to make or break you in the short term. If Bitcoin dies and goes to zero you only lost $10 bucks, no big deal, but [if it goes to $1 million some day]( then that's around $25,000... but of course this is all speculation, the point is don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

If you're only into Bitcoin to make a quick buck then you might as well sell now and take your profit. However, if you believe in Bitcoin's future as a long term currency/store of value then the price will have to be significantly higher than it is now, in which the advice would be to continue to hold. Not to mention if Bitcoin does become a successful currency then there will be no need to sell back into fiat since you would buy goods and services directly with your bits.
@_date: 2018-09-14 18:53:13
The point I'm trying to make is that by transferring the private keys, any analysis of the associated public addresses doesn't change, so when you eventually transfer it to a new wallet the same analysis tracking can still be done as if it were an initial transfer, it doesn't through the FBI off any bit less... honestly there are better ways of anonymizing coins.

The wait time is not the fault of Coinbase or Bitcoin, it's the archaic legacy banking system which takes several days for transactions to clear. If Coinbase gave you the Bitcoin instantly it'd be possible to cancel the transaction and thus screw them over. That said, they do allow for a certain amount of "instant" buy per week if you add a credit or debit card to your account.
If you really need Bitcoin same day then best to go with cash and use either [Localbitcoins.com]( [LibertyX]( or any [Bitcoin ATM](

As someone who regularly watches the price and reads the daily threads I can say that in the short term there is no telling what the Bitcoin price is going to do. However, in the long term I believe the price trend will continue to increase over time simply due to increasing infrastructure build out, increasing transactions, increasing user base, increasing venture funding, and decreasing number of Bitcoins being created (block halving in July'16) - all those make me think the price will be much much higher in the future.
That said, trying to time short term tops and bottoms is a fools errand and will just make you an emotional wreck. I believe the best strategy is to simply set aside an amount each week or month and buy, essentially dollar cost averaging.

Yes they both are wallets. The difference is that Circle is a web wallet that also has some other features such as the ability to buy Bitcoin or  USD and convert between the two easily. One negative aspect of Circle is that they keep control of your private keys thus making them more like a bank or Paypal.
Mycelium is a mobile wallet that gives you more control over your money and private keys so long as you take the appropriate steps to backup the wallet by writing down the 12 word seed phrase and keeping it safe. Mycelium is more like keeping cash in your wallet or purse.
The basic function of wallet is simply having the ability to store, send, and receive bitcoin, and beyond that there are a number of wallets that offer a range of different features depending on what your needs are.

I think it's more about uncertainty. If Bitcoin is going to be a currency then people need to have a feeling of dependability and confidence about it.

Many Libertarians and AnCaps (Anarcho-Capitalists) are into Bitcoin because it is a money that is not controlled by any government and helps to facilitate peer-to-peer free trade without the need of any violent central organizations. Thus if Bitcoin does take off and become a global currency, I could imagine governments become less and less powerful entities, perhaps even going away all together.

It's a revolutionary decentralized peer to peer currency that is not controlled by any bank or government, that alone is enough for some people around here to believe that Bitcoin will be worth considerably more than it is today. 
In addition, we've also seen increasing infrastructure being built, increasing number of transactions, increasing number of users, increasing number of vendors accepting Bitcoin, increasing amounts of venture capital funding to Bitcoin companies, block reward halving in July 2016, etc. These along with many other indicators are good reason to believe that the price of Bitcoin in USD will be much higher in the future.

That is a good point, but it is also on the individual to do due diligence on these things, especially when dealing with Bitcoin. The website itself looked pretty sketchy, there was no information on who is running the thing, and it is making an offer well above most other exchanges.
The old "buyer beware" and "if it seems to good to be true it probably is" phrases come to mind.

The ledger is stored on every node on the network. When your wallet syncs with the blockchain/network, it's catching up with all the transactions stored in the ledger so that it comes into consensus with the others.

Well technically you are not spending BTC directly, Coinbase and VISA acts as a middle man where Coinbase sells your Bitcoin on their exchange and then transmits the money over the VISA credit card network... not very direct. If it was direct, you'd send your bits from your wallet to the vendor's wallet without the need of a third party banking service as Bitcoin was meant to be.

Yea man, the trick here, as you've discovered is to employ your skepticism BEFORE you send your bitcoin, this is especially true in an industry in which we know there are an abundance of scammers.
Losing $1300 sucks, but fortunately it's not a life changing amount, I hope, and should be considered tuition for learning to be more skeptical when someone offers you something too good to be true.


By the way, in what world is $1300 in btc a small amount? This should have been an immediate red flag, like if you really needed to verify an address, why not send $1 or less worth... :?
@_date: 2018-09-01 16:19:06


Again with the false equivalency. Yes of course guns are cheaper, they're completely different product with completely different material/labor/production costs. This is like complaining about the cost of a house because a laptop is cheaper... it's a silly argument to make.


Both the education and healthcare industries are ones in which the government is heavily involved and subsidizes a great deal. Perhaps if the govt were less involved and these industries actually had to be competitive then they'd be less costly.


I disagree. In fact I believe it's the opposite, where government interference allows those industries to price gouge and keep prices higher.

Here is a link that explains in detail what segwit does and why it is beneficial:
The TLDR is that it basically reduces the amount of data needed to be transmitted for a transaction and thus result in much lower fee for those using segwit transactions. And since Coinbase is responsible for a large number of network transactions then their adoption of it should help the network as a whole in regards to more throughput and lower fees.

Yes, I own two Trezors (the older model) and love them. I believe they're probably the best and most secure hardware wallet choice you can get.


The hardware wallet connects to your computer or laptop and a wallet is setup that is viewable from a browser, from there it's like any other wallet that generates a address/QR code which you can send your Bitcoin to from your phone wallet.
I'd recommend taking a look through the Trezor user manual to get a better understanding of how it works:

Well I guess it depends on the service and if it's of value to anyone, but I don't think it's too late to start a Bitcoin company, probably still early enough to have an advantage.
The thing is, if you already have competitors in the space then you'll either need to create a better product/service, a cheaper product/service, or a niche product/service that fills a need.

Now Coinbase and other big exchanges does both and Gemini is still dragging their feet.

This was my thinking too. A deflationary currency helps to put a stop to mindless consumerism and helps to usher in an age of sustainability. Economists like to talk about "Growth" all the time, but eventually we are gonna run out of resources and our focus should be on sustainability.

If your transactions are taking 7 days then you are wayyy under paying the transaction fees. I use bitcoin on a fairly regular basis and I've never waited longer than a few hours max but usually within 10-30 minutes.
Edit: Apparently OP is confused and talking about the 5-10 business day ACH transfers from his bank to Coinbase which has nothing to do with the Bitcoin network, this is a legacy banking system issue NOT a bitcoin transaction issue.

We can't tell you what to do with your money, you should figure that out for yourself.

Well first of all, the ETF isn't even approved yet and it's still unclear if it will. 
Second, if it does get approved then there will likely be a speculative rush pushing the price much higher which means you'll likely pay more for buying via the ETF and miss out on all the gains had you just bought bitcoin outright. 
Third, the whole point of Bitcoin is to take control of your money without the need of a bank or some other counterparty, so in my opinion buying the ETF kind of defeats this principle, if that's something you care about.

A lot of Bitcoin analysts have predicted between $2,000 to $3,000 by the end of the year and I'm pretty much in agreement that that seems like a likely price target by end of 2017. Long-term, over 5-10 years, there is a lot higher potential but it's hard to say how high, really depends on all kinds of factors, and of course it's still risky and could crash as well.
Just remember the general advice - don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

Yes, buy from Coinbase or wherever then transfer to your own wallet, that's what I do anyways. I mean, the whole point of bitcoin is to control your own funds without the need of a third party so it doesn't make sense to me to leave those funds with Coinbase which is essentially a bitcoin bank.
@_date: 2017-02-26 17:50:46
There seems to be some misunderstanding in your post. Firstly, it isn't really Core vs. Viabtc. Viabtc is just one mining pool that hasn't contributed to the development of any software clients and has chosen to run an alternative client to Core which is Bitcoin Unlimited. The debate is really about whether to hard fork or not, and many believe that hard forking could cause problems or even be dangerous. It's not really as simple as saying 'Let's just do both' otherwise it'd be don't by now.
@_date: 2017-02-23 21:40:33
Yes, I believe it could be one as a soft fork, but even that might not be necessary since Lightening Network would allow for fractions of a satoshi to be transacted.

I'd recommend [Airbitz]( it's a good user friendly wallet with good security and they use a zero knowledge encryption system, so you control the keys of the wallet and Airbitz doesn't know any anything about you or the wallet.

@_date: 2017-02-12 18:05:00
I'd recommend starting off by getting a wallet first and messing around with it by sending and receiving a small amount of bitcoins so you get a hang of actually using it.
I personally use and recommend Airbitz wallet but all of the following wallets are good for noobs, have good usability, and secure:
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)
* [Breadwallet]( (iphone or Android)
* [Mycelium]( (Android)
* [Bitpay wallet]( (all devices)
* [Jaxx]( (all devices)
* [Electrum]( (Desktop)
If you download one of the above wallets and PM me your receiving address, I'll send you a small amount to play around with :)
After that, you can buy Bitcoin from exchanges like Coinbase.com or Gemini.com, or Localbitcoins is good if you want to retain anonymity but you'll pay a higher price.
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:58:55
You're in that same mindset we all had when first thinking about buying bitcoin - you keep putting it off while thinking the best time to buy, but the problem is you can't predict the price and end up regretting not buying lower or buying too high just before a big dip... we've all been through this.
The best strategy is to not give a shit about timing the market and just dollar cost average into it. Put aside a set amount of play money each paycheck and buy bitcoin with that over the long term.
@_date: 2017-02-13 21:47:00
Most exchanges where you can buy bitcoin you can also sell bitcoin. Here's a few options:
* [Gemini](
* [Kraken](
* [Bitstamp](
* [Bitfinex](

* [Localbitcoins.com](
* [Paxful.com](
* [Bitsquare](

@_date: 2017-02-21 18:10:30
The reason it's taking so long is due to the legacy banking system where it can take 5-10 business days to settle an ACH transfer. Since Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, Coinbase needs to cover it's ass and wait for the ACH to settle before releasing the coins, otherwise they would get scammed out of money all the time.
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:26:26
Not necessarily, but if most people have the same mindset of buying more bitcoin than there are people wanting to sell bitcoin, then yes the price will go up more.

I think an easy way to figure this out is to imagine what would happen if you lost your bitcoin investment, would your life be completely derailed or would you carry along just fine... if the answer is that it'd fuck your life up if you lost it, then you're probably over-invested.

You can read more on what an ETF is here:
The Winklevoss' Bitcoin ETF is simply an ETF made up of Bitcoins, similar to that of the [Gold ETF (GLD)]( So for example, you could trade it on a traditional stock exchange or even buy it for your retirement account without actually dealing with getting a bitcoin wallet and securing it yourself - which has it's benefits and drawbacks.
If it gets approved then that means another big avenue for funds to flow into bitcoin via security exchanges and thus potentially/probably push the price up much much higher.
[Here's a decent video]( that explains the potential of the bitcoin ETF approval as compared to the Gold ETF approval from some time ago.
And [here's a decent article]( from a respectable research company, Needham, which explains the potential outcome if the approval happens.

The alts were stagnating most of the time bitcoin was on it's bull run for the last few months, I assume because people didn't want to miss out on any gains. Now that BTC is settling down a bit and moving sideways it could just mean that traders are back to trading the alts, but I think Bitcoin is considered the reserve currency of cryptoland so most of that money will flow back eventually once the alts finish their respective pumps.

In your research, did you get the impression that Bitcoin will be successful over the long term, because if it is then the price will have to be significantly higher than it is today. So I think if you believe in it's long term prospects and are willing to hold on without panicking during short term price volatility then it could be a good move. It also makes sense, as others mentioned, to simply dollar cost average into it - buy a fixed amount on a regular basis. 
Of course, the general rule around here is don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

Well there's a delay with however long it takes for the ACH bank transfer to settle, but some like Gemini will let you buy before the bank transfer completes but you won't be able to transfer the coins until it settles.

Use a wallet in which you control the keys to and no one can close your 'account' as opposed to a third party like Coinbase or Xapo. I'd recommend any of the following:

* [Mycelium]( (Android)
* [Bitpay wallet]( (all devices)

I hang out in the new section a lot and try to pay attention and help with newb posts about getting into Bitcoin. From my observations, there are three main reasons why newbs get interested in Bitcoin:
* Investment/speculation/trading
* Drugs/fake IDs/dark markets
* Gaming - mostly related to CS:GO, opskins.com, etc.
While the first item is mostly applicable to the settlement layer, the other two deal with a consumer/merchant payment application. So while there probably aren't a lot of people using Bitcoin to buy coffee, it does seem to make sense for some use cases as payment network over the Internet. Although, I will say, I do personally use Foldapp in my Airbitz wallet to buy and get discounted Starbucks on a fairly regular basis.

You earn bitcoin the same way you earn any other money, trade your labor or goods for it. Of course, getting paid in bitcoin for work takes a little more effort and entrepreneurial spirit, but it could just be a matter of doing what you already do but offer your customers a discount if they pay you in bitcoin.

Try the [Jaxx]( wallet.
You can buy bitcoin from the following:
* [Coinbase]( bank transfers &amp; debitcard
* [Gemini]( bank transfers
* [Localbitcoins.com]( P2P
* [Paxful.com]( P2P
* [LibertyX]( cash
* [Any Bitcoin ATM]( cash
Once you get bitcoin in your wallet you can use [Shapeshift.io]( to exchange it for other altcoins if you want. Actually I think Jaxx has shapeshift built into it so that should make it pretty easy to convert.
@_date: 2017-02-01 18:19:33

It's not really worth it unless you have the technical knowledge, specialized equipment, and a cheap source of electricity. That said, if you're still interested, I'd check out the sidebar in - they have a bunch of useful information.
As far as cloud mining, from what I can tell, most if not all of them are scams and would not risk my money with them.
I think if you're interested in earning a profit in the Bitcoin space then the best and safest way to do that is to just buy Bitcoin outright and make sure that it is properly secured, then hopefully watch the price appreciate over time.

I have no idea what you mean by 'smart wallet', Gemini is a Bitcoin exchange that has a built-in wallet for sending/receiving.
Localbitcoins is a peer to peer exchange and people can sell for whatever price they want. The variation in price could be due to many factors like what forms payment they take or whatever, it's up to you to figure out who you want to buy from.

It depends on who you're dealing with. It tends to be more reliable for buyers since sellers are more at risk of fraud, but it's still a good idea to only deal with trusted sellers as indicated by those sites' respective reputation systems, and if you stick to that then you shouldn't have too many issues, especially with the built in escrow systems.
@_date: 2017-02-24 00:26:01
If you're trying to time the market then you're just going to drive yourself nuts with anxiety. If you believe in bitcoin for the long-term, just buy now or dollar cost average into over time, that's the better rational strategy. Otherwise, if you're just asking for short-term ~~trading~~ gambling then I have no sympathy for you.

All these scamcoin launches are eerily similar to how an IPO works in the finance world, the issuing bank gets their cut first and then the scraps go to the heard. The only difference is that an IPO is represented by shares of a real company and not some vaporware.

I actually don't know that much about mining, but from what I understand it's not a concern, since the network self-adjusts it's mining difficulty levels. Thus if it became less profitable to mine, then those miners would turn off their machines, but that would lead to a difficulty decrease in the hashing algorithm which would then make older/less powerful hardware more competitive in the mining game, and profitable for those machines. I think as long as bitcoin has value then someone will be willing to mine for it whether it's a warehouse full of high-end ASICs or some kid's 5 year old mac book.

I buy Bitcoin from Circle with just a credit card pretty easily, also with ChangeTip, and cash with LibertyX. I've also used a Bitcoin ATM and that was pretty easy... Yes there is some level of verification, but it's really not that much different than signing up for any other payment system.

If you're uncomfortable owning Bitcoin, I don't think moving into alts is going to ease any sort of anxiety, perhaps just increase it. If you have trouble sleeping owning crypto then move some of that back into fiat. 
If instead, you're saying you're uncomfortable with your current choice of risky speculation and feel the need to gamble even more then yea go into alts, but I doubt you'll get much advice in a Bitcoin centric sub.

Cloud mining is almost always a scam and when it's not a scam, it's not even worth the money. You'll make more money just taking whatever amount you were going to invest and buy some bitcoin outright and keep it safe and secure in a wallet you control.

Even though Circle has no fee for buying a do notice that their buy price tends to be higher than Coinbase so it probably evens out. Also, Circle does have fees if you're purchasing with credit or debit card.
And I wouldn't really say 1% for Coinbase is significant considering it's one of the lowest broker fees in the industry. Either way, I don't really see much difference in either service, I use both and they both work equally well for me at very reasonable cost.

You can read more on what an ETF is here:
The Winklevoss' Bitcoin ETF is simply an ETF made up of Bitcoins, similar to that of the [Gold ETF (GLD)]( So for example, you could trade it on a traditional stock exchange or even buy it for your retirement account without actually dealing with getting a bitcoin wallet and securing it yourself - which has it's benefits and drawbacks.
If it gets approved then that means another big avenue for funds to flow into bitcoin via security exchanges and thus potentially/probably push the price up much much higher.
[Here's a decent video]( that explains the potential of the bitcoin ETF approval as compared to the Gold ETF approval from some time ago.

The thing about Bitcoin is that it requires personal responsibility and due diligence to use it. Unless you can convince the scammer to send it back, it's gone for good. Hopefully you didn't lose too much in the process. Let it be a learning experience.

Pretty common occurrence for Bitcoin, just traders doing their trading thing, no reason for concern. It can't go up forever, we need some corrections here and there.

You can buy bitcoin at an exchange and is probably the easiest option, here's a few to choose from:
* [Gemini](
* [Kraken](
* [Bitstamp](
* [Bitfinex](
* [GDAX](
* [Coinbase](
To store your bitcoins you'll need a wallet, below are some good ones:
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)
* [Breadwallet]( (iphone or Android)
* [Mycelium]( (Android)
* [Bitpay wallet]( (all devices)
* [Electrum]( (Desktop)
* [Trezor]( (Hardware)
* [Ledger Nano S]( (Hardware)
Honestly, the best way to learn about bitcoin is to use it. If you install one of the wallets above and PM me your receiving address, I'll send you a small amount that you can play around with and practice sending/receiving bitcoin :)
@_date: 2015-01-07 21:46:37
Eh, it's really not that cumbersome, just takes a little leg work like most anyone responsible for picking a reliable service or product. You could say the same thing for Bitcoin, for example, you wouldn't just blindly pick any wallet service to store your coin, right? It takes being a responsible consumer to do your homework so you don't get screwed over and lose your Bitcoin... same thing for USD, Euro, whatever.

Welcome to Bitcoin. You can buy and sell Bitcoin at the following sites:
* [Coinbase.com]( for bank transfer
* [Circle.com]( for credit, debit, bank transfer
* [LocalBitcoins.com]( best option for anonymity
Or you could also use your Bitcoin to buy stuff with, here's just a few good spending options:
* [Purse.io]( - get 15% discount on Amazon
* [Fold app]( - 20% discounts at Starbucks
* [Newegg.com](
* [Spend it at local merchant](
As far as tips and tricks, I recommend the following FAQ and Bitcoin 101 video to get you started in understanding how it works:

Also, keep in mind all information given on the site is completely vague and there is zero info pointing to the details of the people behind this... not to mention there are hundreds of similarly looking clone sites as this one promising equally outlandish returns for little risk. Of course, this blatant of a scam should be obvious to anyone with a modicum of skepticism.

Trezor is certainly a good option if you want to store a large amount of Bitcoin, but if you're looking at smaller amounts then I'd recommend a mobile wallet that you control the private keys. Coinbase is fine for buying, but I wouldn't store my bitcoin with them.
Here's a list of some good wallets where you control the keys and offer a good mix of both usability and security:
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)
* [Breadwallet]( (iPhone)
* [Mycelium]( (Android)
* [Copay]( (all devices)
* [Electrum]( (Desktop)
Just make sure you follow the appropriate backup procedures for whatever wallet you choose.

I doubt Bitcoin ever will or could move to a proof of stake system, heck, we can't even agree to go from 1mb to 2mb blocks let alone completely changing it's validation system. The good news is that you can vote with your money, so if you think that another cryptocurrency is better then you can easily put your money into that coin.
@_date: 2016-03-04 05:23:58
Just to be clear, in case you didn't know, a Bitcoin is divisible by 8 decimal places or 100 million units, so if it becomes a mainstream currency then people will be using smaller units of a bitcoin, like a 'bit' or 'satoshi' for example, and if this is the case the price of a single Bitcoin will be in the millions and owning one whole bitcoin will indeed be rare. So to answer your question, it can be both used by everyone and be rare at the same time, sort of :)

What payment method are you trying to use?
If it's something like Paypal or similar then yes you will get a lot of sellers wanting ID since there is significant risk of fraud to sellers for certain payment methods and it's in their interest to protect themselves from losing money, otherwise they wouldn't sell.
I'd suggest looking at either a different payment method, like using cash in person for example or cash deposit at a bank, or perhaps try to find a [Bitcoin ATM]( that doesn't require ID.

Coinbase has probably helped Bitcoin get to where it is now more than any other company in the space. They've on boarded a tremendous amount of new users over the past few years. In addition, their business depends on Bitcoin being successful which is why it baffles me that people accuse them of wanting to hurt Bitcoin... I realize people disagree with how they think it should scale, but seriously can we start being a little more rational.

If block space scarcity is required for decentralization, then how is it determined what is the optimal scarcity limit (block size) for optimal decentralization? Surely you'll agree that 1mb block size is arbitrary? If decentralization is the primary motive of Bitcoin then why not lower the blocksize even further?

I've done a little tipping, certainly not as much as you, but one interesting thing I noticed is that some people will thank you for the tip and then still not collect it. 
I think the reason for that is there is still some confusion even though the tipbot message has a link to "how to collect" - I wonder if the tipbot message should also include a note mentioning that the tip expires after seven days, thus adding a "ticking clock" element.
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:46:56
Well yea they are shitty people, but what is more worrisome is how gullible the Bitcoin community is. In an industry that is not regulated, people need to be much more wary of claims being made by practicing the concept of skepticism, an idea that seems to get lost in these parts. The buttcoiners would not be as nearly effective if people stopped rewarding them for their deceptive behavior such as this post.
@_date: 2016-03-18 16:10:43
I was not aware of that, though still a little confused. Are you saying that I can put in 1BTC of a side-coin and it's possible that I'd get less than that when exiting back into Bitcoin? Also, you're saying I can't get more than that, so it still seems less efficient than a freely floating alt coin market, correct?.

I realize you're trying to make a case for Bitcoin usage here, but there are better checking/savings accounts out there that you can look into for practical USD usage. A good example is the Schwab Checking which has zero fees, zero minimums, reimburses you for all ATM fees incurred, and gives a small .10% interest on your checking balance.

They also said similar things about the Internet when it first came about, that it was interesting, but not really useful.
It could be that Bitcoin doesn't take off and is relegated to a niche of people with unrealistic expectations, who knows, but the technology behind it is pretty significant and is not going away even if Bitcoin does. That said, I wouldn't write off Bitcoin just yet, it takes time for technologies to mature the same way it did for PCs and the Internet.

Since faucet payouts are relatively small amounts, they will be processed with small fees which means they will likely take much longer to confirm, but they should eventually make it to your wallet.
Most wallets use HD (Higher Deterministic) structure which means they'll create a new receiving/public address for each transaction which helps with privacy, but all generated receiving addresses for a wallet will still work indefinitely so it's not something to be concerned about.
Regarding Coinbase, it's a good place to buy Bitcoin but I wouldn't use it as a main wallet - I'd check out some of the following which give you control of your private keys and offer a good mix of usability and security:
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)

I don't know, I think that's a pretty loose definition of an alt coin. In the case of Changetip, they are still dealing in Bitcoin except they are holding the private keys and keeping their own ledger of what Bitcoin they owe to each customer, that doesn't make it an alternative coin in my eyes.

Coinbase is in the business of selling people Bitcoin and have one of the lowest fees (1%) in the industry, why wouldn't they charge fees, do you expect them to provide this service for free? And yes, more users is good for Coinbase, and it's also good for Bitcoin, growing the number of people who use it is how Bitcoin succeeds.

So you want someone to provide an exchange service free of charge? You have to understand that when you are exchanging anything whether it be dollars for stocks, bonds, yuan, gold, or bitcoin, you are going to pay some kind of transaction fee. The companies who offer these services don't work for free and why should they?
Coinbase currently has a 1% transaction fee to buy Bitcoin which is one of the lowest in the industry so you're getting a good deal.
What you likely heard from the podcast was that Bitcoin has low fees within it's system, basically sending Bitcoin from one wallet to another, which is around 5 cents or so per transaction.
That said, here's a few bits to get you started :)

It's unlikely you'll get your coins back, it's not like credit cards, one of the main points of Bitcoin is that it is irreversible unless the person you send it to voluntarily sends it back. The thing with Bitcoin is that it requires personal responsibility and due diligence when using it. 
There are a lot of these Bitcoin "doubler" investment type scam sites out there which are basically the same thing, they promise some outlandish return like doubling your coins in 24 hours, you send them Bitcoin and they keep them. Remember, if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Did you really think you'd somehow get a 100% return on your money from some random site on the web?
Sorry to say but you'll have to write this one off. Hopefully you didn't lose much and can use this as a learning experience.

I know this has been brought up in the past numerous times, but why not create an incentive to a run a node by giving nodes a small share of the rewards/fees?

I suspect that the small block side is manipulating votes that put Coinbase in a bad light considering their support for scaling. I've noticed this in other threads that put Coinbase in a negative light, even ones with very little substance, that get wayyy more upvotes than the other threads.

What, are you kidding me? Just look at the infrastructure support alone and it is significantly more "evolved" then all the other alts combined. Bitcoin has way more software support in wallets, services, exchanges, atms, merchants, gaming, financial instruments, venture capital investment, and users.
Now look at the other alts, you'll be lucky to get a functioning GUI client let alone a single mobile wallet... and while Bitcoin is going through some growing pains it is still the most dominant and liquid, and there continues to be growth in the infrastructure.
I'm not hating on other coins, I think they're great, I love competition, but to say things like "Bitcoin is over" is exactly FUD regardless of where you stand on the scaling debate.

I don't think this browser will be doing an on chain transaction "per page" though, I suspect they'll have an off-chain system which simply moves ad-money between people's browser wallets and then once you hit some payout threshold you can then transfer on-chain to your own wallet. That said, if this thing takes off, it'd still ad a significant amount of transactions to the blocks.

Yes it's possible, you can send Bitcoins to any wallet you want, that's the great thing about it. That said, Electrum is a desktop wallet so it may be difficult to let the Bitcoin ATM know the address you want it sent to.

Using the main chain for everyday merchant transactions just isn't feasible for the long term no matter how big you make the blocks, sorry but it just isn't, unless you want the only nodes that exist to be a handful of giant data centers; and if that's the case then the properties of bitcoin that make it a decentralized censorship-resistant immutable ledger are kind of pointless, might as well just use a database at that point.

I'm not sure that I would even want to automatically send 5 cents per page. First of all, most pages I visit via links from Reddit for example are typically garbage blogspam articles, or something equally annoying that I usually immediately close out and rather not have them get one nickel from me. Second, even at 5 cents only, that will add up... think about how many pages you visit a day/week/month on the Internet, it's probably a lot more then you think and could likely add up to $100s per month. I don't think most people are willing to trade that much in exchange for no ads.
That said, this Brave browser where it shares Bitcoin ad revenue with the user might be the better approach since that still gets ad revenue to the publisher due to a small bribe going to the user in exchange for not using ad-blocking.

Some good places to buy are:
* [Coinbase.com]( for bank transfer
* [Circle.com]( for credit, debit, bank transfer
* [LibertyX]( for cash
* [LocalBitcoins.com]( best option for anonymity
* [Any Bitcoin ATM]( for cash
* Or [check here]( for more options worldwide.
I'd recommend trying out some of the following wallets which are user friendly, convenient, don't require a full download of the blockchain, and lets you control your private keys:
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)
* [Breadwallet]( (iPhone)
* [Mycelium]( (Android)
* [Copay]( (all devices)
Just make sure you follow the appropriate backup procedures for whatever wallet you choose.

There are probably some shills, trolls, etc, but there are some people who have a legitimate disagreement with the development direction in regards to scaling, but that said I don't think it's over, Bitcoin is still top dog and will likely be for quite awhile. 
There are people moving into other coins, and that's fine, people can and should vote with their money, that's what free markets are all about. That said, most all of the alts are pretty useless right now even if they might have more innovative features, but Bitcoin has a pretty vast infrastructure and investment in place so even people moving into alts will still rely on Bitcoins infrastructure to actually use their coins.

Could you elaborate on your concerns about the softfork safety? Also, what do you think is the false narrative being peddled and why?
@_date: 2016-01-27 17:42:35
Breadwallet is one of the more secure mobile wallets and I have yet to hear anyone getting their Bitcoins stolen from one. I think as long as you make sure you have the backup phrase in a safe place so you can recover it should the device fail, get damaged, or stolen then you should be good.
You do not need a data plan for it, you just need an Internet connection to actually use the wallet for sending/receiving Bitcoin which should work fine on a Wifi connection.
As another commentor mentioned, if you have a large amount of Bitcoin, then it might be worth looking into a hardware wallet like a Trezor or Ledger for example, but for the most part I think Breadwallet is safe.

Getting Segwit activated and enabling the use of second layer scaling like Lightening Network, Tumblebit, MAST, etc will create MASSIVE scaling way beyond anything that BU can provide - we're talking instant transactions, micropayments, beyond VISA levels of transactions so that Bitcoin can be usable and accessible by everyone in the world - that is a much much more appealing prospect than a modest on-chain scaling increase which will only set back all these amazing features by years. In addition, a contentious hard fork would have a huge negative effect on the price which would take many years to recover, if at all.

Maybe. Some think we could see a drop if the ETF gets declined and that might be a good time to buy, but then again if it gets approved then the price will likely go A LOT higher in which case you'd miss out on the gains...
Personally, I think think the best strategy is to just dollar cost average into it by buying small fixed amounts on a regular basis in order to smooth out your cost basis, rather than getting all kinds of anxiety from trying to time the market and constantly watching the price.

SegWit doesn't solve the fee problem initially, although it will relieve some pressure with a modest blocksize increase, but it puts us on track for MASSIVE scaling way beyond that of what BU has planned. Yes BU can give an automatic bump in onchain scaling but the transactions will still take ten minutes to confirm - second layer solutions like LN, Tumblebit, MAST, etc will give us instant transactions beyond VISA levels of scale so that the whole world can use Bitcoin... that to me seems much more appealing. 
Adopting BU means we do get a quick bump but then all the second layer stuff along with a malleability fix will get set back another few years at least.
And I do agree with you that if we split then the altcoins will get an advantage and I sometimes wonder if altcoin advocates sometimes participate in the promotion of BU as a divide and conquer strategy.

To be clear, while an exchange could fake the number of Bitcoins it holds, essentially operating a fractional reserve, it doesn't create/"print" any actual new Bitcoins - the number of real Bitcoin will always remain fixed. And in the case of an exchange behaving poorly like Mt. Gox for example, the customers who thought they held Bitcoin on the exchange will simple lose their funds - which is why it is important to hold your own coins in a wallet which you control the private keys and not entrust them to a third party.

@_date: 2017-02-21 18:06:28
Maybe ask in they'll be able to give you better and more information.
That said, getting into mining is tricky and difficult to be profitable. I'd suggest doing your own research, figure out the costs of the rig you're buying and plug all the numbers into a bitcoin mining calculator to see if it's worth your effort/money to mine versus simply buying bitcoin right now with that same amount of money.
My personal opinion is that by the time you buy the rig, get it setup, and then break-even; you'll have missed out on a lot of gains had you just used that money to buy bitcoin outright at the current price.
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:34:35

My understanding is that miners need to actively set a switch/signal for segwit in core, just running core doesn't automatically mean they're signaling, so I think you might be confused on that process.

If you wait to sell until the actual decision then you'll likely miss your opportunity; if you want to lock in the current price then you'd have to sell BEFORE the decision, assuming you believe that it's going to be denied.
That said, all you're doing here is gambling and trying to time the market which is a great way to lose money in my opinion. If you believe in Bitcoin long term then the price will have to be much higher than it is now, in which case just hold on to it. If you're just here to gamble on short term price swings then I don't really have much advice or sympathy for you.

Yes, this is it. If you look at these scam sites they usually offer several payment methods such as Paypal, Skrill, or even bank transfer, it doesn't matter because the web form you put the info in does nothing, it's just for looks to convince you to send Bitcoin to the QR code that pops up.

Because Bitcoin core is more stable and bug free, however they still want emergent consensus over segwit which is the reason for using this bitcoinEC patch. Like I said, there's no indication they support segwit, in fact using the EC patch would indicate the opposite.

I'm not sure where you are getting this impression that the debate is being stifled, it's discussed here ad nauseam every single day in multiple threads; and not just in but in on twitter, on YouTube, on blogs and Medium articles - the scaling debate is being presented everywhere!
It's up to users to sift through all this stuff and try to figure out what is true and what is the best path forward. Personally, I've been begrudgingly reading about this stuff for over three years now and I've come to the opinion that the Core devs have put out the best client software, have been the most meticulous in testing/reviewing the code, and have presented the best/safest path forward with Segwit, along with all the amazing other tech it enables such as Lightening Network, Tumblebit, Mimblewimble, MAST, Shnorr signatures, etc...

He believes he was wronged by that particular exchange and is pursuing legal action. It has nothing to do with his stance on Bitcoin as a whole.
Let me ask you this, if you know a particular exchange is engaging in wrong doing or even scamming people or won't release bitcoin you've stored with them and you point that out and shut it down, does it meant that you are Anti-Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-11 17:11:56
We've seen increasing infrastructure being built, increasing number of transactions, increasing number of users, increasing number of vendors accepting Bitcoin, increasing amounts of venture capital funding to Bitcoin companies, block reward halving in July 2016, etc. These along with many other indicators are good reason to believe that the price of Bitcoin in USD will be much higher in the future.
That said, it is still an experimental currency and we don't know what will happen but the trend is looking good so far and if you believe Bitcoin will be successful in 10 years time then the price will need to be significantly higher than it is now. The way I look at it is that the upside potential is far greater than the downside risk. Even if you just invest a small amount for 1 Bitcoin, the loss of $450 won't be a big deal but if successful then you're looking at perhaps $3,000; $30,000, $300,000; $1 million per coin...

You realize there are hundreds of these sites out there offering very similar 'too good to be true' investment returns that offer very little detailed information on how they can provide a 0.25% HOURLY rate, which comes out to a 2,190% annual rate of return, and offer zero information on who is running this thing? Not to mention if you look up the registration information it's to a generic c/o with a PO box address... come on man, either you are the lying thief running the site or you are incredibly gulilible.
Also, the way these ponzi scam sites work is that they run fine for the first several months and even do payouts on small amounts like your $5 dollars as a means to entice people to trust putting in larger amounts, they'll suddenly go offline and disappear with all the funds as these sites always do.

Unless you have specialized mining hardware and cheap or free electricity, then mining for Bitcoin is going to be waste of time and money for you. You'd be better off just buying Bitcoin outright and waiting for the price to appreciate.

He has brought up valid concerns worthy of discussion and not to mention that Coinbase has been one of the main on ramps for new Bitcoin users over the past several years, it's really discouraging to see this kind of childish behavior from either side of the debate.

This is a really good point to bring up, the BU team has NO plan at all for a hard fork - they have not indicated at all at which hasrate they'll fork nor how much lead time they'd give the community to switch clients - this leads me to believe that they're willing to hardfork on a moments notice without any warning AND without any preparation to switch would mean their chain's demise despite a majority hashpower.

Nah, there's a lot more to Bitcoin than that. It's by far the most secure chain with most hash power behind it, most tested and reliable, more devs working on it than any other chain, more services and wallet applications than any other coin, and most of all it's actually used by people for various things other than pure speculation like most altcoins.
In addition, there's actually tons of research and development on-going that are being worked on for Bitcoin such as various implementations of Lightening Network/payment channels, Tumblebit, Mimblewimble, MAST, Schnorr signatures, etc - these are all things which will improve Bitcoin's scalability, utility, and privacy features.
@_date: 2017-03-08 23:20:11
Indeed, if we want to scale to cover massive worldwide adoption with instant transactions at VISA levels where everyone can use it to buy their coffees then we will need to enable second layer scaling solutions like Lightening Network... which needs transaction maelibility fixed via Segwit... so lets hope that it isn't stalled and dragged through the mud for too much longer :-(
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:20:25
I don't see why we should, we all know there was good chance it wouldn't happen and unless you stupidly bought at the top then there's no reason to feel bad, and even then the fundamentals of bitcoin are still the same and long term prospects still good. The whole ETF thing was way over rated in my opinion anyways.

There's nothing stopping them other than there aren't really any places or ways to spend ethereum, and I find it hard to believe that the price run-up is because people are looking to use eth as a payment system, it's quite clear that people are getting into eth as a speculative play and not for any type of utility.

If it was a web wallet, then there's a possibility you received an email from it as verification or some such, maybe do a search of your email archives for 'bitcoin' or 'blockchain' or other related bitcoin words and see if anything comes up that will give you an indication of the wallet. Also, as someone else mentioned, maybe check to see old apps you've installed on your phone to see if one of them is a wallet. 
Good luck and hopefully you don't forget where you put your money in the future :)

That's not the impression I get from reading r/btc or anything from BU supporters, they tend to shit all over segwit and lightening.
I can't speak for the devs so don't know what the over 100 plus core devs would do in the event of a hardfork, they'd all have to figure that out for themselves, but if it were me, I probably would just quit considering how hostile the other side is - so much stupid unfounded conspiracy theories and personal attacks would make me not want to give a fucking shit, so why work for a bunch of assholes who don't appreciate any of the work you've done for the past eight years - fuck 'em.

Why would you believe the government to do anything ahead of schedule?

Well I think if there is a hardfork to BU then that is definitely going to set back progress on any other second layer stuff that you mention by maybe another few years I'd presume, and that's even assuming those devs working on all this neat stuff would even want to continue their work built off of the BU client.
On the other hand, if we did get Segwit activation, it seems like we'd start seeing LN and other implementations quite soon thereafter.

I just took a look over in r/btc and I couldn't find any welcome enthusiasm for the new version of core at all, in fact the front page is littered with personal attacks, conspiracy theories, and misinformation.

Easy, the economic majority will just not use it and thus it is the alternative coin despite having a majority hashrate for a short amount of time.

We don't know what the price is going to do. I think the point is that it may not go back below $1,000, it could but maybe not, so unless you can accurately predict the future, it seems like your plan may be flawed.
If you believe in Bitcoin's long term prospects the the price will have to be significantly higher than it is now so why risk the anxiety trying to time the market when you can just buy and hold over the long term.

Although I'm not sure how you can ever get consensus on something when you aren't allowed to discuss it, so seems kind of self defeating... that said, I still don't get how consensus is even determined, for example, what was the criteria for implementing segwit, did that have consensus, and if it did, to what degree?

Higher fees will be inevitable regardless of the client that gets adopted which is why second layer solutions are what is needed to bring fast instant Bitcoin payments on a vast scale to the whole world while retaining Bitcoin's properties as a decentralized censorship resistant money.
If the BU client is adopted then your concerns about large powerful corporations controlling bitcoin becomes even worse since it is handing over more power to the miners who are already very centralized.

Your question is a little confusing as you are equating Bitcoin buying services with storage wallets which are kind of different things. You shouldn't be storing your Bitcoins in the same place you buy them.
That said, here are some good places to buy from:
* [Coinbase.com]( for bank transfer
* [Circle.com]( for credit, debit, bank transfer
* [ChangeTip.com]( small amounts w/ credit/debit
* [LibertyX]( for cash
* [LocalBitcoins.com]( best option for anonymity
* [Any Bitcoin ATM]( for cash
As for good wallets, the following offer a good mix of usability and security, and allow you to control the private keys:
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)
* [Breadwallet]( (iPhone)
* [Mycelium]( (Android)
* [Copay]( (all devices)
* [Electrum]( (Desktop)
Just make sure you follow the appropriate backup procedures for whatever wallet you choose.
@_date: 2016-03-05 02:33:40
Coinbase wants to make money, they're a business after all, and their business is selling Bitcoin to people. The more Bitcoin users there are the more money they make, thus it makes sense that they'd want Bitcoin to grow and succeed, and they happen to believe scaling the blocksize helps with that vision.
There's no need for these illogical conspiracy theories, this is simple economics folks.

I've not used that type of Bitcoin ATM but it seems like it scans the QR code of the address you want the coins to be sent, so in order to get them directly from the ATM to the Electrum wallet you'd need a copy of the QR code from your Electrum wallet to scan which could be a bit cumbersome since Electrum is a desktop wallet. It's much easier with a mobile wallet, since you can just bring up the receiving QR code on your phone and scan it right there.

If you're trying to time the market then you're just going to drive yourself nuts with anxiety watching the price all the time. If you believe in bitcoin for the long-term, just buy now or dollar cost average into it over time, that's the better rational strategy. If Bitcoin is successful over the long-term, many years from now, then the price will have to be significantly higher than it is now. Otherwise, if you're just here for short-term trading/gambling then I have no advice for you.
Also, Bitcoin is still considered a risky and volatile asset so don't invest more than you can afford lose.

March 11th or probably March 13th is the deadline for the SEC to approve the Winklevoss ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). If it gets approved then there will likely be a rise in price as a result but if it declines the price will probably also go down a bit too. I can't tell the future and know what the decision is so I can't tell you what to do with your money, you'll have to decide for yourself when to invest.

The reason people tell you not to do cloud mining is that most sites that offer this are scams where you send them bitcoin and they keep up appearances that you're making money, but when you want to withdraw your bitcoin they don't send them back - it is quite a common scam and it is the same with HYIP (high yield investment program) sites that claim to give you high amounts of daily interest, all scams.
There might be some legit cloud mining sites but even those are bad if you actually work out the math on them, it usually ends up much less profitable than had you just held on to your bitcoins.
Trading is fine to do and can be profitable but it is difficult to learn and usually you lose a lot of money in the learning process. If you're interested in trading I would start checking and read the sidebar material and maybe ask them for suggestions on getting started.
My personal opinion is that just buying and holding on to bitcoins is the best way to invest in bitcoin. Not only do I retain control over the coins but I've seen 100s of percent in returns on my investment.
Good luck.

Coinbase is a good place to buy, here are a few others:
* [Circle.com]( for credit, debit, bank transfer
* [LibertyX]( for cash
* [BitQuick.co](
* [LocalBitcoins.com]( best option for anonymity
* [Any Bitcoin ATM]( for cash
Also, while these are good places to buy, you might want to look into a wallet where you control the keys such as:
* [Breadwallet]( (iPhone)
* [Mycelium]( (Android)
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)
* [Electrum]( (Desktop)
Just make sure you follow the appropriate backup procedures for whatever wallet you choose.

One idea I've thought about, is doing something like writing a short story or poem in which your seed words coordinate to certain locations within the story. So for example, each seed word is located in the 3rd word, second sentence of each paragraph... or whatever combo you like. Then keep the story in a cloud folder like dropbox along with a bunch of other stories, then all you'd need to remember is the file and the coordinate scheme.
The benefits of this would be that you don't rely on a physical piece of paper which could get lost or damaged while having access to it from anywhere with Internet but disguised that anyone hacking your cloud account probably wouldn't recognize it.

Yes there have been concerns of censorship on but even if that is the case, it's not relevant to which client software is the best scaling approach. 
The moderators of are not core developers and the core developers are not moderators, these are two separate groups of people.

You earn bitcoin the same way you earn any other money, trade your labor or goods for it. Of course, getting paid in bitcoin for work takes a little more effort and entrepreneurial spirit, but it could just be a matter of doing what you already do but offer your customers a discount if they pay you in bitcoin.

Paxful is a peer to peer exchange that is mainly for buying/selling bitcoin and not to be used as a main wallet for your other transactions. Once you buy from Paxful, you'd want to send it to your own wallet, then from there you can send to wherever you want. I recommend any of the following:
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)
* [Breadwallet]( (iphone or Android)
* [Mycelium]( (Android)

No problem, although I should point out that you may not want to use Coinbase as a wallet, it's fine for short term and they're good for buying, but eventually you'll want a wallet where you are in control of the keys, otherwise they're no different than a bank.
Here's a list of some good wallets to check out:
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)

They can still operate a fractional reserve as long as people don't withdraw more than they have in their reserve, the same way that it was possible using gold. We've already seen this happen with Mt. Gox exchange where they owed more bitcoin than they had on hand.
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:44:03
We don't really know when a good time to buy is since short term price swings are quite unpredictable, however, many people here believe in Bitcoin's long-term success where the price would be significantly higher than it is today. So, if you believe in Bitcoin's prospects long-term, over many years from now, then go ahead and buy and hold on to it. If you're just here to gamble on short term price movements then I don't have much advice for you.
Also, be aware that Bitcoin is still experimental and volatile, so don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

Well yea, inflation kind of helps you out if you're in debt, that's true, but I think it'd be preferable that those people were encouraged to save rather than take on debt.

Yes, it'd work and Coinbase is legit safe way to buy but you won't be anonymous and it's against their terms of service to use bitcoin bought from them for illegal purposes so the risk is up to you depending on what you use them for.

It sounds like the issue is more with the legacy banking system as it can sometimes take 5-10 business days for an ACH bank transfer to clear, so I don't think waiting a week for a deposit to clear is really that unusual. I'd suggest maybe just calming down and wait for it to clear - many of my deposits have taken 7 business days to go through to Coinbase which really isn't a big deal as long as I get my coins at the price I paid for them.

Core team has been ready with SegWit rollout since November and the client for it is already being used by more than 50% of nodes, all that is needed is for the miners to signal for it and it to activate. Since the Core client is backwards compatible (a soft fork), their implementation doesn't cause a split.
The Bitcoin Unlimited client is the one that would cause a split since their software would hard fork the chain and cause much more problems which is why many people advocate for the soft fork (Core) scaling approach.

Nice to see both Gemini and BitGo rolling out native Segwit, great news for adoption and hopefully more exchanges, services, and wallets on the way. 
I doubt we'll ever see Bitpay or Blockchain support it, but that's their problem as they'll continue to fall out of relevancy as Bitcoin companies.
Also, if I'm not mistaken, I believe Bitstamp uses BitGo's API so that could mean they'll soon support native segwit as well, although I'm just speculating here.

That's not the *minimum fee*, [according to 21]( the current median fee is around 500 bits or about $0.60, which means you could probably still send with a smaller fee of 10-20 cents if you don't mind waiting - I can't imagine that this is an urgent transaction, just set a low fee and send it.

I think this is actually backwards. The assumption is that inflation helps to re-distribute wealth from the the rich but I think that's wrong; the wealthy elite easily avoid this problem by putting their wealth into other assets like stocks, real estate, investments, etc... they certainly don't store their wealth in cash sitting in a bank account, that'd be very stupid of them.
Inflation hurts the poor and middle class the most since they're most likely to keep their savings/emergency funds in cash bank accounts where they're subject to inflation while having less access to the kinds of assets that the very wealthy do to escape that inflation.
A deflationary currency would benefit the poor and middleclass by providing a stable store of value for their savings while also creating cheaper goods and services for them.

Assuming you mean wallets in which you control the private keys, then here are a few good ones:
* [Breadwallet]( (iPhone)

Just make sure you follow the appropriate backup procedures for whatever wallet you choose.

Something I considered as well, it potential gives the government access to a very large amount of bitcoins if needed along with the ability to regulate and tax those funds - it's pretty antithetical to the bitcoin ethos.
On the other hand, the more entrenched Bitcoin is with wallstreet and the financial sector, the less likely the government is to outright ban it or try to fight it.
It has it's pros and cons and I've been pretty mixed on the issue.

No you can't buy bitcoin from a bank directly. Perhaps your friend is talking about a p2p exchange like [Paxful]( or [Localbitcoins]( in which you deposit money into someone else's account and they give you bitcoin.
The easiest way to buy bitcoin is through one of the big exchanges but those require giving identity and compliance information and based on your profile history I'm assuming you're looking for anonymity in which you should check out the two P2P exchanges I mentioned above.

The impression I get from r/btc /BU folks is a lot of hostility towards any other scaling solutions especially from anyone from the Core dev team... so that excludes segwit, LN, Tumblebit, MAST, shnorr signitures, etc etc... to be honest, I don't see much innovation from the BU crowd outside of FlexTrans which is pretty much vaporware at the moment.

This is a tactic that really bad journalists use a lot in order to imply an allegation without actually doing so. It's a fallacy in that you are implying "Guilty until proven innocent" on said party when really any claims made  of wrong doing are on the onus of the person making the claim to provide the evidence.

The halving is when the supply of new bitcoin being generated gets cut in half. Currently when a miner mines a block, they get 12.5 bitcoin as a reward, this gets cut in half to 6.25 btc in May 2020. Basically this happens every four years. It started with 50 btc reward, then 25, 12.5, 6.25, etc.

Even doing that is not a good way to avoid risk since many scam wallets and services will work with small amounts, gaining your trust, then stealing when you finally send a larger amount.
The way to start is simply by using a wallet in which you control the private keys and not some custodial wallet, especially a web wallet on the dark net.

What wallet are you using?
Not exactly sure what you're asking, but it sounds like you are using an HD wallet which will generate a new receiving address each time which is a good thing, it helps with privacy. If that is the case, you don't have to worry about left over balances as your wallet should have control over all funds in addresses it has generated so if you send a bitcoin payment it will pull the necessary funds it needs from any address in the wallet.

Definitely a scam, I would stay far away. You know that old saying, "If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is." Well, offering a 5% daily return is absolutely too good to be true and there's no way they could deliver on that. 
This is a sign of a classic ponzi scam. They likely make payouts to early people who put in small test amounts in order to entice people to put in larger amounts, then once their pot is big enough, they shut down the site and walk away with all the Bitcoins.

No, no we don't. People have certainly spewed their opinions on this but I have yet to see any analysis or evidence that this would be the case.
In the grand scheme of world economics, bitcoin with it's tiny 10 billion market cap is practically nothing and is barely on the radar of most people. While there could be an effect on price, I doubt it would be because people from Britain or Europe will suddenly flock to bitcoin, but more likely current bitcoin enthusiasts speculating on that happening - similar to the Cyprus and Greek events of the past.

Sort of, the value that is created comes from the buyer of the currency. In the case of the pizza exchange, the person willing to exchange a pizza for bitcoin gave the bitcoin value. The person who gave away the bitcoin, while necessary in the transaction, valued the pizza more than the bitcoin and thus had a negligible effect on bitcoin's value.

It sounds like you are trying to buy bitcoin from a broker like Circle.com or Coinbase.com perhaps?
To be clear, bitcoin is not a company, it's a decentralized network for transferring value and the protocol itself is not taking or storing your ID information. That said, there are companies that buy and sell Bitcoin which may take your ID information in order to fulfill the various KYC and AML laws of whichever country you are in. Thus if you were worried about that then you wouldn't use those companies and instead get your bitcoin via a more anonymous way.

I would read the mining section of the Bitcoin.org FAQ, and since you're new to this, it'd help to probably read over the whole thing to get a better understanding of Bitcoin:

You're obviously not a believer in Bitcoin and just gambling at this point. If you need to ask a bunch of random people on the Internet for short term speculation advice then this is not the investment for you. Sell and walk away.
If you actually believe bitcoin will be successful in the future, years from now, then stop paying attention to the daily price swings, keep your bits safe and secure, and do something that's actually productive.

I think the use case would be more applicable to getting access to APIs. Thus the Machine to Machine payment concept.
Here's an example:
Websites like Netflix have a huge amount of extremely valuable data about it's service and various metrics of it's users watching habits. All this is very useful for other companies and those that want to make indepent web apps that use Netflix data like Instantwatcher.com for example.
The problem is a lot of companies like Netflix are closing down their public APIs because it's likely not worth the money and hassle of managing access to those APIs. However, what if you could simply pay 5000 satoshi per API request without having to go through the hassle of signing up for access... now you have web apps and other programs making payments to the Netflix API for data access, and the people who are curating valuable data that can be used by others can actually make some money.

Lol, not sure I would consider a week to be long term holding, it's a short enough time frame that the price could be lower. I was thinking long term as in years, which would likely see a significantly higher price than now. Regardless, they're your coins, do what you want - good luck :)

Most wallets today are HD (Higher Deterministic) wallets where a new receiving address is generated after each use. This is mostly to help with privacy and it's perfectly ok, you can still receive bitcoin to old addresses no problem. When you send bitcoin, you don't need to do anything additional, the wallet will figure out where to pull the funds from.

My apologies if my comment seemed abrasive but we've seen a lot of promotion of scams lately and just trying to do my part to warn people.
In your article/press release that your website published it promotes the ExeBTC.com saying the following:


These returns seem way too good to be true. In addition, I've seen very similar template to this site on other scam sites which makes me suspect. Also, there is very little information about who is running this "investment" service and how it's possible to deliver on those kinds of returns.
I'm curious if you and your website have properly vetted this company or do you have the habit of blindly publishing press releases? Would you personally vouch for this company?

AML = Anti-Money Laundering
KYC = Know Your Costumer
These are required by the US government of any company that acts as a money transmitter business. So if people want to get bitcoin in a more anonymous fashion they tend to have to go through peer to peer options.

I never understood this excuse, as I don't think I've ever observed or heard about situations where people are trying to push women out of tech, if anything they're usually clamoring to get them into it, but for whatever they just don't seem to be interested.
In addition, these days, tech or more specifically, programming is more accessible in all forms to pretty much anyone who is willing to learn, so I don't think I buy into this idea that there's some weird conspiracy to keep women out.

Usually a bank transfer via [Circle]( or [Coinbase]( will get you the best/closest to market price for bitcoin with 1% fee for Coinbase and 0 fee for Circle, although Circle's price/btc tends to be slightly higher from my observation.

It's not just Bitcoin, most journalists suck at getting things right for most everything they write about.

If minor swings like this get you emotional and cause anxiety then you should just sell now and walk away, it's not for you. If you think Bitcoin will be successful in the long term, then don't worry about it, sit back and enjoy the ride because it will almost certainly be a roller coaster for quite some time to come.
And to reiterate - don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

Here's a list of some good wallets where you control the keys:
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)
* [Breadwallet]( (iPhone)
* [Mycelium]( (Android)
* [Copay]( (all devices)
* [Electrum]( (Desktop)
* [Trezor]( (Hardware wallet)
Just make sure you follow the appropriate backup procedures for whatever wallet you choose.
Where to buy:
* [Coinbase.com]( for bank transfer and debit card
* [Kraken]( exchange
* [LocalBitcoins.com]( p2p trades
* [Mycelium Local Trader]( p2p trades
* [Bitsquare]( decentralized p2p trades
* [Any Bitcoin ATM]( for cash
We can't really tell you when a good time to buy is as it's largely speculative but if you believe in the long term success of bitcoin then the price will need to be significantly higher than it is now, thus now would be as good a time as any to buy. Also, don't invest more than you can afford lose.

Anyone who can predict this in the short term would be/is rich and sure as hell wouldn't tell everyone about it, and even if they did, are you just going to trust random people on the Internet?
That said, over the long term I believe the fundamentals are strong and it's headed up, so my personal opinion is to buy a little bit each week/month and wait it out over the long term, but what do I know, I'm just a random guy on the Internet :)

Are you accounting for the cost of electricity into your calculations?
In my opinion, though I'm not an expert on mining, but unless you have the necessary technical expertise and a source of cheap electricity, then mining is probably not worth it. You also need to take into account the opportunity cost of not buying Bitcoin directly. For most people, the better investment is to simply buy bitcoin outright and hold on to it.
However, if you're still interested in mining, I recommend checking out the sub as they're probably better suited to answer your questions.

There is already such a thing, the 'bit' denomination already is used to represent 100 sats, but it never really caught on.

There's no easy way to get bitcoin with a prepaid due to AML and KYC laws restricting most bitcoin brokers from accepting it. The only way to use a prepaid is via [Purse.io]( but you will pay a higher premium on the cost of the Bitcoin.

Advice to OP - all you need is regular wallet that you control and you can keep it in there as long as you want without any fees or third party messing with it. I recommend the following which should be fine for 1 BTC:
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)
* [Breadwallet]( (iPhone)
* [Mycelium]( (Android)
* [Copay]( (all devices)
* [Electrum]( (Desktop)
Just make sure you follow the appropriate backup procedures for whatever wallet you choose and keep it safe - this is important!

Couldn't agree more. While there certainly will be trolls, we also know that with the recent price rise there will be a lot of new people curious about Bitcoin who are trying to figure things out and if the first thing they're met with is hostility and an overall dickish tone then I could see many noobs driven away with a negative impression.

First I'd like to point out that just because Libertarians are ok with 'price-gouging' doesn't mean that they are against providing emergency services and helping our fellow human beings out, especially if it's provided by a private organization - a good example of this is the American Red Cross. Being in favor of free market principles doesn't mean you're also a cold heartless person that doesn't want to help people, quite the opposite in fact.
Second, the severity of a disaster doesn't negate the fundamental principles of economics (supply and demand), in fact in those situations it's much more pronounced and noticeable.
In your previous comment you mentioned bottled water which is a good example of why you should allow a free floating price on that product since it is something that can usually be found abundantly outside of the disaster zone and something that many motivated people can procure and deliver to the disaster area which means more clean water making it's way in.

1) Buy the $1000 worth of Bitcoin and send it to him. Explain that's the amount and cost at the time you received the cleared funds. Send him the receipt/confirmation documentation to back it up.
2) Never do that again. Let people be responsible for their own money otherwise you'll get blamed if something bad happens even if it's not your fault. I suspect your friendship with this person will be on the rocks after this.
Edit: you might just want to call him right now and explain the whole situation and ask him what he wants you to do, either go ahead and buy the coins at a potentially higher price, or send the $1000 back to him.
Edit2: I might be misreading your situation. Did you already buy the bitcoin on Coinbase? If so, you'll get them for whatever price you bought them at the time. Coinbase just needs to wait for the bank transfer to clear before they release the coins to you, so it's probably not a big deal and just a matter of waiting.

Sorry man, it definitely sucks, but take this as an expensive lesson in doing due diligence next time.

Digix isn't really any better, the gold is still stored in a centralized location controlled by a third party, so who gives a shit if you hold a "crypto token", that doesn't stop them from making off with the gold, or having it seized by a government, or operating a fractional reserve.

It doesn't exactly say in the article but I suspect wind power could be a big part of it, since that energy sector is growing a lot in Texas, and the firm running it already mines with renewables in Norway.


It must make sense economically to use wind power there for mining, given the [other big wind/mining project with investor Peter Theil](
You can't exactly turn wind off, so it makes sense to use that underutilized energy for mining, when it would otherwise go wasted.

I think Gold is on the way out as a store of value since Bitcoin has been able to combine the best parts of gold and the best parts of fiat to create a money with way more utility than gold will ever have. The only thing gold still has going for it, is its long history as a store of wealth.

It could be possible that the contractor is already well off and has enough fiat runway to cover expenses for the foreseeable future and is willing to risk taking bitcoin.
I'm an example of this. I do freelance work and keep around 6 months in fiat savings to cover my expenses, so that allows me to happily accept payment in bitcoin for those willing to do so since I have a long term time preference. And I even offer discounts to those that pay in BTC.

Perhaps people should have kept this in mind before they trusted this company with their bitcoins. I think being part of Bitcoin means learning to be personally responsible for your money and having accountability for your own decisions. People took a risky bet on a company that many warned was an obvious scam and those people got burned. Hopefully these 700,000 people learned an important lesson - if you don't hold the keys, you don't own the bitcoins.

While I agree with the article it is very poorly written and is simply a re-write of the New Scientist article it sources its material from, which they couldn't even bother to link to; a dick move that is typical of these kinds of garbage blogspam sites.
Here's the original source for those interested:
@_date: 2016-06-04 17:44:51
$566.79 x 5.356344 = $3,035.92
$3,035.92 x 1% fee = $30.36 fee
$3,035.92 - $30.36 = $3,005.56
It looks to me like you didn't account for the 1% transaction fee that Coinbase charges when you buy or sell Bitcoin. The extra $5 is probably taxes or something. You can usually look at the detailed transaction to see a break-down of the charges and how it's calculated.

Trying to time the market is messy business and usually doesn't work out in your favor. If you think bitcoin will be successful in the long term, years from now, then the price will have to be significantly higher than it is now, thus you should just buy and hold.
If you're just trying to gamble on short term price swings then I doubt you'll find many reputable sources/projections here, in which case good luck.
@_date: 2016-06-13 16:38:30
My opinion is it's still the starting leg of the next big bubble which will surpass the all time high, and based on that it'd be a good time to buy especially if you plan to hold on to it for the long term, as in years. That said, rule - don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

Bitcoin is being used, just not in traditional ways we use money, it's used in niche cases where fiat might not make sense due to the transaction either being illegal or due to the banking system not catering to a particular group of people. For example:
* Buying/Selling drugs on darknet markets
* Buying ads on Backpage
* [Tipping camgirls]( while remaining anonymous and no chargebacks
* Buying games on places like Steam, Xbox when you don't have a CC because you're under 18
* [Buying/selling game assets](
* Online gambling
There are use cases for Bitcoin, and it is being used, just not for everyday stuff like buying groceries or paying rent, the use cases are for niche purposes where using fiat is not possible or very difficult, particularly what I call the 3Gs - girls, gambling, and gaming.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:38:33
Unfortunately that seems to be the case. Funnily enough, despite all the advice to hold your private keys, the ones profiting right now are those that kept their bitcoins on an exchange (that trades BCH), but of course that also comes with some counterparty risk... that said, I'm watching this like a hawk so that I can be one the first to get my BCH onto Bittrex and sell before the price plummets.

Depends on what your strategy is. If you're just in it to make a quick buck by trading the short term then it's probably a risky idea/gamble, but if you are in it for the long haul, as in years of hodling, then now is as good a time as any to buy. And I'll repeat the usual mantra - don't put in more than you can afford to lose.

Well first of all Coindesk is a blog not an exchange. Also, Circle is a bitcoin broker, also not an exchange.
Bitfinex has trading services that other exchanges don't have, like different types of leverage for example, however I do agree that if an exchange is acting badly/poorly then it'd make sense for traders to switch, which I think many will do after this recent issue.

I think we have and while not ideal, we're definitely in a much better situation than when Mt. Gox existed. 
We have many different exchanges now to spread the risk out. There is a consistent and repeated mantra to not keep long term funds in an exchange. In addition, we are seeing growing adoption of peer to peer and decentralized exchanges like Localbitcoins, Mycelium trader, and Bitsquare.io.
The Bitfinex shutdown was bad, but certainly nowhere as bad as what's happened to exchanges in the past, complete collapse, hacks, and stolen funds. I suspect they'll lose future business for it and the market will reward those exchanges that are able to operate more securely and without error. This is how the market is supposed to work and helps the bitcoin ecosystem become more anti-fragile.

Second of all, Chase is a shitty bank anyways, I'd recommend getting a Schwab checking account.

Your first mistake is investing in something without doing the proper research. Do you just do whatever your friends tell you to do?
Your second mistake is getting too emotional about short term swings. Bitcoin is a volatile asset, it shoots up high and falls hard, pretty normal behavior. That said, if you think Bitcoin will be successful long term then the price will need to be much higher than it is now, in which case just hodl tight and don't pay much attention to the daily price swings. 
However, if it's giving you anxiety and you can't sleep at night because your whole whopping $200 went down by 50 bucks then just sell and walk away, this is not for you.
Rule - don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

That's what I was thinking. In cryptoland, it's good for bitcoin because it reaffirms bitcoin as the most secure coin. 
However, outside of cryptoland, we know the mainstream media will fuck up the reporting on this and give out all kinds of bad and misleading information tying Bitcoin into this mess, thus giving Bitcoin the impression to those outside the cryptosphere that it's not safe or hackable or whatever.

It probably depends on the service, since many of them are using off-chain transactions to move internal funds around. That said, you really shouldn't be storing your bitcoin on an exchange. They're fine for buying from, but we have saying around here - **If you don't control the keys, you don't own the bitcoin.**

It's definitely possible, people around here do it all the time, trading between different fiat, Bitcoin, and other altcoins and if you're good at it you can make a bunch... but that's the thing, it's kind of hard to predict these markets and unless you have a background in trading then you'll likely just end up losing your shirt.

You don't need to create a new wallet on Coinbase, you can use the same one, just copy and paste the receiving address from your coinbase wallet, although it's not a good idea to keep your bitcoin Coinbase long term as you don't control the coins. Eventually, you'll want to keep them secure in a wallet you control - like Electrum - so long as it's backed up properly.

The main use-case at the moment seems to be as a censorship resistant store of value over a long time-frame.
Over time, as the technology gets better and better using things like Lightning Network where transactions happen instantly and for nearly free, it will become more like a currency used to buy and sell things.
As for taxes, yes agreed, it is not viable if you're obeying the law, however hopefully tax laws will change over time or the people using bitcoin will move to places where they don't tax on bitcoin transactions; in fact some countries have already passed favorable laws in that regard.
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:01:17
You could try [Bitstamp]( or [Cex.io]( both have credit/debit buying options.
@_date: 2017-01-04 03:53:27
There really aren't that many place that will do instant buys, especially without a higher premium due to the risk to the seller and the fact that they need to wait for transactions from the legacy banking sector to clear. At the moment Coinbase is probably your best/cheapest option for instant buys so it may be worth it to try to work on increasing your limit over time if that's something you need.

It's still considered a speculative investment and while there is a lot of upside potential, there is risk involved, thus it is often recommended that people do not "invest" more than they can afford to lose.

It increases the utility of the network by allowing more transactions per second that are instant, and can be smaller in size and cheaper in cost.

At others have mentioned, Bitcoin has a long history of exchange hacks and people losing their bitcoins. In addition, the whole point of Bitcoin is to be your own bank and be in control of your own money, fighting against the traditional fractional reserve banking system, so when you keep your bitcoin in a "Bitcoin Bank" not in your control, then that is completely antithetical to the whole ethos of Bitcoin.

The 3 Gs - Girls, Gambling, and Gaming
**Girls** - cam sites like [Xotika.tv]( benefits the girls since there are no chargebacks and it benefits the users because they can tip and participate without giving any CC or identity info, same goes for porn sites. Also, escorts use Bitcoin for Backpage ads. I see Bitcoin continue to encroach in the sex industry.
An opportunity I see is a dating site like AshleyMadison except it uses Bitcoin and stores no user identity information which would be your selling point as a comparison to the AM hack earlier in the year.
**Gambling** - pretty self explanatory but with the recent heat on those fantasy sports site, their is some opening there for crypto.
**Gaming** - Another market for the underserved, kids who don't have access to the traditional banking network but want to spend money on games online. Steam and XBox Live accept bitcoin payments. Also, there is a growing industry of people selling in game items like CS:GO weapons for Bitcoin ([Opskins]( or things like [Runescape gold]( for example. In addition, games are starting to create tradeable game asset tokens on CounterParty with Sarutobi and Spells of Genesis as an example. Some games you earn and use small amounts of bitcoin as in-game money like [Bitquest]( or [Chopcoin.io]( for example.
I see gaming being a very big part of the Bitcoin ecosystem and if you can figure out a way to create a good marketplace for certain game items or create a popular game that incorporates bitcoin, that'd be a pretty solid opportunity I think.

I bought my first Bitcoin at $980 about three years ago during the last bubble and have held ever since. Not only that, but I bought all the way down to the low $200s and back up again... and my portfolio has been quite profitable despite any short term turbulence during that time.
Look people, it's not like bitcoin isn't known for being volatile, it's mentioned in every article and constantly brought up, so I have little sympathy for those that bought and just assumed it would keep going up. If you can't handle the short term swings then you shouldn't be invested in bitcoin. Patience is a virtue and those who hold over the long term will be rewarded.

I think the first thing to do is to download a decent wallet, one which you control the keys, and just take some time figuring out how to send/receive bitcoin. I recommend [Airbitz]( as it is both user friendly and has good security.
Then after that, you can either buy bitcoin from the integrated buy/sell feature in Airbitz which lets you exchange with the Kraken exchange or buy from some other place like Coinbase or a bitcoin ATM or Localbitcoins.
If you want, I'll send you a small amount of bitcoin to test out once you setup a wallet, just PM your receiving address :)

In regards to this issue, I'd argue that price-gouging is actually good and helpful to society. If you understand basic economics then you know that price is a signaling mechanism for the supply and demand of a good or service. By allowing price gouging, which is simply just raising prices higher than what people might consider normal, you signal and incentivize more supply to come on board where it is needed until it comes back under a "normal" equilibrium.
This video explains the position well:

Please ignore Pokertravis, he has a history of being a major dick around here and constantly throws out baseless allegations, don't let that reflect on the rest of us.
As for your transaction, the fee is a little low and there is some back log of unconfirmed transactions so it could take some time and eventually go through. There is a way to resend it with a higher fee but I'm afraid I don't know how to do that - perhaps someone else will chime in.

This is because bitcoin brokers need to wait until the legacy payment system from your bank to clear in order to limit their risk, otherwise people could scam them out of bitcoins.
That said, you can get some amount of instant bitcoin if you add a credit card though the amount is limited, same with [Circle.com]( if you buy via credit or debit card.
Also, you could try the following which would give you quicker bitcoins by paying with cash:
* [LibertyX]( for cash
* [LocalBitcoins.com]( p2p trades
* [Mycelium Local Trader]( p2p trades
* [Any Bitcoin ATM]( for cash

Thank you for the follow-up.
I realize a lot of news sites, even mainstream ones do this, but that does not make it a good or ethical practice. And because the Bitcoin space is much more open to scams than other sectors, I feel it's important that the crypto news sites need to be much more vigilant about vetting this kind of stuff.
I think if you truly are a fan of Bitcoin and want to promote it and have it succeed then you should help to do your part as a news site to snuff out the scammers.

It doesn't seem like you want to control your bitcoins, you took them from a wallet where you control the keys to one where you don't. Not only that, but you didn't even bother to do any basic due diligence or research before giving them your coins - I mean a [simple one second google search]( would've been enough to throw up some red flags and at least give you a hint that this might not be a legit site.

You're talking about making it more divisible which is not the same as increasing the supply. If you were to make 1 cent divisible by another 100 units, you didn't actually create more money, you still have 1 cent worth. The same with Bitcoin, it's currently divisible by 8 decimal places and if you made it more divisible to 16 decimal places for example, the supply of 21 million bitcoins would remain, it's just much more divisible. So doing what you said wouldn't really change anything since the distribution would remain proportional to whatever the current allocation is.

If you don't control the keys you don't own the Bitcoin. Use a wallet that you control the private keys, not this garbage.
Like the early days of the Internet, the cryptocoin ecosystem is still very much the wild west, there's no government to get your back, which requires responsibility and due diligence before you just go around sending bitcoin to every two-bit scammer in the neighborhood.

* [LibertyX]( for cash
* [LocalBitcoins.com]( p2p trades
* [Mycelium Local Trader]( p2p trades
* [Any Bitcoin ATM]( for cash
Also, since you are buying from a "vendor who only takes bitcoin"... you'll want to transfer what you buy from to your own wallet that you control first - don't send directly to the vendor from Circle or Coinbase as that will raise red flags (assuming what you're buying is illegal).

Probably not if it takes you a week to get less than a dollar. Bitcoin is money and no one is just going to give away large amounts of it, the same way no one gives away large amounts of dollars.
You earn bitcoin the same way you earn any other money, trade your labor or goods for it. Of course, getting paid in bitcoin for work takes a little more effort and entrepreneurial spirit, but it could just be a matter of doing what you already do but offer your customers a discount if they pay you in bitcoin.
That said, here's a few sites that help facilitate earning bitcoin:
* [XBTfreelancer](
* [Cryptogrind](
* [Coinality](
* [Bitgigs](
* * [Rein Project](
**Market Places**
* [OpenBazaar](
* [Purse.io](

Yes you still receive the .21 btc or whatever is the agreed upon amount at the time you purchase. The reason it takes so long to actually get them is because Coinbase needs to wait for your ACH transaction from your bank to clear so they don't get screwed over in the event that a customer canceled a bank transaction and made off with the bitcoin.

What's your idea of going up "considerably", 100%, 200%, more?
Based on my in-depth financial calculations, if the price goes to $2000 in 6 months then your investment will be worth over $30 grand. By the way, you could probably do these kinds of estimates yourself with a calculator.

Your options are really limited to [Localbitcoins]( and [Paxful]( If you're worried about getting ripped off then pay attention to the ratings/reputations of the sellers and make sure to use the escrow systems. That said, buying anonymously comes at a premium, you're always gonna pay a higher price for it.
Also, Circle wasn't anonymous, you needed to provide identity information to buy from them so I'm not sure why bringing them up is relevant to your question.

It's not out of thin air, that person contributed to the network very early on and provided his computer to do mining which helped to secure the network and process transactions. Without these early miners who were providing proof of work to the network while bitcoin wasn't worth barely anything, we wouldn't have such a robust network today. That person was paid for his mining work for the network.
In addition, anyone could have mined in the early days, it was there for anyone to contribute to but many people didn't because they thought it was worthless or a joke or whatever. The people who mined in the early days and managed to hold on to those coins got rewarded for kickstarting the bitcoin network and it was fair in that it's open source and there for anyone to contribute to, just because you didn't get in on it doesn't mean it's not fair.

There's more but that's the basic gist.

Not in a general sense. You can buy different cryptocurrencies which you might consider an investment in those currencies' blockchains. For example, buying bitcoin is an investment of the bitcoin blockchain, buying ethereum is an investment in the ethereum blockchain, buying monero is an investment in the monero blockchain, etc, etc... there are also some companies working on private blockchains but I'm not aware of any way to invest in them nor do I see any reason why anyone would want to.
It doesn't sound like you actually know what a blockchain is; I'd recommend doing some more research before investing in anything. As Warren Buffet once said, "only invest in what you know."

The problem is that a lot of mainstream news reporters do a really poor job of reporting on bitcoin and often get a lot of things wrong and push out a lot of misinformation. So in my opinion, if a reporter actually makes an effort to use bitcoin and figure out how it works then that'll hopefully lead to more accurate reporting... but to be honest, I don't have much trust in journalists these days regardless, so it's probably a moot point.

Depends on what your investment horizon is. If you believe that bitcoin will be successful long term then the price will have to be significantly higher than it is now, so if you're willing to hold long term (years) then we're really just getting started. You won't do as well as your buddy who presumably got in really early, but their still a lot of potential here for gains over other assets. It's also riskier than other assets, so don't put in more than you can afford to lose.
If you're just here to gamble on short term price movements, then you're gonna have a bad time.

Well since bitcoin is money, any business is a bitcoin business if you accept it as a form of payment; and the best way to help the ecosystem grow would be to offer regular products and services at a decent discount if paid with bitcoin. If people recognize they can get really good deals by using bitcoin then they're more likely to seek out how to use it. It also helps to add liquidity to the system which is a key feature needed in a viable widely used currency.

Part of the security features of the wallet is that it isn't easy for anyone to access the funds unless they know the pin or wayyyy more importantly the recovery phrase which is tied to your private keys... which you didn't write down :(
I'd say write down the pin(s) you've tried so you know what doesn't work, then think really really hard about what the actual pin could possibly be.
Other than that, if you don't get it then just consider this a stupid tax or tuition spent on learning why you should backup your wallet - I mean it only takes like a minute to write down the words :|

Just because you aren't a gazillionaire yet doesn't mean that bitcoin is stagnating. There's been all sorts of development going on to move it forward. The core code has released segwit, and continues to give us improved updates of the client. There's several groups making a lot progress on lightening network implementations. There's progress on fungibility with things like Tumblebit and Joinmarket. We see increasing actual use cases for bitcoin like in the gambling industry for example with lots of sites adding bitcoin infrastructure as a payment/transaction method. We see increasing use of bitcoin as a remittance service with companies like coins.ph or Abra. The exchanges continue to improve and up their game. Wallets are getting better and better.

Depends on what your outlook is. If you believe in Bitcoin's long term success and are going to be holding for the long term (years) while not panicking during short term volatility then now is as good a time as any - perhaps a dollar cost averaging strategy would be even better, putting in small fixed amounts on a regular basis.
But, if you're just here to gamble on short term price swings, then who the hell knows, best to go read the daily discussion threads in and maybe you'll get lucky and not lose all your money right away.

The people who got in early took a big risk by buying a new risky and experimental digital asset with no promise to ever get a decent return.

The good news is that no one is forcing anyone to use or participate in the bitcoin system. If you don't think it's fair or useful for you then you don't have to use it. That's the beauty of voluntary markets.

When you loan money, regardless of whether it's bitcoin or dollars or whatever, you by default agree to take on the risk that the person will default. There's no gurantees on loan repayments especially in an unregulated bitcoin p2p loan site. I doubt there's much you can do other than keep bugging them and hope they repay.
I'd take this as a lesson - if you don't want to lose your bitcoin then don't let other people hold it. Heck, just holding bitcoin is already an amazing investment by itself; I don't understand why people would risk them with third parties for a measly few more percentage points...

According to this bill, it would exclude all taxes on virtual currencies for commerce.

My goal is to always get rid of my fiat first while increasing my bitcoins. It needs to be a store of value before it can be a currency.
I think an even better strategy would be for people to focus on SELLING things for bitcoin at a very discounted rate. This willingness to trade valuable stuff for cheaper than what they could get in fiat would be a much better driver for the Bitcoin economy then to simply encourage people to spend bitcoin.

I'm not sure, but I think since bitcoin purchases may count as a cash advance, as opposed to a purchase of goods and services, then they might incur a higher processing fee... not to mention, they're more at risk to chargebacks as well, so that might also add to the cost. I'm sure there's a good reason. I believe Circle had similar fee for their card purchases as well.
That said, you can always go with an ACH trasfer for cheaper.

He is either trying to scam you or he is ignorant and caught up in a scam, most likely some kind of cloud mining operation I would guess, or he simply has no idea what he's doing because you can't practically mine bitcoin for that low amount of investment.

Most scaling will be done on the second layers. It's possible we may need to scale the main chain (first layer) but careful analysis of the data is needed after segwit activates to see how the network behaves.


No they haven't, they're saying that Segwit + Lightening Networks can scale to those levels.


No these are still second layer solutions, just different types of technology, the point is we have options now that segwit will activate so if one second layer doesn't work we can look to others, or they all work and compete with each other based on whatever is most efficient and less costly to run.

I've seen posts in the past about people inquiring about sending/donating bitcoin to the people of Venezuela, but I think a far better approach to helping is to actually hire people for bitcoin - actually use bitcoin in exchange for goods and services, and a great way to do that is through these freelance sites like [XBTfreelancer]( and [Cryptogrind]( for example. This way you are actually helping to kickstart the Bitcoin economy, giving it value which can be exchanged directly for goods and services rather than be a commodity traded on an exchange.

Airbitz is very good for a wallet which you control the keys. Circle is probably fine for now if you are a noob and don't really know what you're doing yet, but keep in mind that Circle is essentially the same as a bank and thus they have control of your funds.
The finite number of Bitcoin is meant to give it scarcity similar to gold and thus be a valuable commodity. At the time of this post, [15,668,750]( bitcoin have been issued so far.

Hi Roger, I think that most people who have been around awhile and have gotten a good grasp of bitcoin are eventually made aware of and all the other channels for disseminating bitcoin related content from other forums (bitcoin.com for example), bitcoin news sites, podcasts, etc... so it's not like anyone who's involved in bitcoin isn't aware of the competing clients and the scaling debate; it's almost impossible to avoid it if you wanted to.
You may be right that a noob coming to for the first time might not be aware of other clients, but a noob at that point is so limited in their technical knowledge of bitcoin that they probably wouldn't even understand the basic concept of a client let alone be able to form any kind of educated opinion on the scaling the debate anyways. I'd even argue that most of us who have been around for some time still don't have the technical chops to form a good opinion on the matter.
All that said, this crusade of yours just seems like it's some petty grudge against the mods and is in spite of well written Core code, code that would help to move bitcoin forward and scale, and consequently make you richer.

Buying bitcoin online via bank transfer or credit/debit card is almost always going to require giving up some information due to KYC/AML laws imposed by most countries. There are ways to get it more anonymously but it is a bit more complicated and sometimes more costly.

That said, here's a few ways that you can try that don't require as much or any information:

If you're just in to bitcoin to gamble on short term price swings then yea, sell and take your profit while you can before you lose it trying to time the market.

We really can't make financial decisions for you, that's your responsibility. A lot of people here believe in the long term success of Bitcoin and that the price will be much much higher many years from now and so they invest in it. Now it's up to you to do your research on Bitcoin and figure out whether you believe the same, if so then it might be worth it to buy in, even better take a [Dollar Cost Averaging approach]( and hodl on to it for the long term, and don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

Why would you even think this?

Yes, bitcoins would be kind of useless if you could only transact in $4,000 increments. Each bitcoin is divisible by 8 decimal places or 100 million units, so it's possible to own bitcoins that are only worth a fraction of a cent.

Desktop systems tend to be much more vulnerable to malware, viruses, and other malicious programs that might try to steal your bitcoins. Not to say that mobile's are full-proof, just better, you still need to make sure you're not installing any sketchy apps. One reason I really like Airbitz is because you can enable the built-in two factor authentication which adds another level of security which is nice.
I don't personally recommend syncing across multiple devices as that simply increases your attack surface. That said, it doesn't mean you can't have multiple wallets on multiple devices.

Segwit is an upgrade that increases the blocksize slightly but does not enable zero transaction fees, not sure where you heard that; but what it DOES do is fix the maelibility bug, which in turn helps enable second layer scaling solutions like Lightening Network that DOES enable very low fee and instant transactions at high volume.

I'd recommend starting with reading through the [Newcomer's thread]( there's tons of information in there on getting started in Bitcoin.
If you're looking for other exchanges to buy from other than GDAX/Coinbase, then the following are decent, although keep in mind that due to the increased popularity of Bitcoin and cryptos in general, many exchanges are experiencing similar support issues.
* [Gemini](
* [Bitstamp](
* [Kraken](
As for other coins, this isn't really a place for that, mostly bitcoin centric around here, but my personal opinion is that Litecoin, Monero, Byteball are other interesting projects; but this should not be taken as investment advice, just something to research for yourself. My advice, is research Bitcoin first and understand how it works and how to use it safely before jumping into other coins otherwise there's a lot of potential to be scammed.

It's usually almost always better to just buy bitcoin than mining. You can forget about trying to mine with a laptop, it'd maybe earn a few cents per year if you were lucky, so you'd have to spend money on an ASIC miner to even have a reasonable chance of breaking even in a few years. Do a search for "bitcoin mining calculator" and plug the numbers in to see if it makes sense for you. Also, check out sub for more information on this type of stuff.

It's a lot easier for Bitcoin to go "mainstream" if it has a higher marketcap so as to have the ability to facilitate more and more businesses, which requires more and more hoarders wanting to buy bitcoin. I'd highly recommend reading the following article:
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:47:54
Coinbase is a broker where you buy and sell bitcoin, and they have a built in wallet that lets you store, send, and receive bitcoin. You could leave your coins there but it's generally not recommended that you keep your money on an exchange or in the hands of a third party.
If you're looking for a wallet which you control the keys, I'd recommend any of the following for their ease of use and good security:
* [Airbitz]( iPhone or Android
* [Breadwallet]( iPhone or Android
* [Electrum]( Desktop
* [Trezor]( Hardware
* [Ledger Nano S]( Hardware
You can send any amount of bitcoin to and from any wallet so that's not an issue, however, if you are cashing out/selling/buying on an exchange then there may be some limits involved depending on the policies of that particular exchange.
@_date: 2016-06-17 03:23:09
Oh nice, now I can get all the blogspam in one place.

Some of the exchanges will give you a small amount of interest for lending to margin traders so you could check that out.
Also, there is which you can earn around 2% apr by tumbling coins although it's a bit technical and difficult to get setup and running.
That said, just holding bitcoin itself is a pretty great investment and would be very cautious about risking it with third parties. In my opinion the best savings option would be to put your bitcoins into a secure hardware wallet like a trezor or ledger and just send bitcoin to it without spending it.
Edit: I'd also add that just getting into bitcoin might be enough to change your spending habits as many people in this community have attested to becoming better savers due to their bitcoin hobby.

You have more than enough to start trading, but the question is should you? We can't really tell you that as it is up to your own personal willingness to take on risk.
If you're an experienced trader already and know what you're doing then go for it, but it seems to me like you haven't traded before in which case I'd recommend just holding for the long term, otherwise you will just drive yourself nuts with anxiety trying to time this crazy market we call Bitcoin and likely end up losing more than you make.

If what you say is true then every single person would be making the minimum wage, but in reality only a very small percentage of the workforce actually earn minimum wage, most earn more than that to varying degrees depending on their skill and supply/demand of labor for whatever their job is.
We already have a great example of a country that doesn't even have a minimum wage law and yet still has decent wage rates for low skilled jobs - Denmark.
Minimum wage ends up hurting more people than it helps since it means businesses will hire less and less unskilled labor.

1. There's a good reason for the 10 minute block time, it's a bit technical but basically needed to allow information on the network to propagate without orphaning a bunch of blocks. Regardless, transaction speeds and costs will be greatly improved with second layer scaling solutions like LN as one example, it just takes some time to develop, but we're getting there :)
2. The market cap of Bitcoin is still pretty small compared to major currencies but as it increases, along with liquidity, this should smooth out and become more stable with less volatility.
3. Setting up a wallet is as simple as downloading it from an appstore on to your phone, no PhD needed, most people can setup a wallet in about 5 minutes.
4. Agreed the UX does need improvement, but again, there's people working on this stuff. When the Internet was first getting started it was quite similar, difficult to use and figure out, but over time that improved. That said, a basic mobile wallet like Breadwallet or Airbitz has a pretty basic UI, there's a send and receive button, and really not that hard to figure out.
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:11:15
Bitcoin's history is rife with exchanges getting hacked or exit scamming, and a lot of people have lost a lot of money by trusting third parties with their bitcoin.

Using bitcoin as payment method only really makes sense when I can't use a credit card as that method offers superior service at the moment such as points/cashback, warranty protection, chargebacks, etc.
I see bitcoin more like gold, as a store of value that will increase over time, and thus if anyone is trying to convince me to give them a better money then they should offer some kind incentive if they want bitcoin over fiat.

You display the bonus amounts in people's accounts as if it belongs to them, but the truth is it doesn't, it is simply a ploy to get people to deposit more money.


Who are you to decide if an account is forgotten or not, isn't the whole point of a secure gold vault the ability to leave gold in there for a long period of time and be able to trust that'll still be there when you come back? Honestly, the whole "Reclaiming" forgotten gold doesn't inspire any trust in your service and if I was on the fence before, I'm definitely not trusting you now.

1.5% really is pretty good compared to other methods like Localbitcoins or BTMs which are significantly higher fees. That said, if you sign-up for an exchange like Gemini, GDAX, Bitstamp, or Kraken, then you can get much lower fees but it's more complicated since you're dealing with a real exchange and not just a broker service.

The newcomers thread and FAQ is a good place to get started:
Also, I think one of the best ways to learn is to just start using it by downloading a wallet and sending/receiving small amounts of bits.
I'd recommend the following wallets as they offer both good security and usability:
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)
* [Breadwallet]( (iPhone or Android)
* [Mycelium]( (Android)
* [Jaxx]( (all devices)
* [Electrum]( (Desktop)
Once you pick a wallet and get it setup, PM your receiving address and I'll send you some bits for you to play around with :)
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:48:41
Almost all of us were skeptical of it at some point until we better understood the ramifications both technically and economically. Welcome down the rabbit hole :)

If the person receiving it doesn't know what it is or doesn't care about bitcoin, which is still most people, then they'll likely feel insulted and will be perceived no differently those people who leave those stupid prayer cards as a tip.
I think if you want to leave a bitcoin tip then first ask the person if they'd rather have cash or bitcoin, then give them their preferred choice.
Read the following Reddit story from awhile back about how horribly this could go:

You made a CLAIM that some people are spreading a false narrative, ok, that is an accusation of someone(s) saying something false. All I am asking you is to back up your claim and point out what was said that was false???? Seriously man, how hard is that? And yes, if you're not able to back up your claims then yes you are irrational and inconsistent.

If bitcoin ever reaches $1 million or even $100k, then you won't have to sell for some crummy fiat, you'll be using it to buy goods and services directly, that should be the long term goal of any true hodler.

You'd make more money if you just sold them for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:24:00
Each bitcoin are divisible by up to 8 decimal places or 100 million units, thus as supply decreases people would just move to smaller units of accounts, and if that's not enough then we could just make them more divisible, thus even if there were just 1 bitcoin left that is accessible it'd still be enough for everyone to transact with.

I hear ya, I'm a little annoyed too, however I can't blame the wallets for bugs in bcash especially considering how little time they had to get these integrated. That said, it's certainly a bit ironic that the people in the best positions to profit are the ones who kept btc on an exchange... albeit ones that have offered the splitting service.

Agreed, and going back to the bus analogy that everyone is so fond of - if you can have a double decker bus (increased capacity via segwit) for the same cost as a single decker, wouldn't it make sense to start putting those double deckers on the route before ramping up bus production?

Segwit has nothing to do with whether or not you should keep your coins on an exchange which is generally not recommended. I'd recommend watching the following video by Andreas which explains why you should keep coins in a wallet where you control the private keys:

$15 for a 4 page short story... I don't think you'll get many buyers, if any. If I had to put a price on a short story, I'd say no more than 50 cents max or around 1000 bits would be fair.

We really can't make financial decisions for you, that's your responsibility. A lot of people here believe in the long term success of Bitcoin and that the price will be much much higher many years from now and so they invest in it. Now it's up to you to do your research on Bitcoin and figure out whether you believe the same, if so then it might be worth it to buy in, even better take a [Dollar Cost Averaging approach]( and hodl on to it for the long term, and don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

So you want someone to provide an exchange service, with all the hassle and compliance and costs to you for free, just out of the goodness of their hearts?
Sorry, but these types of services cost money; it's true for pretty much any type of exchange service whether stocks, bonds, forex, or bitcoin.
Coinbase.com charges 1.5% for buys using ACH transfers and is pretty good compared to some other services like ATMs or Localbitcoins where you're paying much more than that.
You can get cheaper rates by going through a more traditional style exchange like GDAX, Gemini, Bitstamp, Kraken but they're a little more complicated in the process.

Sure it makes sense to get it for as cheap as you can but also consider that time and accessibility factor in. Depending on where you live and your payment method, it will narrow the the places you can buy from, so you'll have to shop around and do a little research.

If Bitcoin takes off and begins to rival other major currencies, you won't see governments shutting these things down, no, they're too valuable and too risky to shut down a money making plant. Instead, what I think we'll see is an arms race of giant bitcoin mining data centers amongst the world powers... and China has a pretty significant head start. 
Would a rational country ban gold and silver mining? Would a rational country ban all oil drilling and usage? Bitcoin represents a valuable commodity and it's for these reasons that the fears of China trying ban or shutdown Bitcoin are likely unrealistic in the long term, especially since their deck is stacked! 
@_date: 2016-11-14 19:35:50
The best bitcoin investment is to hold on to them in a secure wallet that you control. That said, even if you wanted to do something with your satoshis, the amount is so small that you'd lose most of it just from the transaction fee. 
My suggestion would be to focus on getting more bitcoin first, perhaps do some work for them or buy some.

I don't think it's ever a good idea to either give a loan or take a loan from a family member, it usually doesn't end well, especially when the loan is for speculative investments...
That said, whether bitcoin is a good investment is really for you to decide and do some research on. A lot of people here think it'll be a lot higher in the future but consider that most of us are invested in it and probably biased in that regard.
One thing I'd say you should consider is that it doesn't work out, are you willing and able to pay the loan back if your bitcoin investment tanks?
One of our sayings around here is don't invest more than you can afford to lose, and I think losing your dad's money would fit in there.
@_date: 2016-12-17 17:13:46
There should always be mining so long as bitcoin has price and there's no obligation of the users of bitcoin to follow any fork that a miner does.
 I agree with your points on the usefulness of cash. That said, you can't conduct commerce on the Internet with cash and since we're living in the 21st century, that ability/utility will be more and more important.
In the title of this post you asked what the point of Bitcoin was, which implied to me that you're suggesting there is no point, even though it clearly has it's use cases.
Like I said, it's not for everyone and I guess if you like using cash then you should keep using cash. No one is forcing anyone to use Bitcoin and it will stand on it's own merits or lack thereof over time.

You won't make much from mining with your mac, maybe a few cents a year, and you'd probably spend way more on electricity costs. To mine these days you need specific mining hardware, cheap or free electricity, and the technical knowledge to do so.

* Check for some good suggestions on getting bitcoins and other crypto game assets from games.
* The easiest ways to exchange USD to Bitcoin is using a broker service like [Circle.com]( or [Coinbase.com]( but there's other ways like Bitcoin ATMs or actual exchanges.
* Bitcoin miners are using high end hardware to solve a mathematical problem and if they solve it first they get bitcoin and profit. We don't know if there will be another boom but it is looking pretty bullish lately.

I don't see how this is a problem.

Yes, cryptocurrency are here to stay, the technology behind Bitcoin solves some fundamental problems in both computer science, accounting, and economics that are too useful to be temporary blips on the radar. Granted there is still a lot of work to be done to make them practical for the masses, similar to the early days of the Internet; and I suspect there will be A LOT of cryptocurrencies that fail along the way, also similar to the early days of the Internet... but the ones that survive, hopefully Bitcoin, will likely be world changing, in my opinion.

Wait, I don't get the strategy here... wouldn't you want to buy more bitcoin if you were taking advantage of the dip? What's the purpose of selling when the price is going down? Pretty sure the old mantra of "buy low, sell high" is still an effective strategy, not the opposite.
Also, pretty sure that freaking out and panic selling is a sure way to lose money. I'd recommend just being patient and hodl for the long term.

We don't know what the price is going to do in the short term. In the long term (years from now), a lot of people here believe it is going to be worth a lot more than it is now, so take that for what you will.
That said, trying to time the market is a fool's errand, you'll just drive yourself nuts with anxiety watching the price. If you believe in the long term success of Bitcoin then just buy and hold, and don't worry too much about short term fluctuations. An even better strategy would be to dollar cost average into it by investing a fixed amount on a regular basis over time. If you're just here to gamble on the price and get rich quick then you're going to have a bad time.

Wow someone is mad. There's huge demand for bitcoin in darknet markets, gambling, digital game assets, remittances, and capital flight. And yes, there's a lot of speculation too, nothing wrong with that, were still in the early stages.

@_date: 2016-11-27 05:55:58
I haven't stuck exactly to this advice, but dollar cost averaging seems to be one of the better strategies, outside of owning a time traveling DeLorean, but buying a fixed amount on a regular interval like every week or month would prove to give positive gains in your portfolio value even if you started buying at the peak of the last bubble.
My own personal strategy has been buying between $50-200 worth of bitcoin a month. I bought my first bitcoins at $980ish. I kept buying all the way down to the low 200s and back up to the current date where I'm up about 170% or so on my total portfolio... although I haven't updated my spreadsheet recently so it could be more.

PC mining for bitcoin hasn't been worth it for a long time and you'd be luck to earn a few cents per month with that thing. You really need an ASIC to even have a chance of getting anything.

From my understanding Fivver was simply converting the bitcoin directly to fiat and the freelancers didn't actually get paid in bitcoin, so it wasn't really that great for the Bitcoin economy anyways since it just added sell pressure to the price rather than encourage a circular economy.

Indeed, but something to keep in mind for inclusion as part of a future planned hard fork, should one happen.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:37:16
The whole thing was quite rushed and a lot of people didn't even know it was happening until a week leading up to the hardfork event, and thus caught everyone off guard including users, exchanges, and wallets - just look at the number of new posts constantly streaming in from users in both r/btc and r/bitcoin trying to figure out what the heck to do on claiming their bcash.
In addition to that, their devs didn't even bother to check if the BCC ticker was taken, which it is by Bitconnect, only leading to more confusion on what the heck this thing is even called.
On top of that there is very little documentation/guides for people making the transition, which if you want bitcoin cash to actually have people using it, which is what I thought the whole point of Bitcoin Cash was then that could have been handled better. Heck some of the better guides/advice for this have come for Core supporters.
In my opinion the whole thing was rushed and sloppy, but whatever, it's done now and the new coin, whatever the heck it's being called now can go on its merry way.
Now only if it can start mining some faster blocks so I can cash out.

Ahhhh man, sorry to break it to you, but a 'bit' is simply a smaller denomination of a bitcoin. Basically 1 bit is the equivalent of a millionth of a bitcoin or another way to put it, 1 million bits = 1 Bitcoin. So you actually have about 12 cents worth of bitcoin.

When you were sending the transaction from the site, it must have had you enter an address to send it to, correct? Where did you get that address, it should be one in your bitcoin wallet.

You said it's only worth about $4 right now so probably not worth the effort to cash it out.
If my calculations are correct, you have about .005 bitcoin, so if this thing takes off and becomes a mainstream currency sometime in the future and hits $1 million per bitcoin, then you'll have a cool $5000 worth of extra purchasing power to your name.

Not sure why that person thinks bitcoin is getting less used, transactions continue to increase and exchange volume is continuing to increase across all markets so the evidence suggests that usage has been continuing to increase, not decrease.
As far as layer 2 solutions, there has been a lot of work on various implementations of lightening network and sidechains, and there is actual written and in some cases working code for these, so hardly vaporware. There already exists a working [Elements sidechain]( in addition a [demonstration of lightening network]( just last month, these are in addition to other work being done in this area.
It's unfortunate that there is a small subset of the Bitcoin community that seems to have this impression that there is no scaling work being done when it is quite the opposite, and it's even worse that a particular public figure in this space wants to block all of this work done that will help make Bitcoin a truly scalable worldwide global payments network.

The fee was actually 34 cents and as someone else mentioned Circle pays the transaction fees. The reason your $60 of BTC lost $1.07 in value is likely due to a change in the bitcoin price. If you check your Circle wallet the amount of bitcoin sent should be the same.

So I don't really agree with your analogy and not sure it's even related to the mining topic, but you seem to make an assumption that workers are equally skilled while ignoring the supply/demand effects of labor markets. While unskilled workers wages could certainly go very low, skilled workers in whatever industry they reside can demand a higher wage simply due to limited supply of a particular skill - no unions or collusion are need for this, just economics 101.
As for miners, the profit incentive of getting the block reward and to a lesser extent, the transaction fees, are enough that you'll continually get new miners on board and working for the network despite them only being in it for short term gains. You get this sort of continuos cycle of new mining equipment coming on the network, working to recoup it's costs, and make a little profit for the next set of mining hardware.

The price is determined by simple supply and demand and is traded on many different exchanges against other currencies, the same way that other currencies trade against each other, and thus the reason why it changes over time.
Your 1000 bits will remain 1000 bits unless you add more to your wallet. What changes is the willingness for someone to buy those bits from you for a certain amount of fiat money such as US Dollars for example. There are no splits in the sense of a stock split, however bitcoins are divisible, the same way that 1 Dollar is divisible by 100 cents.
Any kind of money benefits from a network effect, thus the more people that use it, the more valuable it becomes.
We don't know which way the price is going to go, it is a volatile currency, however it is becoming more stable over time and a lot of people in this community expect the price to continue to rise over the long term even though there may be a lot of ups and downs in the short term.
I'd recommend to keep reading and doing research, check out those links I posted above, watch youtube videos on it, learn some more about what money is, and you'll get the hang of it :)

Gold. It started off as direct peer to peer settlement system between the involved parties, then eventually had pieces of paper issued that represented the gold (layer 2 system), while the actual physical transfer of gold continued on as the layer 1 settlement system.
You could argue that many types of money in history were settlement systems to start since transactions involved physical transfer of the money. When you exchange a few pieces of gold for some cattle, then the transaction is complete and considered *settled*. When I hand over $3 in cash for a coffee, the transaction is *settled*, as opposed to paying with a credit card where it's not settled. Bitcoin's mainchain is also a settlement system since the actual confirmed transaction on the blockchain is considered *settled* and complete.

I honestly don't think the President will effect the price of bitcoin that much. 
Although, one thing that could effect the price that I haven't seen anyone talk about is the possible legalization of marijuana in six more states. Since bitcoin is mostly used as regulatory arbitrage, the legalizing of weed that would normally be bought on DNMs could have a longer term negative impact on the value of bitcoin.

To get the best price, closest to spot price, then you'd have to go through an actual exchange like the following:

* [Kraken](
* [Bitstamp](
* [Bitfinex](
* [GDAX](

Well a 10% discount is pretty good and if I were buying something then I would probably use bitcoin for that benefit, but the problem is I don't even see this advertised on any of the listings on the site, nor do I even see the bitcoin logo, or option to pay in bitcoin in the listings. It seems to me like the site design doesn't do a very good job of promoting bitcoin as a payment method.

Well the first thing you could do is mention on your website that you accept bitcoin as payment, and offer a discount to people who pay you in bitcoin if you really want it.
Also, you could offer your services or look for gigs on various bitcoin freelance sites. Here's a few options:
* [XBTfreelancer](
* [Cryptogrind](
* [Bitlancerr](

I'd recommend [Airbitz wallet]( it's very user friendly, great security with built-in 2 factor auth, works on both iPhone and Android, and has a lot of great features. It even has an integrated buy/sell feature via Kraken exchange which is quite reputable.
@_date: 2019-08-10 18:58:21
Eh, I think your logic might be off on that, but regardless I wouldn't tip in Bitcoin anyways unless you knew the waiter/waitress preferred it over cash; otherwise you could come off as a dick for not leaving a proper cash tip.

I've been already using bits in my wallets for quite some time now, but yes I agree, it'd be nice if exchanges and other services started using a smaller unit of account, kind of hard to enforce though.

It's tough to listen to the Crypto Show since they have so many breaks were they cut to commercial for their radio audience which is unfortunate because the guests really don't have much time to fully explain and expand on what they're talking about so you just end up with a bunch of little sound bites in between the chop, it's a little frustrating if you want to hear the guests get more in-depth on what they're working on.
@_date: 2016-11-16 21:09:03
The first thing to do is to setup a wallet you control and move the bitcoins to it. I'd recommend any of the following which offer both usability and security:
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)
* [Breadwallet]( (iPhone or Android)
* [Mycelium]( (Android)
* [Copay]( (all devices)
* [Jaxx]( (all devices)
* [Electrum]( (Desktop)
* [Trezor]( (Hardware)
* [Ledger Nano S]( (Hardware)
Just make sure you follow the appropriate backup procedures for whatever wallet you choose.
Once you have them in your wallet, you'll need to either find a place to sell them like Coinbase.com, Circle.com, Localbitcoins.com, or a number of different exchanges OR buy stuff directly with bitcoin OR hold on to them as their value increases over time.
Airbitz may be a good option for you since they integrate a buy/sell bitcoins feature via Gildera which allows you to transfer to a bank account.
@_date: 2016-11-22 16:02:54
I think this is the point, not everybody uses the main bank wire transfer network for their everyday transactions, only very important ones. When a consumer wants to buy a cup of coffee they don't send a wire, they use a second layer scaling solution like a credit card. Different needs require different payment methods even though you're still using the same currency.
@_date: 2016-11-22 17:01:15
It's not a default belief, it's the realization that the blockchain is not some magical thing that everyone can use for free, there are costs and resource use associated with running such a secure, decentralized, and immutable network and it's important to recognize the impossibility of fitting all the world's transactions on it is not feasible.

No, there are a bunch more exchanges all with their own data, in addition to other people gathering this stuff. I'm not a trader so I can't give specifics at the moment, but I'd recommend checking the sidebar of where they link to a ton of sites offering the data you're looking for, although some information might not be possible, like number of new users for example.
@_date: 2016-11-05 20:54:17
You seem very angry about this, something that no one is forcing you to use or buy or even pay attention to if you don't want to. It sounds like Bitcoin is not for you, so I guess just don't buy or use it, pretty simple actually and you'll save yourself from a lot of stress and anxiety from writing these angry posts.

They're really struggling, need to add some more hamster wheels to their server. That said, I'm becoming more and more impressed with the folks running Bittrex, they seem to have their shit together.

Ah yes, buy high and sell low, great strategy for losing money. Look, if you can't handle short term swings like this then you shouldn't be in bitcoin. The people who make money in BTC are the ones who don't panic during the turbulence and have the patience to hold long term, as in years.

A full node takes up resources, a decent chunk of space for the blockchain, time to sync it up, and a decent internet connection with good upload to connect with peers.
As someone who is setting up his first full node after being in this community for over three years, I must say, it's a bit of a pain, my node has been syncing/downloading the blockchain for about 10 days now and still 27 weeks behind... so I can see why this is not that common, and to think there are people in our community that want to make running a node even more difficult by increasing blocksize.
@_date: 2016-11-06 20:56:09
Yes, it could have been increased but the core devs focused on optimizing the current capacity first via segwit which also comes with many other benefits, particularly solving transaction mailability which will enable second layer scaling solutions like lightening network among other things that allow us to move this thing forward.
The current core implementation has been worked on and tested extensively for over a year now and the code has been deployed and could possibly be activated by end of year. Doing a hard fork would likely take at least another six months to prepare for assuming you could even get a majority on board. In addition, the alternative client, Bitcoin Unlimited, has not released code that solves transaction mailability via its flexible transactions and is unclear when it will be ready if at all.
That said, you've simply stated that we could/should increase blocksize, but it is still not clear from your comment what your doubts about segwit are?
@_date: 2016-11-22 05:13:35
What wallet did you have it in?
@_date: 2016-11-17 02:28:19
Why not just sign up for an exchange, sell the coins, then transfer the funds to your bank account?
Obviously you'll get hit with some capital gains taxes on the sale of the coins but I really don't see how you explain where you get this extra money to buy a house with otherwise.
@_date: 2016-11-30 04:55:25
Keep it safe and secure in a wallet you control the private keys to. Make sure it's backed up and hold on to it for the long term as price hopefully increases over time.

Depends on if you believe in Bitcoin's long term success and you're able to hold despite short term volatility without panic selling.

* [Jaxx]( (all devices)
* [Electrum]( (Desktop)

The miners main revenue is from the block subsidy and trans fees are secondary, thus it's in their best interest if the price of bitcoin is higher, and if LN helps to make bitcoin successful then it's a win for everyone.

Some good places to buy are:
* [Coinbase.com]( for bank transfer and debit card
* [LibertyX]( for cash

* [Any Bitcoin ATM]( for cash
You can also buy from wallets with integrated buying features such as [Airbitz]( and [Mycelium wallet](
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:41:54
The best way to invest is to hold on to these in a secure wallet that you control and hopefully watch as the price appreciates over the long term.

It's usually a little more tame with better in-depth discussions during the slow times but you've happened upon us in a big run up and if I've learned anything over the years from - it's that the level of shit posting is positively correlated to the rate of price increase.

Better in the sense that you can control your private keys with bci as opposed to Coinbase which is controlling the keys, but I don't really like either one as a wallet to be honest.

If the price goes to the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions, then buying in the thousands is still a steal.
My strategy is to set aside a small amount of money that I don't need or don't care about losing and buy bitcoin. It's been quite 
profitable so far.

I think you're going to need to provide us with some more details or information or links on what you are trying to do as your question is a bit confusing.

Congrats! Yes it can be confusing and daunting at first but once people actually try it out and start using it, it is very eye opening and exciting.
You can sell/trade your bitcoin for USD or any other currency or even other cryptocurrencies and just like any other market exchange there is usually a cost or small fee for the service. Coinbase does allow you to sell for USD and charges 1.5% fee to do so. However, I'd recommend not selling but either holding on to it or buying goods or services directly with Bitcoin.
Welcome down the rabbit hole, here's a few more bits to play with :)

Because I use Coinbase all the time and the ACH transfers from my bank always take at least several days to a week to clear, not to mention that Coinbase actually tells you that it will take 3-5 business days to release your Bitcoins, so it doesn't seem like the OP was paying attention and is getting all worked up over standard procedure. In addition, this amount of settlement time is pretty common knowledge for the ACH network regardless of the service you use.

No one will take a credit card without ID in order to protect themselves from credit card fraud. If you're using a credit card then you are already giving up your identity anyways, so why not just give the ID info?

I assume you wouldn't want to press charges against him, but I'd highly recommend you sit down and have a serious discussion about him using your identity, get your name and money out of there and just let him do his own thing with his own name and his own money. I can't stress enough how much you need to let him know of your desire for financial and identity control.

Do you offer any incentive for people to pay in Bitcoin, like a significant discount over fiat payments?
I think the reason why many merchants don't see bitcoin transactions is because it is just another payment system to them and if they actually valued bitcoin more than fiat then they'd do more to encourage bitcoin payments. Otherwise, given the same price, it is more advantageous to a consumer to use a credit card (consumer protection, points, etc).
That said, there are definitely marketplaces were bitcoin usage is active and growing. Darknets have always been a big use case. The bitcoin gambling scene is growing quickly. Remittances is growing. The Cannabis industry is starting to look into bitcoin. The gaming industry will see a big uptick in bitcoin and Counterparty usage in 2017.
There are actual use cases for bitcoin outside of speculation and at the moment it's mostly for regulatory arbitrage and the underserved.
Edit: Also, after perusing your site, I don't even see Bitcoin shown as a payment method under the 'Buy' button for the listings, so I'm not surprised you're not getting any bitcoin transactions since you don't even show that it's accepted.

I wouldn't use it, they have a history of bugs and people losing their bitcoins from their wallet. Also, it's a web wallet so if their servers go down for whatever reason then you don't have immediate access to your coins.

Being a part of Bitcoin is about taking control and responsibility for your money, and that includes making financial decisions for yourself.
We don't know what the future will be but a lot of people around here believe that bitcoin will be successful long term and be worth significantly more than it is today. So I guess you need to ask yourself if you believe in the long term success of bitcoin and do a little more research.

There's a whole financial industry around trying to predict markets for all sorts of things like stocks, commodities, and currencies for that matter. 
It's similar in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with a bunch of people trying to predict price movements based on technical and fundamental analysis. You can check the daily discussions in for a taste of this, but most people there aren't very good at getting things right.

There is a hard fork happening tomorrow that will create a new altcoin based on Bitcoin's transaction history but will be it's own chain moving forward.

Honestly, Coinbase works fine as long as you're not doing anything shady and you're ok with paying taxes on any earnings you make from selling. I've been using them for over three years and never had a single problem.
As long as you go through the identity verification process and you're ok with them sharing your buying/selling info with the government, then it works great... but obviously, if you're looking for privacy/anonymity then it's not for you.

Anyone can setup a bitcoin wallet and send/receive bitcoins without permission. Here's a few options for you to check out and try for yourself:

Of course getting bitcoins is a bit more work and buying them from some exchanges may require you to be over 18 for that, but there's other ways of getting bitcoin so you may have to do some more research for that.

Different wallets and services use different ways to access them. You seem to be under the impression that bitcoin is some singular centralized entity - it's not!
Think of it like email; you can't use a Gmail username to access an AOL email account even though they use the same email protocol.
You really need to figure out where you put your bitcoins or what service/website/wallet/exchange you used before we can help you any further. Perhaps ask your friend if he/she remembers.
@_date: 2016-12-08 08:21:47
Because it's too risky for the sellers since Paypal has a history of reversing transactions in favor of the buyer. And since bitcoin transactions are irreversible, it can be easy for a buyer to do a chargeback AND make off with the bitcoins.
That said, [Localbitcoins.com]( and [Paxful.com]( do have a good number of people trading with Paypal but they charge a much higher premium on the price of bitcoin to compensate for the risk taken.

You can transfer the coins to any wallet you want but you won't necessarily be anonymous since they can just track your transactions from Coinbase. If you wanted anonymity, you should have bought through an anonymous service.
That said, there are ways to make those coins more anonymous via tumblers or even transfering them to/from an anon coin like Monero, but it can be a bit complicated.
Regardless, the first thing you need to do is get your coins off of Coinbase and into a wallet you control the keys to.

Trying to time the market is a fool's errand and you'll just end up driving yourself nuts with anxiety watching the price all the time wondering when you should get in. 
The best strategy would be a simple dollar cost averaging, where you put in a fixed amount each week or month over time regardless of price.
Consider this, I bought my first bitcoin during the last bubble in 2013 at around $980, and kept buying all the way down to the low 200s and then back up again to where we are now. Today my gains are at 130% with an average cost per bitcoin of around $390ish.

Coinbase charges a 1.5% fee for ACH transfers which is really not that bad for the convenience and ease of use, and it's much much cheaper than going though something like Localbitcoins or a Bitcoin ATM.

That said, many people here are in it for the long term and believe the price will be significantly higher over many years from now despite any short term drops and volatility.

* Can you ride out short term volatility swings without panic selling?
* Can you afford to lose everything you invest in bitcoin?

Almost all cloud mining operations are scams and the ones that are maybe legit aren't really that profitable, you usually end up losing money compared to what you could have earned from just holding bitcoins.
The best bitcoin investment is to simply buy bitcoin outright and keep it safe and secure in a wallet you control while you sit back and watch as the price hopefully rises over the long term.

This could actually be a good thing, since if you buy bitcoin from them then immediately transfer to your own wallet, then there wouldn't be any taxes to pay since the price would be close to what you bought at. And if the IRS accepts this and it's a done deal, then future gains on those coins go tax free.
If anything, this just supports the long-standing sentiment of never keeping your coins on an exchange.

While we do depend on miners to process transactions and secure the network, they don't have access to our funds the same way that a bank would. For example, a miner cannot just confiscate or block a Bitcoin user from access to their funds. The idea is the incentive structure in place in the code is enough to keep people mining.
The way I see it is, Bitcoin is simply cash for the Internet. It's not perfect and not well suited for many types of transactions at the moment, but it does have it's use cases and strong points.
@_date: 2016-12-09 18:41:01


Don't buy mining contracts for cloud mining, they're almost always either a straight up scam or if they are legit it's almost never profitable.
If you're interested in mining yourself, then check out lots of good info in the sidebar. I won't stop you from trying but you'll probably soon realize that unless you have the funds to invest in specific mining hardware, have free or cheap electricity, and the technical expertise to do so, then mining will not be a profitable endeavor.
If you're looking to make money in this space then the best way is to just buy bitcoin outright and keep them safe and secure in a wallet you control and watch as the price hopefully appreciates over time.
That said, since you're new, before you even think about getting into mining, you'll at least need to know a little more about bitcoin and how it works. A good place to start your research is the newcomers thread and FAQ here:

If you truly believe this, wouldn't it make sense to sell now while the price is reasonably high and switch to whatever your next preferred altcoin while I presume the price of that altcoin is reasonably low? 
Also, if you are so dissatisfied with the miners, the people who invest massive amounts of capital to create the most secure system in the world, would it not make sense to sell now and move to a PoS system like Peercoin or NXT so as to avoid the supposed issues you're concerned about?


I'm pretty sure the early inventors like Satoshi foresaw specialized mining hardware in the future and a consolidation of mining. I don't think anyone was under the delusion that CPU and GPU mining would last forever. That said, since you're so angry at the direction of bitcoin, might I recommend you move everything into Monero since that has adaptive blocksizes and CPU/GPU mining, and the added bonus of fungibility... worth considering :)

He does hit some but the timing and conditions are typically off when he does get it right, but this guy is making a tremendous amount of predictions in his reports and most of them are usually completely wrong. And some of his stuff is really wackado things, for example, we were supposed to have an alien space cruiser circle the globe not too long ago; he also predicted the world would end in 2012 and that hasn't happened yet either.
His gold and silver predictions have been consistently wrong for years.
Getting the presidential pick right isn't really that impressive given it was basically a 50/50 chance... now had he said Gary Johnson or Jill Stein would win and they did, now that'd be impressive.
Also, his Bitcoin predictions aren't that impressive either, he usually just says it will go over some number and shoot up, bla, bla, bla... this isn't really anymore accurate than what the TA folks predict with their charting and what not. Not that I don't want his bitcoin predictions to come true, I always root for a price increase, but he hasn't been as accurate as people claim, no one ever talks about all the stuff he gets wrong.
The guy is a modern day Nostradamus, throw enough shit against the wall and eventually something will stick.

Yes, the 128GB wouldn't last much longer which is why I went with a 256GB flash drive which is bit more expensive unfortunately. That said, you could always enable pruning once the full blockchain is downloaded and that will free up a lot of space making the 128GB last longer.

While there are certainly hoarders and speculators, I'd argue that is an important part of the price discovery process and what gives any money the needed value in the first place:
That said, it's a bit of a myth that bitcoin isn't being used for anything, it is, although not in a traditional way. It tends to get used for regulatory arbitrage, darknet markets, gambling, capital flight, etc. In addition to the perceived illicit activities, we're also see increasing usage in legit areas like gaming markets and remittances.
It's not a perfect currency by any means, especially if you live in a first world country with modern banking services and an already existing stable currency; but it is getting better, more stable over time, more infrastructure being built out, more use cases, increasing network effect, etc.

When BCH originally hard forked away from Bitcoin they changed the difficulty adjustment algorithm to avoid a situation where their blockchain might stall out and stop producing blocks due to the shared hashing algo with Bitcoin; however this had an unintended consequence that let miners produce blocks on the BCH chain very rapidly, every few seconds, instead of the 10 minute average like it should have. By the time they fixed it, with yet another hard fork, their chain was approximately a months worth of blocks ahead of Bitcoin.

This assumes those alts will have a significant rise against BTC in the future which is possible but certainly woudn't take it for certain, especially with that group of coins.
I had a similar strategy when I dabbled with alts back in 2013-2014; I held NXT, Peercoin, and Doge - all were in the top 5 at one point and none of them ever got back to their high ratio to BTC again. Fortunately, I only had small portions in those and kept most in BTC which proved to be the winning move in the long run.

I assume you don't have any bitcoin or a bitcoin wallet to begin with, so that's the first step. Since you're not in this for the long run and just need to pay someone, the easiest way would be to use either the [Cashapp]( or [Coinbase]( both of which allow you to buy bitcoin and then send it from their integrated wallets.
Once you have the bitcoin in your wallet, just hit the 'send' button and either scan the payment QR code or paste the address you want to send it to, and click send, that's it.

The electricity used in the infrastructure of the current financial sector wastes far more electricity. In addition, I believe a disinflationary currency like Bitcoin would lead to a more sustainable economy with a focus on more durable goods than disposable ones since inflationary currencies promote increased consumption and waste of both natural resources and the energy/electricity to produce them. 
So yes, I do have a different opinion on the matter, one that I've put a lot of thought into and continue to research and study. I could be wrong and am open to rational civilized discussion, but not so much hyperbolic rants.

Yes, it could be a good idea to hold on to your bitcoins as there are a lot of people around that think the price will continue it's run up over the next year. [Here's one such article]( but of course, nothing is guaranteed.
As for using Gemini, it's a legit exchange for buying and selling bitcoin, although you might run into issues if they suspect the bitcoin came from a gambling site but you might need to look into that more.
If you're going to hold on to the bitcoins though then you should keep them in your own wallet that you control and not on an exchange. Exchanges aren't meant for long term storage.
Check out the following wallets to move your bitcoins to:
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)
* [Breadwallet]( (iPhone or Android)
* [Mycelium]( (Android)
* [Bitpay wallet]( (all devices)
* [Jaxx]( (all devices)
* [Electrum]( (Desktop)
* [Trezor]( (Hardware)
* [Ledger Nano S]( (Hardware)
Just make sure you follow the appropriate backup procedures for whatever wallet you choose.

For the most part Bitcoin is meant to use the Internet as a backbone so if that's not available then yes it's going to be difficult to use it and cash would be better in those very particular circumstances. Bitcoin and cash are not mutually exclusive, both can exist and each have their strengths and weaknesses.
How about this as an alternate example, what if a child wanted to start an online business that accepts payments from around the globe, how would they do that? Certainly cash doesn't work for them. Even other payment services like credit card or paypal or square wouldn't work since a child wouldn't be old enough to signup for those. In this instance, Bitcoin would be a good option.
@_date: 2019-08-12 20:19:14
The exchanges you buy from have their own built-in wallets which you could keep your bitcoin there if you wanted to, although it is often recommended that you eventually move/store your bitcoin in wallet you control the keys to and not with an exchange where you don't control the keys.

For the record, this is not an endorsement of Bitpay, still not a fan, but thought this was newsworthy and a step in the right direction for a company that's been dragging its feet on upgrading its services to the latest Bitcoin technology - hopefully they can be encouraged to keep moving in this right direction of supporting segwit in its services.

Are you sure it will drop again, this could just be the beginning of the next bubble and we're at the bottom. If you look at the last three bubbles, the price usually fell down to just above the previous high. So if you apply that to now then we're at the bottom. Of course, this assumes that the pattern repeats and past events don't always dictate the future.
I'd suggest reading through this recent article by Vinny Lingham for further research information on possible market action:

Consider the loss as a tuition payment for a valuable lesson on not trusting other people with your money, especially ones that make claims of giving you abnormally high returns without any evidence of how they are able to pay it. Next time you'll hopefully be more careful with your bitcoins.
Also, begging for bitcoin is against the rules here.
@_date: 2016-11-10 07:13:27
I bought my first small amount of bitcoin during the 2013 bubble at around a price of $900ish... since then I've periodically put in small amounts every month or so and my portfolio has seen a significant return over the years, more than doubling my cost of bitcoin invested, outperforming a majority of other assets in that time.
That anecdote aside, Bitcoin is still young, experimental, and risky; and if you believe in the success of Bitcoin long term then just have some patience, keep hodling, and don't freak out over sharp up and down swings. If you're just here to gamble and make a quick buck then you'll likely lose not only your bits but your mind from the anxiety of constantly watching the price.
As usual, don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

I assume you are talking about Blockchain.info and NOT Blockchain.io which doesn't exist.
That said, Blockchain.info wallet has a history of bugs and people losing their bitcoins from their service. In addition, it's a web wallet so if their servers go down for whatever reason, then you can't access your bitcoins.
And as Dougsrib said in the other comment, there are MUCH better wallets available now in terms of both usability and security. My personal favorite that I highly recommend is [Airbitz](

This is really standard since it's an ACH transfer which tend to take 3-5 business days. The problem isn't really Coinbase or Bitcoin, it's the legacy banking system that is holding things up. And for Coinbase's own protection, they need to wait until the ACH transfer clears until they can release the bitcoins to you.
@_date: 2016-12-28 22:30:40
Basically they give you a routing number and account number that's similar to what you'd get from your bank for a checking or savings account, then you just use those on your direct deposit form that your employer gives you, then when you get paid it goes to Bitwage where they convert to Bitcoin and send it to you.

Yep, that's definitely a good strategy, I do the same thing myself, just buying a little each month and slowly building up my bitcoin balance, which has also gained in significant value over the past three years as well.

Honestly, I've been doing 1-2 sat/byte for most of the last year and usually get confirmed within several blocks if not the next one. Despite what other communities say to demonize Bitcoin, the fees really are cheap, and if you use Segwit even cheaper.

If it were possible for anyone to actually find a private key with funds in it on that site then the whole Bitcoin protocol would be comprised and rendered completely useless.
For an exercise I recommend going through the site listings yourself and see if you can find any addresses that currently have funds in them in which case you could easily swipe for yourself. Report back when you manage to swipe some.

It does use bigger blocks, Segwit makes the blocks bigger and it's been helping to keep the mempool cleared out for quite some time now.
I regularly send transactions for 1-2 sats/byte and they get through usually in a few blocks no problem.
Big blocks isn't the issue, but if you want big blocks for whatever reason then there's more than enough options for you to choose from via different chains.

bits is already used as a unit for 1 millionth of a bitcoin and it didn't really take off to begin with.
satoshis or sats is perfectly fine and seems to be getting more and more traction as one of the main bitcoin units.
sat or sats is a one syllable word and it has a nice history to it, honors the creator of bitcoin, is unique, and is the native unit of the lightning network.
1,000 sats is preferable way to say it, no need to try to confuse everyone.
Not to mention the recent news that the Oxford English Dictionary has recently listed 'satoshi' as being the smallest unit of a bitcoin.

Opps, sorry about that.
That said, there are some miners who mine empty blocks every once in awhile but it's really in their best interest to process transactions, otherwise the price of Bitcoin will plummet and their investment into their mining operation will be worthless.
I don't know technical details of hardforks that well but I don't believe they could kill the mainchain as long as there are some miners still on the main fork, so I think it'd have to be a pretty serious effort in collusion on the miners part to make that happen, which I see as pretty unlikely. 
In addition, going against the users would not be in their interest because if miners are showing bad intentions then everyone would dump their coins and the price would crash, thus putting them out of business.
@_date: 2016-12-19 18:51:05
Excellent FAQ, very informative. 
Something I keep seeing posted and would like to see a good answer to is the statement that LN is not censorship resistant - could someone expand on why that is or is not the case and if it even matters?
@_date: 2016-12-26 17:16:15
It's probably still many years away for brick and mortars and they'll probably be the last hold outs since Bitcoin is better suited for Internet payments. In addition, brick and mortars will need LN developed first in order to facilitate instant transactions as opposed to 10+ minutes to wait for a confirmation.
@_date: 2019-08-14 21:21:26
There's definitely some people/services that are WAYYY over paying on fees for some reason. You can often get into the next few blocks for as little as 1-2 sats/byte; and even if you want to make sure priority transaction in the next block then not more than 20 sats/byte will usually do it.
By the way, I use this site a lot for checking mempool and fees:
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:09:16
That's why you gotta hold for longer time period; while you might have mad a small profit, that'll probably be next to nothing once you account for short term capital gains taxes.

I think the reason you're getting snarky dickish responses is because you didn't really ask how it works, but seemed to arrogantly assume that you should somehow be making money just for buying.
To answer, there's no guarantee that you'll make money in terms of the dollar value of the bitcoin you hold. The price of bitcoin fluctuates constantly which means the dollar value of your bitcoin will also fluctuate similar to if you own stocks or gold or any other asset.
That said, a lot of people around here believe in Bitcoin's long term potential as a store of value and that it will be much higher over the long term, over many years, even if the value may go down over the short term.

I don't recommend buying through RobinHood since they don't allow you to transfer your bitcoin out to your own wallet, they hold the keys and they don't let you do anything with them, which defeats the point of owning bitcoin in the first place.

Yes, the following wallets are all very good and allow you to control your own private keys without downloading the full blockchain:
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)

* [Bitpay wallet]( (all devices)
* [Jaxx]( (all devices)
* [Electrum]( (Desktop)

You don't need to store your bitcoin in the core wallet in order to get the security benefits of it. You can simply use a wallet that lets you connect to your full node in order to validate your own transactions.

LOL WTF, these guys don't even know what a fucking blockchain is!
Not being able to break into a Salesforce server doesn't say anything about how good their forcecoin blockchain is, unless they think that a database on their server IS a blockchain... this is just ridiculous. Also, not to mention, not breaking into some random companies server, doesn't in any way invadidate the Bitcoin blockchain as the most secure trusted system.... this HAS to be satire.

Trying to time the market is a fool's errand and you'll just end up driving yourself nuts with anxiety watching the price all the time wondering when you should get in. 
The best strategy would be a simple dollar cost averaging, where you put in a fixed amount each week or month over time regardless of price.
Consider this, I bought my first bitcoin during the last bubble in 2013 at around $980, and kept buying all the way down to the low 200s and then back up again to where we are now. Today my gains are at 130% with an average cost per bitcoin of around $390ish.

If this is true, which seems a bit strange, it could actually be advantageous assuming people don't hold their bitcoin in Coinbase, which they shouldn't.

Mining is legal in the U.S. and wouldn't fall under money laundering unless you were actually laundering money... and since mining is simply creating bitcoin from electricity I don't see a problem there. As for taxes, sales of bitcoin is treated as capital gains similar to sale of other commodities.
@_date: 2019-08-09 22:09:48
One of the big criticisms of Bitcoin is that it's not "stable" so if it stuck at $12k then that'd no longer be an argument against bitcoin, although personally I don't even think it's a good argument to begin with. Regardless, being stuck at one price for too long is unlikely to happen.

Trying to figure out when a correction will happen is a fools errand. It could happen and probably will at some point, but the question is by how much and whether the dip is lower or higher than current price.
If you believe in Bitcoin's long term prospects then it really doesn't matter, just buy and hodl on for the long term regardless of volatility.
If you're just here to gamble on short term price swings then just leave now because you'll most likely end up getting rekt trying to pick price moves.

Coinbase is legit and fine to buy bitcoins from. Coinbase also is a wallet which you could store your bitcoin but it is generally not recommended since they have control of the keys. The Blockchain.info wallet is slightly better but also not recommended since they have had a lot of security issues in the past.
Here's a few good wallets that let you control your private keys:
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)
* [Breadwallet]( (iPhone or Android)
* [Mycelium]( (Android)
* [Jaxx]( (all devices)

Yes, you're describing trading, and you could possibly do what you say in your example but the problem is actually knowing which way the market is going to move - timing the market, especially Bitcoin, is a lot more difficult than you might realize.
As far as getting liquidated, that'd only happen if you were using leverage. If you're just trading your own money then the most you could lose is whatever you put in.

The problem is you're fixated with the price, yet fail to recognize the massive amount of development work happening right now that is actively building out the second layers of Bitcoin.
I recall a similar sentiment from many people in the long bear market in 2014 - 2015, and a lot of people left the community because they weren't "getting rich quick", which is good, because we don't want those kinds of fickle investors in the community. The people who are in it for the tech and the philosophy of censorship resistant currency are the ones did and will make out in the end.
@_date: 2019-02-01 17:25:37
The main selling point of using Bitcoin is for censorship resistance.
Paypal is notorious for shutting people down for doing things that don't like, often times locking up peoples' money for long periods of time or outright confiscating it. In addition, it only works for people who already have access to banking infrastructure, and even then you can't use it for stuff they may disagree with.
In third world countries like Venezuela for instance, your wealth can easily be taken away either from government or through hyper-inflation, so it's important to store your wealth in something that is censorship resistant, aka Bitcoin.


You're likely saying this from the comfort of a 1st world nation with a relatively stable currency, but that is not the case with all fiat in all countries.

Any news site is always going to be behind the market, you'd need to be paying attention to the original sources, this means following all the top people/companies in Bitcoin on Twitter and if you're trying to trade off of technical announcements then that means paying attention to the dev newsletters, which is where the original cancellation announcement was made.

Yes it's basically a new account/wallet. There is [no fee for transferring between Changetip accounts]( Transfers between Changetip accounts is what is considered an "offchain" transaction, however if you were to send bitcoin to or from Changetip with another wallet then there would be a small fee that goes to the miners which is typically only around 3 cents or less.
Different wallets provide other additional services in order to help support them, some just rely on donations, etc.

The origin goes back to before Bcash split off from Bitcoin and the community was heavily debating scaling. At the time was pretty much empty and the owner/mod of it being a big block supporter gave (allegedly sold it) to Roger Ver to promote the big block agenda, although their main reasons/talking points for doing so was because of complaints about censorship in r/bitcoin. 
Of course when the split happened and the big block chain got a different ticker symbol, originally BCC, then BCH, it stopped making sense to use but it's still there mainly to confuse the fuck out of people, especially noobs into buying BCH.

Sort of, it's possible to search the blockchain for all addresses with 21 or more but probably wouldn't be a good indicator of wallets or actual people that own 21 Bitcoin. 
For example, some wallets could contain many addresses with amounts smaller than 21 but add up to more than that. In addition, big exchange addresses could contain the holdings of thousands of different people. Also, there are people that have lost the private keys to their coins and don't have access to them. So it's kind of hard to tell how many people are *actually* in the club.
That said, here's a site that lists addresses by highest amounts of bitcoin:

It would be difficult dealing in the current unit of 1 Bitcoin if the price continues to increase since that means people will need to deal with fractions and decimals for daily commerce. However, since Bitcoin is divisible by 8 decimals, it is more likely that a smaller unit would be adopted, thus shifting the decimal place to the right a few notches so that people are dealing in whole numbers. 
For example, the six decimal place over or 1 millionth of a Bitcoin is commonly referred to as a "bit". If the bit unit is adopted then when 1 Bitcoin = 1 million USD, then the 1 bit unit would equal 1 USD and be in parity, but the point is you'd be dealing in whole numbers rather than fractions which is much easier.
Regardless, any further moves upward in price and eventually stabilization as the market cap increases will lead to people adopting different units to the right of the decimal place. Also, if Bitcoin does start become more widely adopted people will simply learn to associate how much something in Bitcoin or bits or satoshis is valued at the same way you learn the value of any other currency.

This is still a lot of people unbanked, and that's just adults; consider that most people under age 18 have no access to banking and thus in order to make online payments need to resort to things like gift cards or cryptocurrencies.
Also, we need to consider that all banking services are not equal. Banking services in the U.S. are much better than in places like India, where many people will have a bank account, but they're not used as frequently (compared to cash) and tend to have poor service.

Yea, unless you did the encrypted backup phrase that the wallet offers and [recommends in its safety advisory]( then it's lost. I suppose consider it a learning experience. It's always easy to procrastinate on backing things up until an accident happens of course and then it's too late. Personally, I always make sure to not only write down the backup information for any new wallet I create, but also test it out to make it works and I know how to recover it in the future. Fortunately, fifty bucks isn't a huge amount, but it still sucks. Sorry man.

Well when people say that, they are referring to who is in control of the private keys of the coins. If you keep them on the Coinbase wallet then they control the private keys even though you can still move/spend/hold them. It's a matter of trusting Coinbase, similar to how you'd trust a bank with your fiat money. Some people fear that Coinbase could possibly confiscate or lock down funds for whatever reasons.
That said, what most people do is buy from Coinbase then move them to a wallet where you control the keys which is probably the best option.

[Circle.com]( allows you to buy with a Visa credit card.
As far as wallets go, I'd recommend the following:
* [Mycelium]( for Android
* [Bread Wallet]( for iPhone
* [Copay]( for either Android or iPhone or Windows
* [Airbitz]( for Android or iPhone
Technically, Circle also acts as a wallet as well, but for security reasons you'll only want to use them to buy Bitcoin, then transfer to a wallet of your choice that you control. All of the above are good for small amounts. Also, whichever wallet you choose, make sure you follow the appropriate backup instructions so that you don't accidentally lose anything.
Here's a few bits to get you started :) 5000 bits
@_date: 2015-08-12 18:10:35
No problem. I send bits from one of my other wallets to Changetip where I keep a balance to use for tipping people on social media. When I tip you in a comment, then Changetip recognizes that and makes the transfer between Changetip accounts.
Keep in mind that Changetip is simply another type of Bitcoin wallet that lets you store, send, and receive Bitcoin, except that Changetip has the unique function of allowing people to send and receive Bitcoin via social media sites like Reddit, Youtube, and Twitter for example. 
So you can either store that 1000 bits in Changetip, tip it out to someone else, or send it to another one of your wallets. Hope that explains it :)

For those that think Macs are immune from malware and viruses, this should be a wake up call, especially if you're into Bitcoin and crypto.
Some things to help protect yourself based on the threats from the article:
* Install [Malwarebytes]( keep it updated, and periodically scan your machine. They do a good job of keeping updated with latest malware and track a lot of crypto related malware, including the OSX.DarthMiner malware variations mentioned in this article.
* Use two-factor authentication for your exchange accounts
* Don't store your passwords in the browser password manager, use a secure password manager
* Don't keep your coins on an exchange. Get a hardware wallet and use that or another secure cold storage solution for large amounts of bitcoin.
* Use Firefox browser instead of Chrome or Safari; and install Ublock Origin, Privacy Badger, and HTTPS Everywhere extensions.
* Periodically clear your cookies from your browser settings.
* Practice safe computing, don't download and install random sketchy programs.
@_date: 2015-08-12 17:28:20
Well [Circle.com]( is the easiest to buy with a credit card, but I believe it does require some level of verification, although it is pretty quick to setup if that is your concern. You could also check out [LibertyX]( which would allow you to change cash for Bitcoin at a physical store location.

My view is that the upside potential is far greater than the downside risk.

There's time/labor costs with accepting cash. If you ever stay at a bar til closing time you'll notice the bartenders have to count up all the cash, double and triple check it to make sure it matches the cash receipts, record it in the ledger, then it needs to go to the bank for deposit. These things are basically automatic with credit cards.

It's really in the best interest of an exchange to not cause confusion especially between two coins in which users can accidentally send coin to the wrong chain, thus causing a lot of extra cost and work for the exchange to try to retrieve coins on the other chain for the customer.

That hypothesis doesn't really hold any weight if you look at the previous two halvings in which price went up, by quite a lot, after each of the last two halvings. There may not be as much hype, but there's also way less new supply of Bitcoin, so the same or slightly lower than normal demand would cause price to go up.

Was it a BCH address you sent it to? If so, you'd need to be able to access the private keys of that same address on the BTC chain to get your coins back, so if you sent them to a BCH wallet you control then it's possible to export the private keys to a BTC wallet and get them, or if you sent them to an exchange's BCH address then you need to ask them if they can get it for you which some of them do.

Decreasing mining difficulty doesn't increase number of coins, the algorithm adjusts so we find a block on average every 10 minutes regardless of difficulty; that's how it works with Bitcoin anyways.

As other commentors are mentioning, it would be quite difficult to mistype and send to a working address due to the built in check sum. Are you sure you didn't simply send two payments to the person you were supposed to? Which wallet was the recipient using? If it was an HD wallet then it would automatically generate new receiving address when a transaction is detected, which could possibly lead someone to believe they sent to a wrong address.

One of the whole points of Bitcoin is that you control your own money without any third parties involved, so if you leave your money on an exchange like Coinbase then you are trusting them with your money and it's really no different than the current banking system.
The Blockchain.info wallet is slightly better than coinbase, but still that is not a recommended wallet since it's a web wallet and they have a history of being unreliable. I'd recommend either of the following wallets:
* [Airbitz]( iPhone or Android
* [Breadwallet]( iPhone or Android

Depending on the wallet the other person was using the transaction might not appear right away, in addition if there was a backlog in the mempool then confirmation could take some time.

Approximately every 10 minutes a new block is mined and these are what processes bitcoin transactions. The people who mine these blocks (miners) receive 12.5 bitcoin as a reward if they're the first to mine a block. When the halving happens this means that the block reward will be reduced by half or 6.25 bitcoin per block.

Energy use itself is not a bad thing, it's a sign of an advanced civilization, otherwise if you did think it was bad then you should give up all electronics and live in an Amish style community.
It's where and how the energy is produced that matters, and since Bitcoin has become a sort of subsidy to renewable energy producers, it makes that type of production more profitable and more likely to get built out, thus putting us on that path sooner. So Bitcoin is actually helping us toward a more sustainable future.

Not familiar with that wallet but if it relies on central servers then it could be having similar [problems to what Mycelium has been experiencing]( in that the huge amount of spam transactions has caused those servers to go down.

It seems like a bad idea since you shouldn't be giving random sites your private keys and you have to trust that these services will still be around at the time you want to get your keys - there's a lot of trust in a third party here which is kind of the antithesis of Bitcoin.
Rather than going through this complicated risky mess, just get hardware wallet like a Trezor or Ledger, put your bitcoin on it and stowe it away for awhile.
In addition, you might want to consider the underlying problem of WHY you have weak hands; could it be that you are investing more than you can afford to lose? Something to consider.

Out of curiosity, what if I have multiple contactless cards in my wallet? Do they all get charged or just one at random?
@_date: 2017-04-14 17:09:45
I think this is a terrible idea. You're essentially using a loan to gamble with. Let me ask you this, if bitcoin crashes to zero and you lose it all will it have a negative impact on your life?
@_date: 2016-02-11 17:58:24
Due to AML and KYC laws you aren't really going to find any that will take a prepaid with no ID. The only loophole to this I know, is buying through [Purse.io]( but you'll pay a high premium on the price of Bitcoin. If you're trying to be anonymous then you should just pay cash using [Localbitcoins.com](

No the listed wallets are mostly just for storing, sending, and receiving Bitcoin. It sounds like you are more interested in a place to buy Bitcoin anonymously than simply having a private wallet? The easiest places to buy are Coinbase and Circle but those require personal information to comply with AML and KYC laws unfortunately. Your best bet is to go through either [LocalBitcoins.com]( or the Mycelium local trader function.

Sure, if you believe that Bitcoin will continue to grow in the future then the  price seems very reasonable right now as there has been consistent support around the 220ish level. Of course, no one really knows, it's still a risky investment, but just looking at the expansion of the infrastructure and investments into Bitcoin related companies, it seems reasonable that it will increase in value over the long term - short term they will likely continue to be volatile and choppy.

I get the sentiment but just looking at it from a technical point of view, Bitcoin or any alt isn't even close to being ready for mainstream, so any type of financial disaster will probably just mean Bitcoin crumbles under it's own scaling limits.

I suspect they were probably using Bitpay which no doubt was charging for the merchant service, in addition to them not being compatible with many bitcoin wallets, then it's not surprising they dropped it.

We don't really know since there aren't many past examples of Bitcoin's price behavior in war scenarios, but we have seen some short-term increases during financial distress events such as the Cyprus bail-in, Greece crisis, and Brexit; but that was most likely due to speculation and not so much people in those specific countries buying/using more Bitcoin.

Not exactly sure what you mean by 'pegged' since altcoins trade freely against Bitcoin, although it is true that in many cases you do need to buy Bitcoin first in order to get into an alt but I wouldn't call that a peg, not like the proposed sidechain pegs at least.
Also, it may not always be the case that Bitcoin is required before exchanging to an alt as there have been rumors of exchanges and brokers adding some of the other top alts which means the ability to buy directly with fiat.
In addition, [this article]( points out why it's probably better that alt coins aren't pegged to Bitcoin.

One of the reasons I stopped using and recommending their wallet, they really moved into a gray shady/scammy area and it looks like they're not doing much with the funds raised nor do I think anyone who bought those tokens will get their money back.

The financial incentive isn't there to pull this off since if you did brute force an address then the Bitcoin price would collapse since it'd be compromised and any further brute forcing would be pointless because the bitcoins wouldn't be worth anything, thus it doesn't make sense to put the resources to work for the reward of one address, you'd get more reward from just mining bitcoin.

No one can tell you for sure whether it's going up or down especially in the short term and if you obsess on price and try timing the market you're going to drive yourself nuts with anxiety. If you want to invest in Bitcoin, then do it for the long term, over years, in which case short term fluctuations won't matter, since if Bitcoin becomes successful then the price will have to be significantly higher than it is now.
If you believe in Bitcoin's long term potential, just invest now, hold for the long term, and don't panic over the daily price swings. Also, don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

Not surprised, those cloud mining sites never have good reputations and are almost always scams. Just a quick Google search brought up some suspect information on them:
When dealing with an irreversible unregulated currency, personal responsibility becomes much more important and a heck of a lot of due diligence and skepticism should be considered before lending out your precious Bitcoin. You know that old saying, if it sounds too good to be true...

Electrum is an HD wallet which means it provides a new receiving/public address each time one is used. The reason for this is to help with privacy since you shouldn't be reusing the same address each time anyways. That said, all addresses remain valid so any funds sent to any address created from your wallet will be received.

It's much easier today to buy Bitcoin via many different outlets than it was several years ago and certainly easier than when it first started. Yes, getting people the ability to easily exchange their fiat for Bitcoin still has a lot of friction, but that is mainly due to the government. That said, the infrastructure continues to grow every year and more and more people are getting it and using it, it just takes some time for widespread distribution to occur.

In regards to Bitcoin's energy consumption, there's a lot of misinformation out there and a general lack of understanding about how energy grids and energy usage works; I'd argue Bitcoin has actually been helping to subsidize green energy development and usage and is not as environmentally detrimental as the environmental zealots would have you believe.

Both Localbitcoins and Paxful are peer to peer services and there are options from buying locally or remotely. I'd recommend going to the help section and reading through the documents:
* 
*

It's possible you could send the bitcoins from either of these services directly to the merchant but it's not really good practice - you should ideally have your own wallet that you control; then buy bitcoins, send to your wallet, then send to the merchant.
I can't really hold your hand on this as I don't use DNMs and don't know how they work, so you'll have to continue to research it and figure it out.

With Coinbase you can increase your daily buy limits by doing various verifications, which shouldn't take much to get up to a few thousand. 8 Bitcoins will be around $3500 or so which shouldn't be too difficult to buy over the course of a few days using both Coinbase and Circle.

Censorship resistant refers to not having a counter party or some central authority like a bank or government from stopping you to make payments or storing value - Bitcoin allows you to use it without risk of these authorities censoring or confiscating your funds.
You could say that being able to send/receive money to whoever you want is a form of freedom of expression.
Edit - A great example of this is when WikiLeaks had all of their payment/donation methods shutdown from all the credit card and merchant processors. Had it not for them being able to accept payments and donations in Bitcoin they would not have been able to continue operating.

Of course I know that merchants get charged the fee and price it into the product/service, however, as you pointed out, most merchants charge the same price regardless of payment method used. Thus with that in mind and prices being the same, a rational consumer would use the method which gets them a discount in the form of cashback or other reward like a credit card over one that doesn't get them anything like cash.


You make assumptions about me being a fool, yet while you're paying cash for your shit, I'm using the banking system in my advantage earning thousands in cashback and rewards over those 15 years, which I've used some to buy Bitcoin getting a significant return of it in the meantime. 
Whether the merchant is paying a fee or not is inconsequential to me unless they actually offer a discounted price for cash payments which is almost never.
Perhaps you're the one being naive.

It's not difficult at all, you can buy low amounts of bitcoin from [Circle]( using a debit or credit card within minutes.
The problem here is that you're wanting to get bitcoin while avoiding giving id information using a notoriously bad payment service for sellers (paypal) and you're not taking into account how much of a risk this is for sellers since it's soooo easy for them to get scammed.
I understand your frustration but this is not Bitcoin's fault, it's a problem with the legacy payment network and an overbearing government which leaves us with two options for buying Bitcoin:
1) Quick and easy to get but intrusive in terms of identification
2) Private and anonymous but inefficient and burdensome to acquire
@_date: 2016-09-21 18:32:13
I don't know too much about faucets but your software is still brand new and it takes time to market and sell and all that other stuff. In addition, I believe FaucetBox already has a significant portion of the market covered and have been around longer so there's some heavy competition there.
If I were getting into this space, I'd focus on a product which is targeted towards online gaming, basically making it easy for gamedevs to integrate a faucet into their games.

Well LibertyX only charges a 1% fee, cheaper than Coinbase. 
Other than that, I don't know what to tell you, when you limit your options the costs tend to go up... nobody is going to go through the hassle of selling Bitcoin without making some money for their trouble, and the more inconvienent/risky for the seller, the higher the premium, it's basic economics.

As gaming continues to move towards cryptocurrency with things like Spells of Genesis and being able to buy games on Steam, we'll see more of this. I'd even venture to say that this will be the next big killer app for Bitcoin - digital blockchain gaming assets.

Big fan of this concept, a browser wallet plugin is perfect for doing LN micro-transactions on the web. Perhaps it could recognize whenever a LN request comes up, then you just hit a confirm button to pay instantly for something like a paywall or some such - way better user experience than having to pull out your phone, fiddling with it, and scanning a bar code.
Really love all the development going on with Lightning Network, these types of tools with good UI is what we'll need for adoption and true scaling.

While most exchanges require KYC info, Xapo is still particularly bad as wallet even if you don't buy from them. I had to use their wallet several years ago for some game faucet and forgot about it until recently when I realized there was a few hundred bucks in it and they still required a bunch of personal info like name, phone number, etc... like damn, fuck those guys... of course just the fact that they control the private keys is enough to avoid them in the first place.

Part of running a successful business is managing your cash flows, or in this case your Bitcoin flows. Not sure what you can do about it now but it'd make sense to me to charge higher prices for your "product" if it costs you more to procure the Bitcoin for your inventory, or even better try to convince your customers to pay you directly in Bitcoin (perhaps offer a discount for bitcoin payments), then keep a reserve of bitcoin for the purchase of future inventory.

The problem here isn't Bitcoin, it's that you're still dealing with the legacy banking system which you need to convert from fiat money to and from Bitcoin. Any business doing this is going to charge some kind of fee considering the inconvenience of having to deal with archaic technology. 
That said, once you're in the Bitcoin system, moving money around to other bitcoin addresses or even other crypto-currencies is much more frictionless and can be done for a very small cost of a few cents regardless of the amount.

First of all, there aren't any Libertarians even in office let alone making policy, so cut that shit out right now.
Second, if you actually did know about Libertarian views, you'd know they are against government being involved in the market and giving special favoritism to any particular company or industry; and thus they're also against crony capitalism.
Third, big government is what leads to crony capitalism - if you want less crony capitalism then you should also want less government which can be corrupted.
I think what you've done here is presented a dishonest portrayal of Libertarian views; and have really just attacked a strawman.

They've always done this for bank transfers and for good reason. It takes a bank transfer anywhere from 5-10 business days to settle and in order to protect themselves from scammers who may try to buy bitcoin, transfer it out and then stop the bank transfer, thus getting screwed out of money.

The idea behind simply buying and holding bitcoin is that hopefully the value in purchasing power increases over time. 
It is possible to make money with mining but it is quite difficult and requires technical knowledge, capital, and a source of cheap electricity; thus for most people, by the time they're ever able to recoup their costs of the mining setup, the price of bitcoin may go up and you'll have lost out on potential gains if you'd bought bitcoins outright in the first place.

Then if they send dollars which most clients will, convert that to Bitcoin, and if some of them send bitcoin directly, great!

Well I think those are the only options for debit/credit purchase in US. You'll probably have to try another way using cash. Perhaps the following:
* [LibertyX]( for cash
* [LocalBitcoins.com]( p2p trades
* [Bitsquare]( decentralized p2p trades
* [Any Bitcoin ATM]( for cash
Edit: There's a debit card option on [Paxful]( but you'll pay a higher premium for it.

Unless you have free/cheap electricity, lots of money to spend on mining specific hardware, and the tech knowledge to set it up and run it efficiently then no it's most likely not worth it to mine.
You'd be more likely to make money by simply buying bitcoin outright and keeping it safe and secure in a wallet you control while hopefully the value increases over time. Just don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

You usually need to go through some verification processes to increase your limits.

Did you send your bitcoins directly from Coinbase to any gambling, DNM sites, or other exchanges like Localbitcoins? If so, that could be the reason. If not, you could try contacting them as they seem to get false positives quite a bit.
That said, you shouldn't be using Coinbase as your main wallet considering they're obligated to track transactions for compliance reasons. If you're going to use them, you should *at least* just buy and then send them to a wallet where you control the private keys before using the bitcoins for anything.

This is one of the big problems with gold though, there isn't enough of it to be used as a physical currency, and even if you tried, it'd be quite difficult since the value/ounce would be so high you'd be paying for your groceries with a tiny sliver or smaller. So the only way to make it useful is to issue a token or pieces of paper redeemable for it by a third party, but of course that just puts us back into the problem of centralization and a path to fiat currency again. At least with Bitcoin it's divisible enough to accommodate everyone as to be useful.

Yes, and a lot of people here have attested that getting into Bitcoin has made them better savers. That said, Bitcoin is still considered a risky investment, albeit one with a huge potential returns in the future, so just don't put in more than you can afford to lose. Start small and learn how to use it and what it's about, then consider from there.
@_date: 2019-01-13 23:40:06
 is probably the easiest way. And as others have mentioned, you don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin, you can buy just a fraction of one. In fact, a Bitcoin is divisible by up to 100 million units; so it's possible to just buy a few dollars worth of Bitcoin if you wanted to.
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:52:22
Bitcoin definitely has it's shortcomings compared to centralized fiat currencies but that is at the cost of being decentralized and censorship resistant which I believe are the main selling points at the moment.

The fastest easiest way is to buy it from a service like [Cashapp]( then transfer it to your Electrum wallet.

When you refer to being a Bitcoin developer are you talking about contributing to the Core project or simply making applications that accept/use bitcoin?
Regardless, much of it will depend on your existing programming skill set. If you're already good programmer, particularly in C++, then you can go read the Core code and start contributing if you want. 
If you're just wanting to make apps then there's much less of a learning curve but you'd still need to know some kind of programming or app development of some kind; and learning that really just depends on how much time you're willing to devote to it.

You don't need smart contracts on a blockchain to automate these things though, it just makes them more inefficient.

Holders are what give it value in the first place, otherwise it'd be worthless to use as a currency. Store of value is required before it can be a medium of exchange.

Well I'm not sure how you determined that OP is lying or spreading FUD, I think his questions are reasonable for someone delving into bitcoin, after all, who amongst us wasn't skeptics at first.
I also disagree that following the price of something means you're well informed on it - I'm sure there are plenty of people in the world who watch prices but don't know that much about that thing. I think I'm a good example of this, when I first heard of bitcoin in 2011ish, I checked the price here and there just to see what it was doing but had no clue on how it worked or how to use it until I finally delved in in 2013ish... this is not unusual behavior in my opinion, and think you are being a bit paranoid by claiming that people asking questions about bitcoin is FUD when the reality is most likely they're skeptics doing a bit more research.

In regards to coding/programming, this is a field that is relatively easy for anyone to get into; it just requires a computer, Internet connection, and a little self discipline. There aren't any gender based limits, so if girls aren't interested in this field then I don't see that as an issue, people should be free to pursue the things they are interested in.

The way around this and still make Google and Apple happy is what SoG is doing, by allowing the purchase of special gems which will allow the player to summon rare or better in-game cards.
This is nice because you still use the Google and Apple payment mechanisms for in-game purchases, so they get their cut and are happy. The devs get the rest and make money so they're happy. And the users get more chances at the ability to create a maxed-out rare card which can then be turned into a blockchain game asset, then traded or sold, which means more money flowing into the crypto economy overall.

I'm not sure that I buy that women aren't encouraged into these fields at a younger age; these days girls are often encouraged and get far more attention in school than boys do and that is reflected in the increasing gender disparity of college/university enrollment.
That said, if this is such a concern to women then perhaps they should get to coding. There are some women in the Bitcoin community that do really great work and are well regarded - Elizabeth Stark is a great example of that, so it's not like there's some universal hate of women in the community, it's largely based off of merit which is the way it should be. Good code has no gender, it either works or it doesn't.


Like I said previously, there's nothing really stopping anyone from getting into coding, and using the excuse that you didn't get enough encouragement as a kid is just that, an excuse.

Because they're trying to push a particular narrative that "Core" devs control Bitcoin even though they don't, it's a very large group of people that contribute to the Core client from all different backgrounds, work for different companies, and some even work on it for free! There's far more contributors to the Core client than all of the devs on all of the BitcoinCash client teams put together. 
And that's not even mentioning that Bitcoin has many different clients/implementations other than core like BTCD, Knots, Bitcore as a few examples all with their own devs. 
Also, lets not forget that the UASF movement last spring went against the advice of many of the core devs and was largely a user based movement to get Segwit activated. 
To say that Bitcoin has centralized development I think is disengenous. However, whether it is or isn't is probably more subjective based on one's opinion. That said, BitcoinCash is farrr more centralized in terms of development that Bitcoin, their main reference client, BitcoinABC is basically under the control of one dev, Deadalinx or whatever the fuck his name is and has shown to make unilateral decisions for that chain without extensive community discussion.

Well, I'd say the first thing to do is to make sure your wallet is backed up properly just in case.
Second, try to verify whether you've actually received Bitcoin (BTC) or some other altcoin or fork like BitcoinCash (BCH) for example, as that would be a big difference in terms of value of the coins.
Then once you can verify what you actually have, then you can research some exchanges where to open an account and sell them if that's what you want to do.

Eh, I doubt it that's the reason. I think you're vastly over estimating the number of people in the crypto space that boycotted them because of B2X... there was and still is a HUGE market of idiots moving shitcoins around and that's Shapeshifts bread and butter.
Think about it; Bitcoin folks opposed to B2X are also likely to be Bitcoin maximalists and thus have no need to even use an exchange service like Shapeshift to begin with.
The main selling point of the Shapeshift service was as an anonymous exchange of coins, so I think the introduction of KYC is closer to the reason why they're struggling.

Cold storage simply means storing your private keys off-line, separate from an Internet connected device. This could be as simple as a paper wallet, or a hardware wallet, or a device not connected to the Internet.
If you had a laptop or some computer that doesn't touch the Internet with an Electrum wallet then yes that would be considered cold storage, however, you'd still want to make sure you write down and safely secure your seed words with pen and paper in the event of a hardware failure.

Is that the one re-named from raiblocks? It's a DAG coin, correct? If that's the case it suffers the fundamental problem of all DAG coins in that it requires a central coordinator or some such, so yea, you get fee-less and fast but sacrifice decentralization and censorship resistance.
By the way, once Lightning Network is in full-swing then Bitcoin will also have nearly fee free instant transactions and much more decentralized.

There have actually been quite a few people over the years who have lost money with Mycelium and we've seen many threads posted here, and it's usually due to their own neglect. 
The scenario is that they setup the wallet, put some Bitcoin in it, don't bother backing it up by simply writing down the 12 words despite that the wallet constantly reminds you to do this, then they either lose the phone or breaks and have no way to recover their funds because they failed to spend a few minutes writing down 12 words.

You can kind of predict technological improvements of a crypto if you pay attention to what the developers are working on. For example, when Litecoin was first setting up to upgrade to Segwit, I bought a bunch at $4 and then when Segwit activated on that coin the price shot way up. Another example, when the Monero devs were getting ready to release the GUI wallet, I bought a bunch at $3 and then the price shot way up when the wallet came out. Another example, as the Bitcoin block reward was coming close to the halving the price went way up. So there are predictable fundamentals in crypto if you can pay attention to and catch new developments.

Are you fucking kidding me, there is sooo much good tech and development on the horizon that will massively increase Bitcoin's utility value, just look at stuff like Lightining Network, Schnorr signatures, MAST, Mimblewimble, Zerolink/Tumblebit, etc etc.

Is there actually a dollar sign showing?
Here's what's happening, it's not showing you the dollar amount, it's showing you the BTC amount but in a smaller denomination, in this case it's showing you mBTC or milibits which would be 5.35612 mBTC. You can change the denomination it shows in the settings somewhere.

The article is simply shilling for DASH, but glosses over the fact that despite it's title, there is tons of consumer demand for bitcoin, it just so happens to be in areas that we like to ignore due to their perceived social immorality like drugs, gambling, prostitution, and capital controls evasion - non of which DASH has by the way.

Which forked bitcoins are you talking about, they've already distributed Bcash to people who had Bitcoin in their Bittrex account on August 1st.

The argument is that hashpower follows price rather than the other way around. Thus, if the legacy chain has a higher price then it's assumed that miners will eventually switch back to whatever is more profitable. We've already seen examples of this in action with the Bcash fork, miners tend to move to whatever is more profitable to them. Many people here believe there is more price support for the legacy chain than the proposed Segwit2x chain and why it will succeed in the long run.

Oh yea, why don't I just go ahead and send my IP to the guy giving no details and posts to @_date: 2017-09-02 16:23:21
It was never meant to change over night, the network needs a little time to start using segwit addresses which once we start seeing more wallets and exchanges using it then it'll help with the network.
That said, currently, the mempool is super low and it's possible to get through transactions for really cheap right now, so if you're seeing fees go up then you're probably using a shitty wallet; perhaps find a new wallet with better fee estimation or one that lets you enter custom fees.
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:25:55
Very cool, although one tip if you're not already doing it, but consider offering a hefty discount for people who pay in bitcoin over regular cash, otherwise people won't be motivated to part with a money that is rising in value versus one that is falling in value; and be sure to advertise that on your website!
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:03:53

First of all, China is cracking down on ICOs not Bitcoin. Second of all, even if they did shut down Bitmain, as long as you have the miner in your possession you can still mine bitcoin regardless of what China does, and them shutting down Bitmain, a highly profitable company, is unlikely in my opinion. Honestly, I wouldn't worry too much about China.

You need to ask yourself why you got into Bitcoin in the first place, was it just to make a quick buck gambling money you can't afford to lose on short term price swings? If so, then yes, get the fuck out before you get rekt.
Or perhaps you've thoroughly researched Bitcoin and the technology behind it; and believe in it's long term potential to disrupt the world economy, and if that's the case then you should just hold for the long term as the price will need to be much much higher in the future.

Who says they'd get away with it, Coinbase is licensed in the US and under US law, thus stealing people's money would be theft.
That said, exchanges have shut down before and been hacked in the past resulting in loss of bitcoin to users, which is why it is so often recommended that people don't leave their coins on an exchange but keep them in a wallet they control themselves.
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:53:27
The point being that centralized exchanges like Coinbase are storing your transaction information and able to link your identity with your coins and thus if the IRS want to go after you at some point in the future for tax evasion, it wouldn't be too hard for them to get that information.

It's simply a matter of exporting your BTC private keys from your wallet and importing them into a wallet for the forked coin. That said, there is a little more to it, you need to be careful in the process so as not to compromise your original coins, but that's the basic idea. Some wallets do however choose to implement tools to make it easier to split/move the forked coins though, for example, in the Bcash split both Ledger and Trezor were quick to release splitting tools, so it depends on your wallet and what their intents for each fork is.

* [GDAX](
* [Gemini](
* [Bitstamp](
* [Kraken](
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:59:05
No, it's just a different coin like Litecoin, DASH, Monero, or any other altcoin. The only difference is that BCH is a fork of BTC, so if you owned BTC in a wallet you controlled on August 1st then you also will have an equal number of BCH on that chain.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:39:05
Sounds like you had a paper wallet which would have both the public and private keys you need to access the Bitcoin, so definitely would want to find that paper. That said, it's hard to believe you were able to buy Bitcoin in 2010-2011 with a credit card since it was still in its infancy then and hardly any services existed then, and the ones that did are pretty much all out of business.
If you did buy with a credit card, then it may be worth it to look back through your transaction records during those years to find out which company you bought from; perhaps that will give you some clues as to where the coins are stored. Also, maybe search your email history for 'bitcoin' and maybe you'll find some more info that can help you out.

What do you mean you can't link your wallet? Coinbase has its own wallet built in which you can use to send/receive bitcoin from, so if bought bitcoin on Coinbase and wanted them in your Blockchain wallet then you'd just send them to that wallet.

You probably won't have to do anything since you don't control the private keys of your Coinbase wallet, they'll probably move the coins to Segwit addresses on the backend and new receiving addresses will likely be automatically generated to be Segwit compatible.

Least advanced in what regard? Most of the research and development of the most interesting crypto tech is happening in Bitcoin!

Sort of, but it's not in dollars. If you had 1 bitcoin (BTC) on August 1st then you will also have 1 BCH. The value of each coin in dollars will be different depending on the market rate for each coin.

So let me get this straight, you don't know what a blockchain is or what it does but you want to put your organization on one? Come on man, implementing things just for the sake of it is not a great way to go about running any kind of organization.
Blockchains are actually pretty terrible and inefficient for most use cases, in fact centralized databases are far more superior, blockchains just happen to be great for decentralized money though.
Ask yourself this, what problem are you trying to solve by using a blockchain? If you don't know, then you probably don't need one.

No, the days of mining with CPUs and GPUs are over, you'd be lucky if you even made a few cents per year and you'd end up burning out a perfectly good laptop in the process while incurring high electricity costs. If you want to mine bitcoin these days you need specialized hardware called ASICs.

We really can't make financial decisions for you, that's your responsibility. A lot of people here believe in the long term success of Bitcoin and that the price will be much much higher many years from now and so they invest in it. Now it's up to you to do your research on Bitcoin and figure out whether you believe the same, if so then it might be worth it to buy in and hodl for the long term.

Like many government agencies, the IRS has their own group of special investigators that look into any type of suspicious activity, in addition it's already known that they work with various blockchain analysis companies and they've been trying to get user information/records from Bitcoin exchanges like Coinbase as one example.

The cheapest way to buy bitcoin is through an exchange like the following:
* [Gemini](
* [GDAX](
* [Bitstamp](
* [Kraken](
For storing bitcoin you'll want a wallet that you control the keys to. I recommend the following as they are easy to use and secure. Get a hardware wallet for very large amounts and maximum security:
* [Airbitz]( iPhone or Android
* [Breadwallet]( iPhone or Android
* [Electrum]( Desktop
* [Trezor]( Hardware
* [Ledger Nano S]( Hardware
I also recommend reading through the [Newcomer's thread]( to get a better understanding of Bitcoin.

It looks like everything worked fine to me. You sent $48 worth of bitcoin which would probably be around .005 btc and it confirmed to the destination address. The .64 btc is what's called a change address and is not yours, it belongs to Coinbase since they sent the transaction.

There's actually a good reason why it's 10 minutes, I don't know the details of exactly how it works, but it has to do with how long it takes for block information spread across the network; basically there needs to be enough time for nodes to validate new blocks and to propagate across the network. If the block time is too fast then you end up with more orphaned blocks... I probably didn't explain that well, but perhaps someone else will chime in.

I think it'd be a mistake to sell bitcoin for mining equipment given that the competition/hashrate continues to go up and it's taking longer for miners to break-even. I suspect that you'd probably end up with less bitcoin than you have now defeating your plan of accumulating more. On top of that, CMO, the new mining company in Japan is planning on launching a mining operation with 7nm rigs soon which blow away anything on the market, meaning people using S9s or any current rigs will be at a big disadvantage.
Honestly, there are so many technical and economic factors that go into mining these days, that unless you know what you're doing, chances are you're going to lose money.
My advice if you want to accumulate more bitcoin is to hold what you have then work your ass off and cut back on expenses so that you can buy more.

Well you'd want to spend it eventually before you die so you can at least enjoy it, after all, that's the whole point of money, to store value for future consumption, otherwise there's no point to holding bitcoin or any investment asset. 
Also, you presume everyone will have a devaluing alternative to burn, which may or may not be the case. Lets say someone earns most of their income from bitcoin or perhaps was an early investor and decides to retire/stop working and live off of their savings... in fact, there are actually people already doing this now, not a lot, but it exists and is increasing.
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:31:04
I don't understand this, your title says you're investing with bitcoin but your post says you want to presumably convert it to fiat... well which is it? 
If you want to invest in bitcoin then hold on to your bitcoin. If you want to sell it then do a search for bitcoin exchanges and go to them to sell it.

I think you might be confused... your investment is already IN bitcoin, assuming you haven't sold. You have a certain amount of bitcoin and it went up in value in terms of dollars and you only realize USD profit if you sell, which you haven't, which leads to the question, what are you reinvesting with since you have not received any type of USD dividend to 'put back in.'
I think you are thinking about bitcoin as an investment vehicle incorrectly, it's not like a stock or equity that pays out a dividend that you can reinvest with, it's more like a commodity like gold or silver. Think of it like this, if you own a physical gold ounce coin, and the value of that coin goes from say $1,200 to $1,300, you've technically made $100 on paper but it's only realized if you sell the gold coin, otherwise there is nothing to reinvest, you still just have one gold coin - it's the same with bitcoin, you still have the same amount of bitcoin but they're worth more.

We don't know if the fiat value will be half, since it could very well be that Bitcoin is worth a lot more in fiat terms thus making it still profitable to mine. It doesn't matter anyways, since as I've been trying to explain, if there are less miners (less hash power) than the mining difficulty algorithm will adjust lower so that blocks keep being produced every 10 minutes, ie the same throughput. 
Again, while this might be relevant to miners on whether or not it's profitable for them, it is not relevant to the fee market since the throughput stays the same thanks to the difficulty mining algorithm. Fee market is determined by the supply and demand for blockspace, not the mining difficulty to find a block.

Unless an exchange explicitly announces upfront that they'll support claims for both forks then we have no way of knowing what they'll do. The best way to ensure that you get access to forked coins is to keep your bitcoin in a wallet which you hold the private keys to.
@_date: 2018-07-11 20:02:06
Hardware: [Trezor](
Android: [Samourai](
iPhone: [GreenAddress](

All of these are well regarded wallets, support Segwit which mean cheaper fees, and allow custom fees. If you are really looking for security for long term storage than a hardware wallet is the way to go; Trezor is great for this, or even a Ledger is good too.

We can't tell you what to do with your money, that's your responsibility. Ask yourself if you believe in Bitcoin's long-term potential and it's technology, then evaluate how much, if any, that you can afford to risk/lose as an investment.

@_date: 2017-10-02 21:54:07
It depends on the exchange and if they decide to give you the forked coins. That said, I wouldn't count on them to do it for it, just look at how long it's taking Coinbase to still giver their customers Bcash, best to just hold your own keys so you know for sure you can access any forked coins. Also, the Bitcoin Gold fork is on Oct. 25th not in November.

Sort of, but in order for this to work and get more bitcoin, you'd need to rebuy at a lower price than you sold at, which is what many traders attempt to do, but can be quite difficult to time the markets.
Not to be rude or anything, but it doesn't sound like you really know what you're doing and in my personal opinion I'd just hold on to the bitcoin you have and just sit back as the price hopefully keeps going up over the long term.

Ughhh, I love Bitcoin but this is just plain misleading. First as many have already pointed out Bitcoin is not free and not instant. And while settlement on the Bitcoin blockchain or many other crypto chains are technically faster, from a user experience perspective Venmo and Paypal appear instant and more importantly let you make your transaction instantly even though actual settlement is days later.

The reason is because a hardware wallet is the most practical easy to use security solution, and you still get the 24 word recovery seed with a Trezor in case the device is lost or broken.

I think he's referring to something like [BitMesh]( which is in the early stages of development.
Seems like you guys would be much further along in developing something like this since you already have the huge network of wifi hotspots. Regardless, it'd be nice to see a number of groups working on this type of thing, as I think it'd be one of the driving factors of a strong Bitcoin economy.

[Coinbase]( allows you to purchase in Canada but you'd need to connect a bank account.
You could also try [WeSellCrypto]( which you can buy via Paypal, but I'm not sure if it works with Canadian dollars.
Places where you buy Bitcoin have a built in wallet. A wallet is simply a service that lets you store, send, or receive Bitcoin. Those are the basics of a wallet, but different wallets can also have additional added features or functions. Some are mobile, some allow you to buy and sell bitcoin, some have multisignature features, some are connected to a debit card, etc, etc.
What you would normally do is buy Bitcoin from someplace like Coinbase and then transfer those Bitcoins to a wallet where you control the private key, like a mobile wallet for example if you are using small amounts. Wallets like [Mycelium]( for Android, [Bread Wallet]( for iPhone, or [Airbitz]( for both are all decent options.
I would not recommend trying to mine Bitcoin as it is a highly technical, competitive, and costly endeavor especially if you don't know what you are doing. Unless you know how to build custom processing devices on the cutting edge of computing then you won't get anywhere in mining.
Here's a few bits to get you started in the Bitcoin ecosystem :) 4000 bits
I would use these bits and transfer some between Changetip and a few wallets, and that will help you to understand the transaction process better. Let us know if you have further questions.
@_date: 2019-09-06 19:52:02
It's better if you control your own keys and not leave it in custody of an exchange, however, you should first learn how to use a wallet and how to properly back it up and keep your passphrase safe; so I'd say it's fine on the exchange until which time you get comfortable with storing your own keys in your own wallet.
Check out this great Andreas video on the matter:

It probably isn't lost for good. If you're sure your identifier and password is correct then you should be able to get access to the funds, it could just be the website is not working correctly at the moment. Perhaps try again later, or contact their support. Also, Blockchain has a number of backup options available, did you do any backups?
The lesson here is:
1) Don't use wallet services that are known to be troublesome as well as wallet services where you don't control the private keys.
2) Always make sure you take the necessary steps to backup your wallet and be sure you know how to recover it if needed.

I have mixed feelings on this so far and usually stick to the mantra of 'not your keys, not your coins', however they've recently introduced some intriguing services that have me looking into them. 
For example, you can lend out funds as a stablecoin in GUSD for example and earn interest in BTC... that's compelling since you're not risking funds to volatility but can still gain in BTC. This has me thinking, ok maybe I might use some of my fiat savings, convert it to GUSD and lend it out to increase my BTC stack.
Or, you can also do the reverse and lend out BTC and earn in GUSD, which is also compelling since that gives you fiat to spend on a monthly basis while keeping your hodl position intact.
Of course, all of this comes with risk of keeping either stablecoins or btc with a third party. It does seem like they have significant backing and protections in place and custody is with Gemini which I feel is one of the most secure exchanges out there... so I don't know, I'm hesitant, but curious at the moment.

No, you're wrong on that. It doesn't matter how many miners there are since the difficulty rate will adjust accordingly so that there will always be on average a block produced every 10 minutes regardless of the number of miners.

Segwit does help somewhat with transactions since there's a bit more blockspace but the real benefit is that it enables second layer scaling solutions to be built like Lightning Network and sidechains as a few examples, and these would dramatically improve transactions so that they are instant and cheap.

My guess is that it will rise over the next 5 years although that is speculation based on observation of the expanding infrastructure of the Bitcoin ecosystem and venture capital investments. It could also fail, but nobody knows.
The way I look at it, is that the upside potential is far greater than the downside risk. So if you bought one Bitcoin for ~$240 you could lose that but it wouldn't be a big loss, however, if Bitcoin does gain traction and becomes a major currency then that 1 Bitcoin will be worth a heck of a lot of value. Would you be willing to put $240 on the line for a potential pay back of $3,000; $30,000; $300,000; or even a million?

The transaction to get your money from the bank to Coinbase was via bank transfer (ACH) and the reason it took 7 days. This is NOT a bitcoin transaction, this is the legacy banking system. A typical bitcoin transaction between two bitcoin wallets will be anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour or so if the there is a big backlog in the mempool.
As far as Chinese miners, they'll just relocate, or other mining farms will prop up to replace them, not a big deal due to Bitcoin's value there'll always be people wanting to mine it and get the reward.

Think of it like email which is a protocol for sending and receiving messages. There is no one business that provides email, there are a whole bunch like Gmail, Yahoo, AOL for example that use the email protocol.
Well Bitcoin is a protocol and businesses like Coinbase, Circle.com, ChangeTip.com, etc are services that use the bitcoin protocol to buy, send, receive Bitcoins (the currency) between users.
It's a little difficult to understand at first, since the creators didn't do a good job of differentiating between the protocol part of Bitcoin and the currency part of Bitcoin.
Here's a few bits to get you started in the ecosystem :) 5000 bits

*sigh*... you keep omitting the part about how less miners means that the difficulty algorithm decreases to adjust for less hash-rate so that block production stays consistent. Even if there's less miners, there will still be some miners that compete to produce the next block every 10 minutes average and those miners are still the ones who put the transactions in the block, which is why I keep saying that throughput stays the same.

As everyone else said, it's an experiment and in 5 years it could be anything really, who knows. The way I look at it is that the upside potential is far far greater than the downside potential. Lets say I buy 1 bitcoin right now at approximately $230, sure I could lose that money if the Bitcoin experiment fails, but the trend over the last few years has been of an expanding ecosystem, along with hundreds of millions in venture capital investment... even though the price doesn't reflect it now, the momentum in building out the infrastructure is looking pretty damn good. If Bitcoin succeeds, then I could see it as a potential world currency which if the case could be over $1 million per Bitcoin... but again this is all speculation.

Storing bitcoins on Localbitcoins is probably not a good idea, you'll want to move them to a wallet you control. Check out the following page for the different types of wallets:

A lot of things seem obvious in hindsight, but from someone who was a teenager when the Internet was just getting started, I can assure you that at the time most people thought it was just a fad and had no real utility for their lives. You seem to be making a case that the transition of people jumping on board the Internet bandwagon was an easy task... it most certainly was not, getting people online, even to just use email at work was quite a struggle.

It's going to be tough since the legacy financial system doesn't really cater to people under 18 years old.
My suggestion would be to focus on earning Bitcoin, this way you can bypass traditional banking and deal directly in bitcoin. In addition, this is a great time in your life to practice your entrepreneurial skills. You'll likely make a lot of mistakes in the process but consider this a good learning opportunity that'll set you up for a lucrative future once this thing gets big :)
One suggestion I would say to pay attention to is earning btc by selling/trading digital game items. It's still a small market but in my opinion will start growing quite rapidly within the next year.
If you play CSGO, then you could sell skins via [Opskins]( for bitcoin. In addition, once Spells of Genesis launches it's full release version of the game in a month or two, you'll be able to sell maxed out cards for btc or byc, so that's worth paying attention to.

You probably should have sent it to your own wallet that you control rather than another broker service that is subject to AML/KYC regulation. Also, if you're already buying from Coinbase, there isn't much need to go to a BTM or Circle... very confusing.

If the wallets integrate it properly then the end user probably wouldn't even know they were using Lightning - the wallet software would just automatically select the best channels to use. I imagine in the future, Lightning will simply be the default payment method for all wallets and only do an onchain transaction if selected.

Of course, earning bitcoin shouldn't be much different than earning any other kind of money, just offer some service that people want and charge them as usual in fiat but also offer them a discount if they pay with Bitcoin. You could do things like mow lawns, rake leaves, shovel out driveways and cars, dog walking, babysitting, washing cars, etc.
You could also do freelance work or sell things via the following services:
* [XBTfreelancer](
* [Cryptogrind](
* [Coinality](
* [Bitgigs](
* **Market Places**
* [OpenBazaar](
* [Purse.io](
* [Bitify](

I grew up a teenager as the Internet was just starting and was personally really into it. I was basically perceived as an "Internet hobbyist", much like people perceive those who tinker with ham radios and what not.
It was exciting times for me, especially when I finally saved up enough money to buy a 14.4k modem which was a pretty big deal at the time. I still remember the day of coming home from the computer show with my brand new modem, opening up the top of my IBM XT, carefully going through the whole installation process, troubleshooting, I felt like a mad scientist, it was so cool; and my little bro who was just a kiddo at the time was in awe of the whole operation. 
Of course my mom was pretty pissed when she found out that I had to commandeer the phone-line whenever I wanted to use the modem to "[call]( the Internets, which meant my random exploration of the local Bulletin Board Systems were relegated to late night - fine by me - more time to play TW2002 under the shadow of darkness.
I had an email address on my favorite BBS and remember asking all my family and friends if anyone wanted to email each other, and I'd just get blank stares or confused questions, "Why would I need to go through such a complicated process to send a message when I can just pick up the phone and call your house?" 
Uggg, they just didn't get it, nobody saw the potential yet since the technology was too complicated to use, and only made sense if everyone used it. Afterall, what's the point of having an email if you have no one to send messages to? Sound familiar :)

I realize it can be confusing, but you do't need to download the full blockchain, nor do you need to run Bitcoin Core to use Bitcoin. There are many wallets to choose from that use a different type of validation system that are lightweight and easier to use which you can find here:
I'm not sure how exactly to recover your funds sent to your Bitcoin Core, but I don't think the transaction will complete until it's synced. There's a way to recover these Bitcoin but it's beyond my technical knowledge, so hopefully someone else here can provide the info. I believe it involves transferring the private key to another wallet. One thing is to make sure you don't delete it or remove Core until you recover the coins since that will almost assuredly lose the coins.

I never signed any contracts. Look, you can call it whatever you want but that doesn't mean that force is not used in the collection of taxes regardless of whether or not you think the services that come from those taxes are useful or not. This is not a voluntary system. All I'm doing is pointing out a simple truth here, not debating the usefulness of various government services. Tax collection relies on coercion and if you don't pay them you get locked up.


Of course, it's easy to simply roll out the old "If you don't like it just leave" argument which could easily be turned around - I suppose socialists could just move to Venezuela or North Korea. It's a silly argument from anyone since we are not really "free" to move anywhere we want since not only does the U.S. charge a good chunk of money to give up citizenship but there are also varying immigration policies/restrictions depending on what country you'd want to move to, and that's besides the logistical components, family, friends, language barriers, etc that factor into where one lives - so not quite as simple as just move to so and so country.

I think it might be the opposite - it won't be widespread until it succeeds. In other words, most people won't want to hold or accept a currency unless they know that it will hold value over time, otherwise they'd just exchange it for another currency or goods and services right away. 
So even if someone like Roger Ver gave away all of his Bitcoins, the people receiving them would likely sell and crash the price. Thus in order for bitcoin to be widespread, it needs to be successful, which means it requires that these small number of holders of large amounts of btc to continue to hold and make it a valuable commodity.

It does make sense to USE bitcoin for a dating site as opposed to credit cards, so this way you're not storing all the name, address, cc info in one big honey pot that is subject to stealing such as Ashley Madison hack.
A good example of a site using bitcoin payment to keep it's users anonymous is [Xotika.tv](

It's a fine wallet no doubt, but my main issue with them is that they've decided on going in the direction of becoming a mediocre multi-currency wallet than a really great Bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2019-09-14 19:36:34
Because presumably those bitcoin still have value and you'd want them if it was profitable to mine for them.
Why do you think people kept mining after the first halving from 50 to 25? Why do you think people kept mining after the second halving from 25 to 12.5?
And, by the way, after both of those halvings, blocks kept being produced every 10 minutes on average despite the rewards being halved.

This is how Bitcoin takes over in the long term; by the time these kids are 18 and old enough to legally open a bank account and credit card, they'll already be used to using a Bitcoin based financial system and the old legacy system will seem pointless by comparison. 
This is happening all over too, kids are way more likely to know and use Bitcoin than most of us old farts, and it's more practical for them as well since at their age they are part of what we'd call the "underserved" in terms of financial product accessibility.

If you can't trust these companies to share a database then you also won't be able to trust them to make changes to a medical record on a blockchain. You will still need healthcare people to update those records and to make sure it's accurate, and putting that info on a blockchain doesn't automatically make that information true or correct similar to a database.
I'm not saying that bitcoin multisig is no good, I was saying the multi-sig example presented above was no good. Mult-sig is great if used correctly, but using it does not mean automatic safety. Just look at the recent Bitfinex hack and the failure of their BitGo multi-sig implementation that caused them to lose 70 million dollars.
Blockchain is great for Bitcoin as money because you're only dealing with simple ledger transactions of which coins belong to which keys, that's it, immutable and decentralized, albeit at the large cost that comes with proof of work; it's a trade-off. 
Medical records on the other hand are much more dynamic and complex set of information that requires lots of input from humans which are fallible and subject to errors, thus all you'd get is blockchain that is filled with the same information that'd also be on a distributed database except you're using massive amounts of resources to secure something that you're going to end up editing anyways, so it really seems kind of pointless.
Putting things on a blockchain isn't some panacea for a single source of truth, it's just an inefficient database... ah fuck it, whatever, I don't even know why I got so worked up over this, I need a beer, good luck with your conference :)

You're right, as a payment method AMEX is pretty good right now assuming the merchants you use accept it and you can get one which usually isn't a problem in most first world countries.
Bitcoin is still experimental, there is a lot of work to do, and it's certainly not ready for mainstream adoption yet, so it is probably best for you to stick to your credit cards if those already meet your needs.

I think what will be really interesting is that due to that brief period of rapid block mining on BCH chain, they'll have a halving about 1 month prior to Bitcoin's halving; which means significantly less profitability to mine BCH and could see them lose A LOT more hash power and the chain will be quite vulnerable to attack (more so than it already is) and possibly even lead to a mining death spiral.

I'm wondering if someone screwed up a big transaction and accidentally switched the amounts in the various fields.
Edit: It's back down to 10 btc fees so it's most definitely someone screwing up a transaction, hopefully that person can get it resolved with the miner who processed the block, otherwise that's gonna be a serious bummer.

Neither has said anything about it but I doubt either would be good for Bitcoin. Clinton supports the establishment and is backed by big banks. Trump has mentioned he wants to crack down on remittances from the US to other countries, particularly Latin America, so based on that I can't imagine he'd support Bitcoin as a means for easily transmitting money.
The only candidate so far that has been in support of Bitcoin is Rand Paul but he's currently low in the polls.
There is still quite a ways to go until the election, and I imagine there will be some interesting developments along the way. I wouldn't assume those two candidates are the "probable" ones just yet.

Yea I read that and it still doesn't make sense. Offering a 0.1 BTC option doesn't prevent you from also having a 1 BTC option. If you can have 0.1, 2.5, 5, 7, 9, and 12 then what's stopping you from having 1BTC or 0.5 or any amount for that matter?

It sounds like a complicated and convoluted use of a blockchain for the sake of using a blockchain when a much more efficient, effective, and cheaper system could be designed using database tech.
In addition, your multi-sig implementation scenario still entrusts a third party in case you lose your keys, so the counterparty risk is still there which is no similar than trusting a third party with the password to an account via database, except now you've added additional complexity to the system.
You've really not presented any additional benefits to the user or institutions using a blockchain that can't already be accomplished with a distributed database system. I'm sorry, I know people love to throw around the word 'blockchain' but it's not really that useful for most things.

If you were going to buy when it was higher, then you are getting a deal buying it cheaper, buy the dip. Just don't risk more than you can afford to lose. You need to think of Bitcoin as a long term investment, as in years for the technology to continue to develop and increase adoption. If you're going to get emotional with the short term fluctuations of the price then this probably isn't for you.

I believe Circle.com allows you to buy a small amount with a credit card without ID, but you do need to give ID for larger amounts.
You probably won't find many legit brokers that take CC without asking for further identity information since they both need to comply with AML/KYC rules AND protect themselves from people who use stolen CC info.

Well to be fair, Coinbase does tell you in advance what the requirements are for withdrawing from the vault, one of those being 48 hour delay, which is meant to be a security feature for long term holders. If your plan was to time the market and trade your Bitcoins then you chose a poor way of storing them. 
It's easy in hindsight to say "if this" and "if that" I could have made some money, but it doesn't sound like you planned this strategy ahead of time.

Getting Bitcoin these days is no more difficult than opening up a Paypal or a regular checking account and compared to a few years ago we have all kinds of options for exchanging fiat to Bitcoin. Your issue is that you want an anonymous way to get Bitcoin which is difficult due to government regulations which is not the fault of Bitcoin. 
If you really want Bitcoin without the hassle of going through an exchange or broker, then perhaps you should earn it by offering a product or service in exchange for it, you know the same way people earn fiat?

I think the best approach is to tip people who are already interested in Bitcoin or maybe on the fence but haven't taken the jump into setting up a wallet and actually using the technology yet. I don't think it's a good idea to start spamming random people with tips and trying to ram Bitcoin down their throats in an aggressive salesman approach, that'll just turn them away even more. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:18:25
A Bitcoin, aka 1BTC, is divisible by 100 million units or 8 decimal places. If you shift the decimal to the right you can have smaller units of account. For example, if you shift the decimal to right by three spaces you get the milibit unit or 1mBTC = .001 BTC. If you shift the decimal to the right by six spaces you get a "bit" or .000001 BTC. If you go over to the right the full eight places you get the smallest unit, 1 Satoshi = .00000001 BTC.
So if you want to get a cup of coffee for around $5, rather than using fractions of a BTC, one might buy it for 10,000 bits at the current rate.

There's some good arguments that this is not necessarily true:

* Earn fees for mixing bitcoin via (technical)
* Lending to margin traders on exchanges like Bitfinex (risky)
* Lending via [Bitbond]( (risky)
Obviously these all have some varying levels of risk. Honestly, I don't see why anyone would put their precious bitcoins at risk in the hands of a third party when the gains on just holding bitcoin itself are already an amazing investment.

You could try buying directly from an exchange, that'd give you much higher limits. Here's a few to check out:

Sigh, no, no, no he hasn't been on point, a majority of his predictions have missed their marks and the ones that he does get are either very vague, completely miss-timed, or things that already occur on a regular basis like natural disasters and such.
He had already predicted huge rise in Bitcoin above 800s by end of August which didn't happen. He predicted that Hillary was dead, would miss first debate, drop out of the race by now - all didn't happen. Predicted the world would end back in 2012 - obviously didn't happen.
I've said it before and I'll say it again, the guy is a snake oil salesmen - basically a modern day Nostradamaus who is simply just throwing out large amounts predictions. When he eventually gets something right, he'll brag and proclaim it to the world, but not surprisingly he never ever talks about the huge amounts of things he gets wrong.
By the way, he's also predicting in the video an Alien Space Liner will do a cruise around the planet soon... really? It's entertaining no doubt, but come on, you guys take this guy seriously? 
I think I might start a blog that simply keeps track of this guy's predictions in order to have a running tally.

So here's the dilemma, you can either have one of the following:
* Easy, fast, cheap bitcoins BUT requires giving up anonymity by providing identification info to the seller
* Anonymous bitcoins BUT more difficult and costly to get
Unfortunately, at this time, you don't really get both.
If you want an easy and cheap way to get bitcoins then yes, [Coinbase]( and [Circle]( are good options, but it requires identity verification.
If you want something more anonymous, you could try the following options:
* [LocalBitcoins.com]( p2p trades
* [Mycelium Local Trader]( p2p trades
* [Bitsquare]( decentralized p2p trades
* [LibertyX]( for cash
* [Any Bitcoin ATM]( for cash
Keep in mind that even some of these options may require ID info depending on the amounts or location you buy, but like I said, getting into bitcoin anonymously takes a little more leg work.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:40:04
The problem with these transaction accelerators is that they actually make things worse. They prioritize low fee transactions over higher fee transactions and thus have the effect of increasing the average satoshi/byte for a fast transaction. It really goes against economic logic and the only reason I see ViaBTC providing this service is for propaganda (the pop-up) and to make more money by promoting their paid accelerator service.

The best approach is to help those that are already interested or on the fence yet haven't taken the plunge to actually getting a wallet and using the technology. There will be plenty of these people to help as they naturally become curious due to all the media attention on the price rise.

Actually looking at this further, it appears that the tip information is derived from the blockchain data of incoming transactions to whatever address the person provided, so if that person is reusing an address and had a large amount of Bitcoin transferred to it unrelated to the site, then it'll still show as a tip - in that sense the site is being a bit deceptive, albeit unintentionally, at how much tips a post is earning.

This sounds a bit complicated for new people, especially if they're not very technically inclined. 
I think the best way to engage new people interested in Bitcoin is to set them up with a basic mobile wallet like Mycelium, Bread Wallet, or Airbitz and then transfer a small amount of Bitcoin to them to demonstrate how it works, show how to backup the wallet, then let them know of some places they can buy from if the want.

That's cool. It seems a bit premature to start marketing it as a cam girl site though since there is no indication that it is one.
I'd suggest adding some type of one-stop directory somewhere on the site so that people can go there and see who's streaming and join in rather than leaving all the marketing and viewer accumulation up to the stream owners. I think [XOtika.tv]( has a very good setup for this and might be worth looking at how they do things.

In addition to what was mentioned in the article, I think people here don't recognize how big bitcoin is getting in the gaming space, there is a huge market for trading CSGO items in bitcoin either due to the traders being kids or in an area of the world not able to get a bank account/credit card.
And now with game items actually being put on the blockchain via Counterparty assets like Spells of Genesis for example, with market place wallet apps like [Book of Orbs]( I think this will be revolutionary for gaming.

I don't get the selling thing, I feel like one of the points of Bitcoin is to use it as it's own currency, one that is liberated from the control of governments and central banks, so I'm not sure why anyone would want to sell back into fiat unless they're just into it to make a quick buck... and if that is the case then it's hard for me to sympathize.

They only allow so much to be purchased instantly per week, $1,000 worth I think. The reason for this is because they need to wait for the deposit transaction to clear from your bank, otherwise someone could transfer out their Bitcoin and then cancel the bank transfer, thus screwing Coinbase out of money - the problem isn't with Coinbase or Bitcoin, it's the fault of a slow archaic legacy banking system.

Surprised that more of the adult entertainment industry isn't jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon, I mean if you're into that stuff then why would you trust these sites to securely handle your credit card info which includes your real name, address, etc... 
XOtika.tv has such a great system, just scan the QR code to send Bitcoins, no name or any other info is given, don't even have to provide an email or login if you don't want to, it's a really great model for cam sites.
And you would think with the hack of AshleyMadison.com that it and other similar "dating" sites would be onboard with Bitcoin as well, heck, that'd be HUGE selling point, aka - YOU CAN PAY WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION!

That is a good point, and perhaps I'm not getting why you said Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, which I'm still confused by your definition I guess. As I mentioned in one of my above comments, the value of Bitcoin lies in the network, it has a real utility function that people can use, and you readily admit that the technology behind it (blockchain) is valuable but you don't seem to get that the Bitcoin token used to transfer value across that network is what makes the whole thing run and enables a trustless decentralized network, otherwise the Blockchain is just a fancy database that lacks the same robustness and security that the Bitcoin network provides.

From the [FAQ](




@_date: 2017-05-17 17:51:23
Airbitz and Breadwallet are iphone or android apps you use on your phone. Electrum is a desktop wallet. I wouldn't recommend any web based wallets as they tend to be unreliable.
Each wallet has a backup mechanism to it which allows you to recover your funds in the case that your phone or computer is compromised in some way either lost/stolen/damaged. Airbitz's backup is to simply remember or write down the username and password. Breadwallet's and Electrum's backup is to write down a set of 12-13 words on a piece of paper and keep it in a safe place - those words are tied to your private keys and allows you to recover any funds held in the wallet.
As for investing, I always recommend a [Dollar Cost Averaging strategy]( and simply holding for the long term. I have been doing this for over three years now and it has been extremely profitable even though I initially bought in near the top of the  2013 bubble.
@_date: 2015-11-17 20:43:08
Probably a better question for but as others have mentioned it's probably not worth it, you'd likely be better off just buying Bitcoin outright and holding it.

Well if you're using a broker service like Coinbase or Circle to buy from, which usually requires connecting to a bank account or credit card, then you'll need to use your real name otherwise you won't be able to buy from them since the name on the account won't match the one from the bank or cc you're using.
If all you want is a wallet for sending, receiving, and storing bitcoins, then you should just go with one not controlled by a third party, but yourself, such as the following:
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)
* [Breadwallet]( (iPhone or Android)
* [Mycelium]( (Android)
* [Copay]( (all devices)
* [Electrum]( (Desktop)
The general rule of thumb is buy from brokers or exchanges, then send the bitcoins to a wallet in which you hold the private keys.
And if you're trying get bitcoin more anonymously, which I suspect you are given your user name, check out the following:
* [LibertyX]( for cash
* [LocalBitcoins.com]( p2p trades
* [Paxful.com]( p2p trades
* [Any Bitcoin ATM]( for cash

It might not exactly fit your question but if you go by the US GDP figure of $16.77 Trillion and divide it by 21 million Bitcoins, then each Bitcoin would be worth $798,571 per BTC. And since there are less than 21 million currently, around 15 million or so, then each BTC would be over $1 million each. Although I'm sure there are some flaws with my methodology, based on your question, the price per BTC would certainly need to be very very large.

It depends on if you think bitcoin will be successful or even mainstream in the future, if so then the price will have to be much much higher than today, but of course we can't tell the future and we really don't know what'll happen, but many people buy and hold bitcoin for the long term thinking it will continue it's path of growth.
My advice, do your research and if bitcoin looks promising to you then take a [dollar cost averaging strategy]( and hold for the long term.

I'd like to point out some corrections to what you wrote. 
First, Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin are supposed to be written as one word, no need to separate it as Bit Coin.
Second, Bitcoin is not technically anonymous, it is pseudonymous. Basically it is possible to track transactions through the blockchain so if someone can tie an identity to a transaction it is possible to track it, although there are ways to obscure those transactions to make it more anonymous.
Third, there are actually transaction costs via miner fees, although they tend to be very tiny, only a few cents or less usually.
Fourth, yes Bitcoin does use electricity but I wouldn't call it a waste, it is used to secure the network. [Here's a good article on the subject] (

Yea, CPU mining only really worked well the first few years of Bitcoins existence, since then the difficulty has increased significantly and you'll need very new and specialized equipment to even consider profitable mining. Using your laptop is going to end up costing you much more in electricity cost then what you'd make mining if anything.

RCs? As in research chemicals, aka drugs... yea man, that's most likely against their terms and legal or not, not a good idea to buy directly using your circle wallet. You should always send bitcoin to a wallet you hold the private keys to first after buying, before doing any merchant transactions. And if you're dealing with dark markets and illegal stuff then you definitely need to do way more opsec.
As far as the vendor not getting the coins, are you sure it isn't a scam site?

My approach to Bitcoin advocacy is to help out those that are already interested or on the fence but haven't yet jumped into setting up a wallet or actually using the technology.

It would fix it only temporarily and at the cost of decentralization, but since there is such high demand for blockchain space it'd fill up quite quickly which is why it's important to get Segwit activated so that developers can start deploying second layer scaling solutions which would give the Bitcoin network MASSIVE scaling beyond VISA levels of transactions.

You can buy small amounts instantly with a credit or debit card.

I think the best way to promote it is by showing people you know, who are interested in it, how a wallet works and how to send bits between wallets. Usually when people hear about Bitcoin they hear all these techy buzzwords and it's very intimidating, but once they see how easy it is to download a wallet app to their phone and get a few bits sent to it, it usually clicks much better.
Just don't be a pushy salesman about it, only show people who express an interest in it, don't try to shove it in people's faces.

My instant buy limit is $1000 per week which I think is as high as they'll go on Instant Buy unless you apply for even higher limits. It makes sense to me for any exchange or broker to limit instant buys since it opens them up to fraud otherwise. You have to understand that since an ACH transfer can take days, the company doesn't want to risk you withdrawing your Bitcoin and then canceling the transfers, thus screwing them over. Even on Kraken, they're not going to let you buy and withdraw Bitcoins until the bank transfers for payment are cleared.
Regardless, here's some other places to buy from:
* [Circle.com]( for credit, debit, bank transfer
* [ChangeTip.com]( small amounts w/ credit/debit
* [LibertyX]( for cash
* [BitQuick.co](
* [LocalBitcoins.com](
* [Any Bitcoin ATM]( for cash

If you're buying with debit/credit card on Circle you should be able to get it instantly. Although you're instant buy limit might be limited but that can be increased by providing ID verification I believe.
Of course, 300 bitcoins debit buy would be out of the question for any broker, but I assume you really want $300 worth of Bitcoin?

The problem with r/btc and many subreddits in general is that the users don't actually follow Reddiquette. They use the upvote and downvote arrows as "agree" and "disagree" buttons when that is not how voting is supposed to work, it's supposed to be about the relevancy of the comment to the topic at hand. 
Instead, on r/btc you get very hateful vitriolic hyperbolic comments highly upvoted as long as they fit the majority narrative of big block while small blockers that try to engage in technical civilized discourse get downvoted to oblivion. So if you think r/btc is some kind of diverse objective sub for discourse, then I don't man, doesn't seem to fit my observations of the behavior of that sub.
@_date: 2016-05-13 22:56:55
Most people here are Bitcoin enthusiasts so the answers you get will be biased in favor of Bitcoin. That said, if Bitcoin does become successful in the long term as a world wide currency then the price will have to be significantly higher than it is now, like in the millions per BTC, so if you think it'll be successful then getting just one bitcoin now, around $450 at current price, or even a smaller amount would put you in a good position 5-10 years from now.
Of course, we really don't know what will happen, this is all speculation, and it could also fail. My opinion is that the upside potential is much greater than the downside risk, thus it doesn't hurt to put in a small amount as a risky but high reward potential investment. Just don't put in more money than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:09:26

This is not the fault of bitcoin, it's that way because of an outdated archaic legacy banking system. A company selling bitcoin needs to wait for bank transfers and cc transactions to settle before giving large amounts to anyone otherwise one could transfer out the bitcoin then cancel the bank transaction thus screwing over the company.
Once you're in the bitcoin ecosystem though it is very easy to move money/bitcoin around quickly and efficiently.

In terms of settlement, this is still much faster than the legacy banking sector.

Well for starters don't put ALL your cash into Bitcoin.

It is regularly stated in this sub and by most Bitcoin proponents - don't put in more then you can afford to lose.

You don't need to wait for that many confirmations for the transaction to occur, usually only 1 or 2 confirmations is necessary for most wallet to wallet transfers and that typically takes about 10 minutes, much faster settlement than a banks usual 3-5 days which is the main cause for delays when buying Bitcoin with USD from a bank account.

Centralized banking systems can also take your money through the act of a bail-ins like we've already [seen in Cyprus]( and [being imposed on other EU countries]( like Spain, the one you trust with your money.
Centralized banking systems can also [lock you out of your funds]( like we've recently seen in Greece where people could not get access to the funds in their bank accounts while [limited to a tiny ATM withdrawal]( amount per day.
Frankly, I'm surprised that a Spanish citizen would be so trusting of their Government and central banking system given that you live in one of those countries that is [skating on thin ice]( in terms of financial stability, you could very well be the next Cyprus or next Greece - do you really want to have so much faith in a centralized system that can do whatever they want with your money?
Yes, it is possible to make mistakes in sending money with Bitcoin, but the technology is getting better to help make it easier to use and prevent mistakes. Also, Bitcoin promotes personal responsibility, it does not cater to those who are apathetic with their money. Having irreversible transactions is feature not a bug, it means that centralized systems can not screw you over. With Bitcoin you are in control of your own money, not someone else, and that is empowering.

Second, your transaction ID provided does not correspond with the amount you claimed to have sent, and even if it did, all that shows is that money was sent to some BTC address - it provides no evidence of the sites legitimacy.

For the most part Coinbase is pretty secure and they are insured, so I wouldn't worry too much about them just be sure to take advantage of their two-factor authentication sign in process.
That said, if they disappeared over night, it depends on how your coins were stored - if you used their multi-signature option you'd be able to recover the coins from the Blockchain so long as you have the appropriate 2 of 3 private keys stored safely somewhere. If you're using their regular wallet service where they control the private keys then the coins would likely be lost for good... again though, this is an unlikely scenario.

Bitcoin is money, like dollars or euros, do you expect people to just give away money like that?
There are some sites called faucets which give out very very small amounts of Bitcoin, like fractions of a cent, just do a Google search for 'Bitcoin faucets', but don't expect to make anything significant with them. If you really want Bitcoin you either need to exchange your dollars for it or earn it by exchanging your labor, goods or services for it.

Why are you making the assumption that he is afraid? He was simply asking a question on the safety of buying Bitcoins. As I mentioned before, gathering information and trying to learn more about an unfamiliar technology doesn't mean one is scared, it just means they are being cautious about what they are getting into, which is very smart in my opinion. And while you probably didn't mean it, I interpreted your initial comment as an insult.

Yes, this is normal, Mycelium is an HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallet and it creates a new address each time you use one to help with privacy. And while it's a good idea to use the new addresses you can still receive bitcoin from any of the old addresses it creates, so nothing to worry about, you should still get those coins.
@_date: 2018-04-03 02:29:31
If you're looking for privacy then you shouldn't be storing Bitcoin on any exchange, keep them in a secure wallet in which you control the keys. As for buying Bitcoin, check out Bisq or Localbitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:51:39
Whether or not it's a safe bet is subjective, we don't really know what's going to happen, but many people do think the future for bitcoin is promising and do hold bitcoin for the long term.

Yes you can reuse any of the 'codes' aka Public Addresses that your wallet generates and it will receive the funds. For example I just sent you another 1000 bits straight into your Bread Wallet based on the address you just posted. The reason your wallet generates a new public address each time is to help with privacy, so other people can't easily track your funds, but like I said, any address generated can have money sent to it multiple times forever and it'll go into your wallet. 
Hope that clears it up, let me know if you have any other questions :)
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:15:45
You'll have to poke around in your Bread Wallet app, there should be a "backup" setting in which it will give you 12 words to write down on a piece of paper. Those 12 words are tied directly to your private key, so long as you have those you can recover your wallet and funds in the wallet should your phone get lost, stolen, or damaged. Make sure you do this before moving any significant amount of Bitcoins into it and make sure you store those 12 words in a safe place, not online.

It depends on if you think bitcoin will be successful or even mainstream in the future, if so then the price will have to be much much higher than today, but of course we can't tell the future and we really don't know what'll happen, but many people buy and hold bitcoin for the long term thinking it will continue it's path of growth.
My advice, do your research and if bitcoin looks promising to you then take a [dollar cost averaging strategy]( and hold for the long term. 
Also, don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

If you're in debt then you don't have any money to invest in Bitcoin anyways. My suggestion is to work on increasing your skills and earning more money to take care of your debt and then start saving whether it be in dollars or Bitcoin.


Lol, oh that's all, well then right this way... look man, this is not meant to be a get rich quick scheme. Yes, there are early adopters who speculated/gambled early on and got a lot of Bitcoin that rose in value over time, but in the end Bitcoin is money, and you earn Bitcoin the same way you earn any other money, by trading your labor, goods, or services for it.

It's understandable to want to keep value in the Bitcoin ecosystem and actually conducting trade where fiat is left out of the equation all together, however, using Bitcoin as a payment system even if it gets converted immediately to dollars does demonstrate to merchants a demand for this system... hopefully. 
What you can do is simply spend Bitcoin and then buyback whatever amount you spent. In addition, you could seek out sellers who are known to hold and conduct their business in Bitcoin; while there aren't many of those merchants yet, it'll hopefully increase in the future with decentralized Bitcoin marketplaces like OpenBazaar for example.

Well more throughput means a user's transaction has a better chance to get into an earlier block so yes, in a sense you could consider that faster. The time to process a block would remain the same.
I'm not sure if it would help with better mining equipment, however, it does mean that miners could also eventually run Lightening Network nodes as well which would increase their profitability.

What you're experiencing is called FOMO (fear of missing out). 
Nobody can tell you how to best invest your money. There are many around here who believe that Bitcoin will be a major disruptive technology and become widely adopted over the long term in many years, and if that is the case the price of a Bitcoin will be significantly higher than it is now. 
So the question you need to ask yourself is do you believe in the long term potential of Bitcoin? If the answer is yes, then I think it makes sense to buy and hold over the long term, just don't put in more money than you can afford to lose.
Here's a few bits to get you started if you're interested :)

Ethereum or ether is not meant to be a currency like bitcoin but more of a gas for fueling smart contracts, the founder of Ethereum has even mentioned this himself.

If he managed to hold on over all this time then yeah he'd be doing pretty well by now although those 3 years would certainly be much more of a financial burden since he'd also be making payments plus added interest to service the giant loan he took out.
Keep in mind there was a lot of doom and gloom back when we were trudging in the $200s, then there was the Hernia scare in the $400s, and then later on the Bitfinex hack, and of course the ongoing scaling drama... it'd be pretty tough to hold a very large position in bitcoin with all that negativity and a giant financial debt over your head... but yea, hopefully he held out.

Bitcoin is still an experimental technology and certainly still in it's early stages, enough that anyone getting in on it now would still be considered an early adopter. 
That said, unless you have considerable technical knowledge and cheap or free electricity, mining Bitcoin will not be worth it. As a speculative investment, I always say that the upside potential is far greater than the downside risk, and while I certainly wouldn't put my life savings into it, it makes sense to me that one should try to get at least 1 bitcoin while it's cheap. If Bitcoin does take off, and the trend continually looks better and better, then 1 bitcoin will be worth a heck of a lot in purchasing power; and if Bitcoin fails then the loss of $370 or so is not that much of an effect on one's life.

As far as investing, there's no guarantee that it'll keep increasing, we don't know what is going to happen.

It might seem like Bitcoin is in a lull now due to the lower amounts of media attention, however, the infrastructure continues to be built out and venture capital money continues to pour into new Bitcoin related startups. 
Here's a few things that are on the way within the next year.
* The mining reward will [halve in July 2016]( decreasing the supply/inflation rate of new Bitcoin entering the ecosystem.
* [OpenBazaar]( should be coming online.
* Hopefully the Bitcoin ETF will come online, indications from the Winklevii still seem positive.
* [Abra]( will be getting started.
* [Augur]( will be up and running.
* The 21 Bitcoin computer thing will be out and if it proves to be useful start seeing developers making neat things with them.
* We'll likely see become more user friendly and implemented in various wallets such as [Samourai Wallet](
* We'll see more games similar to [Chopcoin.io]( that use Bitcoin/crypto as in game currency.
* Lightning network and sidechains will start to be implemented.
* Services like [Joystream]( will help to integrate Bitcoin into creating an incentive structure for existing p2p networks like BitTorrent.
* More wallets are being created with innovative features.
* Bitcoin ATMs have skyrocketed in places like Romania, Ukraine, and others.
* Adoption, exchange traffic, and Google Trend analytics continues to increase in developing economies.
And that's the stuff just off the top of my head, there is a lot going on in the pipeline and as someone who experienced the birth, growth, and dotcom boom of the Internet, Bitcoin looks very much like the late 90s right now. In my opinion, Bitcoin is just getting started and in the words of Doc Brown, "If my calculations are correct... you're gonna see some serious shit." :)

Breadwallet is a good wallet to use and even has an integrated way to buy bitcoin so maybe check that out. I have personally never had a problem with Coinbase and have used it without issue for over three years now to buy bitcoins, but if don't want to use them there's plenty of other exchanges like Gemini, Bitstamp, Kraken, etc. 
Bitcoin works just like any other money, it's divisible and can be combined and divided, just like using pounds or dollars or whatever.
I'd highly recommend just downloading the wallet, checking it out, buying a small amount and see how it works for yourself. The best way to learn bitcoin is to use it!

It could be increased in the future, however, second layer scaling solutions like Lightening Network will allow for even smaller transactions beyond what we have now so I don't see it as ever being an issue.

You made an assumption that inflation is healthy which is debatable. 
You also presume that blockchain will decrease costs for banks when in reality blockchains are much more inefficient to maintain than a database which is all they really need. Blockchains are not meant as a cost saving measure, they're meant for censorship resistant transfers of value, that's the unique selling point for Bitcoin and why it's not going to die - there'll always be a need for these types of transactions.
In regards to it being to difficult to use, the same was said of the Internet in the early days. There's many companies and developers who are working on making it easier to use and it gets better and better every year, so I really don't see this as a big deal.

Well I always give it an upvote so there's one, and I imagine other folks around here recognize that this is a solid list of wallet recommendations as well.
Edit: I'll also add that even if it was a bot what does it matter so long as it's providing useful information related to the thread. I often hang out in the "new" section of r/Bitcoin and when you do you'll notice the same questions come up over and over again constantly, and one of those constant questions is what wallets to use, so it makes sense to me to automate this process.
There's lots of bots on Reddit, some provide useful information, and some of them suck. The good bots rise to the top and the bad ones get down voted. I don't see a problem with that.
So cut 'em some slack man, be nice to the bots because one day they will be our overlords.

There was a big discussion thread on the front page about it but it looks like it was deleted, probably because it has more to do with 'othercoin' than Bitcoin. Regardless, a rebranding and accepting another coin isn't really that big news unless you're an othercoin hodler.

The best option so far is but at the moment it still require some technical knowledge.
In the future JoinMarket will likely be built into different wallets so you can shuffle coins from within your wallet. [Samouari Wallet]( is working on this and will hopefully have that function available by end of November according to their product road map.

I think if you're just into Bitcoin to make a quick buck by trying to time the tops and bottoms of the market then you're going to have a bad time.
To me Bitcoin is about financial sovereignty, being in control of your own money. For me personally, I'm never selling my Bitcoins back into a fiat currency, the whole point is to use it AS a currency to buy goods and services with it at some point in the future.
That said, if you're interested in gambling with it, aka trading it, then check out the daily discussions in they talk about this stuff all the time, as well as lose money doing it.
@_date: 2016-10-07 18:47:40
Yes, I've bought instantly on Circle many times using a credit card and sent it to my own wallet right away.
As far as sending it to whoever you want, there are some restrictions in Circle's terms of service where they don't allow you sending it to places that might be used for illicit purposes like gambling sites or dark net markets.
It's best to use Circle just for buying and then immediately send them to a wallet where you control the keys before using it for transactional purposes.

The problem here is that you want someone to send you funds from an irreversible system (bitcoin) in exchange for funds from a reversible system (Paypal), thus it wouldn't even matter who went first because you could just get Paypal to reverse the charge and the other person is screwed; and it's for this reason that you'll almost never find people to take Paypal for Bitcoin.
Why not just pay cash using one of the following:
* [LocalBitcoins.com](
* [Any Bitcoin ATM](
* [LibertyX](

Love ChopCoin, one of my favorite bitcoin games. Have you guys considered creating a counterparty game token that can be used in game similar to what the Sarutobi and Spells of Genesis guys are doing?
Perhaps you have a token that gives some extra advantage if you hold it in your account, like for example, you have the ability to start each game with a little extra mass or something. And, perhaps down the road incorporate other games assets somehow, like use Sarutobi's ninja suit token to maybe increase your blob's seed a little. Oh man, I see all kinds of possibilities in gaming with these cross-game token assets.

As far as telling your parents, the best thing is to know what you're talking about so do your research first, then I think explaining it to them that you are interested in it as a learning experience in terms of personal finance and technology.

The explanation in the Bitcointalk thread made it sound like low risk due to the following:

Profitable bitcoin mining requires a lot of up front capital, specialized equipment, technical knowledge to set up, and a source of cheap or free electricity. Frankly, you'd make much more money if you just used that money and bought bitcoin outright and held on to it.
That said, if you insist on mining, check out the following beginner's guide in addition to the info at @_date: 2015-10-19 18:38:21
Check out [BitPay]( they do exactly what you're looking for.
@_date: 2015-10-28 21:56:37
First of all realize that Bitcoin is still a new technology, it's risky and volatile, so don't risk putting in more than you can afford to lose. Start small and learn how it works and then as you get the hang of it, you can put more or less in that you are comfortable with investing.
Second, trying to time the bottom and tops of the price of Bitcoin so that you can buy low and sell high is much more difficult than it looks. One only needs to read the daily threads at to see how badly people can predict these things.
If you believe that Bitcoin holds long term potential for success then it is likely the price will be higher in the future, so your best bet would be to buy some with money you don't mind risking and hold it for the long term, and hopefully watching the value continue to increase.
@_date: 2016-05-28 22:36:08
You could try a [Bitcoin ATM]( if there is one near you, or try [ChangeTip.com]( which lets you buy small amounts with just a credit or debit card.
@_date: 2015-10-27 06:16:59
It sounds like you might be better suited as a long term investor, of course that depends on if you believe Bitcoin will be successful and valued much more in the future.
If you're going to try to trade the short term ups and downs for profit then that is going to take some good knowledge of trading technique and analysis otherwise you'll likely lose money. If you're interested in that sort of thing then check out the daily threads, they talk about this stuff incessantly. 
My personal opinion is that technical analysis is basically just a crap shoot, better to look at the long term fundamentals instead and determine value based on that.
Good luck and may the moon be with you.

Here's a useful guide for mining:
Also check the sub, lots of info there.
That said, unless you have a few million to invest in an ASIC mining farm and access to cheap electricity you'll probably just end up losing money. You'd make more money if you just bought bitcoin outright today and held onto it for the long term.
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:16:24
Makes sense, I didn't really dig into the numbers, but I'm not really into mining anyways, more profitable just to buy bitcoin and hodl it.

It is possible to pay off more than the initial stock of money without printing more due to the the concept of Flow of money. It is explained nicely in the video example below:
@_date: 2016-10-03 03:23:18
The whole point of having money is to eventually use it to buy goods and services at some point in the future. So someone who has a lot of bitcoin will either eventually spend it back into the economy redistributing it himself or via his airs or if he/she dies without passing it along then those coins are lost and adds value to everyone else's coins.
I recall reading a research report some time ago that demonstrated that most family fortunes are completely redistributed back into the main economy within 3 generations. Obviously there are a few outliers of some famous families that manage to retain a large amount of wealth, but even those can get pretty diluted as the family expands. I really don't think hoarding is that big of an issue that people make it out to be.
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:06:10
Unless you have access to a chip foundry where you can make 12 nanometer chipsets to assemble your own ASIC then you're not going to be able to build a mining rig that is at all profitable, you'll lose money. You could buy an ASIC miner from China for around $1200 but even then you'll probably lose money.
If your goal is to make money I would just take that $1,000 and buy bitcoin directly, keep it safe in a wallet you control, and sit back as your investment increases over time.
If you insist on mining, I'd check out the subreddit, lots of information there.
@_date: 2017-05-04 00:13:23
Well I mean you kinda just shitposted for no particular reason, you didn't really present us with any kind of useful information so I'm not sure what you were expecting. If you input shit then you get shit output. If you needed to sell that's fine, I'm sure you had your reasons, but we don't need every damn bitcoiner creating a thread letting us know if they're buying or selling, kind of pointless and just clutters up the sub.

I believe they count as cash advances but it might depend on the card. I know one thing though, they definitely don't count towards getting points or cashback rewards.

Ah my mistake, that must have been the channel I was looking at, and yea I don't see people paying that much for those videos.

I would actually be more concerned that you are scamming people out of money by sending you Bitcoin then you go and reverse the Paypal transaction claiming you never got the Bitcoin - which is why people don't and shouldn't transact in the way you're asking. 
Either way someone got scammed here which should be a learning opportunity. And if you did send the Paypal without getting the BTC then you should file a complaint with Paypal and get it reversed.
Perhaps can comment on the situation?
If you want to buy Bitcoin, go through a legit broker:

Sheesh, it sounds like you're making this way more complicated than it needs to be. I'm not an expert on this stuff but you probably shouldn't be storing a copy of your private key in an unencrypted text file on your computer.

It's true they don't have scaling issues, but the point is that they're now ahead of the game and prepared for MASSIVE scaling if needed, in addition to fixing the maelibility bug, they can now innovate and progress further doing things like cross chain atomic swaps via Lightening Networks, and increasing privacy and fungibility, very exciting stuff, hard to believe that other people can't get behind such innovative progress.

Are you an experienced trader already? If not, what you are asking will be a learning experience and you will likely lose money in the process. If you're interested in pursuing 'trading' then check out as that is a more suitable forum for this stuff. However, my recommendation for making money in Bitcoin is to simply buy and hold on to it over the long term while the price continues to increase.
@_date: 2015-10-07 05:31:14
You can get setup with a wallet(s) by checking out this page:
Some wallets store the private keys on whatever device you're using which are considered under your control and some wallets store the keys for you. It's recommended to store your bitcoins in a wallet(s) in which you control the keys.
The best way to get started with Bitcoin is to use it! I recommend trying out a few different wallets and moving small amounts of Bitcoin between them. For instance you could have a mobile wallet like [Bread Wallet]( or [AirBitz]( as well as a wallet on your computer like [Electrum]( for example.
Most good wallets will have some kind of back-up options which could involve saving an encrypted file, writing down a set of phrases, etc. It's up to you to make sure you are familiar with your wallet's back-up procedure and that it's implemented.
In order to actually buy Bitcoin, there are different options which you can find here:
Coinbase.com, Circle.com, LibertyX.com, Bitquick.co, and LocalBitcoins.com are pretty popular and reliable options, although again, it's best to buy your bitcoins then move them to a wallet you control.
Here's a few bits to get you started down the rabbit hole :)
5000 bits
Once you get these in your ChangeTip account, try moving some of them to a few other wallets you've setup, that will help you understand better. Then once you get the hang of that, you could start checking out other nifty services like [Fold App]( [Purse.io]( or try winning more Bitcoin playing [Chopcoin.io]( for example... or sit on them and hopefully watch the price rise over time :)
Let us know if you have further questions.
@_date: 2016-05-29 19:51:38
First of all, when you say you have them 'sitting in blockchain', do you mean on Blockchain.info? If so, you may want to check that you can still access them and make sure you've backed the wallet up properly, as a lot of people have had issues with losing access to their bitcoin with them.
Second, I personally think that if you don't need the money, then you should hold on to those coins, there are a lot of reasons why the price might continue to go up over the long term. Yes, it's speculation, but the way I see it is that the upside potential for reward is far far greater than the downside risk... but that's just my opinion :)
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:43:00
While I suspect you are simply concern trolling, I'll answer your question. I can't speak for everyone on here but the general attitude here is support for MASSIVE scaling, sound code, and decentralization. 
Many people here support the core team since they have consistently put out well tested production level code that improves the network. In addition, their current Segwit code, once activated would not only provide a bump in onchain scaling but pave the way for many second layer scaling solutions which means massive scaling beyond VISA levels of transactions, along with better fungibility/privacy solutions. If you think this is anti-development then you're completely blind to what is happening in this space.
@_date: 2015-10-28 04:12:05
I've heard some have been able to with [Circle.com]( but it doesn't always work depending on the card but could be worth a shot.
Edit: You can also buy small amounts of BTC with [ChangeTip]( using a Visa card. Another option would be to use [Purse.io]( but you'll be paying a premium.
@_date: 2015-10-21 05:50:32
The easiest way to buy is from either [Circle.com]( [Coinbase]( or [LibertyX](
You may need to buy a dollar or two more than the purchase price of the item just to cover minor fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin to USD or CAD depending on how long you wait between buying the Bitcoin and sending them to the merchant.
It can be difficult to understand how all this works and really the best way to learn is to try it out with a small amounts of Bitcoin. Get yourself a mobile wallet like [Airbitz]( [Bread Wallet]( or [Mycelium]( Try transferring the bits I give you from ChangeTip to whatever wallet you setup and you'll start to get the hang of things. Let us know if you have further questions.

You could buy through [Purse.io]( using a gift card but you will pay a premium on the price of Bitcoin. Other than that you won't find any other reputable places to use a gift card due to KYC and AML laws. If you want to stay anonymous then the best way is to buy with cash using something like [Localbitcoins.com]( for example.
@_date: 2015-11-04 06:01:28
Nobody can tell you how to best invest your money. There are many around here who believe that Bitcoin will be a major disruptive technology and become widely adopted over the long term in many years, and if that is the case, the price of a Bitcoin will be significantly higher than it is now. 
So the question you need to ask yourself is do you believe in the long term potential of Bitcoin? If the answer is yes, then I think it makes sense to buy and hold over the long term, **just don't put in more money than you can afford to lose.**

The game is very similar to Agar.io in which it is a simple arena in which each player is blob in where you eat little pellets and other players to get bigger and bigger.
It takes a few games or ten to get the hang of it but it's pretty simple. You hit the space bar to split yourself and "w" to eject mass. Here's a pretty [decent guide]( that explains game play and strategy.
It's actually pretty addicting once you figure it out and with Chopcoin you can win Bitcoin if you get good at it. I'd recommend playing around in the Faucet playground which is free to learn the game if interested.

On top of the additional blockspace, it also fixes an important bug and enables second layer scaling that would massively increase Bitcoin's utility, this is far more urgent than simply kicking the can down the road with linear scaling.

It's the biggest and most secure blockchain. Also, don't underestimated the network effect; there have been other better competing technologies in the past that have lost out due to this - think TCP/IP and VHS for example.

Second layer scaling solutions like Lightening Network allow for you to make even smaller divisible transactions and since most people would be using that layer at that price level it wouldn't be much of an issue, in addition to the ability to make the base layer more divisible if needed.
@_date: 2015-10-16 20:39:57
You did everything right and getting the hang of it. Sometimes it can take a few minutes for a transaction to confirm, nothing to worried about, just give it around 10 minutes or so.
And yes, after each time Mycelium and most other wallets (called HD wallets) receive a transaction then there will be a new receiving address generated - this is perfectly ok and normal. The reason it does this is to help with privacy to lessen the ability for people to track your transactions. Also, be aware that any address generated by your wallet can be reused - so if Bitcoin was sent to the previous address you had again you will still receive those Bitcoin into your wallet, in fact, any Bitcoin sent to any address generated by your wallet you will get.
It takes some time to get used to but you'll get it. Surprisingly, no one has really created a non-technical step by step tutorial for actually using Bitcoin - think I might get on that :)

Well people buy because they think the price is going to be higher in the future, otherwise they'd be selling. My personal opinion is that the long term trend, over many years, the price will go up.

As reminder to everyone else, two often repeated mantras of this community:
* If you don't hold the private keys it's not your bitcoin (don't keep them on an exchange)
* Always backup your wallet and keep it in a safe place!!!

Just from looking at the link you posted, it appears you were banned for making personal attacks and generally being a disruptive member of that sub. You told a mod to kill himself, so I'm not too surprised that you were banned. Not exactly a productive conversation technique now is it?
In addition, the thread you posted was simply making assertions of fraud yet you provided no real evidence of any kind of conspiracy.
The drawing process does seem to be random and the way they use the blockchain for selection seems like a good approach. That said, I will admit there is potential for abuse with people submitting entries using multiple accounts, so that is a concern. Many people who do donate seem to accept that there is a downside risk but making some random person's life better outweighs the risks involved. Not to mention, no one is forced to donate; if someone wins and you don't think they deserve it or that the drawing wasn't "fair" then you don't have participate.

It depends on if you think bitcoin will be successful or even mainstream in the future, if so then the price will have to be much much higher than today, but of course we can't tell the future and we really don't know what'll happen, but many people buy and hold bitcoin for the long term thinking it will continue it's path of growth.
As for altcoins, those are much riskier, and while you could make a lot of money if you somehow manage to time it correctly, a lot harder than it looks, and avoid the ones that are scams. Really you should be researching things that you invest in otherwise you're just gambling.
My advice, do your research and if bitcoin looks promising to you then take a [dollar cost averaging strategy]( and hold for the long term.

Certainly valid points. So far, many of the DNMs have had centralized escrow which is a problem for those users, but I think that will be changing soon with things like what OpenBazaar is implementing which is more decentralized escrow systems.
You are right that centralized systems are most certainly easier to implement and run than decentralized systems, but is it better overall? To use an analogy, a dictatorship is much more efficient way to run a government, but wouldn't you rather have a democracy even if it's more complicated and not as efficient?

We gave you some sources the last time you posted this a few hours ago, did you look at that info?
Bitcoin is legal to transfer if the thing you doing is legal, which of course depends on the laws of the country you are in, but nothing is stopping you from doing a transfer since there are no third parties involved.
Also, it is not technically anonymous, it is pseudonymous, which means that it is possible to track transactions on the blockchain and find out who is involved if there is an identity that is somehow linked to one of the transaction addresses.
@_date: 2015-10-09 15:30:25
It's speculation no doubt, but it is not a complete gamble, not like spinning the roulette wheel. We can make an educated guess on where this whole thing is headed based on the increasing infrastructure, usage, and investments over the years, and based on that alone it looks very much like the early days of the Internet.
Yes, you could lose your investment and Bitcoin's value drops to nothing so you lose out on approximately $245 which is probably not a life altering loss - you'll still get by even as a poor 21 year old... however, if this thing does take off, the value of that 1 bitcoin will be vastly more valuable and you'll probably be able to retire early.
As I always say, the upside potential is far far greater than the downside risk. Just don't risk more than you can afford to lose. I think 1 Bitcoin is a good enough investment where if you lose it, it's not a big deal, but still a great hedge against the future of currencies.

Uhhh yea, it's easy to say this but it's another to actually be able to time the bottom and tops of the market.

Next you'll have to get some Pepecash to send to the wallet and use to buy the cards.
Edit: Apparently Pepecash isn't on Poloniex so I think you'd have to get it on the Counterparty DEX.

Which is why people need to start to think about how to earn bitcoin, aka offering their services in exchange for Bitcoin.

Aside from this being straight up theft, there's a bunch of problems with your plan. First, you'd never be able to buy that much Bitcoin on a credit card(s) in a short amount of time. Circle, which is one of the few places you can buy with a CC has a weekly limit of only $300, so it'd take a considerable amount of time to get up to $100k. 
Second, if you were to accumulate a large amount via CC, the banks which run those cards would likely start triggering all kinds of flags to which you'd probably end up on a bunch of watch lists by various government agencies. 
Third, since you are automatically giving your identity when purchasing something by credit card, it wouldn't be too difficult to trace your Bitcoin transactions through the blockchain - you'd have to go through a lot of effort to obscure de-link yourself from those initial entry points.
It's not a good plan, probably best to just earn your Bitcoins by exchanging your labor for it, the same way one earns regular fiat.

Indeed, this is what I always tell people, the upside potential is far greater than the downside risk, thus buying 1 Bitcoin could lose you around $290ish but the potential gain if this thing takes off will be significantly higher than it is now. Would people be willing to risk losing $290 if it meant that a few years from now that 1 Bitcoin is worth $3,000; $30,000; $300,000, or possibly $1 million?

Yes I suppose they could but I don't see why a member bank would want to sabotage their own blockchain and thus ruin the operation of their business.

It's easy to look back at history and retrospectively point out how foolish some people are for thinking that a certain invention/innovation would not work. However, we must remember that there are tons of inventions and innovations that end up going nowhere at all.
While I'm a big believer in Bitcoin, I'm also a realist and recognize that sometimes things don't work-out, regardless of how revolutionary you think something is.
I recall when the Segway first came out and people were clamoring on the bandwagon saying how it would revolutionize transportation and that cities would be redesigned to accommodate it...

I get the feeling you don't know what a blockchain is or why/how it's used... OnlyDomains is just a simple domain registrar that allows you to buy a domain and pay using Bitcoin, so I'm not sure why you keep saying you want a domain that uses blockchain? Also, what does it even mean to have 'blockchain look and spirit' lol...
Edit: and looking at that site further, it doesn't even look like it accepts Bitcoin, so it's just a regular old domain registrar as far as I can tell...

Regardless of the currency, the principles of accounting will always be useful in any capitalist society. Not sure why you'd assume using Bitcoin puts your accounting career in jeopardy.

Yes Breadwallet is very good and one of the most secure wallets. It is very easy to use and back up. When you install it you'll be given the option to write down a 12 word phrase - this is your backup and can be used to recover your funds if the phone is lost or damaged. And the great thing about the backup phrase is that you only need to do it once, that 12 words is forever tied with your private key, in fact you can do the backup before you even move any funds into it.

No I doubt it. What people seem to be complaining about is the delay of sending money between Coinbase and their banks on the **legacy payment network**, which is not unusual to take many days for transactions to clear and settle. For example, even non-Bitcoin companies like [Paypal take 3-4 days to settle a transaction]( when going from your Paypal account to your bank account, this is not unusual.

Some exchanges have something similar to this where you lend out your BTC to margin traders for a small percentage of 'interest' in return.

@_date: 2015-10-25 17:26:15
I think one of Bitcoin's weaker aspects is that it is not as fungible as other things like gold and cash. The definition of fungible is:


Since each Bitcoin has a unique path of transaction history and can be tracked this makes them less "indentical" and thus less fungible. Now if we can implement things like stealth transactions and built in coin mixers to wallets then that'd be a good step towards better fungibility.
@_date: 2015-10-28 16:53:19
I think a revenue sharing model is a step in the right direction but if you do it, you'll want to be incredibly transparent on the funds received and funds paid out to contributors (by posting the public storage address and payout transactions, otherwise be prepared for people to attack you on things like funneling coins to yourself for example.

Coinbase has already put out a statement saying they will not support the new altcoin and if you leave your coins on there then you won't get them, period.
Also, the hard fork does NOT double the bitcoin supply, Bitcoin (BTC) will still be capped at 21 million and the other separate chain which will not be compatible with bitcoin will have it's own supply of 21 million, the same way that other altcoins have their own non-compatible supply.
Please read the following to educate yourself:

No problem. Sometimes the transaction details can be tough to understand and I'm not that great at interpreting the details myself, but I suspect that the reason the larger 0.4895 amount is showing is probably due to how Romit is storing Bitcoin for it's users which is probably pooled in a single hot wallet. I wouldn't worry too much about it so long as the transaction went through as intended. That said, it doesn't sound like it's a good idea to leave too many Bitcoins on the Romit wallet as it appears they are controlling the private keys, best store your money on a wallet you control, like Mycelium for example.
Depending on the Bitcoin Kiosk or ATM, sometimes there is an option where you can deposit to your own wallet in which you'd hold up the QR code for a receiving address on your wallet to the Bitcoin ATM camera. If it doesn't have an option like that then you'll just have to use the Romit wallet as an intermediary for moving the coins.
While I'm at it, I just want to reiterate that it is important to back-up your Mycelium wallet. This way you can recover your funds if something ever happens to your phone, whether lost or damaged.

At this point you would see mass merchant adoption as that would be the better way to acquire Bitcoin, actually exchanging goods and services for it which people do value.

Beats me... if you need the money and are up in profit then maybe sell, but if you believe in the long term success of Bitcoin then the price will be significantly higher in the future in which case you should hold. Personally, I'm holding over the long term, as I don't think we've seen anything yet.

I may be wrong but I think the banks talking about implementing a blockchain is that their intention would be to have a private blockchain in which only participating member banks would be running nodes, so in that case a 51% attack wouldn't be possible since mining/running a node wouldn't be open to the public.

When you use a credit card you are by default giving up your identity to the merchant and you won't find anyone who will take a prepaid card for Bitcoin. If you actually care about being anonymous then you need to buy Bitcoin for cash using something like [LocalBitcoins.com](

It's a little more than a networked database. If you look in the actual bitcoin code Satoshi explicitly states that the blocks have to satisfy proof of work for hashing the transactions. Proof of work, which Bitcoin uses, is inherently expensive, just look at the costs and electricity requirements it takes to run all the miner farms.

It's a neat idea and a good way for noobs to earn a little bit of Bitcoin to play around with and get started.
A couple things though: 
* This needs to be more user friendly, the interface while there isn't much too it is a bit confusing. 
* The second sonic wall doesn't even open.
* The redemption process needs to be explained better. I went to redeem 2000 bits and it just said redeemed and nothing else, I have no idea how to actually get those bits, if at all, assuming this isn't just one big scam.
* It'd be nice if I could just enter a wallet address and you send the Bitcoin straight to that.
Edit: Just received email for the Bitcoin, although it was a little less than 2000 bits, I assume the transaction fee is taken out of one's earnings... again, this stuff needs to be explained in the app.

Well you can do direct deposit via [BitWage]( without the need of a bank so that's an option. However, as far as turning a check into Bitcoin directly, I don't know of any place that will do that. The best option would be to cash the check then use the cash for a [LibertyX]( or [Bitcoin ATM]( buy.

It sounds to me like you need to do some more research about Bitcoin before sinking money into mining which requires more technical knowledge along with a cheap source of electricity. As many others in this thread have said, if you're going "invest" in Bitcoin, you'd be better off just buying some actual Bitcoins and holding on to them and hopefully letting the price appreciate over time. Just don't invest more than you afford to lose.
Also, I'd like to point out that Bitcoin is not a company, it is a protocol, much the same way that Email is not a company but a protocol.

Might want to check out lots of good information over there on this topic.
Also, I might add that by the time you get your miner, set it up correctly, and then run it long enough to recoup the initial cost of the miner plus cost of electricity, you'll likely have lost out on tons of gains had you just used the $400 to buy Bitcoin outright and let it appreciate in value.

Agree that volatility is a problem and not good for the average consumer, but still think it's good for the average saver to hold a small amount of Bitcoin in case it does continue to climb higher as I think Bitcoin's upside potential is far far greater than its downside risk. Once someone's coins are more valuable than they paid for then purchasing goods or services becomes much more enticing I think.

Yes there were problems that preceded hyperinflation but that does not mean that a hyperinflating currency isn't bad - it's a huge problem for the people.

You'll probably want to get a mobile wallet on your phone which will make things easier usage wise, but I don't recommend Blockchain.info wallet. If you have an iPhone get [Bread Wallet]( if you have Android phone get [Mycelium](
Once you get one of those wallets setup, they will have a receive button which will give you an address you can send your Bitcoins to from your Romit wallet. I'm not familar with Romit wallet but I assume it has a 'Send' button somewhere in which you'd copy and paste the receiving address. This will move you coins from the Romit wallet to your other wallet.
Just be sure to double check that you copied the correct address before hitting the submit button. Also, make sure to follow the appropriate back-up procedures for either wallet which will include writing down a set of 12 words.
Hope that helps, let us know if you have additional questions.

Exodus is a great wallet that I've used personally; it's both easy to use, secure, and easy to backup, would recommend. Of course you wouldn't want it on an infected machine so being diligent with safe computing practices is always recommended. I'd say start with Exodus and get a feel for using the wallet, how it works, then as you learn more about cryptocurrencies you can always move on to a more secure setup if needed.

That said, Aug 1st is looking to be a non-event, and the only thing to be concerned about is whether or not you get an altcoin distribution afterwards. If you're on an exchange that supports it, then you'll get the coins, and if you're on an exchange that doesn't then you don't.

We will avoid a chain split and the UASF activation on August 1st won't matter anymore since segwit will be locked in. However, there is still a 2mb hard fork plan by the Segwit2x folks that is supposed to happen I think 3 months after segwit activation, but it's too early to tell if this will actually happen or not.

It's possible the price of bitcoin went down after you bought, you know the exchange rate in dollars fluctuates right? The real thing to look at is whether your amount of bitcoin you bought is the same or different. Regardless, we can't really help without more details of your situation.

Mining is a very difficult venture, and if you're new and lack the technical knowledge and don't have a source of cheap/free electricity, then it's going to be difficult to just break-even. You'd be far better off just using that money to buy bitcoin outright.
That said, if you insist on doing it, here's a decent guide:

Yes that is a possibility, but that is the reason why most wallets have the ability to be backed up, often with a very simple method of writing down a 12 word phrase which allows you to recover any funds in your wallet. The question you need to ask is if you trust the exchange to keep your Bitcoin safe more than yourself. Also, keep in mind that due to government regulation, exchanges will keep track of your transaction history and which addresses you are sending to.
If you're not familiar with the history of Bitcoin, be aware that it is not uncommon for exchanges to either get hacked and have Bitcoins stolen, collapse due to mismanagement, or completely disappear due to scam.
We have a saying in Bitcoinland - "If you don't control the keys, you don't own the Bitcoin"

Hmm, I think it's a fairly new wallet, it seems like it's probably fine but it's in no way the main wallet or anything official, in fact the owner of Bitcoin.com has been quite controversial lately and has different visions and ideas for bitcoin; not saying it's a bad or good wallet, but I personally would not use it.

Yes it should be fine.

Well you could hold it for the long term and hope the value of Bitcoin goes up or you could buy something else, like from Amazon via [Purse.io]( and get a pretty good discount for instance.
I always say that while [holding Bitcoin]( is speculation, based on my observtions of the growing Bitcoin ecosystem and investments into the infrastructure, I believe that the upside potential is far greater than the downside risk. Yes, you could lose $200 but it probably wouldn't negatively effect your life that much, however, if Bitcoin does take off than that $200 would likely be worth many times more than that. Would you risk $200 for a potential $3,000; $30,000; $300,000; or even a million dollar return 5-10 years from now?
@_date: 2015-11-09 20:05:57
That site is a known scam and as has been mentioned there were a number of these sites that popped up recently. I'm sorry to say that whatever Bitcoin you sent to them is gone for good, I hope it wasn't a lot.
For future reference you really need to do your homework and research on an exchange to find out if they're legit before sending them any Bitcoins. Sites that claim they will send you a Paypal payment if you send them your Bitcoin to sell are almost assuredly a scam site.
I'm curious why you even trusted this site to begin with?

I'm glad these scams are getting pointed out, but it amuses me when people think these types of returns are somehow portrayed as "conservative" or reasonable. The key word here is "daily"... not annual, but 3.6-4.8% daily! This is a ridiculous return considering it would come out to over 800% or so annual return, that indeed falls under the too good to be true instant riches category in my book.

They're almost certainly scams. A lot of these sites provide no information on who is running it, and promise these hourly or daily returns that if you actually calculated, it works out to hundreds or thousands of percent returns per year, which is a huge red flag - you know what they say about things that sound too good to be true...


Easy, they make money by suckering people into sending them Bitcoin and then they don't give it back.
If you want to actually make money by investing with Bitcoin, then just buy Bitcoin, hold on to it for a few years while keeping it safe and secure in a wallet you control, and out of the hands of scammers.

While Circle is great for buying Bitcoin, I wouldn't use it as your main transactional wallet when sending payments to vendors... especially if you're buying things that would throw up a red flag since Circle could cut you off if it thinks you are doing something illegal... thus, I'd recommend getting a wallet where you control the private keys like one of the following:
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)
* [Breadwallet]( (iPhone)
* [Mycelium]( (Android)
* [Copay]( (all devices)
* [Electrum]( (Desktop)
Essentially, you'd buy from Circle, send to your own wallet, then send to the vendor.

Electrum is a great wallet and does allow you to control your keys. Electrum basically gives you some seed phrases which is essentially your private keys in word form; this allows you to recover any funds in the wallet. You'll want to write those words down on paper and keep it in a safe place. NEVER enter those words/private keys to an online file.
I wouldn't recommend Blockchain.info wallet as they have a history of being unreliable and it's generally not a good idea to use a web wallet anyways.
Here's some other good wallet options if you're interest:
* [Airbitz]( iPhone or Android
* [Breadwallet]( iPhone or Android
* [Trezor]( Hardware
* [Ledger Nano S]( Hardware

Not just Lightening Network, but solving the transaction maelibility bug, which Segwit does, enables a whole bunch of new scaling tech like Schnorr signatures, MAST, Lightening Network, Sidechains/Drivechains, Tumblebit, MimbleWimble, etc etc.... the point is, solving this issue in itself is not the scaling solution, although it helps a little bit, but it DOES put us on the path to enable MASSIVE scaling beyond VISA levels of transactions making Bitcoin useful for the whole world to use, which I believe is a far more desirable roadmap than simple linear on-chain scaling which is only a temporary bandaid.

I think you make a good point here. A lot of Bitcoin advocates like to talk about how the unbanked, aka poor people, will be what drives Bitcoin.

I like the sentiment and the experiment but I don't think it'll work, I bet it'll actually make it worse.
Lets say I have something useful to tell everyone, like actual  good content but then you say, *"well listen buddy this community makes you pay to provide value to us."* After hearing this I'm thinking, *"these jerks want me to pay for providing this great content, no thanks."*
On the other hand if I was a spammer I'd look at this sub and say, *"oh hey, only 30 cents to plaster this place with my affiliate links and blogspam, what a great deal!"*
What I'm getting at here is that I think you have the model backwards. People who provide good content should be rewarded with Bitcoin and bad content should be penalized by detracting Bitcoin, something like [Sato.sh]( site is attempting to do, although still not clear how it's gonna work out.

* [Breadwallet]( (iPhone)
* [Mycelium]( (Android)
* [Copay]( (all devices)

Just make sure you follow the appropriate backup procedures for whatever wallet you choose.
Also, [Circle]( would be another good place to buy from but the same deal as Coinbase, use them to buy then transfer to a wallet you control for making payments. This way may help to avoid the more invasive questions required by AML and KYC laws.

Yes, reinstall a new breadwallet. Storing a digital screenshot of your passphrase on your computer or on the Internet somewhere is not safe. Keep in mind that anyone who has those 12 words would be able to access your wallet, so if someone where to hack into your computer or online account where those images are stored the wallet would be compromised.


I have it written down on paper and hidden in two locations, one in my home and another in a family members home. I've also managed to memorize it over time, so in a sense it's stored in my head.

Here's his criticism as transcribed from [this video](


Honestly the guy is being a bit vague here on what he thinks a currency should be - he says it should be backed by "the value of society, economy and humanity".... uhh ok great, but what the fuck does that even mean. It'd be useful if he gave us an example of his ideal currency. In addition, I wonder if he considers gold, which is just a hunk of metal, to be a currency?
I also wonder if he thinks other electronic protocols like http, tcp/ip, smtp, etc have any societal, economic, or humanitarian value? Bitcoin is a decentralized trustless network that allows people to exchange a token of value from anywhere in the world instantly, is he suggesting that technology doesn't provide any societal, economic, or humanitarian value to the world?
I don't think this guy gets it.

First time for me reading about the Miracle of Chile, very interesting stuff, and yes, I suspect was being sarcastic.
@_date: 2017-05-09 00:12:13
You'd earn way more money if you just use that $80 to buy some bitcoin outright and watch the price rise over time.
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:53:04
Well "get involved" can mean different things. Get involved with development? Get involved with the community? Get involved with content creation? Get involved with investing?
I suspect you simply want to buy some bitcoin. Coinbase is an easy option for buying some bitcoin from. While Coinbase has a built in wallet it's generally recommended that you not store them on Coinbase since they hold the private keys, thus you'd eventually want to transfer them to your own wallet. 
I'd recommend any of the following wallets since they are user friendly and have good security:
* [Airbitz](
* [Breadwallet](
* [Electrum](
Just be sure to follow the appropriate backup procedure for each.
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:04:36
The [Newcomer's thread]( is a good place to start.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:18:55
[Trezor has stated]( they will support a coin splitting tool in their wallet.
Other than that, I haven't seen any other wallet support it, so what you'd need to do is export your keys from a wallet you control and then import them into a new BitcoinCash wallet.
Another option would be to move your BTC to an exchange that supports coin splitting, but of course you have to trust the exchange to execute the split properly. Here's a list of what exchanges do and don't support this:
Edit - It appears Ledger will also support it.
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:16:37
I realize that Continue Mission is legit, but what is not necessarily legit is the website that you are accepting bitcoin for on behalf of them. There's no way for us to know that those funds will go to the actual charity and not to your own pocket. I mean, it's pretty sketchy dude...
How to make it more legit, I don't know, maybe just try to convince them to put up a donation address on their actual site and then send people there rather than a middle man site.
@_date: 2016-05-30 18:28:29
Yes we get it, people don't like Coinbase, so don't use them, pretty simple - enough with these hyperbolic shit posts.
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:50:30
This is a blatant SCAM - do NOT send them any Bitcoins!!
@_date: 2016-05-14 01:36:54
Probably depends on the machine, but I think some of them can print out a paper wallet for you which has the private keys that you can transfer to another wallet later on.
Check the following site for the BTM you want to use and look at the details page for that machine and it will usually tell you what you can do with it.
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:03:37
Yea I think Circle is probably your best option. You'll have to provide ID information to them since they have to comply with money transfer laws, but the process is rather straight forward and you'll be able to buy with a credit card if you want.
@_date: 2015-02-09 18:12:12
Email service that requires unsolicited incoming emails to pay a "postage" fee in bitcoin.
Basically it'd work like any other email program except you'd have a white list of specific emails and domains that are allowed to send to you free of charge, no hassle. Any incoming emails not on your white list get an auto-response or some other notification that to complete the delivery, a small fee is required to a particular bitcoin address that you own.
This would likely eliminate spam and unsolicited marketing emails, in addition, those that do get through, you'd at least be compensated for.
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:55:58


I'd highly recommend reading through the [Newcomer's thread]( lots of tips and information there.

Here's a list that shows which exchanges are and aren't supporting coin splitting and exchanging the new altcoin:
@_date: 2016-05-28 22:04:49
Ah yes, I think you are right, I'm just a bit on edge because I was just reading some very depressing articles on the situation in Venezuela. My apologies to if my comment came off as hostile.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:49:01
August 1st is basically a non-event at this point and your bitcoins will be just fine. That said, there is a new altcoin being created on that date in which holders of bitcoin will receive an equal amount of the new altcoin, depending on whether the exchange supports it or if the user has the coins in a wallet that they control the keys to.
Here's a good article that explains what's happening:
Also read this which is stickied at the top of the sub:

Lol, isn't it great how we're all coming together through our hatred :)
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:53:24
If that's the case then it might make sense to have your coins on Kraken assuming you trust them to execute the split properly.

@_date: 2015-10-31 18:48:16
You will still receive funds from any address your wallet generates, old or new, doesn't matter. So you can just post one of the addresses and/or QR codes that you've generated and you will still get all funds deposited to your wallet even if it's generated a new one.
@_date: 2015-10-06 21:50:15
Is it taking days for connecting with the bank or using a credit card? When I bought on Circle using my credit card it was almost instant.
@_date: 2015-10-16 22:18:04
I would try the following:
* [Circle.com](
* [Coinbase.com](
* [LibertyX](
Here's a more comprehensive list if the above options don't work for you:
Here's a few bits to get you started :)

Actually, it appears that they are moving forward with Bitcoin Cash regardless.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:34:36
Yea I don't see the correlation, it's more likely just traders taking profit after a historic run-up, which makes much more sense.
@_date: 2015-10-26 23:12:53
Well you could earn it the same way you earn any currency - by exchanging your labor, goods, and services for it. What do you specialize in, perhaps you can do some side work selling whatever it is you're good at for Bitcoin.
Check out the subreddit. You could also sell stuff on [OpenBazaar]( once it is released which should hopefully be within the next few months. There is also [Bitify]( which is an online auction place.
If you own a website that gets decent traffic you could use [Wiredup.io]( to earn Bitcoin through their advertising platform.
You could stream something for Bitcoin on [Streamium.io](
If you have any digital products like music or books or something you could sell them using [SatoshiBox](
Ever play Agar.io? Well you can win Bitcoin by playing a similar game called [Chopcoin.io](
There's all sorts of options if you have any value to offer people, the ~~sky's~~ moon's the limit man.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:38:55
No doubt traders will take profit after such a massive rise, that should be expected, but to say all the big players have cashed out is simply ridiculous conjecture.
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:35:43
@_date: 2015-10-20 17:48:38
Online wallets like Coinbase and Circle already have insurance setup for loss of funds similar to what you talk about. It sounds like you want to setup a private insurance company that deals strictly with the Bitcoin world. The thing is, as you mention, it'd require a sizable investment and I don't see why existing insurance companies couldn't just provide the same service since they're already very well versed in the business and have the capital for it too.
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:24:07
[Electrum]( would be a good option.
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:56:35
Just goes to show, if you try to time the market, you're gonna have a bad time.
@_date: 2017-07-21 06:49:55
Coinbase does act as a wallet to store bitcoins but they control the keys which is generally not recommended. You can find a bunch of wallets [here]( (stay away from web wallets), but I would personally recommend any of the following which you control:
* [Airbitz](
* [Breadwallet](
* [Electrum](
* [Trezor](
* [Ledger Nano S](

It'd probably be more difficult to use force and coercion to fund it (taxes) but it could certainly work if it were voluntary, in fact, I believe there were some subreddits dedicated to this exact idea, although not sure what the current status is.
Edit: Found the subs working on the idea of crypto UBI, though they don't seem too active anymore:
* * @_date: 2015-11-07 23:05:30
It'd be useful if you actually provided us with more information like what kind of operating system were you using, was it on a PC or Mac, how did you lose the password, anything to help us figure it other then "lost my password, please help." People can't just magically make them reappear, they actually need technical details.
@_date: 2015-10-18 19:24:28
Is he actually referencing fiat currency here? Could you provide a source for this quote so we can get some context? I suspect Saga was actually referencing religion and the like rather than the fiat system. I'm a big Sagan fan but have never heard him talk about monetary policy before.

Keep calm, as long you keep your bitcoins in a wallet you control then there's no need to get all worked up about all this stuff, just sit back and enjoy the ride.

Actually, I think this audience might be more likely to be small government, anti-Fed type folks than most other target markets, thus making Bitcoin an attractive proposition, so I could see this perhaps being an appropriate advertising campaign.
That said, I do agree that all of this advertising seems like a bit of a waste and not sure how much ROI they'll get on it even if the target market is appropriate. 
I think it'd make more sense to reinvest those dollars into developing more user friendly and **secure** products/services before trying to attract more customers.
@_date: 2015-02-03 04:03:35
Sweet, thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:10:25
That depends, do you want to sell it? If so then sell it, if not then keep it.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:12:40
There are a number of exchanges that will support coin splitting and will be listing the altcoin, see the following list:
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:01:44
Shit man, there's enough material in Bitcoin's history for a full on HBO/Netflix series.
@_date: 2016-05-12 16:43:39
No they don't. Most places won't take a prepaid card due to AML and KYC laws.
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:51:37
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:48:44
No you would need a multi-currency wallet. Check out [Coinomi]( or [Exodus]( but you could also just keep them in their respective wallets.
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:05:32
Meh, do they really need a token for this though, seems like just another ICO scam.
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:34:52
I assume you meant BCH not BTH?
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:35:29
It's probably different for different people, but I would say if you had more than $5000 worth, or 2 or more bitcoin, then it's time to consider a hardware wallet, but that's my personal opinion.
Airbitz can be pretty secure though, especially if you enable the built in two factor authentication which is highly recommended. That said, I've never heard anyone losing bitcoin from an Airbitz wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-08 04:06:08
Only the public key is shown in the picture and thus people can only send money to the address not receive. They'd need the private key which the OP claimed was printed on the back to sweep the funds out.
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:12:51
You'd think they'd add the QR code image to that to make it easier to scan and send donations with a phone wallet.
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:52:28
* [Circle.com](
* [BitQuick.co](
* [ChangeTip.com](
* [Bitcoin ATM](
@_date: 2017-07-07 15:32:42
For phone wallets I'd recommend either of the following as they provide good usability, good security, and you control your private keys:
* [Airbitz](
* [Breadwallet](
@_date: 2015-10-24 20:09:31
Eh, don't bother wasting precious bits on this clown.
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:20:51
You'll pay whatever the price is at the time of purchase, so if you bought a bitcoin for $2000 then that's the price you pay and what is transferred.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:07:56
Ethereum has far far worse scaling issues than Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:09:10
I've never even heard of the Bitcoin.com wallet so I really don't know.
@_date: 2016-05-24 17:07:43
Even if you did get your payment, which I'm skeptical of, I still wouldn't trust that site with a 100 foot pole. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:08:18
Some buy it as a speculative investment, some buy it to buy things they normally couldn't with fiat money, some buy it simply because it's easier to move between countries (capital flight, remittances, etc), and some buy it simply for political reasons.
Whether you want to buy bitcoin is up to you. I'd recommend reading through the [Newcomer's thread]( to get a better understanding of what it is first, and see if it's something you're interested in.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:55:48

He's 17 they won't let him buy yet until he's 18.
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:10:56
The two aren't really compatible in terms of wallet recovery, however I believe it is possible to extract private keys from Airbitz and then import them to Electrum, although that is not advisable for security purposes.
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:55:05
Well it'd be a lot easier to have everyone using bitcoin if we could have second layer scaling that'll allow MASSIVE throughput that will enable the world to use bitcoin. We'd be on our way to Roger's vision if we could just get Segwit activated. This guy's logic is so frustrating.
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:53:39
The problem is nobody really knows what is going on or how the split will play out and whether or not supporting the new one will be safe, so it's really in the exchanges best interest to take a 'wait and see' approach.
That said, if you really want both coins then you should keep your bitcoin in a wallet that you control the keys to, and at which time the split happens, there will likely be plenty of guides to help people figure out how to access and move the new coins.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:27:33
You need the actual hardware wallet to use it.
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:51:15
I believe the following work for Sweden:

If you're able to accurately predict the rise and fall of Bitcoin prices then you certainly wouldn't need to sell the software for $65 a pop; if what you're saying is true then you could be rich just from trading on these predictions.
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:23:44
You can sell it on places like [Localbitcoins]( or [Paxful]( at a premium over the exchange prices, so that's an option.
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:05:31
Not true, if you open a LN channel then you can send an LN transaction on testnet.
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:14:00
I'd recommend [Electrum]( as they will support and make it easy for users to access and send forked coins and is a lot easier than setting up a secure paper wallet.
@_date: 2015-11-25 17:51:02
**This site is obviously a SCAM, do not send any Bitcoins to them.** Considering the age of the OP's account, only a few hours, this whole thread is a setup to promote this scam site.
Mods please remove thread and the comment above.
Edit: This is a very similar site to other scams that have been removed in the past few weeks such as:
* btcto.money
* bitcoinltd.net
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:49:20
The best way to get started in my opinion is to setup up a few different types of wallets and practice sending small amounts of bitcoin between them. Setup a ChangeTip.com account for one type of wallet which conveniently connects to your Reddit and other social media accounts. Also get a mobile wallet if you have smartphone, [Mycelium]( if you use Android or [Bread Wallet]( if you use iPhone are the recommended choices.
Let us know if you have any questions or need help with anything.

@_date: 2017-07-24 19:25:35
OP was asking for wallet advice not another exchange. Localbitcoins controls the private keys of coins on their site and it's not recommended you leave bitcoin there, the same as any other exchange.
@_date: 2017-07-21 07:10:46
The Bitcoin protocol is on track to achieving scaling consensus solution and the price is reflecting that good news.
Whether you should invest or not is up to you, we can't tell you what to do with your money, I'd recommend doing some further research and figure out if you think Bitcoin will be successful in the long run and if you do then buy some, but not more than you can afford to lose.

I guess you need to ask yourself why you got into this in the first place, was it because you wanted to "get rich quick" or do you believe Bitcoin has a successful future?
Just six days ago [you said the following](


So I imagine you believe in the technology or your mind is easily swayed, I don't know. That said, you can deduct losses on Bitcoin if you sell it since it's considered a commodity by the IRS, but I'm afraid I don't know the details on how to do it since I'm a long term holder kind of guy.
Best of luck, whatever you do.

Yes excellent point which I didn't bring up, but one only needs to look at other currencies from the past that aren't necessarily "backed" by anything like beads, shells, or those giant stone disks from the island of Yap. Surprising that Ratigan hasn't figured out the ledger thing yet.
@_date: 2015-02-18 17:26:52
I believe that is possible depending on the bank and is just a matter of calling them to request that option, although I'd assume most banks would make this difficult since it is more profitable for them to allow people to overdraft so they can collect the fees.
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:08:13
I was asking for name of the Bitcoin wallet you were using as to better ascertain what the problem might be. For example, are you using Mycelium, Breadwallet, Electrum, etc...
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:23:40
[Airbitz]( lets you set a custom fee.

Your Circle account might have it's currency set to dollars instead of Bitcoin. What you'll need to do is go to the 'settings' section which is in the drop down menu where your name is, then click on the 'currency' tab. This will show you what your currency is denominated in and let you convert it to Bitcoin. Hope that helps :)
@_date: 2017-07-19 06:52:31
If you have the backup phrase it provides then you'd be able to recover them with another wallet.

They split up. Check out [Junseth's World]( for the forked version.
@_date: 2017-07-13 20:32:44
It's not a scam, but it's not really relevant to Bitcoin anymore since they stopped selling it and using it.
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:50:47
Yea Mycelium should be fine too, I just wouldn't make any transactions during a split event.
@_date: 2016-05-26 21:22:28
You could try [Bitsquare]( although it's still in beta... I think.
Regardless, you're going to pay a higher rate for more decentralized anonymous methods simply due to lower liquidity and the fact that the exchange methods involved tend to be more of a pain in ass thus the sellers will want more compensation for the effort.
If you want cheaper rates that are close to the spot price on the big exchanges, then you'll need to buy from a broker like [Circle]( or [Coinbase]( or buy from an actual exchange.
You could also try [LibertyX]( which I think is 1% fee, or find a cheap [Bitcoin ATM]( which will have varying fees depending on the ATM.
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:26:41
It depends on what you think the long term success of bitcoin looks like. If you think it'll succeed in the long run and gain wider adoption, then the price is probably still cheap right now and will have to be much higher in future, years from now. However, if you're just here to gamble on short term price swings then you'll probably have a bad time.
@_date: 2015-02-28 00:07:20

Unless Kraken gets hacked then you're probably fine and will still have your bitcoins. The only thing that will be up in the air is whether or not you get the new altcoin which is unclear that Kraken will support it or not. Otherwise, Aug 1 is just a non-event.
You're in luck, Kraken just made an announcement saying they will support the new coin.
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:26:12
Indeed, with all the recent news, that type of service will be much needed/in-demand.
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:24:16
Any of these are good options:
* [Gemini](
* [Bitstamp](
* [Kraken](
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:07:54
If you believe in Bitcoin's long term prospects then just hodl on to it for the long term, otherwise if you're trying to time the markets on short term swings you'll most likely get rekt.

* [LibertyX]( for cash
* [LocalBitcoins.com]( best option for anonymity
* [Any Bitcoin ATM]( for cash
@_date: 2015-10-14 16:12:55
Yes I think that's the point people are making as to why the initial volume was so low, because it's due to the slow ass legacy banking system of transferring funds into the exchange.

I think Electrum supports replace by fee so you could just do that.
Also, you could try the Bitcoin Afterburner service that the Samourai Wallet guys put out:
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:38:35
The Mycelium wallet is probably still fine to use, but I don't recommend it anymore due to the turmoil of the company, devs leaving them, and it's CEO involved in some scammy ICO practices. Based on that, I don't really see the wallet being supported and developed in the future so it doesn't make sense to me to have people keep their coins on there.

I think it's more of a case study on people who don't actually read the articles before commenting on them.
@_date: 2015-10-09 15:58:25
It's possible but as you say, there are a lot people invested in this so probably not, which is why my educated guess is that it will continue to grow along with the price. That said, something like a fatal flaw in the code that is found or something vastly better that comes along to dethrone Bitcoin could likely send it to next to zero.

Welcome. You should read through the [Newcomer's Thread]( that is conveniently stickied at the top of the sub, it will answer a lot of your questions along with how to buy bitcoins.
Also, check out these resources:

I'm not familiar with CampBX but most if not all exchanges have an option to directly withdraw Bitcoin to your own wallet. I'd poke around the interface a bit to see if you can find it, but it's typically just a matter of entering the receiving address of your personal wallet and clicking some kind of withdraw button.
@_date: 2016-05-31 18:05:25
Decentralized exchanges are much more difficult when dealing with the legacy banking system, although software like [Bitsquare]( are working on it, but I doubt it'll replace the efficiency of a centralized exchange, but could certainly be a better option for crypto to crypto trades.
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:51:07
Most wallets, including mycelium, will have an option to export your private keys, which you can then import to another wallet. Also, if you're using Mycelium than you can just use your 12 words to get your BCC coins in the BCC Electrum wallet once that's released.

The problem with using Reddit and other social media sites as news sources is that it's just as bad or worse than regular media since you still get a tremendous amount of noise, clutter, trolls, misleading headlines, and other garbage to sift through in order to find the real news. And while I'm not usually a fan of crypto news sites, a small number do a halfway decent job at summarizing the daily crypto happenings like Coindesk.com which is probably the better of the crypto "news" sites.
@_date: 2017-07-14 15:49:25

Yes they're fine on Airbitz, just don't make any transactions in the event of a chain split, which is looking unlikely to happen now anyways, so you should be fine.

I think in a "mad max style collapse" an electronic currency dependent on a vastly interconnected communication infrastructure would be pretty worthless.
Gold I think would also be overrated, why would anyone want a hunk of metal when they're more concerned about food and survival.
Food, fresh water, guns and ammo; definitely solid investments for surviving the apocalypse.
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:57:33
Yes, Electrum is perfectly fine. I believe the BCC folks are working on an Electrum version for their coin so splitting them shouldn't be too difficult.
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:44:55
It sounds like you don't know where they're stored, which you need to figure out if it's on an exchange or in a wallet. I'd recommend seeking out someone you trust that knows about Bitcoin and can help you out, you seem to be pretty much out of your league here.

You're still good for another 16 hours or so, just be sure to use a high enough fee that it'll go through in that amount of time.
@_date: 2015-10-20 03:19:04
Well 1% is already pretty cheap compared to a lot of other options, however, [Circle.com]( doesn't technically have any fees if you buy through your bank account but I've noticed the buy prices tend to be slightly higher than Coinbase.
Also, here's a useful site/tool you can peruse to do a little more research on what you're looking for:

It might be possible but it'll probably be quite complicated since Coinbase isn't supporting it. If you want UAHF coins then you'd be much better off having your coins in something like [Electrum]( before they fork off.

Recognize that transaction fees paid to miners are different than fees Coinbase charges for doing business with them, Segwit has no impact on the later.

Good on them, would like to see more Bitcoin services take up a similar stance.
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:25:55
At this point the only thing you need to do is make sure you control the keys to your coins, so if you're using Jaxx then you should be good. Once the new coin actually happens after Aug 1st then there'll be more information, hopefully, that'll show you what to do.

@_date: 2016-05-29 19:30:53
Not bad, but not really my cup of tea as far as artwork goes, and certainly not in my price range.
However, here's a few suggestions to maybe help you sell some work for Bitcoin.
1) Nowhere on your site does it advertise that you accept Bitcoin, with the exception of the checkout page. Stick that right on the front page and next to the prices of each work. It's not too hard to find a Bitcoin accept logo somewhere.
2) If you value Bitcoin more than Dollars then perhaps offer a discount, like 20% off if they pay in Bitcoin. With the recent price rises lately, a piece bought at a discount last week would already be worth more than one bought in dollars.
3) It's still complicated at the moment, but you could try to create an OpenBazaar store and list your pieces for sale there.
Good luck!
@_date: 2016-05-05 23:57:21
Yes you can, just go to the 'withdraw' section and enter the address you want to send to.
@_date: 2015-11-11 00:14:42
If you believe that Bitcoin will be successful in the long term, over the next several years, then the price will be much higher than it is now in which case you should just hold on to your investment. Of course you should never invest more than you are willing to lose.

Hard to say, it could just be trying to sync with the blockchain since you haven't opened it in awhile, not sure. Regardless, keep those 12 words safe since those are the keys to getting your funds back if you can't get the wallet to work.

Yea, I don't think I buy into the 'wisdom of the crowds' thesis. One only needs to look to Reddit as an example of how the crowd is usually just a bunch of pitchfork wielding followers. There are consistently misleading and factually inaccurate stories that are highly upvoted, constant witch hunts, people who only read headlines and not articles, and lets not forget that whole Boston Marathon bombing fiasco.
Most people don't actually do their own basic research and apply critical thinking and skepticism. The crowd is not 'wise', the crowd is just a brainless mob.
I could see this whole TheDAO thing ending in disaster, although it'll certainly be an interesting experiment.

Yes there are transactions on the first few of the first page of that site because people sent small amounts to those addresses for the lolz after the site had been publicized. However, if you pick a random page and go through all the addresses after the first few pages you'll notice all of them are 0 balance and 0 transaction history, like this one for example:
Again, you've proved nothing here other than your ability to look up publicly available private keys, but for you to actual take funds from any of them would take you a million years before you found one.

You could earn it buy offering your services in exchange for Bitcoin, at Also there are some apps for your phone which you can earn Bitcoin by watching advertisements, downloading apps, or filling out captchas.

 A lot of people get caught up on this "Intrinsic Value" thing, even folks like Peter Schiff who I tend to agree with on other economic views.
said this was his defininition of intrinsic value and gave an example as follows:


Based on his definition I would say that Bitcoin's intrinsic value lies in the peer to peer network's ability to transfer ownership of a token across the Internet to anywhere in the world near instantly at little to no cost without the need of a third party outside the control of governments and banks. This in itself provides the "utility" he speaks of, and of course this only really works with the Bitcoin token as an incentive - there's your value.

You pay the price at the time of purchase, when you click the buy button, in fact they'll give you confirmation receipt showing the price you pay for it.

First of all I don't condone money laundering or anything illegal... but if I were going to tumble coins, and this is just a thought experiment not advice, I'd probably use Monero to do it, something like this:
Bitcoin wallet  -&gt; Shapeshift -&gt; Monero Wallet -&gt; Shapeshift -&gt; Bitcoin wallet 
It also might make sense to use a vpn via the shapeshift process, in addition bitcoin wallet  must never ever receive coins that are directly from an exchange or service that's tied to identity, only for tumbled coins.

While it might not be your money, if you make this agreement, it will most certainly be YOUR liability. If I'm reading this correctly, you are basically guaranteeing him a 200% return on his money?! I'm sorry, but that is absolutely nuts. As others have already said, this is no different than a loan except with a far far worse interest rate for you.
Look, if you want to sell him some Bitcoins in exchange for USD then fine, but do not guarantee him a return on the money, especially if you want to remain friends, because someone is in this deal (likely you) is going to get screwed.
@_date: 2015-02-18 17:18:20
Cryptocurrency would certainly help in a speedier payment system, however, I'd say overdrafts are more a failure of the current generation of people who don't budget/reconcile their expenses. 
In the olden days when people used checking accounts and before online banking, one had to regularly "balance" their check book in order to determine if they had funds in their account BEFORE spending money, thus preventing overdrafts. These days people wrongly think that logging into their online bank to check their balance constitutes proper budgeting when it does not.

It depends on if you think bitcoin will be successful or even mainstream in the future, if so then the price will have to be much much higher than today, but of course we can't tell the future and we really don't know what'll happen, but many people buy and hold bitcoin for the long term thinking it will continue it's path of growth.
My advice, do your research and if bitcoin looks promising to you then take a [dollar cost averaging strategy]( and hold for the long term. 
Also, don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

I think it actually makes sense to sign up to multiple exchanges so that you have the options to quickly sell in the event that one or more of them is down (like GDAX often is). I have accounts on GDAX, Gemini, and Kraken; all verified and leveled up - why not have more than one option to exchange.

It's generally recommended that you don't keep money on an exchange, better to keep on a wallet you control that is secure and properly backed up. Electrum is a good choice so long as your computer stays free of malware and other malicious programs. Otherwise, if you're planning on actively trading with it, then it makes sense to keep whatever amount you're trading with on the exchange.
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:34:46
All value is subjective and right now people are willing to exchange approximately $8000 worth of value for it. Not only are they willing to exchange other currencies for it but they will also exchange goods and services for it. 
In my own experience I've been able to buy a new TV, a couch, computer hardware, and pizzas in exchange for Bitcoin, so clearly it does indeed have value to some people.
You can drone on about tulips and intrinsic value all you want, but we don't give a shit, we're the ones who use it, hold it, and give it value. Bitcoin doesn't care about your idiotic opinion, it's been plugging away for over 10 years now and it'll keep on going.

Keep in mind that these types of flash crashes happen all the time in Bitcoin, particularly during bull runs. Just look at the charts during past run ups and you'll see plenty of these kinds of sell-offs, but the price eventually recovers and continues the climb.
Of course it sucks seeing the price crash, that's just part of the deal. If it's money you can afford to lose, it might be worth holding it, or at least some of it for the longer term.

I've been buying from them regularly for well over 3 years now and have never had any issues at all and of course I don't leave my coins on there, I send them to my own wallet that I control as soon as possible. That said, it does seem like there have been many people who have had bad experiences in terms of customer service and transactions being cancelled, so if that's a concern then just use another exchange, of course they're all under a lot of strain just from the loads of new people coming into this space.

Yes, that's a good point, obviously if you need to keep opening and closing channels to top up funds, then that could be problematic if on-chain fees are really high, however, LN devs are working on a concept called 'splicing' which will allow you to top up funds on a channel without having to close and open a new channel, so this would mitigate that concern and could potentially allow you to use an open channel indefinitely.

I'm not sure the ability or ease of transferring a money has to do with fungibility, and while that is certainly a very good selling point for Bitcoin, there is still people discussing the concept of "blacklisting" Bitcoins that are involved in illicit activity and to me that is very much opposite of fungible. If a merchant can block my Bitcoin payment because some of those Sathoshis are connected to illegal behavior then those coins are not interchangeable and not treated the same as other "clean" Bitcoins.

I suppose that's possible, but what I've been observing from these types of complaint threads is that usually someone from Coinbase comes along, reviews the order, and determines it was a mistake, and puts it through after the fact. This leads me to believe there are certainly false positives that occur under Coinbase's automated system to determine what people are or are not risky clients. Now how the manual reviewers make these determinations apart from the automated system is unknown, but whatever their method, it would make sense to simply have them actually review the flagged orders before notifying the customer of cancellation.

I think the issue is it depends on the value of the Bitcoins you purchased at that are sitting in your wallet, otherwise in order to avoid volatility in purchasing power you'd have to buy the bitcoins at time of purchase then send them to Fold then buy your coffee... which is a bit more complicated. That said, if the bitcoins you are holding have increased in value than yes simply importing your wallet coins to Fold.app would be fairly simple and likely save more than 20% off your purchase.

Electrum is an SPV wallet so you don't need to download the blockchain, it's very quick to get setup and running. As for using it on a new computer, that seems a bit overkill to me. The regular security settings on Electrum, perhaps even using the 2fa is probably good enough so long as your computer isn't infested with tons of malware. That said, if you think you can securely setup and handle a paper wallet then go for it.

I'd go with either [AirBitz]( [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( - all of which have good reputations for both security and usability, you control the keys, and all allow the ability to import or sweep private keys.

I very much doubt he said he would invest in any cryptocurrency as it is very well known that Buffet only invests in things he understands and admits himself that he doesn't understand tech and doesn't invest in it.
As far as STEEM goes, it is only traded on one exchange right now with very low transaction volume so it's no surprise that the marketcap, which is not a great way of measuring a coins value, is so high right now. In addition, the system is very complex and has many elements of a multi-level marketing scheme. It's an interesting project though, but I wouldn't be celebrating its success so soon.

This is typical behavior for Bitcoin, we often see very big rises and very sharp drops. The trick is to not get emotional about it and hold on for the long term, of course this assumes that you believe in Bitcoin's long term success over many years in which case the price will need to be significantly higher than it is now. If all you're doing is trying to make a quick buck by timing the market then you will likely be in a world of pain.

Yea the guy is purposely vague in his predictions and timelines, he's basically a modern day Nostradamaus where if you throw enough broad and probable predictions against the wall something will eventually stick and he gets to claim he's right regardless of all the things he gets wrong.
A good example is that he often predicts some sort of natural disaster but the thing is, there are natural disasters every year. Another example is that he often predicts large scale riots, but there are always some large riots or demonstrations going on somewhere in the world at least once a year. The point is, it's not hard to predict things that we know already happen with some frequency.

Both of these are good for iPhone:
* [Bread Wallet](
* [AirBitz](
The difference between these and an online wallet like Coinbase is that you control the private keys and thus the Bitcoins can not be confiscated. That said, it also means you are responsible for the security of your coins by making sure you follow the appropriate backup procedures for whatever wallet you use. If your phone gets lost, stolen, or damaged and you don't have anything backed up then the coins are lost for good.
Hope that helps :)

If you're buying as a long term investment then now is as good a time as any. If you're just doing short term gambling, then you may want to check the daily discussions at and see what the sentiment is. 
Trying to time the market rarely works out and you just end up panic buying or panic selling. The better approach would be to simply [dollar cost average](

Well for me personally, I own a Trezor which will have a coin splitting tool, and will allow me to send my BCC to an exchange while keeping my BTC safe on the Trezor; so that's what I'm doing.
That said if you don't have a Trezor or Ledger, and if you really want to sell off your BCC, and don't want to deal with the process of exporting/importing private keys between wallets, then it might make sense to move them to an exchange like Kraken or Bitfinex and let them split the coins for you which you can proceed to dump, although this means trusting the exchange with your bitcoin and that they'll execute the split properly.

Bitcoin has a unique advantage over centralized payment processors and that's censorship resistance, that's the unique selling point, not low fees.

It doesn't matter where the bitcoins are stored, the price for those bitcoins is whatever the market price is that you would buy or sell them. The value of something is simply whatever someone is willing to pay for it - doesn't matter where you keep it.
Think of it this way, are dollars valued differently if they're in the bank or in your wallet? A one dollar bill is still worth one dollar regardless of where it's stored.

I don't have a top 10 list or anything but the main reasons people use Localbitcoins is for more anonymity, likely because they are using the bitcoin for illicit activities or they're paranoid about governments/banks; otherwise you are right, it is easier and cheaper to go through an exchange so long as you're ok with giving your identification information to them.
Really it just comes down to either what you're using the bitcoins for or your trust/distrust of the "system"

I honestly don't think they're that bad, I've been using them for over 3 years now, buying on a regular basis, and have yet to have one single problem with them.
I suspect that a lot of these complaints crop up because people are either impatient not understanding that Coinbase is using the legacy financial system to go from USD to BTC in addition to all the government compliance; or people do idiotic things like send bitcoin directly from their coinbase wallet to a gambling site, or dark market, or other exchange.

Uh, it's not an insignificant amount. If we assume similar revenue this year, lets say $3 billion then this would account for a approximately 25% loss just in one quarter.

While I'm not a fan of Larry Summers, he is a pretty influential person in both politics and economics, so just the suggestion of him saying that Bitcoin is a useful technology should help in acceptance amongst mainstream wall street types.
I also somewhat agree with his sentiment on shedding the "hyperlibertarian aura" as some of things I've read from the libertarian anarcho-capitalist crowd can seem a bit over the top and sound like some crazy nutter scheme. Not that I don't disagree with many points of libertarianism but I'd much prefer that Bitcoin enthusiasts focus on the practicality of the technology than some idealogical fantasy.
Pragmatism is the best approach to most issues in my opinion.

No, it seems easy in retrospect, but trying to time the market and make predictions is harder than it looks. You also need to consider that there are additional costs associated with fees and taxes on capital gains so you need to make enough to cover the costs and still be profitable.

It is not uncommon for people just learning about or joining a new type of movement to have this sort of superiority complex over other people, and based on the amount of circlejerking around here I'd say it definitely isn't "just" you.
The problem is, it is still important for you to take a step back every once in awhile to question your current beliefs. Remember the people who get caught up in crazy schemes and cults tend to also have this type of "red pill matrix" feeling; consider the most recent Paycoin scam as a good example, or any religion for that matter. Now I'm not saying Bitcoin is a scam, just saying don't be a mere follower, always ask questions, especially when people start talking about grand ideologies... sometimes you have to ask yourself "am I really leaving the matrix" or just entering a delusion?

Yes it's legit, most licensed exchanges need this information to comply with the AML/KYC regulations, the same as signing up for a bank account or credit card.
There's ways to buy it more anonymously but it costs more and is a bit more complicated.

August 1st is basically a non-event at this point and your bitcoins will be just fine. That said, there is a new altcoin being created on that date in which holders of bitcoin will receive an equal amount of the new altcoin, depending on whether the exchange supports it (Coinbase doesn't) or if the user has the coins in a wallet that they control the keys to.
Here's a good article that explains what's happening:

While I agree with your title, I don't necessarily agree with the above statement. People should at least do some research in the proper best practices for securing your own Bitcoin and which wallets/methods to use BEFORE getting them off the exchange without knowing what you are doing.
I'm not a fan of exchanges like Coinbase, but they are better than storing your Bitcoin in a hapless, reckless, careless way like [the guy from this recent post]( who did almost everything wrong and lost $170 grand worth of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-14 22:06:04
This is an excellent point that I hadn't even considered but yes, there is no way they'd get a top ranking in google for "yours" since it is currently all mostly dictionary definitions and likely hard to outrank anytime soon.

The mempool is pretty low now so you could get away with a low fee like 1-2 sat/byte; of course it depends on the urgency of the transaction, if you need it to go through right away then maybe bump it up a bit.

@_date: 2017-06-09 19:13:26
Buying bitcoin is the same as investing assuming you're holding on to it and not spending it or losing it.
As for whether you should buy, we really don't know and can't make personal financial decisions for you - you need to do the research and figure out whether or not you believe bitcoin will be successful for the long term and whether or not you can avoid panicking during volatile price swings, both up and down. If Bitcoin is successful in the long term then the price will have to be much much higher than it is today and many people around here believe that, but it could also be worth nothing too. 
The general rule of thumb around here is don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

I honestly don't think it's that deep, if people would just transfer from the broker/exchange to their own wallets first then most of these cases could probably be avoided.
The one similar case posted recently which is probably the same customer you're talking about sent directly from Coinbase to Bitbet and then wrote "bitbet" in the memo section... oy vey... no wonder they shut him down. People need to think a little bit more when doing something illicit.

Not really, transaction fees for 10-20 sat/B are going through in other wallets just fine, the issue IS with Mycelium's fee estimation algorithm and lack of custom fee option.

Excellent analysis, thank you for providing a well thought out explanation on your price forecast.  
@_date: 2016-07-01 15:27:01
Since Bitcoins don't earn interest there wouldn't be compounding, just fluctuation in value, so all you'd do to factor this in is add whatever percentage fee to the dollar costs spent on Bitcoin in the above chart which wouldn't be a huge difference.
@_date: 2017-06-28 07:22:34
The common advice is that you don't keep Bitcoin on an exchange, however keeping fiat money there is probably fine since that is less likely to get hacked/stolen. In addition, most exchanges let you buy bitcoin even while the bank transfer has yet to settle, you just won't be able to withdraw your bitcoin until the transfer has cleared.

You're talking about trading and Coinbase isn't really meant for that, it's a broker service and you'll lose a lot in fees and spread - you'd want to sign up for an exchange like GDAX, Gemini, Bitstamp, or Kraken; then you'd be able to do what you describe.

The article is quite uninformed as it suggests that Bitcoin mining on GPUs is still feasible. The whole experiment that RBC performed between NVIDIA, AMD, and competitors is useless since GPUs aren't being used in Bitcoin mining, it's all ASICS, thus they are incorrectly inferring that Bitcoin is the cause of the stock's price rise when in reality it's more likely those GPUs are being used for altcoin mining which use different proof of work algorithms in which GPUs are feasible for mining.

There's nothing stopping you, in fact, this has already been done hundreds of times in the past. Have you ever heard of Litecoin, Dogecoin, DASH? These were all clones of Bitcoin but with slightly different variations in their parameters. Of course those are only the ones that have been moderately successful and gaining some community, but consider there have been hundreds perhaps thousands of similar attempts that have gone nowhere. 
There was even a website that would automatically create a new coin for you at the push of a button, but of course there is more to jump starting a cryptocurrency than just putting out the code, that's the easy part; the hard part is creating a community around it.
Bitcoin already has a huge community and infrastructure built around it's usage so simply copying the same exact code and trying to get people to buy it and use it would likely be futile and a huge waste of your time.

Coinbase is just easier to use by not having to deal with all the different order types, otherwise it's much cheaper (less fees) to buy/sell through an exchange. Also, GDAX is owned by Coinbase which means you can instantly transfer bitcoin between the two which is nice.

If inflation and spending is what drives an economy then Venezuela should be booming, no? They have lots of inflation and probably close to100% spend rate since saving money there means losing your purchasing power in short time.

Not as much as the existing financial system in which many of the environmental costs are hidden. It's easy to target Bitcoin as environmentally unfriendly because it's easier to calculate the costs of energy consumption from the network. However, people who attack Bitcoin for these reasons often fail look further into economic effects of such a system, and it turns out that a lot of Bitcoin mining farms are subsidizing green energy plants where energy would otherwise get wasted.

What are your thoughts on the instamine by the devs and the fact they control a majority of the coins? 
Also, do you think that the concept of whoever has the most money in the system has the most say is fair? I mean, this model kind of seems like a wet dream to governments and big corporations since it'll allow them to control the narrative with deep enough pockets.
Also, what do you think about the fact that in it's very early stages there is already huge amounts of spam, shitposts, and even stolen content blatantly copy and pasted from other sites without any attribution? I have a feeling the Steemit model incentives all the bad behaviors of Reddit but on steroids.

First of all, I wouldn't be putting in all of my savings, there's a reason people re-iterate the phrase: "Don't invest more than you can afford to lose."
Second, if you think the price is only going to go down then what's the point of investing in the first place? If you're in it for the long-term then you must believe that the price will be a lot higher at some point in the future, in which case simply holding is the correct strategy.


The flaw in this thinking is that you don't actually know it's going to be worth less.

I get where you're coming from but I'm not sure the SEC is really that relevant nor are they able to actually protect consumers. 
During the dotcom bubble when there were tons of scams and pump and dumps similar to the ICO stuff we see today the SEC didn't really protect anyone from that even though those securities were in full compliance with the regulations. 
During the '07-'08 debacle the SEC never did anything to protect consumers from mortgage backed securities filled with toxic debt, all within regulation, but they did nothing...
I hate these ICOs too and I know you're loving government more and more these days, but this agency really doesn't actually protect people, they're just there to look important and collect a paycheck. If anything, if the SEC does start going after the ICOs it'll be too late and will be the catalyst for the pop to occur and all these noobs will still lose their shirts anyways. 
No one has learned their lessons from the past whether it be the dotcom bubble the housing crash or the south seas bubble - there will always be stupid idiots in the world and perhaps getting scammed is a valuable lesson, a right of passage as has occurred to many of us in the Bitcoin space.

Faucets are a waste of time. Not only will it take you forever to get a minuscule amount of bitcoin but it'll also end up creating a bunch of tiny input transactions into your wallet which will mean if you ever want to spend it, it's going to cost a much higher transaction fee which could end up being higher than the amount your spending.

It is generally recommended that you don't keep coins on an exchange due to either hacking risks or confiscation risks, after all one of the main points of Bitcoin is that you be your own bank without the need of a third party, thus it makes sense to control your own coins.
We have a saying around here - If you don't hold the keys, it's not your bitcoin!

It looks like someone is trying to login to your account and likely entering the wrong password or perhaps change the password, thus the reason for all the 'confirm email' requests... I don't know, but you picked a pretty terrible wallet to store your Bitcoin in. If you can get access to your wallet again, I'd move them out of there and into one where you control the keys and has better security then that shit site.
I'd recommend the following:
* [Airbitz]( (iphone or Android)
* [Breadwallet]( (iPhone)
* [Mycelium]( (Android)
* [Copay]( (all devices)
* [Electrum]( (Desktop)
Just make sure you follow the appropriate backup procedures for whatever wallet you choose.

Indeed, and this also leads to a more sustainable economy rather than one focused on consumption. Since you're incentivized not to spend your bitcoin, when you do need to buy something out of necessity then you'll be more apt to get a higher quality "built to last" product rather than the disposable everything we see to today.

There is value in having a secure censorship resistant network for transferring value.

Yes, Bitcoin is the most secure network by far AND it is the most battle-tested. It's also proven that it's blockchain remains immutable. It's also looking quite promising in terms of scaling which has been an ongoing issue that has likely been holding back the price, and looks like we'll be on track to a scaling solution over the summer.
Ethereum, while it's new and shiny with all sorts of fancy buzzwords has a lot of it's own problems that it faces, one of which that it scales far far worse than bitcoin and while they claim they have a solution it's still very far away and mostly theoretical at the moment. In addition, the recent ICO craze on the Ethereum network is full of pump and dump scams that will collapse eventually, likely bringing Ethereum down with it. Finally, and most importantly, Ethereum is not an immutable network, it's demonstrated in the past that they're willing to rollback the blockchain, which kind of defeats the whole point in my opinion.

Yes segwit itself is not a long term solution, however it does fix the maelibility bug which is important for devs to work on and implement second layer scaling solutions like lightening network, tumblebit, sidechains, etc...

This is not Bitcoin's fault, you used the worst possible methods for selling bitcoin possible despite the countless warnings about selling bitcoin for paypal all over the Internet.
Regardless, I'd even say that if all you have is $700 to your name then the last thing you should be investing in is a highly volatile and experimental currency such as Bitcoin. Get yourself educated and use your money to buy a personal finance book.

It sounds like you're just interested in Bitcoin for short term gambling in which case you probably shouldn't bother since you'll likely just end up panicking and get rekt doing something stupid.
If you're actually interested in Bitcoin's tech and future prospects then just buy and hold for the long term; and don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
And while you're at it, educate yourself on what you're investing in:

We really don't know, it depends on whether or not you believe bitcoin will be successful for the long term and whether or not you can avoid panicking during volatile price swings, both up and down. If Bitcoin is successful in the long term then the price will have to be much much higher than it is today and many people around here believe that, but it could also be worth nothing too. The general rule of thumb around here is don't invest more than you can afford to lose. Also, rather than trying to time the market, just take a [dollar cost averaging approach]( to help smooth out the volatility in your position and hodl.

I really have no idea, it's Bitcoin so anything's possible short-term but if I had to pull a wild guess out of my ass I'd say it won't go back below 550 or even 600 but who the hell really knows; you'll just give yourself anxiety trying to time the market. The better approach in my opinion is to simply dollar cost average and buy a smaller fixed amount each week. If Bitcoin is successful long-term, over the course of many years then the price will have to be significantly higher than it is now.

So your point is to activate Segwit and Schnorr signatures, the same scaling roadmap that is suggested by Core, sounds great but it's nothing new, this is the direction we've been trying to go for awhile now had it not been for r/btc, Ver, Jihan, and others trying to stall that plan.

If it doesn't confirm then it will eventually get dropped from the mempool and will show back in your wallet you tried to send from.

Segwit2x is being made compatible with Core (at the moment) and thus activation of Segwit prior to August likely wouldn't effect holders in anyway other than making them richer. And yes, it would also mean August 1 would be a non-event.

You haven't found an answer to that because we can't predict what the price is going to do.

There's four main paths right now and one of them will emerge: Segwit2x, Bip148, Legacy Chain (status quo), Bitmain hard fork. 
If the first two happen then we get Segwit and can proceed to scale. If the legacy chain remains then scaling is prolonged further. If Bitmain hard forks with it's privately mined chain and that gets adopted then Bitcoin is no longer decentralized and would be considered a failure in my opinion, but think this is an unlikely option - no one will follow a chain controlled by one company.
It's scary right now, but I do believe that either Segwit2x or Bip 148 will prevail eventually and that'll be good for bitcoin and the price.

Yes I mostly use it for a store of value aka hodling but you don't really need fast cheap transactions for that, which is why I'm wondering what the use case is for Ethereum that requires a smart contract platform to make large amounts of fast cheap transactions on regular basis.

There isn't an easy way at the moment since it is such a rushed project with little documentation and little time for wallets and exchanges to support it. The best thing to do is keep the coins in a wallet you control, sit tight, wait for after August 1st and someone will create a guide or service for how to split the coins.

As for whether it's worth acquiring, you have to decide that for yourself, do you want or need bitcoin? If you're thinking of buying it as an investment then I'd recommend doing some more research and figure out if you think Bitcoin will be successful in the long term - if it is then the price would have to be much higher than it is today and a lot of people around here think that.
A good rule of thumb that we say around here - don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

Bitcoin is money, thus the only "selling" I'll do will be exchanging it for goods and services at some point in the future.
If you think that the "pyramid" will fall, then why even put your money at risk, you're just gambling at this point. If you don't believe in Bitcoin's long term success, just sell now and get out, otherwise you'll probably just lose money making short-sighted panicky decisions.

@_date: 2018-12-14 17:31:40
Here's the way I think about it. My hardware wallet is my savings account and my LN wallet/node is like my everyday wallet that I carry cash in. With an LN wallet, like you're regular wallet, you wouldn't store all your money in it because it's possible you could lose it or have it stolen - you only put in a small amount at a time for spending while you keep the rest of your money in a more secure environment like a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-29 16:26:34
I can't tell you what to do with your own finances, but I'd say it depends on what you think of the long term viability and success of Bitcoin is. If you think it'll be successful in the long term then you haven't seen nothing yet, we're still in the early stages of adoption, and the price will have to be much much higher than it is now. On the other hand, if you're just into bitcoin to make a quick buck, then you'll probably have a bad time.
I personally buy a little bit of bitcoin at the end of each month with left over money from that month's budget regardless of the price ([dollar cost averaging]( it's play money for me and if I lost it all it wouldn't affect my life in any way. It's part of the number 1 rule around here - "Don't invest more than you can afford to lose."
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:18:32
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:04:41


Sounds like you're actually gambling instead of investing. If you don't know what you're investing in then you probably shouldn't be in it. If you're just here for short term profits then cash out and be happy with your returns. 
Otherwise, do some more research and figure out if you think Bitcoin will be successful in the long term, and if so then it'd only make sense to hold for the long term since the price would have to be much higher than it is today.
@_date: 2019-05-30 19:27:51
Even with the price rising, if you're consistently buying $300 worth of Bitcoin every week then you can probably get to 1 btc in less than a year. Taking out a loan to buy a speculative risky asset is not a good idea.

It's probably for the best. It's no secret that Bitcoin is very volatile and if you can't handle that then it's not for you. People who succeed in this space are ones that simply put in money they can afford to lose and just sit on it for a long time without panicking.
@_date: 2017-06-28 15:49:44
Yea a lot of the wallets' fee calculation algorithms are messed up and don't reflect the current low mempool size. I've been able to send transactions for less than 20 cents and have them get confirmed within a half hour, sometimes sooner.

Just had a frustrating buying experience with Bitcoin Black Friday for buying from Lollyphile.
Went to buy $24 worth of Sriracha Bacon lolly pops, click on pay with Bitcoin and says price is .02198 btc, so I go to my Coinbase account and send .02198 btc to the address they provide. Go back to Lollyphile payment screen and says price is now .022 btc and that .0002 btc is due... WTF! So I go back to coinbase and send another .0002 to same address. Finally order goes through.
Honestly, buying something with BTC was not as easy as everyone makes it out, and I'm pretty tech literate too, but this was just frustrating.
Also, it doesn't make sense for me to buy BTC with USD, then use BTC to buy a product, when I could have just skipped the middle man and bought with straight USD. Not to mention that on any other day, Coinbase would charge me a fee for buying BTC, which means I'd end up paying more for buying a product with BTC.
Now some merchants give a discount for paying in BTC which might make this worthwhile but in the case of Lollyphile, they provided "free shipping" to anyone who bought with BTC but upon further investigation, the free shipping option was actually available to anyone on black friday. Kind of a lame promotion and didn't really offer an incentive of buying with BTC over USD, since both payment methods had the same discount.
I'm a bit soured on BTC, I just don't get how this is convenient as a currency.
