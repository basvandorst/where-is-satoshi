AMAZING CONGRATS!
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:18:59
release already so you layer 2 people can get off the main chain already and we can refocus onchain
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:49:37
This one is way better:

my number 1 feature request right now
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:36:45


which alts?
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:28:07
this &amp; Schnorr = omggggg

So you'd have an account in the network that you can constant top up? That's slightly better. Or do you need to to pay for every open channel + btc deposit (miners fee)

But the Marines will pay most of my share?

Best software wallet by far!!! Bring back the old school send/receive icons and colours!
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:49:32
I don't have a credit card
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:49:21
Doesn't cost money to take money in and out of checking account, and it's not locked once it's in there
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:00:50
great. will trezor support come before 1.0?

BEST WALLET EVER.
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:03:43
by far the best hot wallet! Samourai hardware wallet is my wet dream. 
bitcoin needs more projects like this that actively build for bitcoins ACTUAL use instead of "investment wallets" (typing that make me puke in my mouth a bit)
thank fuck for Samourai team! constantly updating to the most current tech and building the most badass wallet out there. this is the reason that i got so deep into bitcoin, because with Samourai you can actually use btc as intended!
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:46:42
i just threw up a bit in my mouth
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:58:51
are you planning a major UX change? i love the current look/feel
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:49:23


how much more secure is Trezor than an offline phone using Copperhead OS + Samourai, only connecting online to transact?
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:02:57
Lets say a potential hacker is eyeing my account. I log in using my Trezor as U2F, do my trading, log out, disconnect my Trezor. Is there any weak link in that set of actions that would render my Trezor vulnerable to hack? I ask because as great as it is to use the Trezor as a U2F key, I don't see the point if it makes the private keys on open to attack in the slightest way. Better to get a dedicated U2F key, or does it not matter?
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:59:20
I want a card, like Xapo or BitPay, that I can load BTC and spend in fiat, but from a company that doesn't support 2X like the 2 above.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:02:32
Thanks. So the bitcoin addresses in my Trezor are in no way used or accessible during the U2F signing process. Am I right in thinking that any account using a U2F physical key is unhackable?
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:00:38


what does that mean?
