No. 
Banks creates new money when someone takes a loan. Not all of it, but often atleast 90% is new money. Thats not something you can disagree about, thats how it works.
How much interest rate they charge depends on the risc they judge that they do not get the loan back. 
Here you can find research.
Here are some opinions.

This new Money as Debt video very clearly explains in plain English
(1) how fractional reserve banking began, 
(2) it identifies many of the problems caused by our existing debt-based money system, and, importantly, 
(3) it defines what we can do to break this cycle of debt and, through monetary reform such as the American Monetary Act, how we can have an honest, debt-free monetary system which will provide huge benefits to the American people.
This colorful and very entertaining video is the best I have ever seen to explain the problems and the solutions necessary for true monetary reform.
