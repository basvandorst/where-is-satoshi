I do not undestand this logic. You know we need transaction fees to support the miners? Using Coinbase helps with this goal.

This is cool. I hope that exchanges would start providing such a service also. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:54:07
This is huge.. for XMR.

Thank you for your reply. Good to hear that you think it will happen (and is possible). 
Yes, I was not implying you should do it. That was more high level thought.. because I feel for LN to became relevant to everyone on the planet these things are eventually needed.

Good work. This is going in the right direction. For a mainstream product I feel that having to connect to a node is already too much. Is there any reason why this could not be automated and put to the background, so that the user does not even need to know there is a node he is connected to? Also if a reputable service had their own LN wallet software.. could it be designed so that the wallet already has a channel opened? I mean people already trust exchanges with huge amounts of money. Having the service provider potentially "have control" over your channel should not be a big deal if the amounts of money is not large. The point is that someone poor could start receiving money right away without having to open a channel first? Have I misunderstood something?

I for one think LN will actually INCREASE on-chain transaction count demand.. Hoping to be wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:57:51
I thought that people would not pay this much. I thought that the fee market would not work. I have been proven wrong :(
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:48:36
Pretty much exactly my thought. 
Also the fact that there is talk about only keeping small amounts active in the channel, so refilling the channel is also a burden. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 05:31:27
Well if you actually followed the situation in Venezuela you would know there is very little onchain transactions happening in BTC. Mycelium is pretty much an onchain wallet only for BTC?

It's a terrible payment method, I've had a transaction stuck for 2 months.

Empty blocks everynow and then are good, they raise the fees and help maintain a healthy mining ecosystem for the future.

Legal action? Lol?

what is npc
@_date: 2019-04-05 06:47:26
Well everything is relative. For a Venezuelan even those are high, but luckily they use centralized services where they pay a % and not a dollar amount fee.

I thought that the hong kong agreement was the compromise. Now people are pushing segwit without the -blockmaxsize=1000000 adjustment.
@_date: 2018-03-13 07:49:23
This is bad for Bitcoin. Fees need to be higher to sustain the network as the block reward keeps getting smaller. People should not try to pay as little as possible.
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:13:02
Bitcoin needs high fees according to Greg
@_date: 2017-09-28 04:56:16
Thank you for your reply.
I personally think we are past a point where rational arguments matter anymore. This is war between 2x and no2x. If 2x happens I hope that both chains survive, and Core finds ways to keep the minority chain alive if 2x indeed hard forks with 90%+ hashpower.  Largest pity would be that Core developers also leave the no2x chain to other coins.
@_date: 2018-03-31 11:35:11
Well it depends, there are many economists here. But the number of users is so large that they are a small minority percentage wise. Also economist do not tend to agree even themselves and many topics are quite subjective. 
But yes there is a lot of stuff here that does not make any sense but trying to correct it would be an impossible task.
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:11:47
This is good in preventing spam from filling up the blockchain. If there was a minimum fee required raising the blocksize would not be as dangerous as without a minimum fee requirement. All miners should do this.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:46:00
As much as I agree with most of the things you say, there are parts that can be considered totally opposite. "2x is a tiny number.." but had people come to an agreement there would be no ecosystem rift. Confidence loss.. why not confidence building, as in -- ecosystem is ready to act when faced with new situations -- like median fee rising from the default satoshi/per bite it had been for years.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:02:54
I think you miss the whole point of segwit2x trying to kill the legacy chain with the hardfork. If they succeed there will be no "Bitcoin", so are the exchanges going to remove Bitcoin and just list S2X? S1X needs to stay alive for there even be a discussion about what is Bitcoin. I think that if S1X stays alive S2X should not even be listed.. it would just create confusion. It needs to be either or.

Competetion is good. I would support this fork. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 06:02:58
Lol what, tx/s is the only relevant measure
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:48:43
Good write-up. I disagree and think that Core should just change POW and get rid of the miners for good. 
The comment section gave me cancer. If 2x was really Jihad Wu taking over Bitcoin, you do realize that Core could just hardfork 2mb blocks and Jihad's evil conspiracy would fail, yes/no?
@_date: 2018-07-22 05:03:05
He is correct.

If all or most the miners collude -- bigger blocks do not solve this problem. If it just a lone miner, a larger block makes it more difficult, perhaps even unprofitable. 
Think of one miner having 100% of the hashpower and the block being 10% full of "real use." In such a scenario it is indeed possible for the miner to spam the blocks full for free, no matter the blocksize,  (because he gets all the transaction fees back as the only miner on the network), making the legitimate 10% of users pay larger fees than originally was needed.
Now think of one miner having 20% of the hashpower and the blocks being 10% full of legitimate use. Now when the miner starts spamming the network he will only get 20% of the transaction fees back that he uses to spam the network. So not only he has to spam a lot (90% of blocksize), he has to pay a lot for it. Not profitable.
Now consider a miner who has 20% of the network hashrate, and the blocks being 90% full of real use. Now the miner will have to spam less to start making the fees rise.
The same logic continues, the larger the miners share of the total hashrate is, the more of the spam he pays he will get back to himself making it cheaper to spam. Also the fuller the blogs are, less spam is needed to raise the fees. If the miner controls 40% of the network, the blocks are full and the miner has a good understanding of wallet fee estimates, it becomes almost trivial to spam profitably. This is because most of the spam is actually never even mined if done in bursts.
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:33:22
I have played around with this idea quite a lot and ran a few test scenarios. My conclusion was that this indeed is possible and also profitable for a large enough miner. I also wrote a longish post on the subject but after pondering on it for quite some time decided not to publish it. 
Why not publish it? Firstly because I try not to participate in the blocksize debate (in my opinion, this "profitable spamming" is made possible because the blocks are full/almost full) and secondly I actually came to the conclusion that "It does not matter." For short term this is bad of course, but in the long term if Bitcoin is as antifragile as is believed, it will self correct somehow.
