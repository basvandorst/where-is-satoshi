I doubt you own anything substantial 
@_date: 2018-08-13 08:14:46
You just need to find a place that accepts.

I don't know what that means. The lower end Nokia smartphones are Android one

What is your definition of sound money?
@_date: 2018-08-13 05:35:57
Name one viable real world block chain application that has been implemented. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 12:11:10
Is it android one as well?

Well wouldn't life have been looking really good when btc was at 20k? 
@_date: 2018-08-13 10:09:06
Haha as if not reading some bullshit Austrian Economics book on cryptocurrency is the definition of being ignorant. You're the one who can't even define a term you've used.
@_date: 2018-08-13 08:14:27
Haha no. I'm not going to read a whole book to respond to you, because you cannot define a term.
@_date: 2018-08-13 03:34:46
So you want a "sound money" that no one uses? 
@_date: 2018-08-13 08:54:30
Whoa, I hope you're kidding. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 07:58:11
USD will work almost anywhere.

BTC is up 600% over the past year, can you explain how this is blood in the streets?
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:04:52
Yes, it's amazing how shortsighted people are. When the market is irrationally high, they think they are Warren Buffet, and when a traded goes against them, they cry market manipulation and talk about the need for regulation.
@_date: 2018-04-02 05:38:16
Yes, I was posting that in agreement with you. 600% up for the year in not blood on the streets by any measure.
@_date: 2018-04-02 04:51:44
Up 600% over the past year.
@_date: 2018-04-02 04:50:47
Up 600% over the past year, and OP is talking about blood in the streets, so ridiculous.
