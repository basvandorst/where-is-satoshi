Cash App imo. Fast and easy.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:23:17
Yes, but it was instant when I had to verify.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:09:57
I have no idea, I was just joking lol

Just hope it keeps out of the government's hands.

If it's a steady rise up, I'm holding. If not, I'm pulling.

This just in, Lamborghini stock is up.

Oh yeah there's no reason why it won't hit 20k again, so I say buy in as much as you can.

21 million bitcoins is the max limit.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:35:46
No problem dude! To me it seems to be the best by far!
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:54:01
That's always my luck lol

Cash App is a good platform for beginners. No fees to buy/sell and super easy.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:11:33
I just bought in $500. It should go up to $20k soon

There's a small local bank where I live that banned all Bitcoin transactions from processing on accounts because someone that banked with them was caught dealing drugs big time on the dark net and caused them to get a shit load of subpoenas.

I use Cash App and it's very good. No fees compared to coinbase and it's easy and fast

Because institutions are buying into it.

Just got back from my time machine, he's right.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:57:44
I think that a lot of people will get scared at 20k in fear of what happened last time and cause it to drop off again.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:16:28
Same. I bought in $5k in 2013 when it was like $300 per coin but pulled out at $600 cause I needed the money at the time. It sucks lol
