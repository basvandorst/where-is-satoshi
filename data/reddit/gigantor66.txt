Why would you not want an on-ramp to Bitcoin that is immediately accessible by BILLIONS of people?

FYI - This quote is about a current Facebook subsidiary **unrelated to Libra**. Facebook Payments, Inc. is Facebook's current equivalent to Paypal. I get that you all want to hate Libra, and there are reasons to look at it with skepticism. But come on. At least be honest about it.
The complete context of the quote (emphasis added):
"**In response to questions about what sort of consumer financial information Facebook** ***already*** **has**, Marcus wrote that **a subsidiary** of the social media giant (**unrelated to Libra**) stores “non-public personal financial information data,” such as payment credentials, in compliance with existing law for transactions, but that this information is not used for advertising or for personalization.
Moreover, because the **Facebook Payments, Inc. subsidiary** processes these transactions, Facebook itself does not have access to any payment credentials information, though it does collect other information affiliated with a transaction, such as the merchant, the transaction amount, the date and time and the purchased good."

The hardest part about obtaining bitcoin now is getting fiat onto an exchange. Libra can be purchased by anyone with a bank account and a Facebook-product account, and the Libra association is planning to dump $$$ into building out infrastructure to allow unbanked people to exchange physical fiat for libra (like ATMs).
We know that libras will not be confined to the Calibra wallet, so there is nothing to stop users from buying libra, sending it to an exchange, and trading it for bitcoin. 
This is HUGE for bitcoin, and anyone who doesn't see that is blinded by their hatred for Facebook. Facebook and co. are going to be spending their own $ to make it easier for people to access bitcoin.

Assuming there even is bitcoin, that is not how the estate tax works in the United States. Your estate tax liability is calculated based on the value of the inheritance at the time of death, not the value at the time they are received. So it would be more like $50-60 million.

This is false

If you trade your Bitcoin for anything, cash, crypto, or goods/services, the IRS considers this to be a taxable event. You will owe capital gains tax on the difference between the value you received and your basis (what you originally paid for the BTC)
This is a major flaw in the current law. If I buy a cup of coffee with Bitcoin that has appreciated in value above my basis, I technically owe the IRS

Hypo: I own a business that produces widgets. Widgets cost $1 to produce, and I sell them in a competitive market for $5 each. My competitors produce identical widgets at varying costs, but sell at $5. I have invested $100 into equipment to produce my widgets.
After several successful years of business, consumers discover that widgets serve no purpose and are useless; not even as scrap or paperweights. They would not even pay a single cent for a widget it is that useless.
What is the value of a widget?
Under your theory, it is some measure of value based on the equipment used to produce widgets. But guess what? It's zero. Nobody wants widgets anymore. It doesn't matter how much I and my competitors buy out or trade each other's stock of widgets to prop up the price. Eventually, I go bankrupt.

I don't think I am going out on a limb saying this..
 You do not seem to understand basic economics.
I discourage anyone considering this from signing up for a subscription to his "system."
