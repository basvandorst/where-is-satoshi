Sure! There are two kinds of segwit addresses currently. The P2SH-P2WPKH addresses all start with a 3, and then look like a "normal" bitcoin address after (Non-segwit addresses all start with a 1, if you haven't noticed). These addresses are 100% compatible with non-segwit addresses, transfers both ways work just fine. The native format for segwit is bech32, and those addresses all start with "bc1" and then a mostly normal bitcoin-type string of characters, with the exception that all letters are lower-case. Sending to/from bech32 addresses may not be supported by all wallets. 
The 3* addresses are kinda like transition segwit addresses, when there's more support everyone should transition to bc1* addresses for some slight additional benefits I don't quite remember off the top of my head.

Because there's no guarantee that the party I'm working with to top off my LN balance will actually do so after I send the on-chain transaction. I would love for there to be a mathematically secure way to do so (like hopping through payment channels with LN payments). 
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:49:21
As long as what is described isn't a complete graph, then yes. If the Engineer (or someone in his network) makes a payment to the power company (or someone in their network), so that payment flows in the other direction along the channel as usual, then the channel can be rebalanced. Any of the three could make a payment to themselves specifying the other direction through the channels as well. Hopefully that kind of thing will be automated by software.

Mycelium doesn't even do P2SH-P2WPKH segwit (3* addresses), let alone bech32 (bc1* addresses).

I have the price on my watch face. Mostly so I can buy a little extra with my DCA. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:19:57
Yeah, exactly. People who talk about closing channels all the time are missing the point. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:38:01
Samourai is good, it supports Segwit so your transfers will be cheaper. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:43:06
It's going in the GUI on the next release. Also, it doesn't matter if they didn't as the other commenter said. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:08:14
You're fine now. Your wallet has been empty for the last six blocks.
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:23:15
If the other person in the channel funds it, yes. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:24:54
1. When it's in one it won't be valid in another.
2. It's possible, and likely.
3. Sure, but if any of them break ranks they can profit, so it's unlikely.
4. Just one. Orphaned blocks can happen but get discarded.
5. Yes, you have to start over mining a new block. Block propogation is much faster than mining time. 
6. 
7. 
8. 
9. "But it's not like there's a place where people can bid USD for BTC" - There are many such places, that's what an exchange is.
10. I'd say it's the same as 9.
11. It makes the blockchain secure. I'm fond of Gridcoin for using useful calculation as part of mining for this reason, though. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:36:19
It follows the same rule as other property. If you sell less than a year after you buy, it's short-term. If you sell more than a year after you buy, it's long-term. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:39:29
Sending BTC to a hardware wallet is where you had the confirmations, right? That's the best way, and not really avoidable. Six confirmations is plenty to trust the old wallet being empty of BTC so you can claim all the forks.
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:38:34
This one: 
Samourai is great.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:49:11
You can send from their webpage. They have the keys. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:28:56
Then the hardware wallet doesn't matter, just the seed. Hardware wallets are an efficient way to create the seed, you don't need to worry about booting a computer to a live CD os while it's offline to generate one, etc.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:29:37
The PIN only protects access to the ledger. The seed words alone are enough to get the private keys. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:12:31
While that's true, it would also mean that the price of my groceries, mortgage, gas for my car, etc are all wildly fluctuating as well. That takes the wind out of the sails on that idea for me. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:58:19
Perfect, as long as there's a way to link the on-chain and off-chain transactions in the rebalance in a trustless way, I'm great. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:47:02
I think he's saying he can evade taxes with that plan, not that it isn't taxable. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:02:06
Move the BTC to a new address. New paper wallet, hardware wallet, etc. When that move is confirmed, then use the private key of your paper wallet to claim airdrops. If you don't do this and claim all forks, you will almost certainly have your BTC stolen. I'd claim everything you can as quickly as you can, in case one of the claiming methods are unethical and try to take other forks. Coinomi is self-explanatory when you have it installed. Other airdrops may have unique claiming methods you'd need to Google to find, like pasting your private key into a webpage. I would grab the forks on Coinomi first.

@_date: 2018-01-06 17:00:56
That's theoretically possible, but it would take an absolutely amazing amount of computing power, and it's just not going to happen. With one block it might end up being orphaned, but six is far enough back that you're fine. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:33:54

Shorter block times increases the chance of orphaned blocks. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:56:33
It's like saying your money isn't really yours because it's cash instead of in your bank account. You can still make payments with LN, it's secure because the blockchain is there as an arbiter if needed. LN money is real money. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:48:50
Yeah, one BTC being able to buy a pair of socks vs. a car is a hell of a difference.

I just found out about Gridcoin, it uses distributed computer on BOINC as part of the basis for being rewarded coins. Still a bit of a shitcoin, but I like that it motivates people to put computer power toward scientific research.

Yeah, since the BTC wallet is empty you're fine to grab the forks. No idea on parallel transfer.

She can close the channel any time she'd like. If she tries to close it with an out-of-date channel state, you can take the full balance with the more recent state.

You can leave the BTC on the paper wallet, but you definitely should not. I've used Coinami to sweep some airdrops.

Sweeping to a hardware wallet would keep your old keys which had online exposure, and defeats the whole purpose of a hardware wallet in the first place. 
@_date: 2019-07-20 15:12:09
The benefits of CPFP if you add a wallet you control into the mix is a good point, for payments that are urgent. 


Coinbase Pro pays the transaction fees for you, and from my experience with them they've always vastly overpaid so that the transaction gets picked up quickly. That could certainly change, or something could happen where the mempool spikes suddenly and it's no longer a relatively high fee. 
In any case, if he's transferring to his own wallet, and then transferring to the service he's paying for, he'll still be dealing with whatever happens with the Coinbase transfer. It would make sense to buy from Coinbase at some point well before, transfer to his own wallet at a time that is convenient, and then have that balance ready to pay for the service at the time required, but he seems to want to start from having 0 BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-17 22:50:28
Private keys in emails resulting in coins being stolen isn't going to make me worry about bitcoin being a secure store of value. That's like saying people can steal your gold if you leave it in a pile on your coffee table.

That's true for transactions that are all within LN. I mean the situation where my payment channel is exhausted, and I want to rebalance by sending an on-chain transaction to a party with the expectation that they send an off-chain (LN) transaction to me. What security is there to be sure the LN transaction is guaranteed if I send the on-chain transaction?
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:16:52

It's also not impossible to win the lottery seven times in a row. That is much, much, *much* more likely than lucking into a randomly generated 24-word seed with an active wallet. At some point things become so unlikely that it's easier to just say not possible. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:07:50

Is there a trustless method for adding and removing LN funds with the single on-chain transactions? That part would make me a bit nervous. 
@_date: 2019-07-19 16:46:54




If I counted right, you had 2.5 x 10^(79) listed as the total possible seed phrase combinations. The number of atoms in the *observable universe* is estimated to be between 10^(78) and 10^(82). It would be well more than atoms in the solar system. :-)
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:16:36

Yeah, sorry. I wasn't clear. I've seen people claim that a channel with total funding of .5 BTC can do payments of 1 BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:57:20

As in blockchain.info?
@_date: 2019-07-20 03:40:39
No worries, everyone starts somewhere. Feel free to ask if anything doesn't make sense. 
Spending coins and moving coins to a wallet are fundamentally the same thing. When you spend them, you're just moving them into an address controlled by the person you're buying something from. Any wallet you use will have addresses that you would move the coins to from Coinbase.
When you withdraw coins from Coinbase they'll ask you what address to send them to (it will start with a 1, a 3, or a bc1). When doing that to a wallet you control, you'll use the wallet to find what the receiving address is. When you make a payment, you would get that address from whoever you're paying (also starting with a 1, a 3, or a bc1), and put that into your wallet to get the transaction into the blockchain. If you buy coins and immediately spend them, just get that address from the people you're paying, and put it into Coinbase when they ask where to withdraw funds. 
Coinbase Pro might be better for this, they don't charge you for the transaction fees, and they generally make them high enough that the payment goes through very quickly. If you don't mind waiting for a fiat transfer, their fees for buying bitcoin are super cheap as well. You should be able to move funds from "normal" Coinbase to Coinbase Pro for free as well.

There are no hurdles. The words are all they need, unless you added a passcode when setting up your wallet.

@_date: 2019-07-20 15:16:16
The only concern I'd have is if your work would have an issue with you installing a non-work application on their computer. Or if they have monitoring software for whatever reason, they'd know how much Bitcoin you're moving. For the data itself, just make sure that the address on the ledger matches what the software says for the receive address, and that when you copy/paste it hasn't changed to something else.

I feel like answering "Yes" to the twenty times a day this gets asked. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:14:05
He's not spending his coins, and maybe/probably lost them.
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:43:34
I'm in the US, and I say the new week starts Monday. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:25:36
With those payments being unidirectional, they would get imbalanced and have to close at some point without something else happening (like a channel factory). 
@_date: 2019-07-27 22:33:36
The price is completely irrelevant.
@_date: 2019-07-15 16:13:01


No, that is literally all they would need. You could take those 12 words and recreate the wallet using any bitcoin wallet software. The 12 words are a direct line to the data needed to access the wallet. They're not "getting in" to your online wallet account, they're bypassing that entirely to get to the bitcoin wallet itself. Online wallets that have passwords/2FA/etc are using normal access methods because entering the 12 words instead every time would be fantastically insecure. If the online wallet went down, data was irretrievably lost, etc, the 12 words would let you access the coins still. You can add a "13th word" (or 25th, for more secure wallets) that isn't one of the BIP39 words that would also be needed to access your wallet (and that is \*not\* the same as the password you use to sign into the online wallet).
If you have zero coins in that wallet now, you can verify by putting them into a site that converts them to the private keys and look at the transaction history.
See here for more info:  [
Hardware wallets are good: Trezor, Ledger, Coldcard, etc. Some people don't like Ledger because they're not open source. Those take your seed phrase, which ideally has never been entered into something connected to the internet, and allow you to sign transactions without having the seed phrase exposed to the internet.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:01:30
If your second payment has a high enough fee it may help get the first one moving. 
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:32:00
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:12:28
It's not a chain, and it doesn't have an operator. It uses the Bitcoin blockchain for a secure source of truth. It's kinda like a Bitcoin checking account. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:26:21
It does.
@_date: 2019-07-26 22:14:12


If they know them and can give them to you, that's the definition of custodial. With non-custodial wallets, only you know the keys.
@_date: 2019-07-26 20:31:51
Same site, it looks like. They're a custodial wallet, so exactly what people mean when they say "not your keys, not your coins." Also, as far as just custodial wallets go, I feel like people would rank them toward the bottom.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:57:16
Not that I know of. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:51:01
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:46:14
People felt like selling more than buying. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:39:10
Search for "casascius coins" and you can find some. I've heard they're expensive. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:47:53
It's almost certainly just a change address. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:50:38
There's no final block.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:58:45
Why would that happen?
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:11:25
I'd say useful. Trust doesn't really factor into it. Also, your t-shirt dude would be better covered with more than one channel open himself anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:47:42
They're available on LN, and can be trusted to be available on-chain when the channel closes (unless they spend them first).
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:54:47
Potentially, but it doesn't have to. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:48:39
It's been crashing up, then.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:04:54
You can do it with Android Wear, yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:46:39
A view of the current lightning network on testnet. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:18:33
Yeah, and that's still trustless. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:13:42
Do you think someone owns the trademark for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:41:41
Do they not allow sending to a 3* address or a bc1* address? 3* SegWit addresses are 100% compatible with 1* addresses, so that's just weird. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:56:29
The backup is the seed for an algorithm that deterministically creates the same series of addresses. The transactions are in the blockchain.  Your backup is not a snapshot in time.
@_date: 2019-07-29 23:55:59
One million could have 21. Ten million could have 2.1. One hundred million could have .21.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:32:11
It's still secure. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:03:48
Coinbase is fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:19:41
Samourai, it does segwit and a lot of other good stuff. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:53:18
I just checked my full node, and it's using 161 GB of storage. You'll be fine with a TB.
@_date: 2019-07-12 23:49:51
Basically just convenience. If one is lost/stolen/damaged you don't have to wait to buy a new one to move your coins.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:54:11
A payment channel opened with a balance of .1 cannot send more than that amount in one direction, because that is how much is in the on-chain transaction involved in its creation. It's like an hourglass filled with, say, .1oz of sand. You can't end up with 1oz of sand at one end because it just doesn't have that much in it, but you can move the .1oz back and forth as much as you'd like. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:21:51
That is most definitely not how it works. Watch this video, they explain it well: 
In that example, Bob opens a payment channel of .05 BTC with a coffee shop. He can make as many payments as he'd like as long as there is still balance on his side of the payment channel, but he cannot send the coffee shop 1 BTC. 
If there was no limit to how much can be sent over a payment channel, then why would a payment channel even have a size associated with it?
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:23:00
A bit is 1.4¢ right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:28:26
People have named units already, I'm not just making shit up: 
Millibitcoins, or mBTC, are .001 BTC. At current prices, that's ~$14. That seems to be the unit you're referring to. Microbitcoin, μBTC, commonly called a bit, is .000001 BTC. One thousandth of a mBTC, or 1.4¢. One bit is 100 satoshis.
Samourai and Mycelium both use the unit "bit" for .000001 BTC in their unit preferences.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:56:34
Legacy 1* addresses and segwit 3* addresses are 100% compatible. That's not an issue. Look at the transaction ID from GDAX on blockchain.info, see what it says there. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:51:10
Don't put the seed into a non-hardware wallet, that defeats the point of having one. If you *need* to send them do it, I guess, but you should set up a new hardware wallet as soon as possible if having a functional hardware wallet is important to you. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:40:09
I got a transaction to move by doing just that. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:22:30
It finally loaded for me again. I may move my stuff to another wallet after this, though. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:11:42
You don't need a channel with each shop you want to pay. You need a channel with someone who has that shop in their network of channels. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:37:38
Oh hey, that's a chart I've never seen before. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:46:16
Make a new account, send funds to the new account.
Test the new account before moving money... Set it up, wipe it, set it up again with your backup seed and be sure it's the same. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:23:43
Pretty much, yeah. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:52:14
You can put in a wrong PIN three times and then set it up from scratch.

It's about a penny with GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:32:10
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:21:25
They can include whatever they want. That's usually the transactions with the highest fees, because money is nice. That's a choice, though. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:25:21
They'd have to offer more than free coffee to make it worthwhile. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:47:26
There are Casascius coins, which are basically just fancy paper wallets. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:19:18
The comment was that the exchange owns the coins, not you. That's a separate idea than if it's good enough to keep coins on an exchange. I agree with you that it's good enough for most people, but that still means that they won't own their coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:06:28
It's still an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:21:42
Yes. It's exactly the same as exchanging it for cash, and then buying the thing with cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:29:17
Just leave them in GDAX (small amounts) or transfer them to your own wallet (anything significant).
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:18:25
Confirmations are from mining, not running nodes. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:13:47
You could be used as a part of a transaction for someone else you're connected with that would send funds the other way along that channel. Payments don't always need to be in one direction. They should not be. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:26:10
Literally last night. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:15:59

No more than a checking account not showing the "real balance" taking into account an uncashed check.

@_date: 2017-12-12 04:20:57
It's down $400 from this afternoon. Flat from this morning, haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:42:47
Search for "Mempool unconfirmed transactions" and I'm sure you'll find something. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:07:39
I did exactly what you're proposing. A transfer out isn't necessary, but it made me feel way better. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:07:12
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:27:47
It's possible. If it doesn't get picked up, it is returned to the sending address. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:45:05
I've always lost money trying to guess what will happen unless I just hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:27:55
Cool story, bro. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:13:09
It's there, but bech32. A 3* address would have been nice. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:04:52
Because they don't know better. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:00:00
Minutes? I have a complication on my watch face that tells me the current price. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:25:00
Cash out and buy again? That's exactly the same as leaving it alone, except you've created a short-term capital gains taxable event for yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:44:55
I feel like the behavior around how people send transactions will change before the mempool hits 1GB. Mine has already. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:21:14
Encourage him to open channels with nodes that aren't shitty and deny people. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:38:38
Did you open a node within eclair itself? The auto channel option links to Starblocks.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:26:54
You can buy instantly with money already there. I've got a few hundred on hand, and I buy $5 daily to dollar cost average. But no, if you want to buy a large amount now and don't have the money deposited already, then GDAX won't work for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:57:02
It'll restore with your seed, but if you want to be super paranoid restoring to a new Ledger will functionally be the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:37:40
Limit orders are free. I just do market orders because my time is more valuable... I do a $4 daily buy instead of my old Coinbase $25/week. The fee this morning was $0.007. Not a typo, 7/10¢. I'm fine paying that. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:16:05
Still above $10k 18 hours later. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:15:36
I'm planning on running a LN node, and I'm certainly not a big bank. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:40:53
With 3* segwit addresses, yes. bc1 addresses can be pickier, but they're not supported as much right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:38:18
It's probably more accurate to say that Ledger's specific calculation of the fees is higher for SegWit, not that all SegWit transactions are higher. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:22:15
I'd love one!
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:38:23
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:20:29
One confirmation means it has shown up in at least one block, but a competing blockchain with a greater length could potentially be chosen instead if two miners solved blocks at about the same time. At multiple confirmations (additional blocks being added after) that's pretty much impossible. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:32:05
There's an on-chain transaction that will have miner fees associated with it to open a payment channel. LN nodes can opt to charge a fee if your payment routes through them, but they won't be used often if that is too high. It'll be a race to the bottom for LN fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:42:03
If selling would put you in a higher tax bracket, putting it off to next year to keep the money in a lower bracket makes sense. I'm considering it. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:43:16
Keep trying, that's one of the bugs I've seen. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:03:42
Which part didn't you expect? The payment channel? I'd think that having coins to spend would be obvious. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:02:39
That would just be an on-chain transaction if it's not happening in a channel. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:56:18
Oh hey, I've never seen this chart before. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:26:07
You're rather optimistic.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:33:42
Buy on GDAX, too. The fees are about 1% as much. Literally ~$0.0125 instead of $1 for my daily $5 buys. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:46:47
I know. It would be enough to make a difference for me, especially when the wait is only a few weeks. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:24:50
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:23:01
No, just make yourself a calendar reminder every time you should put a buy in. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:02:18
Do you have more info on the layer between the blockchain and LN? Like a link to the paper?
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:49:21
Wonderful, thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:56:42
Yeah, I'm just talking about the person who wrote that. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:44:53
I buy $5 every morning when I wake up. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:41:17
Nah, I think I'll avoid getting scammed. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:16:58
That's up to you, dude. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:18:49
Bitcoins are just numbers on a ledger, they aren't things. It doesn't make sense to talk about them being made up of different coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:56:09
You can also connect through people who have connections to the vendor you're interested in paying. It doesn't need to be a hub, and you don't have to trust the intermediate LN nodes. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:48:30
They stay there while you hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:24:01
GDAX is free. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:36:55
Segwit addresses starting with bc1* can be picky. 3* addresses are 100% compatible with 1* addresses. There's not really much else you need to know. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:35:04
Nobody knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:46:16
There are more than enough addresses. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:40:17
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:06:22
That's not "the official Bitcoin app," FYI. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:34:54
There are two points here: what you're legally supposed to declare for taxes, and what can be enforced/audited. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:07:54
It's not a fork, it sits on top of segwit and uses on-chain transactions as they currently exist. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:41:50
You should use segwit anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:49:00
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:20:18
People can decide to run large, well-connected hubs that charge large fees and get the attention of the government, and people can choose not to use those hubs. You don't need that many connections to make it to basically anyone. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:05:30
The .1 channel will get imbalanced with the first payment, and transactions flowing the other way will need to happen before you can send the second .1 payment.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:08:42
Segwit fixed some transaction malleability issues that are required for LN to work. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:38:08
Using GDAX instead. You have to do it yourself, though. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:38:11
The only way to really do that off-network would be giving them the private key to an address. So you'd just be giving them the info they need to tell the network they are allowed to decrease the number at that address and increase numbers somewhere else. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:46:20
I just opened another auto channel and it's funded and ready to use. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:22:15
Sending from bc1* addressess to 1* addresses has issues, I believe. 3* and 1* addresses work find with each other. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:44:36
I don't think anybody knows this. I feel a lot will only be known as emergent behavior once it's in place. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:27:46
GDAX pays the miner fee. It's absolutely cheaper to send from GDAX than it is from coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:14:42
Yes, free as a user to transfer out. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:49:02
I'm still buying. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:54:33
I absolutely agree. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:48:04
Try it a few times, let us know how that works out for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:06:11
Yes, but doing that would defeat the purpose of having a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:10:16
I'm buying a small amount every day. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:30:52
Open with someone else, then.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:44:53
You wouldn't want to do that, even if you could. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:07:31
Move to GDAX, then transfer to Binance.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:33:05
I have plenty against Mike Adams.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:05:53
No, it's not what you said. He can make as many transactions as he'd like that sum up to .05, but he can't send more than that. 
Please explain to me how the one on-chain transaction of .05 that funds the payment channel can turn into a transaction of 1 when the channel is closed. Or, please link to an explanation like the video I linked. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:40:44
Nah, it's easy. HODL and DCA.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:25:26
What about it makes you say it's not trustless?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:49:10
Don't do that, even if you could. You may as well not even use a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:05:14
Same. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 21:24:20
Or, you know, measure it with purchasing power. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:34:12
Fair enough. I don't sell, but I do transfer to my Ledger. 
@_date: 2019-11-03 15:05:21
It didn't happen, because it was made-up bullshit.

Oh man, someone used Bitcoin? Such a failure!

Someone would have to replicate all the bitcoin network's hashpower, faster than the rest of the network, mining new blocks back 600 minutes ago where that transaction is not included, and then mine 60 following blocks (+new blocks while all this is going on) to get a new longest chain for the network to accept, rather than just spending that hashpower on mining. It ain't happening.

You can't really cancel transactions once they're in the mempool. You can do stuff like RBF and CPFP, but if a transaction is created and broadcasted, the exchange can't do anything about it. I should have said "added to a block" rather than "picked up by the network."

Orphaned blocks happen where there are two competing versions of the blockchain (due to very close timing in miners getting a successful block), only differing in the last block added. One of them wins out eventually, and the other becomes orphaned. Any blockchain explorer that uses the version of the chain that ultimately loses will show the transaction with 1 confirmation until the other chain wins. Orphaned blocks were once part of the blockchain, they just lost out. That's much, much less likely to happen to a block that isn't the latest (something with 2 confirmations), and it's basically impossible after that.
@_date: 2019-08-06 18:00:15
Technically only one miner ever gets your transaction. They make a valid block that includes it, and everyone accepts that it's correct and starts working on the next. The block propagation of that one miner's block happens pretty quickly, but the mining itself only touches your transaction the one time.
@_date: 2019-08-27 14:16:38
It's infinitely divisible (with a hard fork, but everyone would agree at that point). If there was only .5 BTC left you could chop it into small enough pieces for everyone to have small enough pieces to transact still.

Nah, you're fine to have both. Make the new bech32 account, and then pull up the old account to move things over.

I don't think a non-contentious hardfork would be considered a new coin, as 100% of people would want to move to something that was resistant to attack. A contentious hard fork could leave users on both, and each would probably call the other a new fork.

I bought and sold for essentially the same price after trying to be clever. My old cost basis was from years ago, so selling had a gain. Buying gave me a new cost basis. There were paper gains, although my overall position didn't change. I'll have a smaller paper gain in the future because of this.

I think some wallets may allow for a free transaction, but most miners will ignore it. With the mempool zeroing out regularly, it might be worth giving it a shot.

That part isn't even necessary if it's a custodial wallet where they still can use the seed phrase to control the wallet elsewhere.
@_date: 2019-09-11 16:36:50
Nope, just timing. The transaction security is the same. At 480 sat/byte they got in the next block. A 1 sat/byte fee might have taken a few hours, or in exceptional circumstances where transactions suddenly blew up might have been dropped from the mempool after a couple weeks. They also could have used RBF in that event, though. There are times that 1 sat/byte transaction still make it into the next block.
@_date: 2019-09-16 16:02:15
Segwit is an improvement to how transactions are made that allows you to save money on fees (and allows for things like the Lightning Network). Hash rate is the amount of mining being done.
@_date: 2019-09-03 22:21:38
It's kiiiiiinda like every time you get paid, someone gives you a check on a new piece of paper (address). If you want to spend the money, you need to take each of the checks (addresses/UXTOs) and group them together until you have enough for what you're going to send, but then this shitty analogy falls apart. :-)

I'd say if you want to consider yourself a hodler, you should have the bitcoin in a wallet you control (not your keys, not your coins and all that). You're current trusting Robinhood to not lose them, take them away, etc. If you control the keys, the only person who can make those decisions is you.

It's a random guess. I don't think it's likely.
@_date: 2019-09-24 00:14:38


It's pooooossible that the block giving the 1 confirmation could be orphaned, and then when the transaction is back in the mempool the spender could RBF it. Very, very unlikely though. 


It comes from an on-chain transaction that can be resolved on-chain again at some point in the future. It can't be done without a blockchain, that part is very important.

1. You can maybe RBF or CPFP to an address you control instead, but generally speaking you can't just undo a transaction.
2. Yes
3. Yes (edit: they can choose not to add transactions from those addresses. They can't force other miners to do the same.)
@_date: 2013-02-20 16:51:05
I think it'd be very unlikely that you'd be suspended with no appeal as a first notice for accepting bitcoin. IF it's something they have a problem with, they'd probably just end your listings that mentioned it. If you kept doing it they'd suspend you for a while, and if you kept doing it after that they'd boot you for good.
