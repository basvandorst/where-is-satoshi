I have friends like this: only buy stocks/bonds they say.
My crypto investments made me a multimillionaire.

@_date: 2018-01-04 09:21:12
Exactly. I used to feel sorry for others who didn't invest but now I just say fuck them. When I first got interested in BTC back in the day people thought I was pretty much nuts when I told them I put money into bitcoin. They would say it is a scam and similar to world of Warcraft gold. So yeah, fast forward to today, fuck those people. I'm glad they invested in their shit stock market and are still working their 9-5 job like a bunch of lemmings.

A lot of the issues with the USA are primarily our defense spending. We should not be spending all this money defending foreign countries. It is their problem if they get invaded or attacked, not ours.

It is more of a pain in the ass but honestly, I would suggest going to meetup groups, talking to other people and then doing trades with them. You can usually find someone who either wants to buy or sell. Just avoid the people who have some sort of side business going and want to buy/sell for crazy fee. Keep your transactions below a grand as well and use common sense of course. Never do any deals with anyone who talks about doing illegal stuff.
The ones in my area usually meet every month or so and there is 30-40 people there. Mostly noobs but I am sure there are some I've met who are multi-millionaires due to crypto (they'll never say it though) just by the way they act.
and like I said, yes, it is a pain the ass to do compared to coinbase or whatever but if you value privacy then it is well worth the extra effort IMO. You'll sleep better at night lol.

I agree with the above except for the FBAR. I think the FBAR is quite a stretch since bitcoin wallets aren't banks or financial accounts. They'll have to clarify though.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:26:15
Hard to really say because it all varies from bank to bank. Banks are just required to report suspicious activity. Some will think it is suspicious while others will not. Banks won't really care if you are sending money to coinbase because they know the origins of the cash. The issues come when you are getting wire transfers from coinbase. If it were me, I would never wire funds from any crypto exchange. If you want to "cash out" then spend the bitcoin instead. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:09:36
Unlikely they will go after you and if they do then it will just be in the form of a correspondence audit (ie. they send you a letter saying you owe xyz amount).
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:32:27
umm, yeah, most people don't pay tax on it or don't know how to.
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:15:46
Does anyone know WTF type of reports this service gives you?
I'm assuming they know the addresses of all the big providers. So if you bought on coinbase, they know the coins originated from coinbase and then went to your address. So they know that is your address. What about if you send the bitcoins to another address? My guess is they don't really know who owns or controls the second address. You could just be doing a bunch of fake transactions with yourself and it would look like the coins are being spent or whatever.
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:00:00
My guess is this first part is just a trial run to see how to audit crypto. After the first coinbase assignment is done they'll be going after it much more aggressively. I would advise all to stop using any centralized exchanges but that's just me.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:25:02
I guess but I don't know why anyone would ever keep their crypto in those wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:03:55
They start at 3 years and depending on how that goes, they can expand it.
@_date: 2018-09-20 06:45:20
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:40:09
yup. It is pretty much a scam ICO. You give the money, you get this "coin" that is "backed" by what they claim. Then the shit collapses after a year. Complete scam but I'm sure the socialists over there will fall for it because of nationalism.
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:04:59
i don't think you get it. The reason they put 2013-2014 is because this is when crypto was cheap. So if anyone is on that list then they're either sitting on a huge gain or were active traders. Once they have your information, they will audit your past 3 returns and they can expand it further out if you under reported by 25% gross income I believe.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:40:53
If it is so easy then why do most not report it?
@_date: 2018-09-19 22:47:10
In theory, yes. You only get your money back if the credit card agrees with you that it was fraud. You can avoid getting scammed with bitcoin by using trusted merchants of course. 
Also there are systems for bitcoin which will allow you to dispute the transaction. See openbazaar's moderator system.

@_date: 2018-06-17 04:30:53
I can understand the need for instant confirm on a point of sale transaction but the item I am buying doesn't require instant confirm. It can confirm in 2-3 hours and it is fine. At the very least, bitpay should have the merchant support two payment methods because right now this current setup is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 23:16:22
Yeah but I can't scan it because my wallet is on the computer lol
@_date: 2018-06-16 23:17:15
This merchant only uses bitpay though
@_date: 2018-06-18 08:24:55
I agree. It seems like we need something better for merchants to use or something like an open source solution instead of all these payment processors.
This bitpay seems like it is no different than paypal.
@_date: 2018-06-17 01:27:42
I said fuck it and just paid with my credit card....
I guess I'll just spend my BTC on open bazaar or something else.
We need to really get everyone on the same page if we want people to use crypto for payments because right now it seems everyone is off doing their own thing (creating all these protocols etc.) and it just make it more difficult to use and thus more barriers to people using it. No wonder the price has been steadily dropping these past few months. What a shame. I think the whole idea of just having a BTC address and sending the funds directly to that address was simple enough. I honestly don't know what bitpay is thinking by doing it some other way. Completely idiotic decision IMO.
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:29:34
When satoshi started the network for the first time, his computer crashed so he had to restart it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:24:49
IMO you can use both.
From the looks of it, BTC is going to be used as "gold" (ie. store of value only) and BCH is going to be used for doing daily trades.
People like to argue about which is better but in reality it isn't something that is mutually exclusive. Bitcoin has its attributes that make it superior to BCH and vice versa for BCH. Anyone who says otherwise is biased or has some sort of agenda.
The BCH VS BTC debate is a waste of time if you ask me because in the grand scheme of things, we all need to help to grow the crypto ecosystem. If you guys want to argue with someone, it is best to argue with the people who are anti-crypto overall.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:33:01
IMO, I think that is a bigger problem overall because the unfortunate situation is that most people in crypto right now are pure speculators who have no real interest in actually using crypto for what it was designed for. I think if the payments side of things was more developed, it would help to push the price even higher. 
It is hard to sell people on crypto when your only argument is that it is a good store of value. Lots of average joes are still operating on the whole premise that crypto is operated by some mysterious ponzi schemer. Most average people would be interested in it if it were easy to use on a payment solution. Lots of people can't get paypal accounts or similar payment processors.

@_date: 2017-11-29 19:31:12
Yup so people need to be careful. Luckily for me, I don't need the credit anymore so I pretty much just use my credit to get free perks like credit card bonuses, bank bonuses etc. My credit history looks strange (opening and closing lots of accounts, including credit cards) but I have absolutely perfect payment history so my credit score is over 825.
I make a few grand per year by doing this so it is totally worth it to me. The big ones I got this year were the $500 cash bank bonus at 100,000 UR points from chase (worth $1,500 in travel). Never paid a cent in interest or bank fees. Most I pay is like $5 if I need to wire large sums of money to other banks.

Yeah. I see BTC being like gold (store of value) while BCH is more of some sort of daily transaction coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:59:47
The issue I see with his argument is that he takes it to the absolute extreme. Sure, if you continually increase the blocksize then yes you get issues. The key is to figure out what is the OPTIMAL block size. You have to do the math to determine which is best and I think ultimately it is the market of buyer, sellers and users who will decide which is best.
Overall IMO the scaling issue is going to be solved by both on-chain and off-chain solutions and people will need to determine which is the best solution for them. In the future, it will be easy for payment terminals to automatically integrate accepting all sorts of different payments. Merchants will be able to accept thousands of different cryptos and those cryptos can be exchanged immediately for whatever store of value the business wants to hold.
Should be interesting none the less.

Just FYI for the others who are thinking of changing banks. [use doctor of credit]( to find the best bank account sign up bonus.

Personally I think the whole GPU mining thing is in a bubble right now. Eventually enough GPUs will be made to satisfy both gamer and miner demand then it will start to become a mutiny with miners fighting for the last profits. Most will just sell off their hardware and move on while others will operate a loses in the hopes of a rebound in the price of whatever they are mining. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 22:02:53
Bitcoin isn't fiat but it is money.
Requirements for money:
Medium of exchange? Yes
Store of value? Yes
Standard of deferred payment? Yes (using inflation/deflation adjusted smart contracts)
Also all the properties are there as well:
Fungibility? Yes
Durability? Yes
Portability? Yes
Cognizability? Yes
Stability of value? Yes
Do note that the stability of value means basically that 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin. Not that 1 bitcoin = $3,500. The value of fiat currencies also fluctuate (see forex). Also the stability of value does not matter because you can always dynamically adjust the price of whatever you are selling.
@_date: 2017-09-25 04:48:58
very true
@_date: 2017-09-29 07:19:12
Yeah, I agree. There are decent alt coins in the mix but you really have to dig. Anything that doesn't have something solid behind it or innovative is out immediately. Crypto like doge has the community behind it but eventually that will fade out and people will lose interest.  The alt coin needs to have either a working prototype or close to implementation of what they are proposing. The alt coins I am interested in are more of the business type ones like SIA or STORJ. At least they have working software.
Anything that is just a white paper about "we are building the next e-cash" is immediately tossed in the bin.

The problem with your theory is that there is no purpose to bitcoin if it doesn't have the core attributes of decentralized, anonymous etc.
If you want regulated crypto then you are pretty much just better off using traditional fiat currencies. I don't really see a regulated crypto taking off to any significant extent but that's just me. However, you might be correct in the sense that we will see regulated and unregulated cryptos.

I have a guy who works for me from Venezeula who does web design/programming type work. I asked him how he wants to be paid and he said bitcoin only lol. The tech people in Venezeula are already full bitcoin economy basically. The problem is traditional banking is just not accessible to them due to wire transfer fees (think of something like western union). Also traditional online money transfer is not accessible either due to the whole requirements of "know your customer" etc. There is also a bunch of currency controls in place that the domestic banks have to comply with so it just becomes a hassle. Getting a bitcoin "bank account" is as simple as downloading a wallet app. 
Another big reason he wanted to be paid in bitcoin is because you can convert bitcoin to fiat at 15-20% premium due to how many people are trying to get rid of their fiat. Though, most people who had their savings in fiat have already lost 99% of the value to inflation.
I don't think we will see a "dollarization" of Venezeula simply because the government is corrupt (desperate for cash) and the crime rate is sky high in Venezeula now. With bitcoin you have nearly absolute protection of your money that traditional fiat (including dollars) simply does not offer.

Here is the post if it gets deleted. Also I misread the post. The money was seized in Missouri, not San Francisco.


They introduce themselves as what I think I remember to be DEA. We step into a stairwell to have words. They ask to search my bags, my person, etc. I complied to all. After a few minutes of them asking what I'm doing and me asking what hell they're doing, they say they suspect me of dealing drugs. I tell them I'm not a drug dealer, that I don't do drugs, that I can pass any test they wanna give me, yada yada yada.
They keep pressing and I eventually say something to the affect of 'Is this about the cash in my bag? Did TSA see my cash and tell you guys to question me or something? I read the laws before coming here and there is nothing illegal about flying domestically with ANY amount of cash.' They said it's drug money, I told them they're wrong and I can prove it. They said the car doesn't exist, I told them they're wrong and I can prove that too. I even showed them text messages the seller and I had exchanged. They said I can't show where the money came from, I told them I can show them whatever transaction receipt they need. The money was pulled from a retirement account. I myself didn't have the physical receipt on me (because why the fuck would I?), but I assured them that my accounts manager can show them whatever the fuck they wanna see. They didn't care and took my cash anyway.
I missed my flight, was questioned for nearly 4 hours, was paraded through my hometown airport in fucking handcuffs, was charged with NOTHING, and was STILL robbed of nearly $20,000! Currently waiting to hear back from several different attorneys (it's 11:00pm where I am).
Anyone have any pro tips on how to get my money back ASAP and also sue the fucking pants off this agency? I'm not a rich man, but I'm willing to spend more than I lost if it means I win and am able to get my stolen funds back while also telling the DEA or Uncle Sam or whoever to kiss my fucking nuts.
TL/DR...DEA (I think) seized my money in what certainly seems to be an illegal seizure. Want to get my money back and hopefully get some people fired along the way.
EDIT---- they called in a search dog while I was being interrogated. The dog casually strolled past 1 bag that didn't belong to me, strolled past my bags with no reaction, and strolled past a fourth that also didn't belong to me - no reaction to any bag. The handler took the dog around the corner and out of sight, said or did who knows what, came back in the room, PHYSICALLY PICKED UP MY TWO BAGS AND SHOOK THEM A LITTLE, and then the dog walked over and basically mimicked what the handler did. The dog grabbed my bags individually, shook them around in his mouth, and was then rewarded with a treat of some sort. While waiting for the dog to arrive, the DEA guy said the dog was gonna sniff my money, not my person or whatever. I told him I'd seen a thing on Dateline or something where 4/5 bills $20 or larger tested positive for cocaine traces and that there's no way they can take my money based on a dog saying it smells like drugs. There's an 80% chance of it happening. He told me to 'shut up.' No joke.
UPDATE --- got ahold of a local attorney that offered to take the case pro bono. He said that since I can prove the money was legally earned, was withdrawn from my retirement account just a couple days ago, and that the money was all $100 bills and were still wrapped in the $10,000 bands that had the bank name and the date stamped on them, that immediately throws out the hit or whatever it's called when the dog grabbed and shook my shit. Attorney told me go get bloodwork done today to show that I'm not a drug user.
He was a prosecutor for 23 years before going into criminal defense. He said there's only like 1 or 2 scenarios where someone has a legitimate shot at suing the DEA, and that my case falls into that very unlikely category. He said I could likely expect a 100% return of the forfeiture within the next few weeks, or that we can forgo that option and instead attempt to sue the agency (which could end up taking a couple years).
Regardless, things are looking up.

This has more to do with the SEC's database getting hacked a few weeks ago. Now they have to show the public that they're going to take cyber security seriously now.
Like anything, they probably won't focus much on the bitcoin related stuff because they know it is out of their control. Okay you want to stop ICOs? Please tell me how they're going to do that for any ICO that is not based in the USA. 
Once the investor's money is in bitcoin then it is free to go wherever they please and the SEC can't do shit to stop it (assuming the ICO founders are outside of the USA).

No that won't work because the virus could sit passive and record data to bypass that method. So first time you login into the site, it will just record the relevant data it needs to reproduce the images. Then the next time you log in, it will redirect you to the fake website and show you the old data it recorded and thus the user is tricked into thinking the site is legit.

@_date: 2017-09-20 05:00:51
I hate when people make these types of arguments. The current fiat money system isn't a failure. It is working as intended in most countries.
People use bitcoin because it is a useful alternative asset class that has attributes which are not found in other assets classes.
*Easily exchangeable with other people in a relatively anonymous fashion and can trade with anyone in the world without restriction.
*Assuming adequate security procedures are followed, the crypto is virtually unseizable by anyone other than the original private key owner. You can't even say that cash has the same attribute. I'm sure eventually most people will come to realize this and when they are in a bad situation, they will surely utilize crypto currencies to protect their wealth. Even all the bitcoin haters will do it because it is better to at least be able to protect some of your wealth rather than have it all taken away for whatever reason. Think of people who are being persecuted in certain countries. Now they have the chance to flee their country without losing all their money. They can sell off whatever they have left, move it into crypto and then take off. People will try to rob them on their travels but they won't have anything that can get stolen. Another good example might be all these bitcoin miners in China. The government can seize their mining equipment but they can't seize the bitcoin wealth stored in their wallets. At least if they flee China they can still make a living abroad. Now just think of all the millions of people who live under oppressive governments. Bitcoin is a blessing to these people.
*Transaction fees are low compared with traditional remittance systems.
*Can easily move assets across borders without interference. You can't do the same thing with stocks, bonds or any traditional investment. It all has to pass through a regulator or the banks and get their final stamp of approval. If anything looks suspicious then it all get seized due to anti-money launder or anti-financial crime rules. Even if you have nothing to do with crimes, you still get caught in the net.
*Ability to have basic savings abilities for people who are stateless. Most banks will not open accounts for anyone who will not identify themselves. Crypto doesn't care, everyone gets an "account"! Something like 10-15 million illegal immigrants are located in the United States. Bitcoin is a perfect savings account for them, even with the wild fluctuation, much safer than keeping thousands of dollars of cash on hand.
*Crypto is an asset class where the supply is absolutely 100% accurate and public knowledge. The same can't be said for other asset classes which claim to be "rare" such as gold or silver. Millions and millions of new oz will be mined every year and will probably INCREASE as well as new technology gets better. Not the case with bitcoin. We know the final limit is 21 million and we know the accretion rate for the new bitcoins.
These are some of the reasons why bitcoin is valuable. Bitcoin isn't made valuable by the fiat money systems "failing". People flocked to bitcoin and similar asset classes because crypto offers unique attributes that are not found in other asset classes.

OP got a virus and it overrode the DNS settings for the website. So if he typed bittrex.com into the website url the virus redirected him to a fake server instead of the real server. It still shows up as if you are on bittrex.com. The main issues for the hackers is that they need your 2FA code since they most likely don't have access to your phone. They know you will type it into the computer though which has the virus and that's how they defeat the 2FA. 
these exchanges really need to rethink their security. I think an easy solution might be for each exchange to create an app and then require the user to input the 2FA code directly into the app instead of going through the computer. So even if your computer is compromised they won't be able to defeat the app's 2FA. They will have to figure out a way to get access to your cell phone as well.

Also for the big retailers you can use gyft.com to buy a gift card for that retailer. It is an indirect method to buy stuff with bitcoin. I personally like walmart since prices are obviously low but also they have walmart pay. You can save the gift cards to the walmart pay and next time you shop you simply use walmart pay to pay for the purchase and then it withdraws from the gift card first before using your debit/credit card. I haven't used regular fiat at walmart for months now and I shop there quite regularly.

Yeah. If they give the e-mail data then it is probably just encrypted anyways so LE can't read it anyways. Which probably explains why some agencies request the data and then never go through the formal channels to actually get it. Protonmail probably tells them that the data is encrypted and even they can't read it or decode it so the LE don't waste their time getting the actual data.

Everything was agreeing to how much per bitcoin, giving the cash and getting the bitcoin. Simple. No IDs or any other bullshit. All of my bitcoins, I bought for spot price as well, no fees. There are people who have a lot of bitcoins and are trying to cash out so it is fairly easy to find people selling.

The ICO space is mostly equivalent to the early dot com area where people were pretty much investing in ideas only. Some companies were worth hundreds of millions and then they crashed. The company never even had a dollar of revenue. The people running the company just spent all the money on "startup costs" before the investors panic sold the shares. HOWEVER, even during the dot com bubble, amazing companies were being thought of and ultimately did go on to change the world. Same thing will happen in ICOs.

I remember purchasing around $13-15/btc, can't remember the exact rate. Worth 1.5 million USD today.
Lost all the coins in a boating accident, unfortunately.
This was also after the first "mini-crash" on gox when the price peaked at $30 and dropped back to $10. People were literally going ape shit on this sub when it happened. If you use google you might be able to find some of the old posts. we also had all usual talk about how bitcoin was a ponzi or a fraud (honestly, these people never go away their arguments have not changed at all either). Also at the time I remember debating people and saying that bitcoin going to $100 was "nearly impossible". You have to imagine at the time talking about a 1,000% gain was unimaginable.
I also remember the "flash crash" on gox when someone hacked the exchange and then proceeded to mass sell all the accounts which fully wiped out all the existing [buy orders](

In his comments he said it was like 23k and his life savings. There was another guy last week that said something similar about losing a large amount of BTC to phishing attack and also mentioned it being equivalent to everything he had.
No one should have their money robbed from them but at this point it is just getting ridiculous. I wonder how many people are reading this post and have 5k+ worth of crypto in an exchange.
Honestly people, by doing stupid stuff and getting your crypto robbed from you is only doing harm to the overall bitcoin community since all the trolls always talk about how "your crypto can just vanish" and to a certain extent, they're right. At this point, we practically need to start doing public service announcements to tell people to use proper security procedures to protect themselves.

Another interesting aspect is that gold, while rare, is still mineable from the earth. Every year we get slightly better at extracting the mineral. If energy prices decline, as they have now, then it becomes cheaper to mine gold since gold mining is energy intensive. 
The beauty with bitcoin is that we have used maths to define what makes something rare. Even though bitcoin still has new bitcoins being created it is being reduced every year. The same cannot be said for gold.
Bitcoin is one of the few assets where we absolutely know the production trend 100% for a commonly traded asset.
However, the big issue is if alt coins begin to gain a similar reputation as bitcoin. People will shift their holdings to other alt coins because they simply view bitcoin as being "too expensive". This is one of the reasons why I suggest doing "share splits" to reduce the price of bitcoin. It gives the artificial illusion that bitcoin is "cheaper". For example imagine if we did a 4000:1 split. Everyone would have their bitcoins multiplied by 4,000 and the price would now trade around $1 each. The total value/market cap of the coin would stay the same. The only difference is that new holders would view bitcoin as being "cheap" and would be more inclined to put their money in bitcoin. People would rather have 1000 bitcoins rather than .25 bitcoin. even though the value is exactly the same. It would also make transaction fees easier to understand. A few of .01 bitcoin makes sense. A fee of 5,134 satoshi/byte does not. If we want bitcoin to branch out to the mainstream we need to stop using all this geek speak. It makes bitcoin confusing and not user friendly.

Also the data we have on satoshi is pretty amazing [read here](
Pretty much, Satoshi used anonymous e-mail services to conceal his identity. Even after his e-mail accounts were compromised (hacked) the hacker couldn't identify who satoshi was because all the IP addresses were TOR exit node IPs. Also since Satoshi never revealed any personal information or other "foot prints" in his digital communications it was impossible to "connect the dots" in terms of who it was. Even the anonymous e-mail service he used was able to allow users to pay via cash in the mail or money gram. From the very beginning, Satoshi was smart enough to conceal his foot prints completely. Also they tried to get the e-mail account operator to reveal how satoshi paid for the account but the owner did not keep detailed payment records.
It really shows that if you are determined to stay in a shadow of darkness, you can do it if you are careful and use the right tools. 
1. use tor
2. never speak of personal information
3. use an absolutely anonymous e-mail service that has a history of privacy for its users

The Chinese won't stop using it simply because too many people there have realized that bitcoin is something that can protect them from their government. If you read you'll see that there are lots of people in China that hate their government, they just can't openly speak out against it. They know their government is corrupt.
Also China has been devaluing their currency for quite a while now which pisses off the lower and middle classes since they are seeing the value of their fiat decline.

I have an interesting story related to this:
Back when I was in college doing my last 2 years (2012-2014), I took a finance class (basically finance 101) and some student asked about what the teacher thought about bitcoin. The teacher basically said it was 100% a scam. Bitcoin was like $20/each at the time. 
In another class (forensic accounting) another student actually gave a full 30 minute presentation to the class about what bitcoin was and how it worked. The teacher basically allowed students to give presentations for extra credit so this student gave a presentation on bitcoin. The presentation was basically a huge rave for how bitcoin is so great. When the student asked if anyone here owns any bitcoin I was like the only one who said yes. Ironically enough, the teacher said the technology sounded really interesting due to its impact on money laundering and financial crime lol.
Also ironically enough like 2 months ago an old friend from college messaged me on facebook and said "hey, I remember you talking about bitcoin back when we were in college. I just learned about it and saw the price. How much have you made off this stuff??? I need to know." and I was like "enough". lol, made my day. Good times.
On a side note for those who don't know, for people to become certified public accountants, they need to know what "blockchain" is and "cryptocurrencies" are. It is in the knowledge blueprint for must know information.

I think best option is to just use the bitcoin proceeds to subsidize your lifestyle then save 100% of your income. You'll have to get a mortgage but you'll be able to pay 100% of your regular income to the house. You can report the bitcoin sales on your tax return using the usual method.

Bitcoin isn't much different from a collectible. You buy it, hold it, it might go up or down and then you sell it. It gets more scrutiny though because of the anonymity part and the whole TOR dark net markets that use it. So I would not want it associated with my name really.
Also your statements aren't necessarily untrue. If you sold the bitcoins then held the cash in your house as a savings then you did indeed use the cash as an emergency cash savings.

I think an easier solution might be to have amazon accept bitcoin FOR GIFT CARDS. That way people could maybe buy a $200 gift card and then slowly use it over time.

It is going to put you in a bind to say the least. The banks want to know where you got the money due to anti-money laundering rules. I don't know how tech savvy the person you are dealing with is but they probably won't know much about bitcoin and if they do they will think that "bitcoin = silk road = drug money" basically. So you will have to give them some sort of explanation that covers their ass and at the same time that explanation can't be "sold bitcoins" because that statement will be viewed as "high risk" and could be used to boot you from the financing process.
Maybe you could say that you sold some old computer equipment or something? Not sure really.

Maybe it was a decoy all this time?!?! /s
@_date: 2017-07-02 03:07:01
How do people scam with it? Haven't used it personally.
@_date: 2017-07-11 00:40:35
Jokes on you, they are going to control bitcoin based on how people move their money into and out of crypto. Since the vast majority of people are using traditional bank transfers, it is all on the books.
The only people who will be spared are those who buy/sell crypto in cash.
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:19:11
True. I am just bouncing some ideas around here. You basically have to think of how most people would get cash in the first place.

The biggest irony is that ross's legacy continues on. How many dark net markets were created after silkroad went down? like 20 at least?

"cash gift from family"
Also this is the reason why you should never deposit cash into a bank account. If you have cash then just spend it at the gas station, for groceries or similar.
@_date: 2017-07-11 04:36:00
Yup, my point exactly. Sure some are going to be lost here and there but still....
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:42:34
You also can't buy a house with tens of thousands of random ass cash deposits in your bank account. They'll think you're a damn drug dealer.
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:17:42
That's a possibility. I like my cash method personally lol. You still have to make a living. The gas station or walmart doesn't ask you where you got the money. They just take it and give you the stuff you bought.

Thats a valid claim if bitcoin doesnt innovate to scale. Who cares if your bitcoin is worth $3000 if you cant spend it becuase the network is jammed or the fees have skyrocketed to huge amounts.
Thats why i always wonder the logic of people who are against increasing bitcoin capacity. Sure you will make less on transaction fees on a per transaction basis but if the network is now doing 10x the transactions then the total value of all fees will increase.

Right, when I was using bitcoin back in the day it was great. Low fees and confirmation in 10 mins. Bitcoin was designed to be modified to allow for scaling yet here we are having a full blown war on if increased transaction capacity should be added? Increased capacity means better usability for the end-user which means more people will want to use it and if more people are using it then it means the price will go even higher.
Also people have options. If bitcoin can't scale then we will go to litecoin or some other altcoin that can handle the capacity and we will abandon bitcoin. Simple as that. Some of you guys don't really get that point.

Problem is that government controls the police, army etc so they can use fear to make people use their crypto.
@_date: 2017-06-25 07:31:13
Oh got it, I was thinking of it backwards.
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:20:15
I guess but seems like a hassle. Rather just get paid straight in BTC. I was thinking of going to local universities that have CS/engineering departments and posting up some flyers or something.
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:40:16
I am looking for people who already have the BTC in their wallets. I would be doing a month to month type deal.

Can anyone ELI5 what it means by 40mb data left in the mempool? I know what the mempool is.
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:13:21
Why do you ask?
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:57:27
Also the users decide if they even want to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:38:15
Oh, got cha. Wish I could help you out =/

And they also think the stuff backing their fiat is not the same thing that backs bitcoin. It is all about faith and trust. If people lose trust in bitcoin or fiat then it goes to zero. People are under the false impression that fiat is a guarantee of value.
@_date: 2017-06-29 23:24:09
of course
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:37:50
Right so why does it say 40 mb "left" or is that referring to how many unconfirmed transactions to process?
@_date: 2017-06-24 05:29:54
You should have been here when it was at $1,337. Those were the days!
or should I say, that was the 10 minutes, because after that it went to the moon. A mere coincidence? I think not!
