Every day I see a new problem with coinbase...  Is it reliable at all? Really worried about the security of my money, here. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:38:53
I want to hear from people I trust here in Reddit,  not from the people that have an interest in taking my money. I guess I should've been more clear. Don't know what I can actually rely on 
@_date: 2015-06-17 14:55:28
People keep telling me how safe it is to invest... 
@_date: 2015-12-22 21:14:57
Lol your opinions LITERALLY dont matter since you have no effect on the outcome of the election. Grow the fuck up, literally
@_date: 2015-12-22 13:57:41


Yeahhhhh I'm glad you can't vote yet. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:20:40
I'm trying to but everyone is just laughing at me while saying "coinbase! coinbase!" 
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:37:41
No one local/no atms. I am not in California or Oregon like half of this sub seems to be. 
Will circle or coinbase actually work? I'm constantly seeing this sub mention issues with both. I don't want my money in escrow somewhere and I don't want to wait multiple days. 
Any assistance would be appreciated. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 21:09:32
Does circle work in USA? 
@_date: 2015-12-14 04:29:35

Please point to where I was "emotional?" 
I was pointing out where you were "wrong." 
Sorry you got butthurt about your orange fuhrer acting like a fool again.

Its not a "shock term." The president of the United States, as well as the white house press secretary, called it a "Muslim Ban" several times this week before it even went through. 
Are you part of trump's media team that wants to pretend the press started calling it that prior to the president? 
It's a Muslim ban. Get your head out of the sand, dummy.

... 
I know I'm going to get downvoted, but this is why I still don't own bitcoin. 
I come in here a few months ago asking where u can buy some, everyone lists a bunch of random markets. One by one, sketchy articles began coming out about them all, and soon they all began showing their true faves as scams. 
So...  I'll ask again (if anyone even cares,) where the hell can I buy some bitcoin without thinking/assuming I'm just throwing my money at a con artist? 
@_date: 2017-02-03 20:17:37
Haha you really know when you've been beaten, I guess. 
Youre the guy that screams at a whispering person "CALM DOWN SIR, CALM DOWN!" you should just sucking that trump dick, never read a newspaper or listen to anyone other than your divine leader; you're too far gone from society anyways.

You said "salty" in a context where it doesn't even apply...  You can't tell someone to " leave high school" when you yourself have literacy problems.

No, I think you're a faggot who wants to try and show off to strangers like a total douchebag.  Go learn what "salty" means, cocksucker

A hundred hours is barely enough to get your license in many countries....... 
So again, I'm going to assert that you recently got your license (especially if you can still count the amount of hours you've driven) and that you've never driven in bad weather. You're probably a 17 year old from California. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 19:46:44
Most places use a comma, not a decimal....  I hope you understand all the confused downvotes. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:53:58
As a result of a loss...... 
Youre trying to use it as "jealous" or something which doesn't apply, nor am I. Simply stating that OP is a fucking douche for trying to brag to strangers. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 08:24:03
You sound like someone who just got their license and has never experienced bad weather.

But when MS/Apple stock became THIS valuable, it kind of stopped growing...  Even at Best, could you really imagine Bitcoin being more than 2x as valuable as it is now?

It is a very rarely accepted defense, and a situation where you are safely at home on your computer would not apply.

Are you just...  It owing everything said to you? He literally JUST explained why it's NOT good for small transactions. 
Are you arguing that what he said  was not true? 
Are you arguing that somehow, 25% is smaller than 3%?

I'm sorry but these are the kind of things that scare people away from bitcoin. 
Want to be better than a CC? Be faster than one. 
I'm not trying to whine but this is a BIG fucking problem, and we want bitcoin to work so badly that we ignore it. 
@_date: 2016-09-22 02:27:00
If you're being serious, I'd love a source. 
Every "fact" Sanders gave in the debates, when contested, was NEVER given an origin or a basis for the number. This is the kind of stuff that turns a candidate, and an ideology, into a joke. 
Oh...  And the failure of literally *every* socialist Republic to have ever existed.....

Ignorant, please explain. 
I though bitcoin was banned in NY? So they get it banned and simply start another service, legally, that does the same thing, while criminalizing bitcoin? Am I missing something? 
@_date: 2015-10-05 14:10:07
Can someone extrapolate on the "really hard to get licensed" part? 
Also why everyone in this sub simply phrases it "you can't use bitcoin in NY," all the outrage over the laws passed a few months ago, etc etc 
@_date: 2016-05-24 15:42:09
But coin is a pain in the ass. The block chain is bloated. Hate me all you want, but these are two very good reasons I don't care to ever use bit on again. Something new and simple is needed
