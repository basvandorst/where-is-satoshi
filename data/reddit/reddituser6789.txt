Crypto could drop another 80% and GPU mining would still be profitable on most high end cards without any adjustment in mining competition/difficulty.

Are you being sarcastic?
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:50:51
Yea dude. It’s called money. It’s a representation of economic value. Hate to break it to you here - your fiat money doesn’t generate value either. In fact, it loses value every year by design.

Long-term, hopefully a currency. For now, it is more just a store of wealth.

Depends on what you mean by bubble... 
Is it concerning how many people are buying without even understanding what they’re buying? Yes.
Is bitcoin overvalued? That depends on what bitcoin will become. If it is on a path to become the leading global currency, this price is a little bit of a joke. If it’s not going to enter that conversation, then yes, this feels unsustainable. I think it all comes down to whether we all get comfortable with the idea as a currency or digital gold. If you’re not making a calculated risk based around that thesis, then yes, you’re probably just gambling at this point.

4m per requires it to become the dominant currency of the world by a wide margin. So your skepticism is obviously fair. But perhaps it’s worth allowing some room for the possibility of such a thing.

Yes, said that backward, but relative deflation of bitcoin (I.e. rising price against fiat) is not the same as good and services being priced in bitcoin, and it taking more and more fiat currency to have the same buying power for the same goods and services.

He’s suggesting you misunderstand the meaning of ecological, which seems to be the case given your response.

Given the username, I’m really hoping this devolves into some sort of flat earth tirade...
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:23:43
It does imply that either (a) it is rapidly being adopted as the preferred global currency and fiats are rapidly deflating against it (in a truer sense than just the relative inflation of bitcoin rising) or (b) bitcoin forks have evolved in multiple use cases (microtransactions, privacy coin, smart contract platform, etc.) that all create new value or take market share from an incumbent competitor (and assuming you hold all these forks). The question would be whether both of those theses are absurd. Perhaps they are, but I think if either of those things happen, $21 trillion is feasible or even exceedable.

Every community needs there crazies. I’d still suspect BTC has a lower ratio of crazies than BCH. There’s just a much bigger BTC community.

They’re a custodian. They can’t use customer crypto to pay their own bills. Well, they can if they want to go to jail.

Welcome to the internet in 2018 where people state their uneducated opinions like they’re facts. Go read the money transmission laws that Coinbase is regulated under and then come back and tell me it’s “Bullshit” that there are laws against them touching their customer’s crypto. Until then, fuck off.

Ver went on Alex Jones? Lol. This shit just keeps getting funnier. I almost feel bad for the bitcoin cash community at this point, except they’re so frustratingly irrational and arrogant at the same time that it’s hard to feel bad.
@_date: 2018-03-03 15:12:45
That was Japan. Coinbase is a licensed money transmitter. There are laws against them touching their customer’s crypto.

He never suggested otherwise. Read what he actually wrote and stop implying shit. It’s annoying, especially after he already called the first person out for doing the same thing, and you double down with the same nonsense.

I think we’re going to h e to accept ASICS for the hashing power efficiencies it can provide and work on decentralization through trying to further decentralize ASICs. Samsung will help. And mini versions that have comparable efficiencies (if this is possible) would help. Like that little router thing bitmain sells for litecoin mining, although I don’t know how competitive it is. Or maybe all the utility power stations of the world throw otherwise wasted electricity into miners, and we live in a world where those are all decentralized too. 
Anyway, I think this is an issue worth taking seriously, but a bit overblown in the short term.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:05:23
Agree with all of that, except I’d say inflation primarily robs people with cash assets, which the “common man” generally doesn’t have.
But yea, the whole thing is a shit show.

Being a con man makes him a con man. And stop with the name calling. It’s only undermining your objective here, unless your objective is to just be an annoying troll - in which case, you’re doing great.

“Application Specific” vs. “general purpose”. Turns out , we like using computers for more than just bitcoin mining.

Gold’s value is multiples of its intrinsic value. It’s a store of value - a social technology. Gold, fiat, crypto... these are all collective fictions that we agree upon to make it easier to transfer economic value. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:00:48
I didn’t downvote you, fwiw. I was just trying to understand what you were saying. 
This makes more sense, although I’m not sure I’d agree with it. But I don’t claim to be an expert in decentralized systems, so I’d be curious what others think too.
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:46:49
That’s fair. But this is the transition phase we need. Merchants aren’t comfortable holding crypto yet. But the longer it’s here and the more the ecosystem gets built out, that should start to change. The relative advantages over fiat are real. The biggest issue is likely value fluctuation, but the central banks are going to handle that for us with these absurd debt ratios. We’ll see how scary crypto volatility looks when the USD and other major currencies start to hyper-inflate lol.
