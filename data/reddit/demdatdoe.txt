Since when have these been rolling out? 
@_date: 2014-07-28 19:15:14
is that 90% statistic accurate?

apples over the internet, how would you make sure they would arrive fresh..?

that day when you read something and your just like ...woah were living in the future

never trust promises made in the midst of a bubble I suppose
@_date: 2014-07-08 16:36:47
robocoin is right in the middle of everything but that palm scan is frightening...
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:00:18
Its the tragedy of the commons all over again...human nature has shown that a common resource will be destroyed if it is an individuals benefit to exploit it, regardless of the consequences if everyone does so

Ah so excited!!!  Finally can actually live off being my own bank...no ridiculous workarounds like people currently living off of btc use lol

If he was so concerned with privacy why would is online handle be his real goddam name?
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:40:07
Agreed.  The average person (and even the tech literate) gets viruses, password compromised, etc on occasion.  For bitcoin to be adopted these are problems that will have to be addressed in a way that still allows ease of use.  I imagine 2FA is the biggest solution currently.  Multisig is just too complicated for the average user

Donated a couple of bucks thanks for the match :D
@_date: 2014-07-30 18:58:26
steady growth? *cough*
@_date: 2014-07-28 17:09:07
Depends on the brand of atm.  In general, you should have a smartphone with a wallet app installed (i'd personally reccomend mycelium if you have an android device, pheeva if an ios device but heres plenty of options).  You'll have to go with cash, possibly undergoe a registering process depending on the atm and then hoild your phone to a scanner to receive the coins.

&lt;s&gt;A billion dollars per coin&lt;/s&gt;

Personally it's the sentiment "Oh when X happens price will go up" that bothers me.  We, participators in the Bitcoin community, need to focus on Bitcoin's potential rather than dumping it when given the chance.
Bought in at 600 USD and don't regret anything.  Even if we go to ten cents a coin...I recognized that what I was buying was a risky asset. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 08:01:25
Never been happier that a subreddit doesn't exist...
@_date: 2014-09-10 21:47:59
Except everyone can understand the use for instant mail, not everyone can understand the use for instant money...to consumers money seems to move instantly
@_date: 2014-09-09 21:56:19
Yup 100 percent correct.  However bitcoin isn't about just payments, its about being to control your own wealth that isn't fiat and that isn't an IOU on a bank ledger somewhere
@_date: 2014-07-28 19:14:48
If by UI he meant general user interactions with the system I would agree with him.  and blockchain bloat is a problem, with only ~8000 nodes as another poster said a smaller blockchain would g a long ways to foster more bitcoin nodes to operate.

Thanks for matching drak!  9 btc is a lot of money and considering you drove the fundraising a lot of props to you (especially for matching).  Ill try to donate more in a couple of months when i get a paycheck..
@_date: 2014-07-30 20:25:26
That's awful, are you sure that just wasn't a default miner fee that you can change?
@_date: 2014-10-07 17:11:29
Its a joke about Draper's proposal to split california into 6 states haha
@_date: 2014-07-25 15:08:18
Yea.  in particular id love to see any cases where western union makes more sense
@_date: 2014-08-24 22:56:50
wow thats a bad site name...sato shit an go
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:59:32
I'm assuming coinbase's security/redundancy is far higher than that of a scrap of paper stored at the home of the average person
@_date: 2014-07-08 16:35:56
the lamussu at the black star cafe?  Used that rather than the robocoin due to privacy issues, had a great experience.  Except for the fact that the cafe doesnt have public wifi for some reason....
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:03:14
Honestly this a symptom of the incentives of mining, considering the lack of adequate ways to fix this is the biggest concern I have for the bitcoin protocol
@_date: 2014-08-13 16:09:29
Dam, love to see how this plays with the recent debt crisis they've been having..
@_date: 2014-07-21 18:30:14
The analogy is pretty spot on, just as navigating to google.com and not 165.34.54.234 helped bring the internet to the world at large, so will doing so with bitcoin further its possibility of adoption.
@_date: 2014-07-23 20:59:10
"set" to repeat? There is no timing the market my friend
@_date: 2014-07-03 18:33:51
No mistake, your english is perfect
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:36:47
Yea when people talk about the price of the coin they are literally  insane.  Could go back down to 10 cents a coin for all we know, the only thing we do know is that it has a use case as a ways to store and transmit wealth
@_date: 2014-09-22 13:59:04
Away from home now but will donate a few bucks in a couple of hours and comment back here when I do.  Btw finishing up school (comp sci) and looking for the next thing to do, how was your experience at the squat in London?
@_date: 2014-09-11 18:53:44
I had a great experience with the Lamassu at the Black Star pantry south Sydney.  Only problem was the cafe didn't have Wifi (what cafe doesn't have wifi??" so I had to use the in store private key printer to get my bit coins as I could''t install a wallet on my phone without wifi not having a data connection
@_date: 2014-07-22 20:27:08
Seriously man.  Attempting to encourage moderation is key to preventing the circlejerk that happens here sometimes
@_date: 2014-09-10 14:06:38
Good question.  Will be interesting to see the price play out in e next year with this development thank god I only invested a few hundred...
@_date: 2014-07-30 18:50:48
What are we teenage girls?  Its a technology you're talking about not a person....
@_date: 2014-07-03 14:05:06
Can anyone explain to me what circle is trying to accomplish?
@_date: 2014-07-28 14:33:29
I'll be sure to.  Bitcoin price doesn't have to go up just because it is good technology.
@_date: 2014-07-28 14:31:54
TA is short term for day trading largely, go on r/bitcoinmarkets and see that many thought a bubble was going to hit in july that didn't.
@_date: 2014-07-28 17:40:59
Debit card is not offered as a payment option yet to my understanding.  And smartphone wallet is pretty secure, unless your storing large amounts (above the 100 $ USD range) where I'd then move most of the coins you bough later to a secure computer with a wallet backup.  Check the sidebar for better information then I can give you.
it's not as confusing as it sounds! just need a few minutes of reading

"biggest slovenian gold dealer" is one of the stranger terms I've heard today...

"Imagine if everyone had a well, water would then be completely decentralized."
Ummm, what about cities, contaminated well water, lowering of the water table, cost of installation of the well, etc....
@_date: 2014-07-28 17:09:45
I mean...obviously...
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:40:44
Awesome!  Made [this word cloud]( to get a feel for the hearing.

You can find a prepaid cheap smartphone on craigslist for very cheap (sub 50 dollars).
@_date: 2014-07-28 18:10:18
Its important!  Constructive criticism is huge for any technology
@_date: 2014-07-28 18:07:51
Just highlights the need for the simplified user experiences that are rolling out with mobile wallets I've beens seeing recently. Apples relaxation of their rules has been huge 
@_date: 2014-07-30 20:24:53
I couldn't find any fees...is there any?
