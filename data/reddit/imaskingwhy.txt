Yes, you do. From CNBC today :
As Congress voted on the tax bill this week, investors pulled $14.5 billion from equities funds and ETFs, the fourth largest on record and the most since the weeks after Brexit, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Bond funds saw their biggest outflows in a year, with high-yield funds losing $5.3 billion in an eighth week of losses.
The BofAML strategists said the trades in the week ended Wednesday did not translate into "Trump trade," with funds exiting financials, small-caps and value funds, all sectors that should benefit from lower taxes. But they say that supports a bullish trade for January 2018.

Let's say all the industrial miners disappear. One moment...POOF!...all gone. All that's left is one guy with an old Antminer U2+ running at 2.2GH/s and hooked up to his computer. Less than 2016 blocks later, the difficulty with adjust to the new hashrate (total network hashrate: 2.2GH/s). And that one guy will be collecting 3600 BTC a day. What if he wanted to sell them all? Would you still say the same things about a solo miner as you do about industrial miners?
Mining has to happen, mining is more efficient on a large scale, etc. It's not about "industrial miners". It's not even about "most mined BTC being sold on the market ASAP in exchange for fiat". And if you're right, then in 2016 when the reward halves we should see a huge increase in price, right?

Wrong. People mine at a loss for speculative purposes or so that they can get bitcoins without having to go through banks, credit cards, exchanges, etc. Reducing it to "miners will shut down machines once they're not making a profit in fiat" is only one aspect of the whole mining ecosystem.

I'm polyamorous. I could see having a smart contract on a blockchain where the current members of a relationship would use a multisig private key and could add/remove members and the relationship could be viewed publicly. While I think the blockchain in general is a great idea, Bitcoin isn't really up to this task, I don't think; even in this instance, it seems to be a two-party transaction. But this is interesting nonetheless!
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:15:00
Mining is one of the basic fundamentals of Bitcoin. Why people seem to ignore it, I have no idea. I'm in agreement: for many miners, around $330-ish is where they stop being able to pay for their power (hardware costs are something else). I think the potential difficulty decrease is an indicator of exactly that: people are shutting down miners. (Or was that BFL going down? We may never know.)

The human mind likes dichotomies. Lots and lots of things end up as "us vs. them", "A vs. B", etc. That could be one explanation.
I've seen this before in other so-called "idealistic experiments" (don't kill me for this; it seems to be a good phrase for Bitcoin and other things). For example, I speak Esperanto. Often, when I mention that, people say something like "Oh, that failed" or they go insane and start getting all worked up, asking me "WHY ARE YOU WASTING YOUR TIME?! LEARN SOMETHING USEFUL LIKE SPANISH!" Sometimes they're honest and say "I don't know what that is" or "I don't know much about it, so tell me more". I walk away from the former people and talk in more detail to the latter. I basically have an MA in Linguistics and I still can't really understand why some people get all pissed off at other language communities, but they do. *shrug* I'm sure economists could say something similar about Bitcoin.

1) Bitcoin is still a "techy" thing. That's slowly changing, but for now it's a technical thing.
2) People who visit computer repair companies are very often not techy. Otherwise, they'd be fixing their own computers (in most cases).
3) The midwest is called "flyover country" for a reason. Trends often start on the coasts and migrate inland (with the exceptions of certain "islands" comprised of very large cities like Denver, Dallas, and Chicago).
I'd bet many of those 10% either have jobs in financial sectors, read WSJ or watch Bloomberg often, or do some sort of non-hardware technical work. And I agree; whoever said "everyone has heard" is definitely wrong.

First, always gauge the actual level of interest that the questioner has. Are they simply saying "I heard this word on the news and don't know what it is"? Are they saying "I know someone who made some money with it and I'm interested in seeing if I want to invest"? Are they saying "I heard it's a new economic model and I'm into that sort of thing"?
Once you have their level of interest, you know how much info to give them: "It's a digital currency." "Well, it's very volatile and experimental, but if you're interested, I could send you a few links." "It's definitely interesting. Let me send you a few links."

Easier said than done. High-frequency trading—at least using some sort of blockchain solution—seems impossible to me, even with super fast block times. There may be other solutions, though. Now, slower exchanges, yes. For example, both NXT and Bitshares have decentralized exchange solutions so far.

I'm going to get downvoted, I'm sure (this IS a bit off-topic), but there ARE ASIC-resistant cryptocurrencies (e.g. Darkcoin which uses X11). They probably won't be ASIC-free for long (someone estimated 2 years until there could be an X11 ASIC), but...*shrug*

I'm butting in. Take what I say with a shaker full of salt. From the font of all knowledge:
"market liquidity is a market's ability to facilitate an asset being sold quickly without having to reduce its price very much (or even at all). Equivalently, an asset's market liquidity (or simply "an asset's liquidity") is the asset's ability to sell quickly without having to reduce its price very much. Liquidity is about how big the trade-off is between the speed of the sale and the price it can be sold for. In a liquid market, the trade-off is mild: selling quickly will not reduce the price much. In a relatively illiquid market, selling it quickly will require cutting its price by some amount." (Wikipedia)
Example one: Yes, you are providing liquidity, but it's hidden. It's in the "dark pool", in a way, but you didn't pay the extra fee to Bitfinex to hide it. You quickly click return, selling your asset, when needed. 
Example two: If you have no intention of selling, does that mean you'll drop the wall if the price hits it? If so, then no, you aren't providing liquidity. I'm not an economist, but doesn't the idea of a sell wall go against this definition of liquidity anyway? Now, a buy wall, on the other hand...
Example three: You are not providing liquidity, at least right now. You will be once your personal goals are met (if they ever are, and that's the kicker, I think).
I'm talking out my ass. But hey, it's discussion, as you requested. :)

Are these the small USB units, a couple of inches long? If so, they go for $10-15 each on eBay.

To be honest, trying to sell them for groceries will probably be a losing proposition.

"dragging consumer interest down at the same time"
1) Ask someone on the street if they've heard of Bitcoin. The number which say "yes" probably hasn't changed in the past couple of weeks.
2) More places are accepting Bitcoin for transactions. The sellers have to be there before the buyers want it.

No. As a linguist, this is a bad idea. Changing terms is a big deal and could reduce adoption.
Metric works just fine (and I'm an American :) ).
1 BTC
1 dBTC
1 cBTC
1 mBTC
1 μBTC
This isn't hard. It amazes me how language is so strong for people. It's one of the reasons I became a linguist. And here we are, talking about a standard worldwide currency, but you want to add some non-standard (i.e. non-metric) term. If we're going to standardize, let's standardize!
And here, I'll prove my language point:
I speak Esperanto. We should all speak Esperanto, because it would simplify communication a thousandfold.
Now, let's tweak that:
I use Bitcoin. We should all use Bitcoin, because it would simplify financial transactions a thousandfold.
I use the metric system. We should all use the metric system, because it would simplify measurement a thousandfold.
I'll bet you got riled up by the Esperanto one, but not the other two (unless you're a conservative American, then the last one probably made you think of Communists or something :P ).
tl;dr: No. Use metric units. Everyone else does.

More people will get into mining when BTC is worth more. BTC will be worth more when people use it more.

Right now, only large mining ventures are reasonable, it seems.

Frankly, testing the equipment is a requirement. I'm not going to buy something that hasn't been tested. And I have no problem with a mining equipment company testing them on the live network and making a few cents; that may even help keep the hardware cost lower for the buyer. But running them for more than, say, 24-48 hours is extreme, I agree.

This brings up huge questions concerning Bitcoin's fungibility. That's a dark road. I want scammers and thieves caught, too, but the question is: where do you draw the line? What right does an exchange have to stop a user from using coins in their possession? And what kind of possession really matters? Et cetera.
Let's say we find some stolen coins and someone (a volunteer?) tries to return them to their owners. Let's say there are 3% of the coins for whom we can't find the owners. What do we do? Blacklist those coins as "dirty"? Give them to a charity? It gets messy, IMO. And almost no one will be happy with whatever answer there is.

So where do you trade so those of us who are tired of crappy platforms can increase liquidity somewhere that actually works?

So, wait:
"As always, CoinWallet clients will be unaffected by the test. More details will be posted publicly when the test is imminent."
So, this is a DDOS attack on both the network in general and on your competitors, too. Do you realize that a Bitcoin testnet exists?

*golf clap* Very nice.

The parts I consider the most important:

Why all the crazy pictures? It's like they're trying to make the article—and its subject matter—seem like a joke.

I don't get it. How did they "miss the crux"? They talk about forking and what it is (remember, not everyone knows!) and that someone forked Core. So...that's crux-y, in my eyes.

Nice deflection. ;) I caught your earlier reply about OKCoin, though. I was replying that, based on a few things I've read, I don't think I like what I've heard there, either. Positives I've heard about include BitMEX and Kraken. Frankly, at this point, I think that while liquidity is important, I want an exchange that actually works. Thank you for your reply.

No, but some other cryptocurrencies provide incentives to do so. I think it would be a good idea to provide some small amount to node hosts every so often.

This is definitely an exponential curve, as you say. Would your docs be aimed towards those who are cryptography-saavy programmer types? Or are you aiming them towards users? Or everyone? Your ranking will be different based on that. This one is mixed, from "not even on the chart" to "Satoshi himself".

It hiccuped for a few minutes Now it's back to where it was and volatility is back down to almost nothing.

Well, you can do after-hours trading, but liquidity is lower. You can trade Forex 24/5, so that's almost all week.
My issue is that you can get all sorts of data from Bitcoin exchanges, like order book details, that you pay extra for from forex or stock exchanges. We're spoiled in some ways.

Oh, I agree. And I think that's a benefit. But it also draws in amateurs, programmers who think "this is simply a technical issue that I can solve", and people who really have no clue about finance or business. I think that's a lot of the problem.
I sincerely believe that cryptocurrencies in general are amazing, and Bitcoin being the largest has the largest portion of my attention in that space (although I'm following a few more for technical or political reasons).
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:03:37
I tried. Bitfinex's trading engine prevented it.

What process? It now says "[REDACTED]"?

Maybe he/she/they already has/have, and you just don't know it yet.
Metal hat engaged!

Oh, and feel free to toss me some BTC for that suggestion. :)

 maybe?
