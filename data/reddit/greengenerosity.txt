Buy 1 BTC and sell 0.5 within one year and 0.5 after one year means you pay short term taxes on first sale and long term taxes on the second sale.  
Every sale, spending, exchanging of Bitcoin is a taxable event.  
You take the price you paid for the original 0.5, subtract that from the price you sell it for, you pay taxes on the difference.

Thanks for the the information about ISK. Super friendly for retail investors, buy/sell whatever you want in the ISK account at any time without having to deal with taxes.  
You basically pay 1.5%, or the standard interest, on your holdings every year without capital gains tax. If the standard interest go up it becomes more costly. If everything in the account is lost there is no capital losses. The fee is paid no matter how the performance is in the year.  
The ISK account has the added benefit of actually guarding the assets in it from inflation tax. Investments that maintain their purchasing power will get a 1.5% fee every year. The same investment with 3% inflation and 30% tax in a regular account would translate to an effective 1% fee in comparison and full capital gains taxes.  
If you plan on not trading on leverage and long term I don't see any reason to use a ETP, especially if it is something that is reliant on a company not going under.

If you send the Bitcoin to someone, it is gone forever unless it is a legitimate service.  
If the address you sent to have other previous transactions on it, you likely sent to a scam.  
I the customer service asks you to send more Bitcoin or anything else it is is a scam.  
With regular payments you can reverse the payment, put in a dispute, but with Bitcoin it is irreversible.

Governments like the US do legislate to make the distribution of reproduction and sex more equal than it would be if people were free to chose. That is why polygamy is illegal. Not because there is any moral or ethical argument against it, but because the societies that allow men to marry multiple wives tend to become more violent and unstable since there is a lot of men that loses access to establishing families.  
The argument for wealth redistribution is the same, it is a pragmatic consideration. Income inequality growing to large to fast will be more costly on net because of the effects it will have on society as a whole.

Every standard non-custodial wallet is anonymous by default, it is just a program that handles the private/public keys.  
The Bitcoin ledger is public and permanent, so unless you got a way to buy/sell Bitcoin without any traces to your ID it can be traced back to you. The wasabi wallet lets you mix your coins with other coins after you get them to find the origin of coins, but if you buy/sell with your ID then at the very least you will risk being taken for tax evasion or not being able to demonstrate where your income is from.  
There is no Bitcoin wallet that is safer than the internet connected device it is on, if you want to safely store Bitcoin you need to put in in cold storage, and the safest way to do that is with some hardware wallet.

If you don't live in the US the laws might be different. But when you say ETF I think you might mean something else since there is (Correct me if wrong) not Bitcoin ETF. There might be accounts that claim they are ETFs, but could be a fraud.  
1.5% yearly fee on a Bitcoin fund sounds reasonable, I can't see how there is a 30% capital gains tax on 1.5% of the price of something like an ETF, but you are probably outside the US.

If someone does not think something is a delusion they say: I do not think it is a delusion. (Or in this case: No longer think it is a delusion.)  
Adding in the "Complete" part of delusion serves only one purpose, to imply that it is a partial delusion, at the very least keep the door open to it and not being willing to say that it is not a delusion.  
You saying that you no longer think I am completely wrong does not mean you think I am completely right.

Depends on where you live, but assuming the US.  
The cost basis was originally $10  
You sold for $100  
You have realized $90 in capital gains, short term.  
If you sell the coins for $1 this year you will have realized $99 capital loss.  
Which puts your total for the year at $9 in realized capital loss.  
If you do not sell/trande/spend the coin after it falls to $1 in 2019 you owe taxes on the $90 you realized, which could be something like %25 on that amount. If you sell the coin for $1 the next year you will have realized a capital loss of $99 that year and save taxes on that loss.  
Every time you sell/trade/spend crypto you will realize some gain/loss.  
The main difference is the length you hold the coins before you sell them, if they are held for over 1 year it qualifies at a lower tax rate as it is long term.  
How taxes is calculated depends if you use one of two methods, "First in First Out" or "Last in First Out", which you may be able to chose.  
To comply with taxes in the US you need to keep a complete record of every coin, every trade, every address/transaction/time/value.  
The costbasis is what you bought/traded/earned the coin for, and the realized gains is what you sold/spent/traded the coin for minus the cost basis.  
It is very important to set aside money for taxes in the US, because if you get a gain of $100k 2019, then a loss of $100k in 2020 you will owe taxes on the full $100k gain, but you will only be able to deduct $3k per year in capital gains tax for the loss, and any tax you are not able to pay (because you lost it all the next year) will be debt with a relatively high interest.

I would love to hear the original clip since to my knowledge it has only been reported and some of the original reporting has factual errors like implying that Bitcoin is pegged to the dollar.  
The overall point that he makes is not about Bitcoin specifically but the way that blockchain can open up for a lot of innovation in the financial industry, he sees the post 2008 period as hamstrung by regulations.  
He is on the advisory board of a Ampleforth which has their own crypto which is trying to mimic money with a stable price. That is likely an example of where he thinks that a currency based on blockchain could have a use case since he advises it.  
He never hints towards Bitcoin being suited as a currency, only that it will not go to zero because it attracts people that is interested in the qualities of it, not as a currency, but as something that people can speculate in and use as a non-correlated asset.  
 “I was very wrong, wrong to think there was **no… use for a form of currency** based on **blockchain technology,**”   
He would likely say that there is no use for Bitcoin as a currency.  
 *"I don't think this will turn out to be a complete delusion."*   
He phrases it another way by saying that Bitcoin is a long way from zero, and I think his prediction about it not being a complete delusion is an admission that his standard for complete delusion is that it goes to practically 0. Which he no longer thinks will happen. Which is what his "a bit like an option on digital gold" implies, something people speculate on the price of but does not actually use as a currency, the fact that it is not correlated with other asset classes itself gives it some value for speculators.

People should not get involved in crypto unless they have a good reason for it and a personal interest in it. There is no reason to try to get people involved in it to get them to put money into something that is extremely speculative and priced based on supply and demand alone.  
It is hard to avoid scammers, fraudulent exchanges and securing securing the private keys, not to mention avoiding any user errors for a novice. Most people who came into crypto because of FOMO in 2017 left with a bad taste in their mouth.  
The 2017 price bubble is not something that should be seen as a good thing. For anyone that want to have stateless money it is not good that there is speculative bubbles in general, the long term goal for Bitcoin is to have roughly the same amount of buyers and sellers so that the price remains relatively stable and people can chose to be their own bank with all the risks and responsibilities that it entails.  
People should at the very least be told that the price of Bitcoin is a gamble and that the price is virtually only based on speculation, that nobody can win without an equal opposite loss.

It is possible to estimate the rough number of machines that was used to mine using the historical hashrate and the performance of the hardware at the time.  
A High-range retail CPUs could do about 10MH/s and at the start of 2010 the network hash was about 10MH/s,it grew to 20x the first half of 2010, then in midl/late 2010 GPU miners came along which gave a substantial boost.  
AMD 6990 which came out in December 2010 could mine 865 MH/s.  
2011 started out with 100 GH/s or about 100+ high-end GPUs and ended on 10 TH/s, somewhere above 10 000 high-end GUps.  
The Hashrate was pretty stable for the whole of 2012, starting at 10TH/s and ending on 20TH/s.  
So for that period beginning 11 to end 12, there was only around 10 000+ high-end GPUs, not growing after mid 2011 when it first reached 10GH/s.  
In the beginning of 2013 the ASIC miners, then the price shot up 100x the same year, and we have the ASIC mining farms pulling in a couple million in mining revenue every day now.

The fee sum of transactions needs to be high enough, each individual transaction does not need to be high.
It is not necessary to switch from POW to POS even if fees gets smaller by introducing a tail emission that does not decrease if block rewards get to small to deter attacks and double spends.
Something like switching from POW to POS would be an example of the social mechanism instead of the technological deciding.

I do not think that it is possible. To properly secure the private keys a person needs to have an interest in adding in some extra complexity in their life that is extremely unforgiving.  
There is no safe hot wallet to begin with since it is not safer than the online device it is connected to, only spending cash that can be lost without worry can be put in it.  
Cold storage works for anyone who is either tech savvy enough to set up an always offline sandbox or device and the right software (or willing to buy a legit hardware wallet), generate the seed, confirm it by recovering it, and then manage to store and secure them over time without anyone finding them, while at the same time making sure that in case of accident or death that they are shared. In addition to having to keep the crypto holdings secret, especially if they reach a certain size.  
But having any sizable portion of savings in Bitcoin is stressful for anyone that does not handle volatility and risk, even if everything else was taken care of.  
Bitcoin (at least personally securing private keys, cold storage + non-custodial hot wallets / LN) will always be a very niche thing for especially interested people. It is not and can never be for everyone, or even most people.

The fee estimation can at best be about probabilities and it can only look at the average/median in the near past.  
More sophisticated models could take in data from the world that is is correlated with higher transaction counts, like the fee increasing when the price/volume goes up some at a certain rate.  
The simple estimator would be some percent over/under the median fees for the last block(s) that got accepted.

Best advice is to not invest in something that you do not understand. And there is a lot to understand with something like Bitcoin.  
If someone asks: I have no idea what Bitcoin is, should I buy some of it? Then the answer is No. If they learn what it is, and then is still interested in buying and handling it, then they will not need to ask anyone else for advice anyways outside general financial planning, which is best suited for a professional.  
If someone is not experienced with investing or diversified saving and financial planning it is best that they start there anyways before they start to think about what they want to buy.

Wallets that are connected to the internet are never safer than the machine/connection that it is on. If you delete a wallet after having generated it there is still a chance that the seed-phrase or private keys have been stolen before you deleted it. If the wallet you download has been replaced by a fake-version the funds can be stolen even on an always-offline computer. There can be attacks even on the legitimate software, like when users got a fake upgrade notification on the real Electrum software that lead to users downloading a malware version that stole the Bitcoin.  
Wallets like Electrum on regular computers connected to the internet is intended for small amounts, for spending, it is not a good way to make a secure wallet. You can use the GPG-signature from the official site to verify that the software is legitimate.  
If you intend to put more than spending amounts of Bitcoin in a personal wallet you are best of buying a hardware wallet, that lets you generate the private key and transactions on a always-offline device which can be connected to a computer that lets you send if you like.  
To be able to retrieve Bitcoin in the future you need to make sure that you keep a physical copy of the seed and that nobody else gets to it.

~~They need to know how much you paid for the Bitcoin, so they can calculate the cost basis and capital gains effectively, if they don't know they risk having to pay capital gains on the whole Bitcoin amount instead of just the profits.~~ Edit: If step-up applies no need to know.
A hardware wallet plus a seed lets them access the Bitcoin and send it to an address without any prior knowledge since there is a how-to guide built into the product.
They need to know which exchange to register on, what the exchange address is and how to send to it, and preferably be cautioned to only transfer small amounts of Bitcoin to the exchange to sell and withdraw and do that many times over a longer span time.
If they are unfamiliar an uninterested in Bitcoin the best bet is to guide them to selling it without losing it to human mistakes or fraudulent exchanges. The goal is to make the Bitcoin into fiat with minimal risk.
You can create a dummy-wallet first with smaller amounts for them to test out first before entering the big savings.
My guess is that you will be best of creating a personal guide since most guides on Bitcoin is how to get started, how it works and what can be done with it, not so much how to get sell it safely.

After BCH increased the block limit to 32MB it was no longer possible to fill blocks, even if there was enough transactions, because data can not propagate through the network fast enough.  
They did manage a couple million transactions in a coordinated day, but that made the network slower and more unreliable when there was more transactions than it could handle.

Find some economic metric and translate it into the price of Bitcoin.  
If Bitcoin had the same market cap as Gold it would be around 420k per coin. Imagine that!  
If the net wealth of the world was in Bitcoin it would be 15 million per coin, wow!

Yes, the average annualized return in S&amp;P500 the last 90 years for holding is something like 3% per year over inflation.  
But if someone bought in right at the bottom of the great depression they would net 4% per year.  
The worst period was between 1968 and 1982, but anyone buying at 1982 and holding to now would have over 6% annualized returns.  
The market will in general give a higher return than interest on average over a long enough period of time.

The name is a reference to "green-eyed jealousy" google "color of jealousy" and the first thing that comes up is: " Dark green is associated with ambition, greed, and jealousy " it is also common to describe greed and finance in general. Green is associated with many things, but usually not generosity, which is why I think green generosity is fitting.  
First point about gold: I am bring up gold in Bitcoins defense, gold uses a lot of resources to be mined, somewhere around 100 billion per year in work that will never come back. The price of gold is roughly equal to the amount of material, labor, energy that will be used to mine it and currently about 100 Billion dollars is mined per year in Gold. As you point out there can be other environmental costs in addition. But the gold once mined does not require much energy to secure.  
For Bitcoin to maintain $1 000 000 it would require 657 Billion per year, or 1.8 Billion per day of money more of Bitcoin being bought than sold even if the energy used was clean. That is a lot of money spent to maintain the price of something, it is total overkill for what the network is used for currently, and unlike gold there is nothing that remains if Bitcoin mining stops in the future. More than the military spending of the US. But in 10 block halvings $1 000 000 works out to about 1.8 million per day without fees, which seems more reasonable.  
Norway (as an example) which has and sells a lot of hydroelectric power already made an exception for tax subsidies for crypto mining, they removed the subsidy for crypto specifically, every other energy intensive industry still gets the subsidy, but they did not want crypto miners. They say the reason is environmental, but I think the real reason is that they realize that there will not be much local labor or supporting industries, that they will get less in taxes than what they have to pay to subsidize.  
It is interesting that for the first time ever it is possible to have a sort of price floor for production of energy which does not require large infrastructure or materials, but even if the environmental impact of crypto was 0, the wealth creation of securing the network alone is also close to 0, it just needs enough security, not more.

Bitcoin is not guaranteed to increase in price over time.  
If the inflation rate of Bitcoin was high enough/increasing fast enough it would guarantee that the price of Bitcoin would go down over time.  
But the inflation rate going down and eventually stopping does not alone make it so that the price of Bitcoin goes up. If less people are interested in buying than selling Bitcoin over time the price will tend down, which can go on for a very long time, and Bitcoin can stop being a thing in the future for a number of reasons.

Yes.  
If you bought 1 Bitcoin for $100 and you sell 0.4 Bitcoin for $100 later you take the price you sold 0.4 Bitcoin minus the cost of that 0.4 Bitcoin.  
Cost of 0.4 Bitcoin would be $40, the sale is $100, you get taxed on the $60 profit.  
There is different taxrates on short-term and long-term holding.

The only way to look at fees is in a world currency.  
A few dollars is cheap for transactions that move thousands of dollars, and even hundred dollars is cheap when moving hundreds of thousands of dollars.

The latter obviously.  
That is true for any sort of project or company that succeeds, at a certain size it levels out because of the upper limits of the markets themselves.  
What was the probability that Amazon would grow a million times to become a trillion dollar company? Tiny! What is the chance that it grows a thousand times more to become a 1000 Trillion dollar company? Non-existent. At least when accounting for inflation. Because the whole net worth of everything in the world is in the hundreds of trillions.  
But if the likelihood of Bitcoin getting to 3.5k was extremely small, and it it ten times as likely to go to 1 million, it will still be extremely unlikely. It is like winning the superlottery and buying a ticket of the regular lottery because it is more likely than the previous victory.  
The probability that Bitcoin will be over/under the current price in the future is the real practical question and that is  toss-up.

Whitepaper is pretty good.  


  
Bitcoin being inflation free is the intention, it needs to eventually transition into being fully funded by fees.  
The fees need to be enough to secure the network. If (and only if) there is no enough fees in the future to secure the network with only fees, then the network can not transition entirely to fees. In that specific case, as  backup some tiny inflation could get introduced.  
Bitcoin was meant to be inflation free eventually, no doubt. And hopefully that happens.

I agree that hardware wallets are as good as it gets with crypto, the main challenge is keeping the seed secured, backed up on multiple physical locations and at the same time private while still being possible to recover in case of death. The most likely way to lose the funds in the hardware wallet is losing/misplacing the seed or it being damaged by moisture or the ink being ineligible. Things like crypto-steel, metal letter stamping, or even just lamination in the case of water helps. In that sense the seed is similar to how bearer bonds is secured.  
Ironically the best place to do an underground Cash for Bitcoin transaction would likely be inside the police station. Unless of course it is the sort of Police station where the Police is in hoots with the "buyers". The Achilles heel for anyone that sketchy people knows have crypto off the grid is the $5 wrench attack.  
The one thing that Crypto offers that nothing else does is censorship resistant transfers and the ability to temporarily store it in the head when crossing borders fleeing, and as you say, the likely ability to sell/spend it almost anywhere.  
People interested in putting some of their savings in crypto should (ideally): Get a hardware wallet, generate the seed, write down the first address, reset the hardware wallet, restore the hardware wallet using the seed, check/verify the first address, add some passphrase, write it down and check it, keep the seed and passphrase stored at different locations and have backups for both of them that do not get destroyed by the elements or wear, preferably in temper-proof envelopes or something similar. Keep the crypto/amounts private.  
Once that is done it is smooth sailing for anyone who wants to put some of their saving into their personal cold storage.  
A solution which is probably good enough for most people is a hardware wallet and storing the seed where nobody will think to ever look (the underwear draw). There is never a 100% and that is probably in the 98% safe per year range.  
I am not saying that people SHOULD put their crypto on exchanges, hot wallets or web wallets, just that it is what the majority of people will do out of convenience and habit because we are humans. That the % of people who properly secure their crypto with contingencies in case of death is a very small.

If you want anything resembling anonymity you need to move it through privacy coin(s) or tumblers or large custodial wallet(s) or some combination, but each step introduces some risk and has some cost. If you manage to get anonymous Bitcoin and then use bitcoin with enough people/groups that is unmasked you can indirectly be unmasked as well, and if you ever mix your anonymous Bitcoin in with Bitcoin that is tied to your ID you are back to square one. You can have anonymous Bitcoin and still get it tied to you by using services that has your name tied to some address as well.  
If you move your Bitcoin various services to make Bitcoin not traceable back to you it is best to not deposit it back to Coinbase, as the coins you got most likely has a colorful and non-coinbase friendly history.  
The easiest way to transact with some privacy from Coinbase is to buy Zcash, move it to a public address, then to a shielded address, then convert it gradually back to Bitcoin over some decentralized exchange or exchange without registration.  
If you just want to transact without making a permanent record you can also jump on the LN. The fact that you open and close a channel will be recorded, but what happens on the LN is not recorded in the blockchain itself, only the final balance and time when returning on-chain.

There is no need to debunk **any one** method because there is **no method** that works.  
Not consistently, not over time, not significantly better than chance, not without certain conditions in place. The more aggressive a method is, the more potential return but the same or more increase in risk.  
It is impossible to lose in a putting money on a repeated coinflip game as long as you know that the coin will only land heads 5 times in a row, just double your bet every loss.  
But even buying/selling on random chance, flipping a buy/sell coin every day, will outperform all other methods.  
Since there is costs associated with actively buying/selling, spread/fees, and risk associated with exchanges, it is on average best to not try to time the market actively with buying and selling short term.  
But I will contradict myself a bit by saying that it is actually possible to make money on trading Bitcoin consistently, by having insider information or being able to move the market, but that is none of us. There is also certain movements that comes from mass psychology, but more likely than not people get caught up in those instead of benefiting personally from them. That is not specific to Bitcoin though.  
If there was such a thing that a method that actually worked (consistently, without conditions), then the person knowing it would not share it. Some pretend to have a magic method that they will sell for a large amount of money to offset their losses by sharing it, but this is just a way to trick others and take their money. It is the oldest trick in the book to find some exploit, make money of it, then sell the method when it no longer turns a profit to milk it.

If the block reward was increased 1000x, 12 500 Bitcoin per blocks, adding a very high inflation, there would be an extreme selling pressure on Bitcoin, that would guarantee that the price of Bitcoin would go down.  
And the same if the inflation doubles every 4 years or something like that, people will sell their coins because they know that the price is guaranteed to go down, so even before the inflation increases, if people know that inflation will increase in the future they will start selling right away.  
That is part of the reason why there can be high inflation even though there is little or no new money printed, because everyone tries to spend and get rid of their money as soon as they get it.

That was because the price of Bitcoin shot up way faster than the production and installation of mining machines, it was a very lucrative time to mine. More and more miners was added, then the profitability went down, eventually as the price goes down only the most cost effective (electricty, labor, machines) miners is able to mine.  
After a price boom there will be more miners going up every day, and it will keep increasing in the months/year afterward even if the price goes down. But after the price keeps going down then more and more miners will be pressed out of the market.  
Newer machines are improving in energy efficient and speed as well, they are also sold cheaper due to lower demand, so the hashrate will keep on climbing over time even if the price is not going up.  
That is the reason the Hashrate is 50 000 times larger now than in the ATH in 2013, is mostly because of new machines, faster and more energy efficient.  
Energy use will over time tend towards the price, [

Also possible to make gold on earth by using enough energy, not cost effective, and potentially radioactive.  
If the cost of getting 1 ounce of gold to earth from an asteroid is $10,000 there will be no increase in the gold supply of earth from that asteroid until the price goes and stays over that threshold.  
The last 100+ years has had a pretty steady increase of the total tonnes mined every year, from 500 tonnes yearly in 1900 to 2500+ now. In that sense it is the opposite of Bitcoins controlled supply.

The main issue, even if consumers do not want to use on-chain transactions directly for purchases, is that people need to be able to save directly on-chain if they want to not rely on other centralized services.  
As long as the fees are small enough that it is possible to incrementally put Bitcoin into and out of cold storage over time it will not stop that from happening. But if the chain security comes from something like a sustained $10 per transaction or more fee it will lock out that sort of personal storage.  
Fees does not need to be almost free, they just need to be cheap enough for whatever its usecase is.  
People being able to put money into and out of Bitcoin on-chain is necessary for it to not become a token in central banks, exchanges and applications. Where the fees hit a level where that becomes cost prohibitively can be argued, but the higher the fees gets over cheap enough, the more people will be locked out from that.

Full nodes is not more secure than the computer that it is running on though, same with SPV wallets, it is a hot wallet that should ideally only have spending bits. For security there is nothing better than cold storage and hardware wallets offer a good bridge between hot and cold. Using a full node or SPV on a personal computer mostly comes down to personal preference. SPV wallets works great as an alternative for mobile and custodial wallets on smaller devices.

There is no need to send hitmen out for sketchy exchanges, they can profit directly by just selling the information of users including their personal information to the highest bidder.

I would not say that the energy/material consumption of Bitcoin is a feature, more a necessary evil. The mining reward is roughly equal to the wealth spent mining, the difference of gold mining for example is that it is mostly electricity.  
The reason that there has been some mining in very poor countries is mostly a result of price fixing for electricity like in Venezuela. The cheapest electricity prices for the miners will always be the subsidized prices like the special rate for high-energy industry that the state can grant, but that mostly happens to attract industry that gives a lot of labor for the locals. The subsidized electricity prices will be lower than the actual cost of production of electricity anywhere in the world.  
But even in the case of practically free energy, energy that is produced that can not be sold or stored for later, even then it depends on the prices they can get the mining hardware for, and if they are geographically challenged and unable to sell their surplus electricity directly, then the likelihood of getting machines at a price that gives a ROI before depreciation is still low.
  
Without the needs for machines to mine, and not looking at price fixing and subsidies, in the case of converting excess energy directly to Bitcoin, then it would be possible for any place to sell energy at some price at a guaranteed return.

That works in case the demand is very inelastic but it is not a long term solution as the fees will tend towards the old price equilibrium and there is only so many times the block can be reduced in size.

I see the fact that Bitcoin can and will be lost forever as a liability more than an plus. It is currently a plus for anyone not losing their keys that others do, especially large holders, but it is not good overall.  
It is mostly an side-effect of people controlling their private keys.  
In the case of Bitcoin becoming more like a world reserve it would be managed through centralized institutions and people would have legal IOUs, not private keys.  
The cost of transacting is setting up contracts, not the money moving through the banks themselves. I think you mentioned earlier that it is more effective to have a record of debts than to transact the money directly, that is how the world mostly operates now, contracts and debts all the way down.

**If** everyone in the world did everything on Bitcoin I agree with you that on-chain transactions is not possible or plausible.  
I just view Bitcoin as a niche thing for people who want to personally control their private keys and transact directly, which I assume is a market that consists of a small percentage of the worlds population that fall outside of where the conventional markets and traditional banking is better suited. The price itself is almost pure price speculation, not investment based on underlying economic activity or some imagined scarcity.  
The argument can be made that there are other cryptos that is better suited for that niche and that Bitcoin going down the road of centralized services and custodial wallets may be what it is best suited for.  
I get the argument that if Bitcoin remains 1MB and on-chain transactions average $1000 in fees it will mean that there is an enormous level of activity per transaction that justifies it, that it implies that Bitcoin has become the world reserve. Not that it is desirable in itself, but that it is a symptom of a desirable situation. At 500 000 on-chain transactions per day it implies close to 0.5 Billion in energy usage every day, but that is another thing entirely.  
I just do not see  hyperbitcoinization happen (descriptive) and in addition i would not prescribe it as I do not think that the costs outweighs the benefits, at least I have not seen any evidence for it, and whatever the best solution is on any level of the pencil being made, the likelihood that it will be related to Bitcoin specifically is very small.

That is definitely true, there in total more choices now.  
When given the choice I think that almost everyone will tend towards the most convenient solution that has the least amount of personal responsibility. My guess is that those who use Bitcoin for saving will tend towards cold storage as exchanges and hot wallets is no good over the long run, while most people have custodial wallets that might also allow for direct buying.  
The flipside is that if enough people move into custodial wallets and larger systems, there can be a situation where the on-chain transactions become cost prohibitive to use but for the largest sort of transaction. A large enough LN with enough custodial wallets that move large amounts in/out of on-chain could over time make on-chain storage less feasible for smaller amounts.  
Ultimately Bitcoin has to cater to what people want, not the other way around, but time will show what those wants and needs will be.

There is a difference between the market and cryptocurrency in that the market is positive-sum, everyone over a long enough period can make a positive return by investing and later selling. The average return per person is positive long term with a certain percent annualized.  
The price of crypto is based almost exclusively on price speculation, so money changing hands in anticipation of future price changes. There is no theoretical way that the average gains would be larger than the average losses, it is possible for any one person to win or lose in crypto because the gains/losses are not equally distributed.  
It is true that it is not possible to look at the past performance of the economy and say that it will go on in the future, but it is the best bet we have, and if the economy as whole (the whole system) tanks, Bitcoin will not be a safe haven.

They generally withdraw from that address to some sort of exchange where they sell it or then send it to their personal wallet/cold storage.  
But even in donations it is generally best practice to get a newly generated address, institutions sometimes lets users generate new addresses to donate, an example is the donation page on wikileaks.  
It is easier for a person to just have a single donation address, and that is the reason they have one. One downside of having a single donation address is that everyone can see how much that person has received, even if they never actually use/spend from that address.  
But that is also the reason why someone have one single address, if they want to show the world exactly how much they have gotten, the size and time of each transaction.  
Wallets often have "Coin selection" which lets users spend from or lock spending from individual addresses to prevent addresses to be linked together in a shared transaction, but it is important to remember that transactions on the blockchain that is tied to a exchange is not private no matter how many precautions that a person takes unless they use good mixing services or move crypto into (For now) untraceable coins like Zcash or Monero and back into Bitcoin. But the more people have their identity tied to their wallets, the easier it is to figure out who everyone else is, so that is the reason that it is good to take some privacy precautions.

Part of the mechanism for controlling is controlling the money supply using interest, QE and public spending. FIAT has only been in full force since 1971, it is still way to early to say if it actually can work long term.  
The question is if targeting inflation will postpone and worsen the condition that the expansionary monetary policy set out to fix.  
The problem is that whatever works within 4 years that will worsen things in 40 years will always be preferable politically an socially.

The controversial Avalanche addition in Bitcoin Cash hardcodes the probabilistic element away from it some blocks in the past.  
Granted there is no 100% anyways in the case of an outside shock that fries electronic data. And in the case of law there is always the possibility of something being inadmissible even though it is provable for reasons of incompetence or political will. And even then there can be changes to the code in the future that archives or prunes previous transactions from the main history where archival nodes becomes more like traditional archives. And that does not address the fact that the documents/data itself that is notarized can be fraudulent and the keys used can be lost.  
But I agree that the highest POW coin will all other things being equal be the best for notarization. It is just that it is not notarization and data validation itself that is the main value proposition of Bitcoin, it is just an side effect of it.  
The only thing that makes a coin the highest POW coin is the amount of money that people puts into it relative to its supply inflation (block reward) plus the fees people pay for transactions. Which hinges on people buying and holding it in hopes that others will do the same as an economy of commerce related to Bitcoin happens.  
If Bitcoin fails to gain traction in commerce it will not be suited for notarization and data validation either as the price will fall, the block rewards keeps halving, people will not pay for transactions which reduces the POW until purpose built ledgers is able to win in both design and POW.  
I also think that there are usecases for Blockchain or Crypto that is outside of direct payments, but that whatever Bitcoin can do in those areas purpose built tech can do way better. Bitcoin currently is at capacity on-chain and does not aim to increase that on-chain capacity, moving over to LN, which may have some use-cases other than regular commercial payments.  
This is also one of the splits in BCH and BSV as Bitcoin SV is opening up for more file storage and databases while BCH is focusing more exclusively on financial transactions. Bitcoin being permissionless makes it so that anyone can do anything that is possible of course.  
**TLDR:** There are things that are more interesting that buying coffee, but those things are only enable as a side-effect of people actually being able to buy, hold and than later spend their Bitcoin on boring Coffee.

That is the alternative, maybe something other than POW and POS all together, God knows what will happen.  
But in case of 0 block reward, and low total fees (to low for POW security), then there may be some discussion about scrapping POW or keeping POW and introducing some inflation. But that is close to 100 years into the future.

What do you mean by HODL threshold? The point where we reach the previous ATH level again?  
I would be very surprised if Bitcoin goes to 20k before the end of next year but time will show, who knows if there will be a new ATH. But for anyone who thinks that there is a new ATH coming the next decade it makes sense (for them) to just sit on their BTC if they can afford it.

You mentioned 3% yearly inflation, did you mean 3% increase in bitcoins purchasing power over 200 years? A 3% yearly deflation.  
If Bitcoins purchasing power, inflation-adjusted-price increases 3% every year for 200 years it will reach a million dollars in todays purchasing power, yes.  
But by that time that sort of purchasing power may not be particularly impressive as the economy and per-capita income grows as a whole. Inflation adjusted income is about 20 times larger than it was 200 years ago in the US.

I agree that there has always been a high cost to running the Bitcoin network paid with inflation and that the only way to move from inflation and keep the POW security is to move towards fee.  
The only question is the balance between average fee cost per transaction and the number of transactions.  
If $100 000 is enough to secure the network for most uses it can be done with 100 000 $1 transactions or 10 000 000 $0.01 transactions per day.  
Alternative some small inflation has to be maintained like any crypto with a tail emission, however small that is.

A side effect of removing income/payroll and corporate tax is that it becomes cheaper to actually pay the citizens of the country that they move to and operate in, it is a social/economic win, which is partly why the Scandinavian countries has a relatively high VAT tax (also high income tax). But the trend there seems to be moving towards more, not less, VAT and less corporate tax.
It will be interesting to see if people in high inflation countries are willing and able to put savings into Bitcoin AND personally control the private keys.
Having an offline generated wallet on a non-compromised computer with a secured seed/Passphrase that is private that long term savings is a high ask for people.
I could see people in various high-inflation without citizen access to international markets put a portion of their savings into crypto, but I think that it will for the most part be on exchanges and web wallets where the likelihood of it being stolen or lost is high.
My personal guess for another Crypto (price) boom comes from traditional pension saving giving the option to have a % in crypto where they track the crypto index without people directly handling their crypto.
The mining process (paid in Bitcoin/Gold) and finite/fixed upper limit mimics Gold, but that is where the analogy to gold stops. Bitcoin offered a (sufficient) solution to the double spend problem but remained agnostic towards what people used it for as it is permissionless and censorship resistant. No intermediaries is the key. People saving and transacting in Bitcoin is both necessary of time to get price stability and to move towards the POW being paid by fees.

People in developed countries are generally able to store their wealth in all sorts of alternative investments that are not tied to the local economy, global funds and gold for example.

It is great for retailers to accept it or in cases of donations and gifts as well as they can not have the transaction disputed.  
But I agree that as a user it is way safer to use credit cards if given the option solely because of the fraud protection and reversibility in case of a dispute.  
If users only use it in cases where a user fears the transaction being censored or reversed it makes it so that only illegal markets operate with Bitcoin and it will be dead in the water for public acceptance or growth. Even to hold Bitcoin for price speculation would be tantamount to long the illegal markets.  
It is possible to use Bitcoin as a service for timestamped notarization/data storage/proof of existence, but that is a feature that is native to any public immutable ledger and it is not the main value proposition of Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin lives and dies on its ability to facilitate financial transactions that people control directly. But I concede that there is no non-ideologically motivated reason to actually buy and use Bitcoin for that reason, as it incurs some costs compared to the easier and safer alternatives (CC).

A 0.1% yearly inflation would double the supply in every 700 years, and a 0.01% (if that was sufficient) would do the same over 7000 years. It is possible to make the case that any inflation, however small would eventually be moved up because of the interest of those who earn from it is larger than the losses from those who lose from it, but that is a political case.  
It is also possible to do tail emissions that itself slowly grow over time but does not have a compounding effect like a percentage based inflation. Or it could be an emission that looked more like a natural logarithm over time where it grows, but the rate which it grows is slower over time. The total supply of Bitcoin itself could be modeled to fit as well.  
The options is not either compounding towards infinity or tending towards zero when it comes to block rewards in the case that fees is not enough.  
But if Inflation is not possible, then the fees has to be enough, and that is a tradeoff between fewer more expensive and more less expensive. That is the main difference in views. Inflation is for the most part seen as undesirable as it is a cost that is imposed on everyone.

He is right about the price of Bitcoin being in large part the result of people not knowing what they are buying or why they are buying it. Or people who know what Bitcoin is that is buying and selling based on price speculation alone.  
The value of Bitcoin comes from what the users in aggregate can use it for which is better for them than the alternatives.  
The price however is mostly a result of people that is making a bet about the expectation of what others will buy/sell, not reflecting anything that Bitcoin itself does.

As soon as there is an economic incentive in place it distorts whatever data that they try to capture, they already have a hard time getting the bots who are active off the site and there is a constant arms-race between the bots/sites which would be way worse if they were paid to be active on the site.  
It would require that the people signing up could do some KYC verification with copies of their passport/ID and it would also mean that it is another revenue stream for those who have stolen personal information from others by having bots run on supposedly real accounts that get paid. There would also be no way to do any sort of fraud protection if someone did use the ID of someone else, because the transactions are non-reversible.  
Lastly there may not actually be a legally binding requirement for them to sell the information of all the users anyways, not any information that could not otherwise be legally sold, and the TOS would at any case be subject to change at any time, so the site would have no paying out sign ups other than a false sense of security.  
Advertisers do not want users that is hanging on the site or clicking on ads to earn money, because it defeats and distorts the purpose of advertisements, they would much rather pay for tweets that got promoted and seemed more organic.  
It was not uncommon to see "Watch ads for Bitcoin" sites in the past where some percent of the revenue from the ads were given, but they were technically against the TOS of google analytics because it is basically abusing the intended effect of ads and opening up for automated spamming that cost advertisers, which is why any such site today is giving out the sorts of ads that is blacklisted from the rest of the web and the site will most likely try to sneak in whatever they can on the users computer. An "Get crypto to stay on Twitter with real ID confirmed" will likely run into the same sort of problem, but even if it did not, the payouts per hour of using the site from ads legitimately is likely in the cents or fractions of it.  
It would sour the experience of the user and twitter alike.  
Legally there is a whole host of issues that comes up when there are direct payments to users in real assets. What reddit and Twitch does is way safer and easier, people can use money to buy points or "bits" or coins that is used for cosmetics and which can purchase stuff on the platform. There was originally a plan to have a reddit crypto in 2014 or about then, but it was scrapped.  
Almost all of twitters revenue (which is not profitable compared to its costs) is from users paying to promote tweets.  
Minds, a Twitter Competitor is trying to launch a Crypto in the platform to reward activity, time will show how it plays out.  
I personally prefer to pay for services if possible, but I am naive in thinking that that does not mean that my personal information does not get sold anyways, unless they are not able to.

The inflation number talks about some prices averaging around X% increased, but as you say, there is a lot of room for arbitrary decisions in that process, but it gives a rough estimate. You are right that consumers will adjust their spending and if the categories are not managed properly it can become extremely misleading.  
But even if the measurement of inflation was perfect it does not change the fact that the inflation number that they target is pretty arbitrary and time will show if it was a good idea.  
There will not be a one-to-one relationship between money supply and inflation, even with the same consumer preferences and production methods because of things like demographic chances.

I would not tout this horn to loudly as it is possible to encode it into Bitcoin as well.  
It is possible to encode 50kb files directly into the UTOX set directly already which is way harder to prune away than any OPcode.  
The other implication is that the fact that this material can be encoded into the full nodes can set up a precedent to it being illegal for regular people to run it. Already in 2013 there were illegal material written to Bitcoin opcode and that was at the time an argument for nodes being illegal. Part of the argument at the time was that it was the sort of data that was possible to prune away being an opcode.  
The only thing the news and chatter around illegal data written to the blockchain, it is free advertisement for something that has in principle and practice been a side effect of Bitcoin since the start.

The FIAT experiment has been running internationally since 1971 and time will show to which degree it is postponing the issues it was supposed to fix.  
I just personally do not see the advantages that Bitcoin has over Gold in that scenario, since there would need to be mediated through the world governments, institutions and be backed up by the underlying economic and military might of the various nations and alliances.  
If Bitcoin naturally became something like a decentralized Gold of a large enough size it would (I think) either be bent to the will of the most powerful or just closed down with laws and regulation.  
I lean towards the usecase of crypto being in small areas where regular currency and banking is not suitable for now, and for those who want to control their private keys.

The total amount of Gold in tonnes that has been mined per decade the last 100 years has been on a pretty upwards trajectory, over four times more gold mined per year now than in beginning of 1900s, and almost all gold has been mined the last 200 years, so its supply increase has so far been the opposite of Bitcoin.  
Both Gold and Bitcoin will over time be disinflationary in the sense that the increase in the supply per year increasing will be lower in total numbers and percent. The amount of gold on earth is for all intents and purposes fixed, it will just be mined over an extremely long time and slower over time.  
The main difference in Bitcoin and Gold in mining is not the amounts being fixed, or that a higher price makes more work for them happen, but that with gold an increased price leads (over a couple years) to a higher rate of mining, a slightly higher supply inflation, while with Bitcoin the inflation rate it predetermined and more work will not mine Bitcoin faster.  
There has been many of completely finite things that has a market price in the world, Bitcoin is the first digital one that can be exchanged. It is not the first crypto that has currently 0% inflation and a fixed upper cap though, and the number of those cryptos that can be created is not limited.  
Inflation can (does not need to) be added in the far future, long after we are dead, for reasons we do not foresee. You could say that at that time it is no longer Bitcoin, and that there will always be a fork that preserves the limit, and that will be Bitcoin.

There is no reason to worry about that. What is most important in your stage is to increase your skills, experience and earnings potential and to build good relationships and form life experiences.  
If you want to play around with Bitcoin you can buy a very small amount every month and live life like you otherwise would. There is no way that the price changes in Bitcoin will make or break your future at this point.  
But before you buy bitcoin you need to earn more than you spend, preferably save up an emergency fund and some months of emergency cash. Then you can use something like 5% of what you save every month on Bitcoin.  
The only way that you will miss out out of any wild Bitcoin ups/downs if you buy more Bitcoin without having a stable income and costs under control and you end up having to sell it.  
Just be aware that the probability that it all comes tumbling down is always there and that the 2017 price hike may have been the last of its kind.

You are still affected by taxation on the nominal difference of your investment.  
If you invest 100, which nominally turns to 300 because of inflation, you will have to pay capital gains taxes for 200 when you sell it, even if you actually did not get an increase in purchasing power. If you get a 30% inflation adjusted return you still may just break even depending on the inflation and tax rate.  
Worst case scenario is high capital gains tax combined with high inflation.  
The periods of high inflation has also been the periods with low returns in the market, like the high inflation and decades long decrease in the stock market from the mid 60s to the mid 80s.  
At the very least it takes time for the tax brackets for income to be adjusted, so everyone gets an effectively higher tax on their income in addition to getting their capital gains and interest taxed even at a real loss.

It would be good news if it teleported to earth in the sense of reducing costs of various metals, a lot of money would be needed to be printed to avoid deflation from the price of goods decreasing.

To have and use Bitcoin in most developed countries requires by law that any holder/user report their holdings, all transactions and any realized capital gains/losses ever tax year. Anything else is tax evasion and/or neglect.  
The more people are using Bitcoin as a way to hide taxable income or wealth, the more legal and cultural barriers there will be in place to actually being able to buy/sell and spend Crypto.  
The general advice to never say anyone that you have or how much you have of crypto because anyone can force you to disclose the key as long as they can access you.  
The edge case you are describing is a failing or corrupt state where crypto can be used as a way to take capital out of a country when physically fleeing yourself. It is a nice option to have on the table for those in that situation but it is increasingly irrelevant to the price at the current market price.  
In 2013 it did have some impact when the Cyprus banks directly confiscated money from the savings accounts and they bought Bitcoin as an non-state solution, but the same thing happening today would not have the same impact as the market is way bigger.

Being in the top 1% of wealth in the world requires something like 770k USD, which is more than most people in the US even with more than median full-time income can hope for.  
As you say, gross income does not take living expenses like student loans or healthcare costs into account, and those are often very high in the US compared to other parts of the world where education and healthcare is state sponsored to a larger degree. What people want is financial security which is something a lot of US citizens do not have currently.

The wallet you have uses the seed (keep a copy of it on paper, and no digital copies of it) to make a lot of addresses.  
Every time you receive on one address the wallet will give you a new address that you can receive on, but they are generated from the seed so it is still the same wallet.  
The reason for this is partly to preserve some privacy for yourself and those who transact with you. You can still give out the old address and get payments on it, but it is generally discouraged to reuse addresses as it makes unmasking users easier.  
When you spend/send Bitcoin from your wallet the wallet will automatically select the addresses that in total has enough for the transfer and return the change amount to a new address (change address).  
Once an address has received then later spent an amount, it stops being relevant, since the whole transaction history is stored in the blockchain the transactions to/from the address will be stored, but the address itself will not be used for anything.  
Only addresses that actually have a history of receiving Bitcoin will enter the history, if you just create a wallet, never put any bitcoin on it, then delete it, then none of the addresses will show up anywhere.  
An address can be thought of as a wallet, but the sort of wallet you have on the phone is a collection of addresses that is made from the seed. The addresses that has some bitcoin in them currently is generally what is called single wallets, so you could say that you have a mobile wallets with a lot of wallets in it if you have a lot of transactions going into it in different addresses.

The transaction costs/market fees and realized taxation that happens from active buying/selling in volatile markets generally makes it less profitable over the long term than simple dollar cost averaging.  
It also depends on the local laws where you live, in general the best bet is to save a fixed amount every month in some sort of index fund that tracks a local/global index. A possible tweak is to put in some % more in case of a larger price drop in an index and then some less if there is a sudden increase, but otherwise save a little every month.  
There are a lot of people who will show models of fantastic returns by running numbers on previous prices and the decisions that they would have made, but always after it happens. In general there is not possible to consistently outperform the market by timing volatility. The exception is those who are in a position to have an effect on it themselves.  
There are people wanting sell you their opinions and products, but the best you can do is looking up what you are interested in on neutral sources that just explain it.

The majority of the 1000x gains were those who came across Bitcoin at some time by happenstance and forgot about it, but then later recovered it way later when it got big and sold it. Those who were more active with their Bitcoin has had a good chance of losing it by human/machine error, a certain famous exchange or simply just selling or spending it as price changed gradually or in short bursts. Even if they kept it all it is more likely that they acquired more and more Bitcoin as the price went up so the total average return was more modest. The sort of people who bought a lot of Bitcoin for investing purposes and secured it without fail is a very tiny group which has a very small percent of the total Bitcoin in circulation.  
The opposite is also true, if there ever comes a time where almost everyone thinks that it will be possible and probable to get a 10x-100x return with Bitcoin, and that is the reason that people is buying in mass, then that will most likely result in people ending up losing 90-99% of what they put in as the steam runs out. Whatever the majority of people expect will always be the opposite of what will play out in price speculation long term.

People do not pay taxes on their holdings, only realized capital gains.  
People do not increase their wealth by charitable donations, they get a reduction in their income equivalent to what they gave away.  
If the PinappleFund gave Bitcoin directly in the US it just means that neither the fund, nor the recipients pay the capital gains tax, but it does not reduce the income tax of the giver.  
Everyone who pays taxes can use the "income tax strategy" of giving to charity and deduct that from their income. Just means that instead of giving $100 and paying $30 in tax the person only gives away $100 of their own money (if they pay 30% marginal tax).

Bitcoins main strength in use is censorship resistance, so when payment processors blocked wikileaks some years ago supporters sent Bitcoin instead. Technically virtually all crypto is censorship resistant, but Bitcoin is the biggest and most widely accepted.
Currently the price of Bitcoin is almost exclusively set by price speculation where people take bets on others taking bets on the price. Which is part of the reason the price is so volatile and prone to price bubbles.
If there was no price speculation the price of Bitcoin would come from its use alone, which currently is getting around sanctions and censorship.

Being a sheep is generally a good strategy, what most people do is for the most part the best bet. The only improvement is finding the best interest accounts if you have cash that you save over long periods.  
The only nit-pick is that the bank is renting your money, not giving you interest for free, there is income tax on the interest and inflation is generally higher than the interest. The bank does give free every-other-service which is great though. That is what banks are great for.  
You can compare the interest to the rate you can get from renting your money in the market.  
[  
There may be savings programs with your government which gives extra interest or the possibility to deduct from taxes under certain conditions to incentive stuff like saving for an apartment.  
The only scenario it is no point in putting money into interest based accounts is for saving for a pension that is far in the future where money in the market will outperform over time.

I knew a guy who was absolutely certain in the late 90s when the first commercially viable mobile phones came that it was the next big thing. Not the portable phone/calling itself, but that it would be tided to the ID of the person, payment, banking, camera, internet and even social networking.  
That did not help him one bit in figuring out which company or project to put his money behind in hopes of capitalizing on that foresight. It was still a crap shoot to capitalize on the prediction.  
However he did love to tell people about his estimation, and most everyone was dismissive of it at the time. So the "prize" after it all was that he is gloating about being one of the few at the time that saw it coming the way that it did.

The issue I have with that is that Coinbase and services like it can and will close the accounts of anyone that sends crypto to any place that is not allowed by the US government like gambling or anything that infringes on Copyright like piracy sites. It is also the case that Coinbase has the identity and activity and they can be legally required to deliver that to the state.  
Other services that want to work with Coinbase will likely have to follow the same rules.  
It is also the case that Coinbase can over time go under like all other companies, and even if they do not accounts that get hacked or compromised will lose their crypto without any insurance like there is for the USD holdings in the bank (and Coinbase).  
And even if they do not go under there can be changes to the laws in the US that they will have to follow, like locking out users from certain countries or set restrictions for all.  
For regular users it will in any case be way easier to operate for companies and induvidals with the USDC if they are not going to control the private keys directly.  
Counter Point:  
It is possible that Crypto for regular people becomes like the the current online banking, same laws and regulations, and there is a smaller section of people who control their own keys.

The last price boom from gold was from 2000 to 2011, and during that period the inflation adjusted increase from the lowest to the highest was a 5.4x increase gradually over 11 years. The price is about 65% of its $2000 top in 2011.  
Gold is mostly about preserving wealth in times of perceived turbulence and uncertainty, unless someone is doing short term leveraged speculation on it.

5% average annualized real returns after inflation and taxation is definitely feasible by dollar cost averaging over decades unless there is a shock to the local/global economy. But to do that there needs to be a short term risk over many years, it is not possible to have a guaranteed real return in the short term in the form of interest over inflation after taxation anywhere close to 5% per year. Interest on savings is rarely more than a couple percent over inflation and taxes has to be paid on both the interest and the inflation.  
The last 9 years has been exceptionally good for having money in the stock market, but adjusted for inflation the last 20 years for the S&amp;P500 has had an annualized real return of 1.8% before taxes for whatever was bought 20 years ago. 30 years ago is closer to 5%.  
For anyone saving up over a couple of years it is generally best to not have price swings, same reason it is best to prioritize paying down debt before investing.

The price of any stable store of value, which Gold is the standard, will go up compared to USD over time because the US uses fiat and the monetary policy targets inflation. (Since 1971) (EDIT: US currency became FIAT in 1917)
The US gold standard had already been abandoned locally in 1933, but the international agreement to have a fixed Gold/USD rate for foreign holders of USD was abolished in 1971.
It had been illegal for regular people in the US to own or trade gold since the gold standard was abolished locally, but in 1975 that opened up.
So at the very start of the removal of the international agreement the price (for foreign holders of USD) was no longer pegged to a fixed $35, there was no way for Gold to go but up right afterwards compared to USD, even not taking inflation into account. The 70s and beginning of 1980s had a lot of inflation for various reasons, some which was influenced by monetary policy.
But inflation adjusted Gold has never been above what it spiked up to in 1980 in inflation adjusted dollars, it goes up and down over decades (inflation adjusted) but does not trend upwards like the market overall.

As long as there is some mempool the transactions is running at max capacity.
100% segwit/bech32 adoption for regular transactions translates to around 2MB equivalent blocks.  
The fees is the only variable and they will reach the price equilibrium where enough users delay or stop their transactions. That is a bidding auction that will always happen until the price goes up so far that enough people start to stop bidding at that price.  
The transaction volume can go up 4x, if demand goes up 16x, and the average transaction has a net gain of $100 for the person doing the transaction, the same pattern will come again.  
It is not a feature of the capacity, but the capacity in relation the demand, demand outgrowing capacity will turn into a bidding situation.

They can only make a killing if someone is losing the same sort of killing on the other end.  
If Bitcoin funds (or % Bitcoin funds) becomes widespread in pension funds it could lead to an enormous upwards pressure on the price over time, up to a point, and then it will all come tumbling down as the pension funds are sold/spent in the future. And that process can go on for a very long time, there is no option for pensioners in general to "Keep on holding" when they are living of their Bitcoin pensions.  
But it would mean that the price of Bitcoin would have even less with people having Bitcoin in the sense of controlling the private keys.  
The flipside is that if the funds actively adjusts the % that is allocated in them, i.e selling Bitcoin actively as long as the price is going up, and buying it actively s the price goes down, it could in theory be a mechanism to slow down any potential future price hype cycle.  
But that is unlikely compared with the alternative which is an increasing amount of pure Bitcoin funds or funds that increase their % as prices keeps climbing. It looks to me to be a new large wealth transfer.

Correct me if I am wrong, was not familiar with rebatable fees in Bitcoin.  
Is the gist that an special fee in addition to the estimated fee to get in the next block can be paid to get the fastest possible guaranteed transfer. Then that special fee instead of getting sent fully into the next block gets added to a reward pool which is averaged out over a larger number of blocks into the future?  
Bitcoin has disinflation until it reaches 0 inflation by design, there will only ever be a necessity for inflation if it is necessary to secure the network once there is (close) to 0 block reward in the far future unless there is a way to secure the network without POW.  
There most likely (IMO) will be a "21 million club" for as long as Bitcoin lives. At least for as long as most of us are alive.

A possible scenario is that the internet goes down and the electronic infrastructure gets wiped out without it ending the US nation state.  
Another is if the encryption is broken or there is some sort of critical flaw that is not foreseen and not stopped in time which makes Bitcoin not possible to salvage.  
There is of course also a most likely that Bitcoin never reaches 1 Million adjusted for inflation without a catastrophe or bitcoin failure, I would wager that it is more likely that Bitcoin will fade to obscurity to the point where it no longer have an active market for buying/selling/transacting even if it is maintained for historical interest. Bitcoin becoming inactive could be the metaphorical 0.  
I may think that the probability of Bitcoin going to 0 is one in a billion, but it is still (in my guesswork) less likely that it will ever maintain above 1 million in price per bitcoin adjusted for inflation with the majority of coins in circulation. Say one in two billion chance of that happening.

Not to mention that the largest risk with using any sort of brainwallet that is actually as secure as a standard seed is the extremely high probability of forgetting it in part or whole.

The article mixes up the personal and collective benefit and making the claim that since other investments is propped up by fiat, so it in a sense it is fiat, but that Bitcoin itself is an exception without making the case for why.  
To the degree that the economy itself is built upon a mirage, so is Bitcoin.  
If something is going to be the next big thing, then it is smart to put money into that thing is the point which is made, but there is no argument for why that next big thing will be Bitcoin.

They can still do civil forfeiture, but they can not confiscate the property of the person outside of what was part of the crime, the fine or punishment in the case of a charge and conviction.  
It is a step in the right direction, but it is still possible to do civil asset forfeiture without any charges or convictions, just taking the money directly without charging anyone.

The state does not give restitution from theft and hacks though, that is what insurance is for. It can only punish the criminals that get caught and proved.  
If one person steals from another, whatever it is, it is possible to press charges, and if there is evidence that holds up in court there can be a settlement.  
But outside of that it is possible to get a theft/loss registered as a realized capital loss, or at least it should be, which would give you (I think) 25% of the cost basis back up to 3k per year.

He thinks that the price of Bitcoin will go up long term, and it will not stop going up long term, that is what PermaBull implies. He thinks the price will go up because Bitcoin is great and it will grow and add a lot of value.  
He does not buy and sell bitcoin at different prices, he always buys Bitcoin, if he can sell something else to pay for his expenses he will. (That would be me guess, I may be wrong).  
If he actively buys and sells Bitcoin at various times because he expect the price to go up or down, then I will admit that I was wrong. It just seems he is saying that he always buys Bitcoin and that it is the last asset he has that he will sell because it has such great long term potential both in value and price.

Which was why I said "you may" as in "there is chance". If you read that as me implying that everyone or even most people in the US is in the top 1% of income then you read something into what I wrote which was not there.  
The full time working population of the US is 130 Million, which is, 1.7% of the world population.  


So that would actually mean that about half of the full time working US citizens are in the top 1% of income in the world technically.  
What we consider a reasonable income, $32k yearly, is in a global perspective the top 1% of income. Which most individuals in the US does not make, since most are not working full time. But of those who are working full-time it is not uncommon to make that or more.  
A lot of the people who protested against the wealth of the top 1% of income in the US was themselves the top 1% of the income in the world, that is the sort of irony.  
Within the 1% there is a 1% as well, and within that 1% there is another 1%.

Because the 4k limit has some psychological impact.  
The last month+ it has mostly been about guessing where between 3-4k the price will move, that it will bounce up or down. Most people generally express that they think that the price is unlikely to go and stay above 4k.  
Last time the price went over 4k in January it was a small spike as well.  
The price stayed at or above 6k for the better part of 2018, then it tumbled down under 4k in a couple weeks, and it has been between 3-4k since then.  
If the price remains between 3-4k for a couple more months, then shoots up above 4k once again there will likely be something similar.  
You are right that sudden price increases/decreases are not unusual, but that could explain why there is some extra fuzz this time.

Depends which country you are in, best to consult with an local professional.  
There are generally two options.  
The people who gave you the coins paid capital gains taxes when they paid you. Your reward was the price of the Bitcoin that you got, this may be considered your income which is taxed.  
Or they did not pay capital gains tax when they gave it to you. In that case you need to let them know what the cost basis for the coins are so that you can use that to calculate the taxes, but if they did no inform you, and they are following the law, they likely already paid capital gains taxes.  
Best to consult with a specialist.

The whitepaper says that there is no need to introduce inflation under one condition, and that one condition being that there is sufficient fees over the long term to pay for the POW. Meaning that if there is not enough fees in the far future, some inflation will have to be introduced.  
If there is enough fees, 21M forever.  
If there is not enough fees, 21M + 100 BTC per year (example).

There was a special case with Cyprus in 2013.
Since they have adopted the Euro some years earlier they were unable to print more money and take a bit of purchasing power from everyone with high inflation. Instead they took the nominal Euro directly from the accounts of citizens, that feels different and was the reason that they rushed to Bitcoin. Had they printed the amount they directly confiscated there would be no capital flight as it would have shown up indirectly in prices over time.
The example of China is one that we saw play out in early/mid 2017 when the news about tightening the capital control and laws about Exchanges/Bitcoin swung the price of Bitcoin up and down. 2017 was the year where Japan, South Korea and the US replaced China in terms of buying/trading Bitcoin, almost exclusively price speculation in the US while there was a higher enthusiasm for getting Bitcoin to play a role as payment in Japan.
Russian currency seems pretty stable last two years, though inflation in terms of consumer prices seems to have risen last two years partly because of a 2% increase in VAT taxes.
The issues in South Africa is the most relevant in the case of the state confiscating land from the Boers (and much more bad stuff of course).
Venezuela is the most crypto example, in that people move crypto into the state bypassing the sanctions and people use crypto to buy paper USD that they then use to pay for services. That is the closest we have to where crypto makes a difference in their daily lives. The total amount of capital that is stored in Bitcoin in Venezuela is still comparatively small as there is no wealth accumulation stored in Bitcoin, mostly about survival.
I fully agree with your sentiment that taxes OUGHT to be based around what works for people, and removing the income tax, payroll tax, corporate tax and moving it to consumption based taxation is more sensible economically as it rewards the activities that we want in the way of not penalizing income and labor/industry/investments.
EDIT: I just think that removing the (supposedly) progressive income tax and corporate tax and adding VAT is not possible to get political support from citizens.

I fully agree with you. There are some who conflate revenue with profit and are really stubborn about it.  
Good verifiable examples is in games with perfect information and economies like an MMOs. People can not stop themselves from using material that can be sold directly for 1000 credit to make a item that they sell for 400 credit. To them they earned 400 credit from making the item instead of paying 600 credit to make it.  
I think part of the issue is that people feel judged whenever they do something for fun that requires work that does not net them a gain. Not that they personally care, but that they do not want to lose standing with others.  
There are people who enjoy collecting physical stuff as a hobby that will argue that they are in fact doing some sort of investing strategy which they happen to enjoy. Even if they actually never plan on selling anything it transforms their hobby into something more respectable.

That would be pretty nice. There are some seeming paradoxes that pop up where no increase in the prices of goods and no increases in wages over time causes a slight increase in measured purchasing power as consumers adjust their preferences towards inferior goods or cheaper substitutes.  
I can only see a political reason to avoid the margin of error as it would give leeway to say a number within the margin of error and add some qualifier that made it technically true. Like using household and individual income interchangeably or changes in unemployment without the labor participation rate.

The ways fees work in LN incentives LN nodes that want to get the most traffic to open channels that goes through the main centers of activity and have enough liquidity. It will likely be some cluster of larger nodes that connects to each other and to most nodes in few channels.  
There will always be some amount that will be to large to be routed to some point, but for small enough amounts it can become good enough to the point where it does not need to be solved for the structure and size of the LN to work.  
There will also be the effect of the size of the fees where there will be some standard minimum which will be good enough for 99%+ for cases to be 99%+ sure but where paying under that minimum will have some risk.

The main reason to not increase the block size is not based on technological limits currently, there are soft limits but they are all above 2MB per block. The intended effect of 1MB is to make LN a necessity now rather than later, same with putting pressure on reducing the size per transactions. There is also the case made for not increasing the rate of growth for the blockchain itself in bytes even if it was possible to keep full nodes as small as possible.  
There will never be a reason to increase the limit over 1MB as long as there is a way to get in-out of LN or use services that lets users transact Bitcoin without going through on-chain no matter the capabilities of the underlying infrastructure.

I am saying that Taxation is Theft and that the State is using Violence. Even that the income tax in the US is arguably unconstitutional, though there will never be a court that concedes that.  
My argument is that almost everyone supports certain forms of theft and violence done by the state, that taxation being theft is true, but it is not an argument as there is nothing, including violence, that is not relegated to the state. People disagree when the state should, and to which degree it should, use violence and theft, but there is (almost) nobody arguing against the state stealing and using violence even when it can not be justified by a crime. And it is the general sentiment that theft from everyone by the state is the lesser evil than what they imagine the alternative to be.  
Not because it is just or moral or good, but because it is the only stable solution over time against competing states.  
There are people who argue that Taxation is not Theft, that it is just and moral, and that it is voluntary since anyone can chose to not pay tax and go to jail or move out of the country if they do not consent. I am not making that case, just that there is no nation state alternative to taxation, so for me it is about finding the least unjust way to do it. Acknowledging that it is unjust.

If it was possible to make free unlimited energy generators in the world there would still be a limit on how much we could use before the heat from the energy usage would make earth uninhabitable.  
For Bitcoin unlimited energy would just mean that there would a lot more machines, and the production and non-energy operating costs of them would reach an new equilibrium.  
Unless the mining machines is free, and storage is free, and the labor to install and maintain is free, and the energy is free. In that case the mining machines grow in number util they boil the earth.

If I understood you correctly you mentioned that it would not be possible long term to do on-chain transactions (i.e putting money into and taking it out of cold storage in small portions) on Bitcoin.  
The people who want to transact on-chain and control their private keys directly without going centralized services need to move into something other than Bitcoin, if the fees per transaction on Bitcoin is to expensive to do that because of the high demand from second layer solutions and centralized services.

I understand the adjusted difficulty 2016 blocks meaning that there will always be some miners that mine. And as long as there is someone transacting on-chain there will always be a reward even after no more Bitcoin is issued.  
The only thing a higher block reward (fees or built-in) does is making attacking 51% attacks more expensive. 51% attacks can at worst reverse transactions/mine empty blocks. All funds on-chain always equally safe.  
The block reward only needs to be high enough for standard use, anything higher enables that larger amounts (millions+) can get accepted with fewer confirmations.  
At a time in the far future, when block rewards are very close to 0 (or even 0), the fees will pay for the miners, if the total fees per block gets consistently to low, and this results is frequent 51% attacks. Then, and only then, will it be an argument to increase some extremely small inflation, if only temporarily, to secure the chain.  
I am not saying that is going to happen, or that it is more likely than not, only that it could happen in that scenario.

If Bitcoin ever becomes a good stable store of value, it will also mean that it is no longer suited for increasing wealth by investing/speculating in it as it implies that it will retain a stable price (in purchasing power) over time.  
That is also the same reason that it is not possible to get a inflation adjusted return from holding gold over the long term, only by buying it when it is low and selling it why it is high. Inflation adjusted over the very long term Gold retains its price.

My guess is wallets and payment systems that issue IOUs backed by Bitcoin. There may be transactions over the LN where users send Bitcoin through their apps which then sends the amounts through the LN without the user actually having the private key.  
Something like CirclePay or CircleInvest or variant where users gets exposure to the price and the ability to relay transactions on the LN without actually owning the Bitcoin directly.  
There will not be an issue with buying and selling on any large scale exchanges no matter how high the fees get, and the majority of users will (against best practices) store their crypto on the exchanges.  
A potential fee spike because of price changes will most affect those who have a lot of smaller transactions already stored on-chain which did not consolidate their inputs in time, they may have their funds locked away by cost-prohibitive fees until a wave blows over. It will be the same with opening and closing LN channels directly but that supposes that users will use their private keys to do that instead of relying on services that does it for them where they use their credit on that service. But fees will never stop anyone from buying and selling Bitcoin that is not already on the chain via the exchanges unless there is an unlikely emptying of the order books.  
For on-chain transactions to reliably happen in the next block at a fixed fee without there being a chance of bidding and getting in the mempool requires that the capacity is way higher than the average use in transactions, and that stopped being the case already in 2015.  
TLDR: My guess is that On-Chain will be used for large scale transactions and to move Bitcoin in-out of LN where users can spend Bitcoin without having the private key by using custodial services like exchanges that have programs that they can use their credited bitcoin to send transactions indirectly through the LN.

Not Basel-II.  
All that is needed is a large enough section of US citizens/USD holders knowing that the purchasing power of their US dollars will decrease but still not sell it/put it into circulation for the greater good. Maybe some sort of PeaceBond that people can buy to combat inflation.  
Do not think that it is going to happen though.  
The FED aims to keep the interest at 3% in the coming years, best case scenario is lower % GDP growth per year without stagflation. But I think it is unlikely that unemployment can remain low without labor participation going down as well.  
My ill informed guess is that GDP growth % will slow down without higher (over 3%) inflation on average the next four years.

I think industry and money is some of the more misunderstood things in the bible.  
It is not money itself or making money that is bad, there are plenty of encouragement to being industrious and to put capital to good use. The problem is to love money at the cost of everything else.  
The person in "Camel in the needle" story had his money as his highest attachment and was unable to put anything above it while claiming that he most wanted to enter the kingdom of heaven, he contacted Jesus and to know what was needed. Jesus offered him to become a follower on the condition that he first gave up up his wealth and then came to him. And he was to attached to his earthly wealth to do it.  
There was also a general moral about not hiding money away or waste it on frivolous consumption but to invest it increasing productivity in the form of livestock and tools. Just be careful to not confuse wealth itself with what was most important.  
Protestant Christianity is arguably very pro industry and markets.

I think I misunderstood you originally.  
There is definitely an issue with enforcing property rights in many cases for regular people as it is often not a high priority. Often the result of low resources. But if property rights are not enforced in one place the resourceful people who have property will pack up and leave for another better place. That is the main incentive to enforce property right, to maintain the revenue for the city/state.  
Crypto is extra tricky since it is very easy for a person to try insurance fraud with losses and a lot of the activity with crypto is not through regular regulated markets. Hacking and fraud is also likely to happen from outside the US. The insurance price for crypto would be extremely high.  
Unlike in banking and credit cards there is no way to resolve theft/fraud by reversing the payment with crypto, once it is lost, stolen, or there is fraud there is little to no chance of finding the criminal or reversing the payment. I do not see what the state can do in that case as long as crypto.

There is no way you can get 8% interest on anything, not USD, especially not crypto.  
And when there is some interest, like lending out crypto to margin trading on exchanges, there is a risk that there will issues with the exchange that creates a loss for the lenders. So no way to get risk free anything in crypto.  
There a multiple red flags on the site in their investment page.  
$20 minimum (common for scams for some reason)  
Recommended minimum holding periods, 3-6 months.  
They will trade your crypto, you have to cover 100% of the losses, they get to keep 18% of the profit.
I have no idea how their earn program works, because it is not written on the site, but the fact that they want crypto deposits specifically is a red flag.
They promote referrals and have high referral bonuses, not good.  
Their selling point seems to be that people buying and locking their token will be able to get a prepaid card, but why?  
.........................  
If you have no trouble buying and selling Bitcoin on regular exchanges I see no reason to try your luck with this site. Any site that offers interest on crypto, especially high interest is to good to be true, likely a disaster waiting to happen.

If Bitcoin required a lot of ongoing work for the user it would defeat the whole purpose.  
Bitcoin is a speculative asset that does not require any work once it is secured in cold storage which has a high volatility and uncertain future.

I can be used as a description of general support and good beliefs about the future. Being a supporter and believer in something besides the price. I agree. I think there are better terms that do not get price into the picture, but that is a personal taste. Permabull could be said to be a statement both about the price and the future.  
An silly example that fits the non-price permabull would be to be a bermabull about a stablecoin, in that it is the best coin which will be the most stable and secure for the longest and has the best qualities, it may become a new gold standard for currency pegged transfers.  
I think that in this particular instance of the use of Permabull, that twitter thread, it is a reference to the price of Bitcoin going up long term, and that the fact that the price will go up over the very long term makes every day a good day to buy Bitcoin no matter what the short term price changes are.  
There is an additional factor, Adam is definitely positive and optimistic about the overall future and value of Bitcoin independently of the price. He argues that the fact that Bitcoin will grow and become better and more used over time will lead to a higher price.  
So he is both positive about the value and the price long term.

He is specifically making the point about always buying Bitcoin because of a increase in price over time in that twitter thread.  
I agree that it can be used to say "I believe in great things for Bitcoin forever" something like that. But in that context, in that thread, it talks about always buying Bitcoin and not selling it because it is a good investment in purchasing power increasing over time.  
Always buying Bitcoin, no matter which price, and buying extra when the price is down implies having a long term view about the price specifically.  
The value of Bitcoin in sociability and the price per Bitcoin can be separated, they are not exactly the same, Adam (IMO) says that he thinks that Both the price and the value/use of Bitcoin will go up over time, but that his constant buying is motivated by the price he foresees eventually.  
But I may be misunderstanding or misinterpreting Adams statements, apologies to if I made a mistake, and I appreciate if I am corrected, I do not mean to say things that are not true. (And I make mistakes).

There is no dispute if a LN transaction is cheaper than Bitcoin Cash, it is. Both in $ and in sat/transaction.  
There is also no dispute sending a 1 sat/byte sending a Bitcoin transaction is cheaper than BCH (in sats), it is. Also no dispute if the 1 sat/byte transaction will be confirmed on BTC, it will.  
It is (in sats) cheaper to send 1 sat/byte transaction to a LN node, then send a 1 sat/transaction, because you save more than 1 sat per transaction with segwit.  
The challenge was about making a video taking the time from being on-chain, to getting into LN, to then sending the LN transaction. It was not about having an established LN node and using it cheaper or faster than Bitcoin Cash. That was not the challenge you responded to.

It is true that the total fees collected divided by the number of nodes would get close to the cheapest possible way to run a node over time. It can not go over that at least.  
But the fees collected on the LN will not be distributed evenly, the nodes that is best managed, most well connected, and connect to the right places will be way above the average fees collected, while most regular nodes will be way below the average fees collected. But even among the best of nodes there will be competition, so the margins will be slim there as well over time.  
If it can be done automatically or scaled up at a low cost it will not be profitable.

Gold is about preserving wealth yes, over the short term, which your example illustrates, to hedge against sudden downturns, especially when there is no income or ability to wait that downturn out.  
It is not for long term saving for young people who want to increase their investments until they get old.  
Adjusted for inflation the price of gold can go down over a decade+, but way slower than anything else could, the most extreme example in recent history was it going down 50%+ over two years+ (adjusted for inflation).  
From 1980 to 2000 it was better to hold USD in a 0% interest bank account, so there are exceptions to it, but as you say, if things are going south it is a good bet (if it does not become illegal to own gold, which while unlikely is more likely to happen in extreme situations). But Gold tend to go up when the market goes down and the other way around, so having an adjusted portion of both gives growth and a hedge in case of downturns.

If it is more profitable, all other things being equal, businesses will do it.  
Customers will use whatever is easiest, most convenient and affords them protections.  
Crypto offers no protections and has some risks and costs, transactions are public and permanent, it can't be more convenient than fiat because of taxes and having to rely on custodial services to get around private-key management and to get the ability to get refunds/cashback and in worst case scenario using chargeback in case a valid refund is denied.  
Bitcoin is legal now, but almost no businesses take it.  
Even if there was some marginal cost saving taking crypto per transaction the service would not increase their revenue unless they get additional customers they would not otherwise get. People who use crypto also use regular payments, so they are not lost when there is no crypto. What is needed is a large enough number of people who will only pay using crypto, or prioritize any service that takes crypto, that is where extra revenue would come from.  
Another way to put it is that if a large portion of people boycott something unless they do something, they will tend to do that thing, as long as it does not alienate those who do not boycott.

Any Bitcoin amount that is on a hot wallet, any device that is connected to the internet, is on a timer.

Anyone who thinks that Bitcoin will be the best long term investment:

Those with no money can sell the future ownership Bond/Gold after 10 years with a contract at a discount today and then Buy Bitcoin they can touch whenever.  
This question makes no sense.  
The question should be: You will be frozen for 10 years, you have to put all your savings/investment into just one asset that will not be touched until you wake up in 10 years.

You need to buy Bitcoin first, then send what you bought to the address that they give you.  
However, to buy Bitcoin you will have to give up your personal information, and when you send the Bitcoin it can be traced back to you later since the ledger is public and everything on it is stored forever. If the person fails to honor their promise the Bitcoin can not be retrieved/reversed unlike credit cards.

You have two options when you cash out your Bitcoin and get asked about the source.  
1. Tell the truth, you bought it for X usd at X time and now selling it for Y dollars at Y time.  
2. Lie and say that you got the Bitcoin recently.  
If you go for route 1. you will pay the minimum tax on the Bitcoin (long term holding) capital gains, no worries and you have proof in buying and selling. Cheapest and easiest option.  
If you go route 2. you will either have to pay taxes on the whole amount if you can not document the cost basis from the fake gift maker at the time the gift was made. (You inherit the cost basis if it is a gift).  
Or you will pretend you earned the Bitcoin and pay income tax on it, higher taxrate. Or pretend you sold something for it, but that will also have to be documented and taxed.  
If you get audited they will see you bought X bitcoin in total on X exchange and sold a similar amount of bitcoin on another service years later, they will put two and two together, if you try to give them fake documentation of you having spent it (sent it to yourself) then later cashed it out, you will likely be caught for tax evasion.  
If you really hate the idea of taxes you can always finds ways to donate it without paying taxes on the capital gains.

 Inflation-linked bonds works for retirement accounts that can defer taxes, not it is not suited for a person who wants to keep their purchasing power in daily life, it can cost the person money short term that they might not have.  
The inflation-adjusting gets taxed right away and at a higher rate than capital gains.  
If inflation shoots up 8% on year on a 1% interest inflation adjusted bond it would mean having to pay 1.25% more in taxes that year than the interest payment. Any period where the interest after taxes is smaller than the taxes paid from the par value adjustment is an extra cost that has to be paid now.  
If the the interest from the bond is smaller than the taxation from the inflation adjusting itself it also means that purchasing power goes down over time.  
A 0 interest inflation adjusted bond bought at par value that last forever would have an 25% tax for all inflation it hedges against, paid every year. Which is better than a 100% tax on inflation but the fact that hedging against inflation is seen as income is pretty silly on the face of it.

Don't think anyone has been able to send 100 sats in a transaction for a long time on-chain just because of the dust limit. But Bitcoin is planning to have a higher cost per on-chain transaction to pay for the POW long term, it does not aim to have basically-free on-chain transactions.  
The easiest way would be to get them a custodial LN wallet on mobile and send them 100 sats, they can send that back and forth about 100 times with 1 sat/transaction fees or get Bitcoin on the CashApp.  
On-Chain would be for cold storage if they want to buy larger amounts of it long term.

Great commentary on the points from kurz, this is just some nitpicky comments on your comments which may be wrong, just my view:
\&gt; Venmo and Squarecash basically front you the money and "fake" it being fast, but real settlement actually says day(s). Even SEPA in Europe takes a day. Mostly untrue.
It is fast for the user, that is what counts. People don't care about what happens under the hood, the press the bottom, the number shows up, all is good. The transfer from one account to another is not talking about the ultimate settlement, just the practical transfer for the user. So I would say this is a true statement. Especially when taking the frad-protection that comes with slower and more reversibel transactions. It is instant for the user, but can be reversed in case of dispute for the user. (From the buyers, most people, a win-win).
\&gt; It's overall trend is up as a store of value, but yes there are some gnarly bubble cycles.
A good store of value is stable, it swinging wildly in price makes it a poor store of value, even if it trends upwards. The stability over time is what is sought after. It also can not keep trending upwards since the only gains that can be made is from the losses of someone else. On net, the sum people have lost money on Bitcoin (all gains - all losses).
\&gt; I think this question can only be answered with the test of time - how well does it hedge against fiat currencies and their inflation rates once the "bubble era" of crypto is over.
The question is how it compares to the best stores of value, not how it compares to fiat currencies specifically. Sensible interest/bonds will be about the same as inflation for someone who wants to keep their purchasing power over time. Not putting fiat under the maddress, that is not what is the alternative store of value.
\&gt; Yep. Price \* inflation + velocity of money (fees) = energy consumption. Eventually for bitcoin, the slowing inflation will lower this significantly
Which is the crux of the issue, the POW needs to be in the billion of dollars every year range at a large enough scale, which comes in the form of burning resources. Average on-chain transaction could be $10+ which each represent moving Bitcoin in and out of LN, but LN is not a way to store savings in Bitcoin and it is an extra step in setting up Bitcoin. No matter what, the less resources Bitcoin burns, the less secure it is, there is no way around this with POW.
But the last point may be the most pressing.
\&gt; Remains to be seen. Other implementations of bitcoin using other backend systems have their own pro's and con's.
That is the big mystery factor. Only if we call the biggest, best, most popular crypto for Bitcoin will it be true that the future of Crypto is Bitcoin for sure.

I think the underlying sentiment in "Provide for themselves" is ultimately about bad incentives for working and voting. And "themselves" is often meant to include their family and community.  
UBI all other things being equal has some disincentive to work.  
Increasing UBI could become a campaign promise that keeps escalating.  
A combination of those two could be destabilizing.

On the flipside without UBI, if a sufficiently large amount of people stagnate or decrease their income over time by no fault of their own while the overall wealth in a nation increases and inequality grows drastically it will cause societal breakdown and radical political movements succeeding.

A serious stock market crash will mean that people will have less money to spend in general and even though the aftermath of a huge stock market crash is on average the best time to buy people will be hesitant to do it even if they have the money for it.

Gresham's law does not apply because it speaks about something very specific. More than one commodity money at the same area, legally accepted and with the same price.
Then people will spend whatever is the cheapest/lowest quality commodity currency to not waste the higher quality commodity currency.
If someone thinks the price of Bitcoin is on a downwards price trends forever they will not gradually spend their Bitcoin, they will sell it, then keep spending fiat as usual since that is the most convenient, both in practice and for tax compliance.
Bitcoin needs to be free from capital gains tax, as fast and easy to use as fiat payment on fiat mobile or contactless payments, and there needs to be no fees when buying more Bitcoin. And even then Bitcoin transactions can not be reversed in case something go wrong, so the customer would need to have some bonus or discount to entice them to use Bitcoin even then. That discount would have to at least match whatever cash back the credit card gives.

The proof is in the pudding.
I personally like the concept behind everyone getting a income without any conditions. But how it plays out will be how it plays out, it needs to work in practice.
Unfortunately all UBI experiments I have seen in wealthy nations have been variants like "Single get $10k, couples get $7.5k each, disabled get $15k" which is not universal at all and open up for fraud, ie co-habituating couples pretending to not live together for higher income. Even without fraud it incentives people to don't move together. (Edit: And the save administrative overhead and legal cases would happen as current welfare)
Or they have had conditions such as: The person needs to have low working hours, be unemployed or have a low income already.
But the best experiments that closes resembles UBI has the same results: People do not work more, but they feel a lot better and have more ability to participate in society at large outside of work.
The real benefit of UBI would be that people have a unconditional security net that lets them take extra risks and do work that they are more inclined to do. As you say, there is a real cost to people getting into various work for the wrong reasons where them working that job creates more costs than value even if they worked for free.

The arguments I have heard in favor of Trezor is that it is open source and has a long history, while the cheapest version of ledger is usually a bit cheaper than the cheapest version of Trezor.  
The important part when you get a hardware wallet is that it is from a reputable seller, no tampering with the package, no pre-filled seedcards. You will generate the seed on the device and then write it down in person and confirming it on the device.  
As long as the hardware wallet is real, and you follow the instructions, keep the seed safe, then you will have cold storage Bitcoin that will not be taken from anyone not able to get to you or the seed.

Everyone has an intuitive understanding that when they get something they want or achieve a goal, they feel some short lived relief and happiness before they become restless and look for the next thing or goal they can work towards. There are some who are just content with drifting and not doing or aiming for much, but that is rare.  
Lacking money and being in financial distress brings a lot of troubles, but having enough money to retire does not solve any problems that are not related to financial distress. And there is a lot of problems that a person can face that is not related to money or work.  
However, the only way to experience that for certain is to get in that situation, and at that point it just sounds like a strange complaint for everyone else. Someone stumbling into sudden wealth, like those who win in lotteries will more often than not be worse off in a couple years.

Bitcoin gave a probabilistic solution to the double spend problem. That was pretty cool.  
All other things being equal, a hypothetical secure POS coin is better than the same coin with POW. The burning of resources is only a means to the end of securing the coin, it is not itself good in any way. Good for some yes, but not on net, even with zero environmental impact the cost of mining gets distributed to everyone who has Bitcoin. That is the reason why the halving is always seen great news, less of a burden in the form of selling pressure from mining.  
Granting that POW is the best and a net good, that the POW has gradually declining mining rewards that get replaced with fees from use is best, and that the future will have the world running on a crypto. It is still a tossup which crypto that will be, and anyone who was not in Bitcoin from the early days would have an interest on supporting the newer alternative. Unless the Bitcoin holders have enormous political, economic and military sway in the world there is no way it will be the world currency no matter how much people like it.  
But on the flipside, from a purely financial standpoint, it could very well be that Bitcoin keeps going up in price for the coming decades not matter how ill suited it is for anything but putting savings in. It may go up for generations before it hits its final peak and starts to decline. It is a gamble and in just pure numbers it does not matter if it is good or bad in the big picture.

If the last halving is the expectation the best time to buy would have been 1 year 5 months+ before the halving, and the best period to sell would be 1 year 5 months+ after the halving.  
 [   
When the best buy/sell period is almost 3 years apart with something happening every 4 years in the middle, it is hard to say that it was a catalyst for anything.  
75% of the time will be 1.5 years before after each halving, there has been two major price bubbles each happening 4 years apart from each other, anything that happens 4 years apart will fall at the same place compared to the halving and look like a solid trend.  
The expectation is that there will be a steady climb upwards the coming year, but what if that does not happen? If we are at 3k next year the weak 2 data-point pattern will have been broken anyways.

The criminals either convert the Bitcoin into a privacy coin by using stolen customer information to create fake exchange accounts, or they use non-KYC exchanges or even fraudulent exchanges that are set up specifically to clean crypto, then can also move crypto through gambling sites and other hot wallets that are not exchanges.  
The knowledgeable/well-connected criminals have a very low risk of being caught, and they will earn more from getting $100 worth of Bitcoin and spend %10 to launder it than to only get $10 directly into a privacy coin.  
Even if they got a lot of money in a privacy coin they would have to do some money laundering to be able to put that in their bank accounts, create fake income and pay taxes on that fake income. Unless they live in a corrupt state or some sort of extreme tax haven.

It can only be known by someone else if SN personally told them about it with the intent of the new person being a impostor that SN put in place. But at that point that would be a spokesperson for SN, and if SN was sensible they would put in a way to have proof of the spokeperson not being the real deal in case they did not do as they wanted.  
SN could encode their real ID + message if they wanted to prevent any impostors. Even if SN themselves claimed to be a impostor or spokesperson, with a fake proof from a fake account that would prove that they were not, made by SN themselves.  
Or SN could take the Name+SSN+ContactInformation+message and encode that, having agreed with the person that they would be the person who took credit.  
Ultimately it is impossible to ultimately prove that any written text is created by anyone, even if there is livestreamed videofeed of them writing and publishing it to the blockchain there could be someone feeding the words to them in their ears.

I am probably using the wrong terms to be fair:P  
There is a inflow of $7,000 in that case, but also an equal opposite outflow on the other side. Only question is at which price, when the total buyers are more willing to buy than the total sellers are willing to sell at a certain price the price goes up. It takes a fraction of $1 to move the market cap up $1, but the estimation I have seen most often is 50x.  
Here is a graph from a Bitcoin fund during 2018, there was a equal or larger outflow outside it, but it definitely had a huge effect on the prices still:  [  
A single person can invest their money into Bitcoin, but only an equal amount as someone else is divesting. There is no capital in Bitcoin the coin, only indirectly in mining, exchanges and related businesses and the only thing that is directly related to the price is the mining revenue. Headlines about X dollars being invested in Bitcoin is always in companies, R&amp;D, partnerships, platforms.  
Every trade the distribution and price of Bitcoin changes a tiny amount. The only tangible economic effect is the cost basis for the buyer and the realized gain/loss for the seller, for taxes.  
Assuming that mining on net at max has 0 profit margin, then the the total amount of resources used to mine Bitcoin is at most 10B, it could be higher if the sum of all miners has been unprofitable.  
Realized Cap using the time and price the coins were moved last works assuming that people trade on-chain and coins are not moved internally. Most trades happen off-chain and large movements of coins are in and out of cold storage or to-from addresses that the person/group controls themselves.  
Fradulent exchanges, market manipulation and various theft makes it hard to estimate the traditional gains for buyers of Bitcoin on net compared to other investments or market indexes.

The idea that the mining reward is the main driving force of the price, outside of self-fulfilling prophecy buying only works if some conditions is in place.  
.. People who hold Bitcoin is not interested in selling at any price  
.. The total amount of new buyers/money is not affected by the price, steady flow of money.  
.. Miners sell the bitcoin they mine when they mine it  
As you mention, the wast majority of all the Bitcoin that can ever be sold is already mined, it is the willingness to sell from the holders that determines the selling mostly, true for the rest of Bitcoins history (unless changes).  
If people spend more money when the price is rising, and less when it is dropping, then that feedback-mechanic will be the dominant one unless the total amount of buyers is non-existent.  
The portion of what miners sell of what they mine is also a factor, a smaller one though, and only a fraction of what the total effect of the mining reward is.  
.............................  
Holders plan on selling at a price, new buyers buy more when the price is going up and less when the price is going down, miners sell some but not all of what they mine when they mine it.

He could not actually have been significantly wealthier if he bought Bitcoin in the early days for two reasons.  
Him buying up Bitcoin early would have pushed up the price fast which would have changed the dynamic of Bitcoin, he could only ever hope to get a fraction of the money that come in after him, but who would want to buy into something that one person controlled a large stake of? That would defeat the purpose of it being decentralized.   
Even if he did actually manage to get a large stake of Bitcoin from the early days without distorting the price, like millions of Bitcoin, he would be unable to sell it for anything but a fraction of the current market cap. The first Billion he sold would tank a large portion of the current market cap, if he sold it gradually it would put an additional downwards pressure on the price in addition to the current mining rewards.  
The "Tokyo Whale" who sold Bitcoin from MtGox at $230M in 2018 had huge effects on the market, and that was supposedly OTC and trying to minimize the effect on the price.  
If the original 1 million coins get moved the price will tank for the same reason, people know that there will be billions of potential selling pressure coming, no coins have to be sold, just the expectation of them changing hands will be enough.  
All other being equal, and W.B having a couple million Bitcoin from early days and him selling them at good times could have netted him some Billions. But his net worth increases by billions every year on average and he have given tens of billions away to charity already. Bitcoin would not have made a difference to him.

People mix to preserve their privacy.  
The ledger is public and permanent and transactions can be linked together for anyone who does not take steps to prevent it.  
The problem is not that the state finds out the ID of which address, but that bad actors do. Which is why we see stuff like dusting attacks, attempts to link addresses together to a person so that they can be identified and attacked. Most people use KYC exchanges to buy and sell, so any mixing that happens is to prevent others from linking their ID on the chain itself, not to hide their buying/selling on exchanges.  
Îf a person can't preserve their privacy on-chain it can become a huge liability in the future even if all they do is store their Bitcoin or pay regular bills with it.  
Same reason people should not say how much Bitcoin they have in general, it paints a huge red target on them for attacks.

People don't move into the bank account, they move into the uninhabited house, adverse possession, they then get the legal rights to the house if they fill the criteria for a long time. The sticky situation is when the owner of the house comes back after a long enough period and there is a legal battle over who gets it. Don't know if the US counts as civilized but they got that, standard in English common law. If the state tries got get in contact over the money in a dormant account without any answer for whatever reason for a long enough period, they can add it to their budget, they have to return the amount to the account owner if they later claim it. So not actually stealing the money, just taking it out of the bank account, using it in the budget, and giving it back if it is later claimed, burrowing it would be a better word than take, but that implies expressed agreement.

The gold standard effectively ended in the US in 1933, then there was a period with price fixed gold in USD for foreign traders and an attempt at a international standard with the Bretton Woods system until fiat in 1971, free floating currency exchange rate mostly in the 90s and onward.  
The reason that the US abandoned the gold standard in 1933 was because the economy was not doing great and the general consensus among economists is that leaving the gold standard was beneficial for the US economy, only question was how much of the recovery was a result of it. That does not mean that they are right, just that it is the common perception today.  
Just as it is not possible to say that since the economy has been doing relatively well the last 25 years it means that it is because of, and not despite, the current monetary or political policies. Economists argue over that constantly.  
The circulating supply of gold inflates over time, but the prices in a economy with the gold standard will swing between inflation and deflation depending on how it is doing.  
Even if having a currency that increased its purchasing power gradually was desirable it would not be possible to pull off, it is however possible to aim for keeping a currency that loses its purchasing power slowly.

All gold in banks go to the federal reserve in 1933, USD no longer redeemable in gold, in 1934 everyone has to hand in all the gold they got. At the time the US has all the gold and most of the gold in the world they increased the price of gold about 70% in USD. The government collected all the private gold, makes holding gold illegal and then change the fixed price per once of gold. At that point the gold standard in the US existed for foreign exchange only. The last remnants of the gold standard ended in 1971.  
Bretton Woods came in 1944 and it functionally made USD the gold standard by proxy since most of the gold in the world was in the US and gold was redeemable only for foreign countries on the standard. There was not a fixed number of USD per ounce of gold, foreign states held many times the amount of USD than could possibly be redeemed and once they started to redeem their USD for gold in large enough numbers the "Gold Standard" that was Bretton Woods just ended and the USD took the place of the gold standard.

I did not mention dead-man switch because it was redundant and plausible deniability implies that it can't be tortured out of the person, or the person may be tortured for something they don't have.  
Of course, if the hash is from random of lost data even torture would not be able to get it out, to bad for SN, forever tortured. And unless they capture the person for the rest of their lives there will always be a possibility for them to have messages that has not been disclosed that superseded the previous messages. And if SN wanted to make sure that he was not capture and tortured/disappeared forever there would be an extreme dead-man-switch, and a plausible deniability dead-man-switch, and even a warranty canary just for the sake of it.   
In either case, there is only one person who is able to decode a hidden message written by SN, which is SN or anyone that SN gives out the information to.

Holders can only create selling pressure with what they hold, press the price downwards.  
Lost coins works as a "market cap multiplier" giving a false impression of the actual potential sellers, but other than that it has no effect on the price outside of preventing downwards pressure from would-be-holders selling.  
The real price floor will always be set by new buyers that will buy up anything below X USD no matter what the future prospects of Bitcoin is, alternatively a price that is so low that virtually every Bitcoin holder don't bother trying to sell because it will not be worth the hassle.

The inflation of USD supply is closer to 6% yearly, but since the economic growth is a couple percent the actual inflation is lower.  
Gold inflation (circulating) is also affected by the price of gold, the higher the price gets, the faster gold mining happens, and the lower the price is, the less gold will be mind. There is some time delay, and it is only one of the factors, but there is a built-in price stabilization.  
Even then inflation adjusted price went down 80% from 80-00, only to pick up 300% since then.

LocalBitcoin has started with KYC, you can meet in person and exchange physical cash but there will be a significant fee/cost, there may be a agent or criminal on the other side depending on the amount, time and place.  
If you manage to exchange crypto for a bank/credit transfer you risk chargeback or having the transaction reversed later if the buyer is dishonest or the funds that pay for it was stolen/fraudulent.  
Even if it succeeds and you have the income in the bank you can run into trouble later if you are not able to document the income. At least if it is a significant amount.  
If your gross income is under $35k you pay no federal taxes on long term capital gains for that year for any amount that does not put you over that limit, and the state/local taxes may also be very low if you have low income. You only pay taxes on the actual gain, not the whole sale.  
Unless the money is from criminal activity and you are trying to launder it there is no good financial reason to try to avoid long term capital gains taxes on crypto. You could even end up spending more on avoiding taxes in spread/fees than you would if you just paid the taxes.

Anyone who saw this subreddit from start to end of 2017 saw the shift of new people flooding in, almost all the posts and comments in the peak period was new accounts, new people, instead of more caution for every $1000 up there was more and more celebration. Look at the december 19 frontpage

The top post is the most telling where a financial advisor says 80% of his clients wants to buy Bitcoin and how he was legally barred from encouraging them to buy it.  
Any voices of reason and moderation will get drowned out near the top and the bottom. Same reason the "Don't Invest Recklessly" was pinned and is pinned now.

You will probably get something like upwards to 10% in cost by a combination of fees/spread and if you live in the US you may even be required to give up personal information to the ATM to be able to withdraw, there is cameras on them anyways.  
You can use Bitcoin as a tool in tax evasion if you really want to, but why would you want to? Unless you are against paying taxes in as a principle you will be better off just paying the long term tax on capital gains. You only pay for the actual nominal price increase.

That is standard with regular currency as well. If some bank accounts are under a certain limit, and not touched for a long enough period, the money can be taken. Same with houses that nobody has been in or taken care of for a long time, someone who moves in and takes care of it will get it legally if enough time passes.

Smart to not reveal your ID when creating something like Bitcoin.  
Since it is based on cryptography the creator could hide their ID in a way that let them chose to reveal it in whole or part later. Giving themselves the option of later coming out if it is advantageous or remain hidden if that is advantageous.

I think you overestimate the ability of people to remember passphrases accurately over time. You need to remember the word choice, the sentence syntax. You may even forget what the gist of the passphrase was.  
You can create a brainwallet with that as a passphrase, put $20 worth of Bitcoin in it and see how long it last. Or you can wait a year or two and try to write it down before checking. Most likely you will have forgot the comment, forgot this post.

Peter Schiff is correct about what he says about Bitcoin, most of what is criticizes is common misrepresentations of Bitcoin.  
His argument for Bitcoin is that users have the ability to control their own keys and store it basically for free, that is why he argues that ETFs and funds are a waste of fees for the user. The supply does not increase with the price, the price is the result of price speculation and there not being any underlying asset used in any industry that sets the price floor. The the price is not stable for people looking to store their wealth with minimal risk. He mostly objects to notions that Bitcoin is some sort of company, or that it has some price set by something concrete or some sort of earning/revenue, that the tech or influence in Bitcoin is what people get when they buy Bitcoin. Or that Bitcoin is suited as a local currency because of the tax laws, irreversible transactions and price volatility of the transactions even with perfect technical scaling and secure payments.  
In short he says that Bitcoin is a speculative asset with high volatility that people can send without intermediates, and that is what he is personally interested in having some of it. Still makes all his corrections correct. He would never say that Bitcoin is suited as a currency or that it can't be practically banned or that it will not fall in interest and price over time.

Interesting. I am curious to which country it is if that is not private information, I know I keep the country I am in currently private myself.  
I am only familiar with the more intrusive tax laws that require keeping a log of every transaction both to calculate taxes and prevent money laundering. And even the tax free actions in the local currency has to be reported when the amounts are large enough.  
My main issue with taxation on crypto is not the taxes themselves, but the fact that it makes crypto unusable as every transaction is a taxable event, or something that needs to be documented and stored for years. It also makes it so that there is no legal way to remain private since every transaction has to be handed over to the state to comply with tax law if asked for it.

A couple things that is virtually certain about SN if they are alive and mentally fit:  
..1 They would be able to give a proof of existing.  
..2 They are not interested in giving a proof of existing.  
..3 SN is not interested in disproving anyone that claims to be SN.  
or:  
..4 SN actually would like to disprove anyone that claims to be SN, but their rather withhold any proof of existing than do that.  
Anyone in cryptography that uses a alias can and will have methods to prove their existence in case of their digital data being stolen and their accounts being closed down.  
Anyone that says "I created Bitcoin, but I am unable to prove it" is probably lying. And provably lying if SN actually gives proof of existing.

The user says which address they want to send it to, then the wallet selects the inputs that when summed together is enough, and the outputs is the destination address and a change address the wallet controls. That is done in one transaction.  
There is no right way to select the inputs (addresses) that is spent in that one transaction. But a common method is to select the biggest input (in BTC) first, then the second biggest, third biggest and so on. The goal being to use the minimum number of inputs possible to fill the amount for the output.  
Wallets that have coin control lets users select which inputs they want to send, and how much of them they want to send. If a wallet has five inputs, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0,5 BTC in each.  
Then a user using coin control can select the the 0.1 and 0.2 output and send max, two inputs and one output to create another 0.3 input (consolidate) or sending them together in a single 0.3 output to another address. Or just sending the 0.3. It is just personal preference and privacy, which the user selects themselves.

Amazon can't sell it since buying it legally requires real ID that is verified.  
Even if they could sell it directly the issue is that Bitcoin transactions can not be reversed, so someone who steals a credit card would buy Bitcoin, withdraw the Bitcoin, then Amazon would eat the cost.  
Amazon would have to take a premium over what people could get directly on exchanges for it to make sense for them to even sell it without those issues. The reason exchanges is able to operate is because people trade and they get a percent cut of the trading volume.

The SHA256 Hash would be from a message that SN knew by hearth. That message that only SN could have known could be be used as a way to prove their their ID in the future.  
Just as I can prove that I am the author of this comment using this 75debf731d3b081b4653d06157af21c7967007223e1f861e657e8bfc5667d53a even if my account and password get stolen in the future, as long as this message is up and unedited I can prove I wrote it. Sufficiently complex message/data would be impossible to reverse, impossible to prove it was a message, but the person making the hash would always be able to prove they did.  
So barring that SN wanted to be unable to prove their ID, even with plausible deniability, them being now dead or having lost their memories, they would have put in one or more encoded messages in some hash or other cryptographic tool.

The basics is as simple as it gets. You subtract what you paid with what you sold to get the gain that is taxed at some percentage.  
You paid $100 for 1 Bitcoin, you sell it for $500 some years later.  
$500 - $100 = $400 in profit. With 25% taxes you pay $400 x 0.25 = $100 dollars.  
It is the same if you buy 1 Bitcoin for 500 and then later sell it for 100 later, you lost $400 and you get $100 less in taxes instead of paying $100 extra.

Correct, so UBI needs to replace the current welfare system.  
UBI will give a disincentive to those who are not currently on welfare, but it could, as you say, remove even stronger disincentives that are in place with those who already are on welfare.  
The worst disincentive for people who are disabled currently on welfare is that if they try some voluntary or part-time work they risk losing everything and having to start the process over again.

If each person only has one address we can expect the number of addresses that has 1 BTC or more to go down over time, a large part of the growth is that more Bitcoin has been mined, especially in the early days. Wealth tend to be concentrated over time, and that goes for Bitcoin as well.

Nobody knows if the price will rise short term, and they do not know if it will rise long term.  
As long as Bitcoin has a price it will go up and down, but it could have hit its last ATH already, crypto itself could stagnate and shrink and even if it does not there is no way to know if Bitcoin will keep its market share. Anyone that claims to know that the price of Bitcoin will trend upwards is making a bet on it, they may have good reasons to, but they do not know.

POW is secured by the total resources/money it takes to mine it. That results in selling pressure. The selling pressure is the same if it comes from fees or the block reward.  
If Bitcoin requires $1B in mining revenue yearly to be secured it will mean at least $1B in selling pressure yearly even with 0 block reward and only fees.

Assuming no legal regulations against market manipulation:  
It is a classic prisoners dilemma, if the amount of coins are large enough, and all the creditors know that the other creditors know that the first one to sell will sell at a higher price than those who came right after, then there is no option but to sell as soon as possible for everyone or to negotiate it as one OTC trade to a third party where the cash is distributed to the creditors without them having to race each other to the markets.  
Any creditor that thinks price will trends upwards  the next 10 years will sell instantly, then buy back once at once or gradually once the creditor selloff-race is looking to be over.

If every holder magically could only sell 100 bitcoins every day it would force every whale to sell the max they were able to every day, it would be a constant selling pressure which would force even non-whales to sell off as quickly as possible. The price would tank and it would keep on tanking for a long time, nobody would ever want to have more Bitcoin than any potential selling limit.  
There are many historical examples for why this does not work, because the market is based on the investors knowing and trusting that they can sell whenever they want. Whenever trading something is locked for some time the price always crashes worse than it would otherwise once selling is opened again, because who would trust something that can be locked at any time?

What do you plan on using the Bitcoin for? How much Bitcoin do you plan on getting?  
If you plan on securely storing the Bitcoin the easiest and safest would be to get a hardware wallet, that lets you create a wallet offline that you can revive and send Bitcoin from without having to worry about the computer being hacked or the paper-wallet site being fake or the wallet software itself being malware.  
When you store the Bitcoin you keep a list of words, 12-24 seed words which is used to generate a lot of addresses and keys that you can use to spend it. As long as you, and only you, have the seed the Bitcoin is safe. The safest method is generating the seed and writing it down physically without it ever being on a computer, and to do that you need some device like a hardware wallet.  
If you plan on having small amounts and use them fast you can use some Bitcoin wallet software that makes new addresses for you automatically. But any Bitcoin that is generated on or managed on a standard computer connected to the internet is only as safe as the computer it is on.  
All that is needed to send Bitcoin is the destination address, and by giving out one of the addresses you control the key you are able to get Bitcoin sent to you.

The price and amount of the coins when they were mined is an upper estimation of the amount of capital that has been spent on Bitcoin. Close to the cost of mining historically at least.

The US does not censor books that has non-factual information, that is what freedom of speech is for.  
There is no book that is so wacky about legal theory that the state will make it illegal to posses, read or distribute. 1 amendment.  
There is discussion on which books should be in public libraries and in school curriculum, but that is something different.  
The reason that people get refunds following the CTC method is because when they declare that they have zero income they get the refund right away, then they make their testimonial, then later some of them is challenged later and get convicted. Not all of them, not right away, but some and after some time, including the author.  
Maybe CTC has some way to get a refund now, but there is no way for the people to know for certain that they will not get railroaded themselves in the future.  
Obviously if there is a TBTB that got the author unjustly, it can get any of the other people who use the same method as the author. Even real illegal tax-evasion is a gamble that not everyone will be caught doing, and those who are only after some time, and even then it depends on it becomes a criminal case that ends up on justicegov.  
But what the case did illustrate was that it is possible to get a refund, and then 6-7 years later be convicted for that same refund.
