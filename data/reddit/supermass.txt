It's true. If you want, you could say there are only 2.1 Million DecaBitcoins. It's an arbitrary element of the currency.

OP is not the only buyer. The whole point of a free market is it's free. Fair is a matter of perspective, and if someone has a particular set of needs or lack of interest in overcomplicating their day, they might pay that premium the same way you pay for a consultants time or whatever. If he's set the price too high, he suffers but he's obviously not interested in a price that is less, and that is his right. He has valued his coins and appraised the state of the market himself. Maybe he's waiting for that price to become attractive. Perhaps it's not fair from your perspective, but that's not what fair is. "Fair" is abstract, and is determined by the parties of a real transaction.

The simple answer is this:
Litecoin is the logical hedge for Bitcoin. It's not a necessary investment, but it is prudent.
Bitcoin uses SHA-256 for encryption and Litecoin uses SCRYPT. If someone were to crack SHA tomorrow (*highly unlikely*), it would cause Bitcoin's price to drop - at least temporarily - and Litecoin would likely shoot up because its encryption would be intact. This is much easier and cheaper for people pulling out of Bitcoin than trying to get into an exchange and withdraw out into fiat. 
The reason they'd choose Litecoin over other currencies is because it is the most popular Bitcoin clone. Because it is so closely based on Bitcoin, much less blind trust must be placed in the protocol by people who already believed in the fundamentals of Bitcoin (however, have lost faith in the encryption method). In a panic, it is the most logical decision because it has the least risk involved.

Exactly. If something more attractive than Bitcoin emerges, it would take years for it to start denting the Bitcoin marketshare, and in that time Bitcoin could just adapt the more attractive features. The cryptocurrency war is over before it began. There's too much capital and business in Bitcoin now.

1. Bitcoin is a protocol, not a consumer protection agency. It enables fast, secure, un-blockable transactions between consenting parties. That being said, Bitcoin naturally protects the seller, but not the buyer -- and this is how it must be. You want to have the trust of merchants in order to facilitate a market. Buyers will need to research their merchants during these early days and make sure they aren't being scammed. Eventually, comprehensive consumer protections will emerge - various forms of escrow, ratings, etc - but these must be built and maintained by people. That means entrepreneurs, capital, and time. Technology alone can't solve the problem of nefarious intentions.
2. Nothing stops people from hoarding Bitcoin. We know that wealth that sits around doing nothing is useless to everyone, and one school of thought suggests that people will re-invest excessive wealth. Another, more pro-active perspective might understand that solving the problem of hoarding is simply a matter of system design. Incentives. If you can conceive of more effective, inventive ways to engage that money, you can coax that money into different financial instruments. Bitcoin makes the barrier for entry into other markets much lower... things like commodities, stocks, bonds, options, charities, etc. Getting your Bitcoin involved in markets like these is almost trivially easy compared to traditional currencies. That being said, if you're worried about distribution of wealth right now, the underlying question is, what is more important -- fairness, or freedom? This is a philosophical question, and you can debate it or you can seize your freedom as it is presented to you and trust that any sane human will do the same when it is presented to them too. All who reach out will prosper. If you wish, you may take your appreciated Bitcoin and reinvest a portion of them in pro-human causes one day.
3. Bitcoin *is* money. It's also a protocol. It's also a fundamental component of a true democracy, and this is its real value. It's decentralized. Nobody ever claimed Bitcoin would lead to a resource-based economy... it could be a stepping stone along the way, though.
4. Nobody knows. Very possibly, nobody will ever know. Give up speculating.

Honestly, this looks just fine and the only way to possibly find fault with it is to have an attachment to something else. I love it.
I'll be living in NYC (again) this time next month so I'd love to grab one of these guys in person when they're ready! I am so sold.

SHA will be cracked eventually.
LTC *may* suffer a 51% attack and fork, however there have been hard forks in the past and there will be more in the future. Would it survive? Most likely. Recover? Depends on the fork. This isn't just Litecoin's weakness. What if Bitcoin has to hard fork for a de-anonymizing update to satisfy regulators?
What BTC will do and what BTC is currently capable of are two different things. It's great you're enthusiastic, but it doesn't sound like you're being skeptical enough.
@_date: 2013-07-03 03:39:13
The price is collapsing because the people artificially propping up the market are selling high while they can to drive it one last time toward the *rapidly* rising true value. The pump and dump before the storm.

You act as if this is a matter the people on this subreddit have any control over...
@_date: 2013-06-25 19:47:00
This would take time. In the interim, Bitcoin would suffer and Litecoin would benefit. This is historically evident by a cursory reading of the charts, and the relationship between BTC and LTC prices.

Don't worry, he clearly has no idea how many payment solutions are coming. It's called startup investment, son, and Bitcoin-related projects just got a lot of it. But businesses take a little time to... start up.

I didn't think I implied it was un-hackable? Certainly, there will be security issues that develop and are corrected over the course of its lifetime.
I mean, I'm the first to admit Bitcoin is far from perfect. I agree its security is impressive. I also believe that it does need an extra layer offering the security of institutions who take on additional security roles for a fee, to accomodate the mainstream precisely because there will be vulnerabilities. Banks that hold and insure Bitcoins must emerge for critical-mass in the banked-world, where people are used to a certain relationship and experience surrounding their money. This allows for choice, which accommodates a larger economy, beyond market anarchists and speculators. Seems like an inevitability.

Difficulty increases after a set number of blocks. They could only mine 2016 blocks before the difficulty would spike.

Exactly. 
These are people who understand the technology has not changed, and are interested in the future of online payments and currency. There are also those who have been paying attention to Bitcoin for more than a couple months who have seen this all before... several times. [Bitcoin only goes one way in the long term](

It would take a while to go from finding a vulnerability in SHA to being able to crack target wallets. I'm not saying the core dev team won't immediately mobilize to fix it, and prevent any real damage. That doesn't change the fact that the week following that news would be a rollercoaster for BTC prices and a boost for LTC. There's what we want to be true, and then there's what happens in markets. They react to things like that.
