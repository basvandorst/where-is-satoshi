12 words seeds (based on the 2048 words dictionary) are similar to 128 bits keys. 
24 words is similar to a 256 bits key. 
The danger of splitting without redundancy is that you can’t lose either piece!

So... to use a common analogy, an address is like a PO Box. It’s a number where your can store coins. Each address (PO box) has a key to open it: that’s the private key in Bitcoin. 
Now, a “wallet” is usually a collection of addresses, or a collection of PO Boxes and associates keys. 
Bitcoins don’t come in common fractions like $: $5, $1, $0.25, etc... A BTC “coin” can be 1.25373 BTC or 0.00003422 BTC. So each address in your wallet contains one or more of these coins.
Instead of keeping track of all addresses and keys, a seed, which is a collection of 12 or 24 words can do that for you: all PO Boxes and their keys can be derived (computed) from the seed. This way, you only have to keep the seed secret, instead of storing all the addresses and private keys. 
Hope this helps.

I think your idea makes sense. You can generate the first addresses using the website you mentioned (look at Derived addresses). Then check on a block explorer. Any address that shows a balance will indicate the correct seed.

Interesting, but he keeps referencing that the trend is backed by data. Which data exactly? Genuinely curious.

The book is FREE until Sunday on Amazon!

OK, so let's say I learned a lot...
You need to edit everything in Word or similar, and then you need to use Amazon's own software,  Kindle Create, to prepare your book for publishing as an ebook. So I made the rookie mistake of correcting the last typos directly in Create.. Problem is: you cannot export back to Word or anything else! Quite a pain in the b..., because you have to look for corrections manually and copy/paste back to Word, but Create doesn't copy ANY formatting, so it's a real mess...
Anyway, the rest of the process is quite straightforward. You need a decent cover for your book. Fiverr is your friend but don't take the super cheap options imo. Then Amazon lets you write the blurb, pick keywords, and the pricing plan, etc... All pretty easy, honestly.
Hope this helps.

ha ha ha! I know! Is that a good title? ;-)

Most books contain between 2,000 and 10,000 words, let’s say 5,000 on average. So there are about 5 billion sentences in a set of 1 million books. 
That’s about the same security as having only 3 BIP39 words.

Others have already pointed a few inaccuracies. I would just add that the general form of a transaction is less “I want to send 1 BTC to X” and closer to “I want to unlock the funds in A, B and C, move them to X and T and lock them there.” 
There are several types of locking / unlocking mechanisms (signature, multisig, script hash...). 
The thing is that, even for a “simple” receiving address X, most transactions wouldn’t even reveal X itself, but rather a hash (a coded version) of X.

The reorganized chain would start just before the block with the fraudulent transaction, effectively removing all blocks that were mined on top of this one. So the fees included in these blocks would be cancelled (more precisely, it would look like these blocks were never mined in the first place).

Checkpoints have been removed from
Bitcoin, the last one was set in 2014. They were creating confusion regarding the security model and shifting power toward the developers who could chose which chain was correct, going against the decentralized nature of POW. If POW works as a security model, then checkpoints are unnecessary.

It’s a good question. One problem is that there is no real incentive for the miners participating in a rollback to include the “lost” transactions. There might be incoming transactions with better fees that they might want to include instead.

I don’t think this would be a good solution, as others have already mentioned, but it raises an interesting point: what does “stealing” mean in the bitcoin network?
The “owner” of a Bitcoin address is the person or group of persons who knows the private key corresponding to that address. If the hackers of Binance have managed to get the private keys to a cold storage of the exchange, they become, in fact, the owners of these funds. Yes, they acted fraudulently to access these keys, but they can’t be banned or blacklisted because in Bitcoin, knowledge IS ownership,

Yes, I had understood you’re idea. What I was trying to say is that, I’m the absence of a central authority, the only credible source of “truth” is the blockchain itself. If you start adding “notes” about which transactions are ok and which are not, you might end up invalidating the whole “sovereignty” of the blockchain.

I understand your frustration but I believe it’s still interesting to understand the many reasons why this CAN’T happen indeed.
