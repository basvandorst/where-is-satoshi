Just wanted to chime in and confirm a relatively smooth transaction so others can feel a bit safer for their potential first purchase. I bought the game "PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds" for Steam for what I think is a pretty good price (at the time of writing 19.91 US$). I payed with a plain old non-Lightning transaction.
The order process is pretty straightforward. You enter an e-mail address for serial number delivery, checkout, pay. No other details required. Confirmation of 1 block took a couple of minutes. I left Joltfun open in a tab so once the transaction was confirmed with 1 block I saw the order status switching to "Fetching the keys ...", that took another 5 or so minutes after which a working Steam key for my game was both delivered via e-mail and displayed on the Joltfun page I left open.
I found the 5-minute delay during "Fetching the keys ..." a bit suspicious. It practically implies there's more going on behind the scenes than just a database query to get a pre-purchased stored serial number already owned by Joltfun. Pure speculation on my part for sure but it feels like the service takes your Bitcoin or Bitcoin equivalent in fiat *and then* acquires a key for you via its own internal channels either in an automated or semi-automated way, hence a few minutes delay before it can actually present you with a key.
Anyway, got a key, it activated just fine on Steam, so there's that. You may want to at least keep the "Fetching the keys ..." delay in mind when you purchase someting yourself.
