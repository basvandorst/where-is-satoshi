 I don't think there exist any competition between Dogecoin and bitcoin. Bitcoin is master of all cryptocurrencies and others are just complementary to it. Whether take spread or awareness or real use, bitcoin beat all others coins.   
However, there exist one glitch and that is fees. If bitcoin couldn't able to solve fees issue soon then dogecoin may overtook it as its fees is too low.
