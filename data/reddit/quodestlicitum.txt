I haven't been outside during the day. But I would say it's not worth coming down to see what's going on outside. I think the protestors packed up and left because the judge was threatening to anonymize the jury which could have hurt Ross's case.
It is worth coming down to check out the trial though, in my opinion.
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:15:38
Cool, thanks. Hopefully more news organizations will share the rest.

No, I'm saying you might be held responsible if you run a normal website and your customers start selling illegal things. That's the whole point of creating "bad law". The individual circumstances of the case are lost but the precedent remains.
But aside from all that, it's an interesting case to follow, regardless of whether you are political about it or not. Personally, it's not political for me. But I do think there are interesting issues raised by it.

The whole jury selection thing was kind of interesting. It is a random process, basically a lottery. The judge's right hand man (this person probably has an official name, but I don't know what it is) selects numbers from a lottery wheel thing, and they fill up 16 seats in the jury box, 12 regular jurors and 4 alternates. There are maybe another 40-50 jurors who are not selected sitting in the court room, and who will be selected by lottery to fill in for jurors who are struck. All jurors fill out a questionnaire with questions like: "Is there any reason you can't be impartial in this trial?" or "Do you have any view for or against the government that would influence your decision in this trial?". There were also quite a few questions trying to get at jurors who might believe in jury nullification (there are protesters outside handing out literature on jury nullification).
Then, in 6 rounds, each side gets to strike sitting jurors. Sometimes these strikes overlap, so maybe only 2 or 3 people will leave the jury box per round. The judge mentioned at the beginning that strikes were "use it or lose it", so you had to use your strikes each round; they couldn't be rolled over.
Anyway, I just thought that would be interesting background on jury selection. To your question, by the time opening statements were over, and the first witness was called, everyone in the courtroom looked tired, including the jury. I sometimes thought numerous jurors were sleeping, however their tv screens are angled up from the ground, so I just think it looked like that from a distance. In general, I would say the jury was pretty low energy by the end of the day, so I don't feel like I had a good read one way or another. They seemed pretty bored during the first witness testimony, which was "Cirrus" aka Homeland Security agent guy.

no, real trials don't resemble hollywood trials, so i wasn't thinking that. although i think this story will probably become a movie at some point.
@_date: 2015-01-16 08:42:36
The Greenberg article was mentioned. It was kind of funny, because Greenberg was in the courtroom.
So I took note that a search warrant for Karpeles' email was issued August 15, 2013. Dratel has an email from DerYaghiayan stating that the Greenberg article where DPR is quoted "sounds a lot like Karpeles". DY noted that Karpeles tended to speak in the plural first person, possibly as a result of English not being his native language.
I believe that prior to the search warrants, Karpeles was not aware of any government investigation. It was the warrants for his email that tipped him off that the government was after him. Therefore, I have to assume that his meeting with Baltimore HSI took place after the Greenberg article. Unfortunately, the evidence is hard to see even when projected on the screen. However, they are projecting emails from DY, so I'm guessing that this is well documented somewhere, and this information could be obtained if you were looking for it during the trial (re: a specific date for the meeting). It may have even been said explicitly, but I don't see it in my notes.

Here is my proposal for ordering today's transcript. Feedback welcome:
@_date: 2015-01-14 01:08:05
It definitely skews older. I guess you'd have to be specific about what you mean by "old", but I'd say they are mostly in the 40-60 range. I noticed that anyone who had scientific or computer science expertise was struck from the jury pretty fast. My guess is that the prosecution doesn't want a know it all influencing the rest of the jurors. However, the jury strikes are not made public, so it's anyone's guess as to what side drove those strikes.
@_date: 2015-01-21 03:30:14
I actually think it's not that far fetched. It wouldn't surprise me if Karpeles had a hand in Silk Road. It might be far fetched that he was some Svengali that manipulated markets, etc, but I wouldn't be that surprised if he gave the Feds the Silk Road website in return for not prosecuting him for other things. Law enforcement cuts these kinds of deals ALL THE TIME.

FYI regarding the earlier discussion. Because we are a third party ordering the transcripts, and they are being produced for the main parties in the case already, it appears that the price will be $1.20 per page. Again, until we have ordered the transcript and it has been fulfilled at $1.20 per page, I hesitate to say this for sure. However, all indications from the court transcript office point to this being the case.
@_date: 2015-01-22 16:47:55
I will. but we have to put together the scratch to do it. Unfortunately, the transcripts don't come cheap if you want them during the trial. You can donate at the link below if you want to get Days 1-4.
@_date: 2015-01-23 02:14:05
How am I having it both ways? You mentioned that the newspapers won't want to share, because of "scoops". I'm saying that the purpose of the transcript is not for "scoops", but to do more in-depth research and less sensationalist puff pieces. By releasing it publicly, you may elicit feedback from people familiar with the technical or personal details of the case who will make your reporting better. I'm really not clear on how forcing everyone to pay $300 for the same public document is enhancing your reporting. It's not like your competitors can't order it.
@_date: 2015-01-23 00:00:26
Thanks for picking up the AMA mantle for this trial and adding another transcript to the mix. Are you planning on purchasing any other transcripts in the future?
Also, what is your take on the defense strategy in this trial? Was Dratel way too optimistic that he would be able to push the Karpeles story? The chat log with Variety Jones seems devastating to that narrative, and if you're Ulbricht and Dratel planning this defense, don't you have to see that coming? If that was all they had, why are they still fighting this thing? Maybe the government's plea offer was stay in prison till you're 80?
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:28:42
I think the combination of him naming Karpeles, and the government seemingly crapping themselves simultaneously had a lot of people talking in the courtroom. Especially the reporters and people who know who Karpeles is, and his background/history. Let's be honest, whether it's true or not, it's a damn good story. The most compelling thing is that this is the government's own witness talking about being undermined by his own agency, and his investigation derailed because another branch of his agency was making what looked like a deal with Karpeles. The prosecution was successful in shutting down the questioning for now, but the tradeoff is the jury now gets 4 days to think about that last 20 minutes of craziness on Thursday.

I need to do some more research. I think that eventually the full trial transcript will hit the docket, at which point it will be $.10 per page from PACER. However, I am not certain of that, and don't know when the transcript would hit the docket, assuming it does.
Right now, we can get nightly copies of the transcript electronically for $1.20 a page. I don't know whether it is text searchable or not, but I would be willing to run OCR on the PDF as part of managing this. It would probably make it "good enough" searchable, and others could clean it up as they see fit. It is possible they will send an already searchable copy, but i kind of doubt it.

I didn't feel like writing a huge writeup, so I just decided to do an AMA if anyone wants to ask for specifics. Here is some elaboration on what was posted below.
During the day of the sting, the Feds started an online chat with Ross when he was at the library (this was with Cirrus, who is actually a Homeland Security agent based at the Chicago airport). Then the feds prevented Ross from closing his computer, and were able to show that the chat they were having from the Cirrus end was also showing on Ross's end of the computer. So that looks pretty bad for Ross. They also have a diary from his computer where Ross details his experiences creating/running the site. This all points to DPR === Ross.
His defense attorney began with a pretty shocking opening statement. Yes, Ross initially created Silk Road. Yes, Ross was caught in the library on Silk Road. But what REALLY happened is that Ross had ambitions to open a general purpose website for purchasing anything, and it was only after he handed off control to a third party that the whole "drug bazaar" thing really kicked into high gear.
Although this was only hinted at in the opening statement, Ross's lawyer suggested that the "real" DPR was able to transfer a huge load of incriminating files onto Ross's computer (the diary, financial logs, etc) as a way to frame Ross and take suspicion off himself. He mentioned that Ross was running BitTorrent on the clearnet from his computer, thus suggesting this might have been a possible attack vector for loading the incriminating files onto Ross's computer. Dratel (Ross's lawyer) pointed to all the idiotic things Ross did as proof that he couldn't be DPR, because DPR was known for being meticulous about security.
@_date: 2015-01-23 01:15:51
The transcript gets released around 8-9PM. Every reporter in that trial has generally released their story by that time. Any "scoops" that were to be had have already been had. So I don't really see the problem with buying it together and sharing it as a way of doing follow up stories and perhaps allowing for more in depth reporting than typically happens with these things.
@_date: 2015-01-16 20:01:47
I don't know the exact timeline. Dratel mentioned that the government had given them a document dump relatively close to trial. The judge wasn't that sympathetic though and said they had time to prepare. I think this was to show they hadn't had time to give notice to the prosecution of the hearsay exception.
@_date: 2015-01-23 05:08:47
I think Dratel's lack of computer know-how is a weakness for the defense. The prosecution has been all over him since he pulled out the Karpeles thing, and he doesn't know how to adapt to prosecution objections when it comes to technical matters. He doesn't understand the tech himself, so he tries to ram home the same point using slightly different language, and it just never works. This is a good example.
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:38:08

@_date: 2015-01-16 02:05:41
The jury, as did everyone in the courtroom, sensed that this was not something the prosecution was happy about. I think it had an impact, but it's hard to say how much. A lot of the discussion in the aftermath of this happened away from the jury, so the defense and prosecution could argue about what will be allowed.
@_date: 2015-01-16 19:59:33
Is the transcript available to people not involved with the case during the trial? I think it varies by district, and I don't know the rules for SDNY.
@_date: 2015-01-16 06:10:48
Dratel strikes me as a very intelligent attorney. I don't think he would make a straw man argument that could simply be dismissed out of hand. He must think this is plausible, otherwise the prosecution will tear it apart on redirect.
@_date: 2015-01-16 05:31:07
I came to the trial as someone interested in the drug war and issues of criminal justice. From what I read in the media, it seemed likely that Ulbricht would be convicted.
Personally, I don't think we should be sending people to prison for life for drug offenses. I'd prefer we legalize drugs and put the money into helping people get treatment and staying off drugs. If they decide to abuse drugs anyway, then at least they are safe drugs and they aren't sharing needles and dying of rat poison. If people abuse their privileges and commit crimes or harm others while on drugs, then send them to jail, no question.
I'm not sure I was rooting for one side or another. From what I've read about Ulbricht, it seems a waste to send this person to jail for the rest of their life. On the other hand, if he really did run a narcotics conspiracy where he tried to have people murdered, I think he should do time for that.
I suppose I am skeptical of the competence of government, so when I start seeing cracks in their case, I tend to believe maybe more readily than others. However, on balance, I think I'm relatively objective, and able to be persuaded by both sides. I feel like I would be a decent proxy for a juror, albeit a very technically sophisticated one.
@_date: 2015-01-17 15:54:27
He explained how he had built the online identity of Cirrus and how he had communicated with various online personas in order to capture drugs and arrest Silk Road dealers. He was also involved in the bust of DPR at the library in San Francisco.
@_date: 2015-01-22 00:11:42
There's a concern that this case will be used to create bad law in the future. Specifically, personal criminal liability for webmasters for the actions of users on their website. Clearly there are unique facts around Silk Road specifically, but the general precedent may be used more expansively in the future.
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:33:57
It wasn't that full. If you're there by 9am, you'll probably definitely get in.
@_date: 2015-01-16 16:17:52
There are two AUSA's running the case. Serrin Turner and Timothy Howard.
Both went to Harvard Law. They're clearly both very smart. If I had to guess I'd say both are mid-30's to early 40's in age.
Howard gave the prosecution's opening statement, and so far Turner has examined the first witness and laid out the facts of the government's case.
I don't think either is a lightweight. However, Dratel may have age/experience on them. It seems to me they were not prepared for this whole dive into the Baltimore evidence with their own witness. That was clear on Thursday when Turner was struggling to come up with a valid argument to keep out parts of the witness testimony and limit Dratel's cross.
@_date: 2015-01-14 01:48:48
When Dratel brought up the framing of Ross in the library, this was the only time that Ross appeared to get emotional and start crying a little. My initial reaction was that this is perhaps evidence that the story may be at least partly true, but then again it may just be coaching from the defense to seem sympathetic.
@_date: 2015-01-16 05:33:52
Ulbricht's attorney is saying that it was a "free market experiment" (Ulbricht's words) that became too much for him to manage. That he wasn't trying to start a drug bazaar per se. That kicked into high gear once the new DPR took over. Not clear how provable that is in relation to Ulbricht's involvement.
@_date: 2015-01-22 16:42:46
Of course. For me, this isn't about that. I just think the details of the trial are interesting, and I don't have time to appear in person in court, so this seemed like an interesting way to follow along with what is happening.
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:55:56
I think one of the reasons the prosecution flipped out is that the whole Baltimore Homeland Security/Karpeles thing seemed shady. The Homeland Security officer from Chicago was testifying that he asked them not to interview Karpeles, and that they did anyway. Then, Baltimore offered up DPR courtesy of Karpeles. It smells of government turf war/railroading.
It's not clear how much of this actually happened. But the important part is that the Chicago Homeland Security Investigator thinks it happened. It starts throwing into question the motives of the government and their honesty, which isn't good for the prosecution.
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:51:40
that was my assumption. again, this hasn't been researched, it's just what i have in my notes from trial.
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:23:42
They also did their best to kick of technical or scientific people from the jury. Since the jury strikes are secret, I don't think we know who was kicked off by which side (although maybe the transcripts will show this perhaps). Regardless, it does seem that intelligence and critical thinking are not prized assets on a jury of one's peers.

yeah, it might get nuts. my jaw was definitely on the floor today.
@_date: 2015-01-21 04:31:03
We would get them nightly. I imagine a few hours after the trial concludes each night.
We would receive them electronically. I imagine PDF. I will have to check on if it comes text searchable, but even if not, it is easy enough to OCR.
I think the main question right now is how to do we go about soliciting interest? Maybe a crowdfunding page?
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:54:05
Nope, nobody seemed into doing this again. Perhaps my fault, it ended up being a lot more expensive than I originally thought ($300 for yesterday's transcript versus around $80 [initial estimate]). We got around $230 from the changetip campaign and I still had to come $70 out of pocket :(
The DailyDot released the Day 4 and 5 transcript here:
I don't know what their source for the doc was for Day 5 (whether it was from our campaign or their own purchase). The author of that article mentioned on Twitter that it's expensive to get the transcripts, so they are being released slowly. It seems like the various news outlets should get together and purchase a copy and share it between themselves and the world.

I imagine this trial might also be bankrupting the parents. It sounds like they were living the good life abroad before this. A fair amount of collateral damage from his economic experiment.
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:13:43
Yeah, he's likeable and very competent. He kicked ass supremely today. His delivery is low key but effective. He had the prosecutors, who are much younger than him, running around in circles by the end of the day. It is yet to be seen whether he can bring it home for Ulbricht, but so far I'd say he's earning his pay big time.
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:36:27
Dratel's theory of the case is that Karpeles and Barr were running the site as a way to juice the market for Bitcoin, and when they saw that the Feds were about to come down on them, they lured Ulbricht back to be on the site as DPR and then fed them Ross.
@_date: 2015-01-22 05:06:14
no, but you can use changetip if you want
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:42:44
They both had presence, but in different ways. Howard's style was more oratorical. When he first stated the charges and mentioned Ulbricht's name, he dramatically pointed at Ross and said "THAT MAN!, Ross Ulbricht". To which Ross began shaking his head "No" repeatedly. Howard's style was of the polished debater who line by line was constructing a meticulous argument.
Dratel had a more understated tone. He spoke a bit more slowly, and paused more frequently. My feeling was that his style was more "matter of fact". However, this has it's own effectiveness. His flatter style made Howard seem like a bit of a drama queen in comparison.
Dratel from the start conceded the "outline" of the state's case by saying that Ulbricht did create Silk Road, and that Ulbricht was in the library on Silk Road when apprehended. And that neither of those things necessarily implicate Ulbricht in the crimes alleged by the state. 
This is obviously a high stakes way to play it. Dratel is essentially presenting an affirmative defense, because the facts as they stand look bad for his client. So now he is proposing that the middle of the story, the part where all the bad stuff happens, is in fact all the doings of someone else. If successful, this breaks the narrative arc of the prosecution, but if underwhelming, perhaps serves only to reinforce the state's case. After all, he appears in Acts 1 and 3, but was absent for all of Act 2?
@_date: 2015-01-14 01:19:17
Ross's lawyer suggested that during the September before Ross's arrest, the real DPR received intelligence suggesting that a bust of Silk Road was imminent. I think this might have been related to the bust of another Dark Net market that went down around this time, but I'm not up to speed on that to say one way or another.
Anyway, yes, basically that DPR's exit plan was to frame Ross and run away with most of the Bitcoins. Dratel mentioned a couple times that the profits Ross had on his computer (approx. $18M worth of Bitcoin) was a pittance compared to what was made through the site. He suggests that the balance is with the real DPR, who is still at large.
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:23:26
"That may be hard as the large customer activity makes a great place to hide his own activity."
That's Dratel's entire point I think. This is the perfect companion to your Bitcoin exchange business. You are daily cashing out a bunch of customers, who are all turning Bitcoin into cash, and therefore you have a reason to be funneling massive amounts of Bitcoin into cash. So Karpeles could have used Gox as a way to cash out his illegal gains from Silk Road without attracting LE suspicion.
@_date: 2015-01-24 05:36:50
I was sitting on the left side of the court for days 1 and 3. I'll come say hi at some point if you're going to be there for the rest of the trial. I don't have the time to come every day but I'll probably be there intermittently.
You think there are any more bombshells to come, like day 3, or did Dratel already fire all his guns?
@_date: 2015-01-21 05:51:53
More like 10 - 3 for the prosecution today. Dratel was able to get to an approximation of the place he was at yesterday with the witness, prior to being shut down by the defense, but with much reduced effect. I think it must have been confusing for the jury, because it was tredding over old ground, just with "objection" thrown in every 2 seconds.
@_date: 2015-01-24 05:43:56
Yeah, but there is no substitute for knowing it yourself. I think a lot of the things Dratel is asking about are probably a result of the computer expert's analysis, but when he has to adapt on the fly he seems to come up empty.
@_date: 2015-01-21 05:47:57
Basically, the defense was objecting to almost every question posed by the prosecution to the witness. Just as the prosecution had objected to almost every question posed to the witness all day. Usually, there is some leeway given in the way a question is posed, in order to make it understandable to the jury and not speak in "legalese" the whole time. However, neither side was giving the other any slack today.
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:54:34
I think they were majorly off balance. When your own witness starts talking about how he thought the main suspect in the case was someone else, someone who is a legit computer hacker and security expert, who is known for being meticulous and paranoid, that's not a good day for your case. Especially when that someone isn't in the defendant's chair. And how the government might have continued an investigation into that individual, except for, you know, government fuckupery and turfwars. The idea that Ulbricht was the sacrificial lamb starts to actually seem plausible.
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:09:13
Yes. My notes on this aren't the best, but DerYaghiayan testified that silkroadmarket.org had a change in hosting registration at around the time the defense alleges ulbricht turned it over to karpeles (early 2012?). I believe that the registrar was xta.net, which was the registrar for silk road. xta.net was also the registrar for mutem sigellum, karpeles' holding company, and i think some of his sub companies as well.
@_date: 2015-01-21 16:33:59
Yes, the jury must agree unanimously. If not, it is a mistrial and they start with a new trial and new jury.
@_date: 2015-01-16 07:54:12
Baltimore HSI - Homeland Security Investigations.
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:25:29
The truth is I have no idea. But for purposes of the trial, whether I believe it is actually Mark Karpeles or not, isn't relevant. The defense is doing an excellent job of introducing reasonable doubt.
Keep in mind, the defense didn't mention Mark Karpeles in their opening statement. Dratel was able to get all this information out of the government's own witness on cross-examination. The government's own witness thought Karpeles was the invisible hand behind silk road, and that ashley barr was dpr. 
Dratel asked Agent DerYaghiayan about information they had subpoenaed from Dwolla, and whether Ulbricht and Karpeles had moved money. Ulbricht had moved a few thousand dollars over 2 years. On the other hand, there was a firehose of money coming from Mt. Gox through Dwolla. Mutem Sigellum (Karepeles' holding company) had a transaction list 1000 pages long.
@_date: 2015-01-16 08:48:02
So I found something else in my notes.
Summer 2013 - HSI Baltimore working on getting an interview with Karpeles. HSI Chicago requests that they don't.
July 11, 2103 - Karpeles attorney's bring up silk road with the government. mention that he would get a walk on all charges. (I don't know if this is the official meeting with Karpeles and attorneys or not).
There is a specific email from DY where he lays out that he is upset with HSI Baltimore for messing with his investigation. He provides a chronology of what occurred and problems he was having with Baltimore. In this same email, there is mention Karpeles' lawyers had made an offer and that Karpeles hadn't been charged. I guess they had done civil asset forfeiture on his assets.
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:32:35
There was a quick discussion about this. Basically, he had broken it the night before while eating dinner, and was trying to figure out what to do. There were no good options, so he got it taken care of first thing the next morning, which delayed court for a bit but was perhaps the best option. Presumably he wouldn't have been able to present that day if he hadn't gotten it fixed.
@_date: 2015-01-22 16:24:57
This is an interesting trial to follow, regardless of your views on his guilt or innocence. I think anyone could have told you that his chances for a not guilty verdict were slim going into this thing, so you're not telling anyone anything they don't already know. I guess I'm missing your point?
@_date: 2015-01-26 23:43:35
First, we shouldn't assume it was the government who wanted the educated people off the jury. This case involves technical issues, and the defense might also feel threatened by sophisticated people who will sway the jury based on technical analysis of the evidence.
As for the courts, Federal judges are appointed for life. They can't be fired or have their salary reduced except for gross misconduct. So theoretically, they are impartial. While you might take issue with the politics of some of these judges, in theory they are not corrupt individuals.
The truth is, I think it is our fault. We have ceded our political system to a two party duopoly that doesn't really differ in their fundamental approach to these things. We're too busy eating nachos and watching Desperate Housewives to give a fuck what is happening in our government. That is why this shit stays the same. I don't think it's the justice system per se. It is the failure of our society to define a collective vision for itself besides that of narcissism and self-enrichment. The rest follows from these broken principles.
DPR (Ulbricht?)'s conduct might be a microcosm of this, in a way. If it's true that Ulbricht decided to start hiring hit men to protect his drug empire, then Silk Road was never really about reducing the "coercion" of the state. It just became another corrupt organization intent on self-enrichment and getting yours. It's these principles that are eating away at our society, not the justice system per se.

Yeah it seems absurd. What if you are indigent or self-represented?
Seems to me like further privatization of the commons. Why can't we just pay the court reporter a decent salary and not have to charge insane fees for transcripts?
I talked with the court reporter a little bit the other day, and he said that 90% of people who try to become court reporters drop out. He can do 280 words a minute on that machine he has. Sounds like a tough job and they deserve to be paid well. But that should happen by fully funding the courts, not by pushing the costs off to the parties. It's not like the court transcript is optional in a trial.

The jury only has what has been told to them. The prosecution began their direct of DerYaghiayan with a brief tutorial of how Tor / Public key encryption work. During that time, the jury looked kind of bored. DerYaghiayan had put together some videos to demonstrate these concepts.
However, today didn't rely that heavily on technical stuff. Dratel dug into private and public keys a little, but only to point out that a private key is not specific to any one person. It can be stolen, used by many people, etc. All you need is the text of the key.
The rest of the time he was building to the big reveal, which was Karpeles.
@_date: 2015-01-22 02:22:35
I can post a PDF. Where do you want it uploaded?
@_date: 2015-01-16 05:07:42
There are two main issues that the prosecution was objecting to. 
The first was that DerYaghiayan was testifying to the "fact" of the arrangement between Karpeles and Baltimore Homeland Security, when he had heard through a chain of one to two people at Homeland Security. So the prosecution is arguing that anything related to the investigation in Baltimore of Karpeles is hearsay.
The second was more confusing, and I think the judge was confused by their argument as well. When Dratel started discussing Bitcointalk.org, and how DerYaghiayan had found that the software on that website was the same as the software powering Silk Road's forums, the prosecution objected, and there was a pretty long sidebar with the judge at that point, which led to the judge calling an end to the trial for the day and having the jury led out. This was so they could have a discussion in open court about the issues.
The prosecution argued that DerYaghiayan shouldn't be allowed to testify regarding the emails he wrote regarding Baltimore, because much of that information was hearsay regarding what was happening in Baltimore. Dratel objected that under Rule 807 ( his testimony would be allowed,  because he reasonably believed it to be true at the time (and he is also their witness, and an agent of the government, which doesn't hurt his credibility). The judge decided to give the prosecution the weekend to file objections, because the defense is supposed to provide notice of the use of rule 807 in advance. They are both to file written briefs to the court on the issue.
As to the Bitcointalk.org issue, the prosecution wasn't making a lot of sense. They tried to say that DerYaghiayan shouldn't be allowed to testify about the forum software because I guess maybe he wasn't the one who had actually done the analysis of the software itself? It really wasn't clear, and at some point the judge was actually getting close to mocking the prosecution over their nonsensical arguments. There was a whole back and forth where Judge Forrest was trying to get the prosecution to admit that this testimony was the same as the testimony he'd been giving the prosecution all day. The government clearly seemed stuck, and I think is worried that Dratel is about to bring the curtains down on their case. Basically, unless they get super creative, they are going to lose on this issue, which was the vibe the Judge was putting out.
*Note: edited to replace Turner for Judge Forrest in final paragraph. "Forest was trying to get the prosecution to admit"

The objective answer is that this is a matter of perspective. I know that some people viewing the trial see it through the lens of the state as oppressor, and the judge/prosecutor being on the same team. If this is your view, then what happened today looked an awful lot like the judge excusing a lot of mistakes by the prosecution and penalizing the defense instead.
On the other hand, you can also see it as the judge ensuring the fairness of the trial by not allowing unfounded speculation on the part of the witness, and this applies to both the prosecution and the defense.
On balance, she strikes me as a fair/moderate judge. However, if you look at her rulings, they almost always favor the prosecution. You could argue that is a result of the defense being in a box, and coming up with shoddy arguments that they hope will slip by, or alternatively you could see it as the judge always siding with the state, and favoring the prosecution. For me, it's hard to parse the difference between these perspectives, and probably it comes down to which "side" you are on to begin with.

My question was about whether this was a terrible strategic decision or not. I am well aware that he blamed Mark, per my first comment.
@_date: 2015-01-23 00:33:53
Cool, transcripts would be awesome. It sucks that they are so expensive.
Regarding the defense strategy, I read an analysis where the author was critical of Dratel for not conceding ownership of the server and attempting to assert a fruit of the poisonous tree defense with respect to the server (the judge ruled that Ulbricht could only argue a 4th amendment violation if he admitted to having an ownership interest in the server). The more evidence we see from the prosecution of the Variety Jones ilk, the more I think that this author was right. If you are going to admit to having created the website, it doesn't seem like much more of a stretch to concede an ownership interest in the server, especially when the payoff may be that the government's entire evidence chain could be thrown out.
You're probably right regarding government offers. They have an airtight case. Although, don't you usually get some leniency from the court for pleading guilty up front versus fighting and losing?

So I left out the important part with BitcoinTalk.org. Dratel showed that at a certain point, the forum and market for Silk Road were split from one another. Once the new Silk Road forum launched, the forum software running BitcoinTalk.org and the Silk Road Forum were identical. They both ran on MediaWiki, not a particularly popular forum platform. Furthermore, they both ran the same outdated version of MediaWiki. Not stellar evidence by itself, but in the context of other things, throws more evidence towards Karpeles.

Transcript has been posted! See top of post.
@_date: 2015-01-21 04:28:48
The court reporter takes the transcript in real time during the trial. It is prepared nightly and sent to those who have ordered it. I just have to order a copy from the court transcript office and they will email it to me nightly once it is prepared.
The estimate for the first 4 days of trial was approximately 200 pages of transcripts. That is somewhere in the ballpark of $240 @ $1.20/page.
The idea would be to release them publicly. I don't want to purchase them first and then charge for them, because it is too easy to for someone to buy one copy and dump it on the Internet, and besides I don't want to look like I'm trying to make money off of it. Preferably we'd get 100 people who want to donate $1 a day during the trial (or some variation of this math), and just fund the purchase through the end of the trial.
Can't image why you'd be interested in these transcripts, MagicalTux :P
@_date: 2015-01-16 06:04:31
Dratel isn't done with cross, so we haven't gotten there yet. It's not clear whether he'll ask that question or not. I guess it depends on if he is sure how D-Y will answer.
Dratel was getting D-Y to tell a story of how he was essentially backstabbed by his own agency in Baltimore, who had fucked up his Karpeles investigation. We don't know what turned D-Y on to Ulbricht yet. The most we've heard about that so far is that an IRS agent told D-Y about Ulbricht (he didn't learn it on his own).
@_date: 2015-01-16 06:33:51
So, my notes from trial say Mediawiki 1.17. Dratel said the same platform on Silk Road as on BitcoinTalk. Why would he say this?
@_date: 2015-01-16 05:59:11
I think 4-6 weeks is the estimate.
@_date: 2015-01-24 05:39:49
Yes, I know there is a donation fund. However, I think his Mom tweeted about how expensive the trial is weekly, so I imagine it might be a burden despite the outside help.
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:44:12
It's too early to say what's going to happen regarding his real and alleged activity. If Dratel can convince the jury that the government's case if full of holes and they can't actually prove Ulbricht was the guy for an defined period of time, that might lead them to exonerate him.
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:41:25
Dratel hinted in his opening that there are a lot of Bitcoins missing from Silk Road. The ones that the government busted Ulbricht with are small potatoes compared to the total earned commissions. It will be interesting if Dratel is able to show a path to Karpeles from the Silk Road Bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-16 05:35:38
Pretty sure no. But who knows?
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:49:29
The core issue is direct or circumstantial evidence that the witness can personally attest to. Anything else is hearsay. The cops setup Ulbricht to be in the library, while Cirrus (aka Der-Yaghiayan) communicated with him, for this exact reason. 
Cirrus could testify in court that he chatted with Ulbricht through the computer. He can testify that Ulbricht went online and offline at times that corresponded to him leaving his house and entering the library. He can testify that he viewed Ulbricht's computer and saw the same chat he had just sent Ulbricht on his own computer. He can testify that he found incriminating Silk Road files on his computer. This is all valid testimony.
Contrast that with what Dratel wants him to testify about, things he heard second or third hand from other homeland security agents. He has no direct knowledge of the deal with Karpeles, and therefore his testimony is hearsay. There are exceptions to hearsay in cases where it is not practical to question the parties directly, but Dratel was unsuccessful in arguing this point.
It should be noted that the defense could probably subpoena the Baltimore HSI agents to testify. This might be a dangerous tactic, since there is a risk that the Baltimore agents have proof that Karpeles is not DPR. However, that would be one way to get the information they are trying to obtain through Der-Yaghiayan.

@_date: 2015-01-23 01:00:46
You can eventually get them off PACER (I think). Although to be honest, I'm not positive about that.
We ordered it from the court transcription service. They send a court reporter to trial every day and then sell copies to the parties and to any third parties who request them. The fees for the parties are even more outrageous than those for outsiders, by a factor of 3-7x i think.
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:20:01
yeah, exactly. they're basically trying to demonstrate that ulbricht turned it over to a new dpr, whose profile looks a lot like karpeles.
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:33:09
The prosecution went apeshit when Dratel brought this up. They tried to prevent their own witness from testifying about it on the grounds that it is "hearsay". DerYaghiayan had written an email where he laid out the case for it being Karpeles, and was trying to prevent Baltimore from fucking up the investigation by interviewing Karpeles and tipping him off to a possible investigation of his activity with Silk Road.
Baltimore didn't listen, and did the meeting with Karpeles anyway. Apparently DerYaghiayan got word that Karpeles might be willing to offer the name of DPR in return for no further charges against him.
However, before DerYaghiayan could continue, the prosecution threw a fit and the judge got both sides to agree to table further discussion of the Baltimore info until she can get written briefs on the issue from both sides.
@_date: 2015-01-22 01:46:08
It's a valid point. I'm not stoked on shipping $200 a day to the government for transcripts. If the defense is willing to hand them over, I say fine. I just think they probably have more important things to worry about at the moment, so this isn't going to be a high priority.
@_date: 2015-01-22 21:21:09
There are certain proceedings, for example conference hearings with the judge, that I believe are not available until after 90 days. Some of these documents can be seen on PACER as not currently being available due to the 90 day restriction.
The trial, on the other hand, is held in open court. The transcript is simply an exact recording of what everyone in court is hearing in real time. To not allow its distribution would be non-sensical; this information is public knowledge and court transcripts are not copyrightable.
@_date: 2015-01-23 01:18:01
P.S. Most of the scoops are actually being tweeted before they are in a news article. So transcript == least relevant document when breaking news.

No. Their determination should be based on evidence, not speculation.
@_date: 2015-01-22 01:28:20
This is also a valid point. If everyone who donated agreed to donate to Ross, that's one thing. But there may be people who want to read the transcripts who aren't on team ross.

That has yet to be seen. The prosecution cut off the defense's cross before we got to that stuff. I imagine if it doesn't come out from the cross, then the prosecution will raise that issue on redirect. I have a hard time thinking Der-Yaghian is going to say he thinks Karpeles/Barr could be DPR when it's Ulbricht who is being prosecuted.
I will probably be in court on Tuesday.

It's important because it undermines the government's credibility. We'll have to see where it all goes, there are still a lot of other opportunities to sink Ulbricht. But as far as this witness is concerned, it put a lot of holes in the government's battleship.
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:32:07
Dratel is arguing the following.
*Ross setup the Silk Road as a libertian free market "experiment"
*It was insecure and someone who helped him patch a security hole offered to take it over from him, and Ross agreed
*When the new owner realized LE was about to bust him, he lured Ross back to the site so he could be caught as DPR
The key is that all the drugs and hitman stuff happened in between when Ulbricht was involved. So most of the serious charges wouldn't apply if he wasn't involved in that stuff.

Can you provide some more background on "both used the same unique archaic software setup". There is some confusion, because Mediawiki is what Dratel said. However, it sounds like people in the know don't think that's right. Can you elaborate on specifically what his "archaic software setup" consisted of?
@_date: 2015-01-21 04:33:04
"Dare"- "Yay" - "Gee" (as in Geese) - Yen (as in the currency)
@_date: 2015-01-23 00:51:27
This is what's so confounding about this case, and why the alternate perp/Karpeles theory almost plays. It defies belief how careless he was. And so that opens the door to wondering whether he was just the patsy.
If you recognize that you suck at programming and running servers, and have to rely on outside help to run this business, shouldn't you also recognize that you are likely making tons and tons of mistakes, and plan accordingly. He seemed to think Tor + Encrypted Hard Drive = No One Can Catch Me. The fact that two people close to him knew about his secret is itself an enormous OpSec failure and would justify complete and total paranoia all the time.
Even if you're not worried about the cops busting you, should you really be logged in to your undercover drug marketplace in an open area of a public library, where any passerby can see what you're doing? Insanity...

Yeah, this point is weird. I have to believe that even if he misspoke that they gist of what he is saying is true.

@_date: 2015-01-16 15:59:07
Dratel mentioned that they got a document dump from the government a few weeks before trial. It's not clear how discovery was performed. Presumably the prosecution had access to all this material as well but maybe didn't do their homework?
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:48:17
It's a fair point. But perhaps a small price to pay to know what's going on in an important trial with implications for Internet freedom.
@_date: 2015-01-21 03:32:52
The judge's instruction to the jury was actually pretty tame. It was something like "just disregard those redacted parts of the transcript". However, she wasn't trying to convince them to unhear what they'd heard last week.

Wouldn't be surprising.

There aren't crowds. The judge threatened to anonymize the jury unless the protests stopped, and they did.
Hopefully one does not need to be overly worried about reporting on a public trial in the United States. This isn't some secret information. It is openly available to the public. We are in trouble if you can't report on a jury trial anymore without being worried about your safety.

Running a website isn't illegal. His lawyer is arguing that the drugs and hitman stuff were under the new DPR, after Ulbricht turned it over.
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:59:32
Re:  - I don't know whether he is going to release it or not. He said he's building a website so people can comment on the transcripts and discuss, so perhaps the delay is that he is building that site before releasing them.
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:32:27
We're not there yet. It's as of yet unclear how solid a foundation for the Karpeles thing Dratel has built. This could simply be a strategy to impeach this particular witness, it could go deeper and be an attempt at outright "exoneration", at least for a substantial number of the government's charges. Remember, they're trying to put Ulbricht away for life. If the jury thinks this is some poor kid who got manipulated into being the fall guy for the real drug lord, it's unlikely they're going to convict him across the board, or potentially at all.
@_date: 2015-01-22 16:56:51
Ulbricht obviously helped the defense prepare. This is a tough case to defend, because they were able to bust him with so much incriminating evidence. 
The defense's strategy is probably the best one given the facts, which is that the government can prove certain facts about Ulbricht (caught red handed in the library with a computer full of info about Silk Road, presumably an admission by Ulbricht at some point to a friend that he was running Silk Road), but can they prove that Ulbricht was running the site in between founding it and being busted? This is their strategy to raise reasonable doubt. Of course, whether or not that is total bullshit is for the jury to decide.
@_date: 2015-01-22 20:36:11
What are you talking about? These are public court transcripts, legally purchased.
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:45:20
Let's say you want to start a marketplace to sell seeds. And some of your customers decide that they want to start selling marijuana seeds. They list on the website "Pumpkin Seeds - the 420 variety", and sell them for $20 a piece.
You, being your naive self, don't catch on to this, and over time, out of the 1000's of listings of seeds on your site, 1% of customers start selling seeds for illegal narcotics plants.
Eventually, the Feds get pissed off, and in order to teach your site a lesson, indict you for narcotics conspiracy. Clearly, there is precedent, based on Silk Road, that a website operator who is profiting off the sale of illegal narcotics is liable for the actions of the site's users. Perhaps they even show some emails where people flagged some questionable items and you took no action, thus furthering the conspiracy.
FYI, this scenario isn't unsimilar to what is happening with FedEx right now. Is FedEx an illegal narcotrafficking organization that happens to also deliver legitimate packages, or vice versa? The Feds seem to indicate the former.
Btw, I'm not on the "Free Ross" bandwagon. I think if the government legitimately makes its case, then Ulbricht can expect to go to jail for a very long time. A reasonable person could anticipate that this would be the result of running a site like Silk Road, and indeed, it appears that through the actions and comments Ulbricht made, he in fact anticipated that this could be a potential outcome. 
However, the methods the government used to find and bust Ulbricht (i.e. illegal hacking of a foreign server? NSA internet traffic data?) might be in question, and if legitimized through this trial, set a dangerous precedent for the use of government power in regulating the Internet. Personally, based on what we've learned from the NSA, it seems that this power has no bounds. Coupled with the fact that most of our digital lives occur on someone else's server these days (Google, Apple, etc), and the boundless nature of federal criminal law, won't this make all of us criminals if the government decides we need to be?
Anyway, I'm not sure if you're just trolling at this point, but I think your question was legitimate, so I've done my best to answer it. I do think this trial has implications for what we are allowed to do on the Internet, and the government's limitations on stopping us from doing those things.
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:58:27
Dratel's point is that Ulbricht cashed out almost nothing. For a drug kingpin, that's pretty incredible restraint. Karpeles, on the other hand, was dumping Bitcoin into cash by the truckload. Also, the Gox business covers for the drug business when cashing out via firehose.
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:46:51
Yeah, but if Ulbricht goes free, there's a pretty good chance the Feds are going to go after him. Then he's going to the slammer.
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:54:05
He seems pretty attentive. He takes notes and occasionally whispers something to Dratel. The judge, jury and spectators are always watching the defendant, so I imagine there is a lot of pressure to appear composed.
@_date: 2015-01-16 05:18:26
I don't agree. The defense is taking a line that Ulbricht was involved pre-drug bazaar. I don't know enough about the history of silk road to say whether this lines up with reality, but also realize that the jury is not privy to all info in the real world. They only hear what is said in court. In my opinion, Dratel is making a case for exoneration.
@_date: 2015-01-23 02:08:08
According to PACER, I'm pretty sure he is still in custody. He may have been moved to a different facility, which might account for what you're seeing in the records. According to PACER, he's working on a plea deal with the government. It wouldn't surprise me if his lawyer is waiting to see what happens with Ulbricht before cutting a deal.
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:59:17
That's why the prosecution is shitting themselves. Their own witness, DerYaghiayan, is saying how he wanted to investigate Karpeles, and asked Baltimore not to talk to him. But Baltimore talked to him anyway, and there was word from Baltimore of Karpeles offering up DPR. Conveniently, a few months later, the feds make a "caught red handed" bust of Ulbricht in the library. That puts a lot of reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury. It starts looking like Baltimore has some shady shit going on and that Ulbricht actually was the patsy.
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:50:27
i'm just rehashing my notes. it is possible the defense is wrong about the site url. it's also possible i wrote down the wrong thing. but bitcointalk.org is what i have in my notes as the forum site.
