Some great comments. I guess I was more thinking in terms of adoption in the west since that is what I know. I'm not saying it is a death knell for Bitcoin, just that I wonder if it's adoption will be slowed as people might see it as inferior to the new buzzword / feature in iPhone 6 / iWatch.

Personally, I have a nagging fear that if adoption of Apple's technology is widespread among merchants and consumers, then Bitcoin could appear irrelevant and out of date.
If buying something is as simple as holding my phone near a payment terminal and scanning my fingerprint, then Bitcoin needs to be as easy to use and cheaper to be able to compete.
@_date: 2014-09-06 13:05:27
A fair shout, however they have led to recent consumer electronics revolutions and I don't doubt that they will be at the forefront of the coming wearables generation.
They might not end up being the market leader, but there is a strong chance they will lay the blueprint. So if they get traction with their new network, it's likely that Apple's competitors will follow in a similar vein and it is this future scenario that could impact Bitcoin.
Unless of course, someone throws a curveball and bases their network on Bitcoin. That would be interesting...
@_date: 2014-09-06 14:32:34
Far from it. I am well aware that none of the technology is new. Hell I had an android with NFC a couple of years ago. Could I use it anywhere useful? No.
What is new is the consolidated front Apple brings, its mass agreements with banks and cc providers, and the social capital and buzz its launches generate.

Yea, not true, the UK has access to SEPA as well. Admittedly most UK banks charge for SEPA transfers but not all.

I see this as an on ramp for newbies. You aren't going to be buying huge amounts but as a first intro into Bitcoin the ease and simplicity offered by Coinbase and its ilk represent a potentially huge boon to adoption.
@_date: 2014-09-06 14:36:51
Yes, we have contactless payments in the UK as well.
I think the beauty of well done mobile payments is that you no longer need to carry a wallet and payment details are immeditately and digitally shared with the user. The app ecosystem could use this in really interesting ways, e.g. instant views of recent purchases, statistics on previous purchases, price checking before checkout etc.

Good times are here again. I got into bitcoin just before the last ATH in 2013 and then had the pleasure of the disasters of 2014 and 2015. Last year was fun but today? Today is a good day.

Thumbs up to PwC, a solid response to some thought provoking questions from the treasury. You can really tell that there are a few PwC employees who actively read this sub - I doubt it's the partners though, despite the signature!
I used to work for a different big four firm and it doesn't surprise me that they have spotted an opportunity to make themselves experts in a field which has the potential to confuse much of the existing establishment. After all, they are in the business of "professional services".
I particularly liked:
(1) - They identify many of the key benefits of digital currencies, with emphasis on decentralisation.
(2) - They note that regulation of the entirety of Bitcoin would be a pointless endeavour; instead focus should be placed on key operators.
(3) - They correctly identify how much of a hindrance the UK banking sector is, preventing the UK from being a world financial hub in the new world like it is in the old.
Fingers crossed for the UK government taking note!

You should save proof of each trade you make. In all likelihood they wouldn't ask to see anything, but because there is a chance of being audited you should save a trail. 
You are only taxed on realised gains, so if your remaining £90k hasn't been converted at all and is still sat in the original crypto currency that you purchased, then yes nothing is due on it.

Crypto gains are subject to capital gains tax. Have a read of some of the HMRC pages, it is well documented.
But in short, it works like this:
1. Your sales proceeds are how much you sold for in GBP (actual or equivalent)
1. Your purchase cost is how much you paid for whatever you sold (actual or equivalent)
1. Sale proceeds less purchase cost = your capital gain
1. You have a personal allowance of £11,300, if your gain is less than this you have nothing to pay, if its more, you owe GCT on the residual
1. The tax is calculated as the gain above your PA, multiplied by your CGT rate. For a basic rate tax payer this is 10%, for a higher its 20%.
1. You can choose to settle each gain immediately, or via your end of year tax return
It's really important that you keep really clear records of every crypto transaction you make to facilitate calculating the above. Also keep in mind that you could be audited, and would probably be a reasonable target on a "random survey" given the relative youth of the crypto industry.
Finally, please note that taxable events occur ever time you change from one crypto asset to another and it isn't just when you move from and to GBP. So as a rule of thumb, put aside 20% of every gain making transaction so you don't have to find it in a hurry come tax time :)
Hope this helps.

I think the majority of users now find their way to crypto currency through self interest and to an extent greed. It's unfortunate, but undeniable truth about the human psyche.
So I'd say the majority tend to be more capitalistic now than before.
It definitely brings the subject of privacy and libertarianism to their attention though.

This is a ridiculous post. People are annoyed at how ridiculously expensive it has become to send bitcoin transactions in a reasonable timeframe. They aren't anti-bitcoin, they are the opposite! 
They want bitcoin to succeed just as much as you do and are simply bereft at the state of the situation.
This issue has been blown out of all proportion by some insanely stubborn personalities on both sides of the debate to the detriment of the entire network.

Hi Dietroll,
Fair comments, maybe slightly semantic...
1. Clearly nobody knows if Satoshi is an individual or a collective. A bit beyond the scope of this article, but fair point.
2. Ok... **approximately** every ten minutes.

Are you in the UK or US?
If you're in the US, then yes, you have pay tax at your income tax bracket if you gains are less than a year, so it will be higher.
If you're in the UK, there is no concept of long term capital gains so it doesn't have an impact. However, if you trade daily rather than on occasion, you may be classed by HMRC as a trader and therefore your trades would be subject to income tax rather than capital gains.
