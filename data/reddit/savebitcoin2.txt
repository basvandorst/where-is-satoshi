Don't be surprised if this is deleted or doesn't make it to the front page.
Mods have been deleting posts critical of Mike Hearn.  This was removed from 'new' moments after posting.

And this is a direct link to the video.  A tweet and a youtube video are two different things.  That's like refusing to allow the inevitable coindesk article on this to be posted because peter's tweet already had the link in it.
Or, should I write a quick blog post on medium and then post a link to my blog post with the video in it?

Doesn't matter. He burned all his bridges as soon as he said no to consensus and yes to a dictator.
Mike is destroying his reputation.

I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
Mike has pushed for blacklists, reducing privacy, and dangerously forking the network.
Those links are all accurate.  No exaggerations.

I'm sorry but you're wrong.  They're actually they're quite accurate.
Mike is currently the biggest single danger to Bitcoin's decentralization and the network as a whole.

No, the front page is peter's tweet.  This is a direct link to the video.
Given that Mike is advocating deleting the github commit access of the other core developers, saying that code changes should **not be based on consensus**, and calling for a **dictatorship** of the core code, this is very relevant to the community.
