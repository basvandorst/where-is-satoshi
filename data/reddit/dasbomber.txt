I opened up cmd and typed in this command: 
start D:\ElectrumTHISONEE\Electrum\electrum-2.9.3.exe
And it opened up the program and typed in the password but the same thing happened. Instantly closed down after I typed in the correct password :/ No error messages were shown

I'm on windows 10, i installed electrum from 
 and I've tried both the standable executable method and the windows installer but the same thing happens on both method. I'm assuming its the latest version I got installed which is 2.9.3. You think I should try an earlier version?
I didn't think of it because I thought new was always better in terms of security and whatnot. If you think I should give it a shot, you mind giving me a link? I wanna be sure I install from a reliable source

Why do you use ICA? Use like Handelsbanken or something along those lines. Or is Icabanken a good bank? All I know is that ICA is a foodstore, right?

I'm wondering the same thing.

How do I update my wallet on linux without losing my wallet? Do I just need to install the new update once it comes?

Tried 2.8 and 2.8.2, I got the same issue on both versions :/

Tried the newest version of the portable version and also the 2.8 version but the whole thing still closes down after I type in the password for the wallet. I tried just having 123 as password but the window still closes right down after I click next.
