How do I confirm the signature? I download the file and then what, in order to confirm legit file? I see the sig file on the server, but not sure how to confirm on Windows.

Is there any chance this hardware can go corrupt? And, if so, backup options?

I tried to mine too .Mine accidentally worked out. But, would have been the same if I just bought the damn coins. Bought miners for $10k. Which mined about 8 coins, at $450 each at the time. So wasn't worth it. But today....

I went the other route. 
Took money out of my HELOC and bought a bunch. Have since paid that off and enjoyed 5X gains. Thanks debt!

My Bitcoin has made more in 8 minutes (percentage wise) than my IRA in 3 years. Hate my IRA

Man, $18K has been a fight, and it continues. Thought it might get another $500 after breaking the round number. Especially with all the good news today.

lol. I am, this is just an online vent.

I'm also a qualifier for that number reported. Fortunately, I have a lot of carry over capital losses and, this being the first year of BTC gains, I'm going to use those to help offset my tax load. 
Last year and the year before I had a minor bitcoin loss (on sale), so am feeling I should play fair and report.
Also, I'm a w9 income earner, which makes me high risk for audit in the first place, so not much room to F around as it were.

I'm not counting that. It was so fast that it didn't even factor into the BPI, right?

I'm going to be honest. I've been in Bitcoin since 2013. My best investment? The coins I've HODL. Every time I panicked, day traded or attempted to game the market, it's backfired.

Guh. YOu missed the point. There is a number of "early adopters" who were pushing bitcoin early on, who are still pushing it. The discussion is how to have the "push" to get your acquaintances onboard without the conveyance of gloating.
Could this coin be six figures in next few years. The crazy part is that it's possible, and I want others to benefit.
