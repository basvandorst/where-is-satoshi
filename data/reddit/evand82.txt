"Segregated Witness - Allowing up to almost 4 times the data" Where are you getting this from? I've been looking at the code and presentations and it seems to have the exact same validation model. Any idea how it can allow more data scalability?
@_date: 2015-12-26 22:40:57
You're probably right, but the bitcoin community should at least have the option to debate turning Bitcoin into a two tier network if it fixes all of the scalability issues. In my opinion, having all opinions available in the forefront is the best way to make a decision. I really believe it's the only proper way to build a scalable p2p network that doesn't fall into centralized solutions when scaling becomes an issue (like Bitcoin lightning for example). 
@_date: 2015-12-07 16:01:06
Hello Bitcoin! The Dash project has been doing an interesting experiment and no one is really talking about how it would help scale Bitcoin. We had a great response in at the Latin American Bitcoin Convention and we're interested to see if this technology can possibly help Bitcoin scale and attain mass adoption. It's surely working for us to maintain a stable infrastructure capable of massive growth as you can see in the video. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-12-26 04:06:42
I recently gave a presentation at the Latin American Bitcoin Convention that addressed this exactly. Check it out:

Well, the feature aims to be incompatible with Bitcoin to give XCoin a strategic advantage. We're going in a completely new direction with this, it would be very difficult for Bitcoin to follow.

The Bitcoin network has "core" nodes that people have attempted to attack (successfully for a couple of years). Gavin Andresen has been fixing the attack vulnerabilities for along time, if you look through the source there's a ton of commenting about it. Masternodes are just full nodes, except their paid. It's the same thing. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 12:24:40
You can't PICK the masternodes your transaction will use, it's based off of the proof-of-work hash. The ten masternodes are selected deterministically PER TRANSACTION. The system uses the proof-of-work hash from the transaction depth, therefore the whole masternode network is used at once. You'll have no luck DOSing 3000 servers. 
Look at the whitepaper and scroll to the probabilities section:  . Even if you control 100 of 1000 masternodes (which requires you hold 100K darkcoin), you have a 2.52e­11 chance of being able to create a fake transaction lock.
Comparing greenaddress.it to instantx is apples and oranges. Darkcoin provides similar security of six block confirmations with instantx in 20 seconds. Bitcoin takes an hour to do that level of security.  
@_date: 2014-03-20 09:28:09
Ah, I was referring to users not being able to attack the network by refusing to sign, etc. Decentralized systems have to have protections for things like that.  
I have a scheme for blind signatures, but it's not exactly the same thing. I did some research and I'll definitely port it to using blind signatures, it will work much better this way. Thanks
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:05:18
Maybe my explanation of the signing phase is lacking, this was just a first draft. Here's what it says "Participants in a DarkSend will only sign the finalized transaction if they find that their inputs and outputs are present with the correct amounts. After the transaction is signed and confirmed to be valid, the master node will broadcast the finalized signed transaction and resign."
Each member signs their input away to all outputs and all signatures must be compiled together for the transaction to be valid. I'm not sure if that answers your question or not, let me know. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:52:09
As far as I'm aware, it's still a problem. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:20:28
Sorry, it was a typo.
@_date: 2014-03-16 19:29:01
You can't ddos Darkcoin's implementation, see the documentation. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 19:30:34
I wonder how many bits of entropy could be generated using that method 
@_date: 2014-09-21 04:12:13
Yeah, I see the issue from your perspective. But the system can be enhanced further to hide the identity of the masternodes so no one knows who they are, but yet secured by crypto. So there's 10 soldiers, you know their tokens and pubkeys... but good luck finding them. 
In the end the system will be beautiful, if you want an example ... download the client and sync the blockchain. It'll sync in about 6 minutes for a years worth of data. I synced litecoin the other day and it took an hour for a years worth. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:40:43
It's a peer-to-peer network, so a user is connected to more than one source of data. Just like the Bitcoin client asks for blocks twice to ensure they weren't tampered with, the Darkcoin client asks for the list from multiple sources. It also sees the propagated messages by all masternodes and would ask it's peers for more info about missing ones. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:53:11
The next 2 years, not the prior. I've been working on it for 2 months and so far have implemented DarkSend and DarkGravityWave (a fix for KGW), plus other various improvements. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 19:26:45
Then they can't use the pool, a collateral transaction made out to the master is required to use it. If the client misbehaves in any way it will be cashed, otherwise it's destroyed. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:44:56
The masternode messages are "dseep" and "dsee". Search for those messages. You can look at the way it works in the CMasterNode class.

Get the transaction, then you get the depth, then grab the proof-of-work hash at that depth. It takes the whole network to generate, therefore it's secure. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 19:46:10
Darkcoin is a real project, I work full time on it and have am dedicating the next 2 years of my full time attention. It's intended to have the first decentralized anonymous blockchain, which is called DarkSend and already public beta v3. After that's done I'll do whatever the community wants. I've written over 10,000 lines of code already and expanded the bitcoin reference implementation quite a bit to support this. So no, it's not a pump and dump. This is a real project, it's more like a startup. We're intending to make something really useful and opensource all of it. Check out the documentation for DarkSend,  and the recent anonymity additions in V3, 
@_date: 2014-03-16 19:28:23
The collateral transaction is made out to the masternode (a randomly chosen full node. Picked with a tamperproof algo), so they can't actually pay themselves, just the master node. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:54:07
The deflation makes it more secure, not less. That's the point. If you're going to hold DRK as an investment, or savings you might as well run a masternode and benefit the network. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:34:56
The paper is wrong, I wrote it before I wrote the code. Selection is based off of the transaction's block hash. 
There is no top 50 nodes, it's per transaction. So you'll be DOSing thousands of masternodes. 
Yes, the requirement is permanent. In 50 years the people still running masternodes (if darkcoin is around still) would be really rich and continuing to earn interest on them. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:55:05
The masternode network isn't centralized. It's a specialized class of node that improves the health of the network and provides other services (anonymity, blockchain sync, faster propagation and instant tx). We have currently 900 of them. 
Longer confirmations? Instant validation of transaction and 20 minute block spacing sounds perfect. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 04:18:29
I'm not entirely sure coinbase is a good solution for this yet. Assuming you're transferring $250,000 you'll be limited to selling 50BTC per day to USD. That's about $40k/day, so you'll be exposed to a bit of bitcoins volatility for about a week. Also, coinbase changes 1%, so that would be $2500 not even including the fees to buy BTC in AUD. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:37:16
Currently the masternodes are known. Soon we plan on expanding the masternode system to hide their identity and be known by a token only. You could propagate messages to them with this token.
@_date: 2014-09-22 00:41:16
It's (n/t)*10 , not (n/t)^10. To demonstrate it, I wrote a script to simulate the selection in exactly this way:
So it comes out to 90% of the transactions being successful. 10% being DDOS's. 
Also, these nodes must be denying every transaction which can easily be detected and they'd be removed. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 04:43:27


You're getting really close to the concept I have in mind. First off, you would somehow have to have control of 10 masternodes that are elected. Let's say you have 100K DRK and maintain 100 masternodes, to achieve the probability of 2.52e-11 of getting one chance of attacking (look at the probability section in the paper)? Are you possibly going to gain more by trying to double spend a transaction than you have on the line ? The attack doesn't even make any sense.  
Next, the consensus messages can't kept in a bubble. The merchant would propagate them to it's peers and thus the whole network will have them. How would you stop them from propagating the messages around? So when you propagate messages to the other peers on the network (pool operators perhaps), the locks will obviously conflict and could just cancel out. In that case the client would just wait for normal confirmation. 
Seriously thanks for the very well thought out questions. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 23:38:07
@_date: 2014-03-19 20:40:59
I never said the "new" part was signing, it's the fact that it's a decentralized system to anonymize transactions and it's bulletproof. No one has been able to anonymize transactions in this way until Darkcoin. It's ironic you're pitching centralized mixing services from the forum of Bitcoin. The only reason Bitcoin survived is because it's decentralized. It's the same thing for Darkcoin, it's the users that mix. They don't need any server or any approval from a centralized source to do it. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 13:52:37


The Masternode system already works pretty well and the lists of masternodes are kept syncronised. I'm working on another paper to describe how all of that works and how it utilizes crypto to secure it. I'll definitely release another paper about it. 


1-((tm-a)/tm)^10 doesn't make any sense to me. If there's ten total attackers, that means each has a 1 in 1000 chance of being separately chosen. The chance is (10/1000) collectively for all of them to be chosen independently on any given block. 
Also, you must consider these attackers have a 1000DRK investment that for some reason they're trying to destroy the value of. Masternodes have very defined roles that can be observed by other Masternodes. In the future there's plans of adding a system of punishment/banning masternodes that appear to be bad actors. Other masternodes would passive test and watch what they're doing, in such an event there would be another type of consensus message that the network would respect to remove them. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 12:02:29

The masternode code is open source and just completed an Audit by Kristov Atlas. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:31:12
Ripple is centralized, controls the privileged nodes and it has no mining. Darkcoin is decentralized, doesn't control the masternodes and has mining. They're completely the opposite. 
There's only 4.8M darkcoin total and 1200 masternodes currently. So good luck buying the other 3M. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 22:26:36
Maybe the paper needs to be reworded on this point because you're missing the general idea. Masternode consensus is a event, like a block event that will reverse conflicting transactions with the same inputs on the network. It will modify the memory pool. The Bitcoin waits for a block, Darkcoin will be able to do it TX by TX. So double spends become impossible.  
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:45:20
The masternode messages are "dseep" and "dsee". Search for those messages. You can look at the way it works in the CMasterNode class.
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:58:10
If that were the case, why don't merchants take zero-confirmation transactions online? I should be able to buy a computer from newegg and not wait an hour. It seems like the merchants don't agree with you. 
With Darkcoin they'll get feedback about the transaction from the network within a few seconds. With Bitcoin, you propagate and have no idea if it was successful.
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:04:33
Bitcoin transactions don't confirm instantly. Read the paper. Darkcoin will be able to compete with credit-card processors by providing confirmation in 10-15 seconds in most cases.
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:34:40
Thanks for replying to the whitepaper, I'm the developer of Darkcoin and I was the primary author of the paper. Instant transactions are going to be done via propagation of the transaction to the whole network, then 10 of the masternodes will then propagate messages voting on if they believe the transaction is valid. So no connection to the node is needed.  DOS attacks to the masternode network are possible, but can be dealt with how Bitcoin deals with them, which is effective. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 14:14:58
If you make a transaction with 20 inputs and use InstantX, you'll get a transaction lock on those inputs network wide. No double spending is possible, the masternodes act as observers and will have disagreements if you successfully double spent an input. In the case of a successful double spend, no transaction lock will be formed and the miners will decide which is the real transaction. 
You don't have to trust the masternodes. It's a trustless protocol. Mathematically, there's zero chance of an attack due to the probability of controlling enough. 
Anyone can run masternodes, it costs 1000DRK per masternode and they earn 25% of the mining rewards. So they provide services for the network and earn a dividend. They also are full nodes and allow clients to sync, etc. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 19:01:45
That's essentially what the masternode's are doing, except it's built into the client. They act as observers and report their findings. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 22:04:32
It's done with the masternode code. All open source.
@_date: 2014-09-19 19:07:17
Who said Darkcoin is for illegal things? That sounds like the argument made against Bitcoin for the first three years of it's life (and even still). Privacy is a right. We're trying to make real e-cash on the internet. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 19:16:28
You were concerned about the crypto, no? The whole masternode infrastructure, all of the crypto it uses and all of the classes are open source. The part you're concerned about was just audited and goes open source in a week ( . Not sure why you care about that part? It just finds a vin and signs a message. The part that checks the messages, relays them, manages everything is open source. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:48:50
That doesn't address phashBlock, which can still be null (read the segfault, that's what caused the crash!). And it's not fixed in 0.9.4, and only partially fixed in 0.10:

Bitcoin fees make it very difficult and expensive to properly implement anonymity. That's the only point made in the article.


The super positive paragraph was removed from post, it wasn't meant to be an ad. However it is true that Darksend is the only one that is properly implementing anonymity currently (of the CoinJoin variants). That's the whole point, using anonymity technology in Bitcoin currently is a hazard and is not anonymous (besides centralized trustful mixers) and users need to know this. 


My post was specifically about the design in the paper, I would be very interested to see an implementation using merge avoidance, but it wasn't mentioned in the paper anywhere. 


Exactly my point in the document. Large transactions = more fees, and every solution requires larger transaction. Even though, I'd be interested in seeing this implemented, there are many technical issues to overcome, this specific idea is a strategy I thought of when writing Darksend. 


What about the collateral idea? It's solid and can be used by Bitcoin with no modification to the protocol. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:48:16
Well, so merge avoidance, from the research I've done doesn't help to anonymize CoinShuffle. From what I can tell, I could still deanonymize the transactions. Do you have some documentation showing how you would implement this (I'm hoping it's different from what I just read)? Standard denominations if done in powers of 2 are also broken (if you want documentation on how to break it just ask), so I'm interested in how you would accomplish this. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 15:28:25
Seems like we need a better decentralized governance mechanism
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:47:13
Yeah, bitcoin 0.9 is completely not fixed and 0.1 is only partially. I submitted a pull request and a ticket, we'll see what happens.  
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:33:16


Using powers of 2 denominations provides more than enough information to deanonymize participants. If you want more information about how to deanonymize this type of strategy please let me know and I'll put some information together. I've tried this specific strategy and found it lacking. 
I'm doing more research on merge avoidance. I'm not entirely sure about it yet. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 20:51:09
I would read the stacktrace again, the bug is caused by phashBlock being null (there's 2 separate issues here):  
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:32:47
Hey, thanks for the reply. I look forward to checking out whatever strategy you come up with. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 07:16:08
Merge avoidance: I'll need to think about it some more
Yeah, we're on the same page for powers of 2. It's trivial to deanonomize. Again, if you want more info, just ask, it'll take way more than a paragraph to detail how to break it. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 22:26:34


That behavior is also not secure, each time you join change together from multiple sessions you are basically saying "Hey I was in these 7 mixing sessions (combining 7 change addresses from 7 mixes)". Which says, "Hey the same person bought these 7 anonymous things". It's better, but I think eventually it'll be broken by looking at meta data. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 22:18:14
The DoS isn't even the main issue, I think the whole point is every anonymity software available within the Bitcoin ecosystem (besides centralized mixers) is a hazard to use and the users need to be educated about this. I've seen nothing but blind support from the Bitcoin community for these technologies and they're very dangerous as they stand. 
Yeah, the services can be DoS'd but that's nothing compared to people thinking they're anonymous when they aren't. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 23:46:17
Good article. But I think it's lacking some understanding of the basic limitations of changing existing cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin.


False. What if it turns out the two-tier network infrastructure is required to make Bitcoin scale (I believe it is). In that case, they are unable to split the blockreward up, as is required to make it sybil proof .
@_date: 2016-03-06 22:46:47
No. We're planning on revealing a new type of proof of work model that resolves the centralized mining issues in Bitcoin. Exciting times.
@_date: 2016-03-18 20:51:50
Isn't a centralized company controlling development a large risk to the currency? There's a blockchain, which creates coins every ten minutes. Why can't some of those pay for a new team? Paying for a competing team from a 100% decentralized source of money would be ideal (donations, foundation money, blockchain based funding, etc... anything but this).
@_date: 2016-03-06 14:45:52
Yeah, I agree as well. I don't want to have control of these switches, which is why I'm moving them to being controlled in a decentralized way. Haven't you ever heard "Don't let perfect be the enemy of good"?, I think we need to eventually have a 100% decentralization goal, but it's impossible to get there all at once.
@_date: 2016-03-06 14:52:42
If so that's a huge weakness in terms of growth and stability longterm. These projects need to be though of more like countries than currencies, they need governance, funding, balance of control mechanisms, voting...etc. Otherwise we're just going to create vast inefficiencies, that over time pile up and gridlock the development process.
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:35:30
No connection is required to the masternodes. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 23:23:48
I am being intellectually honest... The Dash governance model can't exist on the Bitcoin network... thus it requires it's own. 
Our governance model uses a 2-tier network by design, which is the most critical component of one of these governance structures. Bitcoin doesn't have one of those to build anything on top of, which is why no one can figure out the solution. You're building on sand. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 18:55:25
Can you elaborate on what you mean? I think you're confused... :) 
@_date: 2016-03-03 22:08:05
Doesn't this still cause centralization of fullnodes? As bandwidth cost rises, many operators will simply drop off because they can't altruistically support the network at their own expense. So in result, companies who can afford it will end up running the bulk of the mining hardware... server farms of it. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 01:44:10
Hey Andreas (how does one implement Dash as a sidechain when the economic model that makes it function absolutely requires a collateralized second tier network which is compensated directly from the blockchain? The economic model that this technology is based on requires that for the security of transactions via instantX and for the masternode quorum (i.e. decentralized oracle) implementation. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 03:17:01
Via fee market... to protect your governance system? eh? How much is the fee to vote? Putting a cost on voting will vastly reduce the participation and create a balance between participation and sybil proofness. Right?
PS. Layer 1 != Tier 1. I hope we're talking about the same thing...
@_date: 2016-03-02 07:24:26
If Bitcoin can't keep up with it's own exponential growth, then... yeah there's a problem. It's not really fear mongering. We have no governance model to even tell what the users want. Blocks have a bunch of spam and there's no way for users to vote to block the sources of it. All of this stuff has solutions, but no one wants to see that happen? 
@_date: 2016-03-06 22:50:11
Sure, but they're not cryptographic currencies... There's only one cryptographic currency with a working governance model at this point. Really, I think the cryptographic currency field is going to turn into a competition on creating the most stable economies. That will be done by tweaking variables related to the governance models. Having none is just asking for problems. Governance efficiencies will add up to better growth rates over long periods of time. 
@_date: 2016-03-02 07:34:06
What about exponential growth? We were growing exponentially early on  (LOG^1 .. not anymore, briefly even LOG^2 at times) and still transactional volumes are increasing 200-300% per year. That means after 3 years of 300%, we need 27MB throughput added to the system to keep up with the economic growth. Lightning is not here anytime soon and the users want to use crypto... what are they going to do? Shouldn't we start using Bitcoin like it was intended, as Digital Gold? When we pay for something $10 we should do the transaction on an alt... if you want to move $1M or something you would use Bitcoin. We could scale this system infinitely... now. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 02:49:12
I'm not quite getting that from this conversation. From what I understand, segwit gives us about 2x the room in the blocksize, even with a 1MB limit (Gavin : "one-output segregated witness transaction would be about 90 bytes of transaction data plus 80 or so bytes of signature– only those 90 bytes need to squeeze into the one megabyte block, instead of 170 bytes."). Besides that there's also the increase to 2MB per block, which also yields a 2x gain. So we're at 4x total, correct? I'm assuming we will resume exponential growth of users once the blocksize ceiling is removed, which gives us 2 years before they have to come up with another solution (if you assume 100% growth in tx volume per year, which is accurate :  Am I missing something?
@_date: 2016-03-08 17:02:53
LN is layer 2, not tier 2. We're talking about 2 different technologies... I'm just waiting for it to click at some point. 99.9% of you have no idea what Dash actually is (The answer: A decentralized incubator running on a new economic model that has never existed before tied together with a decentralized funding and governance mechanism. You think we could have gotten Bitcoin to add all of this code? Really??). 
@_date: 2016-03-06 15:50:53
I mean moving from 99% decentralized to 100% isn't that huge of a step. We do have decentralized governance and decentralized funding in place, which is sponsoring development. However, the Bitcoin project is controlled by a small group of mining pools and has zero governance model.... so there's no comparison. Can one even gain consensus to be added? I seriously doubt it. 
@_date: 2016-03-02 07:21:23
It's more of a governance problem with Bitcoin, it has nothing to do with segwit. Think... why can't the users vote and block all of these spam transactions? We should have decentralized solutions to this.
@_date: 2016-03-06 01:06:50
Well developers shouldn't be in control of governance at all, that's placing too much of the power of the network in one set of hands. I think the developers are the ones that are debating the merits of each decision in the public and the community should be voting somehow (decentralized). I'd rather see some sort of decentralized collateralized mechanism for voting (sybil proof then) or we use use some sort of coin signing mechanism. But either should support the merchants, users and stakeholders separately (why separately? Just so we can have exact numbers. Better numbers and we'll be able to do better science). I'm working on a solution to this.
This is also how I'm going to trigger hard forks, by automatically calculating the amount of users that have updated and basing the fork triggering mechanism on that. Fork updates should be more near 1 month, which is a lot better than just waiting a year or something to trigger.
I think we need to decide we don't know what the best version of crypto-government is yet. But it should definitely be a conversation that is happening, like for example how about this:
- Should we only use decentralized technology when making the perfect governance model?
- Should the governance model have some sort of blockchain based funding mechanism tied in? (E.g, should the system be able to pay for things it needs?)
- Should we have elections?
- Should we vote on core version changes? 
Good things to start thinking about if you're going to make something to last.
@_date: 2016-03-09 00:31:14
I agree. I don't want a war (who does anyway?). I just am positive these are two different technologies and they're being called the same thing. When the scientific community starts talking about all of this, they need solid terms that refer to specific technologies. Will there not at some point be studies about the layer 2 technology? Will there be studies about the two-tier network in dash? Shouldn't we be called them something different now?
How about starting with some definitions?
Layer 2: Applications which are ran outside of the bitcoin network to do a multitude of applications not possible on the Bitcoin network or blockchain. 
Tier 1 : A network of un-collateralized full-nodes which provide services for a p2p network.
Tier 2 : A network of sybil-proof collateralized full-nodes which provide secure decentralized governance and decentralized funding.
When I say bitcoin can't implement the second tier, I'm basically saying you can't add a second tier of "sybil-proof collateralized full-nodes". Follow the logic?

Decentralized and taking into account all network participants. We need to know what the users, businesses and everyone else has to say, right?

Hello, Dash has a backup mechanism where it stores snapshots up to 10 snapshots of your wallet. All you have to do is find the dash data directory, then browse into backups.  I working version of the wallet should be there.

It's a "red herring" because it has nothing to do with the vast about of work we're doing to improve crypto. How does a premine (that didn't happen) have anything to do with decentralizing bitcoin or the idea we had for doing it? 
As for proof? Premine means the coins were mined before release, start reading at page 1: 
The coin was launched twice! Maybe you're referring to the "instamine"? That's not the same thing, there was indeed a large amount of coins issued in the first 24 hours, that went to all of the miners involved, then was dumped and redistributed. I don't have them, all of the early miners got them. In fact I wanted to restart the coin again after we figured out what happened and the community shot me down. 
- There was no premine, it was an instamine
- I wanted to restart the coin a 3rd time and also offered an airdrop to try to fix it
- Coin distribution is better than any other coin other than Bitcoin, so it's seriously a non-issue. 
- It's a red herring because it has nothing to do with the above topic

No one has ever broken the anonymity of Dash. Feel free to try. However, JoinMarket has the same dead-change issues as DarkWallet and CoinShuffle. They are really difficult to solve without extending the protocol like I did for Dash.

Here's the info if interested in understanding how we did this: 
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:57:26
How do you figure? If each node can only provide X amount of blockchain uploading and you add 100 nodes, the networks theoretical bandwidth limitation will be 100 * X higher. Also, as a side effect, if you add many new nodes in this fashion, each node on the network will be responsible for less uploading individually. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 14:56:07
No, there was no premine. Plus, what kind of logic is that? 
@_date: 2017-04-29 02:54:59
Testing options like this on altcoins before possibly damaging a multi-billion dollar market seems like a good idea to me (not that I think it would, I mean in general)
@_date: 2015-11-27 17:09:50
That most definitely makes sense. I don't remember how they were counted back then, but even counted with 8333 not open, we still have declining figures over the years. I was looking for documentation of that
@_date: 2015-11-27 19:29:15
It includes nodes with port 8333 closed, but it does go up to 100k: 
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:53:21
Yeah, the return is about 16% a year on the investment (with the current number of nodes, it's split between all of them). It's a pretty powerful system, it also enables instant transactions: 
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:56:10
Hey, Instant Transaction are working on mainnet if you want to see how they actually work. Confirmation has been in ~3 seconds in all of the testing. It's also not DOSable in the way you describe. It requires 15 of 20 signatures to work, so you would need to control 5/20 of the selected nodes to make it fail. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:04:06
In Darkcoin you can run a full node as a Masternode and earn part of the reward. Each masternode on average earns $31.67/mo for providing services currently. I describe how it works here:

The chick that sued "because the coffee was too hot" literally had her skin melted off of large parts of her legs and required skin grapts. That specific franchise was serving coffee at 190 degrees, which is 30 degrees hotter than the 160 they were suppose to serve at (according to the manual). No
@_date: 2013-10-01 13:18:22
How could you fake running a node? I guess you could limit the bandwidth to like 1kb/s or something and run 20 on a bunch different IPs
@_date: 2013-10-29 15:33:41
Not currently. I have 3x 7970's and I make about $120 worth of LTC in a month and that costs about $50. There's still a profit, but I'm not sure the extra $70 is worth all of the annoying heat coming off the rig.

A better strategy then buying in after a crash is to buy every couple weeks or every month. It's called dollar cost averaging and you'll magically have more bitcoins at the end. 
@_date: 2013-08-04 16:08:58
The network hash rate has increased by an average of 80% the last two months. The increase doesn't even make sense unless they are doing this.

Oddly enough, I don't think Bitcoins true strength is in transaction. Sure that's the first place it's disruptive. But the big idea is that you can replace the entire financial system with something that is completely friction-less.   
The idea that I could start a company and IPO to raise funding using Bitcoin, then those people could trade shares on an open exchange and all with no fees and no central authority. 
Imagine an industry where 1000's of companies have raised north of 10 billion dollars and created hundreds of successful companies.

Who is "we" and what type of equipment were you mining? I just got my 1st asic a couple weeks ago from KnC and it looks like I'll breakeven. I might even make 10% more than I spent in the next six months or so.  I'm also done with mining, I think most people feel this way and we'll start to see difficulty stop rising so fast... and maybe even peak in the near future.

It's a scam in the sense that they promise timely delivery of products, which in reality arrive to you months after. So late that they are usually worthless. Also, during this waiting period for you pre-order, they will refuse to refund you the money after lying to you about the delivery delay. So yeah, it's a scam.

GHOST is an interesting concept. It seems to solve the problem of orphaned block chains remarkable well. Although, what if there are 2+ competing blockchains with the same sub-weight? Which one is the correct one?

You should consider dollar cost averaging into your Bitcoin position (Invest X a month for X months). Then you don't need to guess when we're in a speculative bubble.
 
Although, I do agree we're in a bubble. But I doubt we're going back down into the low hundreds. So you might miss the boat entirely trying to wait it out.

In this not-so-faq it says " Seeing one confirmed transaction means that one miner approves"... this is the way I thought it was, but someone replied and said "One block means everybody thinks that block is ok."

Wouldn't this create a blockchain that grew 600 times faster (changing the block creation from 10 minutes to 1 second) ? How would we deal with the size of that. I suppose pruning would have to be implemented first?

Bitcoin is just a technology like smart phones. At the end of the adoption curve for smart phones my parents actually bought in. They don't really know why they wanted one, they just did. They don't even use their phones like I do, but again, they have them. I liken this situation to bitcoin, at some point the general consonance will be that it's better than anything else for online payments and the people that have no chance of understanding it will start to buy in.  
@_date: 2013-08-27 14:47:16
It's not too late. That's what they told me at first too. Call again, ask for a manager and say you know they can bypass that 45 day restriction once per account.

The equipment to mine will cost money and the reward will be less, so the price must compensate the miners or they will quit. So the price will have to be higher each time the block reward is halved. It also deceases the inflation rate, which will add scarcity, which also adds value.

I.e., if the price discovery mechanism is working the crashes after bubbles should get smaller and smaller as time goes on until the whole market is more like a standard forex market.
