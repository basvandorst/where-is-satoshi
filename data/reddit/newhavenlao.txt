"Knowing China through Taiwan" 
Over sensationalized BS. They are reporting on that 'memo' that was 'leaked' and making pure speculation over it without real confirmation.

Always be wary of articles or 'analysis' that try to predict price/price action (PA) for the future. Rarely these type of people are correct. There is a reason they are writing articles and guessing where price is going to go due to past charts.. Anyone can speculate. 
No one will know what will happen to the price, use all factors, TA and FA to trade the way you want. 
Will BTC and LTC go down? Yes. Will it go up? Yes. Nature of the volatility.

Nothing about this states how much the rates will be. Not sure why people are jumping for joy, paypal is known to gouge the percentage of every sales/transactions they make. Reason why i quit using paypal was because it cost 4.5 to 5% to transfer my own money from one bank account to my US bank account. With Coinbase and BTC China, at most my percentage is 1% of the total transaction or even i gain 1% due to arb. 
If history proves right with Ebay/Paypal, they will just raise the transaction fee due to them phasing out their competition. Paypal is a known name people gravitate to known name than cost saving methods of money transactions.

FBI on this? You want no accountability, here it is! Unregulated BTC!!! 
Seriously, why ask for help if you want no 'insurance.' That is why when investors (not BTC speculators) look for brokerages to house their money, they always ask if there is any insurance on it if anything were to happen.

Cost to transfer money via paypay is 5% (4 something, but near 5 when i did transfer). Doing through coinbase is more cost effective and sometimes gaining if doing arbitrage. Paypal is just piggybacking on bitcoin and hopes to take clients away from Coinbase.. Just look at paypal's layout, they stole that from coinbase...

If you had well over 550 BTC.. Thats over .5 million at one point. Shoulda diversified. The key to financial freedom is diversification.

I deposited from my ICBC account to BTC China. Easy. Took a few seconds to see it in the account.

It was a bitch to get money into BTC China just now. Fucken hassle. The only venue that is feasible is to wire the money to BTC China. Paid 15-30 RMB to do that, other options did not pan out, if it did, then i would not have to eat the 30 RMB wirefees.

OK. I had an issue and you guys fucked up. I bought a GTX770 that suppose to come with 3 games and you gave me one. I called and chatted online with someone yet nothing came about it.. Fix your fucking customer service. Many people on reddit had similar issues to get the round about. I will never shop at tigerdirect again. False advertisement and took too much energy from me. Now i am buying parts from Newegg (well over 1k). I use to be loyal to Tigerdirect until this incident.

Phew, i was going to add money to my BTC China account and buy. But it seems its a bad time. Good luck to those who has coins now.
@_date: 2014-06-17 23:57:24
Take time? How about 4 months? After the first 2 weeks, i contacted. After that i waited another 2 weeks. Gave up 2nd month mark because they did not care, no contact from any department of theirs.
 Found out people on Reddit had same issues but with hardware. Douche? You? Yes. Quit jumping to conclusions tard.

The exchange rate for USD to RMB is pretty shitty.... BTC-e is trying to gain the difference, pretty big difference if the exodus comes. They are giving the 'come with us or your money is gone' kind of option. Smart money move on them. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 07:37:01
2 ways this could go. Fees would go up in to near prices of Paypals transactions (4-5% and up for round trip) with Paypal site and other exchanges. Or paypal would reduce their transactions to 1-2%... Yea that wont happen. Ill stay away from paypal. Fuck em.

You are in the US and they are in China. There could be complications along the way. I am in China now and sometimes txts gets lost or takes a while to get through (i have Chinese number).
Verify them again and see if it works. When i get txt to confirm from BTC China, it comes within seconds, China Mobile number.

Since bitcoin is unregulated, this shit will happen. There is no 'oversight' that will see what can happen or not. MTG will and has driven their price down and it has also affected different bitcoin markets. Confidence in bitcoin is still high as oppose to last year, but the future could be bleak. If you look at it though 'investing' perspective. 
Now what is one of the core principles of Bitcoin? To have a difference currency than the world economy. If you beleive in it, put all your money in it, not in an 'investing' mindset.

I am in China. In order for me to send lots of money to my US account, i have to dish out 5% of the total value. So for every 1000 USD, i have to give paypal 50 USD.. TOO MUCH!!
When i transfered BTC from BTC China to Coin base, i did not use too much, probably 1.5% max. Great deal if you ask me! It takes a few hours but its worth it. Though the exchange maybe different from both, but in the grand scheme of things, its still cheaper than paypal. So 1.5% max to transfer, but with different exchange rates, 2.5% max. Fuck paypal.

Talk to your rep on QQ. If you are in China, it would be easier. 
I used that to fund my account. Took a few seconds to see it. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 09:24:43
Would rather never use Paypal. They will charge lots of money just to transfer coins. Already if someone were to transfer money from one account to another, there could be a 5%-10% charge! BTC is 1-2% max. I will no longer use paypal, fuck them. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 21:11:53
Let me guess, 5% per transaction? I don't like the idea of paypal. Reason why I use btc is to avoid paypal ajd their outrageous fees.

'90/91'?  WTF... Not sure if this is true if there is an online 'drug market' in early 90's.

YAAA for 4-5% increased in fees! Fuck paypal.

Keep this comment up. This right here is why is the mindset of people with no investment exp. The same mind set for BTC is equal to that of using homes as investment props.

Yea when i googled them last month this website didnt show up. It linked me to a facebook.. And thats it. 
This pretty summed it up. Guess with me keep on digging, i found some stuff.. SO yea its a scam. MLM to be exact.
