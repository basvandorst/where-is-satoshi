Is it?
They must be lying on their google store page then.
My point remains regardless. A wallet not even in "beta" stages yet cannot be compared to a giant like coinbase when it comes to implementing new code. 
That said, I hope they hurry up and start supporting segwit.

jesus.. fuck that guy. Me paying $10 just to take my coin off your platform isn't a priority? I think I'm going to finally bite the bullet and get my gemini account setup.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:12:52
This is awesome.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:56:32
Jesus $ 68.56 fees.
Even still, that is only 351.32 sat/B.
Current fees:  next block: 530, halfHour: 530, hour: 500
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:58:25
Fees are now well over $15. I'm a core supporter, but what is funny about that?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:50:41
"accepts" seegwit transactions? Everyone can accept them.

I've been wanting to buy for a while now but haven't pulled the trigger.
@_date: 2015-12-19 15:38:03
Really good news.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:26:40
Segiwt TXs are less costly. That is a fact.
At this point, that's irrelevant. Bitcoin fees are insanely high with or without segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:02:28
They have had blocks over 1mb fwiw.

Nice stuff Coinbase!
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:56:37
Not on IOS right? :( Can't wait.
@_date: 2016-12-12 19:41:38
I only gave them a number and they work great, but I believe you have to give them more info if you want a larger limit. Not sure on the burner question though, worth a shot, just download their app.
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:17:21
It's always listed on the top of their site/app. 
Right now $11,086.27
Coinbase buy price right now is $11,090.10
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:07:54
Because there are no users lol. Their wallet doesn't even have a public release yet.
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:35:38
Thought they'd be more airpods guys.
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:32:10
I've used them a ton, but never one of their ATMs, this is awesome.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:29:30
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:06:26
Reasonable. Thanks for implementing segwit at least.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:59:45
No because it's a BS number.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:26:24
"look at how much energy it uses, it's extremely inefficient."
What a lack of understanding.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:27:43
You got a response from coinbase same day?
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:05:55
Did you go to their site?
The button on the top of their site literally says ""GET ALPHA ACCESS""
Yes there is a "unreleaseed" version on the play store, whatever that means. Point being, they are in their alpha stages. Quite an unfair comparison.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:31:40
LMFAO, no. It does not.
Go to their homepage, you have to request alpha access to an android only wallet. I like the project, but Coinbase gets like 100k users a day, so this is deff not a fair comparison.
@_date: 2015-07-23 00:54:00
Good luck man. That sucks.
@_date: 2017-04-21 20:40:40


Oh yeah? That one review from "John Smith" means your customer service is better?
@_date: 2015-04-16 18:06:21
The blockchain sees no race.
@_date: 2015-04-14 16:57:54
What is "COIN" ? Is that going to be similar to gbtc?
@_date: 2018-07-20 19:31:10
You must be paid.
