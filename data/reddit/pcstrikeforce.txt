It's actually very easy to spend from paper wallets - look for 'Mycelium cold storage spend' videos on Youtube.

From what I've seen, Tigerdirect is a sales company that has goods dropshipped whereas Newegg owns their own distribution warehouses.  That reddit post is an example of what can go wrong with dropshipping (inventory confusion).  Regardless, as a reseller, I can say my experience ordering stuff online on a daily basis has been smoother and faster than with Newegg, e.g. "wow that took half the time".  Fwiw, I have not been terribly happy with Newegg's customer service on the rare occasions it has been needed; iirc last time I tried, phone support wasn't even offered.  Newegg does ship to me faster though, and their customer reviews are generally more numerous, no question.

actually, having recently switched all my business from Newegg: the checkout is much smoother on Tigerdirect and any account related page comes up more quickly.

Thanks. I suspect you're right but I figured eh, why not give it a whirl with something I can easily offer while showing some support.

I'd totally take all payment in bitcoin; spending online is easy &amp; spending elsewhere takes a little effort but it's a small price to pay for advancing the bitcoin network/economy.

According to the slashdot comments, the vulnerability uses the devices' cellular radio and that having no active cellular plan or disabling the cellular radio would mitigate the issue.
