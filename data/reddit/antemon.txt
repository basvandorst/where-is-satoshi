not in the short or medium term future.
debit and credit cards arent even that popular except for upper mid and upper class. credit cards are viewed as emergency funds card. or if one plans on buying a pricey item and want to take advantage of 0% interest. 
for example, I initially got a credit card because I wanted to buy a cellphone. i guess I could consider myself as lower mid-class
very few probably know about bitcoins and the like, save for I guess redittors and pc gamers.

sooooo what you're saying is that, at least in my part, nothing has changed. I personally opt for direct bank transfer.
but what about other types of transfer like cebuana or mlhulier (spelling?)?  
same thing? senders will get a receipt number of sorts that they then message back to their families?
the only difference is the in-betwee  process?

Why, yes. We absolutely abhor it.
that's why thousands and thousands uproot themselves from their homes and families, move thousands of miles and risk working in slave-like conditions in some cases because of it. We just fucking  hate money.
kidding aside. it's just how it's always been for the most part.  Almost all transactions are done in cash. From paying your cab fare to your college tuition. People pay cash.

i doubt that there will be a real market for bitcoin in the philippines.
It's safe to assume that 99% of all transactions in the philippines are cash, especially so for these overseas workers and their families.

as an overseas worker myself, how exactly does this work?
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:18:30
awesome that you understand.
also, you're a condescending fuck.

again, unlikely.
we're a simple people, for the most part
cild hard cash the we can hold is king

really? 1-2.8 plus 25HKD to send?
that **is** steep.
the remittance center I use (in another country) operate similarly to you and just charge a flat rate of around.... 30HKD. Shit's pricier here :/
