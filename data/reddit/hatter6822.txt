You were talking about a situation in which 2013 code is running on the mining nodes, which is ridiculous I know but that would be a result. Try it yourself. The software is available, and if you are in this space you probably have a lab setup that could handle it or access to someone that does.

Ignore them. You aren't wrong. I have way more open discourse about Bitcoin on /btc than here. I was banned here once and only realized I could post again a few days ago. I have a feeling it won't last long though lol

Wasn't trolling. I just came back to see the current state of the sub. Not impressed.

Came here to find someone saying this...let me explain something to you. 
There's two nodes you seem to be conflating.  True network nodes, which mine; and relay/validation nodes (aka "full nodes") which don't mine.
1. If more people use the coin, because it has high capacity and supports more usecases, then the pool of users and businesses interested in running a node goes up.  So it is incorrect to say "larger blocks *perforce* means fewer nodes" because it is true that "larger blocks means more potential usecases which means more users which means more nodes."
2. The only nodes that really matter to the incentive system are miners, and "economically relevant" fullnodes.  You are not economically relevant.  Neither am I.  Wealth is distributed according to a power-law curve.  That means that 90-99% of the network is not economically relevant, and the incentives will hold even if they're driving off the network.  Larger blocks may drive out some hobby nodes, but again, the more usecases, the more people who want to run professional nodes, and those are better for the network.
3. No "economically relevant" fullnode (Coinbase, BitPay, etc) is in any way challenged by the cost to run a node, even at scale, unless and until we actually start hitting real technology limits which are still three or four orders of magnitudes away *at least.* . For the foreseeable future, running a node will remain very inexpensive.
4. The cost of mining is not driven by the cost to transmit and store data.  This is a tiny tiny fraction of the cost to mine.  The cost to mine is driven by the enormous computational /and energy expense of hashing.   A miner could have $20M of S9 miners miners all running against the same $20K node.  The only thing that miner thinks about all day is the cost of electricity and the price of bitcoins on the market.  The cost of the data transmission and storage is insignificant, even at scale.  What a miner cares about is not minimizing the cost of the data, but maximizing the value of the block rewards he is earning.
5. At scale, some miners may misallocate too much capital to hashpower, and not enough to bandwidth.  Those miners will be replaced by other miners who allocate more bandwidth. 
6. Allowing bandwidth to become a driver may actually lessen the hashpower race and create a storage and validation and transmission race that isn't dependent on cheap energy.  This may well have the effect of driving mining away from remote places with cheap energy and towards populous places with cheap networking.  That would be good for Bitcoin.

Yea and every single SegWit transaction would be up for grabs. Both networks have consensus changes.

You realize this is provably false right. Literally anyone can check both chains and see there was a split. There are also [dozens of legitimate publications and media outlets]( that covered the split.

Full nodes followed the only path the core devs gave them. That's what happens when you have one development team controlling &gt;95% of the code on a "decentralized" network.

Or it could also be that if you've used both networks, as I have, you would naturally choose the one that works cheaply, quickly, and more often. Network effect can only outweigh usability for so long :)
