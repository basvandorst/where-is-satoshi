@_date: 2015-01-13 16:33:16
it would be great if people tipped as much as Dogecoin. I have not been tipped at all in bitcoin, but Dogecoin I cant even count how many times I have been tipped.

yeah I guess for a person to person using this service would be helpful. I think other people with their negative comments are thinking more of usage with Overstock.com or a refutable company. I wasn't very detailed in which transactions. 
@_date: 2016-02-23 18:05:09
that makes a lot of sense! websites with just HTTP. or a bunch of images saying it is secure. Makes me weary about putting in so much personal information. shipping, billing, cc info.
