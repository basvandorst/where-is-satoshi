What happening is that over the weekend friends and families talk more than during the week. Note the spikes around Thanksgiving every year. At least it's one theory. Also could be that there is more liquid cash after a Friday pay day. Imagine the amount of data there is to study once bitcoin goes mainstream. We're gonna get some pretty good insights into human behavior.

My concern lies in the data collection required to have an app like this. Linking my credit cards, coinbase and bank account provide this service with great access to my financial information.

In theory yeah, in reality, trump can't be schooled. Not because he's right, but because there's nothing left upstairs capable of formulating any sort of new concept. In 20 years we'll find out trump was some half baked cyborg that regurgitated right wing talking points in a charismatic way to rally the support of the weak minded in order for the elite to maintain control

You for real trying to get someone to tip you like this?

XRP ammiright? Joking aside, are you talking about any other than ETH or LTC?

I'm not at his cognitive level, so grain of salt, but if be fucking bananas after being trapped in my own head for 20+ years.

His campaign page doesn't state that the "freedom divided" will be paid in BTC. You have a source?
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:39:01
It's smart that you're not going all in at this point. Take your time to learn about and understand bitcoin. It's a great journey that hasn't ended yet.

Why can't I see any of your other comments or posts?

The price is not the end all be all here. At this stage, adoption is more important. Every mention, good or bad, has a cumulatively positive effect. People want a real option for money. Trump, while ignorant, is doing us all a service.
@_date: 2019-07-12 04:31:37
Trump is a fucking idiot.
@_date: 2019-07-13 10:06:13
Yes. Also he's disillusioned. He says a bad word about Boeing and the stock dips. That is the "power" he seeks. Bitcoin will end up being his greatest thorn. Especially if he "wins" a second term.

Of course. It would be absurdity for Facebook to let that kind of information not be collected. Andreas just did a good video on libra and this was one of the topics.

Solid reply. Thanks for putting in the effort.

In a parallel universe, OP didn't learn this lesson.

That's an effective strategy.
