Unless it goes to $500...

I enjoy some of Reason’s articles but their bias and appeals to emotion are so frustrating and, ironically, anti-reason. For example:


Nothing in that quote implies snark. They are statements of fact. The [Free Rider problem]( is real and people don’t like paying their fair share of taxes when others lie to avoid it. It’s even more fucked up when you realize the richer you are, the better able you are to pay lawyers to find every loophole to conceal your real wealth.

I don’t like seeing anyone lose money. But some of the comments here about this being the bottom are completely unfounded: we don’t know where the bottom is yet. That will require a far longer timeframe to establish. Considering such severe drops yesterday ~35%, a bounce half that is not unexpected. 
Since bitcoin started declining there have been bigger days of “recovery” than today followed by days of green or red. 
As always, only invest with money you’re willing to lose. Bitcoin could drop to $500 and never recover substantially or it could go to 100k. It’s pure speculation at this point, anyone who claims to know is lying.

They *are* unfounded. Facts don’t require personal feelings. It could be the bottom but only time will tell since testing Support levels requires multiple trends.

Did you even read my comment? I said:


I’m simply pointing out [Support]( hasn’t been established yet. By definition it will require a few significant ups and downs to find that. It’s a statement of fact, not opinion.
