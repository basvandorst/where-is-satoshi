Marc founded Twitter? Not quite. He was an early investor.

Why not Purse.io?

Interesting. So theoretically $160 is the bottom.

Just now I saw a review of the salty starfishes: 
Funny that the guy who runs MeanBlackFox doesn't like them. I personally think they are the ultimate licorice.

This isn't a big deal. Bitcoin has worse problems than this. It's not cool to dogpile on someone just because they are rich and in the public.

Using bitcoin is dirt simple. Easier than PayPal, easier than credit cards. Faster too.

Got my order in of black licorice from MeanBlackFox, and it was purchased with bitcoin.  Amazing stuff - my favorites are the Salty Licorice Starfish and Celtic Knots.
If you're looking for something fun and delicious to buy with bitcoin, check it out.
Btw: this is not an affiliate link or anything like that. I'm just a happy customer.

Why is Bitcoin still in its "infancy", even after five years? Because no one is using it as it was designed. Hardly anyone is spending it.

Long time lurker. Finally signed up to upvote this comment (and the other one you made recently)!

Will you actually "reach out tomorrow"? I call BS.

Coinkite has a handheld payment terminal that gives physical receipts, so definitely look into that.
Personally, I use BitPay for my websites and it's been fantastic.
@_date: 2015-07-17 14:08:53
I was going to check out Satoshibox  and Coinkite  Some good choices out there.

Purse.io is super-convenient and offer big discounts on already low prices at Amazon. I probably sound like a TV commercial, but I regularly and easily save 25 percent on every purchase through them.

One to screw it in and six to confirm you did it right.

Launching my new website Zission, and of course I'm accepting Bitcoin. If anyone has any questions or comments, I'm interested to hear them.

Come to think of it, Freshbooks should integrate with Coinbase.

The value of the Mexi Candy Club is in tasting exotic treats you wouldn't have access to otherwise.

Paying someone overseas with bitcoin. They email me their bitcoin wallet address and within a few seconds they have notification of payment. I've done it about a dozen times and I still get a rush (as does the receiver).
The experience is similar to going from dial up to broadband internet, but even better.

Looks like a solid magazine. Maybe it's time to go back to Linux.

Generally, I stay away from free stuff, especially if it's important to me. Free isn't a sustainable business model.

Thanks for the tip fuyuasha!

Age of Cryptocurrency is what I consider an instant classic. Fantastic read, and very thorough.
@_date: 2015-09-04 11:20:35
The way Coinkite phrased it makes perfect sense to me. 
@_date: 2015-09-12 14:34:02
Not at all. Are you a racist too "bro"?
@_date: 2015-09-05 21:33:27
Love Purse.io. I've used them twice and saved over 20% both times.

What has stunted mass adoption of Bitcoins the most? Is it gambling and other criminal enterprises that give Bitcoin a bad reputation? Too much holding/too little spending, which in turn has negatively affected merchant adoption? Sabotage from government agencies and other powerful enemies? Fluctuations in price?

What does MK's weight have to do with this? Are you his family physician?

*Integrity* in science is vital, something that is sorely lacking nowadays.

I was thinking that isn't much of a selling feature. 
EDIT: Looks cool. Maybe the messaging needs to be tweaked a bit.
