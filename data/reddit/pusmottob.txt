Agreed, but as I have come to learned in this sub only positive things are allowed to be said. I am sure old lady down the street with her flip phone is just begging to get a bitcoin wallet and start using QR codes at the grocery store. Not to mention the transaction limit present is SO SMALL. I am sure Walmart does more transaction by itself then bitcoin could handle.

To that point I have found, people who have bitcoins think it will go to like 8K before the split. People without bitcoins think it is a huge bubble and completely over valued and will drop by ~50% in the next few months.

It not to late until its become illegal or something. As long as it is aloud I suspect in the long run it will keep going up. That being said it could get black listed as a "black market" currency and then we are all screwed. Well except the companies with out real money. On the other hand imagine if 10 years from now it is an international currency accepted anywhere visa/mastercard/amex is ? If that happens it will probably have increase another 10 fold or more.

(not expert) My understanding is basically if you have your money in Bitcoin and something happens to that company you could be SOL because they have all your money and it is not insured. If you have your own wallet, you have the money (theoretically)
