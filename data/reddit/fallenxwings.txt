No, you won't. This is what you say here, everyone same the same when the price is high and they want to buy at 90% discount, but then the time comes almost nobody has the balls to do it.

Bitcoin isn't good as a currency, but it works best as a gold 2.0, and there isn't any other asset like Bitcoin. 
Let me explain.
Why people buy gold now days? They use it as a safe haven because it's production is predictable and it's supply is also predictable, also the value it has is only determined by what we think about it; it's a global consensus defined by our minds, where no government has power, since they can't control our thoughts and can't hide the truth (broadly speaking).
Bitcoin has the same properties, the only value it has is what we give to it, but Bitcoin is superior in many aspects, because it's not physical and thus not hard to carry around. If you bought 1 billion of gold, because you needed a safe haven, and you wanted to transport it (for any reasons, like your country being in war for example), give it to someone else, etc.. you would have big troubles carrying that around, but with Bitcoin it would be as easy as few clicks in front of a computer to send that billion worth to anywhere in the world without anyone capable is prohibiting that.
Bitcoin also has a limited supply just as gold, and it's production rate is well defined by an algorithm which has been proven many times hard to change (S2X, and many other attemps to change it without consensus). 
But governments also can't confiscate your Bitcoins as long as you have the keys. Nor like gold, where governments or bad actors, just need a tank in front of your bunker full of gold to take it all from you. 
And why there isn't any other asset like Bitcoin since there are a lot of cryptocurrencies? Well, Bitcoin has the biggest mining power, and you would need millions and millions of dollars to "hack" bitcoin, nor like other cryptos, where with few millions you would be able to double spend the transactions. But Bitcoin also has been proven resilient to many attacks from many parties, and everytime it survives one, it becomes more resilient. 
There are many other arguments in favor of Bitcoin.

There is a "database" with special properties called blockchain. This blockchain specifies who has bitcoins and how many of them. But as you said, it's not a tangible asset, and its abstract existence is determined by the entries in this special database. The software has built in rules to grant bitcoins with mining. With mining, the software adds new entries in the blockchain specifying the address that will receive bitcoins. For example, an entry could could be added into the blockchain saying that a certain address that didn't have bitcoins, now will have bitcoins, and boom, bitcoins are created. This process is done in a decentralized way; there is no central entity determining arbitrarily who will receive bitcoins. 
And in relation with the other question that is way more easy to answer, bitcoins have value because there is people willing to pay for them.

The algorithm has its own bias (and also some randomness). You can learn how it changes its strategies in response to your inputs. After trying for some time, you should be able to learn how it works, the same way it learns about you. It's perfectly possible to beat it, the only problem is remembering how it has been adapting to your responses (which is needed, so you can change your strategy). After a lot of rounds it becomes too complex. But, there has to be one simple strategy that exploits its main bias related which is hard coded, and apparently relates to our own bias (e.g. if we see tails 4 times in a row, we tend to think the chances of getting a fifth is low). But if you notice this and you try to exploit it, the algorithm apparently notices that, and adapts to how far your bias goes, so you have to play ahead of it.

The leap comes from the fact the bank accounts of exchanges, if everyone try to withdraw money, might go poof. 
The current price is supported significantly by the structure you think will go down. There is little doubt the price of BTC would crash initially. The interesting part is what might happen next. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 21:50:10
There is a very big flaw in your reasoning I think. A big part of the liquidity pool that support the current prices is in the bank accounts of exchanges. In the situation you describe, those banks might have trouble retrieving these reserves. If that were to happen, people would panic and they would try to withdraw all of their money in the form of physical cash. Banks would surely collapse, and with them the price of bitcoin would crash too. 
Where bitcoin might prove useful, is in the restoration phase of the collapse I think, or during it if the monetary or fiscal policy creates high inflation trying to solve the deflation that might happen.

Miners have to pay for the cost of running their operations (e.g. electricity), the higher the cost of operation of a miner the higher is the sell pressure that comes from that miner, since he has to sell his BTC to cover the costs. The higher the efficiency, the less the sell pressure. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 16:05:50
Yup. If there isn't a constant demand for BTC (new money), the price goes down.
At some point it could reach an equilibrium, where offer of miners = demand, you would see a relatively stagnant price there too, but such equilibrium has to be found and I think it could take some time before we reach it.

This is so stupid, and it tells you the bullish bias people still has. 
What if instead of a daily chart we use a weekly chart?
Even more, what if we use the monthly?
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:15:05
There is definetely a relation between the cost of mining and the price, but it's more complicated than just a fixed number. Variables like the efficiency of miners (inneficient miners has to be washed out), plays a role, but the natural demand for BTC also plays a role. The equilibrium is determined based in the cost of production + natural and constant demand. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:51:39
Miners will sell. That's around 15 millions of sell pressure everyday, and with such low liquidity in every exchange, it has a bigger effect than before. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 01:12:41
Sellers doesn't neccesarily have the intention to rebuy at lower prices. Some sellers would sell just because they need to sell to pay stuff. The same applies to shorters; you can be 1x short to not be exposed to market movements, without neccesarily betting the price will go down.  
@_date: 2018-06-19 01:49:27
But you would sell as the price goes up right? More importantly, you would sell eventually.

You can't apply math to model humans accurately. The set of logic rules a human being follows is constantly changing.

He's wrong actually. 
 "Mt. Gox Closes - February 24, 2014 =&gt; Bitcoin value: $547.09     Bitcoin value 10 days later: $662.57"   
You got to consider however that before the official closure, people wasn't able to withdraw bitcoin from mtgox and that the speculation they got hacked was already in the air. But, this happened after the bubble explosion anyway. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:36:40
Well, during the bear market of 2014 there definetely was a constant demand to make the floor.

I don't think he was willing to find truth with the debate, and I don't care about rethoric and winning a "discussion" over the internet. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 19:56:30
His first statement indicated he didn't understand me or he had other intentions. There is 0 doubt about it. Why would I bother in any case? If he didn't understand, anything he said after was just empty talking. 
Also, stop downvoting the people that's replying to you. You might think you are being mature and grown up or something, but everything you had said is nearly in the minds of everyone. 
@_date: 2019-02-17 13:57:50
I appreaciate your overspend time to answer my reply. But, the first thing you said, basically makes everything else just not worth reading.
"That is a whole other topic, but it isn't really relevant to anything I've said."
I'm not sure if you didn't understand me, or you did that one on purpose.

I will start buying once people stop with this "HODL" nonsense. When there isn't even one comment with this word. 
The holders are what causes these boom and busts, and stop the "currency" from being adopted or distributed among others. They might think they are helping the network holding bitcoin and thus increasing its security after the miners rush in, but the only purpose of holders is to sell bitcoin, and therefore all the market cap coming from these holders is "fake", because they will sell at some point. 
If you actually care about bitcoin becoming a world wide currency/store of value, you use bitcoin buying and/or selling it, and then you buy it back.

It encourages spending in \*any\* thing regardless of its efficiency. It encourages reckless spending, bubbles, high risk taking attitude, formation of zombie companies, reckless financing, etc..
It would surely boost jobs, but for how long? Bosting jobs is just an illusion; everytime the unemployment rate reaches certain treshold, the ecomy takes a downturn. What's the point of boosting jobs temporaly and then falling into a recession making people lose the same jobs but this time with a higher debt burden in the economy? The problem is that such loose monetary policies make jobs in companies that are not efficient, and such companies are created in a very high risk taking environment fueled by low interest rates. What would be better, a rational measured spending or an irrational frenzy spending?

Indeed, BTC became boring and there isn't any exciting news out or coming probably. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 03:42:57
The richest guys in that list have a different risk tolerance in comparison with you probably; they can afford to lose all the money invested in BTC just for that one shoot of one day 10 years from now, be the richest guys in the planet. So, when they buy, they probably plan to hold even if BTC goes to 1k again. 
Your risk tolerance might be difference, and thus the fact they are buying isn't a good indicator if you should buy or sell. They just believe in BTC and they are willing to risk a lot. 
Also, as you mentioned, a lot of those wallets are exchange and the increase of BTC in some of them, could be explained by the fact we just saw a very big dip and people got scared and sent their BTC to exchanges (while going down and now that it's going up to sell if it happens again).

This is against what crytpto is fighting for, and that is removing the need to trust in centralized units. 
It would be better to improve over solutions that make it easy to hold and operate with crypto, but without relying in a centralized system.

They are depressed because 90&amp; of the invested population bought above 8k.

 paper I am going to release later this year. I have been working on a new form of electronic money. Bit cash, Bitcoin . . . [y]ou are always there for me Dave.
I want you to be part of it all.”
I would like to see some evidence of that, but if it's truth, we are going for a wild ride in price and drama.
@_date: 2018-07-12 22:39:08
Playing safe is what makes you lose money in investments. Think about the people who thought it was safe to hold above 8k since it was going to 60k. What you are experiencing is called "FOMO", and it applies when you hold a position or when you open a new one.
If you can't take the risk to sell now, there surely is people who are willing to take that risk. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 22:59:58
If they could solve this problem it would be really good or the network, though. I hope they will do more research to find a solution.
@_date: 2018-07-12 23:17:20
As long as you are afraid of selling because it might bounce hard, it could still go down. It's dangerous to sell when you no longer have that fear, because you are certain it will crash.

A similar bet was made around 2014 with Buffet, guess who won. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 01:53:12
We all think we are special somehow. 
Bank of Canada reached a similar result: 5&amp; of Canadians owned crypto.
@_date: 2018-07-12 23:13:44
I don't think they are all gone. As long as the belief: "BTC will reach new ATH the same as it has does everytime it crashes regardless of what happens now", is in the mind of the population, I would say there is a vast number of holders that might not lurk too much around here now that it's getting boring and depressing, but they will surely hold and not sell at a loss until they don't believe that anymore.

You say you can't afford to pay as if you wasn't able to move your BTC out. Either, the whole bet was a lie, since you didn't even consider paying from the beginning, or what you are saying here is a lie. Either way you lied in the end. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:15:28
What you are saying here is a lie. 
You was taken the bet seriously, so seriously that you even sent your address thinking that you won the bet.

You except people to pay you money if they lose, but you can't pay them when you lose. Very sad indeed.

This is a good example you can't trust people will do as they say. Specially when it comes to money. 
One part is naive and the other is dishonored.
