If there was ever a time at least Dopecoin can be mentioned since there is a movie around 'Dope' accepting a crypto Bitcoin.

Funny I had this idea like two years ago and I live in L.A.
**edit:** you could build a walk-way corridor with bullet proof class running down the middle with small cut out holes so people can do their localbitcoin trading. Each exit is on the opposite side so the person walks the other way out the building and can't re-enter in. Ideal safety.

@_date: 2014-03-08 01:48:46
About as open as it gets.
@_date: 2014-05-04 02:55:04
The longest and most reputable [Bitcoin Crowdfunding platform]( is still going .
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:21:00
I bet you like 12 year olds don't you ?
@_date: 2014-06-18 04:27:19

@_date: 2014-02-25 23:24:21
I had the same thing LOL
@_date: 2014-05-16 18:34:20
This isn't going to end well.
@_date: 2014-04-25 05:59:53
lol what a turd!
@_date: 2014-03-15 01:19:29

@_date: 2014-02-25 03:10:29
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:38:39
ya that its no moron. Ever seen who supports dogecoin ? they all look like hill billy's and total rejects of society. Dogecoin is the OWS of coins.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:07:50
This is how I do all my work lol
This newsworthy

@_date: 2014-11-20 21:15:03
This is what he is doing.
@_date: 2014-11-24 00:23:52
Millions of dollars can buy you a lot of sock puppet accounts.
@_date: 2014-05-02 21:24:10
Also, [BTCinstant]( which is about to re-open does giftcards its even easier then Gyft. It allows you to push funds to your own CC or paypal account.
@_date: 2014-04-04 21:26:32
@_date: 2014-04-17 00:28:09
lol ..... +5 Dope
@_date: 2014-06-22 02:57:21
Why is hard left on the right side ?
@_date: 2014-05-17 19:06:19
True,true but the chances someone wants to vote multiple times with a CC probably is less.
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:05:56
Not one or two but 400!!
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:46:43
So it starts.

Rumor is a rumor still.
@_date: 2014-05-09 19:05:13
@_date: 2014-06-18 02:48:37
They should have brought it to [BitcoinStarter.com](  Still trying to figure out why anyone would bring it to a fiat platform only ?
@_date: 2014-01-03 16:27:34
I'm currently frappin to this
@_date: 2014-06-18 03:49:24
I was more thinking of the choice to use indiegogo not so much ProtonMail. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 10:13:35
They are turning it upside down and shaking all your coins out.
@_date: 2014-04-04 20:36:14
I'd just insert/flop my cock onto that scanner.
Also, these two are tools ...
@_date: 2014-05-18 03:13:58
@_date: 2014-05-17 18:08:54
Why not tie people's credit cards ....people still only have one credit card and who cares if its stolen its still a vote lol ...
@_date: 2014-04-21 23:16:30

At least he got that part right ^^ . Bitcoin not so much.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:39:55
He'll look good in prison stripes at his next press meeting.
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:03:24
Thing is people need traffic to their projects so its still ok to have centralized hub for it check out [BitcoinStarter.com](  they are the only Bitcoin only crowdfunding site actually funding projects!
@_date: 2014-05-20 21:28:08
getting same thing ....in chrome...
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:33:02
She probably was unaware of the donation drive.

@_date: 2015-01-18 00:46:14

@_date: 2015-01-18 04:22:49

Hello all I'm the mod over at [r/TipHound]( and we just opened up in the last two hours!   Glad to see this getting some use already!! I ran into Craig and his dilemma [here]( Hopefully, this can help solve some of these issues for creators as they can now sit their assets on reddit and get voluntary tips and consumers get the item nicely sent to them all on reddit! More to come.
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:40:58
those guys are jerks totally interviewed and got denied based of not answering some stupid question about how many degree's in a clock
