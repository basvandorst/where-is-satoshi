Bitcoin is just beginning of a new world. A free and unified world. I just wish transactions were cheaper for small amounts. So we could buy anything like gums. This would make Bitcoin the world currency!

Dam; hope this is a transitory phase

Thank you for your fast reply! 
So the best way to store it long term would be paper? 
I don't quite understand, in reality where is the money actually being stored, in the private key?? If I put my bitcoins in a paper, the bicoin network will know how many bitcoins that adress has and that's why I can spend them when I use my private key? How do I even acess a paper wallet?
