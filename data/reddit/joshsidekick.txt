I feel like it would end up along the lines of tipping in the US. The YouTubes and such of the world will stop paying their content providers but keep the ads anyway because it will then be "customary" for people to pay their content makers in "tips" and why would any of those companies turn away millions upon millions in ad revenue, especially if they can double dip.

I have a vanity plate in MA. Is it just easier to get a vanity plate in NH? I am jealous of the fact that you get 7 instead of 6 digits. And my plate has nothing to do with any of those three things, but I also fully admit I'm an a-hole for having one.

Honestly, yes, with a very big "however". I lost my health insurance, so I was buying prescription medication that I could no longer get prescriptions for. Illegal? Yeah, but it's not like I was trying to be the MDMA kingpin of Central Massachusetts.

I have a recurring payment laid out as well, but it's really only 25% of the income I have set aside for investing, not total. It was less when the price was higher, but now that it corrected and I can get a little more bang for my buck, I increased it from 10%, but the plan stays the same. Either way, though, there's back up plans for if any of my investing doesn't pan out.

I really do not mind watching ads to support content providers I enjoy, but YouTube was the straw that broke the camel's back in my case. I was stuck watching 15-30 second ads in front of 10-20 second clips. I just opened a YouTube tab and any random front page clip to see and it adblock immediately grabbed 18 ads. So you're absolutely correct, the times I am at work and forget AdBlock isn't installed, it really is almost unusable.

I'm a little confused since I'm at work and can't watch the video. Is the money straight up gone or is it the money we send over as bribes. Because how effective can a US dollar bill be in another country? Are the dictators and military allowed to just deposit that money in a bank? If I showed up to buy a new car with a briefcase full of cash, I'm sure there would be questions to answer. So is it missing, or did we just give it to them so they can buy stuff from us later?

Could this have to do with MtGox being $120 to $150 higher than, say, Coinbase? So everyone wants to make money, brings the coins from their Coinbase account to the MtGox wallet for a quick 12 to 15% profit, and overdraws the liquid assets of MtGox. 
I don't have a major understanding of what's going on, so it's a bit of speculation. Couldn't MtGox drop their price to match the other exchanges, essentially cooling the selling of coins from their exchange?

I think one way to avoid this is to set up a weekly automatic purchase order and only purchase additional coins on down swings. We are still at such an early stage of adoption that even at $50 a week now, you'll be leaps and bounds above people in 3-5 years and light years beyond people adopting in 10 years. At least, that's my plan as someone with absolutely zero financial market training.

I've seen a couple articles now saying that the potential value of a bitcoin could be worth from 10k to 1mil. Is that a real world down to earth response, or is it fuel for a hype machine. I was in before I saw these articles, but they kinda make me feel like I'm holding winning lottery tickets and it makes me a little nervous (in the too good to be true way).

I was unaware it was that easy. I think I was afraid that it was going to be like setting up a purchase order where I'd need different ID's and verification and 3-5 business days until I reach level 2.
