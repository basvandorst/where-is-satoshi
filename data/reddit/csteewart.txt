good insight! no one can predict the price! i remember the first time i wanted to buy in and the price rose by 30% over night, just invest if you think the price is right and HODL

Wow.... That was quite the read.

18 here invested a few hundred and investing a few hundred more now, can't believe the price has rocketed so high, feels good to be in it now rather than later.

fair point, I've decided to just go all in (with what I can) and look forward to the long run!

Yea I agree, I'm a student looking to get into bitcoin and altcojn too, I've invested a small amount but it's hard as $1000 barely makes a dent into bitcoin where as alt coins you can purchase a plethora and hopefully in the future they rise quite a bit. I'm more looking to hold for a long term investment and not sell short

Perfect answer, I used to buy at one lump time and it was stupid... dca’ing is the best way to go because it averages out over time so it works in your favor!

Eth/dash/lite etc what do you think has the most growth in the future like Like long long run

As a Canadian we are very limited to the options we have for bitcoin, I was fully ready during the dip but I couldn't as Quadrigcacx and many others had me waiting since October 20 to be verified.. Anyways, Should I start investing at small increments of a couple hundred dollars whenever it goes down a bit? Becasue I doubt the next dip will be any time soon and when it is it will probably be higher than it is now.
