Yes because that it democratically determined by all Bitcoin users. Right?

I sincerely hope these funds will not reach Satoshi and are donated to a charity. Yes, this man has been falsely accused of being someone he is not. For less then twenty four hours. I honestly doubt his life would be altered whatsoever. And even if it, somehow, *does* alter his life, why should we raise funds exactly? As far as I know, the United States are very generous in terms of damage compensation and this money should come from Newsweek and not from us. It just doesn't make sense.

Oh wow, I just realized, this is a twenty minute trip from my house. I think I'm kind of obliged to pay (hah) it a visit now.

This is about the worst possible announcement they could have made. Absolutely no update whatsoever, apart from the fact that they switched building because of two friendly protesters.

I completely agree. I see people over her announcing that 'his life will never be the same' and is 'altered for good'. It's just not. He is falsely 'accused' of being someone else, for a few hours. Every single person that got the news that Satoshi was found, also read the news that he was not. There won't be gangs and Mexican druglords showing up on his doorstep. That's just not how these things work. And even if it were, we shouldn't be raising money. My country has a justice system for that, and I'm pretty sure the U.S. do too.

I take it you put your ferret in a vault?

Except that that debt is (in terms of % GDP) lower than that of the U.S.

I have to agree with you. By posting an open letter, which was intended for a single person, the main objective is not informing that person anymore. It's informing the general public. Since the reporter hasn't done anything downright wrong (Except from the name, which was stupid, but come on) the letter was meant to influence the opinions of people. Negatively.
Now, if you, as a public figure, attempt to shame a person without waiting for any kind of feedback in a community as extreme as Bitcoin, what do you expect..?

They're screwed. However, I know that in my country you cannot simply 'reverse transactions' (most likely to avoid scenarios like this) and I highly doubt it is that simple anywhere. Why? Well, consider Bob , a U.S. citizen, sending $1000 to Alice, who happens to be French. It is unlikely that Bob and Alice have the same bank. So if Bob tries to reverse the transaction at his bank, this bank must get these funds back from Alice's bank. I doubt Alice's bank is that generous. 
There are some flaws in the system as described on Bitcointalk, but it's just a first draft more or less. For example, I really don't see myself using a P2P exchange which takes three days to finish my transaction when I can do it instantly on centralized exchanges. And what about daytrading? Right now it kinda looks like localbitcoins, only, well, not local.

This really made me wonder, what is Mark's endgame? People know his office, his name, his employees. They can't just disappear with all that money. There are plenty of Mt.Gox customers who have serious amounts of money there and, knowing Bitcoin, have the means and / or the will to really hurt this guy.

I'm pretty sure most of the Bitcoin Foundation members already understand the majority of Bitcoin users don't have a lot of love towards Karpeles. As well, the board seems to be a little shady in general. And Karpeles bought his place, they won't just remove him.

The risk is just a little smaller I guess. It's not like you can send a transaction and five minutes later send a message to the network to revoke that transaction. If you want to double spend you have to, well, *double spend*. If you're lucky your new, counterfeit, transaction might get included in the next block. If you're out of luck the first, proper, transaction gets verified. Either way, at least one transaction gets verified and you cannot be sure which one. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:28:46
But why two factor authorization? I use my debit card on a daily basis and it would *really* annoy me to take out my phone and read the text message. I get it for online transfers (my bank delivers me a text message containing a PIN) but for offline transactions it really seems overkill.

The Economist did quite a good job covering the whole Mt. Gox debacle.
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:10:34
Brilliant idea! I'm going to try that at the stock market. Sell some, buy some lower. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 23:24:04
That is beside the point. The economy is shrinking or at least has done so the past few years, so stocks fall in price and profiting off investments is tough. Just look at the record of the last hundred years, and you will see that interest has been (generously so) higher than inflation.

First, I am not exactly sure what positive there is to be found in hidden &amp; offshore banking, stock markets or insurance. Or unofficial, for that matter. We, the Bitcoin community, have had enough experience with the drama and chaos unofficial, or rather unregulated, financial institutions can cause. And all that while Bitcoin was still a, relatively, niche market. 
We can debate about your second point. While I do not see anything fundamentally anarchistic about the internet (which was developed in favor of the ministry of defense, and was made popular by scholars, in some ways the most elitist of all), Satoshi *did* have thoughts clearly in that line of thinking. With regards to Bitcoin's superior financial services, I *do* like cryptocurrencies. As a replacement for fiat, it's perfect. It just doesn't eliminate the need for financial regulation and yes, banks. Just like I can give someone a dollar, without *having* to use a bank.

I don't care what you call it, but please don't call it a Ponzi or pyramid scheme. It. Just. Inherently. Is. Not. Please go read some articles on either Bitcoin or Ponzi/pyramid schemes.
By the way, a currency with no intrinsic value is absolutely perfect. It should be a medium of exchange and nothing else. Bitcoin has scarcity, is easy to transport and is infinity divisible. There's no need for any intrinsic value (dollar, euro, gold anyone?)
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:10:15
You're absolutely right. I just tried to imply that it's not a limit set in stone. Makes it even scarier though. $30,000 per day is peanuts for the big guys (judging by walls in the thousands of bitcoins being thrown up all the time), let alone $3,000. And it would take some time before this is recognized big time and people will actually increase their fees. The damage is done by that time though I recon.

Well, assuming they're doing everything legal, profit is calculated in Euro's. That is, most likely, converted to BTC and paid out in dividend. 
I did some digging though and it seems that they can pretty much decide for themselves whether to include profit from their BTC portfolio (assuming they have one). In general, it should be seen as non-operating revenue as it's revenue gained not from its core activities, which is banking. 
However, seeing as the first line in your quote specifically mentions operating profits, I assume they do not intend to pay you any part of their profit derived from their Bitcoin portfolio. To be fair, this also means that you will be guarded from those losses (not that you will receive negative dividend, but by the looks of it they will pay you dividend even if their BTC portfolio should ever cause them to go nearly bankrupt). On top of that, you hold *shares*, and thus the value of their BTC portfolio will be reflected in stock price, *not* in dividend.

Only Girl A wouldn't get the bitcoin if Guy B hasn't received his fiat money. So Girl A could refuse to send the money, but claims to have done so, only Girl A wouldn't receive any bitcoins and would just lose her collateral. Guy B is a little more screwed though, since he's lost both his collateral and his 1 bitcoin.

To be fair, free video streams are of quite shitty quality.

I never really thought about it but yes, it does. For a mere $3000 a day you can spam the network to its full capacity. Well, until someone flips the switch and ups the transaction per second limit. Has anyone ever tried this? Even with the current fees, it takes about $0.35 a second or a little over $1000 for an hour. I'm pretty sure that completely crippling the network for a day or two will have a significant impact on the price, so there are huge gains to be expected.

First, I highly doubt a query like that would take six hours to complete. Second, there's a whole lot he could do in the meantime. Like, I don't know, communicate to his thousands of customers who have stalled millions of dollars on his website.
That being said, I don't believe the poster.
