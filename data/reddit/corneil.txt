@_date: 2017-12-12 13:24:08
No.  I already sold one BTC and make 5000% return on my entire bitcoin investment.  To me, the ride is more thrilling than the result.  Bitcoin was never my retirement plan.  My house is nearly paid off and my retirement plans are well funded with fiat.  Bitcoin has just made reaching my $$$ goals much quicker and larger than I ever expected.  If crypto came crashing down tomorrow, I would be financially OK, just not fat.

72 hours - but not every node will abide by that.   
You would also need to stop your client that sent the transaction from  re-transmitting (sketchy stuff there).  
  
   
   
If you want to stick with full node AND get SegWit, check out Armory. It supports SegWit. MultiSig, and still uses core for blockchain access.

Tesla Roadster - Buy shares of Tesla instead.   
Net worth doubles - let it ride.

Somebody has to buy at the ATH.

Screw the car, buy the company: VOLKSWAGEN AG (VWAPY)   
That way you get paid when somebody buys a lambo.

Taking profits is one thing (all my initial investment and much more is off the table), but completely getting out is something completely different.  Bitcoin is the ride of a lifetime and there is no way in hell I'm getting off.  Good or bad, I'm riding it to the end (of it or me).

The Tinky Winky's are getting greedy.

Same here.  All my Dogecar swag is in a display cabinet.  That was a shitload of fun, but there's no way in hell I'm going through that again.
