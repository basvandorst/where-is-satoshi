Shit! I found two of my emails in there.

Well, if you haven't figured put already, yes. Names are real.

If you can run WordPress or WordPress plugins, woocommerce is a great shopping plugin that has a bitcoin plugin that can be used in tandem with it.

Wow, you don't think this is real? It most certainly is. 2000 emails leaked. Two of which are mine and I also have been getting the same spam as seen in the imgur link above. Do you think that OP just made up 2000 + emails and names just for karma? C'mon.

At the time of writing this, there are 1600 comments. Which means at this point you will be giving out 1.6 Bitcoin. Which at the current rate is $1130.32. not bankrupt yet. But it's certainly up there :D

Well I am a miner and I mine for them. Love the experience.

I think it's really interesting you asked this now. And the whole reason i like that you asked, is because that is my current project that i'm working on.
Lets start with the pi's specs. I am running a raspberry pi without a digital display while running ubuntu. The mining program i'm using is BFGminer and I am not attempting to go wireless on this. I'm just using the onboard NIC to connect to the internet. There is no need for me to use a display since I just use an app on  my phone to monitor 50BTC.
Now for the solar setup.
I kinda went overkill on the solar, but that's mainly because i am using the solar power for other things. But I currently use a 12v battery bank with 10 batteries (car batteries). Each battery has about 120 Amp-hours at full charge, totaling about 1200 amp-hours. I use two Sunforce 80watt polycrystalline panels to total an output of about 156 Watts at high noon on a very clear day. I use a Sunforce 40 amp charge controller to charge the bank and a simple 800 watt pure sine-wave inverter. I will not use a modified sine wave on anything except incandescent lightbulbs.
But that's about it. it keeps everything up and running smoothly at a rate of about 6.3GH's 24/7... for free!
any other questions let me know.

I think many people are posting comments just for the reward. But, I'm just glad I found a wallet that does not charge you fees and receives payments instantly! That's great.
I am

Apparently you giys were not fully informed. BF labs is currently backordered a year back. They are currently shipping orders placed in september 2012. This is all because they had an ASIC chip shortage from their supplier. Either be paitent, or sell your preorder on ebay.

There's an extension for chrome that lets you buy with BTC on amazon. Pretty cool.
@_date: 2013-09-23 23:02:54
on the contrary! I have already made my money back. This solar setup, as I said before runs more than just my miners. It also runs my two laptops during the afternoon, (when i'm using them) they cost me alone about $50 a year. so, since these are being powered during about half the day that means i've saved approx. $25 a year there. the miners have in total profit made me 1.887BTC so thats about half of the overall cost there. And the best part is, I got the battery bank free! along with one panel and solar charger. so actually, I really only have about $50 more to pay off.( I lied in the beginning). But that will only take me about a week or three to pay. so, this is a great solution if you can find the right price for everything.

Unless, of course, you put your acetone in the same place as your wallet...
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:55:39
That makes more sense, I was a bit scared since I thought it was impossible. Turns out the media is stupid.
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:41:00
Add to dictionary? If not. Try to find a chrome extension that does that for you
@_date: 2013-09-24 01:07:59
yes, you are correct. But, it is still perfectly do-able if you don't run multiple things like I do. the raspberry pi with the miners runs about 40 watts max for me. so you could probably manage with a much smaller panel and maybe two batteries. about a $80 investment if you do it right.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:52:15
Now I understand.
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:54:37
Alright. thanks, guys
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:13:52
Exactly! The Meth business is dangerous!

The video demonstrates the affects of acetone and isopropanol  on thermal printing paper. Gets kinda scary.

Why is that photo (or something similar) ALWAYS the stock photo. Bitcoin has no real world counterparts or legitimate coins for that matter.... sorry. Had to rant a little, just makes me a bit mad.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:18:40
They have those?!?
