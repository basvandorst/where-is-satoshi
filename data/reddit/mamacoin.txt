may be you need to grow up :). May be it is also coincidence that the same day/today Bitmain released big batch with their new machine A3 so Bcash demand grows up. It is good that 2 Ver trolls are joining the post. We are on something :) . And regarding decentralization the whole point of Bitcoin is that no authority/whales/ investors can dictate the price.

hah it is good to know that you are not alone. However investing in bitcoin is the most important decision - the other one... on which price to get on the train really does not matter looking back the time

This speech just made me decide that I need to buy one more BTC. F*ck it....Lets do it, lets try to do it the right. If we did not succeed, it is because of us and our greed and we do not deserve it

Thank you for the link. If you managed it can you add some statistics with Total Volume left now against 3 7 30 days ago, so we can monitor if there is dumps and this reflects current market price. Thanks in advance, sorry that I can not help, as I do not have technical skills :(

I do not have other reddit profile. I would say that I am redittor from 1 month when I decided to join the Bitcoin, to support the idea behind in it and to invest. Thank you all comments, they are all beneficial. I believe if someone more recognized here summarize them and share them will be good. I will add that if we need decentralized network we not only need to invest in the coin, nodes and community but also in mining it if your electricity allows you. I know Asics are loud and could irritate a little bit your life however looks like we need not to let go mining to big corporations ( and BTGold is not the answer). Yes they are huge and have thousands of machines, however we are more than 100K and if everybody have at least one machine that changes the game. So my plans for now are 
1.Mining bitcoin
2. Run full node ( as I am not much tech savy, I will ask for help if I do not manage it)
3.Invest whatever i can afford when S2X attack/dump heavily Bitcoin price.
And for the guys that tell that we are too concerned I hope they are right. However banks and people who are behind them will not leave alone bitcoin so easily and just sticking to comments that it is fraud. So I am expecting very dirty game them from what i see up to now for S2X attack preparation.... I hope i am not right.
