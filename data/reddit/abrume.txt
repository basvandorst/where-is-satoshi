thanks for you answer. So.. can't do anything about it i guess?

is that something they are working on? I wasn't aware of this fact and it seems to be quite a turn off to bitcoin becoming anything near mainstream

Thanks for the detailed answer. Is it safe to assume that the price of bitcoin would be at his all time high near 2032 then? I can't really explain my logic behind it with english, i hope you understand what i'm thinking about.

Thanks for your time and explanation. I understand. I wasn't thinking that it would stop increasing after 2032, rather that the demand would 'overtake' the supply near 2032. Like if today you couldn't print any more money, and everything was literally peer2peer. I imagine the price going up a lot near these years. But i understand your point, and of course, if the interest into bitcoin goes down, either because of politics or other crypto or whatever this scenario doesnt come to mind. Thanks again have a good day!

Hi! And please, relax. Thanks for you answer anyway. My choice of words might sometimes be bad, i'm kinda getting used to speak english.
 I wasn't looking for investment advices. However, i was trying to discuss and learn about BTC and cryptocurrencies, try to read it as "If everything goes fine with Bitcoin, would it be logic that the price increase a lot in a situation like this one?" 
Thanks again, and sorry that my poor choice of words triggered such reactions.
