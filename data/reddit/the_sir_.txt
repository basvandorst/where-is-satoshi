I sold 3 BTC earlier this year for $1200!

There are 3 year olds reading r/bitcoin? Younger generations never cease to impress me.

Do not listen, that is terrible advice.

Everything still going well? Site has been down for most of the day and some odd tweets on your Twitter account.

An MITM is possible whether you know the part you are connecting to or not unless you use 2FA and plan on calling them and asking if you're connected.

Sorry that was an incorrect statement, I was just confused when your website was down and I went to your Twitter page and saw "most read" and thought it was broken English trying to say "must read." I didn't click on the link I just thought it was odd, now I realized it means "most read article."
Fantastic site by the way and congrats on ProductHunt!

I don't think that's true.

Awesome sir! Fantastic site btw, Idk why I didn't think of that.

Sometimes I can honestly believe I have as many BTC as I do. To think what somebody would have to spend to acquire this many BTC makes me very rich. Now to just never sell them!

WTF? No way, moving to Canada.

You can't have abortions or vote but god damn you can have yourself some cryptocurrency.
