I can see how LN will work. Fill the LN wallet with funds. Maybe all the btc you will spend for a year.  Then spend it for almost no fees at all, and if you don't spend it, it remains part of your original balance. Once the network is big enough it will be unbelievably amazing and next level, I can't wait. With respect to the block size Bitcoin likely gains more from avoiding a hard fork, than it is losing because of fees. If you want the devs to change it every time the price drops you will just end up with a shitty lowest common denominator piece of bullshit. Of course the price is dropping today. Have you never seen trading places?

They can't do that without reneging on their debts which would cause a global catastrophe

There is a sobering sticky at the front of this Reddit which you should read....
When the graph is going up vertically it's probably the wrong time to buy!!

As an aside, it is a indictment of the pathetic standard of debate that people have to post "i'm not a troll/shill" before attempting to post on this topic. The separation of the r/btc and r/bitcoin echo chambers is going to be a real challenge in bitcoin politics.
I have heard all the arguments. If I could vote, I would vote for the NYA. Bitcoin is not just about decentralisation but also about protecting the 21 million limit, and doing that means stamping out the competition. It needs to end up the most secure digital currency, with the lowest fees, with the most decentralization, the fastest transaction times and the most anonymity. All these features are important and need to optimally balanced.

That is a brilliant video- thank you for posting. I think I finally understand the Core vision.

I wondered this for a while, then after a lot of thought and reading, I realised that the most valuable chain is likely to be the one with the fewest changes, as it is the closest to the original rules and therefore the safest. Therefore bitcoin will never have a block size increase.

Ha ha thank you for the reassurance :)

That doesn't sound like protecting bitcoin.

I have seen this particular individual's behaviour in the FX markets... There is always a shell game going on. Will it be regulated... Will it not? From this comment only one thing is certain it is a guessing game and someone will be on the losing side at some point... Because he doesn't open his mouth for nothing.

It does seem that the whole mess is an attempt to wrestle control away from Core. I have seen accusations of corruption on both sides and it would be very surprising if the secondary payment network- which will be globally transformative- was not now being fought over by powerful financial interests. I don't know that this is the case, but would be surprised if it wasn't.
Core have played this all wrong because if they had stuck to the NYA they would have continued as client controllers for the price of a trivial increase in blocksize, which would be seen as a positive if they hadn't made such a fuss. Now they are risking losing control of the core client (a massive strategic error) and also risking a chain split, risking the progress of Lightening and attracting reputational damage that will further weaken their position in the long run.
Now we are at this point we all have to hope Core win out but like everyone else I have little choice but to go with the most powerful network and hope for the best.

However Core can still affect the outcome now. Not everything can be about the code. Relationships, perception and reputation are always going to play a role. 
I can understand the argument 'oh the miners will get more empowered and be back for more' which is a concern.
My advice would be that Core should pick their battles. They could have looked like the adults in the room, wiped out bitcoin cash, put in lightening and everyone would have forgotten about block size in 6 months. They would have entrenched their power until the next crisis. When hopefully the circumstances would be better to get the upper hand over the miners.
As I say I hope they win. But they could have already won, by losing a small battle for the greater good.

Everything out of this guy's mouth is a lie. The big boys are talking bitcoin up and down... I'm sure they would love to crash the price and make a killing... However most of us would just double up... 
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:11:30
I think this may well be the case... An alternative is governments return to sound money rather than lose control of their currencies which is the only way I can see Bitcoin can be stopped.
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:42:51
I know this is how Core want to see themselves and no one can say they have done a bad job of that. But as they say politics is the art of the possible.

My node is up. It will be very sad if 2x outnodes bitcoin. I hope others can make the small effort to do the same.

The countries that don't ban will likely attract capital inflows from the countries that do therefore banning bitcoin is not a sustainable economic strategy.
