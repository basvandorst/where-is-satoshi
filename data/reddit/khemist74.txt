We did it! Bitcoin is stable enough to be currency. This is boring, I'm out.

Sold all my BTC at 17.6.  Not jumping back in. I got so lucky!!!

Well, it don’t mean a thing if ain’t got that swing. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:03:42
Let's see if it can breakout of 16K!!

I play a game with myself. I open Gdax and guess the price. I just guess 17.6K and I’m close enough to think I’m a financial Nostradamus.

Take a close look at the sell and buy prices on Coinbase. The delta there combined with it’s inability to execute trades at critical times has me too sketched out to take this crypto-market very seriously. I got out this morning and am not buying on this “dip”. 
Also, the fees are outrageous. Too bad Coinbase isn’t publicly traded. ��

I did similar. It’s all just money I would have wasted on booze and hookers or just squandered.

Jesus Christ, with that sound investing strategy, how did you ever amass a liquid 17K?
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:29:46
Here’s your dip. Jump in bruh. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:46:10
Stay away. You will get slaughtered. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:14:09
Why the resistance at 17K? Psychological hurdle? Fear of prime numbers?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:24:20
I was told there would be money.

No,but not losing it seems to be hard as shit for most people.
