Ok thanks. I will not look those up but thanks anyway.

Does anyone have an idea what this is? Futures trading?
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:19:32
Ah the cryptokids these days.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:20:34
So much for that fat reporter's talk about bitcoin being something for kids.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:37:54
Ok. Is that consistent with your original comment? I can't tell.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:51:46
I enjoyed the gamble. Just like you guys enjoy dodging taxes (or whatever you believe the point is).

Does anyone have a (serious) idea about the sharp rebounds that seem to happen every now and then?
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:38:24
Sure. 
To be a bit more generous, I think he means to say "don't take loans to buy bitcoins, try to get the money by reducing unnecessary consumption instead". But since his text is so poetic, and because the insight is so trivial in any case, I was wondering whether I was missing something.

Nope. Am poor.

Don't the sharks know that in turn, and buy at 5.6k?
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:25:54
Buy groceries from a retailer that accepts crypto and does not adjust for inflation?
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:13:18
Nope. Some things, like bitcoin, has ponzi elements.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:57:00
I am more worried about the inability to explain the sharp increases... (non-religious arguments aside)
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:13:44
Why? 
Not to seem rude, but why do I "need" to start "working for bitcoin"? Is it for my own profit, my mental state of mind, for society, our community, or... what?
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:33:51
What? Edit: oh.
