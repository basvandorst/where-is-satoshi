With most pools you need at least .01 btc to have pool send the coins. With that hash rate , you'll get .01 in like a few months .. Maybe. You might as well solo mine. You might get really lucky and get 25 btc . most likely not though. Lol

You should follow him on [twitter]( He has tweeted about Ethereum several times. Also, here is [Vitalik]( stating that he actually did speak to him in person. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 17:59:52
I don't think you can call Ethereum a shitcoin. Even our lord Nick Szabo has said positive things about Ethereum.

It's a platform for them to express their ideas to potential ethereum devs and network with people who are actually working in the crypto space.

Thanks for your concern. If you're broke, and don't have money to spend on things like this, then stay away. Me, on the other hand, have some extra money to play with at the end of the month. Some of it I save, some of it i use to buy fun toys, some I give to the homeless outside my house, and some I put towards projects that i want to support. Now, if you can't, then don't. Please refrain from telling people what to do with their own money and stop trying to give away your "wisdom".  No one asked for it. Thanks!
