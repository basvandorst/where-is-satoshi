This shouldn't be on the Bitcoin blockchain at all!!
@_date: 2016-08-23 02:03:57
This would do better on Doge chain IMO

When are people going to start building products and services that actually appeal to the mass populace and solve real problems? This is crap.
@_date: 2015-06-27 18:57:19
Here we are again. Solving problems that didn't exist by over complicating and taxing free technology like Bittorrent.

I love the concept. I have been developing a crowd sourced t-shirt business concept involving cryptocurrencies in my head for awhile and will soon be organizing everything into a business plan. Maybe we could bounce ideas. Keep up the good work.

If anyone can spare to send some CCs my way I would be very grateful. 1GRHMrEh71NLfinqGkWosuTzgoDvEzFRzt

What a bad AMA or AUA as they're calling it. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:37:05
I PM'd you. Let's go overseas. I've got connections up the yingyang.

It's hard to trust new Bitcoin apps because of the possibility for malware.

Yeah, but they're going to make him pay the $836 back and he lost the 1BTC. That's a big loss. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 23:07:30
No, not yet at least. I'm very excited about this project, so would you mind posting that info here for everyone to see?
@_date: 2014-08-20 17:06:55
It was not difficult to grasp. Hostility was not necessary especially since the person he continues to personally attack responded and said that he would look into it. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 14:40:48
Bitcoin Paranoid already fetches prices and is well trusted.

I still have not been able to connect to other seeds. I have tried forwarding port 12345 and disabling UPnP, git pull, and publishing a contract. This all happens in Ubuntu. I had read that OpenBazaar was changing the way it would connect to peers in the future. I have been trying to get this working in order to start selling, but it's still a no go.
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:10:21
This happened to me as well. I'd like to know how and why - if anyone can answer that.
@_date: 2014-09-06 22:56:14
Not a big fan of the cost saving/weight saving techniques used on the tiny Lotus cars. The engine is pretty weak as well.
@_date: 2014-08-20 14:51:45
Why is OP so hostile?
@_date: 2014-01-06 15:11:45
This happened to me once and the reason he is asking for donations is because they've blocked all of his accounts. 
I PM'd him and he is not rich. 
The bank will take the $800 and he is out the 1BTC. That's an over $1600 loss retroactively, but now it's an over $1800 loss.
You guys are harsh. He has access to no cash to pay bills and his BTC holdings are small.... like poor people small.

They just had their big event in London

Speculating like a boss ;)

This isn't her first time at the rodeo either
She used to sell Bigcoins with the same scheme and team

I have emailed them and attached several family members who are involved in the transaction. 
Several family members that have lost faith in Bitcoin and digital money because of Coinbase.com - folks we can't achieve a change in the status quo with organizations like this. How is a company supposed to be trusted in handling money that doesn't belong to them, but they don't even have a phone number to call?
@_date: 2016-09-29 08:50:03
Thank you for taking care and resolving the issues! 
@_date: 2015-04-21 21:58:22
Bitt is the future. A progressive social organization. 
@_date: 2016-10-19 22:39:53
Pretty common. You just have to wait for something to happen...
@_date: 2016-10-09 16:04:29
What do you recommend?
@_date: 2016-10-07 23:10:49
Still, no reply from support? Their support is lacking
@_date: 2015-04-13 02:32:04
Keep up the amazing work Bitt! The region will benefit so much from all this incredible work.
@_date: 2015-03-22 20:27:37
Mass adoption in the Caribbean would have huge benefits for the region.
@_date: 2015-03-14 15:15:08
I'm excited to hear more from the full report. There are many opportunities in the currency, banking, and remittances industries in the Caribbean.

Both people in the clip seem to like Bitcoin... maybe you should watch it
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:30:52
The likeliness of a fork seems to dropping and the price moving higher in response
