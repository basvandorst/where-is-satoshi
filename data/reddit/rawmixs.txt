Preach, man. Would love to get my hands in some real cheap btc, know anybody?

If I don't win one, can you offer these on your etsy? I'd love to have one either way!

For those who are not already doing this, the password locker "blur" by abine has a feature to create masked emails that forward to your personal. Makes doing this a lot easier.
Also, everyone should be doing this.

Really? Why not?

Coinbase is frustrating like that. Try also looking at gemini.

I was so excited because I completely forgot about circle and just maybe I had something waiting for me. Nope, goose egg. I guess I missed that promo

Ugh, that looks like shitty cornerstone on demand, even BOA can't get anything better.

I did a same day wire from BoA to Gemini for 20k, $30 boa fee but it was completed within a few hours.
Also, the $500 ACH transfers take 6/7 days to clear, you can buy but not transfer out until then

Ugh. To top off his cringeworthy statement, he spelled "lose" wrong.
@_date: 2019-09-13 01:15:05
Yeah, that guy is an idiot
