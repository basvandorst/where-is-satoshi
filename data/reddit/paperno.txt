Not quite sure what limits you're referring to. We use 1 + 3 out of 8 multisig for big teams. For a really small team it could be 1 + 1 out of 2. So in big teams we select 8 teammates that have some funds on their own distributed wallets, i.e. "have something to lose". If one of the 8 withdraw his funds or become inactive, we switch him to another teammate in all multisigs he co-controlled.

Actually, Slush and Luke Jr. do not have any power at all - they're pools, not miners. If a pool opts to support the old fork, their miners have plenty of other pools to choose from. And miners will mine whatever is more profitable. If mining of the new fork is a tiny bit more profitable, there would be no "20% of miners" that decide to mine an unprofitable fork.
It's up to the market to decide if the new fork wins or fails.

While you can create a team that consists of exclusively your friends and family, there's no limit to number of teammates. We hope that most teams would be big enough to handle most standard insurance use cases - but at a fair price and with no bureaucracy.

Not for each claim, no. A new wallet is generated when a peer joins a teem. 
And it's not a complete randomness. We check that the ones with almost no money can't co-control a big wallet. Also we aim to reduce clustering of cosigners, i.e. not creating an independent group of 30 peers in a team of 1000 members.

From our whitepaper:
Teammates are not limited with a standard set of verification procedures and may require any amount of additional proofs. Also, fraud against peers is much less tolerated than against "the system": 10 percent of Americans agree that “insurance fraud doesn’t hurt anyone.
Re multisig:
Nobody can move your funds without you signature. You need at least 3 out of 8 honest cosigners to get you funds back.
So, even if you somehow manage to join such a bad team, even 5 scammers out of 8 your cosigner can't do you any harm.
Also, small teams are invite-only.
@_date: 2016-03-14 18:41:06
Yes, the teams can do this. This functionality won't probably be integrated in the first releases, but it's already in our timeline.

I think that the perfect starting use case is the pet insurance.
Another one is small-damage car insurance that is below a regular deductible of, say, $500.
On a side note, even if you insure an expensive object, you don't have to insure 100% of it. You can insure just 1% of it to try how it works. If you fill like it you can increase or reduce the coverage ratio at any moment. (Though raising the coverage won't go into effect immediately - for fraud prevention)
@_date: 2016-03-15 02:20:30
Our system is not without limitations. We may change to an ubiquitous solution as we grow, but currently we have to focus on more startup-friendly use cases.
@_date: 2016-03-14 16:00:18
The tl;dr version of our white paper:
- Insurance companies and policyholders have conflict of interests. We propose a peer-to-peer insurance organization devoid of this conflict.
- Teams: Anyone can create a new team. Existing members decide who they want in their team.
- Voting: Everything in a team is governed via voting. The weight of a teammate's vote depends on premiums she has paid.
- Liquid Democracy: Teammates can delegate their votes to proxies. Those who do vote receive a reward so they can do this professinally.
- Risk Coefficients: Each teammate is assigned a risk coefficient by the team via discussion and voting. 
- Fair P2P Coverage: If two teammates have same risk coefficients they cover each other for the same amount. If one is less risky, e.g. a good driver, she gets more coverage from the other.
- Distributed Wallets: A multi-sig wallet controlled by the owner AND 3 out of 8 of his teammates. Wallet owner can veto any transaction. He is allowed to withdraw funds provided all outstanding premiums can be paid out. We coordinate payments but it's teammates who really make them.
- Protection: Our open-source client software allows teammates to collectively withdraw their funds if the server is compromized or shutdown.

Making it 100% decentralized would make it much easier for us to crowdfund through a presale of tokens - same way as Factom and GetGems did.
I mentioned just one reason for us to make it server-dependent. There were quite a few others: 
- hard/not possible to use social network accounts to login =&gt; only semi-anonymous users
- a requirement for client software to be online most of the time
- a need for storage of pictures/proofs for enrollment applications and claims.
- hard/not possible to track/prevent over-insurance 
- hard/not possible to fight ddos and spam attacks
As you can see, we really did investigate the possibility.

Or would you be more glad to pay $5 to a kiddo in India that would give you $45 (and $50 to the stranger)?


Not any type of insurance is a liability insurance. And even these are frequently limited to several thousands of USD of coverage.
@_date: 2016-03-15 01:48:54
Not sure, but it looks a bit over-complicated.
Actually, there is no such thing as "extreme cases of liquidity need" in our system.
Teammates' coverage is adjusted all the time, so they can't claim for an amount that the system is not able to pay out. If a teammate's coverage gets too low (e.g. &lt;90%), he can opt-in to get notified, so he can add funds to his wallet.
@_date: 2016-03-15 13:37:54
For some types of insurance, e.g. pet insurance, privacy is not an issue. For some others, such as car damage, most info is in public accessible databases anyway. And while it doesn't handle the issue in all cases, a team can opt to restrict access to information to members only or to a specific set of members.
@_date: 2016-03-14 23:05:37
The peers would need to sign transactions scheduled by the system if they want to continue to use our services. Once a claim is settled, the system distributes who pay to whom: Some would pay for the claim, some would compensate the voters and some would pay the fee. 
Note: We're considering various monetization models. Taking fees directly from all teammates is just one of them.

Re: 66% vs 75%, I beleive it will be easier to get 75% of hashpower than 66%. Even 75% is considered contentious by a lot of very intelligent people. Big miners would be more reluctant to move to BIP101 if the future fork is not considered hassle-free. Some of them might incorrectly think that "50% + lucky strike might trigger 66% fork". Some others may be more afraid of NonXT miners.
@_date: 2015-08-23 18:28:19
There is no single XT block as of right now, yet there are some on your illustration. Doesn't it make the illustration incorrect?
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:42:21
Thanks for the explanation. I'm afraid it's a bit hard to grasp without any real-world examples. 
The LN whitepaper shows how it works in case of uncooperative users (Alice/Carol) or hub (Bob). In case of Alice and/or Carol being a multi-entity on their own, e.g. Carol being 3 persons controlling 2-of-3 multisig address, it all becomes somewhat more complicated. And even a bit more complicated if some (but not all) entities within internally uncooperative multi-entity Alice are in fact same as some entities of internally uncooperative multi-entity Carol. 
My point is that if LN can handle such cases, it would be benefical for us all if it is explained in some greater level of details. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 19:52:07
It's down to the definition of "mess". 
With 47% of hashpower mining on top of a big block, it would take 33 blocks on average for other 53% to create a longer fork (if my simulation is correct). That's over 11 hours on average.
There's also 0.05 probability that it would take longer than 2 days (135 blocks).

The issue with insurance fraud is that it is often considered victimless, i.e., it's fraud against "the system". On the other hand, fraud against peers is usually much less tolerated. Also, teammates are not limited to a standard set of verification procedures and may require any amount of additional proofs. 


Teambrella is not currently suitable in cases where a regular insurance policy is required by a law or regulation, e.g., it won't work for liability car insurance in most countries. Our plan is to start with "simple" types of insurance and add more complicated ones as we grow / evolve.
@_date: 2016-09-07 00:26:36
Yep, that was exactly our reasoning!
@_date: 2016-09-06 23:03:43


Each teammate's wallet is controlled by the wallet owner and three out of eight semi-randomly selected members of the team. Neither the teammate nor his team can move funds from the wallet without each other's assistance. 
So if the wallet owner loses his key, the money can't be spent.
But in big teams, users don't have to keep large sums in their wallets – they can keep "pay as you go" amounts and add funds to the wallets once a week or so.


Great question. Team members can delegate their votes to other teammates, including insurance professionals. And while those professionals are compensated enough for their time and expertise, regular teammates won't need to dig through claims and applications. 


There is no limit to the size of a team. It can have 10,000 members or more. In contrary to regular p2p insurance systems, where a team includes 50 people that trust each other, Teambrella is not based on trust. Instead, we align interests of all teammates:  
Every decision is up to your teammates. And they need to make it fair -- otherwise they can't expect a fair treatment if they have an incident.
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2016-09-06 23:12:08

Teammates don't enjoy the level of anonymity that bitcoin has. They need to provide proofs to get reimbursed and they need to provide ids/photos for getting covered in the first place.
If you, as a teammate have any doubts about a person being honest, you can require additional proofs and vote for 0% payout until you are not convinced.
@_date: 2016-09-07 20:08:20
Great questions, thank you!


That's correct. And it's one of the reasons why we start with providing cover for cases where possible payouts are relatively small.
We'll add support for other cases as we grow. 


We use relative estimation of risks instead of absolute values as in traditional insurance. 
We believe it makes the process easier and more transparent. E.g., you can always see that you cover 'John' for $10 and he covers you for $15 in return. 
Also, we think that the effect of wisdom of the crowd would fight with crudeness of risk values set by teammates. Especially if those would be set by a handful of professionals, even in a crude fashion.


We're starting with coverage for collision deductible and pet insurance. So the risks you mentioned are not applied to us at this moment. We'll probably won't going to provide insurance for natural disasters or other 'contagious' risks until we have some reinsurance linked to the system.


We're not going to provide full collision coverage for very small groups. For non-contagious risks a situation similar to what you described becomes less probable as the size of the team grows. 


There are no contracts in Teambrella. 
If the team decides to pay the claim and someone doesn't pay his share, he won't be able to access the funds without the help of other teammates.


It's up to the teammates, but in most cases, yes, this info would be open.


There are no contracts in Teambrella. 


Basically, you gave a definition for bureaucracy. In Teambrella, teammates would vote basing on their estimation of what is fair or not and use their common sense for this.


We haven't implemented it yet, but it's possible to make each teammate's history of actions accessible by other teams.
Also, it just doesn't make sense to act like a jerk -- the said person would risk of not being paid by the team if he files a claim himself.


That's true. That's why we keep small teams invitation-only. Additionally, we would require new teammates to be  facebook friends of someone within the team. (It's not that any facebook friend can get into the team if he just wants to, the team would still need to decide if it wants him in.)


As long as most voting would be done by professionals acting as proxies, the social effect you described would'n probably be that significant. 


Yep, the bitcoins have to sit in the wallets. But you don't have to pay upfront for a long period of time - You can keep a "pay as you go" amount and add funds to the wallet once a week or so. So you don't pay an insurance company to invest your money for you, you can do it yourself.
Also, we're not providing life insurance and earnings on the float don't have that much of effect to insurance premiums in P&amp;C insurance, especially with low interest rates.


While your funds are stored in Bitcoin wallets, insured values, claims and reimbursements can be nominated in any fiat currency or bitcoin – it's up to the team. 
 
In big teams, users don't have to keep large sums in their wallets – they can keep "pay as you go" amounts and add funds to the wallets once a week or so.

If the validity is checked only by a handfull of non-lazy nodes, 
who will catch "everyone"? You need 51% of that "everyone" to be either non-lazy or have another non-lying source. What is the incentive for other sources to exist? I.e. if being lazy is more profitable than being non-lazy, how would you prevent 51% of nodes from relaying a trusted but lyeing source(s)?


Better the devil you know.
@_date: 2015-04-12 17:19:07


The "crime" you're talking about is relaying known results instead of verifying them, i.e. being "lazy", right? But how can the equilibrium punish this "crime" if the relayed nodes are non-lazy (the first ones)? I can't see an incentive for non-lazy nodes as it would be quite costly for them to punish the lazy ones. And they are the only ones who can punish for "lazyness".
Imo, the validation network would quickly evaluate to (semi-)trust network, with faster nodes getting most of the rewards. 
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:23:26


I beleive it's the other way round. Once I see a confirmation or two, it just doesn't make sense to proceed with validation as it takes much more time than just relaying the known result. 


If I know that the first two validations came from nodes that never (&gt;100x times) misbehaved, it is not profitable to recheck the validation info even with this "10000x" rule. 
@_date: 2015-04-12 10:41:08
Is the price of running of a validation process considered in the paper (sorry, I'm yet to read it it thoroughly)?
In a stable network where the number of invalid blocks is close to zero, wouldn't the most profitable behavior for a validator be just to copy-paste the results of fellow validators?
@_date: 2015-11-10 13:01:06
One of the main points against raising the blocksize is decentralization of miners. I.e. smallblockers claim that
a decent connection is too expensive for some miners. Wouldn't the said DOS-mitigation infrastructure cost a lot more? Basicly, a miner/pool would need to use a new set of IP addresses for creation of microblocks each time it finds a key block.
Moreover, there would be whole new reasons to DOS a miner. One of them is prevention of posting poison transactions.
@_date: 2015-11-10 13:57:11
It's kinda hard to release 1GB instantly. He would need to release them in a fixed order, one by one. Once the first several 1MB blocks are released, he becomes the new DoS target.

You mentioned workarounds for miners. There could be workarounds for DoSers as well. It's money vs. money - people with money find a way to DoS. Look as Slush - even being a major pool they had to stop mining for, khm, some clients.
@_date: 2015-11-10 13:46:32
Well, unless the blocksize limit is dropped it isn't. Miner B could create a series of 1MB microblocks, but woudn't be allowed to create a 1GB block with all transactions that appeared in the network while miner A was beeing DoSed.
@_date: 2015-11-10 21:07:18
The major problem I see is the shifting of the control from miners/pools to big corporations who pay a lot of fees.
[When mining subsidies end] Any company that produces ~1% of fees may decide not to post its transactions while the pool is the 'tzar'. This would lead to pool getting 0.4% less profits. In turn this would lead to all its miners flocking away to some other pool.
@_date: 2015-11-10 14:04:45
Unknown IPs become known after being used for a single time.
The problem is some miners would need more resources to stay in the game. Hence more centralization.
