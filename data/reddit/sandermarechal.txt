Where is the original WU ad that was fixed by the WU-vs-Bitcoin ad?

Do you ship internationally? And what are the shipping costs then?

It's not bad, but it doesn't really explain bitcoin. It reads more like a sales ad than an explanation. It explains some of the things you can do with bitcoin, but doesn't explain why things work the way they do and why it's better. I think that is a lot of what people keep asking here and on The articles that do explain these things are too difficult.

Great! You might want to add this to a FAQ or something like that on your site. I'm sure other people would love to know that as well.

A bitcoin card compatible with existing visa/debit/credit card payment machines. This would make it possible to pay with bitcoin in nearly every store, restaurant and bar without a major payment infrastructure change.

FAQs are good to look up specific questions. They are not good at reading front-to-back in order to understand a subject. So it's not very useful for newbies who probably don't know enough about bitcoin to understand what they are actually asking.

In all honesty, the bitcoin wiki links suck pretty bad at explaining bitcoin to non-techies. As a techie myself it even took me quite a while to understand it properly. Perhaps should write a decent ELI5 guide to bitcoin, add it to the sidebar *and* add it to the "submit a new text post" page.
Edit: I just did an ELI5 in another thread. Maybe work off this?
