Think that was a forecast, because it also said September but based on the activity and progression with the market the dates started moving up

Yea coinbase verified me in minutes. I figured the $1 charge was a fee so i used the random ones as my input and then voila!

This is how ive been reading the market as well. Its going to be a risky couple of months as they will more than likely have an inverse correlation into the new year. Definitely dont want to be on the wrong side. 
The thing that draws me to BCH is that it is supported by many and not as volatile for a downward trend. Its potential is gargantuan though. 
Tough call. Just watch the market carefully each day. Read up on credible news sites and watch out for the whales!
