I dont plan on buying anything really. For me this is an oppurtunity at possible financial independence. Maybe a chance to start my own businesses or go into philanthropy. Never been one for lambos.

I try not to think about it lol. We dont know how long it could be or our worst fear that somehow it fails. Either way i stack my sats and have faith in the product. I just try to keep up to date and mindful.

Makes sense. Its obvious what it means just doesnt read that way to those used to the other format.

Pretty simple math there. 100 million per btc. And likely no. Bitcoin would basically have consumed the worlds economy if it reached this level. And measuring it in usd would be silly at that point.

RH crypto and Rh are technically already 2 different accounts they allow you to operate from the same app. If you want only an RH crypto account simply dont buy securities. Youll only recieve crypto tax documents and your money will stay within the Rh crpyto account. But until it becomes a wallet there isnt much use in their feeless structure unless your buying securities. Plus their mark price and adjustment for volatility really sucks most of the time. Their limit buy/sells dont operate well. And they dont allow stop losses within crypto. So basically you dont pay fees but you lose alot of capabilities. One major capability is the ability to move your crypto or spend it.
