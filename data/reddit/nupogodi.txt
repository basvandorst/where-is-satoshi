He wanted the safety of the police around. She wasn't trespassing, it doesn't work like you think it does. It's not illegal to go ring someone's doorbell. There's no indication in the article that she was on private property after she was told to leave, or when this interaction occurred. Police chase after criminals, reporters are not criminals (when doing their job) and investigative reporters are extremely familiar with trespassing laws.

How long does verification usually take? I'm Canadian so I'd be doing level 3. Also, I don't get bills in the mail. I do have bills that are emailed to me as PDFs though, like for internet access. They look the same as if I'd have scanned in a bill. Does that count? Also, when doing pre-authorized debit, do I get charged the Interac network fee or does it count as a POS transaction or what? I'm with ING so I wonder what the best option would be.

I find this complete distrust in the media a bit disturbing. They editorialize and misrepresent things like crazy, especially in America, but it's pretty crazy to think that a senior investigative journalist would *make shit up*. To assume so is to be wildly ignorant of how journalism works.
This reminds me of the Rob Ford story, where for a long time the majority of the public thought that the Toronto Star simply made up the whole crack video thing. And people just couldn't understand - you REALLY think someone is going to put their career and their paper's reputation on the line to *make things up*? 
It's silly. Call the media biased, say that they pick and choose quotes from interviews, editorialize, whatever. But literally making things up is not something a journalist does.
The far more reasonable explanation is that the conversation with the officer was longer than what she quoted, and she told him that he was allegedly the creator of Bitcoin.

God, appealing to the authority of *rms* isn't going to help your case.

Yeah, I understand the point of BTC, but if you have to buy BTC for each payment that means someone has access to your bank account information instead of your credit card information, you will certainly incur a fee for the process of adding dollars to your account and exchange fees for buying the BTC (all that does is effectively shift merchant fees to you), and due to the volatility of BTC's price if you pre-buy the BTC in anticipation of next month's payment you may find yourself without enough to cover the bill. Since withdrawing money from a bank and buying BTC usually takes a few days, there is no real way to do this "in real time" while making the payment without the company doing it assuming some risk - for which they will certainly charge a fee.
Basically you didn't understand what I was saying at all. If you have to buy BTC every month to pay your bills, it makes BTC completely useless.

I really love Apple products, especially their laptops. The iPhone really works perfectly for me for 99% of what I do. I really have no idea why they are doing this though. It seems heavy-handed and short-sighted. Bitcoin wallets on iOS aren't going to threaten the fact that they have millions of iTunes accounts with attached credit cards. The apps are not illegal, or hateful or pornographic or whatever reasonable things they ban in their ToS. I really don't see why they would do it - even if you assume they are evil and doing it entirely for self-preservation, it doesn't make sense since the idea of Bitcoin is in no way threatening to Apple's business model.

No, he can verify that you signed with your key transactions that belong to you (up until that point in the chain).
The problem with double-spending is if you manage to send your coins back to yourself before that transaction goes through. 
Retailers eat the cost of theft and fraud all the time though, the idea is that hopefully BTC will cost them less to accept than credit cards and the benefit will much outweigh the risk of being targeted by sophisticated attacks like that (which should be minuscule)

You had to give them that information and sign a form (digital signatures count), and the company doing the withdrawals has a relationship with the banks. They have to apply for the ability to withdraw. Obviously it makes sense for an electric company to be granted that ability.
You can't just walk into a bank with someone's information and do a withdrawal with someone's info though. And if you are an employee at a corporation that has that ability and you abuse it, the customer will accuse you of fraud and you'll lose your job and your company will lose a lot of money.
I only had to give my rental company a void cheque for them to do withdrawals, and sign a form authorizing them to. So technically you're giving all that information to anyone you give a cheque to.

Think of it as "sending money across nation's borders". For example, wiring some USD to your family in Mexico is a remittance. It's important for Bitcoin because Western Union and the like who deal in remittances (a huge market) are expensive and slow compared to Bitcoin. 
By 'impound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages', he means he doesn't want illegal immigrants to send money outside of the country and wants to seize that money. 
The interesting thing is that as it is now, if you are wealthy, moving large sums of money to different countries is almost trivial. If you are not, sending a few hundred to family in Mexico, India, China etc is usually  stupidly expensive.

Each Bitcoin is infinitely divisible. If you want to divide them further than a Satoshi, the software would have to be updated to support it, but it's simple. The system (on paper) supports infinite divisibility.

Energy cannot be created or destroyed. "Hashing" is not an 'output'; energy is not *used* on it. For all intents and purposes, all of the electricity that goes through a semiconductor is converted to heat. Now, there are exceptions - radios and LEDs and such specifically convert energy to EM radiation, but that's irrelevant. 
So, actually, a miner is a perfectly efficient heater. Compare this to a lightbulb or an electric motor, which convert energy to light or physical work. Switching transistor states, on the other hand, only has heat as an output.

No... If we were to increase divisibility beyond 1 Satoshi right now, it wouldn't affect the value of BTC against USD *at all*.
For example, right now you can pay (with cash) values down to 1 penny right. Well what if we had coins like "halfpennies", so that a cup of coffee could cost not 1.24 but 1.235? You know, you'd give a dollar, two dimes, 3 pennies and a halfpenny. Exact same idea. 
Because Bitcoin has a fixed amount of coins that will ever exist, by its very design it will increase in value over time (as long as people are using it and it has value at all). So, you know, you can imagine a scenario where a large cup of coffee costs 1 Satoshi because 1 BTC is worth 100mil USD or whatever. Suddenly if you want a small cup of coffee, you need to be able to pay in "tenths of a Satoshi", which takes you down to units 10^-9 BTC, so you need to be able to handle it.
The reason it's infinitely divisible is because this will happen eventually by design. Since our physical money is inflationary in general, we go the opposite way - pennies are useless now, in Canada we've gotten rid of them and just round cash transactions to the nearest nickel, and eventually sometime in the future we might need 1000 and 10,000 dollar bills.

It seems that a lot of people here style themselves anarchists or take libertarianism to the extreme; in their view, any sort of large institution is inherently evil.
Personally I don't understand it. I can understand why a state-less digital currency like Bitcoin would attract these types, but I simply don't understand their positions most of the time.
I think that kind of attitude hurts the community at large, since the only hope Bitcoin has of actually becoming widely-adopted is through the full support of large institutions, yes including governments and banks. 
If their view of a system free from fiat currency doesn't also realize that there must be lenders of all types - Bitcoin payday loans, Bitcoin credit cards, Bitcoin mortgages - then they are delusional. The more Bitcoin is associated with these anti-establishment views, the more it hurts their own goals. 
But alas. Credit cards are run by big companies with the support of government so they must be evil, I suppose? It is what it is.

Less. Depends on the scale of production. All it's doing is signing transactions for you, it's a slightly more complex SecurID tag. I bet you could get the price down to under 10 bucks if you made enough of the damn things and simplified the hell out of them.
You still need a device with an internet connection and access to the blockchain though, not just the hardware wallet. Here's one thing I don't understand about people thinking BTC will replace cash - how are you going to use it offline? You can't. What if the power goes out - everyone stops accepting money? You can sign a transaction offline if you've got your outputs saved and then take it online later, but that's a lot worse than cash - someone could fake that and then boom, you get online and the transaction doesn't work. Not a problem with cash...

Calculating risk is different than fraud alerts and chargebacks. Though, realistically, I've never seen a 'risk assessment' provided by a payment processor, though I know Newegg does something like that and flags you for further verification (basically just due to a large order)
I imagine it depends on who you have the merchant account with and what sort of things they implement. I didn't see it on Cybersource or Chase PaymenTech but I may have missed it.
Regardless, it's still just a guess, not something solid like a fraud alert or a chargeback, and it doesn't cause any delay.

Oh brother, you have no idea.
Come on. All I'm saying is relax, Bitcoin is neat and as a math and comp-sci guy of course I find it all very fascinating, but it does not really compare to the scale of other open-source projects. I mean just looking at market cap right now it's like 1.4B USD, do you want to hazard a guess how much money is invested in GNU/Linux? :P 
Don't make it to be more than it is. Let it grow organically. Pumping it up with false fanfare before it's had a chance to really prove itself does us all a great disservice. 
The fact is, the market is still highly volatile and very susceptible to manipulation (all this talk of 'whales'). Governments aren't sure what to do with it, and could easily put the brakes on it by driving out exchanges and BTC-related service bureaus. The market cap is tiny relative to the economy of ... well, everyone. The only people really interested in it at the moment are technologists, anarchists, and speculators. There's a big problem with BTC being conflated with political ideals which undermines the entire point. And, realistically speaking, very few people know about it.
So, most impressive concerted effort? No. Not even close. Everything I've listed trumps it. 
Does that mean it's worthless? Nah! Clearly we believe in it. But don't make it out to be more than it is. It's disingenuous. It's a distributed cryptographically-secure accounting table. It's not a new world order or whatever, not yet.  Be patient and relax your prose, because you're not going to win any of the mainstream over with that rhetoric.

Heh yeah telnet is pretty ancient but that's how bitcoincharts.com exposes their ticker. They have HTTP to grab the latest prices but they ask that you only hit it once every 15 minutes, and I don't want to be a dick but 15 min also isn't good enough for me. 
Telnet is perfect when you're not transmitting anything sensitive. I mean, it's almost as pure as you can get without hooking up a serial console.
edit: It's actually pretty neat what bitcoincharts does with their telnet service, whenever a trade goes through on any of the exchanges they track (and it's a LOT), they write a line of JSON on their telnet. So you can sort of track whatever you want using their processing power/scraping/whatever they use. It's awesome. They say it's experimental and not to use it for bots tho ;-)

I believe in laws governing landlord-tenant agreements and I believe in building codes. Does that mean I believe in government workers coming into my home whenever they please?
I do believe in having a strong central authority: to maintain the integrity of the financial system, to provide health care and a social safety net, to uphold laws and build infrastructure the private sector would never have any interest in like roads, bridges, subways, parks, schools, libraries, among others. 
Bitcoin is an interesting idea and I think the concept of a de-centralized currency is one that we need to explore, regardless of what happens in the end. Unfortunately your political ideas have nothing much to do with currency; banks and governments will exist regardless of what they deem to be their currency. 
So, call me a "statist" - whatever THAT means. As far as I can tell it's the opposite of anarchy? Well, no, I'm not an anarchist. I don't think you can boil my politics down to a single word, and I think it's wrong to mix politics with the concept of a cryptocurrency. That you conflate these ideas, and that so many others do too, should actually be cause for considerable alarm. Attaching politics to a technical idea only hurts the idea. 
... but please, tell me more about what I am.

Banks constantly have promotions where they give you free shit, relax. It's usually a cross-promotional deal, it's like advertising spending. If someone wanted to sell Bitcoin related services, tossing people a hardware wallet for free that they make in China for pennies is no problem.

I read the margins on those are still over $1 and it works because of volume. They also sell pop and cookies and chips and shit, on which the margins may as well be infinite considering how cheap those are and how expensive they are to buy at Subway.
As I've been telling other people in this thread, "they" will never accept Bitcoin. Subway is a franchise. It's up to the individual franchisees. As the largest restaurant chain in the world with over 40k restaurants, there is no way that they could reasonably mandate accepting Bitcoin across the entire franchise, nor would they considering how low Bitcoin adoption is across the general population. Most of the locations don't even take AmEx and plenty of people have those. You might say, ohh Amex has high fees, but Bitcoin requires buying tablets and doing training, all for a tiny chunk of a tiny market.
Just be realistic, guys, come on. Aim for the sky, good way to live life, but realize you're not going to hit the moon with your slingshot.

There are some USB drives with write protection switches.
Realistically, just trust your distro not to write to it if that's what you want. You're trusting it anyway not to steal your Bitcoin as long as the computer is connected to the Internet. If you trust it to do that without reading every line of code that goes into it, you may as well trust it when a distro says it won't write to the live-USB.

I'm ignorant because I disagree with you. Alright then.
We have government loans for education in Canada, our tuition prices are entirely reasonable. Clearly the problem lies elsewhere than the concept of loans.
You want to privatize all basic education? You think this is a good idea? I have nothing to really say about that.
You want to get rid of regulation? Deregulation is practically the CAUSE of the recent economic collapse. People who stand to make money will do so at any cost. Deregulation and privatization of key industries leads to Enrons and AIGs, this has been proven time and time again.

For example, quickbt.com will sell you at about ~130 CAD right now, CanadianBitcoins.com will sell for ~121.60 CAD, but it's been traded as low as 114 CAD in the past 12 hours on CaVirtEx.

I suppose I may have parsed your sentence wrong but you are not correct, none of the fraud detection happens at the merchant level. There is nothing to "double check" when placing a credit card order - if the number looks like it's valid, you pass that on to your payment processor and it'll come back and tell you whether the authorization or transaction went through. If the card is stolen, it'll come back as a failure - immediately. After that, you are clear to behave as if everything is kosher. Fraud alerts take weeks to filter down from the card-issuing bank to the merchant, and chargebacks usually happen after you have shipped/provided service.
Getting fraud alerts in time to stop processing is actually a big problem since there are so many card-issuing banks.

I'm a professional software developer and I studied mathematics and computer science at university. I have written parts of an operating system myself. 
With my credentials out of the way, you're wrong. There is nothing fundamentally wrong (or even fixable) about the 'fundamental level' that computers or operating systems work. You are going to need total control over the system at *some* level. Currently we trust the operating system's kernel to have that task, yet kernels are complex beasts and so their attack surface is large. Modern operating systems already run as little as they can in ring 0. You would do what to fix or change this, exactly? No matter what, you are going to have code that has full control over the system somewhere. And if you can run code on the machine that interfaces with this kernel, it's nigh-impossible to guarantee there isn't an exploit that allows running malicious code as the kernel.
The only way around this is to never run unverified code, where you can be 100% sure everything that executes is not malicious. This would be something like a spacecraft or airplane computer. You don't see people running web browsers on an Airbus flight management system. 
For the way we use computers, this end-to-end trust model is impossible. We want to load websites off the internet, execute JavaScript. We want to download and use applications we haven't personally written or audited. 
With these three things in mind:
- we need to run unverified code
- there will always be code that has access to the entire system by definition
- it is not feasible to make guarantees that an exploit doesn't exist or can never be found for large volumes of code
it is  clear that the issue is not with the way our computers or operating systems are built, but the issue is with computing itself.
And please, don't talk down to strangers. It makes you look dumb.

There is no reason for a homeless person in Norway to live on the street. Legally, social services are required to pay for temporary lodging for any citizen who is unable to manage for themselves. Something like 1.4/1000 people are homeless, and a completely insignificant number of them live on the street. You don't have that kind of safety net in America, or Canada for that matter.

Not really. Let's not get hyperbolic. Banks provide services in exchange for you lending them your money. One of those services involve fraud protection and insurance. To provide services like that on a large scale without being susceptible to fraud yourself, you need to put procedures in place that may seem somewhat invasive. When you do stuff like wire transfers which involve *other* institutions that have their *own* procedures in place, this complicates matters even further. 
In the end though, it's not that 'a bank' is some sort of institution that a) can have feelings or b) feels that your money is theirs. It is simply bureaucratic nonsense as many other things are.
Bitcoins are neat, don't get me wrong, and a good replacement for cash. But if you wanted to provide the same services that banks currently provide, a BitCoinBank if you will, you are going to see these *exact* same procedures put in place.
Remember, there is nothing stopping you from literally mailing cash (other than mailing large amounts possibly being illegal depending on where you live because of tax reasons?) but you wouldn't dream of doing that...

It's bad reddiquette to just keep downvoting each other.
Why do you need branches? And what do you mean by 'interac fees'? Like, email money transfer fees? Well, no, you don't pay that to the bank but to the network. You mean like ATM withdrawals? Yeah anywhere on the Exchange network is free. So far I haven't found anything that I *needed* a branch to do, but I suppose my banking isn't very complex.
What do you mean "pay anything for a savings account"? You shouldn't, if you have a reasonable balance. If you don't, you're probably a student and qualify for a free student account.

You people are so paranoid of the banking system. If you pay off your balance every month, credit cards do nothing more than *work for you*. It's fucking stupid not to have one. They provide all sorts of fraud insurance and you can find one with benefits/perks that appeal to you. 
edit: Not to mention how fucking dumb it is to loan the credit card company 300 bucks just so they can loan it back out to you. Secured credit cards are for people who have utterly destroyed their credit and still need access to a credit card, if you are eligible for a standard credit card it is monumentally stupid to opt for a secured one.

That works out to 41.25% (0.55 * 0.75) that you get to keep. Food is taxed at a lower rate. Various other things are exempt from VAT.
On the other hand, education is free, medicine is free, no one is literally forced to live on the streets and starve or freeze to death. Also their average income is ~84K USD. The Norwegian who spends all of his (entirely average) income on the highest-taxed items gets to actually spend 34.65k USD/yr, which is more than the average American gets to spend. Yet the American worries about health care bills and going hungry if something were to happen to his home.

That's not how this exploit works. Go read on how the Android RNG exploit worked, it's the same thing.
The basic idea is that if you use the same random number to sign two different transactions, it is trivial (literally it's just algebra) to derive your private key. With your private key, you can transact all you want using your funds.
Effectively what this does - having an RNG bug like this - is broadcast your private key to anyone who knows how to find it. Cute, huh?

If you're just going to rely on physical access to a hardware wallet or what have you, why bother with all the signing nonsense anyway? Just use a [one-time password]( device. 
Regardless, it's still poor security if you don't have an actual password but use only a physical device to restrict access - if the device is stolen, you are boned. Normally these things are part of two-factor authentication.

If you have a job at all you can easily get way more. Otherwise just pay it off in full for a few months, funnel all your spending through it, and they'll give you more credit with a simple phone call.

Well I'm sure you can configure the distro not to write to the boot drive, but it's complicated. During normal operation a good Linux desktop will still be touching files all over the place...
"Talis", a Linux distribution for secure anonymous web browsing, does not create a persistent partition on the Live-USB by default, I believe. You can create one I'm pretty sure in the free space left on your drive if you want, but otherwise they promise not to leave a trace. Good place to leave an encrypted wallet file, anyway.
I'm sure there are other Live-USB distros out there that behave similarly. I've not thought too much about which ones write to the USB or not. Anyhow, aside from being super-paranoid because you're dealing with millions of dollars and signing transactions from cold storage, I think a Live-USB with an encrypted wallet file is about as secure as you get while being reasonable.
@_date: 2013-11-17 11:55:28

I don't know? Americans get debit cards through the credit card network and you can use them online and run them as credit cards. Everyone else in the world uses the Interac/PLUS network and those are not widely accepted online or as automated bill payments at all, usually only at points of sale.
Using a debit card on the Visa network won't build your credit though.
