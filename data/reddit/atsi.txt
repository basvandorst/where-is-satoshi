You fool. Do you read anything before investing?

You must be new here

This series was (is) on Netflix and the guy is trying to sell bitcoin at $600 each. How long ago was that?
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:26:42
Or do, wait for the alt coin price to increase in btc price then sell. ??? Profit

This has to be the funniest gilded comment I have seen

It's not even a real licence. Truly, have a geeze at their subreddit. People are buying into tokens on misleading information.

So I should sell all my alts for btc, wait until the price pumps then buy the alts again when the price (in btc) has lowered ��
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:48:14
Put some btc in paper wallets, laminate them and forget about them for a decade.

No wonder why people are moving to BCC.... seriously it's full of memes. I reckon 95% of people here haven't even read the white paper 
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:13:54
My advice for you is if you decide to invest your satoshis (% of bitcoin) into alt coins, dont keep your eyes on the usd price, write down what price you bought the alt coin at ( I.e 0.0003 btc) Bitcoins are hard to come by, don't waste them all on Alts that only hold their fiat face value and drop in satoshis price.

Not all tokens are built on bitcoin platform, not all tokens are tied to bitcoin. Pick a good token that's built on the ETH block chain.

Yeh that's what I'm saying. I put 0.5 into fun at 200 sats. Neck minnit it's 1btc. I know how to play this game.

I have been seeking this answer for weeks! I just didn't know what or how to ask it, thank you for that link

The smaller the amount you move to another wallet the longer it will take. (Unless you pay a massive fee)

Forget everyone bashing your post, OP. Atleast you actually read the white paper and understand what you're investing in. I can guarantee you most the people here haven't read it and jumped on the sole reason for lambo land.
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:22:33
And have you actually read the white paper?
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:15:43
Jokes on them I have paper wallets
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:22:54
A generic date! Not the whole world follows that style of date. Is 2017.05.04 May or April?  5th or the 4th? MAY 4 2017, 4 MAY 2017, 2017 MAY 4 ?

Unless you live in a country that has heavily subsidised healthcare. Yknow, most of them that aren't America ������

Hold your own private keys. Then you'll own both. Whatever is the dominant chain, you'll own it. Even if the original btc takes a dive to $3000 and b2x skyrockets, you'll still be winning.

I just hope plot twist he has 100,000 btc.

Fuckn oath ! Second times always a charm 
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:14:38
At least have a generic date? 3 NOV 17? Instead of Y.M.D?
