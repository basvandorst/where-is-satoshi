What do you understand as cheap? My full node running on an VPS uses about 10MBit upload on average. 20x would be 200MBit.
At home i only get 18MBit down and 2MBit upload. For more upload i would have to get a company contract which is expensive.
Running a node which only leeches from 8 other connections yes, that works on a cheap internet. Running a real full node which also accepts connections (my full node has ~90 connections on average) does not work an cheap internet. At least not for me.

Sorry for the late answer. Numbers are directly from the VPS webinterface. I do run different stuff on the server but most of them should not cause any significant amount of data. Numbers are from a month calculated down to per second. I still use 0.9.3 so maybe it's coming from other nodes getting the full blockchain. Normal operation is much lower i have to admit.
And I had that VPS before to play around so I just put a bitcoin node there because it was idling too much.

Yep. Maybe someone should tell the OP about 
If you go back to Nov 2013 then LTC had a really big volume, but everybody dumped after it. Which is exactly why i bought LTC some time ago. I did expect a pump (chickun will fly!) and am currently looking how high it goes and then sell and wait until it gets back to 0.008 BTC or something.
BTW: LTC is like poker for me. It's a game and i hope everybody who plays LTC knows that. BTC however is real;)

Depends on the what you define as "improves his income". If miners are honest = "try to avoid double spends" then bitcoin could also be used for zeroconf transactions =&gt; more transactions and maybe more fees for miners. If miners allow double spends to increase their income then no zeroconf =&gt; maybe (i don't know) less fees for the miners because of less transactions.
Yes i do know about "tragedy of the commons". It does however not prove that your assumption is correct in this case.

I did look at the code today how this is handled currently.
There is already a minimum output (0.00001 currently). Transactions with outputs below that limit will not be accepted by nodes. It can be defined by setting -minrelaytxfee. If the expected fee needed to redeem the output is higher than the output itself then the output is considered future "dust".
And there is already some rate limitation on transactions without fees. I do not recall the exact implementation but you can not send thousands of free transactions at once just because of coin age. However i think that this rate limitation is not in affect if more than minrelaytxfee is payed. It only affects transactions with less fees.

I really don't get why the full-RBF fans intentionally want to kill zeroconf.
If you look at the full-RBF patch it also includes that full nodes actively broadcast double-spends instead of ignoring them (what they are currently doing). The problem is, that with this change it will be completely trivial to go into a coffee shop, go out, click a button and have the transaction reverted. No constracts with miners or something. Every node will accept and broadcast this. With this change zeroconf is dead.
However without this patch you have to connect directly to miner. Have some shady contract with them, etc.
With the full-RBF patch the choice wether to accept zeroconf or not is taken from the user. I think this is a decicion a user should take. Maybe a coffee shop has no problem if 0,001% of its costumers perform double spends.

Yep. There is a difference between consensus rules and policy.
And btw. I found this
So you butters still exist? I probably will never understand why you are doing this.

I am not sure if the current situation ist really caused by coinwallet.eu.
The last tests failed miserably however this test is now going on for a while and at least it is "working". Also i did not read any announcement which they did the last 2 times and which is basically a must for someone who wants at least some kind of credibility.
Just my 2 cents.

Expedia.com also accepts bitcoin. I did already book a hotel 2 times with bitcoins. It felt really strange the first time I have to admit. Did also buy a ticket for a flight on cheapair.com. Also felt kind of strange when I was at the airport and the checkin went smooth (their reputation is not the best).
So i know how you feel. It simply works;)

Fun fact: He can safely destroy the keys for the receiving address of the genesis block. It can not be spend:

I did prepay the whole sum. Yes it was a bit of a risk. But it did work. I trust expedia.com enough. Cheapair was a bit of a risk.
