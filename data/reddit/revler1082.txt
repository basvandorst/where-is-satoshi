Range proofs aren't magical privacy dust. They're a component in hiding the amount being transacted. 
Additionally, having the base layer be transparent creates many issues for transparency a la Zcash. Privacy must be the default, otherwise your privacy relies on the opsec of others. 
And of course, this must be implemented as a hard fork if worked into the base layer, and that has it's own issues. 
I love Monero, but I'm a Bitcoin maximalist of sorts myself. Still, you obviously have no idea what you're talking about, so you shouldn't badmouth another coin from a position of ignorance.

Genuine question, why would someone choose Bitcoin over gold? Pros / Cons?

I don't see how a reasonable case can be made for never having a backwards incompatible software upgrade. This is security software! 
Sorry guys, we can't upgrade, we've got one guy still using IE 6 ...

I think that's the problem, people feel like that hard fork increase will never be delivered as evidenced by the last couple of years. It makes sense in that context to hold segwit hostage.

These analogies are dumb, and I couldn't finish reading the rest of your post if you really think going from 1 to 2 MB is comparable to round/flat Earth theories.
Compromise is not some dirty word, no matter how hard you try to sell that position. This whole situation is ridiculous when Core could've taken the wind out of the sails of all these movements with a small and probably safe increase.
We'll see how it plays out in the end, but he who doesn't bend, breaks.
 
Edit: meant to say provably* safe, on phone

Monero has scheduled hard forks every 6 months, which will eventually be extended as it matures, and may in the long long term come to an end completely. 
We are still in early days, this is the time to make protocol changes if there ever was one.
Thanks for your reasonable response btw, and not just calling me an idiot/troll/etc.

There is no evidence for this, or that Ver is single handedly responsible for all of the hash rate currently not signaling for Segwit.
Personal attacks and baseless accusations have made both subs toxic.

Would globee.com work?

You can't have it both ways, high fees, but also want someone making $2 a day to be able to run a node.
