If you run your own P2Pool instance, no. Some people run public P2Pool gateways that charge fees though. 
Added bonus, you get virgin coins that have never been spent or moved through a pool wallet, same as you would if you were solo mining. 
If you start mining on P2Pool do it for at least a couple of days before you compare your payouts with those made by centralized pools.

Download P2Pool from github, run it on a machine with a wallet, point miners at your new P2Pool node.
That's all there is to it. Can I have my Bitcoins now?  ;)

This. Small home connections will never be able to compete when big ISPs start dominating proof of bandwidth.

My gay neighbours in the tower across from my former apartment used to yell "Bing!" as they climaxed. Slap Slap Slap Slap Slap Slap "BING!" Slap Slap Slap "BING!" 
Closing the window didn't help. 
TL;DR BING

We could definitely do node classification based on network topology, latency, and total hash rate per netblock.
Miners wouldn't have to give up their identities to collude with each  other. A single public website with the instructions and goals is enough to get the ball rolling. Some form of block chain based voting and boom, command and control and the miners are colluding on a common goal anonymously. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 09:36:53
Yep. Or just make deals with other pool operators. 
Mine on P2Pool, damn it people! I really don't get why we bother with these giant centralized pools.

Go look at the sky. Perspective helped me.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:53:06
Don't want to wait? Point your miners at a public node that is already set up. It's a non-issue. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 17:38:19
Exactly.

The point is, as long as this runs over the public Internet, the existing power players will always be in a position to dominate "mining". 
So this project will be running to stand still. For years. It's hardly "taking power back from the man" or whatever. 
Who cares how decentralized something is if most nodes are run by big players? Why bother decentralizing in the first place? 
@_date: 2014-01-16 21:03:19
Exactly right.

Proof of Bandwidth is a dumb term. You actually mean Proof of Carriage, or Proof of Transit - prove that you relayed x bytes between Y and Z.
I've been working through this all morning and I haven't come up with a way to do this that could not be derailed by a malicious node.
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:47:54


Yes. Think 51% attack for bitcoin. Control a majority of nodes, you can warp things to suit yourself. If there is an advantage to owning a majority stake, collusion WILL happen. It's human nature.
There has to be a way of building a decentralized system that discourages consolidation of node ownership, or makes such consolidation worthless.

Nothing. This is a perfectly possible scenario. 
P2Pool, people. It takes half an hour to set up an instance, or you can just point your miners at someone else's. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 16:58:07
 
@_date: 2014-01-17 06:50:24
And if there's enough incentive to create malicious nodes, or for malicious nodes to collude, they will.

If you lose your wallet.dat, you will not go to space today. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:36:59
Could be an exchange wallet
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:09:32
P2Pool solves that.

For all we know, you are keeping a record of every private key you print and intend to sweep them into your own wallet at some point in the future. Or maybe someone at the manufacturing plant is doing the same.
It's important to acknowledge the possibility. We do have to trust you in order to use your product, and that's the big flaw.
No bitcoin user who cares about security should use bit-card products, or any paper wallet that they did not generate themselves on a computer that is not on the Internet. Paper wallets should always be printed on your own printer, never at a public one. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 00:55:29
Yep, that's why I stick to Firefox.
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:27:50
Developer synchronized the github repo just now. 
Looks good so far, checking.
Edit: I dug through this for a couple of hours and haven't found anything obviously missing. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:36:06
Have a look at Vault of Satoshi. They are a Canadian company. No CAD accounts yet but they are coming. Interface is great too. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:11:21
P2Pool gives you regular payouts and the coins are virgin too. The only reason a miner should use centralized pools is if their hash rate is too low to perform well on P2Pool.

Oh, right, I forgot about the shared asymmetric key stuff. Thanks for clarifying.
So we're back to trusting that you print what you say you'll print under the sticker. As a very paranoid person, I won't be buying your product - but it looks good!

I would like to see us refer to 1mBTC as one bitcoin, and what we call one bitcoin today to be referred to as one KiloBitcoin. 
That way people get to have whole bitcoins and pricing in bitcoin doesn't look weird. 
Yay metric. Move that decimal place!
