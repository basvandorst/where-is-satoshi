But the US government just gives them money and weapons, not individuals. Problem solved. No need for NSA.

What does the Y axis mean? I am having trouble understanding it. 
Does it mean that the purchasing power of the dollar was 10x more in 1910? That doesn't seem right.

Cheers, friend. Yup,  you're right, NDAA. Yeah I'm always worried bevause even with truecrypt or whatever similar thing they can always use brute force amd family coercion. It's a tough world out there but I love how the bitcoin community is innovating at such an incredible pace in spite of all the aforementioned junk. It gives me even more hope for an awesome future.

That's a cute statement. Taxes which fund governments are violent coercion so before you even take your first step you're forced into things you don't have choice in.
We're talking about a world with the PATRIOT Act and the NDA.
They constantly use the national security bullshit to take down totally unrelated financial activities. For all we know they could get arrested without trial indefinitely if someone made a questionable transaction with their service. Bleh

AKA Unconstitutionally collected via illegal wiretaps that break the 4th amendment to put shitloads of people into jail. Wonderful government, thanks for "protecting" us.

What's funny is socialists and communsts warn kf boom and busts. There are only "busts" with the other economic forms... I'd rather have booms and busts than only busts. Stupid logic.

It's always funny when they mention booms and busts. Other economic forms seem to only have busts. I'd rather have booms and busts than only busts.
