Warren Buffett is right that Bitcoin does not fulfill his investment philosophy but it does not mean that it is a bad investment.
15 years back even Amazon would not have fulfilled his investment philosophy and would be a 'gamble' as per his philosophy but that does not make Amazon a bad investment.
The way I and most other people view Bitcoin is that it is not a 100% guaranteed return opportunity but an investment where risk-adjusted return is very high. There is more than 10% chance bitcoin's value going up by more than 10 folds, 1% chance bitcoin's value going up 100 folds. Even if there is 80-90% chance bitcoin value going to near zero, Bitcoin value is significantly less than it's expected value in future.
EV = Sum of (ProbabilityXFuture Values) = 1%X1,000,000 +10%X100,000+89%X0 = $20,000
Given the risk-return odds in bitcoin it is advisable to invest an amount one is comfortable losing.
Also, Buffet's argument of how farms have value even if they are not traded and comparison with Bitcoin is flawed. Bitcoin has characteristics of commodity (gold) and currency which by it's inherent nature requires exchanging hands. If currency is not allowed to be exchanged, it is nothing more than a piece of paper.
If I had Billion dollars or even few millions to invest, I would completely follow Warren Buffett's risk-averse investment philosophy but unfortunately I do not have the millions to invest so a 10% annualized returns would make me rich in 10-20 years. But Bitcoin offers me a 10% chance to be rich or lose it all. I like the odds and want to take that 'gamble'!

As Bitcoin gains value, USD and other fiat currencies lose value. 
Question: Who are the people who will get effected the most after uncle Sam?
Answer: Billionaires who have their all their assets in USD or USD denominated assets. I am talking about people like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.
Warren Buffett has a conflict of interest when it comes to talking about Bitcoin since he will lose most if people convert USD to BTC!!

The right answer is you get paid in USD if you are in US. You get paid in Renminbi if you are in China. There is no if or but.
Stock options eventually convert to stock which converts to the national currency where the stock is listed.
Less than 0.01% transactions take place on dark website so that does not support your argument.

All of these numbers 1% or 10% or 50% are variable depending on each person's personal opinion. There is no right or wrong answer but there are right-ish and wrong-ish answers. 
Example of wrong-ish answers:
1. People (specially world renowned Economists) claiming with confidence that bitcoin will definitely be 0 in future. There is chance that Bitcoin may be 0 but it is not certain. 
2. People claiming with certainty that it will definitely be $1,000,000 soon. There is chance of this but again it is not certain.
The difference between these people and us is that we are humble enough to acknowledge that we do not know the future.

Why not AND. 
For Bitcoin to be world's No.1 currency efforts will be needed from all directions.

Never disputed occurrence of dark website transactions. Just questioned the volumes?
How many transactions in US do you think happen in any other currency than USD? I will be surprised even if you say 1%.

Yes professional gambling is a thing and it is separate from investing. There is world of a difference between investing and gambling. The big difference between two is the following:
1. Investing usually has very low risk while gambling has very high risk. Basket of stocks give good consistent returns in long term. Gambling generally has very binary returns.
2. Expected value in investing is more than the money you put in. In gambling expected value is lesser than the money you put in.
Using the first criteria Bitcoin (like any single stock) is closer to gambling. Using the second criteria personally I believe it is closer to investing with good risk-return profile.

USD/Euro are currencies backed by government people elect. These are de facto currency in which you get paid or pay your bills. When was the last time you though which currency to get your salary in? 
Thanks to the advent of crypto-currencies, soon people will be electing not just governments but also currencies. Bitcoin has the best technology, best minds and best chance to be the 'Number 1' currency of the future. Bitcoin should leverage economies of scale and strengthen it's brand.

Good point. There are two types of games - Games of chance and games of skill. 
Games of chance have expected value as negative and games of skill expected value varies on skill level. If someone is good at something and puts money on himself/herself then that person is not gambling but investing if he/she diversifies to play enough games (example playing 10,000 poker games of $1000 each) 
And not everyone who puts money in stocks is investing. Example someone doing leveraged trading on one tech stocks is gambling.
But still gambling is different than investing. Its not just what you play but how you play.

Buying one stock or few stocks is a gamble. But buying a diversified portfolio of stocks (&gt;15) and over a long period of time (E.g. putting in $1000 each month in 15 stocks for 10 years) is not at all gambling. This strategy gives a decent returns (~10%) in long term with very little risk. 
But comparing this strategy with Bitcoin is unfair since Bitcoin is giving stellar returns (&gt;100%) in last several years and justifies having a higher risk.

Different people get into Bitcoin for different reasons.
A common man wants to put their money where there is safety, security and permanence. Western banks have traditionally wanted to express their values of safety, permanence and wealth by building and usually owning massive buildings. 
Also, this will be a message to institutional investors using decentralized funding model that this decentralized currency is here to stay!!

So that it becomes so mainstream that I don't have to sell it for fiat ever..
Also, so that it goes into so many hands that it becomes difficult for government to ban Bitcoin ever..

Investing if done properly is nowhere close to gambling. It is a profession like any other profession (like medicine). People like Warren Buffett are masters in this. 
If you could find 10+ opportunities (uncorrelated to BTC) having risk-return profile of Bitcoin and invested fixed amount each month in each of these opportunities. It would be deemed as investing. Unfortunately there are not too many such opportunities for retail investors.

Putting money is a different currency that you do not currently use for day to day activities is investing since you expect it to be worth more (or have more buying power) in the future .

My friend please tell me one gambling opportunity where expected value is more than 0. I can give you specific examples where expected value is negative - Game of Roulette 
If gambling's expected value was not negative casinos would have been losing money and not making money despite huge overheads.
