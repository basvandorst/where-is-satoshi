$169-$199 is a pretty expensive option

I suppose in theory you would be spreading the perceived ownership from a single individual to however many m of n keys are required to move the funds. However it's not mixing because you know that within that group of m people, one of them has has either total control of the funds (if they own the remaining keys) or the group collectively has control of the keys. Ideally in mixing, you would not be able to pinpoint such a narrow group.

You never technically have complete control over a transaction leaving your Coinbase account regardless of what address it is sent to. Once the transaction is broadcast to the blockchain it's a waiting game for confirmations to start

I think you guys are one of, if not the, best crypto news currency sites. Quick to respond to community inquiries and don't stoop to click bait links. I've seen tons of stories that are a result of your journalism investigations that would otherwise not be heard about. Just wanted to let you know your doing a fantastic job

Import the private key to the linux machine at your work. However I'm not sure you want this if you'll be making transactions out of both at different periods.

Even though Mycelium is very reputable (I use them as my mobile phone hot wallet) you don't know if there's anything else on your phone that could have in some way intercepted the private key after/while it was being entered. 
If a truly random number generator was used to create your private key, entering it anywhere would be the first time that it was seen in the real world aside from when it was generated offline. Generating it on a dedicated offline computer is infinity more secure than exposing it in any way to an online device (mycelium on your phone)
So, even though the private key may still be on the offline computer (if you haven't deleted it or reformatted the hard drive) it would be considered insecure because of it's exposure to an online device.

When he said this he knew that the panic sell in the bonds market was literally based on completely wrong news. He knew the correct news and that's why he was so astute to buy up the cheap bonds. 
Not saying it's wrong it's just that the context is often misrepresented

Wouldn't someone be able to scan a bunch of the cards while they were on the shelf at the store and, as soon as they say a balance appear on that address, import it into their own wallet? 
I guess I don't understand the whole 'the app will automatically input the verification code'  if their is no phone number associated with the card at the time of purchase to verify who has rights to import vs who doesnt.

Wouldn't you be able to record the nonce for found blocks and literally mine by hand after going back in time since you know what the exact answers to the next blocks would be?

What he should really consider is who has more to offer in terms of scarcity and demand for their skillset. You couldnt count on two hands the number of people with the technical know how that mike hearn has. I have a feeling that that is part of the reason theymos is so stubborn, his control over significant communication channels is the only thing that makes him "important" in the bitcoin ecosystem.

I think it was a quote from someone that people were making fun of because the inception of the internet was less than 50 years ago, making "the history of the world" statement just sound overly dramatic. Either way, it's a bad idea to have inside jokes like that on a website that is frequented primarily by bitcoin newcomers.

If you mine Bitcoin using a pool, you have an address associated with the miner for the mining rewards (aka Bitcoin) to be sent to. I'm not sure if it would even be possible to find the person who controls the miner if they setup their mining pool account anonymously using a combination of TOR,TAILS, and a VPN (paid for using BTC)

If someone buys a 21inc miner I find it highly unlikely that that will be the end of their bitcoin education. There are tons of people who think the internet is only accessable via wifi. The 21inc miner lets newcomers dabble if they want without experiencing the setup frustration that may otherwise put them off to learning about bitcoin. The price is high currently but cheaper future models will be excellent for new users

I actually really dislike the t shirt design. I was under the impression it would be something simple, like their logo, not a terrible graphic of your arms handcuffed behind you and a horrible play on words on the front....the usb is awesome but i would have never opted to get the t shirt had i known it would look like this.
