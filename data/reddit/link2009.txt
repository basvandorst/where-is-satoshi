Kim Dotcom is still not in jail so it has worked out pretty well for him.

This sounds like such a corporate message that was paid for...Jesus, I knew why I stopped coming to this subreddit.

Sorry bud, this story is nothing about having balls, it's about being naive and not knowing how to prioritize your life. You cashed our your retirement funds to gamble all of your money. 
You sound like a complete naive gambler to me and I hope your girlfriend learned a very important lesson from this experience.

You invested your savings? Are you mentally impaired?

Weird...I could have sworn he edited his post. Before it said 'I have a five figure sum in MtGox'.

Is this the first time you've ever visited Mt. Gox?
They've always had a JS redirect to prevent DDoSing. Don't upvote this guy.

There's nothing calculated about what you described.
You CANNOT time the market.
Nobody knows when Bitcoin peaked or will peak.
Putting all (or most) of your eggs in one basket is completely naive and "dumb".
Selling a few hours before the bubble crashes is called LUCK, it's not educated, informed or calculated.
I think you should really evaluate your decisions and your life to avoid big mistakes in the future that could put your entire life in jeopardy.
I'm a startup guy too and very young so I have the "option" to risk it all but luckily I can put my selfish needs away in the present to build a "decent" life for myself and my family in the future.

Wow, the Bitcoin community has sunk so low that it needs to convince 14 year old to 'invest' their parents' money into the Pyra- I mean Bitcoin Scheme.
I'm ashamed to be a part of this community.
