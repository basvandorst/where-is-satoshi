I meant exchanges get hacked.

Right now banks offer complete security. Bitcoin does not as there are far too many instances of hacking or exchanges shutting down accounts, and the transactions are not cheap or fast. Bitcoin still cannot match the services offered by banks and is still far off. How far off exactly, I don't know - bitcoin has been around for about a decade and still not caught up.

[Here is one with 1% interest]( I'm in Canada so bear with me.
[Here is a GIC (guaranteed investment certificate) that pays 2.75%-25% over five years, so your principal is guaranteed (again - zero risk investment).](

Putting your money into a savings account has no volatility nor risk except inflation. By that logic, no one should use savings account ever and all money should be in the stock market. Also usually if you have a minimum amount in your account, all fees are waived. Plus you make interest to compensate for inflation.

Yes, because you make interest. There are also investments like bonds which are zero-risk that pay interest.

Inflation is 1-2% a year and a high-interest savings is usually about that. It may vary by country.
Besides that, you can also buy bonds. Those are also zero-risk. They usually pay 3-5% but depending on the terms you may need to lock in your money for minimum time (no problem if you are saving long-term, similar to bitcoin).

I mean day trading is still possible, you would get taxed but there is still profit.
