This Stupify asshole really grinds the shit out of my gears.

Why can nobody use the phrase "Food for thought" correctly?

Better write down that wallet with .04 left in it...

When the price does not go up, it means that the supply of bitcoins is equal to the need for bitcoins. When the price goes up sharply, it stands to reason that bitcoins are more valuable to people in general, and that these people place merit in the currency. It shows interest and growth with a price rise, and pleases early adopters.

You really are the man - I don't think anyone else on Reddit has generated as much interest in BTC as you have. Happy tipping!

The $2100 I invested was disposable money I wasn't using, and that's how it should be. All that ends up mattering is the best fit line, and in the end none of the peaks and valleys matter for shit. If it had gone to $0, I would have said "well, that risk didn't work" and moved on. I don't need to write an article about it.

I payed 200% of the price for the hassle of trust.

That made me laugh.
I don't use VirWoX much but I just needed the mining fees for quick confirmations. I had the exact amount in my wallet and couldn't wait 24 hours.
Thanks for Liqpay though.

Even at the most outrageous estimates for BTC, the value of 1 BTC never crosses the line where you'd need to deal in nanoBTC.

I bought 500 @ $4.25, so I technically "lost" ($160x500) = $80,000 in the crash. However, I'm still up $45,000 from when I bought in.

It really is a unique opportunity that I love. I don't have to keep every cent invested and untouched for fear of rises and falls, I can use it whenever I want, and half the time I get discounts for using it.

Just telling it how it is. I love seeing one of your tips and someone else saying "What just happened here?" I understand why you do it :P
I'll be paying it forward!

A very cool talk (I'm about 15 minutes in now), glad you went out and gave a different perspective than many others who delved into the technical aspects. I actually arranged an agreement with my freelance psychologist to pay in Bitcoins. 3 months later, she now advertises her Bitcoin acceptance policy and even offers a 10% discount for those who do! Accepting Bitcoins is now becoming a way to get more business, and I'm glad to see someone else delve into it the same way.
