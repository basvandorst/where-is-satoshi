Come on people the writing is on the wall Frypto's (fiat cryptos) will come and each transaction will be taxed. The easiest way to get a one world order and one world coin is to get those who hate you to build it for you. Just wait until the infrastructure is up and running. 
We are being duped. Why do you think it has been allowed to go this far. 
After the Frypto's and one world coin comes 
RFID chips inserted into anyone who wants to access any financial service. 
We are screwed.

@_date: 2018-03-14 09:22:26

@_date: 2018-02-02 21:02:37

Let's have an audit on gold certificates v actual gold. This shit is happening everywhere. If the world did a proper audit on itself usdt would be looking sweet

Maybe a vote on what word should be used.considering it will be the stepping stone towards the “one world coin” it deserves a name

Meh. For me it doesn't really matter.  I'm more interested in what the USD is backed by. They just keep printing the shit like there is no tomorrow. What is any fiat backed by?. Before you say it's back by the government, so what. Have a look at Zimbabwe

The Fryptos (fiat cryptos) are coming. I predict a tax on every transactions using Fryptos and this will replace income tax
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:29:09
Which part?
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:26:46
Ebtc has only 21million and comes without all the forks   
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:46:22
No apparently if you forked gold, a magic leprechaun pops up and you end up with double the gold you started with.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:39:19
Which bitcoin? I don't see three different versions of gold
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:18:21
Like what is happening now?
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:15:33
The first Frypto (fiat crypto). There will be more as the world moves towards a digitalised one world currency. It's been the plan all along. 
We will get to the stage where you will not be able to access services without using the taxed one world Frypto. Predicted 30 years ago for 2018.
