Seriously? Why the hate? I live in AZ and it's an amazing place to live. As evidenced by the growth rate. Why don't you keep your hatefulness to yourself?

Please excuse me for being ignorant here but I'm trying to understand this. According to [bitcoinfees.info]( the current average per transaction cost is $2.46? They are assuming a 250 byte sized transactions with that quote. If that is true, how did your transaction only cost 13 cents? Was your transaction only 13 bytes in size? That seems impossible.

Thanks for sticking with me on that. Ha! Appreciate it. I think I got it now.

In the strict sense of the word, you are correct. However, nation states that have over 50% of their GDP generated by government and have significant cradle to grave safety nets and unions that control every aspect of employment... that is as close to expensive and reckless socialism as we'll get without getting China or Venezuela type socialism. In other words, ALL OF THAT is why your taxes and cost of living are so high.

I guess this is where my confusion lies. According to bitcoinfee.info, it would be $9.84 for 1000 byte transaction. ($2.46 per 250 bytes). So 100 bytes would be around .98, not .13. So I'm still not following the math I guess.

Socialism is expensive. The nanny state is like a voracious, money eating tiger.

How much were the fees and how long did the transaction take?
