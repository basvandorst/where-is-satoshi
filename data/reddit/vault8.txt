Since we are new to reddit and were asked to join by other users we wanted to address what we do and our services and latest news. As pertaining to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
Vault8 was built from the ground up, not an open source project like php etc. We are not an “off the shelf application” like 80&amp; of the crypto market today. Our application is patent pending. We offer unique services that no other company offers for bitcoin holders, miners and others. 
Our online presence is a simple information website and backend application. It is just a management tool, if someone tries to hack into it they get nothing. Our database is offline.  
We are not a wallet, exchange, buyer, seller or escrow of bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies but we have some of the features of all of them. 
We are the only service that allows a box holder to transfer and receive bitcoin without risk. Account holders can deposit bitcoin in and withdraw the value in cash anywhere in the world if they want. A wallet does not offer that, an exchange requires all your personal information and there are limits. We require no personal information and there are no limits. Account holders can give temp access to their boxes so a lender or buyer can see their bitcoin holdings are real and place a hold on them.
In the end of our 30 day beta period, we now have over $400M USD in bitcoin deposits. Setup a free account. Take a look around at all the services that we offer.  Then talk to us if you have other questions so you can make an informed decision and comment and then add to our discussion of how we can make it better.
We are a virtual company like 100 of the top 500 companies are moving towards. Let’s Talk. Want to talk, services, tech, bitcoin or anything else. You can Call, email or text us directly. You can use the online chat and support on our website.  Visit us on twitter, ask questions there. All our contact information is found on our website.
