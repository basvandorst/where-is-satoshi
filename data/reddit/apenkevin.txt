@_date: 2017-11-15 11:28:31

There was a dip in the previous week aswell where it dropped to 4300 euro's but had no fiat to buy them 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:39:53
I really hope people listen to this and sold for profit

Each fraction of a bitcoin you own gives you the same amount on the Segwit 2x coin and 1 Segwit coin is going for 1100 now

He is the founder of LTC
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:37:02
Yeah nothing feels worse than knowing you have to sell at a loss
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:54:34
No not even a its over 9000 joke?
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:25:49

@_date: 2017-11-19 18:27:32
It means how many coins have been traded in a time span of 24 hours on that platform
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:59:07
Why aren't you naked?
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:51:39
You can choose to keep them or trade them just like bitcoin. Their current value can be seen here  but no one knows what it will look like in a few days
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:03:44
Remember its crypto it can go both ways no one is able to predict the future so make sure you dont spend more then you can lose
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:18:59
It was 2000 earlier today
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:58:39
Make sure to get one of those cookies aswell!

@_date: 2017-11-05 13:50:05
Its sunday it always seems to go up on sunday
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:58:43
Dont think there is a dip coming anymore before the fork if the amazon rumors are true the price is going to skyrocket and we might never see these prices again
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:56:36
What goes up has to go down so lets hope for one more good dip before the fork
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:13:48
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:15:18
Its going to dip it would be logical for it to do so take your profit and rebuy in the dip
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:44:45
Do not regret be happy with what you get
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:55:01
Things to ask yourself
1. Do you believe in new technology 
2. Do you want to make money
If your answers are yes its worth it
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:41:15
TL DR:
The amount of bitcoins you own stay the same but you get free shitcoins equal to the amount of bitcoins you have when the fork takes place
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:00:20
Look into it to long to explain just basic knowledge after a while of trading its at 6,5k euro's now if we break this wall its going to stop at 6,7k thats where the next wall is
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:57:19
No but i do have a bike?
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:59:41
Honestly im just trying to build up my balance so i can consider investing in other stocks i've kept track of it the last few days and it seems like lately its been pretty good for day trading
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:31:52
Would be a true christmas miracle
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:13:51
Lets just hope it follows the pattern from previous weeks where mid week there is a dip and at the end of the week there is a ATH
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:55:34
What are the predictions for now considering there is a limited amount of bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:16:24
Well looks like im going to work at McDonalds again
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:00:36
Is it not worth trying either? Like how are you going to get good at it if you dont try
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:41:03
It does you can use credit card to add to your coinbase euro wallet and transfer your euro's to the gdax euro wallet since its under the same company you can transfer it for free
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:14:13
Yeah just choose "Coinbase account" and it should say how much you have on your coinbase account just transfer it over to GDAX
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:50:49
They posted something earlier saying you will get both but it may take a while
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:06:52
Oh well that sounds less promising than i had in mind
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:13:02
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:55:14
You should try GDAX instead its a company from Coinbase aswell but the buying fees are lower and if you do some studying you can use the "market" option aswell where you pay 0% fee
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:53:39
Pretty sure russia banning it plays a role and just a logical drop since it grew so much lately
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:58:00
Yeah but what if you consider holding it if you do not make profit off it at the end of the day?
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:11:32
Any advice if i should invest in to them now?
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:27:23
But considering there is a limited amount of bitcoins left wouldnt it make sense for it to increase? Or is it really unpredictable

Go to Gdax.com and login with your Coinbase account once you logged in it should say at the top right "Deposit" It is going to give you the option of: Sepa/Coinbase Account/Bitcoin address so you just choose Coinbase account and it should show you "Source" just select Eur wallet and it should show you the amount of money you currently have in your Coinbase account just deposit that on to GDAX (Should be instant) and buy from GDAX! If you got any questions feel free to ask them
Edit: Actually I'm not sure if this works but i saw this earlier on a reddit post
