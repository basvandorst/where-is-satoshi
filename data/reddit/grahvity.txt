N &amp; S Korea? I'm not sure if this is a geography-related thing or political but you have my attention.
Forgive me, I'm an American.

well, AMA about bitcoin.
If you're still up for another question, what do I have to learn in order to operate a trading bot.  Not a high-frequency type, just something that will bounce a couple of coins around while I sleep.
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:31:27
Thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2013-04-02 23:53:32
Hopefully, this becomes huge. And not a bad way of spreading the word too.

Very nicely indeed. Thanks.

Not only did I like your rhyme but I could identify with how much time you have to put in to earn BTC by doing that web stuff.
There's a service that gets you to Google someone's name and provide hits on positive stories about them in an effort to bury bad press. They don't tell you that that's what you're doing but I dug up one guy's name, he was a physician of some kind who was accused of 'misconduct' with one of his patients. There weren't any charges filed against him but the story was there in the news.  I would shit bricks if all the time I spend doing that was for nothing.
PM me when you get your wallet straightened away. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:56:23
Thank you kindly.

Stronger now than before the break. Titanium, bitches!


Probably not. I kind of lost interest in it and there would be too much nueropathic pain.

WOAH. THANKS!

The price needs to stabilize first before people will feel confident paying for products and services with bitcoins en mass. I don't want to own a $8000 T-shirt.

Remember that pressing the report button does nothing if you don't also message the moderators too with the appropriate link in your post.

I look forward to the day that we can tip the comments in a hugely popular IAMA with "verify" and have bitcointipbot reply, raising awareness to the multitudes.

I like to think of the analogy of car accelerating. Investors are dumping money into bitcoin right now the tires are gripping the road and the car is gaining speed exponentially. There'll be a point where the amount of new investments begins to taper off and the price of bitcoin will stabilize and our car will be moving at, more or less, a constant velocity.

That and the additional fire hazard in your home. You have to admit it's pretty cool.

I just wanted to say that I appreciated this post very much. I learned more tonight than I have in the last month, probably longer. I also wanted to get a chance to test out this nifty little tipping bot. You deserve more than what I have in it right now.

This reminds me of those old news broadcasts of Tom Brokaw reporting on this new thing called the World Wide Web.
This one's a classic: 
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:33:10
The bot's verification doesn't appear in other non-btc subreddits making our tip/comment seem a bit odd instead of informative or enticing.

It's simply puts a red tag next to the post in the mod queue.  As a moderator, I don't know that anything's been reported unless I look in the queue or someone messages me and tells me to look for it. If you message me, then my little moderator alien turns red and I see your message and hopefully it contains which link has been reported so I can go straight to it and deal with it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:07:38
One of the better things I've read in this sub in a couple of days. May your investment continue to multiply. I'm tagging you in RES "watches videos for btc" so I can tip you when bitcointip is up again.

I plan to cut out all the walking and nodding part. No doubt you'll see it in comments to come.

Not being a programmer is mining possible for me or will I soon find myself over my head? (I understand the costs have to be calculated)
To clarify: is it as simple as buying an ASIC from BFL, downloading a program, and joining a pool or is there more to it than just that?

 I too stared for a while at that cent symbol and reminisced. One more thing I have to Google, copy/paste in order to type into a sentence.

Thanks. I'll work on it some other time and no doubt you'll see it.
