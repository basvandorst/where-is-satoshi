Awesome! Any chance you could a litecoin version? The more crypto themes the better imo.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:10:20
Or we'll have moved onto to another crypto which won't let this become a problem, cough litecoin cough, DOWNVOTES! wooooo!
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:20:19
ok perfect post, i've always wondered, how do you USE this script? Is it just inside a &lt;script&gt; tag like any old script or do I need to hookup json like I do jquery?
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:17:50
Damn you are quick haha I already see the logo fix, gj man. Wish I had the programming knowledge to do a project like that.
edit: also I dunno if this is a matter of taste or not but perhaps you could add "SteamerLoader.com into the Logo as to help make people remember it more easily?
And as far as extra info goes; not sure if this helps or not 
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:44:55
Calm yourself its a temporary landing page and im already in bed. I have alot to add.
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:40:21
i like you. have an up vote. :p
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:31:30
Also taking any suggestions on site design, sticker designs, future sticker designs or anything else!

He can get 1 ltc pretty easily from btce if he has btc already. AND RUMOR HAS IT MT GOX IS WORKING ON SELLING LTC. ACHEM. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:54:14
Thanks! I aimed for something simpler due to the fact that the QR Code versions were intended to be customizable and didn't want some confusing .PSD full of layers.
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:06:42
its not meant to be scanned haha
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:44:45
There's a chance they regulate it as a commodity tbh, but we'll have to wait and see.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:10:33
lol Just set him up a 2 LTC wallet then so he can watch his money quintuple in the next few weeks. That'll get him excited for sure. Should only cost like .05 BTC or something.
Edit; Maybe have him read up on LTC, seeing as it does have differences from LTC, it might really help him understand cryptos better.
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:53:07
litecoin lol
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:51:23
Hell you might as well toss a little donate icon for yourself somewhere since this is basically a non profit :p
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:23:42
We'll hopefully have more than 1 currency seeing as bitcoin would be like spending the big bills on things like a cheeseburger, litecoin is more fit for smaller, quicker transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:25:40
Care to share it?
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:07:20
I love it. Totally bookmarked for when I get out of my saving stage of BTC. Will definitely pass this along as well. Althought I would be inclined to see some sort of "proof of authorization" from steam just because alot of Bitcoin sites tend to require a leap of faith on the consumers end. Something like that would really help you out imo.
Edit: 
Also here are some minor things you might want to alter just to make it a little better.
* - I should be able to click the logo and go back to the main page to choose a different package.
*Maybe feature the bitcoin prices somewhere more prominent then the footer?
*Feature your gamer profile more prominently as well? These are valuable resources that give you validity and should be alot more obvious.
*the home icon in the footer takes me o a whole another website, this should take you home and you should text link your main website in the footer instead, its very confusing.
*add some more Bitcoin related info, maybe add a page with valuable Bitcoin related info? A lot of people who don't have a way to fund steam might find this useful, but might be worried about the learning curve. Help them out a bit.
Thats just my 2 cents.
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:36:08
90% of the world has no clue, nor cares what BTC is, same idea. But its alright keep your majority, im cool with that.
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:41:28
people get all antsy when talking about litecoins in the BTC subs for sub reason. The majority of any group seems to have this us vs them mentality for some reason.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:53:06
Please dont throw out false information.  There is quite a bit different between ltc and btc
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:02:32
bitvisitor.com but imo its not worth it. You'd be better off just buying 20 bucks in BTC each time you can. Or working for it if you can find someone willing to pay you for your skills.
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:34:48
Sounds like a good idea to me.  Want some free sticker designs to save on costs? I just made  where I host free printshop ready die cut sticker designs for exactly this purpose. Give em out to merchants
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:17:12
whoa whoa whoa, info please?
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:03:58
Seeing as i'm capped at spending $100 a week, I have no idea. Sorry.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:50:17
Lucky me? I get cheap coins again. This hasn't phased me mainly because it was expected. Watch the media blowup over this and at the end of the day all they are going to do is drive the price back up in a few weeks... 
@_date: 2013-11-15 07:47:30
coinbase.com will be your best bet if you are in USA. You can buy as much as you'd like but you're first purchase will take 5-9 days top verify so don't go test buy 10 bucks or anything haha
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:16:20
even though here come the downvotes, Litecoin seems like the most viable, the creator even works for Coinbase and his brother runs BTCChina or something along those lines. He even checks in on the subreddit for LTC lol. Its holding steady at $30 this past week.
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:55:42
1. Mining is mainly done by CPUs, unlike with BTC.
2. Instead of simply having SHA security, there is SHA + Scrypt, which adds a tremendous amount to the integrity of the currency.
3. Litecoin will produce 4x amount of coins in half the time, which in theory will be better for daily usage.
4. The approval times for transactions is roughly 2 minutes compared to BTC's 10 minutes. Might or might not be a good thing, we don't know for sure yet. But this in theory will also be better for daily use in say a brick and mortar store where people don't want to be forced into a service like bitpay but also cant afford customers waiting around 10-20 minutes for  network approvals.
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:23:58
good thing its just a t-shirt design ;]
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:31:51
You'll be happy you did, I promise.
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:15:32
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:35:35
Lol anyone who mentions LTC in BTC threads gets downvoted. Thats cool. We'll see whos laughing when you guys come back and read this quote when LTC hits $50.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:07:35
keep reporting these posts.
edit: and tell your friends and family! Pay someone back in BTC, or simply just go post on Facebook about it. Anything helps. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:51:42
you should take some of that btc and get a few ltc here and there too. There is no way one crypto will be all we have at our disposal.  
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:48:49
you guys are both sadly uninformed, anyone who understands bitcoin at all completely expected everything thats happened today and yesterday. Everything. This is going to be a slow uphill battle, but technology will prevail one way or another.
... i hope. :]
edit: come back in 2 months, bet he'll be "winning" again.... lol
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:12:10
Lol true I guess, obviously pay them back AFTER they have become interested through you introducing it, if they agree haha.
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:29:34
Someone PM'ed me about possibly setting my site up to be able to process orders through a printshop, i'll keep you posted, also can you PM me your mailing address so I can get your checked in to my excel spreadsheet for the time being? Thanks a shit-ton by the way, I will be ordering my personal batch next week and will mail you 10 bucks worth which should be at least 4-5 stickers. Depending on the size of my order.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:25:12
hey bro, google litecoins, heres chance  for you. Don't fuck it up again.
edit: rumor has it LTC will jump to $50 in the coming weeks. its at $10 now.
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:18:31
Lol sorry I mistyped its 2 inches ill fix it now.
