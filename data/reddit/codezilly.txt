What's cool about using PayPal is that after you get the coins, you can dispute it and get your fiat back.
For the same reason, people don't sell crypto via PayPal.

It's a waiting period while your USD transaction clears the bank. I'm assuming you did an ACH deposit, and those do not clear in real time. There is potential for ACH transfers to bounce for up to 7 days or so, so they need to see the USD finalized before releasing your BTC. Wire transfers and debit card payments are not subject to this, for future reference.

You can’t mine Bitcoin with a GPU at a profit. You probably can’t even get a share submitted before it’s stale, and you’d be operating at a loss if you could.
What you CAN do is mine various alt coins, and exchange them for BTC. For this, you should check out whattomine.com to compare coin profitability. You can also do the same by mining to NiceHash: rent your hashpower to others and get paid in BTC.

This is income. If you cash out now for 1 BTC at $6700, then convert to fiat when BTC is $10,000 - you would then owe capital gains on your $3300 gain.

As a global or even national currency, it would prevent war due to the cost. America prints the money it needs to fund war. If we couldn't do that, we couldn't do what we're doing around the world. You can only spend what you have, and our wars are only possible with fiat money.
We also tend to attack countries that don't adopt central banking. Look at Lybia.
@_date: 2018-05-09 19:02:37
I’m talking about the outside world, not inside your country. I’d imagine that a small percentage of bitcoin is already in Iran, which means Iranians need to get more of it from outside Iran if Iran wants their economy to function with it. 
Additionally, what country is going to trade goods with Iran, regardless of whether it’s traded in Bitcoin? Just because Bitcoin makes violating sanctions easier doesn’t make it smart. The US (Trump) isn’t fucking around.

Weed stockholders are going to be massive bag holders. 
It’s a saturated market with a dark cloud hanging over it. In Washington, margins are pretty thin in the cannabis industry. Many cannabis businesses have sold recently for enormous sums, because the state is not granting new licenses. Buyers aren’t doing proper due diligence and will never recoup their principle. 
Many of the early entrepreneurs in this state are either already out, or preparing to get out. Someone very close to me is one of the biggest players in WA and I’ve been told things I know to be protected under NDA, so can’t repeat here. But smart people are glad to be out, or can’t wait to be. 
And this is all assuming Jeff Sessions doesn’t get crazy. If that little fucker follows through on his words, the industry will collapse overnight.

If your card issuer is already blocking bigger merchants like Coinbase, I’d say enjoy it while it lasts. I’d imagine the credit card companies will begin blocking this merchant, just as they do with others. Some card issuers may still allow it, but charge cash advance interest rates. I’d also be sure your cardholder agreement hasn’t been updated to restrict crypto.

I agree that Bitcoin makes all of this possible. There are two points I’m making:
1) the value of bitcoin in Iran is going up because there’s very little bitcoin in Iran, so the demand right now is greater than supply. 
2) other countries, for the most part, will still refuse to deal with Iran, because of the consequences the US would impose if it came to light.

On the bright side I've now got about 125k in home equity in an area that's in a housing crisis (fastest rising rent in the USA over last 12 months). Even with my good living situation, can't get over it. I'll probably never get over it. Unless Bitcoin dies. And that won't happen.

I loved how Mr Robot has included every aspect of bitcoin in 2nd / 3rd seasons... from their version of Silk Road to what’s laid out in this clip... and of course we still don’t know about White Rose’s machine and plans for the Congo... taking over mining maybe? Such a good show!
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:19:27
This has little/nothing to do with bitcoin. Fiat based online gambling has been around for decades. As for online casino games, there are many that have had their RNG certified by reputable third parties. Even that’s shaky compared to a live game. The fact you played in bitcoin makes me wonder if you were even using a “reputable” site, or an unscrupulous one. 
And let’s be honest, blackjack didn’t just find you... you found blackjack.

Define “get away.”
I wouldn’t advise it in any circumstance, but consider:
If you work for a random company in the private sector, the worst outcome is realistically termination.
If you work for the government or a financial institution, you might end up like this guy.
If this guy was mining on some CPUs he wouldn’t have been caught, and if he was still, probably wouldn’t be facing charges. He did credit card fraud and racked up the power bill on top. That’s all I’m saying.

I have heard that VPN users have had their Coinbase accounts closed. That said, I have used mine through a VPN without issues. No particular reason I was using it relating to Coinbase, I just use vpn when on public WiFi.

Sounds like you’re asking if your GPU would be negatively affected. The answer is no, as long as your card has proper cooling.
