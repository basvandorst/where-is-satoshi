Thanks! Hope you can make it, if not May 1 then sometime in the future!

The bars that still accept bitcoin know to split the food from the alcohol. I have a feeling I may know which establishment you had an issue in as far as staff training, please PM me the name so I can address this issue with the owner. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:17:59
This is a very interesting angle and I will bring this up. These merchants are all converting 100% USD.
I will keep you posted and thank out for your insight!
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:17:52
We are drumming up ideas for phase 2...using this as a proof of concept to gauge interest. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 19:22:33
That is a main reason why I am a supporter of merchant adoption, even if the merchants are settling in USD. This encourages non-bitcoiners in our communities to learn more about the technology and realize that there is much more to it than what we often see sensationalized at arms length in the news.

Disobey, anonymous caller makes call to agency, liquor license is lost as is family business. 
These anonymous calls happen all the time for other violations. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 12:46:54
Not necessary, but not a bad idea to at least set up something for those who wish to donate. 
Here is an address i set up, feel free to ask for proof that its me (Nikhil) if you need. I will send any accumulated funds to his BitPay site so he can receive it. 
I will also see if I can get the public BitPay checkout website URL for SweetieFry, that way people can just "check-out" a transaction themselves directly to them. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:26:10
I hope you are not advocating businesses in accepting Bitcoin. Ignoring government regulations that dictate one's business can kill one's business, wreak havoc to one's family, and immeasurable other horrible consequences. 
Losing a liquor license is far more a concern for these businesses than accepting Bitcoin. No one wants to go to court in the first place. They all support Bitcoin, and want to be a part of the Bitcoin community - this is their way, and it is very important Bitcoin not be the straw that fails their business. 
@_date: 2014-08-26 14:10:50
wow, yeah that was a while ago! Well, if you can get here between October 3, we have some exciting stuff happening...
Many more details to come. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:39:10
I have included them in this conversation. I also explained the Bitpay process up the agency. 
He said to me: "if a Canadian came here and wanted to use thier cash to pay, you wouldn't allow that". My response was "no, but I would allow them to use their Canadian credit card and have their bank do the conversion"
He said "oh yeah, I guess you have answers for everything". 
It was actually a very positive conversation, with a bad result. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 11:19:38
We will be there! Please reach out! 
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:23:57
Well, yeah you would have to take precautions as you would any open WiFi. They are password protected so not completely opened, but any customer can get on if they ask the counter staff. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 18:14:42
Which Bitcoin Boulevard people would these have been? In fact, the boulevard has been incredibly successful. Each business has seen increased sales, more than expected. We never expected much, that was clear from the beginning - no one expected a windfall. 
The fact that they *are* seeing revenues has been very exciting for everyone. 
Revenues were not the only reasons these business owners chose to participate in this Bitcoin project. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:04:36
Thank you for your support! I am not a lawyer either, but many will be at our event. I actually look forward to this challenge. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 11:18:07
Not sure about that comment, that is not from one of our merchants. That does not really seem like a valid position. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:48:09
This was explained to the agency, but I plan on highlighting this more aggressively when I call today. They all use BitPay and plan on 100% conversions, except for 1 bar who wanted to keep in BTC. I'm sure he would be OK switching to USD if that was the compromise. 
This is actually a state matter, the feds are the ones who don't care. Our state liquor laws are crazy. No barter, no coupons, no free drinks, no gift cards in many cases. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 22:31:29
So far. We have made a lot of progress on this, and I will be updating the site soon with an update. It is the top priority for us right now. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:30:11
Thanks! It was a really fun day of filming. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:29:10
We are using BitPay and receiving 100% USD. The State made their decision without this information. We have sent updated info to the State, including a statement from BitPay and they is reevaluating as we speak. 
We see this no different than accepting an international credit card. Hoping for positive results as the regulators learn more about Bitcoin payment processing too. Education and awareness was a primary goal for us, and that includes for regulators as well. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:22:36
Ha, must have been a while since someone paid in Bitcoin. They were probably pretty bummed though. I'll stop there and add the payment checkout site to their iMac too. 
Thanks so much for stopping by though, and I am glad to hear about your Sweetie Fry experience!
@_date: 2014-04-18 20:19:05
Thank you for your support! Please consider joining us on May 1st. The Cleveland Bitcoin Meetup will host its official kickoff for this event at 6pm at The Wine Spot.
@_date: 2014-09-16 22:28:01
Thank you! There are some great things happening in Ohio, especially in and around Cleveland. Reach out if you ever find yourself this way. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 13:05:30
The spirit behind this type of project is not just to generate BTC sales, although it is fun when it happens. It is so much more than that. It is also to increase brand awareness, to make a statement about banking, to embrace emerging technologies, to stimulate new conversations, and the list goes on. BTC sales may be low, but that is expected (at least at our Bitcoin Boulevard US). Yet, this has created exciting opportunities which we never imagined. 
While BTC sales may be low, the community awareness and chatter about this initiative will draw customers nonetheless - even if they use cash or credit card, this is still a win for small business. It is also a HUGE win for Bitcoin. I would bet, like our Boulevard, many (if not all) of these merchants are not native Bitcoiners - simply businesspersons trying out a new form of strategy. Bitcoin is a payment *option*, not a requirement. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:20:38
Thank you for the support. Once again, Bitcoin and the support of the Bitcoin community pays off in being a very positive experience for our community. 
The entire city is jazzed about this event, all the way up to city hall. Even if some of the info is outdated in the movie, it has great outreach potential to those new to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:48:46
Oh man its cold! But, Cleveland is fantastic. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 13:44:59
I would suspect a lot went into this decision. Everything was so tasty. French fries aside, ice cream is surprisingly a very competitive business in Cleveland these days. Many new ice creams shops are opening up all over the place. I can't imagine the cold winter months here are a boon for them either, it has to be a tough business all around. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 15:59:03
Excellent, thank you. I will call ahead and report back. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 17:04:38
That sounds like a great idea! Like, the Bitcoin community in general? 
There are all sorts of ideas the businesses have come up with, barring money as an obstacle. For one, they would all love street signs made indicating Bitcoin Boulevard. This is not something the city would pay for, and we would have to come up with the financing ourselves. Also, stickers, outreach materials, and so forth are all objects which can become quite costly. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 12:48:09
Mike is a member of The Cleveland Bitcoin Meetup, and presented at our Bitcoin Boulevard US launch event about his product on May 1. He is a very talented software developer, a frequent customer to our businesses, and an all around great guy. So happy his hard work is being recognized, so happy he lives in Cleveland!

"Surprised Ohioan here. Well, not surprised really." 
It was intentional.

Thank you for your support! Hope to see you back here some day!
@_date: 2014-10-03 15:27:39
Please! No need to actually use Bitcoin, just let the merchants know Bitcoin sent you. Reach out if you ever want to meet up. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 18:07:25
While it may only last a few seconds, this is a very important step for us. Until now, the city of Cleveland Heights has largely been distant from commenting on our project. Now, they are highlighting us in their promotional materials. 
A big thank you to our home city!
@_date: 2014-05-08 13:32:56
@_date: 2014-05-08 00:07:05
Great developments! Would love to see this concept expand far and wide. 
It really is a community concept, an opportunity to raise awareness. It sounds like you already have a great head start. May want to speak with those 4 merchants, see if there is a merchant's association, and see if a merchant collaboration can be organized. For us, this was largely about small businesses coming together to make a statement about the future of electronic commerce and the cost of doing business. They know they are not in this for a big Bitcoin windfall, but are embracing new ideas which may be quite important to their margins in the years to come. This is a way to provide a voice of competition towards traditional electronic payment systems, which continue to become more expensive and less secure for everyone. It has also been a TON of fun for everyone, and has only been a time investment. 
Also see if there is a local meetup group, and if not start one and host them often sharing time between these restaurants. Invite the general public, make this about awareness for both novices and experts alike. It does not matter if people are spending cash, credit, or bitcoins, the merchants will be happy. So long as the dialog is moving forward, it will be a fun an rewarding experience for everyone. 
If you would like to talk more about logistics, please do not hesitate to reach out. I have spoken with the folks at Bitcoin Boulevard NL, and with other groups in the States. We have discussed the idea of having "bridges" between these types of communities, as a "Bitcoin Boulevard" can happen anywhere. I think these relationships really feed into the global spirit of Bitcoin.
Bitcoiners aside, I think it would be incredible to have a merchant dialogue. Even though they span the globe, I would bet these merchants have so much in common for the reasons they chose Bitcoin. These really are the voices that will help continue to propel adoption. 
Good luck!

Thank you steelerfaninperu. I stand by my actions 100%, it is the right thing to do because it is the  concern of the merchants.
@_date: 2014-04-23 11:17:18
It will be great to see you!
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:13:47
It is basically a poorly thought out decision I think, using existing regulation as cover. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 03:01:30
Thanks, that was a pretty big surprise. 
Cleveland has many innovations going for it right now, this is one of many and our hope is that it helps showcase how far our city has come (even though we still have a lot of work to do). 
Columbus, do it! 
@_date: 2014-09-09 03:54:21
You can buy it off their website using Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 23:09:13
Thanks BitPay! Your software and services are very important elements to this project. So straight forward for the merchants.
@_date: 2014-05-15 21:47:49
Would love to have you! Check out website often, as new places will hopefully begin accepting and it will have updates on the alcohol sitation here in Ohio. 
Also, about the alcohol situation - Katz Club staff know to ring up all food separate from alcohol - great place for a date! Tavern Company will ring only up food if the owner Chris is there (until the alcohol thing is resolved). Bottlehouse is not going to accept Bitcoin for anything until this is resolved. 
SweetieFry not only has Ice Cream, but also fries, burgers, dogs, and all sorts of great stuff. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:22:48
Many do have neon signs for their businesses, but I think I am misunderstanding the question. Donations?

Hello all. I am the organizer of the Bitcoin Boulevard event, and here is my original thread about this matter:
The reddit community had some valuable suggestions. 
The ODPS has to stand by their statements, as this was made in our major newspaper, The Plain Dealer. 
However, this decision was made late Friday and of course no one can be reached on weekends there. I contact the agent in charge yesterday, and they are going to reconsider their position, hopefully in time for our event on Thursday. 
Most of these merchants are using BitPay with 100% USD settlement. So, this is no different than accepting a foreign credit card. The transaction is between BitPay and the merchant, not the customer and the merchant, and this transaction is 100% USD. THIS is not what was passed down to the legal team at the state, even though it was thoroughly discussed. What was passed down was only the information about BTC-BTC direct wallet transactions, which only 1 merchant was hoping to do. 
The agent gave me the opportunity to submit in my own words what needs to be conveyed, and I did this with support from BitPay, including additional information from BitPay themselves. 
What I am hoping for now is a compromise. 1) No for BTC-BTC transactions for alcohol, as this would be barter, and is prohibited by current Ohio liquor law. 2) Yes for BTC-USD using 3rd party payment processor like BitPay, no different than foreign credit card transactions not originating in USD. 
This is a work in progress, as to be expected. 
This is also required part of the Bitcoin adoption process. It would be incredibly irresponsible not to include the regulators in this conversation, as the merchants' entire livelihood is at stake when it comes to liquor control violations. 
Would you rather exclude the entire restaurant and bar business in Ohio from Bitcoin? Not one bar will adopt Bitcoin in Ohio without written approval from these regulatory agencies. 
I will also cross-post this update as an edit to my original thread. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 21:25:17
Thank you, I like to think the majority of the Bitcoin community also has positive reactions to this release. As I see it, this is a great outreach tool for those new to Bitcoin and those who have never heard of it before. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:29:00
I'm sure there are creative ways to get around this, but none of us are interested in a fight that could risk the entire business. Maybe we will have a merchant who would be willing, the boulevard is growing. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 20:26:47
Glad she loved it! Cleveland really is a hidden Gem, but we are trying to showcase many of the great plans we have for our city. I think Cleveland's future is extremely bright. 
Ohio City: Stay Tuned!
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:15:03
In Ohio it does. For instance, you cannot barter for alcohol in Ohio. You can also not give away alcohol for free in Ohio if you have a liquor license. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 03:53:54
More conversation here: 
We are very excited to be launching this film in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, on Bitcoin Boulevard US. This will be a red carpet event, with members of the production team and subjects of this film preset here in Cleveland Heights. Please come by if you are near, all of our Bitcoin Boulevard US merchants will be participating in their own ways. Much more info to follow on this topic as we plan our events. 
The distribution for this movie may have been long awaited, but that does not discredit the value and relevancy of this story, even if some of the content is outdated. It goes to show how fast things are moving in this space. In my opinion, finally having worldwide distribution of this documentary is a big win for Bitcoin.
It's also important to note the contributions Gravitas has made to the bitcoin community: Paying 500 BTC for the rights to this film, offering this film for pre-order via Bitcoin, and offering it via traditional payment methods. Gravitas is an early adopter, a new Bitcoin merchant, and a big investor with this move. I have worked with Michael Murphy these past few weeks, and I have gathered that he is very optimistic about the future of Bitcoin - especially as it relates to the future of his core business of media distribution.
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:19:31
They have concluded that Bitcoin is a commodity, not a currency, in under to fit into this existing law. 
It is a ban, it really does not matter if it is due to an existing rule or not.
@_date: 2014-05-22 13:06:12
It is cool, and exciting, and their community will have a TON of fun with it. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:22:51
Not in Ohio. Barter for alcohol is illegal. As is giving away free alcohol and gift cards under various circumstances. 
Bitcoin is not "illegal" as he says though. 
I am really interests in hearing what our community thinks about this at our event. I
@_date: 2014-05-15 22:27:44
Yes, I will certainly send you an email. I have read about E-Gov and your Bitcoin initiatives. 
While the city has been pretty silent around this so far, I do have some allies on city council who have been big supporters from day one. We have had numerous informal discussion about how this technology could be used to innovate city government payment systems. 
With all this exposure from our grass-roots Bitcoin Boulevard initiate, I am hoping for new opportunities to have new and friendly tech-forward dialogue within our local government.
EDIT: And, thanks!
@_date: 2014-08-14 18:16:01
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:08:25
Precisely a goal of ours. Cleveland is far from a ghost town these days, but there is a lot of works still to be done. We have so much happening, entrepreneurship, innovation, arts, culture, the list goes on. 
Our vision is to help showcase our innovative spirit, that we are thinking about the future and have amenities today that are on par with other world-class cities. We are glad that Bitcoin can help with this initiative, and have been incredible grateful for mass media's response to our project. 
@_date: 2014-10-10 00:59:19
I will be heading there tomorrow!

We want to get actual street signs to hang in the neighborhood. The city will never pay for them, so we may have to raise the funds ourselves. The merchants really like the idea.

Flabbergasted Ohioan here. Well, not surprised really. Ohio must from the ground up, it's been a mess at the top for a very long time. This is part of the Bitcoin Boulevard spirit.  
@_date: 2014-05-30 12:27:41
We won't be. This is far to high a risk for a small business, operaintg under an Ohio liquor license. Their entire livelihood, let alone their business is at stake. 
We are currently working with the regulators to try and resolve this.

Great to see you! So happy this pic has been so popular, I thought it was very special too.
@_date: 2014-04-27 21:28:44
Yes. And just as with the IRS ruling, much of this happens behind closed doors and without participation from people in the community. 
I hope this is not the be-all-end all. I really hope to have many civilized debates about this down the road. I hope we see a growing interest from merchants (or private citizens) to challenge this. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:16:26
The quote is as official as we have for now. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:01:16
Nope. I stand by this 100%. If I convinced a business to accept Bitcoin, then they lost their liquor license, that would be my head on the chopping block and I would not be able to sleep at night. These are my friends, my neighbors, my local small businesses. These are legitimate concerns, and the responsible way to go about addressing them. 
When you ask a bar in Ohio "Would you consider accepting Bitcoin" - the  answer, hands down, is "What does Liquor Control say about it?"
You get nowhere with Bitcoin in Ohio without the answer to this, and is incredible irresponsible to not find one. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:07:17
It is, but I don't think the conversation is over. 
@_date: 2014-10-10 01:00:07
They no longer accept Bitcoin. Called and the guy said they just simply stopped taking it, did not offer a reason. 
@_date: 2014-05-07 19:19:50
Very thankful to Tony Ganzer and the NPR network for featuring our initiative nationwide today on Here &amp; Now. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 18:12:34
Nikhil here, the Irish place called Parnells? They want to take it, but given the situation with alcohol sales they are not currently. They do not serve food, so are suspended for the meantime. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:03:18
Not true, you can get a credit card at 18 or maybe even younger in Ohio. The drinking age is 21. A credit card is not a valid form of identification! 
Some have accused the title as FUD, but I stand by it 100%. It may not be legalese as an explicit ban, but it is effectively banned under current law. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:18:02
Please do!

Most, if not all of our merchants have WiFi. No need for a data plan so long as you connect to the merchant's wifi. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:24:10
Not yet, but they are all watching Bitcoin trends now for sure. One bar was going to keep it all in BTC, but we are still trying to get over this regulatory hurdle. 
It was imperative that this was driven by the merchants. It is for the merchants, in my opinion as much if not more than it is for Bitcoiners. These merchants are not necessarily tech-forward, but they are all looking for news ways to innovate their business models and the tools they employ. Bitcoin sold itself once they had the facts in hand, and they support the ideas it presents for the future of digital commerce and reducing the cost and obstructions often presented by traditional banking.
Plus, it was easy. They could not believe how easy it was to implement. It is still a bit of a challenge not having native integration with POS systems, but it is still far better than they expected. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 21:50:02
Yes. The Ohio Department of Public Safety has declared alcohol cannot be sold for Bitcoin - for now. They are reevaluating their stance though, hope to have an answer soon-ish. All other regulators have given us a go, but these are the folks which enforce the laws and can cause a TON of grief to liquor license holders. 
If we still get a "No", we have plans in place for next steps. It will not stop there. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:19:40
I think this is indeed due to misunderstanding of the technology. 
I think you are right that some of the verbiage used by the merchants could be said differently, but the real issue is the unwillingness to understand the payment processing system. They had the information. We had several discussion. They decided against it anyway. 
This event is largely about Bitcoin awareness, so I think this actually energizes a very important debate that is required for many businesses to be comfortable accepting Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:35:20
Please visit our official website,  for info. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:14:45
Right, and under that ruling it's banned.

This is an emerging technology, and the negativity mostly comes from hidden, misinformed commentators on websites such as this Yahoo article. In person, our entire community has been supportive and excited about this. Animosity has been pretty much nil. 
Politics aside, this is a business experiment, and that is our motive. Competition to big banks? Yes please. These small businesses experience bank obstructionism from day 1. Even if Bitcoin is new, and not widely used, we want to explore it. The future looks very bright with Blockhain technologies such as Bitcoin. The merchants love the global nature of it, respect the inherent identity protection and fraud prevention, no charge-backs, and of course the publicity. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 04:13:28
Indeed. This is great news for Bitcoin. Outdated or not, it tells a compelling story. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:15:55
Come on by! Let the merchants know Bitcoin sent you!
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:15:23
This initiative continues to highlight our merchants, our city, and our citizens in the world press. This is brand awareness we simply could never have afforded otherwise. 
Today, Korean Broadcasting System is visiting our street to film us as part of a 60 minute Bitcoin documentary. This is Korea's largest TV and Radio system. Next week we will be in Newsweek. 
We have had visitors from hundreds of miles visit our street to buy goods. All of our merchants have nearly daily discussions with the general public, and our entire community is behind us.  The stigma around Bitcoin has been GREATLY reduced in our community due to this, and we have had incredible support all around.  
@_date: 2014-10-03 15:25:48
Thanks so much, was a ton of fun. Look forward to seeing you!
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:25:42
It's a discussion that needs to happen. It was bound to happen as awareness increased, I just hope for better results down the road. It's all still so new.

The Feds said "we consider this a private business arrangement. We don't care what they take as payment as long as we get our tax money".

A Bitcoin Boulevard can happen anywhere!
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:14:52
That's too bad. The whole reason the IRS ruling was a disaster was because they did not consider the bitcoin community in the discussion. There needs to be a relationship this this mayhem does not continue. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:12:35
Same with Bitcoin, they are using BitPay to settle 100% USD. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:57:25
There are a lot of creative workarounds I have been collecting, this is a new one. Still, the merchants are not trying to work the system. Too much in it for them to risk their liquor license just for Bitcoin. 
Another thing to remember is that Bitcoin is expected to make up very little in sales. This is about a statement to the banking industries, embracing the future, brand awareness, and all sorts of other areas. It's not worth it to risk the liquor license by trying to thwart the system, they really have to work within it no matter how much it works against them. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:32:04
We tried, but yes this is very expensive. We never expected huge Bitcoin revenues, as this was more about education and awareness. We would have LOVED to have an ATM from day 1, but it was simply too far out of reach. 
This is an ongoing project though, so we hope to expand our merchant offerings and services! 
@_date: 2014-04-14 20:32:04
Shop local whenever possible, encourage local merchants to learn about and consider Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 16:00:36
Thanks, don't think I'll have time to get to Fort Collins though. 
I do not seem to be able to add restaurants to this site, I wonder if that feature is not available right now?
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:52:32
We are not, we are asking how not to lose our businesses. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 12:45:15
This is the scenario I was referring to - specifically asking to pay more when using a CC payment than other forms of payment. I was under the impression this was prohibited under CC contracts, but perhaps that is no longer the case. 
 
@_date: 2014-05-08 00:10:27
How about Bitcoin Boulevard: MIT? 
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:21:12
Not sure. The license may actually cover the entire business, I will call for clarification Monday.
But, this will be a logistical problem anyway, and I am not sure if merchants will want to separate their products checkout process. So far the logistics have been mostly transparent to them and their employees.
@_date: 2014-08-14 18:24:47
Thanks again for visiting Keonne!
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:20:57
This would be a great idea. Bitcoin is many things at once, depending on its use at a given time. It does not fit into existing laws. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 12:41:14
Good idea, I was planning on approaching him first on how he would like to receive this money. Does not look like it will be much anyhow, but he will appreciate it. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 23:40:39
 
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:39:48
That sounds like a great idea
@_date: 2014-06-06 20:15:43
Good luck, hope to visit one day!
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:24:38
I am in Colorado Springs as we speak! I was looking for places that accept Bitcoin while here, sadly there really is nothing.
@_date: 2014-04-10 13:17:11
Look forward to seeing you! Just a reminder, except for The Wine Spot who currently accepts Bitcoin, all the other businesses do not start accepting Bitcoin until May 1. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 20:17:06
I think 2014 will be a big year for adoption, which will also provide new tests of Bitcoin's ability to scale. The press has really brought awareness towards Bitcoin, and its a pretty simple thing for many businesses to integrate. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:34:22
Yup - we started small, 1 business in a tight-knit business community. Once others saw success, they invested their very valuable time to learn more about Bitcoin. Once they did, Bitcoin sold itself in no time. It was a merchant collaborative that made this happen, we all worked together, even those who are local competitors. This was as much about community awareness as it was about brand awareness for each merchant. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 13:14:25
Because very few people use cash anymore, and even fewer use Bitcoin. Pretty much impossible to sustain a business without offering credit card processing as a service to customers. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 20:05:23
Yeah, I hope he comes to the event, as a professor for a quite prestigious business school I was disheartened to read his under researched conclusions. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 13:45:01
Ha, yup, some may be a bit outdated but I'm sure it will be a compelling film nonetheless. Hope it makes the likes of Netflix streaming in due time as well. Wish you could join us in Cleveland! 
@_date: 2014-10-14 13:27:31
The credit card fees are not what made them go out of business, I assume. Its a tough business, and as they say it may have been too niche to sustain in that location at this time. 
All businesses have to increase their prices to cover the costs of credit card fees. We as consumers pay more for products because of these fees. 
Also, it is against credit card processor policy to state that you are charging those fees to customers. For instance, when you see a sign at a business saying things like "we charge 50 cents extra for transactions under $10" - totally not allowed. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 17:38:18
Precisely! Quinn's and Chucks are no longer in business. The Pub has changed owners several times. Theatre is still awesome (and will have some interesting BTC news coming from them soon, too...). The neighborhood has changed much for the better since you were there. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 12:48:10
Here is exactly why we reached our proactively to resolve this issue, to try and avoid mayhem like this which just happened to an artist here in Cleveland this past weekend. This is the same agency which has said "NO" to our efforts, and the same agency that would enforce violations with our alcohol-serving Bitcoin Boulevard merchants. 
Terrible. 
So, no, no one here will risk their business with things like this happening. Plus, I will be at work while the dinner is happening - so no booze for me at that time!
Maybe if we get this resolved by the State it would be a fun gesture to stage a transaction between you and one of our bar merchants to celebrate. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 23:06:38
Well, we now have many new places to hold our Cleveland Bitcoin Meetup Group, and you are always welcome to attend those no matter where you are from! 
A conference would be a fun idea too, would love to attract something like that to Cleveland. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:07:05
You said it mon! It is insane, and the worst is when anonymous callers report a violation.
Gift cards are also very restricted in Oho liquor law. You cannot use them for on premise drinks, unless a certain percentage is food. Its all crazy stuff.
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:09:55
Yes, as we have a relationship with the folks in The Netherlands, I wanted to start with these two groups and formulate some sort of entity for the merchants to share experiences. 
Great idea to reach out to Patrick Byrne though, thank you. And it will be important that this is inclusive for any small business who wants to be involved. I have also tossed around the idea that membership would be open only to community merchant associations - this would encourage community involvement. I dunno, all very early yet. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 23:19:13
Aww gee thanks! I truly enjoy being involved with this technology. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:16:55
I will be making a lot of phone calls this week, this is not the end of the story, but for now my alcohol selling merchants have disabled Bitcoin processing. 
If you ask me, settling for 100% USD with the payment processor should be enough argument. So far, it isn't though. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:10:32
Glad to hear!
@_date: 2014-10-03 15:26:41
Thank you, I thought the news station and Jim Donovan himself really prepared well too. Great questions, very relevant and informed. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 21:52:54
It still has a very long way to go. This, we hope, offers a case study and some real-world experiences which will be valuable to the development of this technology. The future has yet to be written, and there is so much ahead. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 18:15:33
Precisely. It was never 100% about sales in the first place. Even one sale is seen as a success, and they have seen far more than expected. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:18:35
Thank you. This is precisely how I see this ruling. Accepting Bitcoin, for some merchants, is also a statement against senseless government rules and bank manipulation. 
I am not surprised, and I think this will actually energize a whole new debate for our launch on Thursday.
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:25:55
Thanks! That would be fantastic, and please let the merchants know you traveled. Knowing we have what seems to be pretty small base of bitcoin consumers in Cleveland, one of our goals is to draw visitors who are passing though.
@_date: 2014-09-09 03:57:29
I disagree. Do companies such as Coinbase, Bitpay, Blockchian, Cryptsy, etc profit from innovating around this same open source technology? Yes, and they deserve to do so. Intellectual property created by creative arts and mass media is just as relevant as the intellectual property created by software companies. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 22:29:51
Indeed! The Bitcoin Boulevard US project really is a statement about the future, and that we are not afraid to explore new ways compete and promote our city. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:18:36
Thx! We think so too and are grateful for all the positivity in response to this project. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:51:01
Thank you so much for your kind words. It has been an uplifting and rewarding experience in ways we never imagined. We expected adversity, and so far this is the only we have had. Otherwise everyone has been incredibly supportive - from the community, journalists, customers, everyone. 
A huge success already and we have not even launched yet.

So glad you came by and had a great experience. It's hard to visit these shops nowadays without hearing chatter about Bitcoin from the customers. This is exactly what we hoped for! And, it's all been greeted with intrigue and positivity ( for the most part ). The community has really embraced this initiative. 
That is so cool you were there to be a resource for her questions. 
SweetyFry certainly is delicious!

October 3 in theaters, NY/LA/Cleveland. Official press release here: 
Press release already submitted here: 
We are very excited to be launching this film in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, on Bitcoin Boulevard US. This will be a red carpet event, with members of the production team and subjects of this film preset here in Cleveland Heights. Please come by if you are near, all of our Bitcoin Boulevard US merchants will be participating in their own ways. Much more info to follow on this topic as we plan our events. 
The distribution for this movie may have been long awaited, but that does not discredit the value and relevancy of this story, even if some of the content is outdated. It goes to show how fast things are moving in this space. In my opinion, finally having worldwide distribution of this documentary is a big win for Bitcoin.
It's also important to note the contributions Gravitas has made to the bitcoin community: Paying 500 BTC for the rights to this film, offering this film for pre-order via Bitcoin, and offering it via traditional payment methods. Gravitas is an early adopter, a new Bitcoin merchant, and a big investor with this move. I have worked with Michael Murphy these past few weeks, and I have gathered that he is very optimistic about the future of Bitcoin - especially as it relates to the future of his core business of media distribution.
@_date: 2014-08-15 13:40:12
Ha that's pretty great! Katz is excellent, he has several top notch restaurants in the area (but only 1 that accepts Bitcoin, for now).
@_date: 2014-05-22 12:58:25
Congrats! Great to see adoption momentum moving forward! 
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:44:12
That would be great! Yes, May 1 6pm at The Wine Spot. I will be speaking, as will the merchants and a few people from our Cleveland Bitcoin Meetup who are building mining hardware and HTML5 wallet software. 
Of course, anytime after that is fine. We look forward to Bitcojn tourism :) 
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:04:58
Good idea actually. These laws differ state to state, country to county. I will reach out. 
@_date: 2014-05-07 19:30:17
Please! Make sure to tell the merchants that Bitcoin sent you, even if you plan on spending cash/credit. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:49:21
Yes, and this will be highlighted once again when I call them. There is one bar owner who wanted to keep BTC, but I am sure he would be OK switching to USD if we have to. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 19:06:45
All the merchants are very aware of the risks of 0 conf transactions. So far no issues at all, and the risk of a race attack is incredibly low. 
Customers do not have to wait at all.
We see these risks as far lower than counterfeit cash, credit card chargebacks, and identity theft. With that being said, this is all proof of concept and we are watching the transactions closely. 
@_date: 2014-05-07 20:08:35
No problem! 
@_date: 2014-05-15 19:07:46
Thx for the support! Bitcoiners aside, these small business owners are totally energized by this project. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:15:47
I am not surprised either, and I think this actually energizes a debate that will need to happen in many locales for various business types to accept Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:16:47
Not until the State changes its current stance, which it is reevaluating now. More info on our site, 
@_date: 2014-05-16 23:40:51
Thanks for the support!
@_date: 2014-05-08 13:32:42
Just offering it out there as a suggestion. The "Bitcoin Boulevard" concept already has a pretty well known brand in itself (it was even used in the title of this post). I think it would be a fun way to showcase relationships between distant communities. 
Either way, I think it would be great for MIT to organize something of this nature (no matter what its called). 
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:54:22
It was targeted, as we asked specifically about Bitcoin, and they made an opinion strictly on Bitcoin. No, in legalese it may not an explicit ban. But, call it what you will, Bitcoin is not allowed for alcohol sales in Ohio.
@_date: 2014-10-14 13:48:28
Looking into options, I really don't want to bother them too much right now as I am sure they have a lot on their plate. I may add something to the Bitcoin Boulevard US Facebook page though and tag them, maybe they will volunteer participation that way. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 02:59:59
Yeah, we thought that was pretty funny. Thanks for the support!
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:29:35
Yes, I think having a noontime slot on national NPR is a pretty good opportunity for increased sales. Especially in a community which is very, very pro NPR. 
That is one metric that is very difficult to measure (the non-BTC sales directly resulting from this initiative). But, most have had customers walk in and buy product with cash/credit who have specifically said it was because of the bitcoin project. Many others comment that they have seen/heard all this news and are excited about it. 
The merchants all are experiencing a lot of dialogue in their stores around Bitcoin. Customers mention it all the time when they visit, so the word is out there and it is helping people keep these businesses in their mind. 
From day 1, these merchants knew they would not be in for any type of windfall. Revive, for instance, is a fair trade retailer. For them, Bitcoin is a symbol of a future where the owner no longer has to deal with banks, wire transfers, paper money, travelers checks, and credit cards when she is trying to pay her artisans worldwide. With Bitcoin, this theoretically could enable her to pay her artisans directly, and nearly immediately. While the technology is not there yet, the promise is exciting to think about and the technology is available for them to explore right now. 
So, the motivation for accepting Bitcoin was far more than just increased revenues. It is a statement about how small business is thinking towards the future, embracing non-traditional ways to conduct business and avoid obstructionism by traditional systems. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 21:51:44

Mobile site: 
@_date: 2014-05-16 23:43:57
Yeah, the site is basically a version 0.1!  And yes, 0 budget so just a quick wordpress jobby. I would never consider myself a web developer, just wanted to have something up in time for the launch. 
Thanks for the critique, all is noted and very much appreciated. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 16:38:58
I'd love to join via Skype! And, just because I can't buy beer *in* Ohio with Bitcoin (yet), does not mean I cannot treat my overseas friends to a pitcher of beer *from* Ohio. 
Let's see if skype has good enough resolution to scan a QR code bar tab! 
@_date: 2014-09-16 13:28:51
It will be available worldwide on demand through iTunes and on their website via bitcoin October 10th. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 17:35:02
Thanks! It's a family friendly street, as are the bars, with lots of N/A option. Make sure to tell them Bitcoin sent you!
@_date: 2014-05-30 13:34:08
Precisely, thanks so much!
@_date: 2014-07-21 20:11:05
Nice! Happy they included us in their final edits. We hosted KBS for a day in Cleveland, Ohio on our Bitcoin Boulevard. 
Thank you for posting this, I was curious when it would be aired. Great to see they featured Lisa from Revive and Bill from Mitchell's Chocolates. Would love to obtain a translation at some point, it looks like a very well organized documentary. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 20:16:21
This is what frustrates us the most.
@_date: 2014-08-14 18:17:16
Just 2 have suspended, BottleHouse and Parnells. Katz Club, Tavern Company, and The Wine Spot all accept Bitcoin for non-alcohol items, as do the rest of the retail stores.
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:34:58
Yup, look up the Gift Card area of the law. Bizarro world stuff here:
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:20:44
Well, it's front page news of the Sunday business section today.
I think this story is far from over. I want the discussion to remain civil, but I think this needs to be challenged. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 21:51:25
It would be, and it still can be!
@_date: 2014-04-27 21:32:56
If you are visiting from Europe and use your credit card here, you are not using the dollar. The bank is first converting it, yet this is allowed. 
They targeted Bitcoin by claiming it was a commodity instead of a currency, and I think this was deliberate as an "easy" way out of this discussion.

Sure, if you are willing to risk losing your liquor license, and thus your family business. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 12:43:27
Interesting, thanks for the context. I will have to share this with the merchants, many have expressed the inability in their contracts to charge extra for their processing fees. At any rate, these are all hidden in the retail price of items we buy everywhere anyway. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 15:27:00
Just want to congratulate Mike for his app being accepted in the App Store! He is a member of the Cleveland Bitcoin Meetup, a talented software developer, and spoke about his HTML 5 version of Coin Pocket at our Bitcoin Boulevard US launch event on May 1:
 
@_date: 2014-04-29 18:30:05
Exactly. This is a learning process for regulators just as it is for the general public.
As of yesterday they have already agreed to revisit this ruling, with exhaustive information about the Bitpay process, 100% USD settlement. Bitpay was included in the message and included additional information of their own.
Please see the edit to my original post for updates info. Let's hope for a reasonable compromise.
