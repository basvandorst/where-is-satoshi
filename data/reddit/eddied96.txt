Im not sure what you're aim was with the post but most of us understand the point of hodling, you've added nothing but spam to the sub and ruining the chances of quality posts from reaching the top.


Sorry you get so excited by prices drops your feel the need to post like a noob and assume the users that don't want your spam havnt been in early enough, quiet the opposite usually, theyre just sick of shitpost spam

You don't use playstore? Im genuinely curious why
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:03:53
Fair enough, does lineage cover all your needs? Hows it's as a daily driver? il take convenience over a little performance though..  Invasive pop ups? Not sure whiche youre referring to tbh

Your sister needs a new job..

Look at his post history, hes an angry human that feels the need to continuously shitpost to garner attention. Also "redditor of 6 weeks"
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:17:09
And your solution was to point this out like a big fucking baby? If you don't care about them, pretend they don't exist. If they get downvoted, pick a better title, post at another time. The world isint easy, it sure as hell doesn't owe you views on your thread.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:06:30
And you couldn't look past the instant downvotes? (from people you're not trying to get attention from anyway) and wait for a genuine response? If i see downvotes even mentioned in the title, il probably downvote. tell me what i amalready gauranteed to know,  or being salty instantly makes me discard posts as rubbish or immature. 
The real talk occurs in threads with a good title /subject, a quick summary or explanation and or an opinion/response. When OP is interested in how people respond rather than the content they respond with, then OP likely has nothing much to offer either.

What is thread? 
Do you even read this subreddit?
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:30:04
Neither because nobody fucking knows so stop trying to predict it and spreading your opinion like its fact. 50% drop gets a lot of longterm people to buy, 50% increase gets normies heads turning. So..? You don't know how many of either bought or buying
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:04:12
Mind me asking what you did? Manually deciding what block to mine? Or is that possible? Ive no idea
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:09:14
You assumed that from a comment? Wheres the destroyed cryptos you're talking out of your ass about?
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:35:54
Why not just say that? It has nothing to do with the comment i posted to, your point in that comment was one would encourage people to buy more than the other which is false, you don't know the answer.

Sorry but thats terrible advice, find a balance between information density and clean simple interface based on the requirements of the project. 
Analyse the requirements before "simplifying or cleaning" anything. 
Also don't take advice from people that have no idea what they're talking about

I had the problem with it disappearing and coming back, the exchange i bought from uses low fees to send bought btc and he assured me it was the rise in btc and sure enough when it dropped my orders was processed and the coins arrived.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:37:53
You keep saying that but youre not proving that
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:54:59
Nobody but you guys got salty..? The guy pointed Hodl is not a gauranteed method, it had been in the past but that obviously cannot predict the future . Whats wrong with that?
You a little insecure about your investment?
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:33:20
There were many light heated hodl posts, or reminders for people to not sell. But all the dicks with the posts this morning were very quiet over the last few days. Experience gets you nowhere when no pattern is being followed. A belief in bitcoin is what's bringing it forward and all it takes is a massive scandal or law to fuck it if it hasn't garnered the strength to power on. In saying that, all publicity is good publicity has proved an ally to many concepts and hopefully bitcoin is similar.
I havnt a sold, i recommended to a few not to but i certainly don't tell people what to do with their money and investments especially "i told you so" after they lose it
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:03:59
Whys that? They're world leaders not hobby bitcoin hodlers or dickheads with too much bitcoin that come here to boast like yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:26:10
If you're here to shit on Roger V you need to grow up, we have a possibility to make an alternative to the rediculous system of corruption the world runs on and youre busy thinking of how youl essentially advertise bitcoin cash here by continually mentioning it like a fucking parrot.

Why you so mad?

Thats not why it was said, meat eaters on reddit that feel the need to challenge vegetarians seem to have to confirm how tasty meat is as a valid reason to eat it , ignoring the fact the meat industry is harming our planet to a rediculous level and lowering the nutritional intake of humans in general from lack of plants, nuts, etc
I eat meat but I know in the long run I need to switch if im to do the right thing and stick to my principles.
I have no beef (pun intended) with anybody vegetarian or not but atleast both sides should understand each other. Meat is my main part of meals because its convenient and i prefer it to vegetable texture but i dont go around saying how tasty it is because I know im in the wrong just as i dont go around trying to get people to stop eating meat because there are plenty reasons to not switch cold turkey (pun intended)

Because my local bitcoin seller is 40 minutes away.  Aprox 15 euro worth petrol

Minimum 50 euro to send bank transfer :/

Becuase debit cards are rarely accepted, or paypal or becuase im from Europe

Can you use bank transfers with kraken? I thought it was just cryptocurrencies

My apologies wont happen again. REGRETFUL

Your point is moot, investing in bitcoin is for the future. I belive it will play a large part in how thing's operate. And if it doesn't, well i lost some paychecks i cant get back. Its an interest, a hobby and something to look forward to.
Hit tough times, get attacked and still keep moving its pretty reseliant so far. If you don't want to invest in bitcoin, why are you here. The fact youre here to making passive snide comments is so predictable
@_date: 2015-04-11 10:54:31
I don't see why it should,  they accept it,  isn't that enough? 
@_date: 2015-04-26 09:34:01
no seriously though,  start your own bar
@_date: 2015-03-20 11:57:37
your point is..?
