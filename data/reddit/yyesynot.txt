I have a general knowledge of bitcoin, and an advanced knowledge in banking.  I will tell you that I have discussed bitcoin with bankers in multiple states (as in CFOs/CEOs).  They aren't touching it due to its reputation.  Bank Secrecy Act (anti-money laundering) compliance costs would go through the roof.  Not to mention, credit monitoring would be non-sensical.  Most bank's do annual collateral reviews, if required by policy.  If the bank made a loan with bitcoin collateral and a loan-to-value (LTV) of 50% today, which is very low (more collateral protection than a slow-moving asset like raw land), but then came back to find that bitcoin price had plummeted back down to March levels, they might be at 100%+ LTV, which means loss exposure.  Also, Bitcoin won't push fiat money out of the banks because bank's use core processing that is not and will not be integrated with bitcoin anytime soon.  Speaking of transactions, I read something about a fork due to small block sizes, can you or someone else here confirm for me if that means Bitcoin will be less efficient as time goes on and transaction volume continues to rise?  Lastly, I'm not hating on Bitcoin at all.  In my view, bitcoins are like baseball cards, stamps, and gold coins, except superior in the features of trading (arguably more liquid than electronic fiat as trading markets expand).  Bitcoins followers are quite religious about it, and well, no one is really manufacturing them, they are here to stay (from what I can see).  My goal is to own one by the end of the year and retire on it in 30 years.  Come on coiners, keep on believing.

If they are taking them as deposits and paying 5% (bitcoin) and lending them out at 30% (high risk pricing = credit card rates), then they have a spread of 25% bitcoin.  As long as they are effective in lending bitcoin to match deposits, they would earn 1 btc from a 1 btc deposit every four years.  This is how banks make money.  
  
  The foreign exchange risk does not exist in this transaction since the loans are in bitcoin and the deposits are in bitcoin.  However, this "bank" would be taking on incredible amounts of credit risk, due to how volatile the value of 1 btc can be.  The bank would likely need to deploy a hedging strategy to mitigate this risk.  Depositors would be at risk of losing their deposits if all this financial innovation leads to failure.  This is because a bank does not work like an exchange.  A bank literally takes the currency you give them and lends it out, as in, you would be transferring your bitcoin to the bank and they would be giving you a statement of how much they owe you (your deposit balance).

Too bad there isn't a rule for it!  Thanks for your opinion.

Eustan is from the second wave of users, i.e. Silk Road.  He does not value compliance.  Meanwhile, anyone who is anyone is trying to get Bitcoin regulated, which will force money launderers out, or put them on government lists thru the exchange reporting.

That is awesome.

Who cares if people think it's currency, commodity, or both?

Agreed, and they need to stop buying CP with Bitcoin.

Is there an economic or finance rule that volatility should decline as a currency gains wider use?  It's not intuitive to me at all.  From my observations of Bitcoin prices and the community pumping it up, people buy it up during times of potential turmoil, and then the strong returns lure new investors.  It's hard to tell the intent of the buyers however.  Maybe the current run is ETF or another driving factor, as opposed to North Korea and a saber-rattling President (which would be my guess).

Haven't lurked here in a while.. what is HODL?  I know it means to hold long term, but is there an inside joke with it?

I don't support criminal activity, but I do think that the privacy at all costs model is a good one.  It mirrors the privacy requirements of banks that are set out in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.  For example, the bank can't tell anyone I have an account, my account number, my contact information, my SSN, my transaction history, or any other personally identifiable information (PII).  If the cops have a warrant, they can get that info, which is a key difference; that being said, I don't want anyone to be handling my PII unless it's needed to provide me with banking services.  GLBA compliance is built into Bitcoin.
