Please note that it's just one opinion of one guy and not of Dogecoin community in general.

Such sad. My heart is with you, Bitcoin friends.
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:47:34
Quite frankly, I wouldn't trust U.S. justice system either. As much as I think Karpeles is a bad guy, I can't really blame him for being afraid to come there.

IMO miners aren't really currency emitters, because they can't emit Bitcoin at their will. They win those Bitcoins in a sort of hash computation contest. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:54:28
Because merchants typically have more incentives to keep good reputation than consumers, beside as you said yourself you can use escrow if you really need it. There is no reason to shove it down everyones throat.
@_date: 2014-03-01 12:49:18
Maybe they had coins in MtGox.

"If only they reopen and give my coins back, I will stay with them." - this sounds like you are at bargaining stage of grief: 
I'm sorry about your loss.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:14:16
Yea, especially with his PHP skills...
@_date: 2014-05-11 10:43:51
Actually there is no record of Ghandi every saying that, but it's a cool saying nonetheless. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:51:09
Don't worry shibes, Bitcoin will recover. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 04:28:03
Except the hackers already knew about the vulnerability
@_date: 2014-03-03 09:01:44
So it's perfectly adequate for most of the Web.
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:01:12
WTF, Santa doesn't exist??
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:37:01
Or someone who wants others to believe that the coins were really stolen.
@_date: 2014-03-28 07:09:02
Chargebacks have hidden costs, because sometimes customers cheat. They are not good for consumers buying from reputable merchants, because additional risk of losing money has to be included in the price of products. Basically every consumer that is buying from a reputable merchant is paying for the stupid and thieves.

They don't, and there is nothing greatly ironic in using "services" of someone who aims a gun at your head.
Government created the thing called limited liability and it doesn't allow competition in the justice system.

So there is still a hope that Satoshi is a cute asian girl, like I always imagined?
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:04:15
It's true that his fees were high, but at least initially it gave the chance other exchanges to compete by offering lower fees. Also he bought the Polish exchange which lost all bitcoins (I don't remember name) and covered ALL loses of the customers of this exchange (it was a lot of money). He really didn't have to do any of these.

I don't know where your impression comes from, but there is no cult of him.
@_date: 2013-11-13 11:00:40
Because buying Bitcoin is extremely risky speculation and he doesn't think gambling with the money of his clients is a good idea? 
@_date: 2013-11-14 11:11:04
Will they blacklist Bitcoins stolen from Silk Road accounts by feds?
If not, then it's clear the initiative isn't about stopping criminals but aiding them.
@_date: 2013-07-23 04:19:27
Average, somewhat tech savvy person can still earn coins, just not by mining.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:47:37
It's the first time I read that not taxed = not real... &gt;_&gt;
@_date: 2013-11-04 12:43:56
Thing is, I never agreed to pay any money for the "services". I never signed any contract that says that I buy the services and for how much. I just happened to be born into the existing system, just like slaves used to be born into slavery and serfs into serfdom. Moreover, even if I simply refuse any of the services, it wouldn't change my situation at all. I will still have to pay taxes under the threat of imprisonment, to whichever gang claims the country I live in its turf. And yes, it is immoral.
@_date: 2013-12-07 13:03:01
dude Bitcoin isn't falling, it's just that everything else in the world is in bubble. /s
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:16:45
They can't control Bitcoin but they can control every legal business. Bitcoin can be reduced to black/gray market transactions.

In many democracies it's a crime to disrespect the head of state or national symbols. Somehow they get away with it while monarchies are criticized for equivalent laws.

There is $80000+ bounty on his head in Bitcoins. Dude fights for his life.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:10:34
I believe it's a test. Satoshi is testing our faith.
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:19:55
I think he simply didn't know what to ask on the hearing and he was hoping we give him some directions. It doesn't necessarily make him a good guy.
@_date: 2013-11-04 12:37:16
Vital services is at most 1% of what government does and Bitcoin taxation is not a fair way to pay for them.
@_date: 2013-11-15 10:36:16
Proposing discussion IS pushing it. It always starts with innocent "hypothetical" discussions. The whole purpose of blacklisting is an attempt to control currency system which was designed as P2P, exactly to prevent such control.
Mike Hearn is free not to use Bitcoins, if he doesn't like that some are "dirty".
@_date: 2013-07-30 05:18:36
Except it doesn't matter if you participate. The people elected by "majority" (usually it's not really a majority, but it doesn't matter) will impose any rules they make on you by force, whether you participate in their system or not. They will do it even if you explicitly and clearly say "no thanks I'm not part of your democracy". You can't opt out from the tyranny of the masses, so don't pretend like there is some choice (other than the same choice the slaves or serfs had). The voting is not a fair contract between equal people, it's a scam.
@_date: 2013-11-13 10:55:58
To his defense, the way Bitcoin works isn't exactly a simple concept and there was plenty of bubbles in the history when people invested in them responded to critics with something like "you don't understand" and that the price will always go up.
@_date: 2013-11-04 12:26:19
If it's so great, then why it's compulsory?
@_date: 2013-11-04 13:44:24
Very good point.
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:49:59
Sorry, which one of these three was ideological bitcoiner?
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:15:59
There is no reason to do so, BTC is far more recognizable.
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:17:04
Even for pure Bitcoin transactions, your picture is a bit wrong, there should be a third person mining the transaction block in the middle.
@_date: 2013-11-04 13:17:32
Avoiding taxes is risky, but there is a risk to anything in life. It's unfortunate that a gang of criminals so powerful, the state itself, wants to steal your money, but if you can't fight them, the second best thing is hiding your income and your wealth.
If three robbers come at night to your house, there is really nothing wrong with not telling them that your life savings are hidden in a safe behind the painting on the wall - especially if they don't know about the money in the first place. And this is not fantasy land, people do this every day.
