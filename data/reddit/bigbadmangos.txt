Nah, I usually just read articles of BTC on my own. Most bitcoin communities are absolutely wack and push their agenda down your throat, even if their argument is completely illogical. This sub seems to be more childish than illogical.

Ah you must be a very important person... how old are you anyway? JC

Literal 12 year olds if I had to guess. I view this sub as a meme sub for my amusement. The arguments made here make me cringe, but this one takes the cake.
Disclaimer: I have BTC. I also work at a big 4 bank, so I guess that makes me the enemy? Lol

Then just turn off notifications. You obviously knew your post was shit. Otherwise you wouldn't have deleted it. Take the L bro.

90% of this sub is 12 year olds not understanding how economics work saying the same shit over and over again. Bank bad. Cash bad. Boomer gen bad.
Good job OP

No youre in their country. They want their currency. How hard is that to understand.
@_date: 2019-09-22 17:18:43
Just because you're in another country where their currency is less valuable than yours doesnt automatically mean they will just take your currency. Youre in another country for fuck sake. Also its 23k dong to 1 dollar. No idea why youd convert from 1 dong to usd. Its always 1usd to X.

Nope. I was just there a month ago. I was in almost every major city and prices are almost always in VND. Its rare to see USD.
