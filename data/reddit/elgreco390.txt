Run with it. If your like most folks you just have a PC running anyways, and thats what I have. Just a simple running system that is always on.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:34:34
Good think it wont be implemented! LoL - like my asian ass says "No money , No honey!"
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:01:59
I mined coins in 2009, so no one is worrying. Just want to keep the conversation going. Not everything has to be taken personal, ya cretin
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:12:23
by the way setup an ad like [this one](  and sell a few here and there , its easy. Sell a few thousand here and there and drop a new car for your wife , or send your kid to private school. Get some new shoes, yours are looking shabby!

What miner do you use on Windows 10 for a 6 x 8 Gb NVIDEA cards 1070's . I can test it out and see if it makes less or more than nicehash. I can also test it out on linux. Looking for the fastest I can push for experimentation. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:12:39
ok, if you are buying and selling at McDonalds its anonymous , there are so many ads in the US under craigslist to meet and exchange that you would never know who did what

Too bad you don't know how Futures works , but [this link]( does!
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:16:54
how about $10,000
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:17:13
Bought all kinds of stuff at $7200/btc , like PC's , motherboards and high end graphic cards since I was in the green.When its high you spend ! When its down you keep
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:16:55
how do you transfer without copy and paste? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:35:15
nope, its BLOOMBERG News, lots of folks read that. They have quite a following. This keeps many folks from jumping in. Influence is not just a shit article, its the number readers you "own"
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:06:38
Anonymous as in you can pay who you want to whomever you want without a trace . If you buy it , it only shows your transaction that you bought bitcoin, but when you sell or buy stuff, it's a wallet to wallet transaction. No banks, No regulators , No Nada Mister!
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:29:16
Where's the proof? Why don't you post a link. a blog post , a news site , anything. Think your making shit up
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:30:56
It's dead before it hit the water! LoL
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:37:08
aaaaaaaah, your right. Just xfered to a new wallet and checked. Folks also have been saying that you check first and last digits. It only captures copies and checks to see if its a possible wallet, then converts it on paste. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:30:01
Don't know but wish I could sell there
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:04:51
EAT THE RICH! Fuck the banks, the want to muscle in on a game they started and now its up to the people
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:15:20
Keep them bitcoins , boys &amp; girls!
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:01:36
good idea. What software do you use? Also, how do you convert them to BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:56:27
Folks like you should NOT buy, this is about enthusiasm and fun. 
I already am in the green. I bought one at $4000 when it went down to $3700 and I panicked but held on. Now I'm in the GREEN! check out  !
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:24:42
Checking with your eyes is no good, due to the fact that the macro captures it after you paste it and send it. So it would have to fit after you send it, the trojan see's that its an address then redirects. I do like the idea of an opensource copy paste, only problem is that its javascript, you need a pipeline after that to make sure it goes thru the stack to the real blockchain address or a trojan detector !   Shit! Thats it, a virus detector! Gee, I'm smarter than I thought I was - ugh
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:25:34
damn cool. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:13:40
The real bitcoin, not the segwit2x - hahahhaha
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:15:36
Time to stick to the old default wallets , tried and tested wallets
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:09:51
I mine using old Butterfly Asic miners. They are now worth keeping running all the time now that its above $6k/btc  .   A trickle of mula is a trickle of $$
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:40:30
sorry, had to borrow your pic for our corporate overlords
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:45:14
Not to be an ass or anything, but why let ANYONE know, just occasionally pull some out , I hope you don't have it all in one wallet, spread it out into randome 10-15  btc coins each, sounds like a lot of work but you have to do it. Also get yourself a god damn TREZOR wallet, you can afford it. 
You can help  your family when and how you want to when you control the $$$. I was stupid enough to inherit some money from my uncle who passed away 4 years ago. A cool million and a half. Within 2 months , ex wife was asking to not work and why should we work, and fights over money. I don't know what kind of relationship you have but , remember , money changes everything. 
I was given a divorce 2 years after, we owned a home and believe me, she got it. She also asked for child support and I HAVE to work to pay for my townhome AND for 20% child support , I also had to pay for her attorney fees.  I love my kid and all, and I want him to have everything I can afford, but I could have used the money to good use.  One last thing, men rarely get custody , they are looked at like a paycheck from the courts. 
Grow some balls and think of how lucky you are to help your family , a little bit at a time and as slow as you want, because you are in charge.

Everyone has a reason, I say its anonymity 
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:34:06
why. Why don't you give them your hash?
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:40:43
Check out the graph , its doing [pretty good]( I would say. Get ready to watch it go way up before [this]( future point in time ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:22:28
Bitcoin buyers and sellers don't give a shit what anyone says. This IS , right?
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:32:32
Never thought about it like that. I guess I do have something worth dollars as long as I sell to individuals and it is up there at $6k a pop. Just wish it would become easier to use , its very difficult in IOWA , the center of nothing
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:27:09
Karpeles did pay off in $$$ what he owed. That is what the lawsuits and bankruptcy was about. The folks he felt cheated fucked up by not providing an if else clause providing for "which ever is more, bitcoin or cash" . That's how courts look at it. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:03:02
good one! 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:07:51
why do I not believe it?
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:04:00
Yes, talking about bitcoin gold. Trying to see if I can get more or less than nicehash bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:33:26
more likely? Shit , that's all you find in the US Stock Market.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:12:03
You still can't just go out and buy shit with it. You can't pay bills, your mortgage , your gas -- basically your everyday things . Its fake money for buying stuff and more stuff. I am trying to see if there are schools that take bitcoin for payment, homes in my state that take bitcoin. No one takes bitcoin. Cash is still king
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:09:58
Unless you have a Trezor btc hardware wallet. Then you can carry usb anywhere , even lose it. All you will need is the Trezor hardware wallet to unlock any new installation
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:07:57
I guess we will have to use our ASIC hardware to mine bitcoin cash and buy some new hardware to mine BTG
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:27:47
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:10:06
To think that some  of us started mining in 2009 just for shits and giggles
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:11:14
Lock the seed words in a small notebook in a safe, Its the right thing to do. No one will know what those words mean ...
