You mean the global oil trade that will become non existant in 25 years? And if it doesnt then the human race is gonna go extinct anyway so this conversation doesn't matter.

That's really up to the individual. Gold retains value because it's rare. There's a finite amount of it. People use it though and combined with it being rare it, makes it very valuable.

It applies to both. But gold at least is rare and you can hold it in your hand.

Which is exactly what I fucking said? That they are based on faith... you're conveniently leaving out the fact that 90% of the population doesn't understand this. Fucking jackass.

Literally not what I said. I said it has value because people say it does. Not because its actually backed by anything. If we were still on the gold standard the u.s dollar would have an actual value attached to it.

Exactly like crypto except theres no middle man. If we are gonna use imaginary currency that has no intrinsic value then we might as well use one that can cut out banks and just be kept between two parties.

Yes... after we left the gold standard the value of the dollar became whatever value we put to it. It has no backing and the only reason it has any value is because we say it has value. That's the only reason. It only has worth because people literally think it does. Not because it actually does.
