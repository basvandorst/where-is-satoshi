Price is Increasing technically every hour, people hold their coin. many are not ready to sell. We should expect $4500 before the end of this week. Though I don't see it beyond that till this month end.

It's  a normal thing. If u have 1million different addresses, any coin sent to any of them is coming to your wallet. You can decide to use a new one everytime you wanna transact or use only one throughout. They are all VALID forever

What is gone is gone, it can't be reversed unless detected ad double spend by blockchain. You just have to wait a bit more for it to confirm on the blockchain server..
Next time u wanna spend, ensure u manually increase your TRANSACTION FEE, That will definitely speed up the confirmation on the server.

We hope that with BITCOIN, the world will be safe from Phishing spyware.

Increase your Transaction fee MANUALLY next time u wanna spend. The confirmation will b swift with that
