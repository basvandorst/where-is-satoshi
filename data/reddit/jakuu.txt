Why do you think they are on ATT?
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:07:11
Jailbreak and install the BlockChain.info app.

What fees? I pay the same price if I'm using cash or credit. I don't use my card when they charge extra. I am not paying anything extra so again others doing chargebacks does not effect me. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 20:26:17
If I buy something at MSRP and pay credit  or cash where do these fees come?
@_date: 2014-06-21 19:28:47
How? If I pay my card off in full every month, how do I pay for the others doing chargebacks?
@_date: 2014-08-12 04:40:44
Wonder what the return policy on it is...
@_date: 2015-01-25 08:48:48
Yeah, we shall see. Still working on that. Might end up going into a branch with him when he is visiting.
@_date: 2015-01-25 17:06:16
Yeah I know the person in real life. I wouldn't send money there if I didn't know them. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 08:48:14
Because he would have to link his bank account to it which would most likely take a few days and PayPal fees would take a decent amount as well. It wasn't just a few hundred dollars that was being sent either.
The wire transfer in theory should have been simple and without issues. We didn't expect his bank to steal the money.

 has been around for over a year providing this feature for streamers. We launched before StreamLabs had it and we will continue to provide this service for users.
We have a lot of plans in the works to integrate more platforms and even lighting, but currently are focused on other areas for streamers.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:19:36
What, no that's exactly how you get customers.
Oh, man so sorry the hack got detected. I'm working on a new version and previous buyers can get this one for half off!
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:47:20
Found the hacker!
All kidding aside, that's what many game modders do already. I mean other than the kidding napping turtle part. I think they are safe.
@_date: 2015-08-15 15:08:18
Too bad I live in IL. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 03:00:34
IL requires one in front and one in back. It sucks.
@_date: 2015-08-15 04:50:40
Well they exist. Mine for instance doesn't have one (Model S). Some have special brackets you can install but again require a drill in most cases.
@_date: 2015-08-15 04:18:09
A lot of cars won't have a place for it on the front. So for a lot of them you will need to drill into the front which isn't something you'd want to do on an expensive car.

Let it happen. The city is so much better with roads that are in a grid.
@_date: 2012-06-01 19:29:44
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:55:42
 is also an option. 
@_date: 2011-05-31 05:58:35
I don't have Windows currently on my boxes, but does this work with mining pools? Also is it CPU or GPU powered?
@_date: 2011-06-01 06:40:42
Release it!
I'm pretty sure someone has tried to make a BitCoin app before for the iPhone to check certain pools, but it was rejected by Apple. So hopefully you can release this or at least put it on Cydia.
@_date: 2011-05-31 06:09:44
Oh nice so I can have it launch anything else pretty much. That's nifty.
@_date: 2019-05-22 08:05:05
Yeah I get the whole we’re out banks thing. But the replies in this thread telling him to suck it up and this is what you get, is just wrong. 
We’re trying to get people to want to use this. Could you imagine if this was the first thread someone found and everyone was just saying OP is stupid because they made a mistake. I doubt they’d want to try it. 
Even if he made the mistake, show some compassion and just upvote him and move on. We shouldn’t be so harsh on him, he’s using a rather new technology and messed up, if they can reverse it great. If they can’t that’s fine too, it’s a costly mistake but at least he tried and got support from the community to get the right amount of attention on it.
@_date: 2013-03-08 17:59:08
I pay his girlfriend too.
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:35:29
I sent you a PM about one of my orders that isn't resolved almost 12 hours ago. I didn't feel like bring it up to you in a thread like this but can you please look into it?
@_date: 2013-04-17 17:27:26
Great. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:15:06
Which may or may not still take 24-48 hours to reply.
@_date: 2013-04-17 17:08:47
No, I got that email but that is it. No new status update on the event log for the page and no additional response from support.
I was expecting more "immediate attention" since that is what the message states. I have PMed you my Order ID.
@_date: 2013-05-04 20:51:48
I think you're gaining enough interest, you just need to let people have a some time with it first. I know you're prolly just excited at the thought of having people solve it, so you want to help.
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:53:15
Yes, I sent an email to support after 24 hours to find out the status of my order. I have yet to hear back from them as well. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-05-04 20:48:54
Tips this early doesn't make it much fun.
@_date: 2013-03-30 01:08:41
Did you pay in bitcoins? If so did they give you the coins back or just the USD amount it is now?
@_date: 2013-04-28 22:33:25
I'd love to try this out.
@_date: 2013-04-19 19:20:28
If it really was strong, I doubt a 12 GPU setup could still crack it in 14 minutes. Plus a rainbow table would be useless for decrypting wallets. The wallets all use a random master key along with your passphrase, so the rainbow table would need to account for every possible "random master key". That would take millions of years to create and would certainly be over 30GB.
But then again, depending on how "strong" his password really is, it could be decrypted with 12 GPUs. It just depends on if his password really was strong or not. So you could be right on that part. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:58:24
Really? You seriously just sent me that same message and I replied. It's now been over 60 hours and I haven't heard back from support and am only getting copy/pasted messages from you. This is kinda ridiculous. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 19:53:28
No it wouldn't. Look, a random table is a pre-computed list of passwords to hashes. So for simplicity let's say "A=1, B=2, C=3". You could make a nice rainbow table for that. But if we were to add a salt or a "random master key", so that "A + RND = 83, B + RND = 723, C + RND = 2823". You wouldn't be able to create a table of that since the RND would be a different value for every wallet. The rainbow table needs to be able to account for every salt/key as well as the users pass-phrase/password.
And yes, if your password is password it would crack super fast. A 12 character password is harder to crack than an 8 by a long shot, and 12 GPUs could crack it in seconds depending on the algorithm used. It comes down to how many different tasks it has to do to convert your 12 character password to the encrypted value. Some algorithms suck and can be cracked in seconds, and others are a bit stronger and help the security of the password. 
I've got 4 ATI 7970s, and it was going to take over 5 years to attempt to crack a 12 character password of a "Cached Domain Credential". So even if we add 3x as much hardware we would still have wait 2-3 years for it to 100% crack. So again, while the password it self helps, the algorithms helps a lot more.
Just checked with trying to crack a sha256, and it would be about the same time frame as cracking a "Cached Domain Credential". I even made the password simple, "123456789012" and it's taking its time. Plus, don't forget if the attacker did brute-force his password, he would attempt all lengths first. So he would have to try 1-11 before getting to 12, which would take time as well.
