Sounds like fake news. What airdrop?

I see it consolidating between 5k and 500,000 for the end of 2018. Anything in between is the "Me being intellectually superior" zone.
I am an expert. My opinions are really great. By the time 2018 comes around, remember this comment in this particular Reddit post. You will find out by then that I was right.

Fake News.
@_date: 2017-02-17 04:40:39
Really not a fan of some of the Social Darwinist bullshit that I'm seeing in the comments section.

He is for cutting military spending though. A dead clock can be right twice a day. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 01:24:33
Meh, Not sure about the exact number, but a bitcoin ETF should drive up more demand. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 02:20:58
This guy sucks. He wants to raise the retirement age. Did anybody actually read the article? Fuck this douche. I don't care if he is pro bitcoin. He has really shit politics.

Plot twist, that Wolong dude that pumped all those cryptocoins is also Mark Kepeles!

Key word: "Operating in the U.S". Therefore, Bitfinex for example does not need to comply because they are overseas, correct?

Right to Recovery token.
It sounds like, the RRT is for when they find the stolen bitcoins. Many people probably don't believe they will be found, hence the big discount. More info here:

Also, you really think the BFX tokens will go over $1?
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:30:00
Elaborate Setup.

You can also buy GBTC, which tracks bitcoin. I got in late, but still up 30%. Still has legs. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:09:22
endless loop for me reloading
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:24:44
It settled down a little. Failed pump? Rumor? idk.
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:22:31
Back for me now actually! Woohoo!

New England? See Level999. He has great feedback. 1000+ trades and 100% feedback. Sells in MA, ME, CT, VT, NH. Large amounts too. No ID. 
@_date: 2016-12-12 00:39:41
Yea, give him the cash and he'll give you bitcoin. He's wicked legit. I buy a lot from him every week. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:24:55
Are millennials KILLING BANKS!? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:49:17
Not making price go down though. If there was a reliable way for big money to short btc, the rice may go down.
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:48:40
He also has all that unclaimed BCH and BitGold too. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:41:09
Old news.
1. don't have addresses tied to identity
2. use Monero maybe
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:14:36
BT2 futures were going up, then they went down, and seem to be recovering.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:23:44
lololol what is a savings account?
@_date: 2017-04-05 03:13:17
Go to NJ and use the ATMs. I think they charge a little bit less than NYC. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 01:56:20
I agree. There will be another recession in a few years, and this deregulation nonsense will be a big factor.

Novo has been on fire. We need more bullish news. China will probably walk back their bitcoin ban, just like they always do. And then government insiders will load up. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:35:27
Unpopular opinion: He's pretty entertaining. I watch his stuff almost daily. Some of his videos are of good quality.  Would I pay for his stuff? Hell no. Everything he teaches in his paid courses is stuff you can learn for free, I'm pretty certain.

Unrelated to bitcoin, but this is my second time reading about Poznan today: 
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:29:13
You think it could be related to Cuba though? Travel is allowed in Cuba, and I'm pretty sure they are off the OFAC list, I could be wrong. But Coinbase is notorious for making you verify your shit

Hard stop at 2711. Praying it doesn't come to that!

Dump her for her cute Mexican friend, Monero.
