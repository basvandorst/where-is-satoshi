It’s hard to say if I would or wouldn’t have. Nothing ever came up where I had to dip into my savings that I would have had to sell to get the $1000 back. I had well over that amount in a stupid savings account earning no interest. I think there are lots of people that held through all of that.

Curious why you think that ripple is a scam coin? I just purchased some and feel like it has some utility.  I felt dirty buying it because I feel it goes against everything BTC represents.  nevertheless it was a pretty good deal and it is turning a profit if I sell.

@_date: 2018-01-14 00:28:48
The problem is, it is hard to admire someone who is so clearly unintelligent and only worried about his own self image and interests. I would be on board with a president that spoke his mind and didn’t “kowtow” to the PC leftists. The problem with Trump is his only means of doing this is to insult anyone who opposes him. That is not a solid platform for change and is not how you “make America great again”

I had a buddy this evening tell me bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. This is my best friend for 20 Years, a Tech guy who gets blockchain Tech but still says bitcoin is a fraud. I have finally just said you are right I can’t argue with you anymore. What’s frustrating is I know it is because he is salty cause he sold his 2 bitcoin back before it really exploded.

As others have stated I believe that cryptocurrencies Bitcoin being the one I firmly believe in need to become a store of value first.  Once that has settled down and it is not as volatile then it will become a viable currency. 
I also believe as others have stated that there are many MANY problems that need to be overcome. But I think with a global community of very bright and committed people these problems will be addressed. 
When the internet first became main stream the average person would use AOL or some other very simple rudimentary interface to access the "World Wide Web" and now look where we have progressed to? I wholly believe that we are just coming to the "AOL" stage of cryptocurrencies. That is not to say I believe Bitcoin is the same as AOL I would say exchanges like Coinbase or the AOL equivalent.

So funny that you say this.  I was introduced to BTC the exact same way.  Guy at my work mines cryptocurrency and said he wanted to give me $5 in bitcoin. I said sure why not what do I do.  He had me download coinbase and sent it to me.  a couple days later I bought $5 more. Now I have invested some savings that has been sitting in our Efund (not all of it) and own almost a whole coin. What makes me crazy is, a year or so ago I was talking to my buddy about how bitcoin had gone up to like $750 when he bought his for about $300.  I was about to buy one just to have it and decided not to.  Well woulda coulda shoulda I suppose. 
Edit: I wasn't introduced to bitcoin with the $5 I knew what it was.  I guess what I mean was I was introduced to the transnational part of bitcoin.

I am a Bitcoin believer. I turkey believe it is going to change the way we deal with money. That being said, I am not sure how this theory holds up. It is my understanding that if you own bitcoin you will have an equal amount of the new coin when the fork happens. Can’t true believers in bitcoin just dump the new coin to put pressure on the price?

I think you are seeing transaction times and fees in terms of what is going on today.  I think that if/when? bitcoin were to hit $1M/BTC the compute power as well as technological improvements will have addressed these issues causing the price to be $1M/BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:11:22
There is a sticky video on the front page of a talk AA gave talking about increasing block sizes as a solution. It seems to me that what he says makes sense. I know there is a solution to the issue but I dont think that increasing the block size is the correct one. At least it is not the long term solution, I think it is more important to find a long term solution now while Bitcoin is still in its infancy than to put something in place that wont support the type of growth we all want from the technology. I feel like there are some extremely smart people out there on both sides of this argument.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:05:05
I believe that bitcoin will be a store of value and become a long term investment. I think cryptos like BTC, ETH, and LTC will be currencies used for most transactions. But people will keep bitcoin as their chunk of the cheese, break pieces off to convert to other cryptos and use those for everyday purchases. That being said I am some random idiot on reddit shooting my mouth off. God I love the internet.

@_date: 2017-09-13 00:16:15
I guess to me this is how I became interested in bitcoin. A friend sent me $5 through coinbase and that sparked my curiosity. I then started dipping my toes buying bitcoin. Now I am a huge advocate for it. I guess to me it's not about them getting the $5 or not. It's about them learning what bitcoin is. If makes them curious and they begin doing research that's awesome it served its purpose.

Don’t invest anymore than you are willing to lose. No one knows if the price will rise or fall. There is no answer to your question other than yes/no/maybe, if you can afford to lose $1000 than buy bitcoin, if you cannot than don’t.  Read and do research about bitcoin then make a decision.

I am curious if you ever even served in the military? 
Im going to leave this here for you:
[Four star general: “I know something about the flag … put me down with Kaepernick”](
I will also leave this here for you:


Aug 14, 2016- Colin Kaepernick sits for the national anthem.....and no one noticed
Aug 20th, 2016- Colin again sits, and again, no one noticed.
Aug 26th, 2016- Colin sits and this time he is met with a level of vitriol unseen against an athlete. Even the future President of the United States took shots at him while on the campaign trail. Colin went on to explain his protest had NOTHING to with the military, but he felt it hard to stand for a flag that didn't treat people of color fairly.
Then on on Aug 30th, 2016 Nate Boyer, a former Army Green Beret turned NFL long snapper, penned an open letter to Colin in the Army Times. In it he expressed how Colin's sitting affected him.
Then a strange thing happened. Colin was able to do what most Americans to date have not...
He listened.
In his letter Mr. Boyer writes:
"I’m not judging you for standing up for what you believe in. It’s your inalienable right. What you are doing takes a lot of courage, and I’d be lying if I said I knew what it was like to walk around in your shoes. I’ve never had to deal with prejudice because of the color of my skin, and for me to say I can relate to what you’ve gone through is as ignorant as someone who’s never been in a combat zone telling me they understand what it’s like to go to war. Even though my initial reaction to your protest was one of anger, I’m trying to listen to what you’re saying and why you’re doing it." Mr. Boyer goes on to write "There are already plenty people fighting fire with fire, and it’s just not helping anyone or anything. So I’m just going to keep listening, with an open mind. I look forward to the day you're inspired to once again stand during our national anthem. I'll be standing right there next to you."
Empathy and understanding was shown by Mr. Boyer.........and Mr. Kaepernick reciprocated. Colin invited Nate to San Diego where the two had a 90 minute discussion and Nate proposed Colin kneel instead of sit.
But why kneel? In a military funeral, after the flag is taken off the casket of the fallen military member, it is smartly folded 13 times and then presented to the parents, spouse or child of the fallen member by a fellow service member while KNEELING.
The two decided that kneeling for the flag would symbolize his reverence for those that paid the ultimate sacrifice while still allowing Colin to peacefully protest the injustices he saw.
Empathy, not zealotry under the guise of patriotism, is the only way meaningful discussion can be had. Mr. Kaepernick listened to all of you that say he disrespects the military and extended an olive branch to find a peace.
When will America listen to him?
