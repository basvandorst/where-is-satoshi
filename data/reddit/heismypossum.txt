I would love if you found a way to donate to any of the refugee-related international charities, such as [The International Rescue Committee]( or the [UNHCR](
There is an incredible number of refugees and the United States is largely closing their borders to them. For reference, last year the budget was for 110,000 refugees. This year, President Trump has cut that to 45,000. However, because of several Executive Orders and bans, that number is only on pace to be about 15,000.
We have a lot of refugees in my area who are trying to reunite with their families. These are people who have spent years trying to track down family members in other countries, have spent multiple years going through all the vetting and processes, who are no longer going to be able to have their family members join them. It's heart-breaking, because many of them are new but now their families won't be able to follow them. In addition, President Trump also ended a program that allowed legal immigrants to bring their children (under 18) into the United States from Central America.
All of this was done in the name of national security and counter-terrorism. Which is sad, because out of the 3.2 million refugees resettled here since 1975, only 3 Americans were killed from terrorist acts, and there's no evidence to say they were brought here for that purpose, as some were brought here as children. These are the most vulnerable people in the world, and we have a system already in place that properly vets them and filters out bad actors. However, this program is being scaled back over 80% in just one year.
My wife works with these refugees and would be happy to share more information with you if you would like. We could both tell you stories about the things the refugees have told us and what their lives were like in the refugee camps. Some of them walk off a plane into the United States after not having electricity or running water for sometimes up to 15 years. Some of them are college-educated who have to take manual labor jobs because none of their education transfers here, but they do it because they love their family so much and will do anything to provide a good life for them. These people possess the greatest American spirit, willing to do anything to work hard for their family. They are really inspirational.
PM me if you wish to discuss anything further! I would be happy to share or discuss anything you would like!

I think this is just a silly idea. I honestly thought it was a joke until I read the bitcointalk thread. I don't know why some of these people are ever on the currency... We don't need "paper" like this anyway.
One of the beauties of bitcoin is that you don't have denominations anymore. You just have bitcoin. No reason to need to split it into these denominations.
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:58:52
Yes, but ideally this can be squelched.
It's sort of how Gox tempers were calmed a little bit because everyone in the bitcoin community just kept talking about how they'd known it was probably going to happen for a while. It certainly was still quite newsworthy and is still being talked about, but it's the attitude shift. I had people who were thinking it was the end of bitcoin, but when I calmly explained that it was known for a while, they understood and then were desensitized to later stories about it. The story lost traction pretty quickly in comparison to if we had no idea it was coming.
It's that quiet resolve that we all need, and just speak confidently that it doesn't matter... This man is already a target no matter what, but I don't want to add any fuel to the fire.

We have a group of us at work that love to get burritos at a local place in town.
However, it's about a 15 minute drive which stretches our lunch to an hour, sometimes more if it's busy.
We would LOVE to be able to send in our order, and have one person go pick it up, however, it's just not possible.
How the *hell* is payment going to work?
No one carries cash.
If they did, no one carries exact change for the order. What are people going to write CHECKS? Requiring the person to go deposit them at some point? (Not to mention giving out your bank account and routing number...) Oh, and everyone would have to have their checkbook with them... not likely.
Bitcoin would make this much easier. You figure out how much each person owes, stop by their desk with a QR code, they scan it, you're paid, all is well. Then you can go pay for the burritos without screwing anyone out of any money!
The more I think about how inefficient cash is (have to carry it around... pre-determined sizes of bills... never having exact change... etc.), the more angry I get whenever I use it.
I WANT BURRITOS WITHOUT USING MY WHOLE LUNCH BREAK DAMNIT!

There's plenty of reasons to bid over market price. Even outside the usual "you can't buy that many on the exchange for that price as quickly". 
Take coinbase for example. They buy coins often, but they also hold a lot. They knew this was coming, so they buy a lot of coins in the meantime. 
Then the auction rolls around. Say, just for simplicity sake, they bought them all for $700. The market will react and push the price up, which increases ALL of their holdings. It's an easy way to manipulate the market by making the average person think btc is worth more simply by publicly saying it is and betting a large amount on it. 
It currently is sorting as a price setting benchmark. If the coins are purchased for $550, price drops to 550 if not lower. Coins purchased for $650, market price will match that too.
If the coins sell for more than exchange price... You can't think that the price is going to go DOWN.

Some of them really aren't. I mean yes, all the answers are intelligent and important, but not necessarily to the general public.
I'm thinking the ones that they can connect to, such as talking about credit cards and who you are actually trusting every time you use it. And some of the broader questions of what is the blockchain etc. Even the rougher answers where he says that the only way to secure bitcoin currently is with great technical knowledge and difficulty. I hate when people say that "it's so easy". It really isn't for your average user. It fits in perfectly with his previous answer about email. It used to require UNIX command-line knowledge. To users in the industry, it probably wasn't that hard. But to people who have no foundation, it's highly difficult. That's where bitcoin is now.
Also, to circle back to your original question, I'm 100% ok with the questions being included when they are relevant for context.

I think it mostly has to do with your tone, not content. Things like 




No it isn't. It seems absurd to you because you believe in it. It is not out of the realm of possibility, and thus that statement immediately damages your credibility, and sets up a hostile tone. A lot of phrases have sort of hidden hostility in them. "You think...", "Just wait until...", etc.
Even your last line


comes across as basically a "Fuck you if you don't agree because you're wrong."
This is definitely not the right way to introduce people to it. Your downvotes show it as well.
Sorry to be blunt, but you're coming off as someone who thinks he/she is smarter than the people he/she is talking to. It's very off-putting, and it makes people far more likely to downvote/call you out. I certainly wouldn't want to be talked to this way, and sure as hell wouldn't listen to what you have to say. You really need to work on meeting people at their level, and not coming off as "above" them.

This is the fundamental flaw with merchants.
The incentives for merchants are lower fees than CCs right?
Well you can't get rid of CCs. And the only way to incentivize people to use BTC is to pass on those savings... which again negates your incentive for the merchant to use it.
@_date: 2014-10-07 18:32:18
Because credit cards are the default option (at least in the US). People won't just move just because. They'll only move if they are incentivized. The only incentive they can get would be negating the merchant incentive to save.
Basically what I'm saying is that the lower fees can only benefit one party. If the merchants keep the savings from lower fees, the consumer has no reason to switch. If the savings are passed onto the consumer, the merchant has no reason to switch.
The only way it works is if the merchant can pass on the savings AND increase volume... but with bitcoin still not being very widely used, it's simply not going to pick up the volume enough to justify it. Yes I know some places have had $1,000,000+ in btc sales, but that's a drop in the bucket for most of these companies.

I hope you get back to the black and all (I don't wish you ANY ill-will), and that they pay for your debt in the interim, but you should seriously NEVER EVER go into credit card debt to invest. It's basically equivalent to taking out a loan to give to someone else to gamble with.

I don't use the opposite, so I might not be the best one to ask.
The process for Coinbase or Circle is simple:
Step 1) Go to website, register
Step 2) Enter bank account information
Step 3) Confirm it (they deposit 2 small amounts to ensure you entered it correctly, takes 2-3 business days because banks)
Step 4) Buy. Up to $500 (on Circle) is available immediately. but daily limit is much higher.
I believe on Circle you can do it instantly with a credit card as well, but there is a 2.9% fee imposed by Credit Card companies.

I think the market has grown too large and stable for even something like this to cause a large upswing.

It's about ease-of-use. You have to understand that it is definitively better for some people to use Coinbase or Circle. I'm not arguing that it is more secure overall, you're spot on with that.
However, for people who don't fully understand the intricacies of bitcoin and how to secure it, they're far less likely to screw up with Coinbase or circle. As for Coinbase, they have yet to have any major wide-reaching breach, so they seem to be decent for now. For your average person who doesn't know a lot, they are good options.
Yes, I know it's not as safe as it could be, but it's kind of like trying to tell someone to build their own PC. Yes it CAN be better (and/or cheaper), but the idea that the extra knowledge needed (in this case that they would screw up and lose money somewhere in the process), isn't worth the extra steps.

Can someone help me out here? I'm missing one step. I don't have any bitcoin yet because I didn't trust any online stuff.
If I have coins on an online site, such as Coinbase, how do I get them offline for printing? Is it just a file that I download? How do I get those coins into my possession securely?
Once I have them on, say, a flash drive, can I just pop in the CD into an offline computer, follow the instructions, and print out my wallet? Would you suggest printing multiple wallets, or can I put all my BTC in one? What's the maximum amount you would put into one wallet?
On your site, you mention that withdrawing some of your btc can destroy the entire amount minus what you just took out. What are the odds of this happening?
If I buy into bitcoin, I just feel unsafe putting a few thousand dollars into something like this where I'm being told that it's not safe online, but if you take it offline you could just lose it all.

How is this not on the front page? This is WAY more important than TigerDirect or Newegg accepting bitcoin!
This is another layer above that! NCR has a (and I'm using the technical term here) metric fuckton of clients. Shit, even 2 local bars in my local town of 50k people use NCR Silver (or something very similar). That means they kind of accept bitcoin now too. Awesome stuff! The systems and infrastructure are already there with a company like NCR.
This is even bigger than PayPal. This, to me, is the biggest news we've heard in a very, VERY long time. I don't want to say I'm "bullish", as I'm disinterested in the price of bitcoin, but this is a BIG step for the technology!

I respectfully call bullshit. Everything you put above is just garbage.
1: No one's data is being sold... lemme see here


So I guess *technically* **maybe** not being sold *currently*. Whenever you want to though it's totally cool since we already agreed to let you.
2: You only have access to the data that you explicitly grant? Oh I think there was something about that...


Again... I guess *technically* we are giving you explicit permission, but you certainly shouldn't be looking at my browsing history. No reason to. No reason to track any of it.
3: 


Then fucking fix it. Don't ask us to come along for the ride while you decide all of this shit. This is not a sign up for a broken product that you can choose to fix later. We want something that's designed correctly from the start.


No one here gives a shit what you did in the past. We're talking about THIS product now. And from what you've shown, it sounds like you should know better. You **KNOW** that this is the type of shit that everyone hates about these services. You're WAY overstepping your bounds.
Bottom line dude, you admitted that the privacy policy sucks. Then you said "Oh these are things we **might** do." Well with the way it's worded, agreeing now means agreeing that you can turn the key any time you want.
Don't come around and make this post and talk about how nothing is happening *right now*, admit that the policy is shit, and try to say you're some privacy hero. You're **NOT** helping the community with this. This is a huge step backwards. If you reply, please explain to me how in the world any of this is necessary, specifically what I quoted in points 1 and 2.
You've probably already fucked this up and opened the door for someone else. I sure as hell won't be using your product anymore, even if you do make changes. You broke the one primary thing you need in a community: Trust.

I just hope the media finds that there's nothing to be gained by harassing him.
If we get all up in arms anytime someone tries to get a comment from him, or if they do get comments and we all freak out saying "It's not the real Satoshi!", none of that matters. It's still getting the attention they crave. You think that any of the talking heads on TV are as crazy as they are on TV? Hell no. But they speak to a polarized one side because people get passionate and either defend them or argue against them... either is good for their show.
If we sit back and show that we don't care about this guy because we don't believe it's real, then maybe it'll lose traction more quickly and this guy can get back to his life.
And if it is the real Satoshi, then I REALLY hope this strategy works better. He deserves his anonymity. I'm doing what I think is best to try and restore that to some semblance of what it used to be.

Not a lot of downward pressure. Remember, it would take a TON to create that amount. If they sold 100btc a day, they'd be making $31 million a year on bitcoin alone. If that happened there would be plenty of buys to neutralize it.

Oh right, I'm not saying we found it for them, I'm saying, hopefully, we made them say "oh shit they know that we have this".
Given your analogy, not that we found the safe for them, rather we showed them that we knew the safe existed and how much was inside. So instead of playing the "we don't know where the btc is", we said, we know exactly where it is, so either you lost the combination or you lied about losing them. We more or less proved that we knew they weren't stolen.

I don't think it'll affect the price much. If people order $100k in products, that's less than 150 btc in a sell. Drop in the bucket... that is if the volume ever picks up.

What about other items? I wouldn't pay CG if I bought something from Overstock.com for example right?
@_date: 2014-09-29 13:46:00
I'm not transferring because if there's 1 thing that I value above all else, it's security.
I don't care if I pay another 1% when I sell. Security is worth it. The Vault function on Coinbase is where my coins are and where they will stay. Perhaps I will purchase some new things on Circle, but I don't want to transfer these things to a website that has less experience (for the time being).

Dear god you people. It fucking went up from $200 to $285 in a week!
You can't constantly have the highest price stick. Somehow people think we're going to go $250, $260, $260, $260, $280, $300, $300, $300, $325, etc.
It doesn't work like that. Whenever it rises and falls quickly, it goes a little too far then pulls back. It looks more like $250, $265, $255, $260, $280, $315, $300, $285, $290, $300, $280.
It can't just constantly go up.
Focus on the fact that we've gone up $85 in the last week or so, not that we fell $15 in a couple of minutes.
You can't have it all.
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:59:32
Any time :)
I used to freak out watching the markets, wondering why my investments weren't just going through the roof all the time. That's why I started trying to make sense of what all the information out there meant, so I could MINIMALLY explain what happened. If I ever figure out how to forecast outward, then I'll become a trader ;)
It also all boils down to the fact that markets are irrational by nature. No one can predict it. No computers, no models, nothing. It's all up in the air constantly, so speculation and hindsight are pretty much all we have for sure.
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:49:01
I think you are just experiencing a disconnect on how the market works during these times.
*Disclaimer: I am a holder, not a trader. I know one side of the coin, but not the other. Please correct me if this is incorrect.*
From my point of view, there's 2 kinds of people in the market. Long-Term Holders, and Traders. Obviously this is an over-generalization, but those are the two major categories.
**Long-term Holders Buying Habits**
This is a group that pretty much only buy, rarely, if ever sell. I'm in this group. I think they generally believe in the long-term outlook of bitcoin, and are in it for the long haul. We're not traders by nature, but we like hearing bitcoin news. We tend to buy near local minimums. We like to increase our position for as cheap as possible, since our end-goal isn't really changing.
**Traders Buying Habits**
Traders are a different breed. They come in all shapes in sizes. Some think similarly to Holders that bitcoin is the future. Their goal is to increase their position by buying low and selling high, in order to re-buy near the bottom. They like increasing their *BTC* position. Then there's the "bears" as we like to call them, or people who think bitcoin is doomed. They like to sell high as well, but ultimately are looking to get out after making a few bucks. They are looking to increase their *cash* position.
**What happened today?**
Basically, there was big rumors of an exchange coming through, which we now know as Coinbase Exchange. Assuming this is a major US exchange, the price really only goes up, as people can buy more easily, but few are likely to transfer in a lot and sell. On the rumor, people anticipated the market shifting upward, and bought in. Hence the price increase leading up to the announcement.
Then the announcement hits, and the price is STILL going up. Some holders may be jumping in, thinking "To the moon!" is coming. They buy and the price goes up and up. Traders are also establishing long positions, the whole reason they bought anyway. Bear and Bulls alike are setting up longs.
The price reaches $300, and the volume starts getting thin. There's no longer massive walls holding up the price, so volatility increases a lot. Some traders decide to get out, thinking this might be the top, so the price stabilizes for a short while. Others, sensing the stagnation, know the price is going to retrace a bit, as 50% growth is just not sustainable. Shorts are established. Everyone plays a game, trying not to be [the greater fool]( and is getting out. The price begins to retreat.
No one has confidence that the market will support a $300 price, since the trip there was so brief. No one wants to buy now because the price stopped going up. Bears are shorting, bulls are selling at the top to re-buy, and holders have stopped buying. This creates a retracement as you will see people say.
Now we're left with this volatile price while no one knows where the price is "supposed" to be. All we really know was that $210 was too low, and over $300 was too high. The market is struggling to find where that "even" point is. Everyone is making guesses now, and the price is going up and down a lot as people are buying/selling amounts trying to get in and out of the market. Everyone is trying to make money, but some people make more money when the market goes down. Others sell at the top, and increase BTC position when the price falls, so they aren't exactly unhappy either.
The only real worries come from Holders, who just want to see the price go up. Traders love volatility. The more volatile, the more money you can make. If the price is wavering $5-$10... there's not a lot they can do. If it's going up and down by 10% on the hour, they can make a ton off that 10% EACH hour if they call it correctly. More money to be made.
It's the ebb and flow of the market and human (ir)rationality. Right now, everyone is just trying to figure out what the right price is, and trying to make money in the process.
**How do you know all this? You don't even trade!**
I don't. But I read a lot of and watch the markets closely. I don't trust myself enough to predict the future, but I've gotten to a point where I feel like I can explain the past/present.
Hopefully that helps explain it for you!

I understand how big 150 billion is on that scale 
The fundamental mistake you're making is comparing two things that aren't equal. 
Comparing my personal wealth to the global economy doesn't make any sense. That's like saying, "if I could grab .00001% of the global economy, I'd be a millionaire! And that's just a drop in the bucket for that economy! Should be easy!" 
You can see how the parallel doesn't add up. Just because it's a small percentage doesn't mean it's easy to get our that someone will just throw that money around.
No person, entity, or group would invest that much at once. It'd be a guaranteed lost investment, as every person would sell like crazy.
This is known as the "1% fallacy". I highly suggest you read the following link with an open, objective mind:

Thanks! I don't think I'm going to cover mining much. The basic idea is that I'm going to try and show a visual representation of the blockchain, and that things build one block and top of another.
I'll stay pretty high-level on it, but my goal was to get people to understand that the "book keepers" (miners) who validate the transactions get rewarded with new bitcoin. They don't need to know all the details of how things are validated and who is chosen, just that they have a decentralized group of people that all agree on every transaction.

That's not how statistics work. If bitcoin had a .00001% chance of surviving this long, and .0001% chance of reaching $1,000,000 per btc from today, the fact that it is surviving doesn't make it any more likely. Total false equivalence there.

I'm in this boat. I hate gift cards, unless it's somewhere that I spend money anyway. Personally for me, that's Amazon or Steam. But those are kind of thoughtless "default" gifts anyway. It's just kind of like, "Here, go buy yourself something".
I absolutely hate anything that requires me to carry around the actual gift card.
I got married this year, and cash was pretty much the go-to, which was incredible. We haven't used several of the gift-cards we got because we don't really shop that often at places like Bed Bath and Beyond. And a wedding is 100% a place where cash is ok to get.

Obviously that was in jest :-P
I edited the above to let others know.
I would suggest you lead with the information that this is for *government* compliance.  Your original email stated: "We need to request a copy of your photo ID first, and then we can send the funds back to the original address that you deposited them from. Please send us a copy of your photo ID at your earliest convenience so that we can resolve this issue as soon as possible."
It just wasn't very clear, hence my hesitation. As someone who has had their identification documents leaked, you can surely realize why I'm extremely hesitant about just emailing a photo ID to a company just because they asked for it. Several emails later you clarified what this was being used for, which totally changes how it is viewed! If you would have led with that information, I certainly would have complied right away :)
@_date: 2016-09-10 15:59:53

Oh it won't... because it'll just be another wallet in your Coinbase account. They already allow this, and it would be no different. The fees would only apply to services outside of Coinbase (because they can't do those off-chain, they have to use the blockchain and thus there are transaction fees).

@_date: 2015-02-12 20:38:23
I think the opposite. I don't think bitcoin is going to exist in a "pure" form for quite some time, if ever. This could just be a fundamental difference in our viewpoints that we won't resolve, but we can at least have some good discourse in the mean time.
People are going to need wallets. Where they need wallets, they need security. Yes, I agree that you should be in charge of your own security, but people won't be. People will use the easiest proven service around, which to date I believe is Coinbase. People will want a service to host their wallet, just like they need a service to host your own email. Yes it would be more secure to set these things up manually... but people won't. It requires too much effort and/or expertise.
Therefore, I think third party services like Changetip or Coinbase will be very relevant for a long time. People will use them because they are easy and available.
@_date: 2015-02-12 21:40:42
That makes a lot of sense.
And yes, it'll be better if they are this closely intertwined to just label it as what it is with an acquisition. I'm going to take a few of these points and add to the evidence section above.

I think too many people are against the idea of another "AOL". AOL was amazing for the industry. Yes, it was shit software, it put a hold on broadband and made dial-up stick around for way too long, and yes charging people by "minutes" online seems insane.
HOWEVER, the important thing is what happened. Everyone got an email address. Everyone had a common platform to communicate (instant messaging/buddy lists). Everyone was familiar with a web browser and what it did.
Fragmentation and innovation happened *AFTER* the mass adoption. Which is totally fine. After everyone was familiar, better services came along for each one. But the key is unifying everything under one roof FIRST to teach people how these things work together. Then you can work on breaking out and perfecting each piece.

I don't know why you are trying to use Coinbase anonymously. It's not what it is about, and doesn't advertise that it is either. You should not be surprised that this is happening. If you want to be anonymous, find a service that allows anonymity.
As alluded to above, it's like going to Reddit and complaining that it's not totally anonymous like 4Chan because you have to give a username to up/downvote.
This is not the service you are looking for. Use something else.
@_date: 2015-02-18 22:44:09
ITT: Fuck Coinbase because they aren't exactly what I want.
Why are all of you hating so hard on CoinBase? I get it. It's the opposite of anonymous, they charge fees, and they probably grew a little too fast.
**If you're interested in anonymity and low fees, don't use them!**
I'm sick of everyone trying to say fuck coinbase because they aren't what I want. I want to hold my private keys (which they let you do now anyway...), but I don't have it set up so fuck them they're terrible.
I get it. They've had some customer service issues with buys being reversed etc. and don't let you send bitcoin to "shady" services that they determine. I think the frequency of these seems to have gone way down (inb4 string of request tickets).
Again! Then don't use them!
I use them because they're the easiest thing I've found, and are by far the most secure. They've never been hacked, and I hold all of my own bitcoin anyway.
They are a good company for what they do. Stop bitching because they aren't what *YOU* individually want.
*This is seriously like going on the internet and going on a tirade against Tumblr or Buzzfeed because they aren't what you want them to be. Don't fucking use them then. Problem solved.*

I know you think you're tipping me, but you're actually just tipping the person I feel the need to pass it along to. Whether it's 10 bits or 100000 bits, I won't keep a bit of it (Puns!) and there's nothing you can do about it.
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:06:05
Interesting. I don't know which way to lean. This could be pro-acquisition, just that it isn't happening as quickly as they wanted (perhaps not enough tipping was occurring), or anti-acquisition that they've had this plan for a long time, and they are just matching market forces, but the delays are coming because they want more users before fees come into play.

Yeah, you're totally in the right. If the other guy can't come up with a better argument than that he's anti Trans, then he hasn't even done a cursory look over of the guy.
Not worth arguing with imo. From the first sentence he projected that he has a very shallow opinion that can't be based on much more than headlines.
I'm not even a big fan of Jordan Peterson, but hot damn this is like saying you disagree with Obama because he's a Kenyan Muslim. I'd just move on lol

Ok then. Here's my public bank: Dupaco Community Credit Union.
Please send me $1. I'll pay you $5 back.
BitCoin can do that. Public information only. I don't think your bank can. And I can do it to anyone, anywhere.
EDIT: Also, just post your routing number and account number and I'll send you money first.
@_date: 2015-02-12 21:41:10
Very true. All good points.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:38:49
Sure, I don't **know**, but then again no one can because no one knows the real value.
The thing is, with every speculative currency, the price sails, and then people collectively decide that it's too high. One big sell sends everyone into a frenzy, and then it flash crashes because everyone is on edge.
I promise you that some sort of crash is coming. It is growing too quickly. Thinking otherwise is foolish.
The overall value is still growing don't get me wrong, but exponential growth never works out. Eventually it will regress to a linear scale.

I suggested it to a few developers, but no one took me up on it, so I'm letting anyone take the idea.
I think putting BTC into bars would be a HUGE deal, and it's one of the few places where BTC actually alleviates a lot of problems. Bars are notoriously tough to get drinks etc. and it makes it easier on both the bar and the patrons.
BTW, if you make this app into a thing, I expect some BitCoin kick back after you make your first million X-D
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:16:09
Pay attention. As you can see with my other posts it's certainly looming. I'll be interested to see if it hold near $800 or tanks down another $40.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:14:43
Still heading downward. It'll keep swinging because the spread is wide.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:20:28
It may not be done yet... volume is still razor thin.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:12:33
Just dropped another $15. Told you it was close.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:03:52
Downvote all you want... watch the BitStamp market.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:36:01
Fuck this Ernie Allen guy.
"We need to expose the IP of the addresses of those abusers of child pornography."
That sentence basically makes me think that he doesn't even understand what he's talking about.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:07:00
It'll probably drop a little more than 800, but it'll stay relatively high I would guess. Weekends are crazy.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:09:13
Starting to swing wildly up and down... It's going to tank very soon.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:05:09
My bad...
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:49:27
My roommate purchased humble bundle for me via webstream :)
I mean he was at work 10 minutes away... but the distance is irrelevant which is the best part.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:18:46
Oh yes, long term it will certainly be above 800 in a week.
But if you're looking to capitalize on the swing, you would be up $35 by selling when I made the post.
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:42:39
Odd question... But marketing. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:10:37
Huge ticks up to 815 and down to 800... This is bad news.
@_date: 2013-06-18 20:48:24
Is there anyway around it? Could he try and get a loan with a lower down payment and maybe a higher interest rate (hopefully not) and then just put this money into it once it is "seasoned".
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:04:57
Wait a few hours until this kind of evens out. It'll be a little while until you buy. I certainly wouldn't buy right now... Too volatile.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:03:08
Cannot be expressed, but it's dropped ~$10 since I made this post 5 minutes ago and looking to drop further.
I also made a post predicting the big drop... I was a good 5 minutes in front of the big drop and I got down-voted there too.

Again, no one went broke taking profits.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:12:19
I'm sorry but it's true. I can't type out everything flying through my brain right now. It's based on experience with the market and studying.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:53:14
That's a cool idea.... wish we had it in the States. 
But can you send it outside the country?
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:29:58
Thanks again for doing this. This is absolutely fantastic!
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:43:18
That sucked. He sounded like he was talking about a completely different issue.
BitCoin != "Internet Anonymity"
@_date: 2013-06-18 20:56:01
Also, does all money have to be seasoned?
It doesn't have to be if you can prove the source correct? 
I found this: Any large deposits made during the two months of statements, needs a satisfactory sourced with supporting documentation to prove these funds belong to the borrower and are not a loan.
Any large deposits that do not have a satisfactorily source are “not seasoned” and will not be considered the borrower's funds.  These unseasoned funds do not count towards mortgage qualifications and cannot be used in getting a mortgage. [source](

WAY too much to explain in a Reddit post...
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:07:41
I'm not good enough to just throw out highs and lows... but volume is going to pick way up in the immediate future. I can do some real time stuff if you'd like.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:16:54
Doesn't that make it a nightmare if it crashes because they're ALREADY under-valued?
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:14:17
That's the thing!! It doesn't matter if it's across the street or across the world. And it can be done for dumb shit!
Do you know how much it sucked to pay rent in college? I had to find my checkbook, spend a few minutes writing it, then my landlord had to come over, pick it up (which means I had to be home), then go deposit it, and THEN it would be withdrawn from my account in a few days, so I had to be sure I had a full month's rent in there at ANY moment.
Bitcoin is SO MUCH BETTER.
