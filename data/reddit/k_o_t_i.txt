A very large portion of the world has no access to banking.  They have no access to a credit line.  You come across as a "professional victim" complaining that interest rates on movies and restaurants are too high.  Why are you financing fast food, Starbucks, netflix when you should be investing in your financial freedom?  Live within your means.  Have a savings and stay away from pety debt purchases.  Do this instead of having a sense of entitlement.

This is my humble opinion.  Duplicate posts don't bother me.  I'm fine with it.

You are new but you use the phrase "always significantly different".  If you've watched crypto for years then you know that's not the case.
We are seeing extremely high volitivity right now.  Sites like that average the cost of btc between a lot of worldwide exchanges.  Bitcoin can be trading for $15000 in Korea  and $18000 in Europe.  It averages all the exchanges and give you a ball park number.  Sometimes its off compared to the exchange youre looking at.  Definately not "always" as you have wrote.

The difficulty is rising so it will be harder to get those returns.  Plus new faster miners are in development and when they launch the difficult spikes even more.  Plus youre buying mining equipment that is used.  It can burn out or fail and then have nothing.  Just buy coins.

The buy and sell walls are moving fast.  By the time you setup an account and transfer funds from your bank (which can take weeks on some exchanges) the market can shift.  Coinbase makes it easier to buy today for a new person but you pay a higher price.  Gdax is their sister company that has low fees but it can take a couple days to setup.

Fuck you...get a job.   You're worse than a bum on the street.  At least a bum will look you in the eye, face to face.

You remember when the government stopped us from downloading  stranger things season 2 on torrents?
Yeah i don't remember that either.
You remember when the government stopped marijuana consumption?
Yeah i don't remember that either.
Bitcoin is like 100 times harder to stop.  No central authority to raid.  Theres bitcoin satelites orbiting now relaying the blockchain.  You can hide private keys 1000s of ways.

I got my Trevor in the mail today.  It has a rattling noise coming from the inside.  Here's a video of it. 
Did you update the Trevor firmware?  I guess there was security issue they fixed but you need to update it's firmware.

Buy on coinbase and transfer to a mobile or desktop wallet.  Hardware wallets are considered "warm wallets".  They are still vulnerable.  If you want true "cold storage" then use a paper wallet that is generated on a fresh install Linux machine that has never been online.

This post will surely make a difference.  Good on you for seizing the day.

Yes,  your best move would be to blindly go all in on something you don't understand.

Reddit looks very unprofessional too.  Shitty interface, shitty looking, boring, and dull.  Yet millions of people use it.  As long as it functions then people will come.
There's lots of websites that look professional on the outside but hardly work on the inside.
People use what works...being "professional looking" is far down on the list.
So yes, you're the only one that feels that way.

Does bitcoin have a centralized person like Bernie Madoff controlling everyone's funds?  Serious question.
