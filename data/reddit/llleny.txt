That dude calling anything a scam is actually quite funny.

Stop buying games on steam and let them know.

Yes they are doing an awesome work on abandonwares, those old magnetic media they are stored on are starting to fail, and will most probably disappear without this effort. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 05:02:25
And the dump following 
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:11:55
Thanks I'll try to understand that. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:00:26
Not sure what are the requirements and process, my guess is simply having a business registration. A one guy business took money off my account like that... 
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:17:59
Why can't you find the key of the receiving addresses?... 
@_date: 2019-03-15 12:02:43
Anyone tried? What is the "can send -20 000"?  How to get back a deposit that would be below 20000?
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:16:47
What baffles me with sepa is that anyone who has my account number can take money out of my bank account without my agreement. It's just crazy. Then have to fight with the bank to have it refunded. If you don't check your account carefully enough you can get screwed pretty easily.

I don't understand well enough quantum algorithmic to be able to grasp that yet. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 17:27:19
Still closed sources? No thanks. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:28:29
Then you have the one resuming the thread. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:50:07
You should get a professional to do it, just give him 200k it's still a good deal. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:50:42
Or 122,950 BTC? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:33:29
But with hypothetically unlimited computing power can't we address -&gt; public -&gt; private? 
It's not mathematically impossible it's just difficult today because of the hash right? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:19:27
No this is not. More well funded speculators on bitcoin are not good news. What would be good news is if I could pay my bread or my electricity with btc. 
@_date: 2019-04-30 22:50:12
Doesn't make any sense, what about bitcoin and strawberry jam?
@_date: 2018-11-22 10:25:30
Got some Intel? 
@_date: 2019-01-06 10:18:48
Good way to get btc without kyc when you're not too much regarding of the fees. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:09:22
You deserve to be higher. Those hodl only advices are toxic. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 22:17:29
What about anonymity, cash laundering, etc. . This has a cost... 
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:04:55
Awesome. I didn't spend so much time on it and was obviously not as efficient as you. Congratulations.
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:43:48
No, paying that tax doesn't give you the right to French Healthcare. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:07:26
Yes exactly, you can be French living abroad, have to that crazy tax and get nothing. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:10:21
Not sure, what if you cash out on a French account? 
@_date: 2018-04-09 03:18:39
We're over the buy bitcoin we should be at use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:22:25

Yeah metal can't go through. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 10:54:25
The universal law of crypto?
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:09:25
Am I below 200?!
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:10:07
With the amount of news that need to be confirmed lately it may take some time. 
@_date: 2019-05-24 11:18:12
And hoping to escape taxes by using btc!!
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:43:30
