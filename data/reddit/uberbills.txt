I think all physical coins make great collector items and they also hold real bitcoins which in most cases, increase the value of the coin. They make more of a novelty piece and I think helps a newbie user to understand the basic fundamentals of public and private keys as well as the importance of using offline wallets to keep hackers at bay.
The most interesting one I have come across so far is the Nastyfans minted seat. Each 1oz or 5oz silver minted seat coin collects bitcoin shares from the nasty mining pool, thus you could say that you would get an unlimited amount of bitcoin over time. 
If you are going for more of an art piece, then Kialara is the way to go and it is quite popular at the moment. The most latest version has a glass encased coin which has a small scale labyrinth with silver/ceramic ball bearings. Very addicting and fun to pass the time with. 
Denarium is hard to come by mainly because they will not ship to the US.
Here is the list of coins that I follow: 
BTC: Casascius, Kialara, Nastyfans, Microsoul
LTC: Lealana, Cryptovest.
@_date: 2015-06-02 20:56:55
That is correct, Lealana now is unloaded, but you can still buy the loaded (LTC) ones from sellers. 
Microsoul is also funded and it comes from the UK. I am kind of surprised that they aren't as popular as the others because they are nicely made coins.

Oddball shapes would be cool to collect!
@_date: 2014-07-15 01:49:36
I guess I will use it in my bitcoin memorabilia collection.

I had an opportunity to buy one of the gold coins back in 2012 for around $20k. Considering one of those coins sold for $1 million in 2013, I should have gotten a loan. Current worth: $521,300.
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:51:00
It very well could be! I like the ring!

Good question! I will try to see if I can fit this data into the tables. 
According to my scans, In 2013 there are 3,536 Silver coins minted in total. I will break them down below:
0.1 BTC: 760
0.5 BTC: 916
1.0 BTC: 1,757
10 BTC:  103
In 2012 there were 290 10-BTC Silver coins and in 2011 there were 96.
I hope this answers your question! Have a great weekend!

Very cool, glad to hear of more Casascius coins!
@_date: 2014-08-17 04:35:59
Mike is a good guy. If only I could make the trip to Utah, I would buy some coins off of him in person.

Hello flybird365! 
I personally have many physical cryptocoins in my collection however the best ones I've seen so far are: Casascius, Lealana, NastyFans, Microsoul and CryptoVest. All of which can be found on ebay. Casascius being the priciest and CryptoVest being the cheapest. 
However, most coins are shipping with zero crypto-coin value, meaning that you would have to purchase 1 Bitcoin and load it onto the coin via it's public address.
Good luck!
@_date: 2014-08-28 01:15:13
I think in 150 years, 1 BTC will be worth 12 coffee tables. :)
All silliness aside, I really do not know. I sold most my bitcoin when it was $32, and here we sit at $500. I say to the moon!
@_date: 2014-04-02 23:20:28
Nice work!

The last I heard, you would have to travel to the great state of Utah and meet him in person to purchase unfunded casascius coins.
@_date: 2014-09-02 02:06:07
Hey, this is really cool! Would you be interested in a 3rd party analyzer website to track your coins, much like the Casascius Bitcoin Analyzer?
@_date: 2014-12-16 05:03:05
One could say that the name "bit coin" in itself is misleading, yet helps the average Joe and Grandma understand what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2014-04-12 01:23:12
If you have at least 3 letters or numbers that are consecutive, you can find your full public Casascius Bitcoin Address by typing it into the casascius.uberbills.com search bar at the top of the page. If your entire public address is wiped off your hologram, don't worry! Only the Private address under the hologram is needed to get your bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 01:22:24
Hello, When I purchased my collection of "broken" casascius bitcoins, they all arrived with the hologram peeled then stuck back on. The paper disc that came with them was yellowish in color so I would not trust this to hold the private key for 1CseAFP. You may want to contact Mike aka casascius himself to see if he can remember using clear sticker as a test. If he confirms it as one of his test coins, then this very well may be a rare find.
Good luck!

Thank you for such a fine product. It is truly unique as a physical bitcoin and I am sure many will cherish it in their collection. 
I would like to suggest checking out  as to a way to donate back to Bitcoin.

Nastyfans has some neat 1 gram silver coins as well as 1 oz and 5 oz coins (with holo and key). Ebay is flooded with them, usually $5 each.
@_date: 2015-05-11 01:47:30
But they sure are neat to have! :)
@_date: 2014-10-05 04:22:13
Thanks for the ref! :)
@_date: 2014-06-19 02:43:56
Heh, I paid my friend a 1 btc coin and in exchange I got a $5 Taco Hell box meal. He sold it 2 years later for over $800! FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-

He who plunders ye gold shall perish. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 23:18:01
ebay sucks. Lets move over to a btc only marketplace like  or back to the bitcointalk marketplace (ugh).
@_date: 2014-07-17 10:06:03
You have to trust the manufacturer since they created the public and private key as well as engraved the coin with the private key under the hologram. 
You can verify a nastyfans balance now at (shameless plug) my new analyzer  as well as check the public address at blockexplorer.
I think the NastyFans coin is a neat idea because it will continuously receive bitcoins and it doubles as a cold storage wallet.
@_date: 2014-07-17 10:27:52
Below is the thread over at bitcoin talk. I think there is a video of a coin being engraved but no one has posted about peeling a hologram and redeeming. I would like to see as well but that would mean ruining one of these nifty coins. I'm not brave enough... yet. ;)
@_date: 2014-12-11 02:29:34
eBay is a great place to sell Casascius Bitcoins. Be sure to put restrictions in place such as only accepting bids from users with 100% feedback, 10+ ratings and only accept bids from users in your own country. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 18:13:10
Very cool, Intact 1-BTC coins go for a premium. Best of luck :)
@_date: 2014-12-27 04:57:20
I hope they sell well. 2014 has been a slow year for Casascius.
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:11:11
Very good news Indeed!
@_date: 2014-09-02 01:57:51
Great work, always glad to see another coin website! :)
@_date: 2015-05-22 03:06:57
That sucks, sorry to hear about another attack. Best of luck with the analysis.
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:39:50
These are cool! A damn shame I missed the auction by a few days. Will you be making any more?
@_date: 2016-06-13 03:02:47
On the obverse of some casascius coins, it is written in binary: "You asked for change, I gave you coins".
@_date: 2016-06-13 03:07:19
Do not clean them up. Instead, place them into an air-tight to prevent further tarnishing. 
BitcoinTalk or any forum in general is always a risk and with Casascius coins it is always best to use escrow. eBay is another choice but be careful how you word your listing as ebay can take it down if "bitcoin" is in the title. Also the ebay and paypal fees can be ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-01-05 04:54:01
Nice collection coblee! 
@_date: 2017-01-06 01:28:37
Thanks for the heads up, I'll check my list to see what I'm missing. :)

Very cool, best of luck! 
@_date: 2015-07-16 03:02:30
Great Idea!
@_date: 2015-09-10 19:21:11
I have one of the rare (possibly rarest) unfunded "broken" coins that Casascius sold in 2011. It is one that he felt looked bad due to the center paper disc upside down and crooked. I might be willing to sell it for the right price. 
I also have an intact 0.1 BTC 2013 Silver coin. Link: 
@_date: 2015-04-16 01:38:07
I know them quite well. You can even sell the redeemed coins for a decent price. Last I've seen was about $80.
@_date: 2015-03-15 22:06:27
Back when the 10 BTC silver coins first came out, I had the hard choice of either buying one or putting an Ad in the first edition of Bitcoin Magazine. I try to tell myself that I made the best decision, but if I could do it again, I would've rather bought one. Best of luck with the sale of this beautiful coin!
I like your desk mat. What is that a map of?
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:08:50
Check out the ones on ebay for a general idea of what they are going for.
@_date: 2016-07-12 04:10:02
Very cool, I may just buy one. 
Thank you!
