so I guess you think our financial system is running just fine huh? When this country is in financial ruins people are gonna say....no one ever saw it coming. Who would have thought the government(s) were so corrupt. And the nut jobs will try so hard not to say we told you so....but that's none of my business.

@_date: 2014-07-26 20:21:06
thanks buddy!
@_date: 2014-03-26 17:39:33
Maybe you should calm down there Hitler. You feeling ok? There appears to be a lot of anger in you not sure what your problem is but anyways I didn't ask for anyone's advice and I didn't blame anyone for my situation either so go take your hostile condescending ass somewhere else. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 00:28:43
Where are you located? I'm curious / interested. send me a pm.
@_date: 2014-03-26 15:19:07
well I'll have to find a way around it. The government does more harm to me than good.
@_date: 2014-01-18 19:37:07
you mean bitcoin apps that simply display the price. doesn't really do much for me but I do hope some day apple just backs off or I will have to switch to an android phone.

4 out of 5 people would never consider having premarital sex. This is meaningless.
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:42:53
even if they did I would still own them.

SELL...ALL THE DOLLARS!
@_date: 2014-05-15 04:47:53
I'm cautious of Glenn Beck, I'm surprised he is interested in Bitcoin but I am very cautious of him. It looks like he has changed his political position but is he really a libertarian now? We shall see.
@_date: 2014-06-07 19:43:55
you're not looking hard enough. 
@_date: 2014-05-28 04:17:12
not impressed.
@_date: 2014-07-28 20:44:37
THAT WORKED! Thank you!
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:41:28
I propose we ban the U.S. dollar. U.S. dollar is used to fund Israel's massacre in Gaza and also used to fund and train the ISIS group running wild.
@_date: 2014-05-11 03:29:47
make it rain!
@_date: 2014-05-11 02:27:34
thanks dude!
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:53:42
LMAO. good catch.
@_date: 2014-05-08 02:39:51
Don't worry, they can't force you to pay anything for your bitcoins. 
They don't have the resources or capability to stop bitcoin for it's intended use.
This is simply a scare tactic from the empire. Fuck the system.
@_date: 2014-07-19 16:10:07
I don't know why you assumed it was for free but I agree with you.
@_date: 2014-06-26 20:51:51
I'm open to rewording it if you have a better way to communicate the problem with fiat currency. I would appreciate it if you tone down your condescending attitude. I'll ask if I need it thanks.
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:16:36
I can see the media already associating nazis with bitcoin. Prepare for sabotage by mainstream media.
@_date: 2014-03-26 15:47:30
thank god for poverty right? who wants to live a better life? Am I right, am I right?
@_date: 2014-07-14 19:15:40
o wow I didn't catch that. thanks, I will correct it now.
@_date: 2014-04-24 23:57:20
it empowers people and gives them a currency that can't be manipulated by anyone for their own benefit.
@_date: 2014-05-20 04:04:52
NICE! :)
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:56:05
love it.
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:58:01
when did it come back? i just noticed now.
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:06:44
Well said. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 22:15:41
ok I'll take that. I do think this won't be an issue in 5 years or so. Just a hunch. 
I'm certain the masses will adopt it in time.
@_date: 2014-05-08 23:21:49
 I have a bachelor's in graphic design. I worked as a graphic designer at a small firm while I was pursuing my degree and eventually had to learn web design on the job. I've taken web design courses but  they were not accurate or teaching best practices. Usually because the instructor wasn't in the industry for that long.
The way you're doing it is right. That is how I sharpened my skills. To be completely honest with you, it's a tough industry. 
You'll most likely work for companies and firms that want to combine the work of three people into one person. I have worked for many companies and they all had this in common.
Currently I am freelancing. Working for myself is much more rewarding than under a company but it's still a tough job, especially with the economy. If it's your passion go for it. I wouldn't waste your time going to school for it. There is so many resources online and in the end... who ever you work for won't care you have a degree or not. they just want to see your portfolio.
I love web design. I love designing and coding it. It's fun but the job market is tough and it's one of the reasons why I'm trying to start my own business completely unrelated to web design. 
I hope I didn't burst your bubble but I want to be completely honest with you. Hope that helps.
@_date: 2014-05-20 07:19:33
i totally agree. i just want to raise hell for this. if i had a bitcoin in that wallet they would have effectively denied me my right to access my own finances. it's personal. we can't have none of that.
@_date: 2014-07-03 13:26:47
@_date: 2014-06-09 23:46:31
NICE! :)
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:22:13
I wish I could get coding. 
I'm a web designer, I get the basics such as variables, functions, and classes but then I always get lost when it comes to actually making something.
I admire those that can code and modify someone else's code. So jealous.
@_date: 2014-07-10 23:58:21
bitpagos I believe.
@_date: 2014-03-27 06:57:34
Neither do I. I claim myself a sovereign citizen and these rules do not apply to me. 
@_date: 2014-05-21 17:03:38
I can't tell if they're serious or just fucking around. It's just too ridiculous. I couldn't finish the video.
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:05:11
excellent. just created a wallet.
@_date: 2014-07-10 00:57:14
does coinbase want to lose customers? because that's how you lose customers.
@_date: 2014-08-02 02:53:07
@_date: 2014-06-07 17:46:29
great idea but I think there are already 2 social media sites that are decentralized. google and you will see.
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:06:07
Obligations to society? You mean obligations to corrupt politicians and their system of theft.
@_date: 2014-05-26 04:50:33
I'm also very curious. Is it even safe to store your bitcoins with? What if apple tries to block this app to with a change in terms of some kind?
@_date: 2014-08-17 00:05:18
o so it's only darkwallet to darkwallet? Oh that's disappointing. :/ 
@_date: 2014-05-10 18:29:49
thanks buddy!
@_date: 2014-07-14 17:17:22
Here is another one I made. Front &amp; Back.
Quick preview. actual size available.
@_date: 2014-07-14 06:22:41
Here is my design. Front &amp; back.
this is a quick preview. Actual size is available.
@_date: 2014-05-22 19:45:20
Ok so he's selling his stash ...effectively killing ripple. Is that too far a stretch? 
I'm curious to know why he decided to do so. Very interesting turn of events.
@_date: 2014-03-26 15:23:29
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:31:41
They do...they can lobby this silly policy. Bitcoin companies can work together and change this. At least that's what I believe they can do.
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:10:09
I appreciate an economic lesson how hyperinflation benefits those in debt. if you will.
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:18:13
using bitcoin to avoid theft.
@_date: 2014-05-09 22:28:02
oh ok.
@_date: 2014-08-02 20:02:31
The introduction and breakdown of reddcoin is an impressive. Just this video alone makes bitcoins intro look silly.
Well the bitcoin intro video is silly and I don't understand why they went with that look and feel for the video.
I want to download reddcoin on this presentation alone. Very well done.
@_date: 2014-07-30 12:30:42
lol...I enjoyed that.
@_date: 2014-06-26 19:59:25
it's a pdf but for some reason imgur displays as png.
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:35:14
so from what I am understanding someone does control bitcoin? It's a group of people who are in complete control of bitcoin's functionality. Is that what I'm understanding?
@_date: 2014-06-26 19:45:31
lol. thanks. Let me know if there are any other question I should address.
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:57:25
good I'm glad! I'm worried about these companies restricting our freedoms in terms of what software we can use.
@_date: 2014-07-26 16:27:57
LMAO! I wish I had bits to send you.
@_date: 2014-06-05 06:04:25
REAL NICE. I too do not owe anything. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 16:51:53
@_date: 2014-06-25 23:40:27
BUGGY. IT'S BUGGY. FOR THE GREENADDRESS DEVS PLEASE MAKE SOME UPDATES.
@_date: 2014-08-30 23:18:49
So excited!
@_date: 2014-06-20 00:17:59
agreed. I can finally say, there's an app for that.
@_date: 2014-06-03 04:24:38
that made me laugh.
@_date: 2014-05-25 16:45:33
@_date: 2014-06-03 00:57:23
not yet. :/
@_date: 2014-04-28 21:15:07
I AGREE!
@_date: 2014-06-29 16:39:38
interesting article
@_date: 2014-05-31 00:29:44
I also made efforts to start my own vape shop.
@_date: 2014-05-12 18:40:09
@_date: 2014-05-07 06:21:07
NICE! giving apple the big middle finger right now.
@_date: 2014-08-12 00:11:03
100% agree with you.
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:26:39
not sure I believe this or if I'm just over protective of bitcoin and useful bitcoin applications.
@_date: 2014-05-10 23:18:57
right on man.
@_date: 2014-05-08 02:29:49
thanks dude!
@_date: 2014-05-07 18:49:13
GOOD IDEA! I would pay to see that! Any idea which fighters we should sponsor?
@_date: 2014-07-15 20:49:08
just made another one today.
need to do the back side.
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:19:54
NO. HE. DIDN'T!
@_date: 2014-06-11 19:55:37
So can I just upload this to my existing website / server?
Do I need to do anything else?
@_date: 2014-05-09 08:02:35
thanks I appreciate that.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:54:13
Fuck! You got me good, I was like holy fuck this journalist isn't bullshitting. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:20:36
omg so much win in this reply. finally, someone who is awake!
@_date: 2014-07-16 16:24:34
and another one! :)
@_date: 2014-05-11 02:27:20
good point.
@_date: 2014-05-26 06:31:35
buy me one! ...lol.
@_date: 2014-06-05 14:47:24
good luck.
@_date: 2014-05-20 05:43:11
not yet but I'm livid right now. We can't have this. we need reliable wallets.
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:26:13
WE DON'T NEED A BITCOIN FOUNDATION!
@_date: 2014-08-10 05:28:37
another altcoin. what a surprise.
@_date: 2014-04-28 21:22:25
they don't want you to know how these corrupt politicians make a profit.
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:48:57
@_date: 2014-05-28 16:21:03
just ignore him.
@_date: 2014-06-02 20:34:30
Believe it when you see it. Until then your work is not in vein...come to think of it...it's not in vein if apple does allow bitcoin apps. more choices, more freedoms.
@_date: 2014-04-28 21:16:44
I was just thinking the same! lol.
@_date: 2014-05-11 16:01:15
can't tell if you're trolling but I accept the challenge.
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:14:52
luckily my wallet did not have any bitcoins but i'm unsure if the wallet it is displaying now is the same one i had before it disappeared?
did it just assign me a new one? 
can anyone confirm if their original wallet came back?
@_date: 2014-06-26 20:25:44
ok good point. I will see where I should include that. thanks!
@_date: 2014-07-04 02:15:27
suck it U.S Government!
@_date: 2014-05-11 17:42:38
The Bitcoin foundation needs to end. The sooner the better.
@_date: 2014-07-19 16:06:28
thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2014-06-26 20:23:49
no worries when it's finished I'll host the pdf on my site. Let me know if there is anything else I should include for noobies on bitcoin. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:25:45
yes it is, check your pants. It's clear you did not catch my sarcasm.
@_date: 2014-07-19 15:45:01
no uppercase? ok. I wouldn't say it's shouting though. What would you like to see? I'm looking to design more so if there is something you would like to have done let me know.
@_date: 2014-07-20 00:57:10
ok I understand, thanks for the feedback.
@_date: 2014-07-27 18:47:32
your email is not working for some reason.
@_date: 2014-05-13 16:19:32
I agree.
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:22:13
thank you for your contribution. :)
@_date: 2014-08-04 02:48:48
I hope he is found innocent.

Anarchy at it's finest.
@_date: 2014-05-10 21:17:33
awww low blow. lol. Well if you need any graphix work I would like to prove you wrong.
@_date: 2014-05-10 23:44:08
blood is boiling right now. the government can say whatever they like about bitcoin but they will not stop me from using it. 
We need to wake up and realize we are not free. We need to regain freedom in this country.
@_date: 2014-07-17 03:20:04
honey badger doesn't care.
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:37:15
the same way I did, media exposure, reddit, facebook, twitter, youtube. It wasn't the bitcoin foundation that brought this to my attention it was regular users like you and I.
@_date: 2014-05-09 18:19:46
SWEET! I hope she actually uses bitcoin but that's a great way to promote it. We need some models for bitcoin. ;)
@_date: 2014-05-13 16:02:52
I'm big a fan of Adam Kokesh. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 20:20:33
I completely agree, these companies are so eager to be apart of the crypto scene they name their companies similar to it. 
It's lazy and unimaginative. Have the balls to name your company something original for the sake of standing out.
I respect circle for not adding coin. They want to earn their name recognition without cutting corners.
@_date: 2014-05-03 15:44:40
good point.
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:12:07
I'm so glad for that. I'm in the same boat as you buddy. We can ride the bitcoin wave. :)
@_date: 2014-05-21 22:48:02
absolutely nothing! 
It is ridiculous that a spouse already wants a certain percentage of your bitcoin stash for a possible divorce down the road.
If she was committed to you she wouldn't have to worry about getting half of anything but it appears there are more and more incentives for a woman to divorce her husband than to actually work things out in our society.
What's to stop her from waking up one day and leaving your ass for alimony and all your hard earned money?
There is no reason a woman can't go find a job and support herself after a divorce. The benefits of being married is the support of two incomes.
The whole concept of the man supporting his ex wife through government force is outrageous!
@_date: 2014-07-17 03:13:23
I haven't made the jpeg yet.
@_date: 2014-01-18 06:51:38
you obviously don't realize apple is anti-bitcoin. They won't allow it. Several bitcoin apps have been blocked. Did you not get the memo?
@_date: 2014-07-22 17:28:14
I have it but I don't know anyone to use it with. :/
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:10:51
doesn't make a difference, still leaving apple when I get the chance. 
Suck it apple!
@_date: 2014-06-19 23:36:48
@_date: 2014-05-08 01:54:10
lol! nice one. I'd send you bitcoins if I had any.
@_date: 2014-07-05 04:18:02
of course

@_date: 2014-03-17 23:57:44
Maybe once she reaches puberty she will realize what a total bitch she was for exploiting a man for having the name as Satoshi Nakamoto. 
A fake name the creator decided to go by to...wait for it. Hide his identity. Such journalism, very idiotic.
@_date: 2014-07-19 18:21:31
I agree there are people who take it to the extreme and that's true when it comes to anything. I do believe there are some very power organizations and political figures working together for more power. I think it would be silly to think there aren't people pulling strings.
@_date: 2014-06-03 00:56:27
no, not just like that. Stay cautious.
@_date: 2014-08-06 16:55:04
you can use coinpocket. It works with your browser to send and receive. It's on the app store too.
