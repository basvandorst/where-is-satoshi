ha I was just making the same point. He never makes it to 19K because Bitcoin drops 11% he sells and then it goes up 30%.

Not really my Trezor arrived in two days from the czech republic to chicago. Never seem an ebayer ship that quickly. Someone trying to save a buck likely not worth it when your gonna be storing large amounts of money
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:25:26
I'd have to look at the charts but it's possible you wouldn't have made it to 19k. Bitcoin pulls back 11% then goes up 30% and you miss out on the 30% gain because you sold at teh 11% dip. No?

UI is the easy part. Money transmitter licenses is the hard part
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:18:48
The biggest reason is licensing. Every state requires a money transmitter or msb license. Very expensive and very slow. Some states like hawaii coinbase cant even get into yet and new york seems to have very strict laws i believe only one or a few exchanges are allowed to operate there. Must have a million liquid large bonds or insurance etc. Only a larger well funded company can even try to compete hemce why coinbase has zero competition for the most part currently
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:44:48
This is like saying coinbase got hacked so bitcoin isnt secure

I'm a little confused by the sentiment of your post. If you had to sum your point up in 1 sentence what is it?
You FOMO'd hard on Bitcoin Cash and made a stupid move. This is something you did not something bad about crypto, also Coinbase CEO is more for BCash than Bitcoin and in a way manipulated the market or at least tried to. I woudl say that's bad for crypto having too much power in one exchanges hands. 
You criticize the community for not adopting Bitcoin themselves, and then in the next breath criticize people who try to do what they can with what they have which is accepting crypto on their "cheesy website selling knits".  
In terms of what the news says who cares, I wouldn't say the more Bitcoins can be created is that widespread, if anything they are referring to forks creating more Bitcoins although as we know forks aren't Bitcoin. 
Cryptos biggest problems IMHO are...
1. Bitcoin is unusable as a currency and is just a store of value. IMHO the price for something like that is about 10K, not 50k, not 100k, etc. 
2. Exchanges are way too centralized and have way too much power. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:50:35

You shouldn't value yourself based on what women think of you. A guy who is of value to women is typically viewed that way because they have a positive life and things going on in their life and aren't dependent on a womens approval which is why women chase those guys. 
Also earning money through starting a business or some feat imho is much more impressive than buying something. Not saying you got lucky it's very cool and somewhat of a feat you stay on top of technologies to be aware of Bitcoin and being patient/disciplined enough to hold it is cool but to me it's not as impressive as someone starting a company or actually doing something. 
There's people who on a whim threw $100 into Bitcoin based on a friends recommendation 6 or 7 years ago. Those people were kind of lucky to have a friend in the space but I wouldn't say they are People magazines person of the year for accomplishment

I think I caused confusion by mentioning the affiliate thing, it's kind of irrelevant. I only have $50 in my segwit address which is money I've received from promoting ledgers. 
The main issue is my fee preview when I act as if I'm going to send is the same from my legacy account as it is from my segwit account which starts with a 3 which I checked to confirm it was segwit.
The affiliate payout has really nothing to do with teh story I'm not concerned about fees with money I'm receiving. When I attempt to send $50 from my trezor I'm getting the same fee preview from legacy as I am from segwit.

I still don't understand how a market not settled in BTC can affect the real BTC markets???
Is it just because BTC holders see what's going on in the futures market and react to it by selling? The futures market adds nothing in terms of volume to real Bitcoin markets and from my understanding nobody is holding any Bitcoin to back the futures so it would seem to me like two completely seperate markets?

It specifically says 20k in buys sells and transfers. I agree they should really only be concerened with sales but transfers were mentioned in the documents. This means if I buy 5k worth of btc, move it to trezor, that brings the tally up to 10k, then I move it back on to Coinbase thats 15k, then I sell it 20K. I'm not reportable and I've made one buy and one sell and transferred off to a hardware wallet like a good bitcoiner. That doesn't mean I owe tax, however it will be reported and I'll need to report my trades to show only the gain/loss on the sale

I agree the government does nothing efficiently but that said we need a government.  Also why make Bitcoin politically divisive.

Can you ELI5. Someone trading fake paper Bitcoin wants real Bitcoin to move the way they are betting it will. How does them wanting it to move have any effect on the price. 
I'm terrible with analogies but let's say were talking baseball cards. People want the new  Lazonzo Ball card and are willing to pay $100 for the card. . A futures market is created and drives the price down to $50. There are still people out there willing to pay $100 for the card, what do they care about the paper traders wanting to drive the price down to $50?

I get the idea of shorting, my question is how does a futures market that doesn't deal with "real" BTC or settle in BTC have any affect on teh actual Bitcoins price? 
In my mind that's like saying in regards to sportsbetting, if more people bet on the Cowboys over the Bears, the Cowboys will win, the sportsbetting market has 0 to do with the actual game going on, on the field. At least from my understanding the futrures market settles in USD and doesn't actually buy or settle in any Bitcoin so how does that have any value on Bitcoin price? 
Could the futures price be completely different than the price of Bitcoin?

Hey Jim, sorry I think I confused things mentioning affiliate, that has nothing to do with the story, that just happens to be where I got the $50 thats in my segwit wallet. Majority of my funds are in legacy. Just for shits and giggles wanted to see how much cheaper segwit transactions were so attempting to send $50 from my large legacy account, got a fee of about $15, attempted to do the same from segwit saw the same fee preview of $15

Hey Nimble, so I have a legacy account and I have a segwit address, I checked to make sure it shows a 3 at the start of the address. The affiliate program is irrelevant so sorry if that caused confusion, my point was most of my money is in my legacy address, I happen to have started using a segwit address to receive affiliate payouts so it's accumulated to the point of having $50 worht of bitcoin. I started acting like I was going to send from legacy and fee was $15 or there abouts, checked from my segwit address which has $50 in it and fee preview was also showing $15. i never actually hit send

@_date: 2017-12-07 04:05:48
I'm a holder myself but this Reddit forum is cultishly hold. With investments it's normal to take profits along the way, to rebalance ie if Bitcoin makes up a huge percent of your portfolio to diversify into other assets, maybe other assets that are down. 
Again, I'm a holder myself but the idea that only holding is right for everyone is silly. It's very hard to time the market, however lately with some play money I have been selling on peaks and buying on pullbacks accumulating more Bitcoin, wouldn't advise it but getting lucky and can kind of read the trends.
People should really do what they want and what's right for them

There's research to point to both sides, however I think mentally DCA is comforting to people as all their moeny doesn't go in and then go down if the market goes down and psychologically speaking that may prevent people from panic selling which is a good thing.

Florida has pretty loose money transmitter laws so your state is better than most. South Carolina is I believe the only state with no money transmission laws so that would be the ideal place. You would still need to register with Fincen but that's easy, the state is what would be the sticking point as typically fees are incredibly expensive and licensing process can be rough. I believe in Texas you need a liquid million to even apply.

You'd have to be a complete idiot with no money management skills to "burnt through 10 Million quickly"
Obviously not nearly on the scale of 10 Million but in the past couple years my income has increased about 5x, I really don't live any differently than I did before and I was making very little before. 
It's fairly easy to me as I'm not really into stuff ie clothes or cars, but of course we all like nicer things. I may grab a few more meals out, I may grab a soda or a beer at a restaurant where as before I may opt for water but outside of that my life is really no different.

I personally wish I had pulled 100% out of crypto back in December and gone into stocks, would be sitting a lot nicer right now

I'm no fan of taxes, but I feel like your exaggerating or your extremely rich because the highest tax bracket I believe is 37% or there abouts for a single person making over 470k or something along those lines. 
I hate taxes as much as the next guy, I think government is too big, etc but being realistic, if everyone of the 325 million people in the USA had a say in how their tax Dollars are spent it would be a huge shitshow. You want your tax dollars spent on abotion, I don't, Tammy wants her tax Dollars spent on roads, bill doesn't drive so he says fuck that shit, it's just really not feasible.

My point is 3% isn't enough for people to care. Okay I pay you in crypto, you give me 3% off, it's not enough for most people to care about. 
I recently got my crawl space redone, they offered me a 1.5% cash discount whcih equated to about $150 as it was a larger purchase. I still put it on my card because A. I didn't have to run to the bank, B. my chase card gives me a free 1 year warranty on their work and C. If they didn't come back and finish the last little bit I could call my credit card company.

The sun has been comming up every morning for thousands of years, crypto has been around for 10 years, and on top of that you have dozens of world governments involved, millions of people, thousands of coins. You may feel confident in the future of crypto but at the end of the day your investing in something you have 0 control over. There is nothing you can do to make Bitcoin worth more. You have no control over world governments, rumors that happen and affect price, large volume traders who manipulate markets. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 21:12:48
Its not grumpy, Reddit hates spam, learn that if your gonna be a marketer. You can promote stuff if you do in a more subtle way but you weren't very subtle.

@_date: 2018-08-22 22:19:20
Crypto isn't done but I don't think we'll see the hype we saw in late 2017 for a long time if ever again. 
Crypto definitely has some use cases. Black markets and illegal goods, huge use case. Heck even "high risk" legal indusries where its nearly impossible to get credit card processing, makes a lot of sense but for your average consumer crypto isn't substantially cheaper than credit cards to lure someone into using it. Crypto lacks some of the chargeback protection, does't give points and isn't as easy to use so at least at this time aside from the novelty of using it there is zero reaosn for a normie to use crypto. 
Even as someone who's been pretty involved in crypto since 2013, all my crypto purchases have been basically just for the novelty of using crypto, it's not more convenient by any means. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 11:33:32
Because its way better than steemit
@_date: 2018-08-22 22:26:09
No chargeback is by design, but its not attractive to buyers, buyers like that they can charge things back, merchants do not. I'm both a buyer and a merchant so I understand both sides. 
As far as illegal goods I didn't say that as a criticism, I think darkweb sites when they came out were genius. Illegal goods or not hte fact that a middleman can't get in the way of someoen who has something to sell and someone who's loooking to buy something is a plus, I wans't saying that as a criticism. 
As far as transferring large sums over large distances, I agree with you there, the banking system is expensive, slow, stupid and archaic, keep in mind though what you like is the fact you can avoid KYC and AML policies. I think that's a positive as those laws are unnecessary invasive and stupid but realize your essentially saying violating the law is a use case. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 00:46:15
I would be interested in percentage wise which is used more for illicit activity. Obviously way more people use Dollars than Bitcoin so it would make sense it's used more for crime. 
I have a feeling percentage wise Bitcoin has been used more for illicit activities because lets be honest Bitcoin grew because of darknet markets. 
That's not a criticism of Bitcoin, any tool can be used for bad, some terrorists run people down with cars, doesn't mean we should ban cars. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 20:14:24

@_date: 2018-08-22 22:22:48
Credit card fees are about 3% tops. Bitcoin involves a fee to buy for a lot of people and thenanother fee to send so your not even saving 3%. If a merchant tells me hey I'll save you 1% if you pay me in crypto, 1% doesn't get my dick hard, I'm not gonna change my behavior or use crypto to save 1%. I also potentially get 1% back on my credit card in rewards points and have chargeback protection and a free 1 year warranty on everything I buy. Crypto is more complicated to use and doesn't give me any of that. 
Also merchants are the ones who eat processing fees so it doesn't affect me one way or the other as a buyer. 
High risk industries is where the use case comes in. I'm a high risk merchant, I pay 7% for processing, in some industries i"ve been involved with before I've paid 14% because nobody else would give me processing. That is where crypto makes sense. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 16:12:25
Yeah totally agree with you there. I think that's partly because people have become more educated on the fact that Bitcoin is not anonymous. People have seen most darkweb markets go down so are less likely to trust them. There also aren't really any good options right now. Andof course crypto has seen a lot more adoption so most of the new people flooding in are buying and investing not buying weed.

Prices must have come down. Back when I was looking buying direct was $30 or $40 cheaper. Either way I was only willing to buy from satoshi labs who makes the Trezor so I was either buying from their site or from them direct on Amazon, I wasn't willing to buy from a third party

People have complaints about Gemini and Kracken as well, people are always going to complain. Coinbase is I believe the largest exchange and the most common one to use, especailly for USA customers and especially noobs so makes sense they will have the most complaints.
I like COinbase, they've been good to me, it's easy and convenient and despite this whole fork thing who cares if they chose not to support the coin they gave us plenty of time to move our Bitcoin. 
I see no reason not to use them although that said I don't store my Bitcoin on their site I buy it and move it to my Trezor or Bittrex if I wana trade

Okay so I'll be the first to say I think the hype about keeping your coins off exchanges is overblown. I think some people are more likley to lose or mishandle their Bitcoins on their own and I think that's a bigger risk than something happening with Coinbase. When people talk about don't leave your coins on an exchange I think they are generally thinking about exchanges back in the day which weren't nearly as secure as Coinbase.
That said there's a reason you moved them off Coinbase right? That may happen again in November. Also what if the SEC decides Bitcoin or cryptos are securities and shutdown Coinbase, probably not likely but just saying.
Buy yourself a [Trezor]( it's one of the most secure ways to store your coins, they are letting you keep your Bitcoin Cash and i'ts super easy to use even for a beginner.

Crypto isnt as cheap or easy or ingrained as debit cards or cash so it will take a lot. I run a "high risk" business for merchant processors.

Yeah I definitely think it's a cool idea to implement crypto into the site and I think it's great to expose new people to crypto. My gf who has no interest in Bitcoin was kind of excited for me yesterday when she saw this hat store she likes accepted it so I told her if she setup a wallet I'd send her money and pay for her hat as it was my only way to get her interested lol.
I guess my main point is in the same way I see people stretching to find any product to sell on FBA because they hear all these stories of FBA riches I see a lot of people kind of jumping into ecommerce and accepting crypto thinking everyone on the LItecoin Reddit forum will support them just for accepting Litecoin which I do think there's some truth to that but not a good strategy to rely on. 
I guess my question to you is what is your store all about? Who's your target customer? What kind of stuff are they into? What is the reason they would buy from you? What's the image of your site?

Anytime we hit a new all time high or a nice round number like 5k or 10k I think it can go one of two ways.
First is FOMO kicks in and people who had been sitting on the sidelines want to get in. People who didn't really take Bitcoin seriously at 3k, 5k, 7k, etc are finally ready to take it seriously and buy in at 10k, and people get excited and buy in and drive the price up so things continue running.
The  second thing that could happen is people start taking profits which causes a slide which causes more people to want to take profits before the price receeds.
I'ts an interesting time for Bitcoin with the whole CME thing going, to a lesser extend the Big Bang Theory episode comming later this week, year end which some people may want to take some gains or close out some positions for tax purposes, etc. 
I'm a holder but I think at 10K I may sell a coin and some change, that should give me back most if not all of my initial investment so I'm back even and I still have a decent amount of coin and would let the rest ride. 
I think a pullback to say $8600 would be healthy and to some extent is almost expected. I think it  will continue to run higher but I'm sitting pretty heavy right now so when dips happen I'm not really comfortable buying as I'm already in pretty heavy so by liquidating a little bit on the next dip if one happens I'll be prepared to jump in heavy
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:29:25

The concept is the same "speculating" moreso than investing. That said it's the same concept buying low and hoping to sell high.
I agree Bitcoin has more potential future value than the Iraqi Dinar but I doubt Bitcoin will ever see the $1200 range, at least not anytime in the next couple years.
I try to swing trade bitcoin from time to time, i'll buy at $200 and sell at $280 and wait for it to come down and do it again.
Bitcoin does have some problems such as transactions taking too long to be confirmed for small purchases like Coffee, etc. I'm not gonna wait 5 or 10 minutes for a transaction to post to get my coffee, however with other ecommerce type transactions I think Bitcoins are great. 
I do see value in Bitcoin but honestly don't bother debating it with people, people either get it or they don't. I have so many people telling me it's fake money, you can't hold it. That's a stupid argument, how many people deal with cash these days almost all money is digital. 
Bitcoin has value, it's anonymous, it can't be controlled as there's no central authority, etc. That said people get it or they don't. People who get it see the value and love it, people who don't won't use it until it's completely mainstream and everyone else is using it.

Think about the dead people washing up in Myanamar, think about your wife or child or mom or dad getting killed in a car wreck, etc. It's morbid to say but that is bad stuff. So a little money was lost, Bitcoin should bounce back and even if it doesn't you can make more money.

May as well go through Coinbase or Gemini there you actually own and hold your own Bitcoin and can transfer it to Electrum or your Trezor where as Robinhood its stuck on their platform can only buy and sell there, can't send it, and your trusting them to really have the Bitcoin they are supposedly selling you

Moneylaubdering kyc etc. These companies have to follow these rules. If you use a fake name eventually youll likely be locked out of your account and have your money tied up. Alternative use shady chinese or russian exchanges that may run offf with your money. Coinbase has to follow al the same rules your bank, mortgage company, stock brokerage accounts etc do

Your logic isn't very strong. First off credit card is not a debt and costs me no interest if I pay it off at the end of the month. It's the convenience of not having to carry cash and the protection it provides. At this point in time crypto can't match that. 
Also, keep in mind crypto is asking people to change their habits and behaviors, if we expect people to do that there has to be an advantage to doing so otherwise why change right? Well merchant processors on the high end are 3%, considering there's a cost to buy bitcoin and send bitcoin your not even getting that full 3% so again where's the benefit to using crypto?
You kind of poo poo my darkmarket example but marijuana is legal in many states ie Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Colorado, yet credit card companies still won't process transactions so this is more a grey market than dark market example. That said that is the exact use case that crypto is good for. If I'm buying a phone case I don't really care about being beholden to a credit card company because there's no isue with buying phone cases. Its those grey market examples that credit cards wont get invovled with so maybe I'm buying weed or a sex doll or a gun or fireworks or hiring a call girl, that's the only scenario where not having a middleman is even needed.

At one point there was a year long waiting list but think about it, had you applied back then you'd be on by now. It's an amazing program,  all you do is upload designs and they handle everything else, you don't have to worry about payment processors, returns, etc and honestly the margins aren't much worse than printful or whatever your doing but its a heck of a lot less work. Also Amazon has mllions of people shopping their site everday where as your here on Reddit trying to drive traffic from r/cryptocurrency where as Amazon would send you that traffic automatically.
Back during last year I was selling about 15 crypto shirts per day, at their normal base price that's about $80 per day without having to lift a finger. Seriously man go signup right now

I'll tell you something that hurts adoption. I bought two winter hats from Beardo. 3 weeks went by I received nothing. I finally called up, despite accepting Bitcoin they didn't know how it worked, how to accept it or how to process payments so they didn't even know they had an order from me. It's experiences like this that on the rare occasion you get someone to new to use Bitcoin they won't be using it again. Add to that the hats I paid $40 for a couple weeks later I essentially paid something like $200 for if I had still owned the Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 19:34:16
Okay let's say debit card your using your own cash. Also anyone who's not an idiot pays their credit card off before the end of the month. Take advantage of the convenience, rewards and protection and free warranties and never give them a penny. You can suck Bitcoins dick all you want but if you look at the numbers adoption is not happening among the mainstream let alone crypto supporters. We had more adoption 3 or 4 years ago in terms of people actually using crypto for purchases, we've gone backywards.

Yes however Overstock has been taking Bitcoin for years, for much of that time keeping 90% of the funds in Bitcoin and only converting 10%, they did this through the huge steep rise in BTC price, so even if AMazon started today they would need Bitcoin to go to like 10K or more to match what Overstock did.
Also overstock is now working with shape shift to accept over 35 maybe even 40 different altcoins so they are doing more than just Bitcoin and while I'm not clear on the details I think overstock may even be starting an exchange.

I'm a Bitcoin supporter but honestly my dude, explain to me how Bitcoin is superior to credit cards at Costco?
The value fluctautes too much, clearing time is too slow, and its arguable whether its cheaper than credit cards, even if it is cheaper than credit cards which I doubt 1% or 2% isn't enough to sway the average person to use it.
To me Bitcoin is never gonna be a mainstream way to pay for stuff. Maybe for unique industries, high risk processors who can't get merchant processing but even as a crypto supporter I'm probably gonna use my Visa at Costco instead of Bitcoin

I know not everyone thinks like me but Bitcoin has 0 appeal to me to use on Amazon. It does have use. I have suppliers in Africa I have to send Western Union to which is expensive and inconveneint so there tons of value for me. For payments between friends or sending family money it even appeals to me but for Amazon really has no appeal. I think noobs are goign to be getting into to speculate not to buy, if someone is from the states and has a bunch of debit cards, credit cards, bank transfer options as well as Payapl there's just not really a need for it to buy pizza or a phone charger off Amazon. I realize not all people think like I do but many do. Also the savings from credit cards isn't really substantial enough to tip someone in that directoin IMHO

I'm with you, I'd love to get back to 20k and it does seem like we have some positive momentum and momentum is powerful. Crypto can move very fast so I wouldn't put 50k out of of the possibility this year but I also wouldn't put 5k out of possibility

I'm not super knowledgeable about Arizona money transmitter laws but it's not as simple as paying $1500 and here's your license. 
You need a bond which will run a few grand per year if you can even find a company to write one. Typically your not allowed to work out of your house so need to rent an office space. Typically you need to show a couple hundred grand liquid, in some states like Texas a million liquid, plus ongoing reporting requirements and all for something which the government doesn't even deem a currency.
It's not as simple as walk down to the county court house pay $1500 and your good to go.

Unless your a huge company to the point where the money you bring may entice the bank to take on the added compliance risks your better off just flipping your own Bitcoin ie whatever you make in profits you want to take you you'll need to sell via LocalBitcoin, Craigslist, OfferUP. I know not an idea way to run a business but the most likely way you'll actually make this work. 
Either that or find banking in like Belize but that brings on it's own challenges.

I'm waiting over 12 hours on a Coinbase transfer so minutes isn't exactly true

I would say 100% gain because you have no buy to offset it

I think either right off the bat or within a month BCC is gonna fall and then rise again. If the price is high enough I may dump and buy back in with some of the profits when it drops. 
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:06:55
Haha thanks brother appreciate it ��
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:22:52
That's assuming that Coinbase isn't so backlogged with transfers that your not able to get a transfer out on the 31st

If I could predict bitcoin prices I wouldnt work and would just fuck around on reddit all day

I saw that message this morning. What does that mean exactly? Basically don't send Bitcoins to Bittrex?
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:15:39
If bitcoin cash is 100 and you get 10 i would think your tax obligation is $1000. I have no idea for real but that would be my guess

Still tho a million at 40k per year gets you 25 years  and still leaves you with a mill at 55. All these stories of how little people have if 2illion isnt enough then 98% of people are fucked.

Dont use coinbase use coinbase pro. You paid a stupid tax blame yourself
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:11:38
Another question and I realize this may be hard to answer as I'm basically asking you to speculate on a future scenario but say Bitcoin splits. Will something like Trezor or Electrum prompt us on our first login after the split that we have 2 tokens or ask us to choose? Just trying to wrap my head around logistically speaking how I see I have two coins and how I manage the two.

Theres definitely people in the crypto world cheering at prices sinking and its dumb
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:26:59
Bitcoin doesnt make sense for normal transactions where I'm not concerned about privacy or things that aren't grey market. I'm an ecommerce seller in the high risk space meaning I cant get processing or it will cost me 2x or 3x normal rates. For me it makes sense. As far as buying a cup of coffee or a pair of socks credit card is easier faster gives me rewards and chargeback protection. If ots not 10x better people wont use it.
@_date: 2019-05-03 11:07:50
Dont blindly hold that's dumb

Love the idea but the lack of any activity on there is going to make it tough to bring people in. You may have to give people some free credits for a few free gigs or give some bitcoins for joining. 
This is the challenge with any new community based site be it a dating site, freelance site, etc. Its kind of a catch 22. You need people on the site but you can't bring people until you have people. While it doesn't provide a great user experience many dating sites and even reddit itself used bots early on. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:21:50
I mean Fiverr isn't going to pay you in Bitcoins but you could very easily use that money to purchase Bitcoins or you could find your own clients outside of a third party service like Fiverr or UPwork and just request to be paid in Bitcoins.

Am I correct in assuming maybe for the first few days after a split it's dangerous to do anything but after a week or two or whenever we get the all clear if it did split into two coins at some point we would be safe to cash out the one we dont want?

A loss leader isnt offerimg napkins. A loss leader is selling milk at a loss by a supermsrket because getting milk brings you into the store and you also wind up buying cereal amd cheese which they are profitable selling to you. The milk is the loss leader that brings you in.

I get its funny haha, but if we want cryptos to be taken seriously let's cut the stuff about the US Dollar being gone in 5 years or the banks being gone in 6 months. They aren't going anywhere.
