This is definitely not worth paying money for. It's just a feed aggregator. How can you justify charging a subscription for this?
Also looks to be your alt - 1 year redittor but only 2 comments, close together, on your 2 posts of this site? That also makes me wonder if you have used other alts to upvote yourself

I mean - the easy solution is to buy 2 balls and place them on the left and right on a table. That makes them HIS/HER balls - and then eat the left one. Done. It doesn't even need to be testicles, it could be a rice ball - it was never specified in the OP.

This probably has framed it the best for me. And I do understand just how NEAR impossible it is. But I don't like the fact that it is out of my control. There is nothing else I can do to help make it more secure.
Yes, it may take 2^45 years to guess ALL combinations - BUT they don't need to go through every combination - they just need 1. Which COULD be in the first 10 tries. Yes the probability of this is nearly infinitesimally small, I know. But there's nothing any of us can do to prevent that happening.

You put it in a good perspective, but most of the time there are certain things within my control. For example, to access my bank account you need my ID, my password, and a 2 factor authentication. If somebody got my ID and password, and tried bruteforcing the 2 factor, then it locks the account out after a small number of tries. That gives me extra peace of mind that there is something in my control, and if that fails then the account gets locked.
While this isn't a 100% measure either, there is less random chance involved. To reactivate access to my account I need to go to a branch with my ID and proofs that only I should have. For someone to go through this entire process and fake the ID and know the passwords and all the above - it can't be guessed. The private key can just be guessed and there is nothing I can do about that.

What if one of my private keys happened to be one of the first they tried? Then it becomes a guarantee they will break it, and not an extremely unlikely chance. The chance of that happening, is still small, yes. But it is possible and I have no control over that. That's what worries me. I have no control over it.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:22:00
This I like. This is something more within my control that I can do to make it less likely.
How do you set up a multi-signature address? Armory?
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:53:32
But it's not entirely impossible. Really bad luck could have it that your private key is in one of the first tries.
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:52:57
That is a wrong statement - it COULD happen, and it MIGHT. If something CAN happen, then it MIGHT happen.
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:55:22
If it COULD happen, then it might.

Buy some or Seriously, use the search....

As I said above, I at least have some extra control over how secure my account is, and there is a failsafe. I do acknowledge that someone could try to impersonate me and get all those details, but I at least have a modicum of control over how secure those details are, as well as who has access to them. With the private keys, I have 0 control.

I wouldn't be "leaking" it per se - but I would ideally like to use it as a watch only address so I can keep an eye on the balance. So essentially, I can now just backup my seed (and address labels) from Electrum; encrypt and store them; get my MPK; remove my wallet and delete the files from my PC; and use the MPK to watch the balance? Am I right in that?
And no, I don't really know how the blockchain and mining works - that is my next port of call after I can sort out the practical and security side.

1. Don't listen to bl33bl00p, you do NOT want to trust ANYONE online with your money. There are several guides on here that explain how to create secure wallets. Search for them and study them. Make sure you understand 100%. Also look at 2. True, nobody knows this. Personally I don't think it's going to drop much more than it has just now.
3. Only you can decide this. Obviously buying at a cheaper price means a better ROI. But only you can decide what you SHOULD do.

It isn't impossible though. What if my private key, or one of them, happened to be in one of their first few attempts? It is possible.
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:47:01
But this doesn't actually stop them, just makes it highly improbable. My private key, or one of them anyway, could just as easily be in one of the early attempts.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:08:15
I'm not trolling. It's a genuine security concern - and if I'm concerned about it, you can guarantee other people are concerned about it. And it's what I think is one of the big downfalls of BitCoin for true global adoption. Some companies will just not go for that risk.
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:49:13
That's what I thought. And that's what worries me about the success of Bitcoin. Is that it's not completely impossible for someone to just guess their way into your wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:19:04
And that is part of the risk, that somebody could indeed make it within those 3 guesses. But they are limited to just 3. With BTC, there is no limit and they could easily run millions of guesses (this is a simple task).

Thanks for your reply! I really appreciate you taking the time out for it.
As for the fees, I'm still a little lost. In Electrum, for example, I can set a fee of 0 when sending, but is this a bad idea? Should I set a small fee so it is more likely to be accepted by miners?
So let me get this straight. If I have my Master Public Key, I can use this to view my balances, and I don't have to be over-protective of it? But my Seed (for deterministic) - I should keep under lock and key until I need to withdraw? Are there any other preventative measures I should take?
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:37:32
It's essentially a "finder's fee". If you lose money and someone returns that money to you, they are legally entitled to 3% of what they returned. You return €100 to someone, you are legally entitled to get €3 from them
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:16:32
Yes, but that chance becomes even smaller. I didn't say it was ideal, but it is something that I can do to help make it less likely.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:18:10
Is there really a need for this much security? Can't I just store my seed in a TrueCrypt container and stick that somewhere safe? I don't want to have a paper trail, because I will lose it. Having digital copies is much easier for me to keep track of, and I have faith that TrueCrypt can keep it secure.
