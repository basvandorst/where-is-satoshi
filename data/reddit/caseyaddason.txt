But don't they lock in the rate at the time that you buy it? So what's the difference?
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:25:08
Should be good to go! See if it works?
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:13:20
Oooh! Great ideas! Just fussing with the payment gateway trying to actually accept Bitcoin. I think for now, Bitcoin makes a better ‘value store’ than currency! : p fucking usd! �� Oh, and congrats!! Hopefully this is the tide that elevates all ships! Or something... ��

Hey doods! Casey here. 
Actually, I own and operate a print shop, as luck would have it. We're all hootin' and hollerin' about the good news, and I'm in the club! : p Earned my first full coin!! So I made some tees to celebrate. : p 
What do you think? I hate to self promote, but I thought you guys might like the designs? Let me know what you think, and if it's appropriate to post these, or if I'm being a cuck.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:42:34
Dawg!!  : p At least we're both thinkin'! I don't know how to market it here on reddit without coming off as spammy : /
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:12:45
Yeah, I mean it seems like the investment is into a new technology and economic infrastructure. Not short term USD gain. The mistake we're making is treating Bitcoin like a commodity to be bought and sold for the sake of USD gain. I just don't think that's what this is all about. IMO. Wouldn't it be nice if we're all stocking up on Bitcoin now, and in a few years us HODLers have tripled our investment, and Home Depot starts accepting Bitcoin! I'd never stop improving. Wait.. that's Lowes...

Spot on! Economy is a funny thing. Stuff is only worth what people are willing to pay for it, if they're even willing at all! Bitcoin is great, but at the moment you can hardly spend it! So where's the practical value? Well, it wasn't really there. Until super recently! In the local papers, trending on FaceBook. That's the kind of exposure that's needed to get it into the hands of the masses. Then it'll have actual value. As a small business owner, I very much look forward to the day when I can invoice and accept bitcoin. Or even live gigs, where we make the majority of sales in USD cash, which we then slip into our pockets. Tax free. Bitcoin would help a lot in these regards. I think it being at above $7k is still undervalued. As long as something doesn't undermine it! Like a fork, or gov't regulation...
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:09:28
Oh! So there's no sense in depositing USD, just buy with your checking, let it take a few days, and have the locked in rate at the time of buy in? That's what I've been doing. Bought in around the 6300 mark. Just a little confusing not seeing the purchases reflected in real time : / But at the rate it's growing, I can't complain about 1.5 percent!
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:47:37
Yoooo!!!! Thank you so much!! It really means alot to me. : ) Bitcoin integration needs some time, so I really need an alternative. I'll definitely check out Litecoin integration! Thank you again so much :) Help me spread the word if you think it's cool. I just really don't want to come of as just trying to sell something, but if they hear it from a customer, might make it work! &lt; 3
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:01:10
I'm really curious, myself! And I wonder if people are stocking up right now, which is inflating the price when perhaps the strategy should be: wait till the fork, which will double your worth, then BTC will drop, sell the fork and buy more BTC? I'm thinking that's what I'll do... Trying to avoid the temptation to buy a ton right now at about 7200 to increase my fork gains : /
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:59:49
Oh yeah!! I forgot about that! I just downloaded it and haven't had a chance to play with it. Good idea! : p
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:01:16
Gah! Hehe! Totally understand. And don't ignore in the above comment, I own a business. Bootstrapped it from nothing. Now it pays 4 salaries. Modest, but in Binghamton, NY that's quite a feat. And screen printing is becoming more and more automated. We still do things manually. Very competitive pricing. If anyone understands the value of a 2017 dollar, it's me. You don't have to tell me about money making the whirrled go 'round : p I just think it's a wonderful opportunity to level the financial playing field. In time, of course. Cause trust me. Get into employees. And taxes. And workers comp. And insurance. And working 6 and 7 day weeks. There's something that we're missing in the human experience. Money is needed, don't get me wrong, but we need some serious financial reconstruction. And work-life balance. The cost of doing business gets more and more expensive, while the value of a dollar becomes less and less. It's a rat-race, for sure. And it's an unsustainable race to the bottom. Fiat currency always crumbles. The USD is no exception. I very much look forward to the day when small business and vendors accept Bitcoin, and the customer base actually has it to spend from their smart phones! Might be right around the corner! : p

Ok! I have it on mucklesink.com I just have to add international shipping. Which country are you in?
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:54:57
And how does this work? Bit for fiat?
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:23:32
Taxation is legal theft! For the proletariat! : p tell me about it, bruh. Running a business is tough as nails. Especially in New York State. And I feel like a cuck trying to sling tees on reddit, but I mean, trying to put the ideals into practice ya know? I’m just using bitcoin as a savings account. HODL!! It’ll grow!! : )
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:56:19




Woot! Depends how many people are woke AF. Do working class folks care about Bitcoin when they're worried as it is about paying bills? I hope so... you'll know Bitcoin is a surefire bet when small business and working class heros are using it. Most people don't even think the current system is broken... do they? I think it's an ideological battle we've got here. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:50:08
I'm not sure Bitcoin is ready for such transactions. Maybe I'm just a nub with Wordpress. Any advice?
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:58:25
Yep. And those of us who have done some cursory research, well... it's no easier! Do we sell before the fork? Will there be a dip afterwards? Is it worth buying back into? Will we reach 20k someday? Is it about making a profit, or building a future for how 21st century economy works... : /
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:59:17
Woot! : p
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:26:37
Fucking brilliant, man! And you'll earn yourself a cut of the sales. Paid in Bitcoin of course : ) Let me mock that up now : p
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:38:51
Yes, dawg!! This is the sentiment we're battling. My GF is like, 'well, my parents might have some money they'd be happy to invest if they could see a phat return'... and I'm like, it's not really an investment with a USD return, I mean it CAN be, but it's really about supporting the future of globalized currency; evening out the playing field, which ultimately helps us all. Also you'd be stockpiling money into a currency that actually GROWS the wealth inside it, unlike savings accounts that yield almost nothing. This is a hard sell to our parent's generation. (I'm 31) It's like trying to explain the internet to our grandparents. : / It's just a new model. Anecdote: we have a small to mid sized screen printing business that we bootstrapped about 5 years ago. We're grossing a decent amount for our size, and my dad (also business partner) is like, 'where's all the profit? You guys are grossing a lot, and we're still making minimum wage!' Problem 1. Cash flow is a huge problem. Right now, we're about $20k out in outstanding invoices! Having to wait 30, 60, or 90 days to get paid is an absolute small-business killer. Not to mention the transaction fees. Not only that, it's tough to explain the value of a 2017 USD to someone that's in their 60's. We spend at least 10-15k in blank tee shirts a month! A roll of screen tape is $8! Everything is so flipping expensive these days! The value of USD is going straight down the tube, and small businesses like us are feeling it like whoa! : p I think when you see vendors and small enterprises accepting (eventually exclusively) Bitcoin, you'll know the true value of the currency. Anyhow, I think crypto is the future, and am so happy to see this Reddit community blowing up!

Although I'm not familiar enough with Wordpress to get the Stripe gateway to play nice with Bitcoin. Any ideas? : /
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:53:51
Ha! Yeah, I’m actually having trouble getting it to accept Bitcoin. I guess I’m not familiar enough with Wordpress and Stripe : /
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:06:45
Wahoo!!! This is a great piece of advertising. Real-world application of a new technology! Exciting times, regardless of what the property is actually worth : p
