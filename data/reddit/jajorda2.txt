WSD is an extremely right-wing "news" site. They'll also spam the hell out of your inbox if you sign up. But, I find some of it pretty entertaining. Pretty sure they were touting some Glen Beck stuff a few months ago. use at your own risk.

This phenomenon is called the paradox of choice. Here's a Wikipedia link for more info. Basically, increased choices lowers the rate of decision-making.

There is money that has been there for more than 60 days--simply because the deposit is from Coinbase, they said it was play money.

I think that's what we've decided--to go through our credit union for the loan. 100% LTV (loan-to-value), cheaper appraisal fee, lower interest rate, and I can put as much money down as I want from as many places as I want. Seriously, I hate the government a little bit right now.

So if I buy $400 worth of Bitcoin (let's assume that is one full Bitcoin) and the price of that Bitcoin goes to $300. I then spend that Bitcoin on towels or something. I haven't realized any gains, right? So there's nothing to report?

You can break open the slab (not so easy but possible with a hammer and a careful swing..no I'm not kidding and ive done it successfully). Just make sure you have a backup airtite capsule to toss it in. ANACS did not send mine back.

Bummer! Well cheers to you for doing your part!
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:39:44
I collect other non-bitcoin numismatic coins. Slabbing offers protection, verification , etc for high value coins. In most cases, a grade of 69 or 70 means your item can fetch higher prices because they have a verified quality. Heck, someone offered me this same series coin graded ms70 for 1BTC a few weeks ago and an MS69 he had on hand for .75. some dealers will sell an MS69 for as much as .90BTC. 
grading is a gamble though. You might get an ms66 or lower which could put your coin at .4 or something. I would say if they're handled, keep them that way. If they've been in the capsule forever, consider getting it graded. Only costs $44 (includes return shipping).
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:36:40
Trying to do this too on my Mac. Have 4gb ram allocated and a 200mb/s internet connection and it says it’s going to take 4 more days to sync(already been 4 days and nights non stop). 
Any ideas for me to speed it up at all? I’m getting .05% hourly increases.
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:44:22
Just to update you; got my grades back from ANACS. The Cas and the Lealana are both MS69!
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:18:59
Oh no worries! I had a 1BTC Silver Gilt Casascius until 2014 when I sold it for $1000.......
Should have kept it. Worth a ton now. I have an acquaintance who happens to have the 10BTC silver gilt version and he wants like 18BTC for it.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:13:34
Sold 17BTC in 2014 to buy hardwood flooring and some other upgrades to my newly purchased house. Would be worth a lot more now, but I love my floors so I don’t regret it. It was the right thing to do at the time.
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:05:23
Yep! I’ve sold him coins and things at various times over the last several years; done a few high dollar trades. He’s a great dude. I hope he manages to sell it or auction it off at Sotheby’s one day :) you’re right though it’s an amazing piece to own.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:42:29
Not sure if I'll sell yet and the price will likely depend on the grade if I do. If I do sell, I'll likely auction it on BitcoinTalk but I will certainly let you know :)
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:49:14
Bitcoin is a deflationary currency. If the supply decreases, the value increases. Since BTC is divisible to 8 decimals, we can use smaller amounts that will be worth more. One BTC now might be worth $500. One mBTC might be worth $500 in the future given price increases that might be partially due to lower supplies of full coins.
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:53:43
So, what is an api and how the heck did somebody hack it? Sounds like a huge vulnerability.

@_date: 2013-11-12 20:29:52
those are the biggest differences, if you're just looking for high-level info.
The number of possible coins is greater for Litecoin, it is mined using GPUs because ASICs are not compatible with scrypt.
Same concept, slight differences. Big price difference.

I purchased from titanbtc.com and have been incredibly impressed. I'm keeping it locked up. It's my novelty 1Btc but is transferrable to a wallet at any time. It's a throw back to wanting to hold my money. I'll never ever spend the damn thing.

Yes. Yes it is.
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:45:21
You should contact support immediately with the issue. On the other hand, transfer the coin to cold wallet and sell via localbitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:24:38
It is. You don't have to buy a whole coin. .001 Bitcoin is still valuable. .0000001 Bitcoin is still valuable and purchasable.

Thanks Craig! While you're here, and I apologize for hijacking the thread, but a lot of us are deeply concerned about our purchases being labeled high risk and getting our purchases honored afterward. I have this concern about my account since I made a larger purchase last week an will be waiting until Monday to receive my BTC. What steps can we as users take?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:45:39
I can understand your confusion. This is the security committee hearing. The economic hearing is afterward.

I'm eliminating my risk. I'm closing in on a complete return of my initial investment which I will put back into my savings account. At which point I will still have a significant amount of coin. This is all part of my long term plan which is as follows:
Purchase coin with 10% savings balance. Purchase coin at a rate of 0.1BTC/week regardless of price. Once initial investment has doubled, sell BTC for fiat in the amount of initial investment. Risk is then eliminated. Hold coins in cold storage for long term, keep 10% in hot wallet for purchases.

@_date: 2013-11-12 20:16:30
With a big bonus coming at work in the next few months, 20% would have been fine. It depends on the person and the level of risk they're willing to take compounded with the amount they can afford to live without. I could never see that money again and I'd be okay with it.

$6000-that's the cost of a 600,000mh/s machine. Using a calculator, you'd maybe pay it off in a few months if you can get it in time to compete with the difficulty. Power costs aside (because I don't know yours), you'd make a few bitcoin and, within a year, it wouldn't be profitable at all, really. Try out a calculator. They're really helpful-not trying to knee-jerk. I just bought 10 asic block eruptors to do it as a hobby. I'll make .5 btc this year if I'm lucky.
