Who did he threaten? I didn't read anything like that. People don't like the guy including me but if he can't speak then none of us can long term. Eventually we would all have an opinion that Google, Facebook, Twitter or PayPal CEOs might disagree with.

That's more a technicality. They partner with small banks to sell bank services.

I think the point is to silence him. PayPal is going after his income stream. YouTube demonetizes people and it affects their income stream. Again, I don't like the guy myself but its not right that he is singled out. I have an idea he's mostly kabuki theater and doesn't probably even believe most of the stuff he says. And he's probably being targeted hoping on hope that Trump chimes in so Trump can be painted with every crazy thing Jones ever said that probably Jones doesn't believe himself. It makes me not want to use Google, Twitter or PayPal again if I don't have to. I don't like jackasses but I dislike virtue signalers more. But that's me.

Do you think he shouldn't have access to banking because he's a jackass? Because there's a lot more jackasses out there than him that still have rights. Where's it end? Animal Farm?

At least it's not tether.

But once a company becomes as a utility it's not so simple. I can't stand the guy, he talks over his own guests. But he should be able to make a jackass of himself. The Internet may not always be free. We kind of do need an Internet bill of rights.

There's buying going on OTC. The bigger buyers aren't getting bitcoin on the open market where they would drive the price.

Positive is simply a decision as you will see in these comments.
@_date: 2018-08-29 20:06:24
It's disingenuous to say all the recent buying is from Asia. Various emerging markets have picked up buying as well as bitcoin is becoming a safe haven asset.

Does it come standard with the flame thrower package?
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:43:18
Not surprising. Driving down the price with FUD giving bankers more time to buy over the counter.
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:48:23
That's a good trade anyway it goes.

Predictable. Totally predictable.

Google isnt anywhere close to dumb. It also doesnt return unfiltered results for many search terms.
@_date: 2018-08-17 16:00:17
Maybe some entity buying over the counter and off the exchange. Probably thats how to manipulate without being noticed. Buy off the exchange and sell on the exchange.

Its too bad that the swap supported that coin. Good job getting rid of it though.

It never has to pass for the corporate media spread the FUD around. Here we are perpetuating the story like one of the sheeple.

BCH was the original crypto cancer. Nothing has changed.

Equities have been pumped by central banks. When the banks werent buying equities themselves they were giving low interest money to companies to buy back their own stocks. No matter what politics you personally believe in that isn't capitalism. 
Corporate fascism maybe. Nowhere near a free market at any rate.
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:51:18
The media is fake. It is a puppet whose strings are pulled by the powerful. There's nobody breaking actual stories. It's just a tool to manipulate and control the sheep. The powerful could give a rats ass about the environment, other people or anything except themselves.
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:36:20
Exactly whereas tulips that no coiners like to bring up had 1 cycle. This is not a bubble because it doesn't go to zero. People are now blind as to what a market that finds a price looks like because stocks and commodities are manipulated.

The bch fork should have called itself bcash... the real bcash.

Google was the best thing ever until it wasn't. I miss what Google was. Now I use duck duck go even though it gives me Wikipedia results first for almost anything I search for.

Bitcoin is not acting like a bubble because it doesn't go to zero and is no more worthless than paper money. I have a 10 trillion dollar bank note from Zimbabwe to remind me to hold Bitcoin. Banks are dumping toxic assets off the books and they are being bought with printed dollars. Inflation will be coming like we haven't seen since the late 70's early 80's.

For the last couple of years it seemed like like he was just being kept alive so he could be wheeled around stages and the voicebox could be programmed to make him to appear to say many marvelous and politically correct things. He is at rest now.

People who think this whole thing was about them because they did not buy a pizza with their bitcoins.

Waiting for blockchain companies to take market share from Google. Everybody used AltaVista or Lycos not that long ago. They were the best thing ever too until they werent.

Fake news. Or has the word fake become redundant when describing the word news? 
@_date: 2018-07-22 01:08:16
We primarily vote against candidates in the US now not for them. So Hillary is responsible for Trump winning not bitcoin or Vladimir Putin.

The twins ETF was rejected again and the news implies the CBOE ETF was rejected in misleading headlines. Corporate news is mostly misinformation.

Good. The worst thing that ever happened to bitcoin was the bitcoin futures. Second worst was the dysfynctional human whales.

Technicals only work in free markets. Free markets no longer exist. Bankers are pulling your strings by manipulating technicals making you sell them your bitcoin cheaper and cheaper. Until the bastards patent every piece of it and buy it all up what they can't steal the patents for. So pretend you know what to do by reading bankers tea leaves if you want. It's bullshit though. Hold or be a debt slave until the day you die.
@_date: 2018-12-29 00:39:25
Exactly. So why does bitcoin get hammered when equities go down? Same way gold and silver gets hammered when equities go down. When they ought to be going up if we had a free market in anything anymore. Right before the plunge protection team buys the Fking dip in equities right before 400pm every time. Because any alternative to equities has to look worse than equities so investors dont flee?
Purely rhetorical question. The answer is obvious.
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:02:28
Where's the commonality between equities falling and Bitcoin falling? None. Right now with the world turmoil as it is... equities imploding... gold, silver and bitcoin should be flying. 
Should be flying... if there were free markets for any of these. So whoever said the answer might scare you... dead on right. If it doesn't scare you it should.
