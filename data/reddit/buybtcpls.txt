It's just a meme lol. If you don't like something somebody does, is your first thought normally to insult their intelligence? Feel free to block me if you want.

What if I spend MORE than I make on bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-05 07:08:47
That's just KYC (Know Your Customer). That's pretty standard stuff. Unless you're trying to buy Bitcoin anonymously or avoid the tax man, it's no problem. I gave them the info they wanted and was able to immediately withdraw it once I got through the verification process.

Is he actually wanted by the US feds as well? I know he's crazy but I didn't realize he was THIS crazy.

He doesn't. Plain and simple.

Thanks for the info, u/CumFrostedcake

Except this doesn't allow for immediate locking in of prices, so if Bitcoin goes up $1k in the time it takes your Fiat to clear, you end up worse off anyways. 
But Cash App gives more Bitcoin per dollar compared to Coinbase anyways, so that's what I've switched to recently.

Bitcoin won't see mass adoption because everybody is paranoid of banks handling their money. Bitcoin will see mass adoption because governments and businesses will realize it's a secure way to send payments faster and cheaper than with cards. When real adoption comes, there will be bank-like services for Bitcoin that most average people will use, but Bitcoin will still provide the opportunity for users to be their own bank.

The Kardashians have a ton of fans. There's no correlation, it's just impressive that Bitcoin is more popular than them.

So you're a prophet or something?

I don't know about monero, but Bitcoin can be anonymous. It isn't automatically anonymous or not anonymous. Most exchanges have what's called KYC or Know Your Customer. That basically means you have to prove your identity before you can buy any cryptocurrencies. When you buy Bitcoin and send it to your personal wallet, every transaction with those Bitcoin can be tracked, and because the exchange has your identification, that means the government can get your information. 
However, your name isn't associated with your wallet directly, and you don't have to buy Bitcoin through an exchange. I don't condone illegal activity, but I've heard stories of people buying Bitcoin in person with cash, setting up a PO box with a stolen identification, purchasing drugs on the dark web and sending them to that PO box. Then the only way the Bitcoin transaction wasn't anonymous is because the person you bought them from saw you, and the cameras of the post office saw you. 
Bitcoin can be very close to anonymous if you do it right. Most people don't go through all that trouble though.

There will  only ever be 21 million coins. Spread that out evenly across our approximately 8 billion people on Earth, and the average amount is .002625btc, or $23 worth at today's price. Use that info to make your own decision on what somebody should be holding if you like. I personally think everybody should shoot for the 21 million club and own one full Bitcoin.

Nope, I'm not a bulltard. I don't even hardly check the price anymore.

I haven't sold any, but in Fiat value, my investments in Bitcoin are up around 45%. I've been DCAing in ever sense, and my total cost average is $7,500.

Just got to work and my coworker told me he made his first Bitcoin purchase today at the absolute top, 30 minutes before a $2,000 drop lmao

I don't understand the purpose of dusting though. Can't any wallet be spied on regardless?

Right? People in this sub don't realize how many wealthy people there are in the world.

Do you have a source for that?

I would sign it if it was just for Bitcoin and if it was grammatically correct.

Thanks for always doing these posts! 
I do have a question for you. On a post a few days ago, I saw a Venezuelan commenting on how Bitcoin enthusiasts severely exaggerate how much Bitcoin is used in Venezuela. He or she said that Bitcoin signs are far and few between in stores, and that Bitcoin hasn't even come close to becoming a regular currency there. He said USD was more of a currency than Bitcoin there. 
Apparently he lives there, but it seems to contradict a lot of what I hear about Venezuela and Bitcoin. What's your input on what he or she said?

I mean it looks good, but who's the intended audience? I feel like this wouldn't mean anything to the average person on the street.
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:15:30
Ooh okay then it's great! I wasn't criticizing, was just curious of your intent. If you enjoy it, then it's perfect.
@_date: 2019-12-20 18:03:37


Then there's no point in even discussing it. Your mind is clearly made up without facts to back it up.

Why the fuck does this have four platinums
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:35:50
Right, so let's just eliminate all easy on-ramps for Bitcoin so we can "stick it to the man." That'll be good for Bitcoin!

Does the author know what he or she is talking about?

What does being vegan have to do with being underfed? I was vegan for a bit while weightlifting and was getting in approximately 3000 calories a day.

Wow imagine saying this to a stranger totally unprompted.
