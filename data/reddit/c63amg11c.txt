Gox news is really going to drag the price down just wait until China hears. This is good news but it's not going to help right now.

Already seeing a little action in anticipation of the "big news". Watch the big sells into the news though.

I'm so ready for this to just take off...

Serious question: What are you iPhone smashers doing to get out of your contract or are you just eating it?

Damn these guns look bad ass.
@_date: 2014-05-06 16:38:07
Yeah but what could really be done to prevent this?
@_date: 2014-05-06 16:38:58
This is pretty cool.

Smart woman. Using the angle on how bitcoin can save small business money in credit card fees. If more businesses actually knew this I bet they would adopt bitcoin much faster.

This is starting to go viral.
@_date: 2014-04-02 15:00:46
Good news? This would be amazing news if it actually happened.

Anyway I'm done posting here, just my thoughts could be wrong but I put my money on I'm not.

Everyone here is expecting it, what sucks is everyone else who doesn't follow Bitcoin will see this as another hit. Soon the news articles will follow of rejection. Facts of life. Short-term affect on the price so I'm looking for more around 1k.
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:05:22
It won't happen with in 15 minutes lol.
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:51:01
