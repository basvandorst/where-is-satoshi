3 examples of things that can be disproved with science and then ... bitcoin?

I picture you just in your underwear with a big white plastic 5 litre bucket of glue in between your legs, bending down and inhaling deeply before rising back up and furiously typing your next sentence with one eye half closed.

Won't be much of a story to tell:
"Back at the end of 2017 a guy made some shit up on Reddit and it got loads of upvotes. Sleep tight kids."

If it's not going to be useful as for everyday transactions then why would the general public use it at all?

Just cook your bitcoins first, 30 mins at 200°C or 390°F should soften them up enough to be easily digested, never eat Bitcoins raw.

Far far faster way to input or use numbers in any shape or form.

Likely will dip down again slightly when it starts to 'stabilize' after the fork but yea it's still steadily gone up for the last few years. I've been buying bits and pieces for a while but have money in an ISA making fuck all and I'm wondering if I should put half of it into BTC instead. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:21:33
Can you afford to lose everything you've put in or intend to put in? If not then don't keep buying. If you can then go ahead. Despite what the die hard bitcoin fans say around here, this is still an unstable high risk, high reward investment. Spread out your portfolio if you genuinely want to invest. Read "The Intelligent Investor" by Ben Graham for some solid general advice/practice.

Honestly I wouldn't buy now I think this is just hype driven, it will drop again soon enough but probably not by much.

How does this compromise his coins?

So you don't really class it as a currency but as something regarded as being valuable by the market, that you would trade in for "real world" currency like dollars or sterling? Isn't that kinda against the point of it as a global currency?

Yes you can if you buy from shops that accept them or have a landlord that accepts them, surely you've seen it as a payment option on websites? If you mean buying from any old shop down the street then no, you cant buy groceries with gold either.

"Bitcoin used to be more than this so imma buy some and wait"
That's the high level "research" going on here. And every time it works out people will brag they saw it coming and any time it doesn't they'll be silent.

Yup fees ruin this plan usually

Yea I see your point just outpace the interest on the mortgage. I guess it also depends on whether you want to spend the extra cash from being mortgage free or further invest I guess. It's sensible to save for the future but not if it reduces your quality of life or takes up all your free time, because if you drop dead at 50 then it wasn't worth it. Depends on their viewpoints like you said.

Someone will likely come in here and tell you their favourite phrase: "The best time to buy was 2 years ago, the second best time is now"
But you should wait for a short time in my opinion, it has just risen significantly in a very short time frame and its value is arguably overinflated and due a correction. People WILL sell at 10k whether holders want them to or not. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:02:53
Assuming you don't invest the monthly mortgage payments you would have been paying into something else now that you're mortgage free

What a load of bollocks. You think Warren Buffet got as rich as he did from investing all his money in high risk, volatile, unknown markets? You can still get plenty rich on low-mid risk long term investments if you research your markets and know what you're doing. The truly rich in this world didn't get there by betting it all on black and hoping for the best.

Ha, you've called people shills and coinbase shit in here 5 times and not recommended a single alternative, how do you think this is helpful?

I sold at greed so I'm happy enough for now, very unstable atm

They are typically paid off from your estate, including joint accounts and properties, so if he had a wife and they had both paid for the house she will likely lose the house and whatever joint account money they had, including all his possessions and personally held money. Anything after that is written off.

Please stop talking with authority on a completely speculative subject

None of this is "proof" of anything ffs, who gave you gold for this nonsense?

It was stupid. It still is stupid. Sure things went his way (apart from the illness) but if they didn't then he would have left a big steaming pile of shitty debt for his survivors. I'm all for buying bitcoin but not to the point if things go south that I'm going to have my life ruined because of it.

100k is still a lot though, you could still invest it in safer options and make good returns or even part pay off your mortgage. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:29:46
You don't, but where I live rent is a bit more expensive than mortgage payments and you get to own and invest in the property at the end of it, and if you chose well by the time you sell on you can make a nice profit.
But in many places renting can be cheaper than owning since the landlord is supposed to cover broken equipment or plumbing/electrics. 
All depends on what you want, how often you expect to move to different areas etc.

I never knew the answer was so simple as to abandon my friends and family and move to an entirely different country and find the perfect job. Thanks friend.

So does Dan just float mostly in the same spot for long periods at a time and maybe dip up and down a bit?
