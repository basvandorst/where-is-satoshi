That "loser" is your master.  The sooner you figure that out, the better off you'll be.

We've got one for WooCommerce. Could WC work for your memberships?  I think it has that option.  If so, I can send over the plugin.

Lol, did Reddit kill the site?  I'm getting -  
Error 522, Connection timed out
@_date: 2014-04-21 16:07:40
Disagree. My belly got a bit bigger from all the free cookies at the Expo. :)

Hey guys, mostly built this as a proof of concept, and would love feedback.  Site is similar to Coinmap, except we've made some improvements.
1. We built it using data from OpenStreetMaps.  Anything you add here will be on Coinmap, and vice versa.  We did this to avoid multiple databases of bitcoin merchants and keep it in one place.  
2. Used Google Maps for visual display, instead of OSM.  
3. To add a listing, login with email or social media account (did this to avoid spam), select your location (address is auto suggested from Google), and boom. No need to add a node on OSM, a little more user friendly IMO.  
4. Added Disqus commenting.
The database can get hung up at times, so we plan on migrating this to MongoDB and make further improvements.  We're also simplifying the navigation as it's a bit scattered.
Thanks in advance!

Yea, it's not yet in the extension gallery.  I can email it to you, though.  We integrate with CAVIRTEX, QuadrigaCX, or you can enter your own public key. 
Wanna PM me your email addy?
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:08:23


Lol.  OSM is better on the display side, you mean?  We went with Google b/c it's the norm.  Few people actually use OSM for directions, or anything map related. 
Agreed on the laggy-ness.  Reason why we'll be moving to a new stack.
Comments on the other aspects, though?

Market maker.

I'll give an instant where this setup is useful - 
I sign up merchants to accept BTC using VirtEx and PocketPOS.  I don't want to hang out in the store during verification.  Instead, I sign them up, get their API key, plug them into Pocket, and they can accept BTC almost instantly.  
If the merchant wants to convert to fiat, or withdraw the coins, they complete verification. This incentivizes the merchant to complete the verification process (it's time consuming, but unfortunately necessary). 
VirtEx does have a huge warning advising you not to deposit BTC if you're not verified.  If verification is an issue, you can use a wallet of your choice to accept BTC and circumvent VirtEx.

Definitely.  I advocate keeping BTC, however a lot of merchants need a way to convert to Canadian dollars and get the cash in their bank accounts ASAP.  This is by far the easiest way.
@_date: 2014-11-20 16:37:52
Lol, fair enough. I still use Google maps on the daily (and many other bitcoiners).
@_date: 2014-04-21 16:42:58
If you can recommend an alternative for converting BTC to CAD easily, I'm totally open for discussion.  
@_date: 2015-08-17 03:41:02
If your brainpower was wasted on Trilema, I'd hate to see where it's well spent.
@_date: 2015-07-20 12:29:23
I'd try bitcoinmaps.info.
@_date: 2015-07-20 12:28:03
Yea, it uses OpenStreetMaps.
@_date: 2015-08-17 03:40:28
What original content ?
@_date: 2015-04-20 21:33:44
Use [Bitcoin Maps](  Same data, but with commenting.

.. and [Mircea set you straight](  'Nuff said.
@_date: 2015-04-20 21:55:10
Your elaboration excites me.  Add them to the post.
@_date: 2015-04-17 15:27:04

Meh, they're teh same thing.

Lulz, I'll let you explain yourself once it's dead.  In the mean time, [thank your lucky trolls](
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:22:58
Agreed.

The majority of gold available is used for hoarding.  Very little is used for industrial purposes.  Silver has more use than gold does.
If you desire something tangible, I recommend you put your Bitcoins in cold storage and cherish the paper it's printed on. :D

Bitcoin pricing will be there on Friday.  The dev team got delayed integrating the BitPay API, and now it's Christmas.  So sorry for the delay.
@_date: 2013-12-22 05:08:18
Clearly wants to make sure they come back, so they'll be taking PayPal and all other major credit cards as well.  Don't you worry!  
  
I love bitcoin, so I HAD to make sure they didn't leave my peeps out.

Hey there - BTC integration is on it's way and you can avoid entering your CC.  The dev team had some delays with API integration and it should be live on Friday.
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:12:44
BTC price will fluctuate.  Price is fixed in USD/CAD and BTC price will be the equivalent at the time of transaction. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:23:47
Take a look at [the new bottle](
@_date: 2013-12-22 05:11:26
I'll put in a good word for you.  A quote from the [Clearly FAQ page]( seems fitting:  
  




@_date: 2013-12-22 00:07:15
SUPER IMPORTANT.  
It was staying consistent with the [original press release]( ;)
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:48:00
I feel your pain, I want to put in my order.  The API integration is taking longer than expected and since its the holiday, everyone is away.  It should be good to go on Friday!
