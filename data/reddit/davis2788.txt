Majority of energy consumed by bitcoin network  are from miners where energy is extremely cheap or free. If you do the research you'll see this energy used is typically from renewable sources primarily hydro.

"Permanent" was not the vocabulary I used in my post. You never gave me sources like I asked you earlier so I'm not wasting my time finding old emails and Reddit posts between SN and Finney for you.  After the 1mb cap was set, any mention or thought of increasing block size lead to a subtle change of subject. If Satoshi didn't have a problem with increasing block size, then why not set the cap to 2 or 4 or 8 or 16mb back in 2010, and just let miners decide what size blocks they want to mine??? Because he didn't want it over 1mb and he knew it didn't have to be. You can argue about scaling all you want, but blocks don't need to be over 1mb, that's why they still aren't lol.... then it wouldn't be bitcoin

Isn't fiat money a ponzi scheme with central banks sitting at the top? Hmmm

BitcoinCash was a failed attempt by Rodger Ver and a group of miners to take over Bitcoin. Failed miserably, he still to this day tries to convince every one that it is the "real bitcoin" or "part of bitcoin". He's no worse than Craig Wright....it's a scam, don't buy it. 
Bitcoin is King

Absolutely....wow. definitely something to think about.

Alts are called alts for a reason. That's all they are....alternatives. plenty of alternatives to gold but but people chose that. Bitcoin is king because people choose it to be. I don't see any reason for that trend to change anytime soon.

Shorting bitcoin is foolish

I hope we do see below 10k. The cheaper the better. I don't have enough yet.

I would never give Starbucks my bitcoin

1mb cap wasn't decided until after the white paper was published. Please source where SN said it was temporary. When asked about increasing block size by colleagues SN was adamant about keeping it at 1mb because of the risks of security to the network. The argument was made (not by SN) that it would need to be increased later to prevent congestion of the network if transaction volume got too high . SN simply said we would deal with that when we cross that road....unfortunately he's not here to deal with it, but regardless 1mb block was something he wanted to keep and his comment on dealing with it when volume got high enough leads me to believe he wanted to do something else rather than increasing block size.... but that's my opinion

Of course he didn't do it alone. He needed the support of a large pool of miners to achieve this. Bitcoin failed to upgrade to 2mb because anything over 1mb well... isn't bitcoin... just another forked altcoin like bch on a worthless network.  All increasing block size does is give miners another tool to fight each other over finding new blocks, increases centralization of mining, and most importantly it decreases security of the network.
If that's what your looking for, then I guess BCH is for you.

You ever played sarcastaball?

Yeah you go ahead and day trade bitcoin like it's a stock. eventually you'll lose your coin to people like me who only buy and hold. 
If your coins are in a trading account, you're just that much closer to losing them. 
You don't got a private key, then you don't own them. 
By all means please short.... I love cheap bitcoin.
