Thats exactly how I drew it down on paper a minute ago. Awesome!

So one can leave the channel open for further transactions to happen inside the Lightning Network, not necessarily between me and Bob, but also others who can use our channel. But then when does one close the channel?
Sorry for these stupid questions, just trying to understand, since everybody is explaining the Lightning Network in a very theoretical way.

That clarified a lot. One basically can say to Bob "hey I send you one bitcoin over our channel, and since you have a channel with Mary, you can send her one bitcoin over your channel with her" (given enough balance is there)
This process can be chained together to reach people from all over the world.
Am I right there?

Huge block size would make it more expensive to run a full node, since storage would fill up much faster, therefore you would need more harddrives.
Don't think that companies will be able to get their hands on those coins. You essentially have a contract which enables you to claim your coins at any time. Also the coins cannot leave your channel except when you close it.

Yeah that's absolutely true. What I wanted to say is that right now it is easy even for a normal person to run a full node on his normal PC. With bigger block sizes the blockchain would grow much faster and it will sooner become a problem for normal PCs to save a copy of the blockchain. But then again, at some point it won't be possible anyways.

As I understand it there is a fee if you use someone else's channel.
Security is given by the multi signature contract which both users store a copy of. There's also a mechanism that allows only the latest version of the contact to be used to close the channel. You don't need to trust the other party.
Just increased block size is bandaid solution in that this limit will be reached at some point in time. With LN you can free the blockchain from small "unimportant" transactions. Personally I think that at some point we have to increase block size by a bit, but I'm really no expert

Ah, so money can't leave a channel. So it works similarly to correspondence banks for international payments. 
Yeah, probably gonna read the white paper.
