apparently "soon" you'll be able to withdraw $$ via moneypolo

"USD Deposits Temporarily Suspended" might be one reason.

That's quite slow. SEPA deposits from UK to Bitstamp are same day.

nope - still waiting after 6 days :(

It is possible but you have to keep taking your money out the selling bitcoin exchange and back into the buying exchange, which would be fine except your bank might not be top happy about it.

what country are you in?
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:54:24
i've been waiting 3 days for transfer. you just have to check out their facebook page to see how many people are upset at missing funds :(

that's pretty weird of your bank - I'm with Natwest which is part of the royal bank of scotland and I can do bank transfers at home. you just need one of those card reader devices

that's awesome. I'm still waiting for a SEPA from Bitstamp after 8 days.

but yeah, localbitcoins...or (i hate to say it) eBay - can be tricky and expensive though, but I successfully buy some litecoins off there once.

just had a verification approved from Bitstamp so things must be sorting themselves out.
