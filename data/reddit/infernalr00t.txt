Remember that the other day was watching a video on YouTube about a new vehicle from the US army. Don't know if was true, but the vehicle was too fancy according to the video, too many things that in a battlefield are useless and also means a higher risk of failure. 
Then remembered Bitcoin, and yes, doesn't have too many fancy features, and probably could be a lot better, but maybe the idea behind was make it to be able to survive against the worst conditions, just like anything build to go to the war.

To be fair it provides some kind of privacy. Right now if you open a lightning channel that transaction can be easily identified on the blockchain, the same for multi signature.

@_date: 2019-12-07 05:38:14
Truth: Bitcoin price is so low(18m of btc already mined) because most of the owners keep their btc at exchanges. 
This allow exchange not to buy huge amount from miners and keep the price low. The moment users start moving their btc from exchanges to their own wallets price would explode because exchange would be forced to buy more btc from miners. 
Even I'm sure that exchanges are doing fractional reserve. They have statics about how much btc are keep on exchange for trading and how much is moved to wallets. That way they just have the amount of btc that statistics show is going to be moved. The other btc for trading are just btc stored on a sql database.

Not really. Bitcoin have three entities, the miners, the devs, and the users, everyone specialized. When we have a troubles, like segwit, when one of the entities try to take over the network the other must act. Devs take a technical side, users the another and miners, sadly that's a 2 vs 1 vote. 
The same if devs want to create inflation, the users and miners must take a side. But we aren't sheep's that are going to be controlled.

IMO this isnt even the future, the future is paying for content, sad?, not really, services are free because you are the product. how did you change that?, by paying. Check satoshis place, you dont create an account, you pay for an account, devs get the money and you dont give your mail. Even webLN is working in a user ID using lightning so you can access services easily.
just think, you want yo download a rom from a site, you need to surf across a sea of ads, what if instead you buy the rom?, or an account for 1 year?, you paid and the ads are gone, the devs get money, a better UX.

Sometimes i feel the need to answer guys in Twitter but then remind that Bitcoin probably is going to outlive them. 
So is just a waste of time.

Satoshi is a small IA who traveled back in time from the year 2140 to save us from ethereum.

Still useless because Iran is baned from swift. 
What Iranian must do is mine Bitcoin.

Hard lesson that must be learned. 
If we keep huge amounts of BTC in exchanges then there is more reason to do a rollback, or become more recurrent. 
And a rollback is bad because if a poor guy in Africa loses his BTC, nobody cares but if an exchange loses that BTC then everyone drives crazy. 
The point is that BTC in exchanges belong to the exchange, just like the money in the bank belong to the bank, not to you, even legally. 
Money in exchange is easier to confiscate that BTC in users wallet. 
Then becomes clear that exchanges are a menace to BTC, and all of us. And even I'm not talking about potential fractional reserve. 
People need to learn in the hard way and we as maximalists must be vigilant.

Demand segwit people.
Still we have a problem. I have installed a lot of LN wallet, custodial and non custodial. And with exception of bluewallet none of them use segwit. Even bluewallet don't use native bech32 address. 
Almost 3 years and even new wallets dont use segwit, clearly we have a problem.

If you move BTC around exchanges maybe you need liquid, a sidechain faster than Bitcoin to move your Bitcoin.
