Cheers I'll pass it onto the author.
Just because everyone else uses neo4j, doesn't mean neo4j is better suited.  They're both Graph Databases. I think u'll find the use of neo4j is more a personal preference that came down to it being more like an RDBMS than Caley can be.
Though, I'm all ears if there's a better technical reason for using neo4j in this instance

Google ads is great at showing YOU ads that are relevant to YOU.  So I guess you've been searching and reading a bit on Neucoin or another keyword that ad targes lately ;)
I am served Native Instruments ads like no tomorrow no matter where I go.

They did? that seems contradictory to the plugin repository full of bitcoin plugins.
WooCommerce plugin for Wordpress + BitPay's woocommerce plugin, solved.

correct.  that coindesk post above is just about removing bitcoin as a payment option for WordPress.com upgrades/features

I have music on there.  Right now it works like this..
I upload my songs to BitTunes, they start distributing them to buyers.  From that point on, buyers of the track are seeding that song to other buyers.  Unless in the top 100 each song is priced at 50c and 50% of the sale of every track is put aside for "Music Movers" (peers) and 50% for the Music Maker (the uploader).  So as a peer you can earn up to 25c per sale of the song for being the bandwidth provider.  Once in the top 100 the price of the song goes to $1, bittunes will take 10% of the sale, the mover gets 40% and the maker gets 40%. 
The prices are USD, the prices are fixed and the distribution of funds is fixed (the maker cannot adjust any of this).  It's only on Android mobile, it runs in the background and destroys mobile data, there's no way to be a music mover without running it on and Android, which means I only run it on my tablet because it's WiFi only.
I don't feel like these guys have it, they're slow to move, they have grandiose ideas and all in the name of 'paying the artist more' when in reality they're sapping value and convenience and also giving artists little in return.  Everything is riddled with marketing buzz and hype, the reality is quite the opposite.
Apparently they're working on a dekstop app in java too.

From what I can see so far it is only available in Payments hub (possibly only in North America).
Though i've been told numerous times actual PayPal integration is on the cards.
Side note: BrainTree's VZero SDK is currently accepting private beta participants for coinbase integration -  - this allows you to transact PayPal, credit cards, BTC, Apple Pay and more

I've been trying to get access to this since the day it was announced.  Been pestering one of their developer advocates often about it.
