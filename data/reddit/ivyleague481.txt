Nice try tyler
@_date: 2015-06-25 18:45:08
TIL: I am bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 03:28:49
Interesting. Hope that is the case for this. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:26:26
Use dash/darkcoin. Bitcoin's anonymity solution is not coming along at any speed whatsoever. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 11:49:05
Why not both? 
@_date: 2015-06-28 12:34:58
until we get change
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:39:30
Would it not be smarter for a Zimbabwean to hold most wealth in gold? Although a little more cumbersome, the risk of your asset not losing its value would outweigh anything else. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 16:57:52
But how do they get the money out to give it to you?
@_date: 2015-06-13 15:15:16
Mark Zuckerberg is definitely a smart guy and was likely more in tune with social network desires at that time.

He will be fine in the way that he may be be poorer than he would have been if bitcoin goes tits up. But hes not gonna become a junkie and go to prison. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:50:33
Except it won't. Because few will use it. So much so that those with insider information will have so little to gain as to not even share the information. Mark this comment and get back to me in a couple years. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 12:30:22
Yea, his idea of bitcoin sucks. I would never need it. I have never sent money internationally.
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:26:40
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:44:10
Exactly. These people would not be looking for an investment opportunity, they are looking to hold value. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:18:19
Safer alternatives to hiding the cash is to invest in an experimental currency? 
@_date: 2015-06-29 16:35:02
I don't mind having a few ludicrous conversations, but bitcoin has a very much uncertain future. Give it more time, if we are doing things correctly and the protocol works, the confidence will come and you won't sound silly. However, right now, you sound silly.  
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:19:48
Except this time we got mass attention. Everyone has heard of bitcoin. Running out of new investors. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:48:26
too slow
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:01:26
How so?
@_date: 2015-06-27 21:13:18
If he loses everything, just has to keep working. Not having savings isn't the end of the world, its just painful. I dont have any for other reasons. So we would be in the same spot. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:57:05
Not very smart but you will be fine. Got to take the big bets if you want to win big. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:44:43
But a more established one. So likely safer for the time being. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:02:57
But is a lot by gbtc standards. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:54:15
I think you are in some ways correct. It won't take a whole lot and seems to be a large number of people who are unaware of it. But it also doesn't really have a use outside of investing to the everyday person. I have never even purchased anything real with bitcoin, outside of showing someone how it works, I never use it. I hope that the ground breaking application comes out, but I am not certain what that is yet. Remittance, currency escape...? Still seems like we are just hoping for that killer app to appear. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 12:07:08
I think more people would come to bitcoin if there were any level of certainty it would hold value or even be around 10 years from now. A currency out of the government's control, as valuable as that may be, will need to show greater promise of passing the test of time. 
I am a staunch advocate of bitcoin but I cannot say with a straight face to someone looking to protect their money to purchase bitcoin. Currently, it is a high risk investment and not the first thing I would go to if I needed to protect my money from losing value.  
@_date: 2015-06-28 12:16:13
I don't think that is it. I think people push back to any idea that 1) is claimed to disrupt and replace the old system and 2) is said to make them very well off financially if they spend money now. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 23:11:50
The only problem i see, bitcoin is so easy to steal, the government might not even get there fast enough. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 03:31:01
It depends on age. 22 and no savings, not a huge deal. 45 loaded with debt and no savings, huge deal. Don't make this as simple as you are. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 01:36:02
Worst way to blow 1 million coins I can think of. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:54:54
Looks like everyone is heading out on the town. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 14:23:08
That is racist. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 23:29:42
@_date: 2015-06-30 02:11:18
Amazingly wasteful. Handing out loads of money to random people who are just going to blow it and be right back in the same position. I would rather see him invest in infrastructure in the bitcoin economy to make lasting change. Not just some welfare publicity stunt. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 02:04:18
I did it for a little bit, small money. It can be fun. It is a form of entertainment, but you generally leave sadder. It's comparable to slot machines. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 19:26:22
Sounds about right, but let me check my foreskin. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:34:50
You got downvoted hard for explaining yourself. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 02:15:20
I think they misunderstood your question. The answer, "no" for most people. There is hardly an incentive if you cannot get rich off it. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 06:24:23
Sure, we all believe in the idea and the team. But if you told me it was going to be worth 1/10 what you paid in one month, I might have held off and supported the team a little later. Or at least at market price. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 16:27:52
Transportation would be more difficult, but I would guess most are not trying to flee the country. Also, they are likely not insanely rich, so a small amount of gold would do. I would rather do that than risk holding all my savings in bitcoin.  
@_date: 2014-08-14 20:17:59
Maybe 1%. As it stands, there are not a lot of reasons to use it even if you understand it. And even if everyone understands it, ease of use and ease of security is still low. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 04:09:33
can they buy condoms on overstock?
@_date: 2014-08-14 20:48:20
It is like but for religion. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 06:54:00
More like a debit card. In a world of $0.60 fees for bitcoin is the world I don't use bitcoin. By the time its over, bitcoin is going to have no advantages.

@_date: 2014-12-15 05:16:52
That's right. Never spend your bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-11 00:20:03
Keep asking them. The people around here like to act as if bitcoin is perfect. It is not. Needs work. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 15:35:33
Sanity is no longer a trait you wish to have?
@_date: 2014-08-07 00:39:45
There are few and far between who have made real money off bitcoin in the last 8 months. There are those who got lucky trading and those who didn't. Fuck off with your bullshit. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 14:16:36
I'll pay $0.03. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 22:01:51
I am not certain what I am looking at.
@_date: 2015-06-30 02:35:00
That is not how this works. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 16:24:29
It wouldn't. Bitcoin sucks. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 04:05:54
 like it, but unlikely to happen. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 20:07:02
Ease up.

@_date: 2014-09-12 02:09:44
yea r/buttcoin are bitcoin supporters. just not insane. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 14:26:05
Oh yea, that too. Quick sign of crazy. Keep those inside. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 12:28:33
Very true. Now let me inside. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:40:21
I fee like this meme is missing a line. "nobody bats an eye..."
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:45:54
People already understand that. When I buy bitcoin, I do not think I am buying stock in whatever, I am buying something that I think will be valued higher at a later point. Same with SJCX. If the storage system works and is valuable than SJCX will be in higher demand.
@_date: 2014-07-29 11:20:38
What's the pricing on "locking" it in?
@_date: 2014-07-15 15:12:52
I am beginning to think they have a good percentage of mining power actually under their direct control. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 16:41:23

@_date: 2014-08-06 14:56:06
Everyone is selling out. Dump it fast. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 19:04:55
Oh, is this the sequel to the first one? 
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:49:37
Tell them you do not want that feature. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 14:51:24
Thanks for the response. I am not sure I understand. The price I lock in may range +/- 1-2% of total?
@_date: 2014-10-06 00:16:42
Then the suckers will buy back in again and the prices will rise for a little before cashing out to new lows. Rinse repeat. Move on.
@_date: 2014-07-30 04:01:20
Not sure. I'll ask around.
@_date: 2014-07-17 12:05:04
right away sir! pshhh
@_date: 2014-07-19 18:37:15
Becasue this is r/bitcoin. Not r/decentralizereddit.

I am infiltrating the shills. I need to gain their trust first. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:04:23
Proof. I don't think that word means what you think it means.
@_date: 2014-08-03 00:11:27
Did early investors pay too much per storj? It seems like the market has spoken. Hopefully there will be some compensation for early investors who paid the set value, that was much too high. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:21:47
Good. Someone needs to fill the 3600 that won't be released everyday. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 02:31:50
And the other option is pay standard high fees
@_date: 2014-08-11 00:24:16
Regarding 1) if I want to sell my car to someone, I have to sit around with them and wait for it to clear. This is not the end of the world. But still an issue that exists. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 21:50:43
Does it happen all the time?
@_date: 2014-07-31 15:17:06
Good call. Kids are more important than bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:26:24
@_date: 2014-08-06 14:38:41
At this development, maybe. It would need to at least combat inflation though. And as tired as this is, everyone would have abandoned the internet if it were stuck in '88 too. Bitcoin needs time to advance. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:04:50
I tell everyone I know not to invest in bitcoin
@_date: 2014-08-23 21:17:42
bitcoin is overvalued. Prob worth more like 20 cents a satoshi. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 04:12:41
look pretty cool. add more content. but i have a 2 cm penis so waht do i know
@_date: 2014-08-03 00:36:24
I just wish the market set the value for storj, so early investors could grow with the company and be rewarded for the vote of confidence and initial funding. Would it be so bad to allow them that? 
At this price, you are dissuading others from investing because they realize that currently it is overvalued. I understand that it can't be used yet, and that is why the early investors are taking the risk and saying we believe you will pull this off. And if you do, we hope to be rewarded for helping. We aren't looking for a guarantee, but a chance to benefit for the early vote of confidence.

Hi Naidle,
This is Anthony from Coinbase. I know it can sometimes be a little too cumbersome to get used to the receive feature. Thank you for your recommendation. I will pass it along! If you have any other questions, please locate our email address and use it you sonvabitch.

@_date: 2014-08-12 00:29:29
I generally make cash sales. $3k for my car. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 11:42:43
I wasn't disagreeing with that part. More so the part where you say, 'why do I care about the average joe?" The average joe is when the real change comes. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 00:20:32
No quotes necessary. They need to be fixed eventually. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 12:17:13
I want both of those to happen. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 20:10:00
A delusional cult...right now. I don't know who will actually be right in the end. Given enough time, everything will be replaced. It is just a matter of when and by what.
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:06:17
From what I can see, regulation seems to be the only real problem. The other points you make are just pains for any bitcoin business. And you seem to assume users will need to read up on bitcoin.
Bitcoin should be on the back end, user does not need to touch. They don't need to know about bitcoin. 
Network effect, I don't care. Once anyone can save 10% on sending money home without strings attached or reading a book on bitcoin, it will spread.  
@_date: 2014-08-09 01:48:14
Yea, 1000 new people. 1 million wallets

You don't have to resort to stripping. Go back to school and become a doctor. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 02:46:04
It is easier to bet bitcoin because you know it is going to be worthless soon anyway.

@_date: 2014-08-14 14:30:04
Mainly that you never get it back.

That's what they get.

CRASHINGGGG SELLLLLL
@_date: 2014-08-04 11:03:59
I do not, they may still have. But I think this is a step in the right direction. The less physical contact and the more spread out drug dealers are the better. If 90% of drug trade happened over the internet, I think you would see a great reduction and drug violence and arrests. Let alone, it would employ much less people. You don't need gang on every street corner.  
@_date: 2014-10-06 00:37:38
If I am going to buy a donut at the nyc bitcoin fair I would rather not hassle with fees or setting fees. It doesnt have to be this hard bitcoin. Change.

Don't worry. Your idea isn't gonna work. That's the point.
@_date: 2014-08-14 14:19:37
a) the price is locked in at what you buy it for at that instant. 
b) Yep, I would call them up to give permission to allow Coinbase through. Sometimes they 'think' it is fraud. 
But probably knows best.

For you.
@_date: 2014-08-13 21:18:29
Get your head out of your ass. Venezuela has an inflations rate of 60% and their average citizens aren't jumping into bitcoin. Sounds like you need to take into consideration the "average joe" needs. 
If bitcoin were average joe friendly you probably would see places like Venezula kick up the usage quite quickly. But you are too busy telling people to screw the average joe. Good thing you are not a developer. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 20:43:52

About to steal my first bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-08-03 14:23:30
But bitcoin transaction fees will just be going to miners, so those should not reflect the extra stuff thrown on top by companies. The difference with bitcoin is I can say no thanks I don't want to use coinbase or bitpay, too many fees. I'll secure and send my money myself for free. I can't do that with fiat. 
  
@_date: 2014-08-23 21:19:36

@_date: 2014-08-10 15:07:13
Well that makes bitcoin a little less cool. Maybe I will just use the altcoin that I can buy coffee with and send $10,000 to my relatives. At 500 transactions per sec, a reasonable amount if used for everyday items, a transaction fee of 1 cent would pay out $500,000 per day to secure the network. If bitcoin cannot accomplish this on $500k, maybe we should be looking into solutions other than this archaic mining technique. I think we will find a solution to this problem, and I was hoping it would be bitcoin, but starting to wonder from people's general lack of care about solving it.  
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:10:43

I have friends like you. You are the guy who is always the last one to see change. Waiting around for mainstream approval. To tell you its safe. Anyone who immediately discards bitcoin is foolish. As is anyone who invests his or her life saving into it. 
The smart people are cautiously anxious. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:41:47
I don't pay that fee with my bank account. And yes, I think interactions with bitcoin through services should fade away. They hopefully won't be needed as we transfer wealth without middlemen.

Being on the brink is no way to insure confidence, sounds like one failed step from a tumble. I think bitcoin needs just a few tweeks. Hopefully it is malleable enough to adapt. 
As for your edit: with that on the table, I do not think have time for bitcoin. Need bomb shelters asap. lol. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 20:05:43
Bitcoin is not designed so that we can hope that one company or entity acts rationally all the time. And more risk means more payout, how close can we ride it. People shoot their own feet all the time.

Mining more coins doesn't help to spread the idea of bitcoin. What got many of the users here today? The crazy rise in value in November caught their interest. The possibility to make money drives adoption much faster than anything else.  
@_date: 2014-08-10 20:30:53
Probably true, and I would hope so. But as bitcoin gets larger it seems to get less flexible. Hopefully it will be able to adapt quickly enough and see solutions far enough away.

Is it insanely convenient? The locking in system sounds similar to a gift card. Most people would likely not like this idea. I for one, would not enjoy the hassle or like my money being tied up for a month. That is fine if I go to starbucks and really only them. But I frequent many places,  I would not like this system. This makes bitcoin less convenient than cash. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 15:25:13
People working toward a solution rather than saying, "Whelp, bitcoin won't be used for that." That is what I like to see.

Well I think you answered your own question. Why would someone pay a small fee to use a different crypto? Once all the hype and newness of cryptos pass and they are just seen as money, people will move to the cheapest most convenient option, and that will be the use of just one coin.

Third worlders and average joes have most things in common when it comes to bitcoin. They both want security, ease of use for their bitcoins and the assurance that their bitcoins aren't going to be worthless in 1 year. 
There is still uncertainty in the bitcoin atmosphere. Whether you have 60% or 2% inflation, the average person--third world or not--isn't quite ready to dump all their money in. That is very evident. 
Don't you think it is about time to address average joe's concerns?

Thank you for your input. I am reading through the link now. Good to see members actively trying to improve bitcoin. I think bitcoin currently does have a few shortcomings and I am anxious to see how we move forward.

I do not think so. Each company will likely run to maximize profit, ie no wasting resources on mining. Why should our company cut our profits to secure a network for everyone else as well. We are less competitive now.

@_date: 2014-04-17 21:28:32
Interesting response. Let me see if it checks out.
1. Yes, they are poorly drawn. So is South Park, Cyanide and Happiness and several others. Although it is not aesthetically pleasing, they are still funny. The face has a downward turned :( to indicate sadness. Not bemusement. 
2. The comic zooms out to reveal more of the picture. In comedy this is called building the joke. Generally, they give you more information although not wholly pertinent to the punchline, but necessary to build anticipation.    
3. What you said about OP's mother was funny. Mainly because you built up anticipation by dragging out 1 and 2. Much the same way the comic delivers its punchline.   
4. You missed the joke entirely. Allow me, in short: panel 1 and 2 make you think that this is how the world is with only bitcoin, in flames and falling apart. Then it zooms out to reveal it is only a picture and the only thing that has really changed in the world is that he paid with bitcoin instead of fiat currency. 
The Detroit comment is called a loaded punchline, delivering two jokes. One making it clear it is just a picture. And two, a tongue in cheek reference to Detroit's floundering economy. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 21:30:10

Long term interest. The more certainty there is about the future of bitcoin, the easier it is for people to invest in it. And having a scalability issue does not instill confidence. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:27:34
I did not know that. Thank you. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:41:03
I am still horny for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:07:23
Exactly. When you create 3600 new coins a day, there are going to be more sellers than buyers often. We are in crazy, controlled inflation for awhile. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 12:43:16
Then you will be upset it is like r/technology. No banning stuff like china. Then when do they stop.

I was saying a year of losses if we start going into, nov., dec., and january at these prices. 
But I do like your analysis and I do think the mt gox and china situations set us back a little. The VC investments are promising. Regulation is...wait and see.

The use as a store of wealth. That is the problem. 
Bitcoin and gold are similar. As long as people think it is valuable, it will have purchasing power. They are dependent on what we think they are worth. If I think bitcoin is unable to solve a short/long term problem, I do not put my money in bitcoin and it stays the little dwarf that it is until someone creates a better cryptocurrency. If bitcoin gives me confidence in its future, I put money in. It is simple.

Part of your critique was that "it seems like it's being completely drawn by and for the members of this sub."
This is true. Who else do you want him to draw it for? Hardly anyone outside this sub would care to read a comic dedicated to only Bitcoin jokes. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 18:46:48

@_date: 2014-07-11 21:06:26
If this answer is truly so obvious, there would never be more than one company securing the network for a loss of revenue. 
For example, why would say bitpay lose money to secure the network if they KNOW that coinbase will have to? Now whoever has the best poker face wins.

Ghash probably has a good chunk under its complete control. It wouldn't be unrealistic to think they could acquire enough to disrupt the network.

@_date: 2014-07-28 15:50:37
How so, have I misunderstood something?
@_date: 2014-07-13 17:29:23
It works in a free market that has a large startup cost, i.e. buying very expensive mining equipment (much like airlines and planes). If one breaks the pact they know that the other 9 will almost instantly lower to cover the gap, reducing everyone's payout. But they are not stupid, so no one breaks the pact and more money for all. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 20:57:59

@_date: 2014-04-18 22:38:00
Let me teach you something today. When someone asked an obvious question, what it actually means is "why" or "please elaborate". 
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:14:15
seems like the opposite
@_date: 2014-07-11 20:55:37
But becomes a risk analysis game where they do not want to spend the money. So "good enough" might work until it doesn't. Kind of like we see with Ghash.
@_date: 2014-04-04 16:53:02
Where is this at?
@_date: 2014-08-08 19:27:26
Spoiler: bitcoin won't end war. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 17:11:26
There needs to be significant evidence. And they prob have that for a connection to silkroad. I would say you can read about it, and say with a good degree of confidence that he ran silkroad. That is fine. But for one single event, it becomes harder to not run away with misdirected evidence.

You miserable fuck. I cannot address the problems with innovation if the regulations won't even let me get started...the regulations you lobbied for. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 23:02:55
I apologize, you are much more informed than I inferred from your original post. Much of your concerns, I have for bitcoin as well. There does seem to be a shift away from the core ideas that were central to bitcoin in the beginning. Anonymity may still be to come, but I have noticed in just the last few months, that many people are coming to terms with fees not being low. Making bitcoin unusable for day-to-day transactions and purchases seems appropriate to them. This concerns me. As do the central nature and monopoly factor of the exchanges. 
I usually side with tech and say, if we haven't figured it out yet, it will likely be solved soon. However, bitcoin seems to become ever more static and not as "upgradable" and adaptable as I at first imagined. Maybe this will be solved as well, but definitely a concern.  
@_date: 2014-08-12 16:32:20
When will the next ban be announced? The price isn't low enough yet. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 16:14:15
It seems to be what SendBitcoin.mx is doing. I have seen quite a few btc businesses go under though. But it is a step in the right direction. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 02:07:15
Just sent 0.6 btc
@_date: 2015-05-08 22:32:06
So nobody with new coins will be able to move? 
@_date: 2014-07-26 00:55:13
Are you sane?
@_date: 2014-07-28 02:38:42
Well which community would be most able to quickly get you idea up first? I would imagine it to be bitcoin. You are delaying a race we will win.
@_date: 2015-05-01 12:33:28
Well Barry should not say things that are just untrue.

@_date: 2014-08-13 16:44:09
Never. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 20:30:14
Is it likely then that no one will use bitcoin in the future to buy an icecream because the fees might be too high, as determined by the free market?
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:47:53
No, they are not dumb. They are just mentally unfit to see any innovation past what is fed to them on a silver dildo.  
@_date: 2015-05-08 10:47:51
Well bitcoin is stagnant then. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 01:34:37
Could I interest you in some foreskin?

Not an excuse my friend, just how the world understands it. When you touch back down to earth, drop me a message.

You must be mentally challenged. Is this true? Spit up on the keyboard if "yes".
@_date: 2015-05-03 22:47:11
You are right, gs never really steps behind bitcoin and I would be reluctant to believe they would. Digital payments, just like venmo like services. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 15:46:48
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:23:25
Bitcoin would like to distance itself from drug websites. Trying to look profesh right now. Be cool.
@_date: 2014-04-09 02:58:48
That is ok. Welcome back, be nice. lol
@_date: 2014-08-01 23:09:45
Would proof of stake allow for cheap transaction costs? I like the idea of micro payments, but people seem to think bitcoin will not be a viable option for this. 
And is there any risk that someone could actually own 50%? As the economy grows, I would think this would be unlikely.  
@_date: 2014-11-23 20:04:17
I downvoted you, but just for fun. Sorry.

I wouldn't be completely disregarding to the possibilities of a solution. You are currently working with a system that arguably solved a much larger initial problem. Don't put the blinders on yet.

They invested in customer information. Not bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 22:59:30
That is true. It is not just about money for me. It is about seeing something you believe in take flight. And although, volatility is expected, still cuts in sometimes. 
@_date: 2014-08-24 04:52:10
@_date: 2014-08-10 15:14:41
Sure. But if bitcoin doesn't work to solve this transaction fee problem, something else will. Someone always does. And it will replace bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-08-03 06:21:54
Small price for you. For those who invested 5+ btc it is a good lesson on over estimated IPOs. They should have waited until after it hit an exchange if they cared to at least break even. At ~10mil market value. It is quite overvalued. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 23:09:18
I approve of all these, but I need something in addition to this. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 15:51:26
You may be too far down the rabbit hole to even understand this, but bitcoin's future is not certain. It is the reason no smart person would tell you to put all your money in bitcoin.

Well shows can't just keep making the same popculture reference. It comes and as quickly it goes. As a popculture piece, yes bitcoin has died. Much like anything else. But as a currency it is still alive, although interest from the general public has decreased.

@_date: 2014-12-12 21:21:59
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:20:15
Low fees are good. As the network grows from a couple transaction a second to 100s, even low fees should provide a good payout.

@_date: 2015-05-30 13:10:20

But the dollar won't lose half its value in a year. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:36:55

@_date: 2015-07-08 23:58:08
Teaming up at all is not something we are looking to encourage. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 18:12:41
But I feel like these are early warning signs that we are just sweeping under the rug. If there were a guarantee it would never go higher than 15 cents, that might not be bad. But there isn't. It could go as high as $2 and the people would just say that it is better than bofa fees and maybe I just shouldn't use my bitcoin on high fee days if I am too cheap. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 03:50:08
What the fuck...just raise the blocksize so it costs more than a low level operation can afford. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 12:43:08
Yea and in 5 years the sidechain solution may be ready. Right now its not. So we will do the side chain thing when we reach the 20 mb cap. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 00:09:40
Or maybe you are wrong, and that is why investors in general would rather invest in things like coinbase, circle, and other services and not bitcoin itself or another open source project. 
Openbazaar received funding after they decided to establish a company on top of the open source project. Very few if any legitimate investors are throwing money at projects that can't make money but may help bitcoin. 
But then again, there are very few legitimate investors who even own bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 15:07:34

@_date: 2015-07-14 15:49:33
How anonymous is dash already?
@_date: 2015-07-07 20:05:20
Yes, and people are being compensated for that with the earned bitcoin. But the 1mb block limit does not make for the cheapest transactions. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 23:46:20
Stop being naive. It is painfully obvious most investors in the bitcoin space are not investing in opensource projects. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:29:13
I always have to pick my fee with bofa too. So annoying. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:54:56
That $5k number needs to be raised. Way too low for my comfort. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 13:10:25
Are you talking about its blocksize or value?
@_date: 2015-07-09 19:44:56
I know, not ideal. But it just might be the case that bitcoin won't be the anonymous solution. And to avoid harsh regulatory measures, that might be best. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 04:28:55
Damn these core devs sound like very powerful people. Pay millions of dollars just to get one of them to owe you a favor.

Investors are not that stupid. Unless the $21 mil was raised by 1000s of people, no investor is dropping $5 mil because it may go on to help his bitcoin go up in value along with everyone elses.

If i wanted to pay high fees i would just use paypal
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:27:07

@_date: 2015-07-09 19:37:29
Darkwallet seems abandoned. Go to dash instead. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 05:24:07
It probably  wont lose all its value. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 15:06:06
We don't need censorship.
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:48:18
The bitcoin people like a joke that is somewhat relevant and maybe a little technical. Not a joke about the moon distance and the "to the moon" reference that is a worn to death joke on its own. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:54:05
Yea, I know. It is embarrassing. At this stage, it should be more like $100k a day to clog the network. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 17:15:47
Can we make it a little more expensive to bog down the network without the fees being too high? 
@_date: 2015-07-07 18:28:20
I don't use cash for the same reason I don't carry a cd player. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 18:09:00
Guess what, I don't need to send money all over the world and neither do most people. What you should have said is, bitcoin has no use to you unless you want to send money all over the world. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 15:27:25
If it goes up $40 you get lucky too though. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 17:08:23
I know it is not used much. How can you determine what level of anonymity it offers?  
@_date: 2015-07-14 17:16:47
Oh, I see. So there is nothing wrong with dash, it would just need a ton more people to be an effective anonymous currency?
@_date: 2015-07-09 19:33:48
Because the bitcoin network sucks and they won't do anything about it. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 19:55:46
Yea except the cost to use bitcoin exists because of poor development. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 15:57:47
I think I missed the joke
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:51:09

Keep up the good work evan. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 17:01:00
As many as it takes to change the blocksize. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:57:18
The entirely community basically just forgot about blocksize. A little price increase got them thinking they were going to get rich again and not to disrupt the network in anyway.

This would not be a partnership model. This would directly cut into TWC revenue. Which makes me think fon didn't have great pricing, TWC wouldn't want that. 
I pay $55 a month for wifi. I would love for someone to help me with the bill. If I had a friend in my apartment structure, we would split it. Since I don't, I need another option. I would be willing to sell access for as little as $10-15 a month. And my connection has never had problem with 2 other people on it. I would rent out 2 slots. I could reduce my bill to maybe $25 a month. 
If I so desired, I could upgrade to the ultimate 300 internet for $65 that would support 5 devices. I would rent out 4 slots of 300mbps for $15 a month. Everybody wins. My internet is basically free now and my users get 300mps in NYC for $15 a month.

From what you have said, I am now quite confident you have never published a scientific paper. It is always funny how easy it is to spot non-science people.

It is funny to see circle and coinbase just slowly pivot into becoming actual banks. Soon bitcoin will be some optional feature on the side. 
It is great, now I can send dollars to my friend's circle accounts. Bitcoin is an onramp to get millions of user's info.

Still easier than buying stocks. And plenty of people do that. Crypto has little use to everyday people. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 04:23:18
So circle became a bank. Hmmm, wonder if they will still offer bitcoin in a couple years.

@_date: 2015-04-30 15:49:13
Actually that is not true. As circle announced, it is now an easy way to move dollars around too. On their internal ledger. I actually don't even need bitcoin. Deposit fiat to circle, send fiat to a friend who has circle. Just like venmo, it is free too.

Why does it take 10 years? What do we need to accomplish first?
@_date: 2015-04-29 12:50:57
This would not be for random wifi, but for home wifi in apartments. And credit card charges and info would be used be central service, kind of like Uber style.  
I pay $55 a month for wifi. I would love for someone to help me with the bill. If I had a friend in my apartment structure, we would split it. Since I don't, I need another option. I would be willing to sell access for as little as $10-15 a month. And my connection has never had problem with 2 other people on it. I would rent out 2 slots.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is one of two lead investors in a $50 million funding round for bitcoin startup Circle Internet Financial Ltd.
Goldman adds its name to a growing list of Wall Street institutions exploring digital-currency technology’s potential to provide faster and cheaper financial transactions and payments.
Circle, based in Boston, uses bitcoin-based systems to allow customers to digitally store money and transfer it to and from other people and merchants.
The new $50 million injection comes on top of $26 million in prior financing founds for Circle and, according to people familiar with the deal, values the startup at around $200 million.
Goldman declined to comment about its investment beyond a brief statement in the news release from Tom Jessop, managing director of the investment bank’s Principal Strategic Investments Group. He said the investment bank sees “significant opportunities in companies and solutions that have the promise to transform global markets through technical innovation.”
Circle said in a statement that the investment bank’s co-lead investor was China-based IDG Capital Partners, an early investor in Chinese Internet giants such as Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc. The firm’s involvement reflects a new push from Circle to break into the Chinese market.
The funding news coincides with Circle’s move to allow consumers to hold traditional currencies in their accounts in addition to bitcoin. Chief Executive Jeremy Allaire said Circle will start with dollar offerings but then provide Chinese yuan accounts and other currencies once it can do so practically and compliantly.
Also joining the investment round were Circle’s existing investors, including Breyer Capital, General Catalyst Partners, Accel Partners and Digital Currency Group. The firms’ individual contributions weren’t disclosed.
Goldman’s commitment to Circle follows investments by the New York Stock Exchange, Spain’s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA and USAA Bank in San Francisco startup Coinbase, which runs a bitcoin exchange and competes with Circle in the market for bitcoin wallets, with which users store and send digital currency.
Also, UBS AG this month said it would establish a special research lab to explore financial uses for the core technology underlying bitcoin—its so-called “blockchain” digital ledger.
The strategy to offer dollar-based services marks an important shift for Circle, which began as a purely bitcoin wallet service. Mr. Allaire says the inclusion of fiat currencies is consistent with the firm’s founding philosophy.
“We’ve always preached this idea of the hybrid digital economy where fiat currencies can move frictionlessly around the world using bitcoin as the free Internet payment network,” Mr. Allaire said in an interview.
Dollar account holders’ funds will reside with Circle’s Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.-insured banking partner, Silicon Valley Bank of Santa Clara, Calif. It is expected that similar setups will be established with regulated banking entities as Circle establishes access to yuan, euros, yen or other currencies.
Unlike other fast, low-cost, dollar-based digital money-transfer platforms such as PayPal or the digital money-sharing app Venmo, which operate exclusively inside their own “closed-loop” networks, Circle’s inclusion of a bitcoin connection allows users to send money outside the firm’s network. It achieves what Mr. Allaire describes as the goal of interoperability.
Circle is trying a similar strategy in the Chinese market, where hundreds of millions of mobile-phone-toting consumers frequently use closed-loop services such as Alibaba’s Alipay service and the payment app attached to Tencent’s messaging service WeChat. Mr. Allaire called China “an extremely attractive market in terms of consumer behavior and in terms of scale,” highlighting the Chinese government’s desire to develop an economy that is led by consumers that spend their money globally.
It is a similar bet to one being played by Beijing-based bitcoin exchange OKCoin, which is launching a “Superwallet” for storing yuan and other currencies, giving users the capacity to use those funds to purchase goods offered for sale in other countries in bitcoins.
“The opportunities for cross-border payment activity and for digital money are exploding as we speak,” says Jim Breyer, a partner at Breyer Capital and Accel Partners—both early investors in Circle, who in the past has collaborated in Chinese investments by eating dogs.

@_date: 2015-03-14 20:29:32
You know that is not the reason. The real reason is never before was there something he believed could make him super rich. Now, if you believe in bitcoin, every purchase is weighed against its future value. A $50 meal could be $500 in bitcoin next year. No way am I spending it on something trivial when I could be rich next year. 
And I would not quite say you are saving by putting into btc, it is still a risky investment with a big payoff. But if it goes tits up, you didn't save shit.

That is not a correct analogy. 
It is more like there is a foot bridge to a ghost town over a swamp, which is working because people can get in and out fine. Then an investor looks at ghost town and says, 'it is a pretty nice hang out spot actually, I should invest in some real estate there. I could see this being big one day'. Then he realizes they might never be able to build a real bridge over the soft swamp land, limiting the ghost town's potential growth. And he decides that the possible technological limitation makes the investment too risky. 
He then approaches builders and says, if you can prove to me that it is possible to build a bridge that can handle 50 times as much traffic over the swamp, I will invest in ghost towns future. They then say to the investor, 'don't worry about that, the foot bridge can handle 7 people at a time and we only have like 2 crossing right now. When it gets to 6 we will see what can be done. I am sure it is possible'. The investor says, 'Sorry that does not help me. I cannot put my money in the idea that it might be possible. I am leaving.'

@_date: 2015-03-27 15:48:27
Hmm. I want to invest in an anonymous coin but can't seem to figure out if any actually have a good anonymous system. All the dash people say their protocol works and monero's doesn't and all the monero people say the opposite. Maybe I will wait it out and see if trusted third party members are willing to do full analysis of each.

There are not a whole lot of alternatives right now. Heck, I remember seeing how much money was invested in the just-dice site and thinking that was crazy too. After a while without incident, people begin to think it is safe and that the owners have a reputation to uphold and a business to keep running. With just-dice they were right, with evolution not so much.

@_date: 2015-03-25 16:10:08
"We are far from ready" I think you are going to be saying this 2 years from now given how slow the progress is in addressing this issue. People do not want to buy bitcoin if it has technologically uncertain future. 
I can handle volatility and lack of storage solutions/complexity, but I am not prepared to be ok with the idea that bitcoin at the core is not ready for primetime. There is little indication it will ever be.

But more importantly than cost of damages, is what it says about the system. If 100% of btc could be stolen, it would only be a couple billion in damages but would mean the protocol is flawed and the end of bitcoin, until resolved.
I think the percentage that can be compromised is more telling. Say we were trying to evaluate the security of 2 compounds, A with a population of 10 million and B with a population of 100. If 51 of 10 million people were killed in A and half of population B, I would not say B has the better system.

I think launching your own market place on an altcoin will fail, not enough supporters. Now if a sizable current darkmarket decided to accept shadowcash, I might be interested.

 I think we will see more use of the public blockchain to block illicit activities. The most recent evo heist left some exchanges blocking certain high risk coins from withdrawal. Whether we like it or not, bitcoin is not the best use for illicit activities. If a somewhat stable, strongly anonymous (if not monero/dash) alternative came up,  I think you would see a shift to using that instead of bitcoin for these activities.
I agree with your last sentence. So I think bitcoin should stay away from illicit activities. I do not think cryptocurrency as a whole will be able to. Generally, advancements in technology make many things easier and one of them just might be illicit activities. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 18:09:33
