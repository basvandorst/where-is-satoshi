I joined a couple months ago... thought bitcoin was stupid for years...
But as a mathematician.. I now find it incredibly useful and can see it as the future internet currency.
I love learning about stuff like hash algorithms and the math behind it.  
I even started making videos about hiding money in solutions to hard math/riddle problems.  Not trying to shill... but check out my latest and greatest:
Thank you bitcoin... u make life interesting;)

I dont use it for investments.  That's ur job.   Make that shit scares so it keeps its value!
I just wanna make puzzles...     and make people race for the prize... bitcoin is perfect for that.

Thank you for posting link.  This problem is one of the most amazing ones I have done.  Once you figure out what it is....  omg.  If it goes unsolved... I'll add more money in a couple days.
I have done 6 before. . And I promise it is not a scam... as if u really wanted too.. u can solve the previous problems and check the time stamps on the block chain to see that there was a wallet that was open to the public during the post dates of the video.  Problem 3 (which went 3 or 4 weeks being unsolved)  was up to 62 bucks or something. 
If you want to solve that one and see if the keys work...  all u need to do on problem 3 is turn those 1's and zeros to lines.... and it's simply a barcode to scan which gave u private key.
Everything can be verified.    
And this problem is... well...   amazing.  I promise the one who solves it will be very satisfied with the clues given... the problem ... and the solution.  
I am NOT trying to send u out on a random cryptoagraphy hunt.  There is logic behind this.  And a path to take......   good luck.  ;)
And subscribe if u want.... I plan on doing alot more of these.

Sorry I'm new to reddit.  I dont know how to post the same video twice

It's up to 58$ now ;)  ...   the second highest prize ever.  This one might goto a hundred

That's amazing!!!   I love that story lol.
  This problem 7 is a lot harder to even figure out what's going on.  But once someone does find out... then it's all over lol.
I hope this problem goes at least a week so everyone has a chance to think on it.  
It's actually hard to write these problems.  The internet as a collective is alot smarter than me... so it's actually a tough challenge to try to hold them off... yet make the problem still solvable. 
I wanna find that edge...  where it's still a fair problem (not a random code hunt...) but still gives me a couple days of entertainment.
If u wanna know why I do this... its cause I'm a gambler lol.    This is just more fun.  ;)
