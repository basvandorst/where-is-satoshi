how much does it look like if we take a closer look to altcoins?
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:55:05
I like this sense of humour :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:17:03
Does it mean that they are not interested in blockchain tech?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:18:51
Silence! They don't make any press statements about it
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:20:19
remember that after reaching $10K it bounced back from $12K - because it was 10K euro 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:37:51
so did I :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:19:48
is that how it normally works?
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:35:08
so if the bitcoin is overpriced (hypothetically) there is no reason to look at this indicator because it gives false information and it doesn't tell you anything more than a fact that marcet cap = price + supply
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:46:28
do not go 100% into crypto - diversify!

Maybe not value, but cost of production.

yesterday I was explaining uber driver how to buy a bitcoin. By the end of my ride he has already installed coinbase app on his smartphone :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:10:27
bitcoin auto tests are written in python
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:17:58
many thanks for this info!
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:40:24
approximately 40% - nothing more. this is my rule of a thumb.
I don't want to stress my self out and loose all my hairs
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:33:53
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:20:24
... aaaand it drops
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:39:27
I have just seen that bitcoin market cap is bigger that mc Donald’s or Disney. I think such a comparisons are bs
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:37:01
English is not my first language, so my first impression was that this guys have some problems with his speech - than after watching it for the second time I realised that certain words are pronounced correctly than I finally got the joke
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:04:15
what is happening?
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:31:17
lets note down this address - for future reference
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:04:29
Bitcoin in blockchain based. Its open too
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:14:33
somebody tell me why korean bitcoin exchanges are so overpriced?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:08:39
What about cme? Dec 18th? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:06:59
I know. But what isnthe reason for such a sudden demand rise
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:21:28
I can see a lot of red candles !!
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:19:31
it may take a longer while - since it is a new ath. 
or maybe smb will cancel this offer
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:33:45
So why don’t we buy bitcoin on Gdax and sell there?
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:03:44
many thanks dude!
@_date: 2018-05-20 01:18:09
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:41:08
Why should we care about opinion of a guys talking about btc, high on cocaine, with bare feet?
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:05:37
cryptocandies? sth candy alike?
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:42:12
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:42:27
what was the causation? GDAX and coinbase down and than bitcoin went down?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:53:59
any minutes?
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:41:23
I agree. BTC is commodity and the same rules can apply. However think of one thing - market participants have a very limited access to crucial info + all of them are high risk takers 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:33:47
Estimated Next Difficulty:	938,371,817,281 (-35.41%)
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:03:25
next is 8k again
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:36:47
Fake news? :-)
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:59:18
I would not treat this as repetitive pattern. If suddenly sth triggers the fall, volume may be high and price may go down at the same time
@_date: 2018-02-19 03:31:23
do you really think that one day btc will overcome fiat?
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:40:37
if employees of nuclear facility are so dumb to connect supertopsecret stuff to Internet - we should be worried
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:41:39
this would work if there was only one trading market - nowadays there are numerous of them all over the internet
@_date: 2018-02-19 03:27:09
hmm polish seem to be quiet and slow?
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:57:42
thanks for thorough explanation. Technically speaking how does it work? Are there any rest api interfaces I can use? Which trading website offer such a thing?
@_date: 2018-07-21 01:46:26
the sticker on the doors says "do not enter unless you work here"... so what does this suppose to be?
@_date: 2018-07-21 16:18:26
what if Elon says - Tesla only for bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:30:53
Heard that Canada is getting to launch Bitcoin based ETF... what do you say?
@_date: 2018-02-19 03:48:25
Pole here.
Did you guys watch these videos? No you didn't
To put you in better perspective: over a dozen years ago, lots of Polish people started to take mortgages in foreign currency (interest rates were very low if you consider swiss frank). The risk was high thou. 
Nowadays swiss frank has quadrupled its price!
Ppl started to blame government and banks that no information was given about potential risks. Some of them requested government to help pay out their debts
Those videos supposed to be an informative action to let ppl know about relatively big risk when in comes to investing in crpto.
Slander is NOT a suitable word here. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 02:34:01
2 questions;
- Where exactly it is?
- Why 24h tho? Just in case smb might feel an urge to buy a bitcoin at 4am?
@_date: 2018-04-08 00:05:23
moreover, every transaction has to be documented by filling 3 A4 pages of a document. no, this is not a joke, God bless Polish ppl
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:07:30
I know the reason! I 've just cashed out all my btc assets... That's why
@_date: 2019-05-12 02:17:26
I will let you know guys when I buy in
