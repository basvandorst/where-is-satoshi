I feel compelled to say that OP stated no opinion and just gave us information.
Now that Im here, thanks for your explanation, that part was really helpful. your conclusion, not so much. For a conclusion, you can throw that away, you would get ZERO points for it as a conclusion for your otherwise really good ELI5.

If NK buys, price goes up
I mean, they are not buying $50K, they would put millions in.
@_date: 2019-11-21 13:19:29
ok ok, never get a wallet from a website, yeah, it makes sense.
What happens if I set the Ledger X with "my" 24 words, will that open a new wallet with zero coins in it?
@_date: 2019-11-21 13:21:23
got it, and you did save me. You are totally right.
@_date: 2019-11-30 06:19:32
thanks! I thought so.
@_date: 2019-11-22 10:17:54
That is not all, I just ordered my Ledger X, so expect Kraken to stop working before I take my coins out  :P
@_date: 2019-11-21 13:11:55
Awesome! thanks.
So, you mean that if I make a Brain Wallet here
A Ledger X will not load the wallet (provided I deposit some coins), is that correct?
@_date: 2019-11-21 12:44:09
according to this video
I can buy a Ledger and "load" my 24 word wallet, is that it?
If I loose my Ledger, I can buy another Ledger and recover my same wallet??
So that means I can set a 24 password wallet say, in a website or in any wallet I want, and then load it to the ledger or for that effect, to any other wallet that offers 24 word restore.
Is this correct?
@_date: 2019-11-21 11:22:09
so hard to say "Ledger X is a great option".
thanks for your waste of energy.

hey, "someone" should make a post or a meme that get this to the front page  =)
@_date: 2019-11-22 11:59:35
oh damn... my order is still not dispatched  :P
@_date: 2019-11-21 13:36:20
ok. ok.
Got it.

What/how can the blockchain be regulated?
@_date: 2019-11-24 12:28:23
Following for later
@_date: 2019-11-30 09:17:27
That is over simplified. Then again, how will they steal Bitcoin and how much?  
I can understand NK and any other blocked gov trying to get their hands into the international market and by pass the US controlled monetary system.
We are doing the very same thing.
@_date: 2019-11-21 11:23:32
thanks, I will get the Ledger X
@_date: 2019-11-21 07:31:24
Id like to see not a single entity with more than 1%, that is a distribution Id love to see.
@_date: 2019-11-21 22:14:05
they dont even pay taxes.
@_date: 2019-11-21 12:25:57
can I choose my own 24 words and if yes, is there a video tutorial for that?
@_date: 2019-11-21 07:34:47
and the ELI5 or a tutorial link my friend's mom can understand?  :D
@_date: 2019-11-21 11:23:13
im leaning towards Ledger X.
why is it so hard for people to recommend anything (not you, justothers).
@_date: 2019-11-22 18:37:53
@_date: 2019-11-21 22:10:47
this would look nice in the front page
@_date: 2019-11-21 13:06:51
ok, do I get this right?
1) I can choose my own 24 words [Here as a Brain Wallet](
2) I can send money to this wallet using the Public Key.
3) I can load this Brain Wallet into any Ledger using the same 24 words I used for the Brain Wallet and use the coins with the App.
4) If I ever loose the Ledger, I can buy a new one and load the same Brain Wallet, and it will have the funds.
Is this correct?
@_date: 2019-11-21 12:41:59
that was not my question, save your "I know" energy, you know nothing about what words I want.
Read the question again since it was not clear.
@_date: 2019-11-21 13:30:40
ok, I can use 24 words in a Ledger X, what ever words I want and it will load a wallet as long as the 24 words come from the list shared by another user in another comment  :P
is this working?
@_date: 2019-11-21 07:54:18
Ill pass that along. Like sure, anybody who asks, just google it.
@_date: 2019-11-21 22:13:31
Germans are so conservative, I cant see that happening unless it is in the law, signed by the government.
They jump at the rhythm of the law, and they love reminding everyone who is stepping out of it.
This will never happen in Germany except for a few people maybe.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:40:09
just checked, arriving on Monday, so any mayhem should happen before that  :P
@_date: 2019-11-30 09:15:24
like the US?  when they got BTC-E, they took half my money. Now I have a Ledger.
I know what you mean and you are right hands down, just saying an gov "might" do that in any country.
Which gov is trusted with leaving us in peace?
@_date: 2019-11-21 07:49:09
this is the way to spread Bitcoin! I guess?
With new people who want to join but get bs answers, surely this helps the community.
@_date: 2019-11-22 08:25:20
can anyone point a out a GOOD article about what happen with each halvening up to now?
there are many, I just need a good a short one to understand this thing.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:26:33
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:22:12
Im an idiot, sorry.
I watched this videos (x2 speed)  and I get why. It was just not obvious to me.
sorry again.
@_date: 2019-11-21 12:50:19
thanks! I dont know everything.
words are predefined in a list? then, where can i see that list?

you are a drama queen.
@_date: 2019-10-26 07:47:28
I would have been happy to see Tyrion in the Throne.
fuck that show.
@_date: 2019-10-27 07:14:15
it is already an old show, every body know the end sucks, and i did not said in any way anything about the end beyond the obvious, one of the favorite characters does not "win" the Throne. You still have a lot of them to "enjoy" your series.
You must be a sensitive, very passive aggressive person, can resonate, lol.
@_date: 2019-12-01 02:04:36
it ended too soon!!
@_date: 2019-09-25 01:15:02
Im super happy!! I just bought again.
