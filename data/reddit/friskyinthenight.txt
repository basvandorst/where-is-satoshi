Yeah but that kind of thinking is falacious, you could not possibly have known, and if you went back in time you would make the same decisions every time because that's the best information you had available to you at the time (i.e. no idea of what the price would be in early 2013). 
Hindsight, as they say, is always 20/20.

I like the way you think young man.

My evaluation is via charting but the significant increase in price since Jan, plus the fact we're very close to breaking the big ceiling, leads me to believe that it's currently over-valued, I expect us to break the ceiling then see a correction, even if it's only down to $25. Then continue a longer term trend upwards.

Do you realise how much tea one can actually buy with a bitcoin?

Many thanks!

Yup, great stuff, I'm enjoying the ride!

Take some profit, or at least enough to cover your investment.

Chop chop, over the top at £200 and back in time for tea and crumpets.

I feel like it could be, but I wanted to draw on the greater knowledge of the subreddit combined, I invest outside of bitcoins in commodities and shares but I am still learning, I recognise that it is a gamble and a risk but one I am willing to take.
Really, you can never have enough information when investing, this is just one way of gleaning some more.

No problem, thank you!

We *do*, *do* we?

Almost enough to feed the colonies. Although that is some crazy poop tea. I prefer Earl Grey, or if I'm feeling naughty, a cup of chamomile.

Happy to help! GO GOONERS!

I've been reading this subreddit for a while and here is what we know:
* Bitcoin will reach either a gazillion dollar per coin, or no dollars per coin.
* Invest now, theres's never a perfect time, you could be waiting months/years or it may never drop, that said, it could crash tomorrow, so don't invest anything more than you can afford to lose
Gods speed son.

Ha, there's also a universe where he is overcome by a need to give all of his coins to me. Lovely jubbly.
