Stop pretending you know things.

Normally you would be right. But not with Wozniak. Woz has always been a Tech first guy and has earned his reputation.

Capitalism isn't perfect. Marx and his ideas aren't perfect. The truth, and what is best for all of us is to analyze all viewpoints and improve what we have based on objective reasoning. I disdain your unwarranted disdain.

Most laughably poor analogy I've seen today.

Crypto proponents should be happy about more adoption, not infighting over which coin is used.

You speak as if you have some sort of special knowledge on the subject. Enlighten us about what "human nature" is then.

I see a serious fallacy first off : you are claiming to attribute objective value to the $1 mill that this individual SUBJECTIVELY decided the coffee was worth, thereby pointing out just how futile and unreliable (and subjective) the idea of an objective totem of value (like a dollar) is.  
The mistake is building a philosophy around this single monolithic idea of "value", which of course would naturally get codified into some form of currency or "value" holding totem like that. We should be more concerned with Values, plural. Interestingly enough, the crypto market seems to almost intuitively understand this philosophical concept by having an abundant number of different currencies representing different "values", though that's more of a funny observation than anything.  
As for other systems, all the alternative philosophies have been systematically demonized and stifled for political gain over the past 100 years. All systems are "hybrids", mixes of multiple economic/political system including the one we have now. If you think we live in a textbook "capitalist free market" you are mistaken (you probably know better). 
But if I say any "trigger" words like social...X or communo...X, the discourse will likely shut down. 
There are existing ideas to pull from, none of them perfect of course. I would recommend doing some academic reading on the subject, like this for example : 
Short answer, we would live in a better world if we incorporated more Social and Communal values into of economic/politcal system, while simultaneously rejecting authoritarianism. All the "Socialist" or "Communist" regimes named in history were actually Authoritarian regimes...not true representations of those economic philosophies in any remotely ideal sense. Rejecting ALL the principles of those philosophies is a mistake. Read into that what you will.

For fucks sake people stop screwing around with shit while you are driving, irresponsible selfish pricks.

If he's right, Bitcoin won't matter and noone will care.

"Human nature" as you are using it isn't some common-sense established fact. There's plenty of evidence to suggest the negative/selfish Ayn Rand-esque type bias you are referring to is a complete myth. 
Mutual aid, reciprocity, empathy, self-sacrifice, pair bonding, cooperation, are all also "human nature". 
Even if the negative traits DID outweight the positive...what type of human nature is better to STRIVE to achieve?

That would be tough, considering the Illuminati doesn't exist in any way. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:52:29
What utter nonsense. Might want to get that meglomania checked. Bitcoin could drop to worthless at any time...not likely but don't conflate it with the embodiment of "freedom".

Wow someone drank the koolaid. This is not how things really work and is a way for the rich to feel superior to the poor.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:14:32
This is the type of cancerous philosophy capitalism got us.
@_date: 2019-12-16 01:10:52
It's not really "the state"...more like "the rich".
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:16:37
Then "value" has zero objective meaning, and this is all make-believe bullshit. This is the kind of cancerous philosophy capitalism got us.

It misses the mark though, because how to spend currency is not the issue in Puerto Rico right now at all, access to emergency supplies is. Typically you don't slam down a 20 on the table to receive humanitarian aid, whether it be "backed by gold" or not.
To be clear though, I don't think crypto should replace standard money either...right now. There are clearly some pre-reqs before that can or should happen.
