Seems like a solution in search of a problem. If we go back to the state of Ohio, they won’t actually collect bitcoin. Instead, taxpayers will send their digital currency to BitPay, a payments processor in Atlanta, which will convert the bitcoin into dollars for the state treasurer’s office. The Treasurer’s office will not hold cryptocurrency - this makes me wonder whether selling bitcoin to pay taxes is a taxable event.
