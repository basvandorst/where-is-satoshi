Buying right before it goes live isn't such a great idea. Unless you mean you meant to buy last night, since you'd probably be able to sell this morning at a pretty good gain

Not for that specific figure, but [here]( is an article about the purchasing power that women have.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:03:26
The original source is [here]( in Bloomberg.

I think that’s less likely as things like futures start to take hold, though. Not that I think there’s no reason for concern, but I’m not sure the government shutting it down should be the main worry.

The canary clause has been gone for at least a year I believe
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:51:31
There's an article [here]( 
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:46:38
I wouldn't risk it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:38:20
Oh thanks! Honestly, I am okay with that... It'll be interesting to see if the price keeps shooting up in the meantime, lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:26:08
What happened to the lost ones? Lost keys, etc? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:19:40
I'm using Binance and like it
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:04:23
What do you think it is, then?
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:02:31
People who go all in are more likely to be panicky and sell off at the first sniff of a downturn.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:28:31
Easy interface plus purchases with credit card 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:22:51
If you look at the shit show that happened with the Bcash launch it appears slightly more reasonable 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:50:41
It's fine, it's just a link to Reddit preferences. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:47:30
I think people have been spoiled by the craziness this week 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:24:33
Probably CBOE

Only invest what you can afford to lose, not because you’re making a wild bet that you’ll make money. That’s the way to lose your savings. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:25:35
It's supposed to go live at 9am or has that changed? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:38:19
Let's really hope it doesn't get to 17k! ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:19:01
Yeah it might just work out for you, lol. Either way I think it's best to just sit tight and see how this shakes out. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:33:56
Why not do 75/25. Pull 75% to pay off your loans - there is *nothing* better than being debt free - and leave the remaining 25% in. Don't leave it all in, if it plummets you'll be kicking yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:50:04
Thank you. :| 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:58:45
ha, I did the same thing, decided to spread out some of my BTC to LTC and ETH. Glad that I did tbh!
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:33:24
If they really want to, they can delve into banks getting transfers from exchanges, etc, I imagine
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:49:44
Could be confidence that it's going to keep going up, 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:29:12
Futures is happening on the 18th, maybe that’s what you’re thinking of? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:14:51
It’s probably because with the higher price comes the desire to know that there is sufficient value to justify it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:56:51
Yeah, people were talking about 17 and 18k but on other sites it was only showing 15ish. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:03:28
mods why isn't there a new discussion post for today? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:19:06
If you're scared then honestly, no joke or criticism, take 80% at least and take it out. If you'd be devastated and in trouble if it crashes after futures the you shouldn't have the money in there. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:28:13
Looks like the mods have it private for the moment, archive.org shows it was up earlier today. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:31:54
It's basically when people agree to buy/sell it at a certain price at some point in the future. There's a [101]( here, I'm a bit hazy on it myself so I don't want to try to explain it much more :P 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:11:20
Price for BCH is pushing down on Bitfinex. Seems to be yo-yoing around on Coinsquare. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:31:12
Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:59:46
Yeah, other sites only showed a max of like 15.8. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:58:18
Only invest what you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:20:43
Yeah, I bought in last week at 10 something and this has been an interesting week! 
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:15:26
They've gone private again? They did that over the weekend and had a tag line blaming a different sub. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:23:44
You're not the only one here! :) 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:17:59
Whales are people with a lot of coins/money that can impact the market when they sell/buy
Alternatively, whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:33:28
You could hold off to see what happens after the 10th. However I say that as someone who bought last week and so far doesn't regret it :P It's really up to you. You could start off by getting your feet wet, just make sure that you do not invest more than you are okay losing. Really think about it - if something happens and Bitcoin plunges, are you okay losing that amount for the opportunity? If you are, great. If not, then reconsider your number.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:40:52
Whales are people/entities moving very large amounts that impact the market more than the usual volume does.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:58:03
Wow. Just googled about that and I am so glad that scam hasn’t hit my Facebook feed yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:43:19
Thanks for pointing that out, I hadn’t noticed the username. Wonder if that means that he’s actually hoping to short instead. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:23:44
Post only, they won't go through until 10am PST 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:55:54
Very very bad idea
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:13:21
The activity on here is lower as well. I think people are in a bit of a holding (lol) pattern and waiting to see what happens. Tomorrow is when the action will take place imo. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:19:23
Other sites are showing it at around 15k. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:59:18
Are you Canadian? You can check out other people have posted about having delays as well
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:35:01
The truth is that nobody really knows. I'm pretty new to this but it's clear that the future could go either way, especially with futures coming into the picture. A couple of weeks from now things could look very different in either direction.
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:12:42
Plenty of people over on admit when they’re wrong. And most don’t boast about big green dildos, either. Sounds like you’ve just come across bad traders.
