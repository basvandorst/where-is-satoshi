Speaking of 'investment', what makes you not invest bitcoins in a venture that will yield bigger return in the future? (Putting the risk aside).
And if by that you meant any spending at all, there is time preference. Most people prefer to eat every day, even if they could buy twice much the food for their money next year.
A good example is computer technology. Most national currencies are deflationary when compared to computers. By this logic, noone would ever buy a computer - why spend money now, when in a year you can buy it for half the price?

or: magicaltux wants to play it safe, splits up bitcoins to separate locations, with 32k for immediate access; 1.5k could even be his personal stash to cover for losses -- it is not unthinkable that he would be an early mining adopter

Another possible explanation: someone just deposited funds into mtgox. After shutting down the site, magicaltux secured these new funds manually into the new wallet
My theory: I believe the hacker compromised a random account, added arbitrary number of bitcoins (500k) to this account through SQL injection, and them sold them off. If this is true, the goal was probably just crashing the market - the hacker could easily just make multiple accounts with fake BTC balances and then withdraw them...

How do you link  to 
EDIT: Ok I see it now

Ok, I missed that in the timeline. It still may be a coincidence..
Or maybe Satoshi got pissed and is making a statement on centralization ;)

A simple explanation could be that he split up the coins for safety after hack (should do so way before imho), and then manually consolidated the bitcoins that came in after he shut down the site.
