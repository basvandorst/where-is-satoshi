Everywhere.  Just you need to educate a buyer and a seller. To let them know that if they exchange crypto, they exchange real value. In my country there are many such places and there is a map online with many shops online around the globe \([ In a poor country they still have internet and they have mobile phones. They just need to use that for this purpose. Nothing avoids anybody to buy 2 apples for a fraction of any coin and then buy an egg for what they got.

If you talk about "near future" I agree \- they need to get information and tools. Anyway, these people do not have credit cards, debit cards or bank accounts and they may never get these. Still they already have opportunity in crypto sphere and they can do transactions. AManInBlack2017 bellow this comment says these people do not need it. Wrong, according to me. Many of such individuals, for example, work far from their home, maybe abroad. To send money to families is terrible task then. Just teaching those communities how things work is enough \- a son will send his parents some crypto, they will go marketplace and if there is one seller accepting it, someone was helped. In some cases it already works. Just more awareness is necessary about this.

" Withdrawals will remain enabled at the daily **withdrawal limits** prior to the deadline. " \- Just for the record: As I have heard from a friend: since NOW some folks who have forgot a few bucks there on legacy accounts have their withdrawal **limit set to 0**. That is a joke... Poloniex announced mandatory verification long ago, yes. But they probably did NOT inform legacy users about planned changes in withdrawal limits. They just promissed that withdrawals will be possible after that date \(unknown in advance\). I am not a lawyer but when there are no more "generous" limits \- it all looks to me like unacceptable pressure put on anonymous traders. To get funds back they must go through verification. New terms of use were applied without the option for legacy users to withdraw. Correct? Any lawyer here who would like to comment? Looks pretty shady to me.

Yeah, also hardware wallet Trezor is from Czech Republic, a lot of things started there and recently they announced that Generalbytes introduced a new servis allowing to purchase bitcoin in many Prague subway stations. Alza retailer accepts litecoins and people order from abroad. The number of purchases is rising. Progressing adoption in the center of Europe, another crypto\-friendly country is Switzerland ...

Cryptocurrency may help the poor. If you learn the situation in Venezuela, e.g., you will see how much and you can try. It really does not matter how much the price is and if so, the higher the price, the better. You can help directly to a particular person who is living for 2 USD in Venezuela e.g. The citizen there have just learnt how they can profit from it. Your 100 bucks in USD will be a lot \- always. Let's say you send litecoin. If the price of litecoin is 350 tomorrow, the person will have 100 bucks. If the price will drop the next day to 100 they will have 28 USD only. But if the price is 5000 USD the chances it will drop to 1400 next day are much smaller. We expect lower volatility coming with adoption. Even if it drops \-350, to 4650, the poor person you donated to still can buy groceries for 93 USD. There are wealthy nations and other, not so lucky. But all can profit from cryptocurrency, it helps everyone.  There may come time almost nobody will be able to purchase a whole coin, but who cares \- we can always use fractions.

Yes. 1. People prefer to accumulate now, not to spend 2. We still miss easy to understand interfaces, applications for not technically oriented people. 3. 60&amp; of Americans Have Heard of Bitcoin, 5&amp; Own and you can imagine how small number of people heard of this option in the poorest regions of the world.

We should be worried, yes,  and we should focus on DEXes, definitely. With no keys you have nothing. But DEXes need to provide better user experience soon, to attract crowds and some reasonable volume. Try ABRA
