Hi Luke,
Regarding post frequency, I'm trying to strike a good balance between daily posts which some people demand, and occasional posts which seem to be more reasonable, and stopping posting alltogether. I don't mean to spam and try to add new unique content to every post.
My primary motivation is to see the mempool cleared so that zero fee transactions can be processed again. I'm curious, do you think that's a good goal?
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:51:34
I would agree in the long-term a fee market would be a great incentive.
With BTC trading over $10K each and the supply inflating at 4% per year, do you think there's more than enough incentive for miners at this time?

At this point I probably won't feel good about Coinbase again unless they were to drastically change course, replace the CEO, roll out SegWit/Batching, and lead the way to be the first exchange to implement Lightning Network in 2018.

When I make daily posts I've noticed they get several comments along the line of "stop spamming", "please stop posting this", etc. I also get several PM's from Cash'ers telling me how obsolete Bitcoin is, etc and how I'm wasting my time/energy. My impression is that there is a group of people that really really don't want to see SegWit use rise and they would like to discourage/prevent me from carrying on with the posts. 
My original post took several hours to research/write and I typically spend at least a couple hours on every new post adding news, expanding content, and proofreading. Not just a simple copy/paste/submit. After asking you nicely not to copy/paste/submit on my behalf, your actions lead me to conclude either of the two scenarios are likely taking place:
1. You are probably a dumb kid whose heart is in the right place but you're classlessly taking it upon yourself to re-post without DM'ing me and telling me essentially to f-off when I ask you to back off. 
2. You are anti-bitcoin and you are doing your best to disrupt the flow of my posts. Your account history makes it look like you bought the account since it just started posting in out of the blue, and instead of submitting unique content that you find yourself you copy/submit my post so that I can't.

I've read that SegWit implementation for exchanges is not trivial, but there are reports of it only taking a few days. If users start actually discriminating against non-SegWit exchanges and it leads to profit margins being impacted, perhaps most will be motivated to deploy it within a few weeks. Hopefully it snowballs to 50%+ SegWit tx's soon after that and the mempool will stay clear for at least 6-months.
My impression is that many key players are dragging their feet on this for some reason, and it's time to hold their feet to the fire.

When I found out Bitcoin would inflate for a few years and then become a currency with little/no inflation it sent my mind racing and I knew I had to become a part of it. I want a world where governments can't prey on their citizens by inflating their currencies or I want $0 per bitcoin. Fuck any price in-between. Ownership in BTC is a vote to take away government power to inflate. That power will be taken non-violently without an election, revolution or war, and will benefit humans everywhere. Get as many votes in for that as you can and HODL. All prices in-between here and BTC as world reserve currency are irrelevant.

Futures for the first time allows organizations like Apple to purchase large amounts of BTC and hedge the price volatility for a small fee.
With a large supply of BTC onhand, Apple can offer its users the ability to transact from/to BTC with the majority of transactions performed off chain. 
Currently Apple Pay is far more convenient than doing an on-chain transaction with any cryptocurrency. Apple could charge less than credit cards to benefit merchants, enable BTC hodlers to easily transact in BTC, and all while making a nice profit for now for themselves.
If Apple want to let its users transact in BTC, it's going to need to buy a lot of bitcoins...
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:11:14
Exchanges should also batch sent transactions for a huge decrease in fees and help reduce demand on the blockchain.
An extra move would be for the major exchanges to set up payment channels with each other so that inter-exchange transactions could be kept off-chain. There's no need for hundreds/thousands (?) of transactions per day between Kraken/Coinbase. Just settle up once a day.

Futures are an option to hedge the risk.
Even more affordable though would be for exchanges to simply have an agreement between each other to settle their bitcoin whenever a certain amount is owed on net or a certain time has passed, possibly using a 3rd party escrow service to reduce the counterparty risk.
For example, to reduce all tx's between Kraken and Coinbase to 3 tx's per 24 hours:
1. Coinbase and Kraken would each deposit 500 btc into escrow (2 tx's)
2. Throughout the day a record of transfers between exchanges would be created, no BTC would be transferred, but BTC would be instantly credited at the receiving exchange
3. At the end of the day, the difference between transactions sent would be calculated, the escrow balance would be adjusted appropriately, and BTC would be released from escrow back to each exchange. (1 tx, multiple outputs)
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:56:47
If you have less than $50 btc in an address (I have a few of those), here's your gameplan:
1. Get Segwit adopted by a base level of users
2. Segwit users will demand their exchanges/wallets support Segwit or they will walk
3. Contact your exchange/wallet provider an politely ask them to upgrade to Segwit asap
4. After enough users/exchanges/wallets switch to Segwit, transaction capacity will rise above daily demand, and fees will plummet and possibly go back to near zero
5. You can move your coins.

Hypothetical 100% Segwit:
- 7200 transactions per block (double non-segwit)
- max 1,036,800 transactions per day

100% Segwit would increase the transactions per second. If a few hours or a couple of days enough time would pass to clear the current mempool. At that point, there would be spare room in future blocks and it would be possible to again include transactions with very low/no fees, similar to what it possible with Bitcoin Cash right now.
People will start doing more transactions and eventually, we'll be back to where we are now, but Segwit could delay that until Lightening is ready. Imo, lets try it.

I see that as the potential beginning of the stampede and I suspect Paypal, Apple Pay, Amazon, et al are all working in the background to integrate soon. BTC can't handle transactions on chain at the moment so there is a huge opportunity for existing actors to fill the void and make it easy for everyone to hold their wealth in BTC while creating a bridge to existing transaction systems.

Hi Borax, thanks for copying/submitting yesterday's post, but I've already spent a couple of hours re-writing todays post. Could you delete this one so I can post it? I created the original post and have been adding a few hours of work to each one.

LTC is having a pump cycle right now, possibly set off by the exchange issue at Bitfinex over the weekend. Users couldn't withdraw BTC or ETH so started converting to LTC. LTC's all-time high is 0.048 BTC. Today's rally brings it back up to 0.012BTC
ETH's all-time high is 0.156BTC and it's at 0.029BTC. It seems unlikely that it will ever go back. 
When I analyze what's going on I list out [the 7 network effects]( and grade each coin. Bitcoin is ahead in most/all and overwhelmingly has the strongest brand. Until that changes, I'm going to keep 100% of my core holding in BTC and avoid the alts. With all the futures/etf's coming online I suspect we're most likely heading back to 80-90% BTC dominance.
Regarding Coinbase adding lots of new alts in 2018, if I had to guess I'd say it will probably result in all kinds of pumps, a few millionaires will be made, and then BTC will slaughter everyone. A lot of people will get hurt. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:46:16
Bitcoin is now so far above the 200dma that it can be considered in the "slightly overvalued" territory. Best case scenario is we fix that by going sideways for a few weeks while the 200dma catches up. Then we can perhaps sustainably go to $100K per bitcoin without any major pullback.

Interactive chart: 
Seven network effects of digital currency: 
Futures now enable large entities to transact &amp; settle in BTC. Apple Pay integration coming soon to keep small transactions off chain but allow transaction in bitcoin currency? Amazon/Walmart to accept BTC from all customers and BTC payment to everyone in their global supply chains?
What a time to be alive
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:27:54
Competition will regulate their behavior. Imo AppleCoin, CryptoRubble, USGov't coin, etc don't have a chance. The combined Bitcoin network effect is likely way to big to overcome.
Square is already adding BTC integration. If not ApplePay, then Paypal, Google, etc could do it. A Facebook could get in the game and allow sending BTC via messenger/Whatsapp message. 2018 could be huge for the types of features we'll see.
The Bitcoin blockchain can't yet handle microtransactions like that. I don't see a problem with using private ledgers for now to make it possible.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:10:21
Is this theoretically possible?
1. Multiple bitcoin users temporarily entrust their private keys to a trusted custodian
2. A collection of many keys are batched into one transaction with multiple inputs and sent to a segwit address
3. One transaction sends all bitcoin back to multiple outputs belonging to each original bitcoin user

The entire push behind Bitcoin Cash is to be able to spend BTC on coffees again. People would love that.

- A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.
- A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction.

Tx fees and times will be solved within bitcoin in time. But what if they never were and things stay just as they are now?
I'm not so sure bitcoin would die even in that scenario. Now that we have futures markets, companies like Paypal, ApplePay, Amazon, etc can purchase large amounts of BTC, hedge the price risk, and setup their own off-chain ledgers for all small transactions...making them instant, free, and convenient to make with existing infrastructure. In that scenario, the BTC blockchain would still be the store of value/reference chain, and everyone could conduct all their affairs in BTC.
Square has already announced they're doing just that. I suspect the others are already working on it and will announce soon. Alt coin holders should be prepared for the potential of 90% BTC dominance returning soon. It's already back to 55%:

Gemini will register Canadians and have relatively low fees compared to Quadriga &amp; Coinbase. If you can wire US$, they might be the best choice.
If you want to hold crypto in your retirement RRSP or tax-free TFSA, buy COINXBT shares. How-to: 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:30:16
I expect it will only take a relatively small percentage of Bitcoin users to switch to Segwit and demand exchanges/wallets support it until we hit a tipping point where it will become easy for everyone to use. We'll see a rapid s-curve adoption of Segwit. I suspect the community is big enough to push us to that tipping point.

Entities can now take large positions in BTC and hedge them with futures. 
[I could see Square, Apple, Paypal, Amazon, Walmart, et al buy up tens, or hundreds of thousands of BTC now]( to hold as inventory for their operations.

Imagine Apple/Google partners with Coinbase and/or the other large exchanges and let you link your mobile payments to your bitcoin exchange balance. Once that's in place, Apple/Coinbase can take care of the ledger activities on their backends for trillions of small transactions without needing to actually make many transactions on chain. Easy accessibility to futures makes it really easy.  
As the whole system takes off, more and more merchants will likely see the advantage of staying in BTC instead of fiat and they could be given that option as all down the supply chain BTC will become the  valued currency. 
In the end we all have quick/convenient transactions with the option of keeping them on/off chain, and all commerce will have the option to settle in BTC. This may be how BTC gets to world reserve currency status.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:16:49
The settlement between brokers would be once a day, the BTC could be credited via the payment channel instantly for free
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:53:09
If your BTC is in storage and you're happy with your wallet provider, it won't help to move it. If you're planning to transact, get to a Segwit address/wallet.

First rule: HODL
Second rule: HODL
Once enough time has passed, bitcoin will stabilize at an equilibrium price and stop going up. At that point it's fixed supply will cause it to grow only at about the typical growth rate of world GDP. Following the combination of rules 1 &amp; 2 up to that point will have resulted in having large amounts of the worlds wealth transferred to you, and you can then take possession of large amounts of land, companies, lambos, or whatever you wish.

What was the fee on one of those trades through TD?
I've been calling around a few different brokerages this morning. The majority advised that they do not offer purchasing shares on exchanges outside of US/Canada
- Interactive Brokers (restriction applies to RRSP/TFSA only)
- Royal Bank
- Credential Direct
- HSBC (has access to almost every exchange other than Stockholm)
- Qtrade
- Virtual Brokers
- Questrade
Others that do offer foreign exchange access:
- National Bank $75 per trade + $0.06 per share
- TD: $187-$235 per trade
- ~~Questrade: Should be possible, but must be over the phone at $195 minimum fee or 1% of total~~
- CIBC: $250 minimum, ticker: BITCOIN.XBT
- Scotia iTrade: $250 per trade
- BMO Investorline: Probably $150+. If there had been an OTC tracking COINXBT they would give the web trading rate of $9.95
