Let me explain how this works. Let's say the price is 8000$ at the moment. That's the price of last transaction.
There are people selling different amounts of BTC for different amounts, let's say:
* Frank has placed an order to sell 50 BTC for 8100$ each, 
* Annie has placed an order to sell 40 BTC for 8250$ each
* Debbie has placed an order to sell 10 BTC for 8400$ each
There are also many more listings, but for higher prices.
Now I want to buy 100 BTC, doesn't matter how much $ it takes. I place order - buy me 100 BTC NOW!
I buy all of BTC listed by Frank, Annie and Debbie. 100 BTC total. Highest amount I paid for single one is 8400$. That's how you get a 400$ spike. There's nothing to be suspicious about, it's just how trading works.

Pole here. He is a known idiot on the polish youtube scene. He mostly does fake/staged pranks for little kids, running around the city naked etc. To be honest I am amazed he was paid that much.

It's a combination of so many factors that it's hard to describe. Big events in Asia, people panic selling, talks about banning crypto in country X, tether drama, corrections etc.

Good luck timing the market. It might go up the moment someone sells and never go back.

He was "teary-eyed". It's in the title.
