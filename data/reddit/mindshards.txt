Lovely line of reasoning.

How is that a good thing? It strikes me as pretty weird.

Thanks for the clarification. I'm asking for the opensource thing because your software is holding my money. Being closed source means I need to trust you, and that's a big step (for me).

Are the private keys stored in the app or your servers? If the former: is the app open source?

I was under the impression everybody knew this about Bitcoin core.

Have a look at [BTCD]( if you're interested in tests. It's build to exactly mimic Bitcoin core (bugs and all) and has great test coverage. Presumably you could port these at least on the integration level.

Much of the used libraries used are open source: [
The app itself is slanted to be open source. Timeline depending on some bureaucracy.

I'm having this issue again. Just wait 3 days and try again? I'd better use a bank then.

Not to my knowledge but it's open source and on [Github](
@_date: 2015-09-22 08:40:23
That's to be determined, with the code on Github.

My bad, you're entirely right. I was too quick to hit 'save'. Monetas no longer sponsors OT development.

He left Monetas, the corporate sponsor of OT. He's still with OT.

I did look, and although I haven't wrapped my head around it completely, I still don't see the point. It's nice and all that it's all on the blockchain but it also feels it's (ab)using the blockchain in a weird/innovative way.

Negotiation shared secrets seem like a solved problem (DH). Why does BIP47 go into this whole [Notification Transaction]( business?
Just for the sake of a-synchronicity?

I especially like the email address in the header of the paper: "lastname

I curious about the source. Is it released somewhere?
