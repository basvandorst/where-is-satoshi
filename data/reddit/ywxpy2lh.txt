That subreddit has always been an ignorant, leftist, shithole.  It's never been a place to go for anyone interested in technology.  It was bad from its inception.  I've never figured out why; it seems worse than most subreddits generally.

What kind of business ends their most distinctive offering without announcing it? That is super sketchy.
Thank God I stayed with Bitpay for sales, I was about to switch my business over. 
I recommended Coinbase to someone just this morning, and now I look like an asshole. Never again. Ugh.

In principle it's the same argument as saying a free market "wastes" resources by having more than one provider for anything (e.g. competition). And equally wrong as that argument, by ignoring the bigger picture.

I'm here because it's the simplest way to be notified of major events. And yes.

Their site gets a little slow when gox goes down, but it usually can be made to work with a few tries (good enough for transfers but not good for daytrading).

Either that, or when it's impossible, people suffering or dying.

r/bitcoin is an obvious backwater in the Bitcoin community. People here are delusional because it's part of Reddit, and Reddit in general is full of users who are delusional about its importance.

And not because of any phony fiat money, but because I'm enlightened by my own bitcoins.

Deleted comment was:


Why on earth would you keep your anonymous cryptocurrency in someone else's wallet. I still don't understand why anyone would use third party wallets with anything more than a few dollars worth of coin
My reply: Bitcoin is not anonymous.

From reality (via senses + reason). Do they do what they say they're going to do, do I get the same results they do, and so on. Reality is a very trustworthy source.


Whether they appear to be rational. This seems like a silly question, saying you can't distinguish between quality of different groups of scientists.


No, what would reach the front page would be popular opinions among them, only opinions which were already agreed upon by a majority. Just like now. That's how it works.

I participate because I like discussion.  I counter someone's claim (arbitrary or not) and then support my position. Having a good discussion is interesting, even though I don't learn anything about the subject at hand. 
I wasn't thinking of Reddit as compared to something else.  I just see it as a system that enables great *subjective* discussions.  I do appreciate that misinformation can be corrected here.  There is some small amount of non-subjective knowledge on Reddit.
It's inferior to things like newspapers, lectures, and journals because the discussion is directed democratically, and because participants lack reputation. Reputation is what gives credibility to a source.  If a good journal says something, I can believe it.  If a random person - upvoted democratically by Reddit users - says something, it's not reputable.  I think everyone senses this problem with Reddit.

Yes.  Send it to notify me next time Bitcoin crashes.

You are such an asshole.

Comments don't indicate that there's useful controversy.  That's exactly one way that they're misleading.  If you saw a comment denying the moon landing, would you assume there was a useful controversy to look into?
If no one had said anything, you wouldn't have been aware of a 'controversy' about salt iodine.  Now you think you know something about a debate because you heard two random opinions. 
I'm sure fans of subjective knowledge love it here.

The distinction I'm making is between believing what a group tells you because you trust the specific people in that group, versus believing what a group tells you because it's a consensus. 
I think I see what you mean. Our disconnect is probably having different definitions of 'subjective'. Like:


I'm splitting up that "subjective opinions" category into 1) opinions given to us by a group versus 2) opinions given to us by a group whose members we have judged as reputable/trustworthy.  I'm saying that  is subjective knowledge, while  is not (or less so). 
I just don't want anyone to run a worldwide vote on whether there are multiple universes and have the answer treated as knowledge. Edit: However, if a group of scientists who I considered reputable took a vote on it, I would consider it.
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:52:13
My comment provides no more knowledge than Vycid's does.  I don't prove anything with mine, I didn't even bother to cite it.  You gained zero knowledge about iodine by reading my comment, except that there exists another possibly made-up opinion.  
The only way to get this knowledge is to look it up in reputable sources.   You can't get it from Reddit.  All you get from Reddit is a biased selection of unusable opinions. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:19:37
"Useful controversy" meaning, a controversy that's not arbitrary.  This comes down to arbitrary claims being invalid as knowledge.  A claim in a comment can just be an arbitrary claim.
I mentioned subjective knowledge because many people do believe knowledge is subjective, so it makes sense to me that you might.  
We can discuss knowledge if you like.  It sounds like your view is that knowledge must be subjective either because of the information we get, or the way we infer it?  I define objective knowledge as the result of applying reason to information from our senses.

Oh, maybe it's just me :) It's happened a few times during big trade events.

This is the part where they're delusional. No Dwolla, you don't have the potential to become the world's new currency.

You view reputation as subjective. I view reputation as *my judgment* of someone's character, or of the character of the people judging someone's character for me.  The journal process you described actually involves people's judgments of the specific characters involved at each step of the process.  
Taking a democratic consensus as worthwhile, like the public's opinion on a journal, or r/aww's view on cuteness, would provide subjective results, which is inefficient because of its potential to be inaccurate (- it's invalid as knowledge).
Democratic rating is useful for quickly summing up common knowledge, like what is cute. It's worthless for determining what knowledge is valid.
Edit in response to edit: Democracy can't be objective, by my definition of objective, because democracy isn't the result of reason applied to information from the senses. There's a big difference between conclusions arrived at that way, from conclusions arrived at by taking others' opinions.

God damn it. Stop spreading misinformation. Start by not talking about something you're ignorant of. A 5-minute internet search could find you the right information in this case.
No, the iodine in salt is **not enough** to matter in preventing any harm from radiation. Look at the doses they use for the iodine saturation method you mention, compared to how much is in salt.  The amount is salt is based on the nutritionally minimum amount needed not to become diseased long-term. 
Fuck you so much for daring to spread misinformation in a subthread about spreading misinformation. This is evidence of why Reddit is worthless for anything besides entertainment.
