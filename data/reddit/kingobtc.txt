You can use BitKup and can read about it in the article above

You should try using Localbitcoins to convert your Paypal to Bitcoin. It will be relatively risk free because you are trading with another person. Also you can try VirWox.
For a detailed tutorial on how to convert paypal to bitcoin try this link:

tried downloading gems from the app store on my iphone and couldn't find it... how do I even download the app?

I am comparing it to criaglist because people meet each other without any middlemen except they use cash instead of Bitcoin.

nice video! we made an article back in the day on how to convert paypal to bitcoin and we will be adding your video there! Thanks.

Here is an article about the issues you are facing. Hope Cryptsy resolves this matter ASAP
@_date: 2014-11-18 02:20:34
The article was focused on the BTC/USD trade pairs. Not focusing on any ways of depositing or withdrawing USD. BTC-E won because it has the lowest relative fees with decent security AND most importantly anonymity
@_date: 2014-11-25 02:04:34
thanks! fixed
@_date: 2014-11-25 01:54:36
They definitely earned it. Don't mess with the bitcoin community...
@_date: 2014-06-22 11:31:19
thanks for the comment, I will update this in the article.
@_date: 2014-12-30 14:26:25
so short lived :(
@_date: 2014-07-03 14:18:56
cant believe they dont accept it for actual flights but only for hotels...
@_date: 2014-12-09 10:37:33
exactly, there are so many fishy inconsistencies across the company combined with the bold claims made by the CEO it really does not look good.
@_date: 2014-12-01 10:02:17
awesome idea, wrote an article about it. Good luck with development!
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:48:19
Yea if im such a spammer why does this post have 17 points? Calm down. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 02:23:53
a mainstream news site is bound to write about it if we keep pushing it.

I am from BTCFEED and we wrote an article why GAW miners is a scam: 
We are not owned by GAW or any other company and are 100% independant, no ads on our site and nobody pays us to promote anything.
@_date: 2014-12-01 08:26:49
protesting won't accomplish anything, we must do things our way and leave the opposing party no choice but to follow.
@_date: 2014-06-22 12:39:21
got it! I revised it again
@_date: 2014-11-25 04:06:50
There is another article. I made a post with it but I guess reddit decided to take it down because 
"I'm afraid that this post doesn't differentiate itself enough from the other ones on the front page for us to keep it around. Sorry!"
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:17:55
they better stop these guys form patenting bitcoin, too bad some already got patents
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:57:50
Submitting my article once every couple days from my "shitty blog" is not spamming. You think its spamming go and report me and stop hating on my blog. Atleast I am helping the community by reviewing companies and spreading news. All you are doing is hating. Go back to your toronto subreddit and keep accumulating your points with your awesome posts like you have for the past 6 years. I will just "spam" my blog posts and make more money than you. Im done here.

2014 ended with still more than 70% of people unaware about bitcoin and its uses. Lets hope 2015 will bring that number down!

This is the same comment that was posted on the youtube video:
This is exactly what smart contracts are all about. These are features that are going to appear in Bitcoin 2.0. All of these features were available on Satoshi's first version of the Bitcoin code, but they contained so many bugs that they had to be removed. Hopefully smart contracts will be integrated soon and we can start to see the full advantage of Bitcoin!

It's still an attack because Bitstamp ends up loosing the customer's funds.
@_date: 2015-01-02 04:10:00
