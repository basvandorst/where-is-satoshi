What are they trying to say with that video? I honestly didn't grasp it after one viewing. It almost felt like an inverse image of my social views so I couldn't make sense of it?
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:10:47
Thanks for sharing. The explanation of how everyone was dumbfounded during the flash crash was the closest I have felt to a singularity - we made this thing and it's incredibly complex beyond any human or group of humans to understand fully - and it's doing something we didn't expect... Oh, and we programmed it to be ruthlessly manipulative and selfish.
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:57:24
Ok yeah that's what I was worried it was saying. Like I said - it was like looking at a negative of a photo - it's hard to interpret it. So depressing the number of votes on that video. Thank you for explaining it.

I watched "The Story of Your Enslavement" and while I agree with the general concept of class problems and some people trying to own the world, I was unconvinced of the world view put forward.
I think it greatly oversimplifies the complexity of human society with stated clear lines between owners and slaves without any means of identifying owners vs. slaves. I don't know how to draw that line. On the other hand, name any human on earth who has an enormous amount of power and I can probably name someone or someones who balance that. In other words, I think it is relatively easy to falsify the perfect separation of owners and slaves. Once it is not perfect, the narrative kind of falls apart and becomes shades of gray.
I also listed up some inaccuracies that seem pretty fundamental to the whole proposition:


I don't think we can really draw a bright line between humans and other animals. We are just different in certain ways that turned out to have a huge (for the moment) effect our competitive standing with other creatures. Fear of death is not a fundamental part of those differences - if anything it's a subset of the ability to make long term plans. On the other hand, fear, or rather avoidance, of death is a (nearly?) universal feature baked into life by evolution.


A dog that has been abused will become compliant (or perhaps some other reaction) when it perceives abuse to be imminent. I think it's a point made moot anyway by the reasoning above.
Also [here]( is the first research result I found about animal planning ability although I haven't looked into it.


I can agree with that - slavery in all its forms is a shitty and powerful tool.


I think this is a serious oversimplification of human society, the most complex system that has ever existed on Earth. As I suggested above, I guess the majority of people on earth have relative influence over some people and are relatively controlled by others. The most I would agree with this point is that the distribution of influence is very skewed. I hope we can shift that distribution.


This seems wrong on so many levels although I don't have the historical background to refute it. I seem to remember reading many times that the image of the brutally suppressed slaves building the pyramids is not even correct. 
I will counter this unsupported claim with another claim - humans have not changed all that much in just 3000 years. Our societies have been building up since long before that and we have been using all kinds of coercion available to us today for roughly the same amount of time. I see no reason to think that the concept of giving limited freedom to improve the productivity of those you control is a new idea. Only the scale has changed.
Overall it seems to suggest that we have to first perceive the injustice around us. That seems like an excellent step to me. But then to walk away from it? What does that even mean? Based on all examples that I have read, walking away from society either results in death or a new society. So getting to a new society from the one we have? I can get behind that as we already agreed.
What steps do you perceive to be the best chance even if it's mostly hopeless? On the basic income side, how do you think it will be corrupted? If we can predict that well, then we can continue the social arms race to get as good a result as possible.

I wish I knew enough to convince you that you are wrong. I can only hope that we are able to remove enough unfairness and manipulation from the world in time to avoid it. My best hope is a universal basic income catching on in the right places.
What hope do you see for avoiding it, even if it seems far fetched?
@_date: 2015-06-26 17:12:15
That's interesting. I've been wrong many times in the past and look forward to learning something that might change my worldview.
If you think this kind of intense hatred is manufactured, then the solution would be removing the power of those who manufacture the hate, no? I am not wedded to basic income but I see it as a step toward reducing desperation on a large scale and thus reducing the appeal of radical ideologies that prey on it.
I most worry about how the ideal of a basic income will be corrupted as it comes into practice.
What is your take?

I was in agreement with OP but this changed my view. This is the best stance for newcomers.
- Mine without any new hardware investment to see how it works.
- Expect to make a net loss considering even just the cost of power.
- Buy bitcoin for commerce and or investment

You two are probably in very different financial situations. Of course doesn't * know * it will be a long term success but must have some disposable income to invest in it. Or believes that their fiat is more risky than the bitcoin alternative. Who knows.
As for you, what you are missing is a real social system that doesn't leave its people in constant fear of falling through the cracks.

Virtually all of those people are [highly educated]( if not highly intelligent. It beggars belief to think that at the very least the 168 lawyers among them do not realize what a tangled and unsustainable mess the laws have become.
Creating new laws that benefit someone directly, in the best case their constituents, is probably seen as a much more realistic investment of political capital, time and money. How many people care about massive and far reaching structural reform? Who would vote for you even if you accomplished it? It's a [tragedy of the commons]( with heroes being [outbid by the powerful](

I think you are absolutely right for the average end user but the point is in the long term, will that be the case? Have you seen governments raid pension funds before? I don't know the background of those but I think it is fundamentally mass theft from the average person. The more desperate a government gets, the further it is willing to go to survive. E.g. draconian laws that form a dragnet for increasing government/department "income".
[From &gt; Hold dollars and you must always trust a large group of regulators, politicians, and bankers who do not and cannot have your best interests at heart.

Thank you! I haven't listened to that one yet. These inside recordings are amazing evidence to have when you find someone that doesn't believe people would do bad things at high levels.

It seems to show who has a stronger hold on the reigns doesn't it?

I assume this is a common conspiracy theory? Seems entirely plausible looking from the outside (i havent read all the original dev discussions, threads, etc). 
@_date: 2015-05-03 01:01:24
Even more unfortunately, I am confident the majority of them absolutely do get it. It's just not in their interest to do the right thing.
@_date: 2015-05-03 05:17:24
Agreed depending on where you live. In some places it's a much better store of value than the local fiat and potentially more secure than needing to keep, much less transport black market foreign currency, jewelry or whatever.

Of course it would be an analytical game of cat and mouse but i guess that is par for course for spooks.

That actually sounds like pretty low hanging fruit since diff and analysis could be entirely automated and the simplest version requires no shady access to data streams. In fact i would bet a few bits that at least one researcher or google employee has done it and published the basic form of it.

I haven't considered if or how exactly it could be done with bitcoin, but it's definitely been done before. Check out [Embrace, Extend, Extinguish]( as famously practiced by Microsoft to kill standards.

It says "Seems to be an Asian supermarket in London."
I wish they had added "owned by a Chinese family" but alas nothing is perfect.
@_date: 2015-04-06 14:16:07
Would it be incorrect to say it's a Chinese supermarket owned by an Asian family?
