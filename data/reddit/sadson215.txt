Well FUCK YOU! For supporting that piece of shit bank.  Took me 2 fucking god damn years to get my dead mother's money out of that piece of fucking shit.  You call corporate they tell you call the branch.  Those lazy fucks act like they are working at a min wage job.  
Couldn't get anyone on the fucking phone for months.  Finally went into the office (it's 500 miles away)
Fucking first bitch went on maternity leave without telling anyone about my case.   So I'm sitting there calling with my thumb up my ass for a straight 2 months no calls back.  I have to go back there again.  Get a new bitch... then the "no calls" no response to emails no fucking nothing I get the manager involved I complain to corporate.  2 years and 10 trips later finally get the estate closed.
OMFG I HATE THAT GOD DAMN BANK

Umm.. yeah .. I started buying BTC at 60 ... so yeah I don't care.  
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:48:36
Yeah even if it is just fiat seeing a few hundred thousand dollars go bye bye hurts.  Still got all my bitcoin though and that's what matters.

The only money i've lost over the years is when I sold bitcoin.  Yeah never doing that shit again.

Didn't I explain I still had to do a lot of legal things in Canada too.  I had to go to a notary and have another one do the will search. This was in addition to the US documentation.
This wasn't the problem ...  They weren't doing their job.  The first woman didn't answer the phone.  Then she went on maternity leave without handing off my case to the new person.   The new person did the same thing.  
When someone comes in with a death certificate, probate papers, multiple forms of ID, and you can verify most of it online.    You can at least call them back.  It's entirely unprofessional and inexcusable.  
I'm frustrated with you because you're making excuses for them.  It's fine you're only getting my side of the story, but I did get several apologies from them in the end when things finally were settled.

I'm out of the country in the US.  I did apply for probate with my lawyer here in the states.  I presented all of this shit to the bank multiple god damn times.  
Like what the fuck is wrong with you to assume I'm a dumb fuck.  I went to a canadian notary I had the canadian will search done etc etc. etc.  
I was calling and leaving messages relentlessly.  Corp told me to contact the branch because they controlled the account.  They worked with corp on the backend eventually but what the fuck in the US i had the shit done in a few months.  2 years... 2 fucking years.  
this was a complete systemic failure.  That bitch left without passing my file on to the new person.  They never answer their phones or return emails.  You might get 1 or 2 if it's after you visit them in the office. Completely unprofessional.  They even fucked up on the conversion and finding all of the accounts.

I used bitaddress.org transfering it to a paper wallet ... I used electrum to execute the transaction.
