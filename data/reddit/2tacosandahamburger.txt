It would be great news but fees are 3.75%. Too much in my opinion.
@_date: 2016-04-22 00:54:22
Steam summer sale will be oh so sweet :)
@_date: 2016-04-20 17:19:48
So if this is implemented, to the moon?
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:05:03
What a waste of time that was. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:15:23
Not sure this has anything to do with investing recklessly, sounds like you didn't even use any of your own money. Just sounds like an unfortunate incident. Sorry to hear you are out that much though, don't fret on it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:48:51
Coming from a graphic design background I would change the color red to be associated with negative comments. And then instead of blue for positive I would change it to green.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:51:03
Well shit. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:17:49
Awesome!! I would love to test this out. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 18:11:56
So its even more than 3.75%...
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:11:40
Let's go!!!
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:54:58
So the Bitcoin Core wallet will support SegWit within the next five months. Awesome news.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:16:04
Isn't this good news?
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:49:43
Ah that's a bummer. But yeah man happy to give my feedback, this is a cool tool! I've bookmarked it :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:30:06
Well you heard it here first folks. Close the thread we have our answer.
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:16:18
Great response, he clearly knows Warren Buffett is out of his element when it comes to talking about crypto currency tech. The man doesn't have a clue how all this shit works and how revolutionary it is. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:51:14
Lightning will be deployed over the next year or two. Lightning wallets will be released for the general public to send and receive bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:30:19
Yeah I totally get why he is thinking that way, not his fault lol. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:28:47
God damn right it is.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:53:57
I am here for the tech, people say that everyone that is a believer went to r/btc but that isn't true. But making gains is a nice side effect of overthrowing an outdated money system that has no rhyme or reason. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:43:25
How's he supposed to pay for that?
@_date: 2019-07-17 02:48:39
Straight up
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:05:36
Yeah totally agree, Bitcoin simply has too much infrastructure behind it for it to continue in this downward trend. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:06:20
Well this is some good news.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:34:33
Once the lightning network is implemented Bitcoin will once again become a peer to peer currency that can be used instantly. Only a matter of time. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:58:34
You have been a redditor for 2 days but you been with us for 14 months? Hmm....
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:27:33
Hoping we avoided a dead cat bounce. I think this may be a floor and up from here. Bitcoin just has too much going on for it to dip any more. Implementation, devs, awareness, big money coming in, and lightning network around the corner. This is the time to get in. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:56:12
It's based on citizenship, so regardless of where you are you pay taxes based on what country you are a citizen in. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:20:36
I agree with you, I'm not sure that Bitcoin is the one coin to rule them all but I'm not sure the mainstream public has the capacity to understand multiple other coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:03:13
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:42:07
The way I'm looking at it, if it was just Bitcoin that dipped I would be more concerned. But almost all coins dipped. All that bcash did was make the whole crypto market less trustworthy and a recovery looks like a strong possibility. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:52:27
The run from 14k to 19k was definitely based on hype, totally agree with that. Before it hit the mainstream eye there were many reasons that Bitcoin landed in the position it did. Bitcoin has the most tech and its tough for that to go away overnight, and then there were the rumors of futures coming that continued the hype. If crypto has any chance to really catch on its through Bitcoin, I really believe that if bitcoins fail then crypto will fail as a whole. I've talked to countless people the past week who know nothing about crypto and all they care about is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:58:42
Pretty valid points. Once the weak hands get out, LN is implemented, and we get past this year I think Bitcoin will position itself better. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:57:06
He's probably referring to the most recent BCH attack where they flooded the market with transactions. Which in my humble opinion is in fact what happened. Though today I think this is just a dip and not some organized attack. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:57:48
If I could bet on it being 2018 I would go all in. It's been years since they announced their plans and just about all the tech is functional, they are just in a testing phase. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 20:15:58
Now this is what we have been waiting for. Looking really nice. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 04:07:38
Nice to see some people here still get it.
@_date: 2018-08-01 20:45:38
Fuck man, getting destroyed over here. All about the tech but these downtrends are tough to get through.
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:37:06
Based off the history of bitcoin this actually looks to be the case. We are falling into a hibernation period but we will eventually return to similar highs like last year and possibly even higher. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:15:42
Dropping so quick, hopefully we get a rebound. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:40:30
Are we to feel bullish even with the low volume?
@_date: 2018-05-20 17:46:34
I thought I smelled fresh bull in the air. Thanks for the confirmation. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 01:33:42
Big green dildo.
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:31:33
Yeah I'd sell if I were him...
@_date: 2014-05-21 23:14:18
She wants a percentage of your bitcoins "in case" you get divorced. Bit of a red flag there aye?
@_date: 2016-03-17 19:05:31
All they did was enable users to see their Coinbase account balance on the USAA balances page. Am I missing something here? Cool I guess but the title is a bit misleading. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:57:44
Nope been in bitcoin since 2013, just saying since the rally to $9700 we have been in steady decline ever since.
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:23:55
Everyone needs to chill out. Bitcoin is fine, just hold through this. Most of you seem to forget that we were in a 3 year bear market before the previous run. Bitcoin has proved all the naysayers wrong countless times. 
@_date: 2019-08-03 02:20:56
Pittsburgh Southside?
@_date: 2016-12-23 21:19:57
Yup, looks about right.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:30:57
Haha same...I am hopeful for the future though. Interestingly enough  these dips are very similar to past charts. My guess is over the next few months we will slowly creep back up and then see another large rally like last year. But what do I know...
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:46:26
Well sure yeah that could happen. Just saying to have patience. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:50:06
Well hey man if you believe in the tech and can afford to lose those $30 dollars then just go for it. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:05:56
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:39:55
Fucking brutal man. I am in for the long haul but this is rough. We have been in decline for over a month now. Hopefully Coinbase is able to bring in some institutional money...
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:10:50
Well fuck. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:11:45
It's a cycle, people get excited then it wears off. Hype will return as it has time and time again.
@_date: 2018-06-18 16:39:39
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:11:12
Nice, this is the stuff I like to hear.
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:11:28
I am feeling positive, who's with me?
@_date: 2019-08-05 04:57:07
I totally agree about what you are saying, the average joe won't be buying bitcoin in a recession. The thing you might be forgetting is how few have majority of the wealth in the US. The 99% will not be buying bitcoin during a recession but the top 1% might.
@_date: 2019-06-15 14:19:18
Yeah I'm with you on that.
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:37:49
My dawg, I have been here. I know how high we came from. There was a rally with upward trends for two to three weeks before hitting $9700. Since then we have literally been in decline almost every day. I know overall we are down big but it would just be nice to get a week or two of upward trends again. 
@_date: 2019-06-20 19:21:28
Let's go, that libra announcement....what a joke. There was a slight dip when it was announced but everyone knows who the true king of the castle is.
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:52:56
Wowee whoa wow
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:02:16
Holeee fuuudge monkees
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:12:32
Indeed it has, hopefully a year and half wiser...
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:07:58
Climbing back up to $6600 now. Maybe the dump is over?
@_date: 2019-06-15 14:26:21
Aw didn't know the tough man was so shy. He can show himself whenever he is ready.
@_date: 2019-06-21 22:07:55
Well not always true. Donald and the boys got rid of a lot of tax deductions for small businesses dealing with relocating. Republicans effectively raised my taxes because I'm moving as we speak and was pissed to find this out. They implemented this in 2017.
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:45:37
Wtf is happening, shit is crazy right now!
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:52:13
I agree, if we can hold at $6500 I think it would say a lot about the resiliency of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:12:07
Someone hold me, Vegeta's going Super Saiyan.
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:48:13
I'm hodling.
@_date: 2019-06-15 14:20:06
Is Vegeta going to make an appearance today?
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:05:16
Man I know unreal, haven't seen a run like this in a while.
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:16:35
1am here in the states but I am wide awake. This shit just got interesting.
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:31:52
@_date: 2019-04-05 20:50:30
Thank you, finally someone with some common sense. I am all for Bitcoin but people need to pull their heads of out their asses and stop always drinking the confirmation bias kool-aid that gets passed around here. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:26:13
Good god, never thought I'd see these numbers again. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:01:47
les go!!!!
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:29:32
Holy sheet
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:36:41
Bouncing hard!
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:37:42
Definitely thinking about buying more...
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:30:07
So question...with the lightning network, will Coinbase, Bitstamp, etc all have to implement this tech just like Segwit?
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:39:02
Theoretically the scarcity will increase because a lack of new coins being created. Soo...moon?
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:56:36
Okay so here's the thing, the market looks grim right now but I have a lot of hope for the future. Major investors would agree about this, specifically the investors in lightning. I am super excited to have a lightning wallet app on my phone, a true digital "bank" account. This is seriously one of the most exciting things to enter the bitcoin space in a long time. Though a lot of people are naysayers about lightning, saying the tech is too hard to understand. Here's the thing though, people don't need to know how the tech works. Do you think the average person even understands how the internet works? Nope, and as long as you build an user interface around a strong system that has a utility then people will use it. So with that said I cannot wait to send my friends money for beers through the lightning network and see where this all takes us!
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:02:40
Can't always go up, this happens. Bitcoin always rebounds.
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:09:00
Is Bitcoin supposed to be Rose or Jack in this situation?
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:37:12
We are going to retest the 6-7k levels. If that holds i think its up from there. If we go into 5k we are fucked. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:22:09
This thread has become so toxic...
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:33:20
Alright Bitcoin chill, let's pace ourselves here. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 02:16:36
Yes thank you...I was thinking the exact same thing reading the title. Can you guys post something without including your age, acting like some sort of prodigy? Give it up already. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:23:04
Every single mofo on here mixes up these two words. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:18:24
So with the G20 coming up on the 19th what kind of news can we expect? I am wondering if there will be more regulations talked about and if the price will reflect that...
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:21:44
How are you holding but want to get "back in"?
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:07:48
I haven't looked in to to get exact numbers but what was the worst crash? I remember it climbing from $90 to $1200 and then crashing hard way back in 2014 I believe?
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:45:56
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:52:02
this guy...
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:32:47
What? Care to provide any more info on this?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:13:11
Yeah, definitely won't crash that hard, I am wondering what that percentage was because right now we are down like almost 60%. Just wish we can hit the low already and then level out for a few months. Hate seeing the downward trend continue for no reason. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:55:40
Perfectly sums up how I felt this morning.
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:19:28
Everyone on here yesterday was freaking out lol. Lots of new kids playing ball.
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:47:19
Incredible how these comments come up every time there is an upward trend. Same answer every. single. time. If you believe in the currency you should invest, don't try to time the market because no one has a clue what is going to happen. You try to time the market and sell at a high or buy at a dip you will get freaking burned. If you buy on dips and it works out then you got lucky.
@_date: 2018-03-17 21:58:20
I don't know about you but I'm pretty tired of getting my credit card numbers stolen. Happens at least once a year. This system of how we have been doing things is outdated. Bitcoin + Lightning has better security and thats just one part of it. It's the future. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:48:19
Lol me too, I'm beginning to think I have a problem. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:20:06
Are you saying the current correction has nothing to with bans or this submission? Because we are talking about price, today's correction was because of India putting out a message that was misunderstood.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:15:48
Really hoping this is the floor. People need to stop freaking out about bans that aren't real.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:00:28
I don't think it will have any effect. When the Bitcoin Cash split happened there was a drop but I think it was because of the speculation surrounding Bitcoin Cash. r/BTC was supporting it like it was going to replace Bitcoin but then yesterday happened and it is now more evident than ever that Bitcoin is the future. Splitting for a second time I don't see people falling for it again. At least that is how it appeared to me.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:54:15
You fkin called it mate!!
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:35:15
This is truly amazing then. Just downloaded it as well, so pumped to see this. Great job Eclair team!!
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:11:20
He would say that the votes were manipulated and that miners wanted Bitcoin to have heavy fees so they could make money. When in reality it just came down to disagreeing about scalability options. In other words he is a sore loser. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:07:47
Bitcoin being worth more means that the network can handle more users. If 1 Bitcoin was only worth say $10 dollars then it wouldn't be able to scale to handle the entire globe. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:41:47
Let's go!! Keep strong Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-04-16 00:30:25
Yeah we will see I guess, just not sure what people think is going to happen. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 01:01:56
fuck. yes.
@_date: 2018-04-15 06:49:06
I'm not saying Bitcoin should just go up and up.  I'd prefer a market that was steady and less volatile but this is just what happens when you have emerging technologies. Same thing happened to tech companies in the 90's. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:02:50
Ya they literally lost the majority of the votes. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:43:40
Well this is why Bitcoin isn't worth $10 dollars a coin. $180 million is nothing when speaking in global terms. That is why it's worth a lot more right now. This mixed with speculation makes people want to be a part of it which in turn drives the price up more. Personally I don't think we think we will ever reach $1 mil coins because that is just too much. But Bitcoin absolutely has the space to grow to $25-100k a coin. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 00:24:37
Not sure what the big deal is with tax day. Everyone should know what they owe at this point and have already taken that money out and have now reinvested what they have remaining.
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:31:45
So I should be able to use this to send bitcoin using lightning network on mainnet?
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:17:16
Yep same here man, I would be somewhat interested in Bitcoin Cash if it wasn't so deceptive and misleading. There have been a lot of posts over there regarding those issues lately. So at least some users are seeing through that bullshit. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 05:30:00
Shit, I have PNC as well...
@_date: 2018-04-16 00:32:15
*losing. You people sound so fucking stupid when you try to make a point but don't even know English that well. LOSING people...not loosing. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:33:11
Right now yes and everyone realized that. Bitcoin Cash is the temporary solution to scaling but long term Bitcoin is a better bet. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 18:00:53
Dude, if I had a Bitcoin for every missed opportunity in this market I'd be a millionaire. Can't beat yourself up about it. 
If you are just going short term I would probably hold off on buying for at least a week or so and see where the market goes. Even if it goes up and you miss another opportunity there is still so much room for Bitcoin to grow. But short term it could definitely fall back down. If you want to go long term then I'd say yes buy now and hodl for at least a year. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 02:23:05
I upvoted you on that day. I was with you then and I'm with you now. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 18:04:03
I built a computer on newegg when they first introduced bitcoin on the website, I got 10% off. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:26:29
Yeah I am having this issue as well.
@_date: 2015-03-30 00:36:27
I didn't no, but I work in this type of field. 
@_date: 2016-10-29 17:48:04
Yeah kind of contradicting ideas. We want it to grow but also want it to be stable. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 02:32:41
Exactly what I've been thinking. We will see...
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:00:23
Projecting my frustrations...lol. Alright bud you got me. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 21:14:56
Yeah, holy volatility. I look away for 10 mins and it goes down by $15 bucks...
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:17:27
She's the best :)
@_date: 2015-03-29 04:45:21
What do you want done?
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:23:35
Lol, you know that one dude was like this thing is skyrocketing, better buy in now before $10k.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:46:11
I am beginning to believe that when enough people sell to Coinbase that they take off the restrictions until more people buy them. You just need to keep refreshing...
@_date: 2016-07-01 13:27:47
Shift cards use visa so they do this as well.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:33:08
I am interested to see how the general public will respond to the new prices. This time last year everyone I know was saying it was a bubble, and now that prices are coming down I wonder what they will have to say. I think realistically we needed this to happen in order for the public to reevaluate their thinking. Long term this is a good thing.
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:17:34
Any plans to bring this to windows phone or android?
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:10:59
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:48:46
The man must love pizza, sounds like hes made a lot on bitcoins and wants to just eat pizza for free.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:09:07
Let's fucking go, over $9,000!!
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:11:24
I keep telling myself that we are still in the beginning of the bitcoin surge. Even though there are a ton of people buying in this is just now happening and you have to think about how much more bitcoin can grow. Someone else said to buy what you can afford and I would advise that too. I really don't see how it can be a bad decision at this point as we have only gone up for weeks. 38k seems like a lot hereC and so if bitcoins really do overtake other currencies how long are we talking here? Years? Months? Any insight?
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:11:32
Above $1000 but probably not $2000. Number one on google trends, US senate hearing, government calling it legitimate and that is all in the last week. Can anyone tell me a reason why they would ever go way down again?
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:32:33
Would you guys advise to transfer coinbase funds to another wallet? Can coinbase crash by itself?
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:54:23
I think that these sudden drop in percentages will eventually go away once the hype passes over from the past couple weeks/ months. So instead of 20-25% changes there may be only 2-5% changes.
