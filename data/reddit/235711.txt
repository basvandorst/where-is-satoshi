I used this logic several years ago, but as far as i know it's still valid: 
According to that link, the public key is one to one mapped to a bitcoin address.
The private key and the curve parameters generate the public key and the public key is transformed to a bitcoin address.

Early 2013. Sister told me there was something called bitcoin, I ignored her. Mid/late 2013, my sister told me bitcoin was shooting up in price. I started looking into it and was absolutely blown away that a program, I am a developer, could be so elegant, so beautiful, that it could potentially, in theory, replace most of the banking system.
I studied bitcoin for months in a manic phase. When you are older, and something completely new comes along, the experience is a gem, a jewel to treasure because as we age less novel ideals make it into our world view. I still remember how the ideas behind bitcoin bloomed into my world view like an exploding volcano.
Tried to write my own copy of a full node, but only made it as far as wallet software and parsing blocks. I created some homegrown code to generate and hide the private key in plain sight and made a cold storage address. I figured a generic hacker would not be able to target homegrown code, but instead would target well known wallet formats for example.
I took out a 401k loan of $10,000 to buy bitcoin but got scared and convinced myself to only spend 2k on bitcoin and use the other 8k for more traditional  financial needs. Certainly my biggest regret with bitcoin.
I bought 21 bitcoin around $100 per and moved them to my cold wallet. I also used a few other bitcoin to buy some stuff online, for example overstock.
I told myself I would withdraw those bitcoin if i could ever buy a house with them. Four years later, as the price sky-rocketed to 20k, I struggled to decide if i should transfer from cold storage and sell some but I felt the rule I made four years ago was still in effect and greed was my biggest enemy. Since I could buy a house outright in the area I wanted, I decided to transfer to coinbase and sell a portion.
I spent 4 days trying to retreive my bitcoin from the old buggy code I had written four years ago. Also, I couldn't find the source I used originally so I had to rewrite several portions and apparently I was a lot smarter 4 years ago. There were several moments when I threw in the towel and thought I had lost them but i got lucky and was able to overcome the bugs. I sold 70% of my holdings and am going to CO in March to buy my house. BCH was an added bonus and I got rid of those.
I am very grateful to this community, and bitcoin. Reading my own story, I still can't believe this has really happened. Coworkers and friends, after four years of ignoring bitcoin or down talking it, are just amazed.

Well, you could open many accounts and bring them all up to some level of credit worthiness and then spring your trap for example. Although it takes time you can multiply your winnings.
It does sound like a good idea though. I would be more willing to loan to a bitcoin address that could prove it had paid back loans in the past.

Does investing even make sense with bitcoin? 
Let's say you have x US dollars. You should/must invest if the inflation rate is positive because you need your money to 'grow' faster than inflation otherwise you lose standing with respect to your peers and over time you become poorer and poorer.
How is this the same with bitcoin? It seems like the complete opposite. Look at this short from the history of bitcoin:

I just think it's a layer that presents an extra risk just when you might need it to be there for you. You cannot access your wallet if the bank won't let you into your safe deposit area. Therefore, they have control again.
Trying to secure gold and physical commodities against theft in your house seems very risky because someone can just simply break in, find the loot, and leave. In the scenario i present, how do they find the loot? It could be in a book on the bookshelves, it could be in a file disguised to look like a budget, it could literally be anything that produces a digitial result and there can be multiple copies in different formats all hiding in plain sight.

'computer power' is a term that depends on what you are computing. If you have two computers computing apples then they can be compared. If one computer is computing apples and the other oranges, then comparison is difficult because you would need to know how many oranges to make an apple.

If we imagine a bitcoin economy and a negative growth rate then we are left with inflation. This is because as people die, their bitcoins would be returned to the general economy.
If we were to mirror our economy in such a negative growth environment then this inflation could be controlled by saving more bitcoins. The savings rate vs negative growth rate would control if the general population experienced deflation or inflation.
One possibility for central control over this 'savings rate' might be mandates so that transactions without minimum balances would not be confirmed. Upping the minimum balance faster than the negative growth rate would cancel the inflation everyone experienced from the negative growth.
Of course assuming negative growth is crazy or is it? There are many organisations that predict a peak of population sometime this century including the UN.

Well, they didn't get my coins but they could have because the way i generated my key was not smart since there were only 4 billion or so (32 bits) possible keys that I could have chosen from and I used a popular (reproducible) pseudo-random generator.
If someone else out there realized that this was likely they could have made a database with all of the 4 billion inputs and their corresponding keys. This way, if they see an address in the blockchain that corresponds to one of the 4 billion keys they have made for themsleves then they can take those coins.
The solution is to use a strong random number generator that essentially takes a large number of bits for a seed rather than just 32.
I know there are others out there who were using the same methods as myself because i generated a collision when i had a byte order problem that was interpreted as a negative number.

Without any other information it doesn't seem an attacker has any leverage. But add any outside information to the above scenario and it is different.
If i see you trading coins with someone and i know what their public address is, then i know what your public address is. If i have a huge database and some type of probabilistic model of who own's what set of address's then I have a pretty good idea of who is doing what.
Although we do not know who Satoshi is, the more BTC he wishes to move the more unlikely it is that he can remain anonymous seems pretty clear but imagine also that if we can connect a decent percentage of actual people to their sets of address then Satoshi faces another threat and that is just moving any BTC to one of the known people.
The larger the percentage of the address pool you can connect to people, the easier it is to identify new users or those that remain anonymous so far because each new transaction only needs to bridge a gap between those who are still anonymous and the ever growing pool of users who are not.
This is a powerful dynamic. Any individual or institution that can amass a database that connects people to bitcoin address will have a big data application.

This is just my opinion but the whole safety deposit box link would make me nervous. It is possible to hide these keys in plain sight. Basically you want to just look at your key and think about unusual ways you could write that information down without anyone else understanding what it is.
Obviously with this method it is best to tell no one but you would want to consider what would happen in the event of your death perhaps.
If you give it a few days and put some effort into it you can come up with a system.

Made my own address generator but didn't use a cryptographically secure random number generator. I transferred 5 BTC to my cold storage with a grin but then about 30 minutes later realized my key was only 32 bits and i was a dumb ass. Then I had to try and change my code to be secure, write code to pull my weak key from my hide in plain sight source, import my key, and finally move the coins back to my blockchain.info wallet all before someone realized what i had done.
Due to this experience, i am thinking of using some well known random algorithims with 32 bit seeds to see if i can find any others out there like myself one day.

With this modification, the credit for bitcoin public address prefixes is tracked. Let's say you have a bitcoin address that looks like this:
In this case for someone to steal your identity could be quite difficult. The pattern of the prefix does not need to be an english word but it needs to be unique. Anyone with a key to that prefix 'owns' that credit rating. The longer the prefix, the more secure the credit rating.

I am under the opinion that bitocin is not the cause of low-carbon/negative growth, but instead the tool that will allow it to proceed.
Our current money system cannot function well without actual economic growth. At the same time we are approaching a period of negative growth or at least stalling compared to our heyday.
Bitcoin emerges on the scene to bring humanity through this natural period of negative growth. It is not here to save, but to destroy. Bitcoin will allow humanity to calculate who lives and who dies whereas our current political (money) system is incapable of this. This is because bitcoin has no center. Who can we petition if bitcoin decides we should die?
Although many would look on such a period of negative growth as a horror of horrors I do not feel this way. Consider the way bones heal:


There are three major phases of fracture healing, two of which can be further sub-divided to make a total of five phases;
1. Reactive Phase
i. Fracture and inflammatory phase
ii. Granulation tissue formation
2. Reparative Phase
iii. Cartilage Callus formation
iv. Lamellar bone deposition
3. Remodeling Phase
v. Remodeling to original bone contour
I am thinking bitcoin is similar to step 3 of human civilization.
 
We will carve back our overgrowth and on the other side of that process will be something we cannot predict.

If you generate the address offline, you do not necessarily have to import that key as far as i know because you could instead just create a transaction record, sign it, and send it to the bitcoin network. I am not sure what software allows this though.
Both you and your friend must pick a 256 bit number. That's about 77 decimal digits. Many times with offline wallets someone would like to pick a special 77 digit number that can be remembered but would be hard from someone else to guess. In this case, a hashing function that takes an input of any length and outputs a psuedo-random 256 bit number.
If the input to the hashing function is the same, then the resulting 256 number will be the same. Let's say you use hash a music file, of a song you like, to generate your key. That seems pretty random, but if anyone else out there has the exact same song in digital format and feeds it as input into their hashing function, then the same key will be output.


You do not have to give up your private key to make a transaction. You only need to digitally sign the transfer with your private key in a way that others can verify with your public key.

bitcoin has been a huge paradigm shift for me. Before, i saw no way to stop the juggernaut that we call growth. Now, i think it may be possible. It seems many people are conditioned to believe that growth is necessary and very important. They do not see that it can become pathological. How much of this hyper growth (over consumption/greed) can be attributed to the engineering attributes of our current money system?
I see bitcoin as a tool that will bring us together, not just globally redefining and marginalizing states, but by removing us from the rat-race of growth and giving us something else. I have no idea what that something is. Bitcoin is so far outside of everything i have ever known. I am charmed by its beauty in a algorithmic sense.
I have always heard, if you want to change the system, be the change you would like to see, but how? Before bitcoin, it seems impossible for change. Now, i see a possibility and I feel empowered and giddy with delight.
Of course, it would be nice to be rich also, but i try to tell myself that the real gift of bitcoin is love. Love for humanity and actual hope for a better way.
I'm just thankful to the people who have given this gift to humanity. Not just the inventors and early adopters, but the users, the miners, the hoarders, the exchangers and all of us.

I wonder if we could make a distinction or two about the type of theft.
In one case, a program is fishing for key words or other activity that trigger the payload. This is not a targeted attack. I think using non standard tools is good defense against this type of attack because there are 256 bit numbers everywhere but if one of these guys come across a wallet.dat file then they have an advantage.
Another type of attack, the targeted attack, would be more personal. Special knowledge about you and your BTC stack would most likely come into play. You will not be the victim of a targeted attack unless there is some type of large payoff. The payoff does not have to be BTC though. This type of attack is much more dangerous.

Bitcoin is a protocol (a set of rules), so you do not need to use any particular piece of software to send or receive coins. You only need to talk to others in the bitcoin network using the protocol.
However, bitcoin is a complicated (though beautiful) piece of software so there are few alternatives at this time for a full implementation of the protocol. I believe there there will be many alternatives soon.
Also, since the vast majority of nodes are running the software that was originally created by Satoshi, the organizers of that software have a certain clout they could throw around since most people are using their software.

There is a good solution to this delima and that is for coinbase to offer the account an option where the only btc exit address is yours and that cannot be changed for that account.
This will solve both issues so if you get hacked all the attacker can do is send btc to your address and if your account coins are sent to some other address then you know it was coinbase who is at fault.
I sent an email to coinbase asking for this service but they do not offer it yet. It would not be all that hard to implement. I will migrate to a service broker who can offer that kind of security if available.

If you go to brainwallet.org you will see that there is a default key generated with the words correct horse battery staple. These words lead to a key and when i checked there were .339 coins in there. You are free to import that key into a wallet as your own and transfer that money out to another address. Anyone is free to 'steal' that money right now and any other account that they can guess. In my view theft is protected by math not law.
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:42:06
Yes it's possible but it would take forever to intentionally do it. Whereas taking advantage of the human being's inability to pick a random number actually pays off.
Let's say i know there are math people out there who generate their private keys with their favorite integer sequence. So maybe there is a prime lover out there who generates their private key with primes less than 256:
But how do i know what their favorite sequence is? No problem, just download OEIS database of sequences and try them all. OEIS is not a collection of random sequences, but instead a collection of sequences interesting to humans.
Or, let's say i know there are people out there who generate their private keys by sha256 hasing their favorite sentence from a book.

and if he does not, could he find one hiding in plain sight? A chess board with 4 symbols for each square holds a key nicely. An image, a set of 128 random dates out of 256 days, an audio recording that can be hashed to produce the key, even a particular directory structure (not the files, the pattern of sub directories) is quite capable of holding your key.

Imagine you decide to flip a coin 256 times to generate your private key so you know that it will be random. Now imagine that every time you flip that coin you keep getting tails. It's amazing. It's a fair coin, but you keep flipping tails, over and over. After 255 times, you finally flip a single head, and then you flip one more tail.
After you flip your 255 tails in a row you are astonished to see that the bitcoin address you just created starts with '1Lag'

I think it would be simple. Just imagine an exchange that will not transfer out unless it is to the same address that opened the account and there is no way to change that for that account.

If someone hacks your acount, so what, all they can do is transfer to your wallet.

I don't know what the future holds, but as a developer i can say the core idea of bitcoin is one of the most beautiful tools i've ever seen. It's easy, it's based on math, it's decentralized, and it works.
This is why i buy bitcoin. Beauty speaks for itself. If something else comes along that is actually more beautiful, this does not decrease the beauty of bitcoin. The Pythagorean Theorem has been around for 2500 years and it's still just as beautiful as the day it was conceived and very useful too!

This! Ever since i learned about bitcoin i feel empowered. No need to listen to broken promise after promise, no need to follow the actions of these large institutions with disapproval  anymore. They have become meaningless to me. Their words have always rang hollow with corruption and greed but now, their voices fade and a new system consumes my attention.
I've sat back for years and watched this system ravage the earth and it's people with their greed because there was nothing i could do! Fuck it, were all worthless greedy assholes is how i felt.
That has changed. Now, i bitcoin. It might not change the world for the better but at least i have been empowered to act. 
Thank you Satoshi and all of the early adopters. Thank you for giving me the tool to act with. It means more than i can ever say not necessiarly because it will succeed and bring about utopia but because I can now remove myself from the most immoral system known to mankind hell bent on destroying everything and everyone in it's path.
I am not a part of that anymore. I am a bitcoiner now and it feels good.

I think the key to your argument is that difficulty lags necessarily. In this case, there can be a type of trap if many miners leave the network at once. This could happen if all of a sudden many miners are loosing money. As you point out, that possibility is larger around halving times but it could also happen with a steep price drop.
Of course, trying to reduce the lag between difficulty and the block rate seems it would have its own problems since then the difficulty would be more volatile.
Another point to consider is that if difficulty moves down rapidly, then bitcoin becomes more vulnerable to a 51% attack.
My understanding is the next halving event is 2017. At least that gives the system a little time to prepare and think about the consequences of that event.
It's funny that the whole situation reminds me of a bank run where the miner's computational resources take on the role of deposits.

No bitcoin stolen yet but my debit card was just hacked. I am a newish coinbase user. I do not suggest that the two are related i just mention my similar experience.
Now, i am terrified. I generated my own key with my own software so i am thinking my cold storage address is still safe as i never 'typed' anything. It is awful being paranoid now. 
When did the attack originate is the most pressing question for me.
I recently read this paper and it was spectacular.
The paper introduced me to the idea of publicly declaring coins 'stolen' so as to generate plausible deniability of possession so now i always wonder.
Many other gems in there too!

In an inflationary money system, a central authority can create money to regulate the overall flow. In a deflationary system, i am wondering if they could regulate by destroying money.
One possibility is by destroying bitcoins. If I have 1/2 of all bitcoins and I prove to the world that I have destroyed them by say sending them here: 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE then i have encouraged everyone with bitcoins to spend because all of a sudden the amount of goods they used to buy with 1 BTC doubled.

This is just a guess. In thermodynamics a closed system must tend toward equilibrium whereas an open system does not feel this restraint.
Let's imagine two bitcoin economies.
1.) An open system where dollars flow through the bitcoin economy.
2.) A closed system where bitcoin is the universal currency and not traded against other currencies because there are none.
If the price of bitcoin vs dollars continues to trend up, is it possible that at some point, we move to 2?
If so, then i suspect over time, those bitcoins are restrained to become more distributed and eventually there would be a 'heat death' of the bitcoin economy if more decimal places were not introduced.

difficult to audit hardware wallet could be leaking its keys material
via its signatures. Even without producing insecure K values it could
use the choice of K to leak a couple bits of an encrypted root key
with every signature, and allow the malicious party to recover the
keys by simply observing the network. Making the signatures
deterministic would make this kind of misbehavior practically

Good points. I guess i just consider hashing encryption without knowing the key. Take any hash function. There is always a key that exists to reverse the hash but it is unknown.
If the one who is turning the handle saves the rate of turning in order to reverse the process, then that is encryption, but if they do not, then that is hashing.

If the global economy is experiencing negative growth then a central bitcoin 'saver' could control the rate of inflation by saving more or less.
If you take our positive growth economy and replace the central money creator with a central money destroyer (savings), and replace the growth with loss (negative growth), then you have an economic system with many aspects similar to our current system where a central saving authority controls the rate of inflation vs the rate of negative growth by hoarding rather than printing.

Some basic simple systems are able to meet their requirements without needing large amounts of complexity. This is the essence of beauty. A beautiful scientific theory is one that explains many measurements with a simple equation. 
 If the writer of this article thinks it is easy to produce a program that is still running 4 years later with just a few modifications and has a market cap of &gt; 1 billion then he should think again. This is unheard of. Try to hire a programmer to make such a system for your own profit and see how much you need to sink into it. The reason bitcoin as a program has succeeded is because it is brilliant, simple, and solves many (difficult) requirements.
It is the nature of those requirements that sort the possible solutions by their value. By comparing myspace to bitcoin I suspect you vary the requirements but what logic is there that a money system requires more than bitcoin already offers?


So bitcoin is susceptable to being replaced but fiat isn't?
What about gold. Surely, a better store of value would have been found by now. Gold should have been replaced already.


Why not just change SHA 256 to 512 WHEN IT IS NEEDED? This is a minor detail of the bitcoin protocol and there would be no resistance to changing this to 512 or another method IF it was known to be compromised or soon to be.

Wish i knew. If i look to the future and bitcoins role, i am shut down by ignorance every time.
I've never lived in a deflationary world before, but neither do i think economic growth can continue as robustly as it has in the past.
I fear resource shortages may be coming for many of us. In this case, wouldn't an inflationary currency just lose meaning? If the world stops growing in terms of resource input, then a deflationary currency might be just what is needed? In this type of world, you hold on to what you have because it is more than you will have in the future.
