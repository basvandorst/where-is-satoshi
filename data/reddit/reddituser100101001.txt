You don't have to put up with any of that "crap". Just don't use them.

Virwox... that is what I was thinking of. Going to Google up some info hopefully but what are the pitfalls of doing the purchase this way?

Can you be a little more specific on why you wouldn't recommend this?

I'm done with banks, at least as much as I can. Just have a year left on my mortgage and every other debt has been paid off. Been using bylls.com since the start of the year to use my coins for as much as I can.

Can someone explain why the coins are selling for so much? To me, a complete noob,  it just doesn't seem to make any sense that they're selling for $500 each?

Even if the market was a honeypot,  they'd have no access to his personal information because he never purchased anything.

I tried to buy GTA V when it released for the PC on green man using bitcoin but they had removed the option. Guessing they have put it back up?

I made a complaint about the app to the google store after reading this thread. Only lists 10 downloads when I look at it on my android tablet so hopefully not much damage done.

Do you sell anything you would recommend for colder climates and shorter growing seasons? I grew some cayenne last year but my jalapeño and green peppers didn't fair too well.

I'm on a mobile atm so excuse my ignorance a bit..... was the article just the 1 page and no pictures? Kind of left me wanting a lot more information and context.

Made a $750 payment to my visa. I used to use yestobitcoins.com till they pulled their cc payments. Hopefully this option stays around a lot longer.
