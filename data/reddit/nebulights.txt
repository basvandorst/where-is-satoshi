It really isn't, but a lot of the high profile companies are using Coinbase which if I understand correctly doesn't do it as easily as Bitpay.  There may be different checkout flows on their custom sites as well, maybe some different account issues?
I recently opened up my site and it's been international with Bitpay from day 1.

Damn, wish I could do that.  Gotta wait 3-4 business days for the transfer to happen, and I can't use their interac feature as my bank isn't on the supported list.

That sounds really cool!  What kind of risks would you have with having to trust the gateway?  If the receiver had internet access and could verify the payment went through, would there be any?
I could see things getting riskier if neither party has internet access and thus must trust the gateway to do everything and send valid responses?

Does the restaurant accept bitcoin?

Is it just me or does the site not work if you don't share location?  The search box does nothing?

Instant access with a bank transfer?  They just assume it'll go through and are willing to trust their fraud procedures in case of fraud?

With a dual sim phone, would it be possible to do all the phone stuff on one, and then have the other sim card be completely open source and only do the signing, that way there isn't other stuff there to complicate things?

Is there any way for the merchant to pay the fee for the customer?  Join two transactions so they get mined sooner?
Then the merchant can guarantee it'll get picked up appropriately for a still pretty small fee.

They wouldn't need to buy QR code scanners.  The customer would scan off the tablet itself.

Hey Everyone,
I'm giving $80 off my Nebulei for Bitcoin Black Friday with the code bitcoinbf, good until the end of Sunday.
Hand-made in beautiful Victoria BC, these things a are  blast to wear out at parties and music festivals.  Fully controllable from your Android 4.0+ smart phone you can design all your own patterns or use the ones it comes with!  
I've done my best to keep bitcoin in my supply chain. The hardware controller was designed and paid for in bitcoin, as well as my hosting at Namecheap. I'm keeping 20% of all sales in Bitcoin. 
Check out the Android app at 
App Demo (designing starts at 50s) -

If you're purchasing a service, he could set up a business account on Bitpay and have it exchanged for 1%.

Database errors when I try to make an account.  Failed to add user.

Cool, thanks for the feedback. I've been contemplating it for quite awhile as an update, we'll see...  Maybe I can start with 1 exchange and see what the effort looks like.
If I do it, it cool if I PM ya to check it out?

Question for ya - I wrote an open source android app that you manually input the coins you own into it exactly for this reason, at least I could trust my own app wasn't abusing my own data.  I used the app to try some new programming techniques as well, so extra bonus for me.
How big of a market do you think there would actually be for a open source, local only app (no servers to send data to), where you can put in watch addresses, as well as add your API key to exchanges?
Is it worth the effort?  Will people actually use it?  That's a lot of integration work to handle multiple cryptos and exchanges.

Makes me wonder if we could have modular asic unit, where you can just slide the new chips in each season, and the old chips can go back to the manufacturer to be recycled.
As long as it's cheaper than your yearly heating costs to replace only the chips that could work.   If i'm not mistaken, manufacturing ASICs is very cheap, it's the design that is expensive? If you mass produce enough of them, it might be possible? 
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:52:17
The theory is that being open source and thus (hopefully) trustworthy would be a big enough difference for many people?  If that's not big enough (or almost enough on its own) I'm not sure it's worth the effort.
Wouldn't I want the keys to get all the extra details the exchange can provide for people who keeps some coins there?
I don't know what my address is on my exchange?

Leaving the fan on the furnace on, with the heat off would help.  Do you have control over that?
@_date: 2015-04-29 02:22:15
Not really following how this works.  Are they doing a periodical hash of all their hashes and putting that on the blockchain?
