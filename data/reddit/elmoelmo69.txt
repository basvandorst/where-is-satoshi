Worst thing I’ve seen in a while
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:56:24
Why is neo there?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:40:54
Cardano is nothing but a paper. Pass.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:41:56
Huge 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:58:20
Exactly. A cleanse is much needed.
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:42:34
Bring that dominance down !

Hi Roger II
@_date: 2019-07-03 05:14:16
Quality shitpost ��
@_date: 2019-07-05 06:43:44
In 2030 OP will most likely be able to pay for college and the car with his btc without going back to fiat. Take a breath.

Nothing looks bullish at the moment. Even holding 6400 would put our RSI to shit and break the bullish pattern that was starting to form.
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:55:28
Normal volatility. It is up +5.4% for the past 24 hours, chill.
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:34:15
I personally sold all my BCH as soon as I got them and re-invested the gains on Neo when it was priced at US$ 10. No regret whatsoever. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:50:25
Out of 20 needed.
@_date: 2018-10-31 07:06:09
Priorities 
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:32:25
any alternatives?
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:48:39
Don't use Bittrex, I'm at 13 confirmations after 14 hours.
@_date: 2017-08-10 06:27:12
Bittrex if you are interested in Neo, though i would not call it a small coin ;)
@_date: 2017-08-04 10:42:01
Bittrex but needs 20 confirmation or approx. 15 hours.
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:54:05
Just did and managed to get 4 confirmations after 2 hours. 16 to go.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:23:10
Good job !
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:25:41
Nothing just waited actually. Unsure why this took so long.
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:37:17
I use Mycelium and it has never happened to me.
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:47:25
Sleep all day. Wake up with no changes.
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:57:18
Who managed to dump already? I got 8 confirmations on Bittrex so far and worry about not getting anything for my BCC by tonight.
@_date: 2017-08-10 04:57:16
Ok just locked in. Block 479896 ( 2017-08-10 04:55:20 + 773 minutes ) 
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:19:04
Download electron cash. Just did earlier and got my BCC in minutes.
@_date: 2017-08-04 10:12:43
Got 8 confirmations in 6 hours so plan on a minimum 15 hours I guess.
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:48:00
Not touching it with gloves.
@_date: 2017-08-16 03:01:39
All trades on e-toro are CFD (contract for difference) so you don't actually own the stocks or bitcoin you trade. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:57:36
Send your btc to another wallet (i.e Breadwallet). Once this is done and your mycelium account is empty, download the electron cash wallet and import your mycelium private keys on it. Just did today and got my bcc in minutes.
@_date: 2019-06-07 06:51:21
Even the atm is like ‘I don’t want this fiat shit bro’
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:18:40
Maybe sell it, you don't seem ready to handle bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:09:05
Should be yes.
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:52:50
A quarter billion sell order would definitely trigger the price down.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:05:31
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:04:27
Where is the nav pill?
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:59:59
Sold at 7200 bought back at 6000, I don’t mind that bullshit
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:24:43
Same here, when do u plan to re-enter?
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:11:48
Done already
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:37:11
Hello roger
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:04:51
This is the best thing I’ve seen in a while
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:50:09
Crazy buying pressure !
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:24:09
Another shitpost
@_date: 2019-04-02 15:56:10
Nice and clean.
@_date: 2019-04-05 10:16:14
What OP does not say is that he actually own 1 btc for each hard btc sitting on these boxes. Just a smarter way to show how loaded you are ;)
@_date: 2019-04-05 10:56:00
Quality shitpost 
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:16:00
Maybe just search those exact key words on reddit and you ll have enough to read for 2 weeks?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:46:35
Bought mid 17, do not give a fuck now.
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:06:35
If you are able to keep a piece of paper without showing it to anyone, it is safe.
@_date: 2017-09-08 01:14:16
Breadwallet for amount &lt; 1btc
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:10:40
Because some people on Bitfinex and Bitstamp are willing to sell their bitcoin at a discount.
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:03:16
That guy is a legend already
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:21:21
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:35:31
Bread as well?
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:05:15
Im out of Mycellium for a while now, times change.
