As a huge NASCAR fan, and a supporter of Bitcoin (writing this comment on a Chromebook I bought with Bitcoin) for over two years; this is awesome.
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:23:33
It makes sense though, and is good, simple, advice.
It's a simple way to tell people who are learning about Bitcoin that whatever money they put into it, could be completely gone tomorrow. It clearly illustrates the risk.
If you're living comfortable with a full time job, tossing $20 into BTC won't really sting too badly if it all crashes tomorrow. But taking your entire life savings and buying BTC with it, only to have it crash eventually would devastate anybody.
So yes, only convert USD into BTC which you could potentially live without if it crashes.
Anytime I buy BTC with USD, I consider that money gone forever, because it very well could be. I ask myself -- "If it crashed tomorrow, would I still be alright financially?" If the answer is no, then it's obvious that it's a bad idea.
It's great advice for people who want to know more about Bitcoin as an investment. Don't act like it's not.

There's a very good chance it could. I don't know if India has been anxiously waiting to buy Bitcoin, so who knows what the buy orders will look like. But yeah, if they start buying it up, the value could climb.

Macs are nowhere near as safe as Apple would like everybody to believe. Macs aren't prone to malware attacks simply because they're nowhere near as popular as Windows computers. Macs are sometimes the first to fall at hacker conventions, and it literally happens within a minute.
Unlikely that OP was a victim of some sort of malware attack, but, no, Macs are no more secure than a Windows computer, especially with a non-tech savvy person behind the wheel.
@_date: 2014-01-07 02:48:09
Like I said. I really have no idea if they want to buy or not. I have no idea how difficult it was to buy before, as opposed to now. Maybe they were waiting for a statement from their government, so their funds wouldn't get seized when trying to buy/sell BTC?
Bottom line is, it's better news than the Indian government deciding to halt all Bitcoin sales through centralized banks.

Your friend speaks the truth. Going to a race is a total blast. I happen to be a huge fan, but I think even non-fans would enjoy a race weekend. You camp out, drink food, cook on the grill, and then take in a race that will leave your ears ringing for a few days after. 
On TV, it can look pretty boring sometimes, every fan will admit that -- but every sport can have those games or matches that can fall into a lull of no action. But, the sight, sound, and smell of a live NASCAR race. It's a total sensory assault.

It's funny to me that you want to argue against somebody who is simply sharing smart investment advice. Who cares if it's $20 or $2, 000 -- if one wants to invest money, the best way to do it is safely within means. Over time, $20 - $100 here and there will add up to a nice payday. There's absolutely nothing wrong with small amounts -- especially when it comes to Bitcoin. It's all the rage right now, everybody wants in, but most people getting into it really don't know how to invest in the long term and ride out the swings. And that's exactly why there was a fucking suicide hotline stickied at the top of -- because some people put way too much in it.

That blows man. Sorry for your loss, and I hope you're able to recover it somehow.
I have to ask though, how is a brainwallet any more secure than a wallet.dat file, encrypted with a 30 character passphrase, stored inside of a .zip file with an equally good passphrase? Seems like once you start relying on any 3rd party to generate ANYTHING for you, it's compromised from the start.
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:14:28
Couple questions:
1) My computer alone mines at about 480-500 m/hash. I have access to two other computers that mine at around 70 - 80 m/hash each. Where should I be mining at? I mine at 50btc now, but is there some other pool that is hands down the best one to mining for? I obviously want to get the most I can for my shares.
2) I refuse to create an online wallet, so I've been just saving mine locally. It's encrypted with an 8 word mixed caps key. I do a backup every time I transfer money into my wallet. I store one copy on my dropbox account, and recently I've thought about storing it on a USB drive, as well as e-mailing it to myself. Is this adequate? I know having so many copies of it makes it easier for it to fall into the wrong hands, but I'm quite confident in the passphrase I've chosen for the wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:45:19
Is it showing any unconfirmed balance? What if you check the address on blockchain.info -- does it show any increase in coin there?

@_date: 2013-04-10 13:17:49
You's a big fine wallet!
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:29:34
Is there even any benefit to an online wallet, other than having your BTC available to you wherever you go?
With the current value of bitcoin, it almost seems like a no-brainer to keep your wallet encrypted, and backed up on multiple drives/locations, rather than in the hands of perfect strangers. It might slow down your ability to spend bitcoin quickly and easily, but consider the alternative? Numberous hacks and stolen bitcoins every day lately.
Is there any other time in recent history where so much money has traded hands so quickly, easily, and anonymously, with little to no recourse?
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:37:41
Don't exchange into bitcoin what you can't afford to lose. Buy a little at a time if that helps you. Instead of spending $10 or $20 on dinner, buy btc.
The stakes are too high for me to exchange USD into btc at the moment. However, I've got a few computers that have been doing some heavy mining in the last week. The electricity is pennies compared to what I could potentially lose even if I bought 1 btc.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:18:46
Same thing happened to me. I haven't mined anything in months, and today I just happen to log into my 50btc account and it says I have 415. It's definitely some sort of error, but we'll see what happens.

Oh, well then. I happily stand corrected.
As a dude also into tattoos, I've thought about a QR code, but yeah, I don't know where I'd send it. Other than some sort of ID or something to that effect. A BTC address isn't a bad idea though.
I would say a QR code tattoo could be risky though. Go to an artist with shitty line work, it may not work at all. Curious to see how it holds up to a sunburn and what not though. You should test this -- for science!

First step is to transfer them into some sort of wallet that you own. There are many wallets to choose from, and how you handle the associated wallet file it creates is entirely up to you, but best to keep it on a computer that's not even connected to the internet, and only connect when you wish to receive those coins. And encrypt it.
A good place to start may be [electrum](
No troll here, but, I feel like this is research that should have been done long before you even thought about putting half your life savings into it.

I used to get this problem quite frequently -- no idea why. Even after uninstalling Bitcoin-QT, deleting the entire blockchain, and reinstalling Bitcoin-QT, I kept getting the corrupted data error at some point.
I downloaded Electrum (a thin client -- it doesn't have to download the entire chain. It just connects to a server that has the entire chain already synced), moved all my coins to that wallet, and have been very happy with it so far.

Most of it was 3D modeling and 3D animation. Something like Maya, 3D Studio Max, Lightwave, or my favorite -- Cinema4D.
3D animation and motion graphics are a ton of fun, but one doesn't simply "fairly easily whip one together."
Tons of modeling, composition, thought, planning and rendering went into that sequence. It's very well done.
Cinema4D is my 3D suite of choice. It's quite robust, and dead easy to learn the interface. If you want to get serious about motion graphics, check it out.

The early adopters will reap some good profits, but the difficulty will rise pretty quickly, and your 7 ghash miner will eventually become obsolete. Those who want to continue to make BTC from mining are the ones who will be constantly upgrading and adding to their mining operation.

Pretty cool gift. I keep trying to tell my family members about BTC, but they insist it's some sort of fake toy money with no real value. I've thought about giving each of them a small bit of BTC for Christmas, just so they'd have some sort of interest when they hear about it on the news. Where did you get those cards? Did you make them?
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:31:01
Yeah. Their whole tone during this little AMA has left a bad taste in my mouth. Looked like they were just trying to get the word out there to cap off their indiegogo campaign, rather than take the time to give legitimate answers to good questions.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:42:27
No. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:04:43
You could try, sure. But you'd also want to make sure you're removing the chain state and all the associated blocks from your computer. So long as you keep the wallet.dat file that you know has coins in it, it doesn't matter what happens to anything Bitcoin-Qt has downloaded. You will need a current, synced wallet to use the coins in the wallet, but, that wallet.dat file is the key to the addresses within.
Do you know which addresses you would have sent them to from your miner?
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:37:01
They may still be there -- I really have no idea. They were hacked, and a lot of accounts were subsequently showing incorrect balances.
I logged into my account recently, which previously had less than 0.01 BTC in it, only to see 418 BTC sitting there after months of zero mining.
Even if your coins are safe with them at the moment, who knows when they'll be back online, and processing legit payouts.
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:41:42
That wallet.dat file in that file location is the one Bitcoin-Qt loads. If it's saying there's nothing in it, then you may have the incorrect wallet.dat file.

1) IP addresses aren't stored in the blockchain.
2) Let me somewhat retract my previous statement. *Yes* it is possible, but very unlikely. It would require a lot of work on somebody's behalf, and even then, a lot of it would be guess work, I would assume.
3) People can receive bitcoins without ever being connected to the internet.

If you listen carefully at night, you can hear my CPU laughing as kicks back at 0% usage across all cores -- sipping drinks, and watching my GPU sweat it out, endlessly grinding away for that precious BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-02 06:23:01
This is what has kept me mining and grinding. I'm a huge internet/tech/computer geek, and I heard about btc a couple years ago -- even did some mining. At the time I thought it was nothing more than an online-only currency with no real world value. I thought it was just an alternative to using your credit/debit card online, providing nothing more than a convenience. I never could have guessed that it would flourish into what it is now.
Now I see the value in it all -- whole bitcoins, fractions of bitcoins. I'm close to exchanging some USD into btc, and just letting it sit for a few years to see what happens with it. I'm not about to put every penny I have in it, but wouldn't mind putting some **disposable** income into it -- income I could live without if the market crashed. I could lose a few hundred dollars, no biggie. But if that few hundred dollars could drastically improve my financial situation in the long run, then it's definitely worth it.
Interesting times these are, that's for sure.

If I recall correctly, they were recently hacked, and all payments have been frozen, and who knows how many coins were stolen.
There could be a good chance that your coins are gone forever. They haven't really revealed any details about the hack, or just how much was stolen. Who knows where those coins are. Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.

Don't think it has anything to do with syncing the entire chain. It creates the wallet.dat file as soon as you open it, regardless of its chain state.

I don't know the answer to that question. You need to round up as many wallet.dat files as you can find and try placing them in C:\Users\xxxx\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\ one at a time to see what they say.
Beyond that, there's a good chance that file is gone forever.
