Aaaahhh, what the hail:

That's great news! 
But what would make it better would be paper wallets for Medici assets - designed like the old-fashioned bond &amp; stock certificates. 
It may sound antediluvian, but having physical certificates has made me stop and think before selling. They as a choice induced me to buy more carefully, too: for the long term.

Glad to, and thanks yourself for the tip. We'll get through it.
Speaking of dives into history, check this out:

One part that baffled me is the drafter sounding like he wandered in from the U.S. Department of Justice. If the real intent is to nip another Mt. Gox in the bud, wouldn't it have been more appropriate to sound like he had wandered in from the Securities and Exchange Commission?

Mandatory if you're going to skirt the law that way. The IRS has been doing "net worth audits" for decades.

Thanks! I was wondering when DOGE would finally get one.
[So there we go...we can get along after all!]

What happened? Keyboarding the following words have actually made my latent anger vanish, replaced by a kind-of wistful sadness:
Good ol' Ben went to ground. He fell to his natural level.

Oh hell, yeah. The classic arc of the rogue trader who busts a bank or financial institution starts off with the fellow thinking he's a trading genius. Then, he gets the idea that he can get a promotion or added bonus by making a few "under the table" trades with company capital. And, when they start to go wrong, he hides those trades "under the desk" and falls into the double-or-nothing death spiral. 
According to Bernie Madoff, he began his Ponzi scheme because his split-strike strategy fell apart in 1990. Instead of winding it down and returning the clients' money, he converted it into his Ponzi scheme and lived a lie for almost two decades thereafter.

Congrats: you just nailed the classic Enlightenment argument for democracy: better a peaceful change of power than a violent one.

Good point. The so-called "war" is more like an internecine squabble. When it comes down to the bigger picture, it's the crypto world vis-a-vis the conventional monetary system. And crypto is (in many ways still) the oddball. 
From the standpoint of mainstream commenters at Zero Hedge [  ] the DOGE-BTC spat is like an inmate food fight in an insane asylum.  You want to join a "war," feel free to jump in and help ol' Fonestar. 
And as for "mainstream commenters" at ZH? In the normal everyday financial world, they're be looked on as dotty and conspiracy-minded. And of course, in the everyday world, hard-core finance is an acquired taste. 
It's not turtles all the way up, but this thumbnail telescoping does show that the Bitcoin-Dogecoin bumptiousness is pretty microscopic all told. If you don't have grey hair yet, the above perspective shot can be calming.

Yeah, that's pretty much it. If there's any upside, this state o' affairs gives us the perfect retort to a feminista who flings the accusation, "You're protective and controlling!"
The retort: "Do you mean I can't compete with your protective and controlling government?"

Something to keep your eye on. If the tech matures, it'll be fantastic news for all cryptocurrencies.

Oh, so it's a Canadian table them!

Welcome to economics after the marginalist revolution :)
To be frank, a lot of junior-gold penny stocks could see their bid stack blown to zero by a $100,000 dump. Temporarily.

Hail Fed! :o)

This latest Gox disaster reminded me of something Robert Heinlein wrote, about maturity in the frontier. Don't have the quote, but he said something like a mature person, when he finds his log cabin has burned down, just quietly starts clearing away the charcoal and builds another one. 
What counts in the frontier is stoicism. 
A musical take on the same point:
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:37:52
But did the desk thank you for apologizing? :-)
@_date: 2015-05-18 16:28:03
BURST and Qora.
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:24:31
Both of you are right.
