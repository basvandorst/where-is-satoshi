This is terrible advice. Just write down the 2FA restore code and keep it safe.

So can you use a legacy address to send to segwit and vice versa? How to do convert legacy to segwit? What happens if you have a segwit adress and send btc to an exchange that does not support segwit?

I am not against taxes for capital gains. However I just wish there was an easy way to calculate, pay tax on the spot, or have an exchange do it as a service. Right now its the wild west in terms of the taxes. I try my best to keep track but its hard when you move money between exchanges/coins/USD. It damn near impossible.

This comment is extremely ignorant. If he wants to blow 100K on traveling the world and that brings him happiness then great. Just because you know some old people who regret doing something 99% of the world cannot do, well then that's just sad.

This is why I never claim any forked coins until Ledger supports it in a user friendly way. Can't trust the internet.
Sorry OP.

BTC is choking? How? Everybody's joking now
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:12:37
I agree, traveled in thailand for a few weeks blowing money recklessly. Spent 3k tops lol. You could easily make that money last 3 months. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:05:37
Traveling to you may be crap, to someone else it may be their life long dream. No reason to shit on it or "warn him". If he was talking about buying drugs then you may have a valid argument. Let the man live.

If my math is correct last BTC will be mined in 2140. So you were born in 2052? If so how are things going?

Any time you setup up 2fa there is a restore code usually next to the QR code. It tells you to back it up and keep in a safe place. If you lost your 2fa for whatever reason the vendor must reset it internally. It is only available to the user upon setup of 2fa.
Coinbase needs to reset it for you. Important to keep in mind when getting/losing a phone. Those backup codes are critical to having access to your accounts. I never wrote them down and got a new phone. Before I wiped it I realized all my 2fa codes were missing on the new phone.  I had to go and one by one disable all 2fa then re-enable. This is when I learned the importance of those codes. If I wiped my phone I would have been fucked because I have 2fa on literally everything. Even my spam email :)

Roger Ver called out AA for not being a BTC millionaire because he’s a shallow POS. Andreas responded by - he had to take care of his family and pay rent at the time.
Then the BTC community sent him many donations with one guy sending over $500k to Andreas.

I will only spend BTC on something that itself will hold value aka a house down payment .

If I had my BTC stored on coinbase during the fork, then moved it to my Ledger Nano S yesterday, will I have BCH on Coinbase on Jan 1? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:25:43
so you are telling me real estate does not hold value, while possibly also generating income?

In for screenshots. Tough to believe you bought 92 btc in 2011 then forgot about it, but own more crypto now (without remembering your original btc) and have been on reddit 6 weeks...

Thank you.

coinbase also has a recurring purchase feature. I do $25 a week.
