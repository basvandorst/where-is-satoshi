Well,  if the concern is tampering:  then perhaps the unit was modified in a way that will not be discovered by the integrity self-check.   e.g.  Rogue microkernel that virtualizes the flash resource.  A spurious/extra circuit installed on the board outside the firmware that detects initialization then surreptitiously overwrites the freshly-generated key material with static values,  etc, etc.

That's not a fair comparison,  because outside of Testnets and private environments,   only Bitcoin has enough real-world use where congestion of access to put transactions on the chain could be a concern.
However; Litecoin  or Bitcoin Cash can have more than 2X the transaction volume that is currently causing Bitcoin users major grief **without nearly this level of congestion occurring**.

Until you get a major player using your system who is a massive exchange and doesn't care about what fees are required / just lumps in a generic 200 - 400 sat/byte flat fee to make sure THEIR transactions get in the chain --- with enough TX to fill up the 8MB blocks, and bills the extra cost to the customer.

A hard fork is not necessary,  as a phase-in approach could be used...  (1) Update the code to accept larger blocks as valid  after block   and signal support.    No fork occurs just to permit larger blocks....    (2)  Once a sufficient percentage of the network supports the larger blocks,  miners can  modify their code to start generating larger blocks.

You can simply look at the transactions occurring on the blockchain, to easily see that a large amount of commerce is not occurring,  AND  the volume of payments is NOTHING like something such as Paypal.
Your implication that Bitcoin is being used more than PayPal is one of the most absurd and hilarious propositions i've seen in the year 2017.




How do you figure?    If you go to an exchange to buy some crypto,  that fiat money does Not disappear ---  the cryptocurrency exchanges still require bank accounts to hold their fiat,  and the bank can still lend out money the fiat exchange has on deposit....


The "Market cap"  of Bitcoin is a highly-misleading figure:  It is a synthetic number that comes from multiplying the current price of 1 BTC prevailing on the exchanges By the number of Bitcoin in existence,   BUT  it fails to take into account that the bulk of Bitcoins in existence didn't move after being mined,  and MANY MANY  Bitcoins are in cold storage  or not being presented to market  --
 which is perfectly legal,  but means it is misleading that many coins are considered "part of the market"  which are simply not being made available for sale on exchanges,  likely at any price..
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:21:45
In a sense this is what banks do.... they lend money into existence,  and if ever ALL the depositors wanted their money back,  the bank  would become insolvent within  a day.    The only difference is banks don't claim to have 100% of their deposits available as cash for  payment on demand ---  they openly admit they can lend out 10X of  the amount you deposit to borrowers.

Selling to cut your losses is only good if have a reason for suspecting more losses ahead  other than being disappointed by recent performance ----  in other words,  you learned something that fundamentally changes your position on the future of the thing, 
 OR you were making a short term trade with specific technical criteria involved,   and  the price you observed  showed you that you were wrong and need to back out.

I'm not so sure.... even if you have a whole Bitcoin;  $115K would not be enough to assure very early retirement, even if the tax were 0.    Something tells me  just having 1 BTC is huge and Not a whole lot of people here have more than that, let alone more than 10 BTC.
Suppose you're 30 years old; To replace a middle class income of say $30K  with a relatively "safe"  (according to the government) fixed-income investment yielding 2.5%....  for the INTEREST to replace your income without eroding principal, you need  $1.2 Million fiat equivalent after taxes to retire,  or you would conventionally,  that means you need about  14 BTC at $115K per BTC.
If you keep most of that in BTC; it could in theory lose value relative to fiat and other crypto, so your retirement is never guaranteed...  on the other hand,  if you convert it into fiat,  then its  purchasing power will be cut in half every 25-28 years by inflation.
So what that tells you is you might be able to schedule a short retirement,  with a risk of it being abruptly cut short,  but the maximum probability of success being to hold a **mixture** of Fiat and BTC that you keep balanced.

It is not that predictable.  Look at these [inflation charts]( on Shadowstats.
Over the past 20 years the inflation has varied from 1% to 8%  on any given year,  with an average of approximately 5%.
5% annual inflation amounts  to the spending power of money in your bank accounts being **cut in half**  every 14 years;   Also,  these days it's very unlikely you got a 5% or more average raise from your employer per year,   so the Inflationary tendency  is a tax stealing purchasing power out of working class peoples'  pockets and putting them in the pockets of  highly wealthy individuals and corporations who can use capital to produce a high rate of return for themselves ---  basically a reverse-robinhood affect designed into the system to steal from the poor and middle class and give to the rich and to the financial "experts" (bankers and professional investors).
That 50% loss of value every 15 years is a major ding most people have every right to be extremely upset by.

Of course they know enough to broadcast a valid block, they're mining.

1GB blocksize seems a bit outlandish.   They still need SegWit unless they want to totally re-invent the wheel here;  also,  Bitcoin Cash still has no fix for the covert ASICBOOST security vulnerability in its Proof of Work....
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:58:56
Segwit holds a lot of potential,  but right now the main advantage is securing against ASICBOOST,  and it's a compatibility nightmare.   Go ahead and move your wallet to a new Bech32 SegWit address.....  And lose the ability  to send/receive  Bitcoin from your favorite exchanges,  because your sends and receives are now in a NEW Format  that other peoples' wallets don't support and won't support for years,  and maybe some will never support, a  **Per-Wallet Hard Fork**,   Instead of a simple  phased hard fork of the chain that would've pushed EVERYONE to  support a larger basic blocksize by a specified date,  fsck that....
So the BTC developers wound up doing what amounts to a complicated per-wallet hard fork that offers more theoretical benefits  (which have yet to have fully materialized)   WITHOUT also doing the simple limit bump that they ought to have.
I regard this as  somewhat of a failure/fiasco.   The final client implementation of SegWit isn't even available yet,  and  the user experience is thus so poor......   SegWit is so complicated major services such as CoinBase    have to put it off for months and months due to the complexity  of  the change in how payments are recorded and verified with SegWit   versus a SIMPLE  size bump.

Bitcoin was always publicly available.  Facebook was not always publicly traded,  so  we don't have charts for their initial business growth.   Things don't KEEP growing in size at massive rates like 1500%  after they reach a certain level of maturity growth -  after the business is mature in 10 years or so, growth tends to even out,  BUT it happens many companies grow a lot at the early stages of a new business and technology:   Facebook started out the size of a spec  and wounded up one of the largest technology companies of the US,  and that involved some SERIOUSLY massive growth rates  much larger cumulative growth over a short time than BitCoin has seen.
Generally a startup like Facebook will remain PRIVATELY held  until the vast majority of exponential or parabolic growth the business has ever seen has already happened and passed ----  It would be foolish for investors to start selling some of their shares at such an early stage,  And instead then, AFTER the initial growth phase: the early investors expect to sell out to enjoy the massive profit of their 100 to 1000%+  annual growth over the company's early years, 
 and a common exit strategy to get the early investors and let the venture capitalists or other funders take their profit out is to go public with an IPO, so that the investors can sell some of their stock to an unsuspecting public.
By the time of the IPO the vast majority of growth a startup will get is done with,  and you can expect less than 100% annual growth.
At some point Facebook went from 1 user to  1 billion   in 13 years,  And there's  NO POSSIBLE WAY that happened without massive growth rates like 10000%  during some years.
You could alternatively say on day 1 of their IPO many companies rose from less than $1 a share to their opening price which would be 100000%+ growth in a day.

The developers can bump a code update that will implement the increase to maximum block size  after a sufficient number of nodes on the network  report support.
After 100% of the nodes are updated,  then the block size can be seamlessly increased without any fork ----   Or,  whenever say  60 or 70% of the nodes  get updated to the new code,   the update can be made as a  non-contentious fork that should be short-lived.

Not all failures in a distributed system are fail-crash.   The Bitcoin network is failing, because transactions are not completing in a reasonable amount of time  without an excessively high fee attached.
A reasonable time is less than 1 hour.    When you want to go buy something using your BTC  the merchant will typically use a provider that locks in the  BTC/USD price for conversion for a limited amount of time,  and more than  30 minutes or so  wait and your transaction will be declared as failed,   And they'll be trying to refund you  (with another large network fee,  that you the consumer will be paying for the failed TX).

It's not gambling: it is speculation,  because people are buying the asset not making a binary bet.
E.G.  They're not placing a bet on the horse race,  they're going to the horse owner and purchasing the right to a share of their horse's lifetime winnings.
Buying property,  whether it's real property or intangible  in the belief and/or hopes  that its current price is cheap  and  it can later be sold for more  is   speculation.
The key difference between Gambling and Speculation,  is ultimately  the value that the asset will have is not primarily about random chance but will be determined  by a market  that should eventually be rational,  and the buyer has  some kind of thesis,   so whether they will profit or not is eventually determined by the marketplace.
Ultimately the market price is not considered random,  even though it can be difficult or impossible to predict reliably ----  there are people who predict with more accuracy than random chance or than in gambling games.

You would have to,  otherwise you couldn't expect anybody to be interested in buying it --- since the ONLY value the product has is its ability to "generate money";   If you are in the business of profiting from selling hardware,   then you should expect to sell that at a considerable discount to what they could generate  in order to lock in your own profits  and limit your business risk.
Also, the amount of money "it could generate"  is theoretical --- uncertain.   There is always the risk that over the lifetime of the product that its theoretical potential won't be realized,  Or  cryptocurrency volatility or changes in network difficulty could devalue the output --- difficulty tends to increase over time lowering 
 the potential value of operating the product,  so it behooves the manufacturers of new mining ASICs to move those products to consumers as soon after their manufacture as possible.
Reliability is a big deal with this type of equipment though,  so 
 "burn-in testing" is essential.

Exactly....   I would affirm this is a useful observation / piece of information to have.... if you believe in the long-term future of the Bitcoin blockchain as a store of value --  as it could suggest when the price moves significantly below 1.4X the SMA,  this measure suggests it would be a huge buying opportunity,  whereas,  when the price is  1.5X or higher,  then it's probably not the best time to buy and may be better to sell some --- even if there is what looks like or appears to be a dip on the chart.

That's a difference between PHYSICAL gold and Bitcoin.

This isn't a sound basis for such a major change, however.   That's like the idea of randomly adding a second lane to a road, because right now we have frequent traffic congestion --- it's a lot of construction,  AND the small increase in capacity will attract more traffic rapidly leading to the same issue again: since it  is already known to not be scaleable without more complicated  systemwide changes that come from developers' planning process. 
The mempool is congested mostly as a symptom of unexpected and sudden hype ----   IF   the blocksize gets increased,  then the Bitcoin network basically has to live with that decision including its potential negative ramifications forever;   meanwhile SegWit has been added which enables the Lightning Network's  core technology,  and it's just a matter of time before that completes and provides Bitcoin users a scalable efficient way to transact in larger volumes.

Why?   If  I had bought $1000 at $10/BTC....   I would probably have opted to sell 10% of its USD value at $100  (Recovering my $1000),   10% at $1250  (putting $12,000 in my pocket),  10% at 10000 (putting $100K in my pocket),  and still have 70 BTC  now worth  $800K.
Unfortunately,  I was too risk averse to even deal with those overseas exchanges,  so  I never obtained enough BTC to really achieve any significant fiat-value in terms of profit  a  400%  gain on  $50  while giving me some extra spending power  will never  be able to make me wealthy.

Paying it off does NOT guarantee this,  because natural disasters happen all the time and can easily render a house unlivable,  AND your money is then locked up tight in the property.      What you need to get a roof over your head under such conditions is called emergency cash,  not paid-off debt.
Getting your investment back from a lost/now-unlivable house takes a lot of time and effort,  assuming you have it insured ----  the insurance companies will typically fight you and try to minimize, deny, or delay any payouts every step of the way,  so after 6 to 12 months you can expect some % of the money back  necessary to get a new roof,  BUT  these things take time.
Maintaining a well-protected reserve of sufficient cash will do a LOT more to protect you than having any particular debt paid off.
As for the debt itself becoming a risk -- well, the idea is to recognize if you can no longer afford the mortgage as early as possible and pivot / change things so you can.
If you keep some cash,  then you can ALWAYS find and rent a new lower-cost place,  just make sure you kept enough to tide you over for the time it takes to sell.

Well,  that's asking for trouble in a way;   people would likely have a FAR better time  NOT  putting anything into crypto you don't intend to leave as crypto forever,  OR  cash out by buying goods from crypto-supporting merchants  instead of Via exchange ----  because the AML laws require the banks to understand what SOURCE the money is coming from that goes into accounts of customers for  withdrawal/payment from and report suspicious activity --  and  many traditional banks are likely to decide ANY incoming crypto sales proceeds are suspicious  activity,  because.... how is your bank going to show   that you didn't materialize that crypto received in your Coinbase wallet from a drug deal, embezzlement,  or other illegal action?    When Coinbase can't even ID/trace the source of the actual funds  for what users deposited and then sold on CB?

Bittorrent in general uses uTP,  AND when Bittorrent DOES use TCP:  the protocol does NOT use TCP for file transfers in the same way that Bitcoin or HTTPS or FTP uses TCP,  As such  Bitcoin blocks DO NOT HAVE THE SAME MEANING as BitTorrent blocks,  they are completely different non-comparable things;   BECAUSE  in a typical Bittorrent scenario there are  3 or 4 seeders trying to distribute a 200-Gigabyte file to 1000 leechers,  AND they will deliberately restrict speeds and how many "File blocks" a leecher can retrieve in a given time frame  before artificially limiting both the transfer speed and the number of requests.      To maintain EFFICIENCY for the file distribution;   all the clients will intentionally throttle access to all the leechers and time-slice the  downloads  using a Ratio-based quota system based on the **File blocks**,  and this is what causes timeouts -- since a "File block" is the smallest unit of Transfer for a large file you expect to finish transferring in BitTorrent   -----   the Bittorrent protocol itself is BUILT ON the uploading node deliberately causing download timeouts often  and  requiring  as many nodes as possible to co-operate  before downloaders are allowed to get the seeded blocks from the hive.
The Bitcoin network has No such thing.   **BLOCKCHAIN BLOCKS**  are  not   a **basic unit of transfer scheduling**  on the Bitcoin network;    The  Bitcoin network  is not designed at all like Torrent,  
 because its purpose is NOT to transfer large files from a few seeders to Many leechers And   limit each leecher's download sums  ----  Except when a brand new full node is being setup,   Bitcoin is not very chatty and there is very little data to download,  you would be literally talking  1   8-megabyte chunk of data every 10 to 25 minutes.
Arguably the individual transactions that are NOT yet in a block utilize a whole lot more bandwidth  than when a new block's headers are being distributed and nodes are required to  piece together the various available information to construct a local copy of the block identical to what has been mined and matches the received blockhashes.




The Bitcoin protocol does not use distributed hash tables or trackers for content distribution like BitTorrent does,  because the primary purpose of Bitcoin nodes is NOT  large file distribution  or discovery of download trackers/download coordinators;   the purpose and implementation of the protocols are very different..










This is NOT something a Bitcoin node does.   EITHER the transaction you need to retrieve is New and not in a block yet  (Mempool or Relay set),  and the network distributes these transactions  as the basic element of transfer.
OR the transaction is in a historical block,  AND all  nodes on the network  constructed and saved the historical blocks in memory,  And retained the indexes of transactions still interesting to that node.




Nodes ultimately need all data they request,  so there's no 7 MB being discarded to get at  1MB.

The answer is NO.   Bitcoin is a transformative technology that is going to bring a LOT of value to the world in the long run if it catches on.   SOME of the people in the community are also excited  that the sudden financial community hype has highlighted a chance to enrich some individuals who bought in early: in the short run.
These are the early adopters who had to take on some risk though to be in a position to have a chance at that reward.  BY THE WAY:  You're still an early adopter if you start obtaining crypto from an earlier user and using cryptocurrency today for transactions.




Greed has been highlighted, but it's not the only thing.   Greed exists with the fiat system too,  but it's the bankers enriching themselves  instead of the common people.
All I could say is greed is PART of it,  and we should direct some attention to the other benefits of crypto too and encourage people to experiment and explore using only $$$ they can afford to lose.

Well, his loss is by reducing gains.    If you owned BTC before the fork: It was not necessary to bet on which one would succeed BTC or BCH --- you could simply have held the coins on both sides of the fork.
His choice was to gamble that BCH would be winner,  and if he was right  (It's not yet proven that he was wrong -- BCH being at $1K  technically could be temporary) his future gains  could  double,  if he was wrong he could potentially lose almost the entire investment.
He did that bet on black gamble and so far is wrong,  but if his conviction has been shaken,  then at least it wasn't too late to walk away with some overall positive ROI....    BCH could very well  could be at  ($0K)  or $15K,   with BTC at $0 or $15K.

Well,  I would suggest two additional protocol rules.
(1) Disincentive miners from failing to fully populate a block --   For a block to be valid: Up to 90% of the transaction fees and 50% of the miner reward have to be  burned/discarded/sent to a pre-defined address  based on a sliding scale  if a block is presented that contains less than  500 KB to 1MB in transactions,  AND a future miner who next mines a block that is 2MB or larger in size can claim 10% of funds at the pre-defined address.
(2) Chop up sections of the block maximum for example: 8MB into  6 "fee" tiers:    0k -  499k,  500k - 1MB,  1 - 2MB,  3 - 6MB,  and 7 - 8 MB.
Created augmented rules about a  MINIMUM Allowed fee for a transaction to populate each section of the block;  thus spam transactions have to meet fee minimums to cause blocks to expand.   If the fee is LESS than a pre-defined threshold,  than that transaction  cannot populate that part of the block.
for example:
Tier 1 -   Minimum fee:   0 Sat/Byte.
Tier 2 -   Minimum fee:   10 Sat/Byte.
Tier 3 -   Minimum fee:   25 Sat/Byte.
Tier 4 -   Minimum fee:   50 Sat/Byte.
Tier 5 -   Minimum fee:   100 Sat/Byte.
Tier 6 -   Minimum fee:   150 Sat/Byte.

What? No...  Money comes "out of thin air" all the time.   You're NOT required to  JUSTIFY  how you got money;  that's not the IRS' job.   The IRS job would be  to identify if you generated Cash out of thin air and didn't report any income,  because obviously that would be fraud.
Just REPORT the money you generated from "thin air" as income.   If you cannot confidently establish the cost basis,  then report the cost basis as $0,  and there will be nothing to audit,  OR  show only costs you can prove you paid.

Just a thought:  Because it is secured debt: mortgage is some of the LOWEST interest-rate debt one can get.    GOOD DEBT is debt where the interest rate is low and you took out the debt to make investments expected to yield a return higher than the rate of interest you pay ---  which makes it really attractive to take on this kind of debt to  provide leverage for making other investments, ASSUMING you can afford the payments.
Home equity is high-risk value that yields a low rate of return on its own  and is difficult to earn money off of without taking on a mortgage and  investing the proceeds.
In short:   If  I owned a house,  the thing to consider doing is to mortgage it  and  use the proceeds to make  well-diversified investments  expected to have a higher return than the rate of interest being paid to the bank.
Cashing out 100% of Bitcoin holdings  to eliminate that free equity sounds like one of the worst possible things  to do,   that is assuming  the mortgage payments are not unaffordable to you, and you have a steady job with  necessary insurance  and 6 months emergency cash in case something should happen.

There is only 1 state where this is the couple's decision:  Alaska is an opt-in state.    Otherwise,  if you live in a community property state,  then the couple is an entity and all money and property earned from business or acquired while you are married and any earnings from investment on community property is legally owned by the couple;  that's a 50% / 50% ownership.
So if your Wife only works part time, and you work a full time job for $100k.   That's 100k a year  Plus your wife's earnings legally owned equally by both husband and wife.
It's quite meaningless to speak of "your money",  or "her money,  because  technically all the money belongs to both of you,   and if you decide to invest your share in Bitcoins while you're still married --- any earnings on the BTC are equally owned by both,  and  a share of the  income goes on both of your tax returns if you are filing separately.
If you want to agree as a couple  to  informally subdivide the earnings and assign designated personal spending to each partner and put a partner in charge of most  "house spending",  or  set a  "rule of decency"  requiring approval by both partners for major  spends ----  you can  do all those things.     However,  **legally**  speaking,  you can't make the restriction ---  there is no  "his money"  or  "her money"    other than  premarital assets  that were never comingled.

This is true, BUT  the concept of agreeing upon a futures contract can be used to offset risk,  which can enable more people to hold BTC,  which can indirectly affect the supply....
For example if person A buys  10000 BTC  at $12,000  and sells  2000 Futures Contracts (for 5 BTC each) to deliver those coins before X date in the future with a maximum price change of +/- $1000....    then person A  can  continue to hold those 10000 BTC  with reduced market risk --  their loss will be capped at 10 Million$ if the price of 1 BTC will decrease more than $1000,  then all the risk of the price dropping by more than $1000 is born by the buyer of the contract  if the maximum price change was by +/- 1000,   on the other hand if the price of that 1 BTC increases  above $13,000 then the gains will go to the buyer of  the contract,   thus the seller has given away any gains above 10 million.
That's  10000 BTC  that could be held with reduced risk which COULD  increase the demand for BTC.
Now we'll need to further analyze the details of the specific kinds of futures they plan on offering  to see what kind of hedging and speculation they are actually enabling.

There's no reporting form for  moving an asset from one account or location to another,   So long  as you either own both accounts,  Or  if you don't own the recipient account - if the transfer was  a gift for which no consideration was received (A person receiving a gift of BTC  inherits the  cost basis that the giver had,  and the tax liability).

You are correct in that this rate of growth cannot continue forever, BUT that doesn't mean the growth is close to over.   Early investors/venture capitalists in a private company before it sells to a public company or goes IPO, for example,  typically expect to see  total gains representing growth on the order of 2000%  --- by the time a company is publicly tradeable the parabolic growth is gone and the growth is smoothing out:  Taking a company public is the EXIT strategy of the early investors to cash in on their profits.
Remember, there was a time when Facebook's market cap was less than a million bucks,  and  today it's  over 500 billion,  more than 5000% in growth ----  in fact,  that's  more growth and at a higher rate than we've seen with Bitcoin.
The way Bitcoin is different:  Is it's NOT a company, but a technology itself,  AND we get to see its price from the very beginning,  because It starts public ---  "Going public" for Bitcoin is NOT an exit strategy to collect profits,  since it's public, equal access, and open source from the start.
Also I don't agree that "250 billion market cap" or a specified number of months is when this settles ----  exponential growth for a time is NORMAL in the early stages of adoption for a technology or a company,  AND  cryptocurrency technology has not even been adopted by 1% of the population,  so far.
Bitcoin has the potential as a technology to be adopted by FAR MORE people and be associated with FAR more economic activity than Facebook,  therefore it reasons that if Facebook is worth 500 Billion,    then Bitcoin as a technology could eventually be worth something like  10 times as much as Facebook, or say  5 Trillion.

No.... there's always a chance during the highly volatile period that you got unlucky and purchased at a local maximum;  whether you ultimately have a gain or not will depend primarily on whether your thesis was correct about the trend though.
People cope with high short-term volatility by  making sure not to buy their entire initial investment at the same price....  for example:  If time horizon is   36 months and you have $75K total to put in,  then people divide that lump sum such as into  8    $9,3750  investments   to be put in  twice a month  over a period of 3 months

[Escheatment](   Frankly....  As a person who received gifts of stock shares as a kid that would've been worth a hell of lot of $$$ today  in 10000% appreciation + dividends AND  lost them all to the state:   Basically stolen from me by the state we had lived in when I was a baby,  because the custodian failed to update my mailing address with the company's transfer agent  long before my 18th birthday.

Cashing out in US dollars produces the capital gain.    If you mined the coins yourself  your cost basis is  $0 +  (Proportion of Mining Expenses corresponding to the sold or traded coins).
Because  the guidance is BTC is property;  I believe a common treatment that miners will be using is that no income occurs until after they sell their BTC or transact with their BTC.
This is just the same as building and selling any piece of manufactured property  ---  you build X widget that will be worth $Y,   but the $Y is not income until you sell it.

First of all: if you have unrealized losses.... you can't declare them and deduct them;  you have to sell the units you have unrealized losses on  to make that a realized loss, before the IRS allows you to actually declare that amount of capital loss. 
Second of all:  While it probably doesn't apply to cryptocurrencies --- if the asset is a security,  Buying back the Asset you just sold  within 30 days before OR after the sale disqualifies you from claiming the loss by something called the Wash Sale rule,  and the loss is deferred by increasing the cost basis of what you just bought to include the total disallowed loss.

So what?  Torrent transfer blocks/piece sides are totally unrelated to Bitcoin protocol...  For starters,  Bitcoin uses TCP to transfer data not UDP,  and the reliable transport layer decides at what rate to send data;   the information you are citing is totally irrelevent ---   what works well as a transfer block size/piece size  for achieving maximum throughput and minimal resends when sending large files over BittTorrent has zero relationship to what works well as a  Bitcoin  blockchain entry size.
We don't use totally unrelated systems to say what other protocols can do.    For example:   We don't look at  Bitcoin and find that blocks larger than 16MB don't work nicely,  and therefore  restrict the Torrent protocol from being able to download/upload a file larger than 16 MB.

Providing additional capacity that cannot be taken up by dust transaction spammers has the benefit of providing larger blocks and not seeing the additional space capacity be used so frivolously.
The problem is:  the current system of miners choosing transactions has proven not robust in actual practice BECAUSE the miners seem to be complicit with the spammers,   AND  now we should be trying to deal with miners who are trying to game the system by generating empty blocks  courtesy of attacks like  ASICBOOST.




Perhaps...   I suppose there should've been one more rule that miners can never claim  something like more than 70%  of the transaction fees in a single block --  that way there is **always** friction with every transaction on blocks larger than 500kb,  and a miner is guaranteed to lose money on fees from any junk transaction.

I would say that is a questionable position at best.
If the "mining" operation is a business,  for example you are running mining hardware as a service, and coins are received are fiat or cryptocoins people pay you in compensation for the service of running the miner,  then the property (coins) you receive, Or the cash you receive from immediately selling those coins  may be income.
On the other hand if you are running a machine (Bitcoin miner) that just happens to create property  Or cause ledger entries that will allow you to later redeem or spend some coins,  and you are letting your machine passively solve blocks -- not actually loading any keys or redeeming or spending any coins, and not running this miner in the course of a business (Not doing this in a business-like way or selling a good or a service to anyone else),  and you are not selling or trading the property,  then the property you  manufactured will not be income...
For example:  If you are a professional woodworker trained in a special japanese technique, and you hand-make some tables and other furniture for your own use that would have a fair market value of $5,000,000;   You  do not have to report a penny of that as income,   until such time as you  sell or dispense with  your self-made valuable personal property.

For tax purposes,  shorting forces you to immediate realize any deferred capital gains;  the IRS term for it is  "Constructive Sale" of the asset.    As soon as you enter into a contract or arrangement that lets you lock in the sale price, that's when the taxable event occurs.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:31:02
It's not just paperwork BS....   Paying taxes reduces the value of the capital you have available to invest and keep working for you.
For example: 
Consider this scenario.... you pay 25% tax on all capital gains.
You have a long-term investment worth $2000  which you got for free, so it has a cost basis of $0   and thus it is all gain.
Taxes due will be withheld from your sales of investments and go straight to the IRS  (In the real-world you would have to pay them in the next quarterly estimated taxes).
Let's say you have investment A which you KNOW for a fact will pay  6% a year for the next  4 years,  and you are considering moving to investment B which you feel in your gut will pay  8% a year for the next 4 years,  BUT it's a higher-risk issue with more potential benefit to society ---  Of course it has to be higher risk,  that's why the company had to justify it by showing they'll provide a higher return.
If you just left the $2000 in investment A,  Sell after 4 years, then  your balance will be   2000*(1.06^4)  - $631 =   You have $1,893.71   in cash  after  paying a total of $631 in taxes.
On the other hand, if you sell $2000 worth of investment A  today instead of holding it...  You lose $500 to tax ,  so you buy $1500 worth of investment B immediately,   your balance is
(1500*1.08^4)  = $2,040.73  after  4 years with a cost basis of $1500.
You sell Investment B for $2040.73 and realize $540.73 in capital gains....   $135.18  more in tax is due,   and you walk away with   $1,905.55  in after-tax cash in your pocket.
So you're only $12 richer than if you stayed in  investment A.
In other words, your  8% VS 6%  Return on investment translated into an additional  0.00006%  in your pocket, because of taxes.
The fact you'd have to realize taxes on your held gains when you sold completely destroyed a business opportunity  to try a higher-risk investment  that would be more likely to benefit the public.
It also means that holding a LARGE  amount of gains tax-deferred is kind of like  a nice way of artificially amplifying the return of your investment.
Your  6% investment became almost as good as a riskier 8% investment,  just because you're able to HODL and not sell early.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:06:17
The thing you need to realize is that after 30 years  the cumulative $180K will be worth a lot less than it is today,  because of inflation -- the amortized interest is a LOT lower than it sounds.    AND investing that $250K  into compounding interest can be a MUCH MUCH better deal  than  investing that $250K into paying off a low-interest loan early.
Particularly,  when the historical averages have stock market fund investments returning 8%,  or  10% or more (If you are lucky),  or  4 to 5% if you pick an unlucky stretch of years.
Assuming you have $250,000 in cash now,  you could pay off that loan today and  save that $180K in interest,  OR  you could invest that $250K in market index funds and bonds at a composite average return of  let's assume:  your return averages 5%  over 30 years,  then you have  $830,485   in profit after 30 years.
That $830,485 is a hell of a lot more $$$ than  $180K.
Now if you take on higher risk and you don't lose the money and you earn 10% average per year, well that $250K  will become $4,362,350,    for a  $4,112,350   in total long-term gain which is a hell of a lot more than  saving $180K in aggregate interest payments

Honestly; if you are 17 and you earned the money in question,  then  your parents' role in your personal accounts should be largely advisory or supportive only at this point;  this is your money, and the whole point is you get to decide -- as you're 
 mainly waiting on a legal formality.   If they have concerns,  then your parent should be advising you as an adult,  and it's unreasonable to be dictating everything to you this late in the game ---  If you are not getting treated with respect as an equal adult at age 17,  then you will very soon be in a position to counter that in a manner where you may both regret.
The fact you have your parents  "denying"  you some use/personal choice on your own money that has minimal bearing or legit. reason for them to have an opinion about would make me  very nervous of the security of any funds currently in a bank  account  that was opened with both your names on the account  ---  Do you trust your parents not to escalate a denial by taking money from your control soon or later?     How would they react if they learned some $$$ you spent was on an AltCoin  or Bitcoin  in spite of what they said?    Would your parents be likely to call the bank and tell them to wire the rest of the money out of your account?
Forget buying Bitcoins,  as  I would feel telling you "You can't spend 
 money on X"  rather than strongly advising not to with an explanation as a betrayal of trust....  I would quietly concentrate on looking at possible gradual "spend downs" of some kind,  or other transaction to get at least a portion of funds locked up in some manner  to make sure that  one of the parents cannot unilaterally take substantial money  earned/saved.
For example:  I wonder if you can setup some solely-owned prepaid cards or other item to lock funds onto, or hold cash,  or  ask your employer to pay you by solely-owned prepaid card(s) /  other methods the parents won't have much access to instead of a banking arrangement -- Cryptocurrency appropriately secured is one such arranagement  ---  I admit I am no expert in all the potential options and further research would be required,  especially regarding the costs and fees  of prepaid cards, etc,  But you can justify  having multiple prepaid debit cards  "For improved security and ability to spend online if needed"  ----  And a debit account may be usable to fund a small Bitcoin purchase  without appearing on the bank.
Some other questions that come to mind regarding security/privacy...   even if your parent is a Joint signer.. at Age 17; 
ideally you have made sure by now they de-facto do not touch your account,   and agree their signer status is for  "Emergency only/with your permission only".
Sec Question 1: Have you made sure that you are in sole possession of all banking/account opening documents,  All deposit slips, checks, debit cards, etc,  that were ordered,  especially anything with the account number,  and it's locked up -- preferably in a good strongbox only you have combinations to open?
Sec Question 2: Are your parents reading statements on your bank account?  Do they have access to your statements?   Obviously, this would seem unreasonably intrusive into your private business at this age, if so.
Have you turned off any paper statements and made sure  that the only e-mail addresses for online banking and only contact phone numbers for anyone on your account are your own phone number,  so if your parents call them the bank wouldn't recognize the home  phone number or the cell phone number,  nor be able to answer any security questions,  and your parents have no access to your e-mail accounts,  passwords, or phones,  And you have multiple  secure backups  local and remote?
Sec Question 3:  Is  your chosen bank one with no local branch?   Preferably it should be an online only bank you use primarily so a parent cannot walk in,  show a driver's license,  and  ask the teller  to give them your account IDs and credentials,  even if they are a Joint signer ---  Ideally, you want a long difficult process for anyone other than you to ID themself to  the bank.
Or a selected process Where you can do anything online,  but  withdrawals  by anyone else must be signed by all. 
Sec Question 4:  Do you have a prepaid cellphone plan of your own and device you paid for thus own, or some other arrangement where you pay for the cell phone from your own money and make sure only you have enough control of the cell phone and account to do a SIM Swap or Passcode unlock on the phone  to use the PH

Because the investor using the mortgage money to mass-buy $75K of BTC  at $19K/Unit was a very strong expression of **opinion**  that at SOME POINT between now and the end of your investment horizon period the buyer expects that the BTC units being purchased will have a worth at not only MORE than $19K/Unit but SO MUCH MORE as to deem the inherent risks worth it.
Given the volatility of BTC,  if you make a single large purchase of BTC on one date,  and have a very small investment horizon then you have a very HIGH chance of losing.
However, given the volatility of BTC, if you make a purchase and have a very LONG investment horizon before you need to spend the funds, such as a year or longer, or perhaps two years, then it is MUCH more probable that at some time during your investment period  the units of BTC will be worth $19K or more again,  so that you will have opportunities to sell at zero loss or a gain on your investment.
FOR EXAMPLE:  If you took this $75K mortgage back in 2016 and have been holding them for an entire year,  then you have a very high probability of having appreciated BTC that you could technically sell at a profit today.

You said they scammed 6 other people and got some of their remaining funds locked.   What's probably happening here is the scammer got away with SOME funds that LBTC's escrow service failed to capture,  and the scammers allegedly scammed multiple people,  so there might not even be enough locked funds in Localbitcoin's possession to fully repay everyone that was scammed,  and thus there might be no possible way EVERYBODY who was scammed is going to walk away happy in this case -- But there's no way they would want to admit that --- That is,  without Localbitcoins being held liable  to someone they can only partially repay.
 
Hence I'm pretty sure the best the parties can do is hire lawyers, and get formal civil proceedings going,  otherwise they are just going to continue trying to hide behind  "We require law enforcement order to return funds from a crime";   from your long history,  we can see very clearly they're deliberately stalling:  perhaps Localbitcoins is hoping some of you will forget the issue eventually or  they can stall long enough that statute of limitations protects them.

That does not mean the child no longer owns money in that amount --- that just means that either is allowed to withdraw or order the bank to pay.
If the parent spends the money without (and possibly even with) the child's permission,  then they are open to the possibility of being sued later  and having to demonstrate that they spent that amount of money (or more) for the child's benefit ----   as long as the parent has not withdrawn more money then they spent for the child's benefit,  then they can always have the court case dismissed as  "I paid $X on Y,Z legitimate expenses for the child,  and paid myself from the child's accounts to reimburse my expenses/costs.".
So this is only going to become an issue if the child earns and puts into their account _MORE_  money per year  than the parents spend on all appropriate expenses related to the child's needs  (Clothing, food, etc).

In other words: it would align the currency back towards even more strongly encouraging fiscally responsible spending behavior by consumers,  governments, and companies alike --- THAT IS NOT A NEGATIVE,  whereas  the current inflationary fiat system is insanely biased towards encouraging people to take on debts,  and thus funneling profits  to the banks:   profits that ought to be received by consumers in the form of retaining the value of their savings  ---  
the inflationary encouragement is likely a reflection of how fiscally irresponsible the government itself has become.
By the way,  in spite of losing money to interest payments on credit cards, people STILL take on debt to buy things  at irrational payment levels  And the majority of the public lose a bunch of money to the banks long-term even if the Fiat were not inflationary,   so  the argument that people would buy less of what they need if money were deflationary seems unfounded.
A deflationary unit of account would have the advantage of  helping to correct/fix the economy eliminating  rampant speculation bubbles such as those in  real-estate,   and other assets people  "borrow money for"  which have no merit;   you could expect  rents and other property prices to be lower and overall stable across the board

You missed the point I was reacting to:




If both of these statements are true, then that means there is no possible way to extract or transfer the bitcoins out of the paper.
As a consequence, That then implies two things....
(1) The holder of the paper never actually gains control of the Bitcoins ---  If you agree to pay me Bitcoins,  and I don't agree to accept suspicious pieces of paper, and you're holding one of these pieces of paper,  there is no way for you to meet your obligation to pay me.   There HAS to be a way to either obtain the private key or  a mechanism for spending the actual Bitcoin value on the paper for  them to be truly Bitcoins (even if  using that mechanism breaks a tamper-seal or otherwise destroys that note,  so that it is required to be evident some of its value could have been spent).
(2) With no way to extract the value from the paper: there's nothing to stop the creator from making 2 or 3 pieces of paper with the same public address,  or setting up a ruse where they control the private keys and will go back and gradudally all their value for themself 10 years later.   This would be very difficult to detect....   
(3) If you can't extract the Bitcoin value from the paper,  then it's really just fiat!

It's possible that ONE single banking failure could cause losses not only exhausting such small insurance fund  but exceed it by an order of magnitude.

You may get back your  $10000 bank balance,  BUT  there may be a 30 to 90-day or so delay where your $$$ is unavailable before they figure out what to do and that happens,  THEN by the time you get that $10k  it will have lost a  substantial percentage of  its purchasing power due to the government having to create new money to the tune of 3 to 4 trillion $$$, for a multiple bank failure.

First of all...  (1)  The reason to try to "crack" a particular private key used for a Bitcoin wallet
 would be in order to sign a fraudulent transaction to steal coins from that wallet.   While a CIA lab might work on cracking RSA and EC   asymmetric algorithms,  their reason for doing so would be to quietly decrypt communications for messages.
Cracking keys used by Bitcoin wallets in order to sign fraudulent transactions and create theft  are inconsistent with the CIA's goals, since:
(2)  Cracking multiple Bitcoin wallet keys would require wasting resources -- and for what?  Just to steal some money from various people?     The CIA  already gets however much money as they are authorized to handle from taxpayer funding.    The CIA is not a moneymaking organization,  they're not supposed to make or steal any money ---- every person within the CIA is also bound to follow the law,  and breaking or trafficking in encryption keys with the intention to further the commission of a crime would be illegal.
(3) Most Bitcoin wallets WON'T have billions of $$$ worth, so there won't be enough value in the wallet to be worth the cost of an enormous amount of computation power on a QC for a long amount of time required in order to break their key --- Each wallet is a DIFFERENT keypair,   so cracking one wallet or another does not actually break the entire network ---- just the one wallet you managed to crack.
(4)  Quantum Computing is not as big a vulnerability for BTC users -- Most wallets COULD NOT be attacked even by a  Million-Qbit Quantum Computer that could instantly break any keypair ----- knowing the wallet address is Not enough;  that wallet ALSO has to have signed a spend transaction,  revealing the public key that goes with that wallet in the process;  MANY wallets are only used Once and then emptied,  which actually provides one of the strongest possible protection against Quantum Computer Attacks on Symmetric Crypto:   Even the PUBLIC key is kept secret/not revealed to the Bitcoin network  until the wallet makes at least one outgoing transaction ---  MANY of the wallet addresses that contain coins have only  ever  RECEIVED Bitcoins and never spent any  - which means the world knows what the HASH of the Public key is,  but only the owner or person with the wallet seed knows the exact public key.   Quantum Computing  ONLY has an advantage trying to guess the Secret key  when you know the Public Key --- Quantum Computing DOES NOT allow you to effectively figure out a working keypair that  has a certain Bitcoin address,  unless you already know what that public key is:  You would be sadly out of luck,  even with an amazingly large Quantum Computer.
(5) Stealing money from wallets on the Blockchain would reveal that the cryptography has been broken which would reduce the value of  what the CIA developed  -----  The CIA is  MORE likely to use their lab to break asymmetric crypto AND  use the discovery only in their mission of intelligence gathering --  If they develop this capability early,  then it's sure to become a heavily-guarded secret,  and they wouldn't dare  using the capability in a way that risks revealing its existence to their adversaries ----  something so frivolous as stealing Bitcoins  would be just such a frivolous activity.
(6) Even with a non-commercially available quantum computer ---  using that compute power to crack keys not securing interesting communications would be a waste of that QP time which would instead be directed towards things like decrypting  PGP traffic.   Whatever QP is built in a lab  would be very expensive to build, and limited in number,   so naturally every second of time on the QP would need to get justified  --- especially after a lot of high-value jobs come in like breaking the keypairs securing other governments' communications.

Instead of using a 24-word seed... use a 24-word seed with some different ADDED  25th  custom words for your different wallets,  using the  [Advanced passphrase feature](
With just 24 words,  and an empty 25th is your  "Low value - everyday spending wallet"
Then you have other long passphrases for the 25th word  which you have committed 100% to memory   (It can be multiple words with special symbols, mixture of lowercase, etc).  
Make as many copies of the 24 seed words as you want and put them all over the place.    NONE of them can provide access to your high value wallet without knowing which 25th word to use,   And you can have other valid 25th words for the purpose of  "plausible deniability".
Basically, if someone threatens you and demands your passphrase:  you'll give them  passphrases,   but they'll provide access to low value wallets,  since  each different  25th-word passphrase   results in a different seed and thus a completely different set of wallets.

They don't "give it" to person B.    They have a pool of a large number of "Person As"   who deposit currency.
Then the banks put all the money into a shared pool -- and say  they Owe each Person A  that person's account balance.
So the Bank has two things of interest:  The  Total of all  Person A  (depositors') account balances,   that is the Total of the Bank's obligations to depositors,   AND then  the  Pile of   Cash  or Bitcoin or Bitconnect or Whatever the bank is holding   to meet the obligation  to  allow their depositors' to withdraw any portion of that depositors' funds on demand.
Then the next step:   The  bank can spend some of the pool of  money,   so they  no longer have enough money on hand to pay all their depositors --- in the event of the theoretically possible but unlikely situation that a significant number of depositors come to the bank demanding to withdraw all their funds  over a short period of time:  the bank will  not be able to deliver,  since it spent some of the money.
The common situation then is to  spend  the depositors'  money to make new investments,   but to leave behind a small fraction, E.g.  10% of deposits as currency kept behind, that's the  "Reserve" in  Fractional reserve,   and the Fraction is the relatively small fraction of the depositors'  funds that are actually  not spent.
Oh,  And the typical way of spending or investing Depositors'  cash is to loan it to other  people who will use it to buy something ---  and typically the loaned money will find its way back as a deposit to the same bank.
Rarely does actual cash ever need to be delivered,  as electronic payments and checks are common ---- which are just numbers in banks' accounting systems.      But the totals in your accounts are unrelated to the totals of cash the banks' actually have on hand.

That's nothing more than assumption.


If the Proof of Work algorithm is complex enough,  or designed so that the work can't be accomplished by another hardware unit by sending an input once and having the hardware unit increment a counter over and over,  then Voila -- you will have built a  better  general processing chip.
That doesn't necessarily mean any currently existing blockchain  has perfection in ASIC resistance,   But maybe enough to prevent a practical ASIC being developed.
One of the requirements to design a specialized chip for the POW algorithm though --- is you need to know the POW algorithm.     It's possible that a  Blockchain could require its POW algorithm be executed in a bytecode virtual machine executor,   AND the algorithm would mutate  based on  the  Block number and the hash of the previous block -- additional random mutations and operations would be introduced into the base virtual machine code  by the network pushing instructions down onto a stack,  And/OR a bytecode sequence would have to be executed to guess an Input sequence.
To "mine";  the miner would have to compute bytecodes to setup execution of a virtual machine based on the previous block a time-dependent counter, and  the next block they're about to try,  then run an execution pass with the hash inputs and outputs  to decide the result. 
Each VM Instruction type  being a Bytecode  that operates on  3 Input parameters:   The hash of the previous instruction output Concatenated with an instruction number,   The hash of the previous block concatenated with the instruction number,  the hash of the Next trial block,   And   Yields 1  Output --  The hash of a complex computation  taken on the 3 inputs.
You could fix the first  5  instructions,  then determine the  100 to 10000+ instructions   will be a rolling list of instructions  with  1 new instruction added each block  and inserted into a position modulo the lower bits of the hash,   until a maximum number of rolling instructions is reached based on the difficulty,   and 1 instruction from the rolling list will be replaced with each new block.
Now...  In order to make the virtual machine "ASIC Resistant";   the Collection of instructions should be able to have any computation a general computer can do,   But to avoid having an infinite loop:  we'll need to make a rule that each  specific bytecode entry  cannot be  executed more than 50,000 times in the same block.
But one can have things like
 a,b,c,d
# a,b,c,d  Are always the sha256 hashes from the previous, next block, and output from previous instruction
So a "program" is just a list of instruction names
MD5_HASH10  #  Execute MD5(a+b+c+d) hash operation,  repeat 10 times with the previous input  into the next output
LOOP_10           #  Repeat preceding operation 10 times.
REPEAT_3          # Repeat the next operation 3 times
SQRT_2_63       #  Calculate a square root  on  d Modulo 2^63
MMAP_1GB        #  Populate a 1GB virtual memory space  by writing x=SHA256(a+b+c) for the first 32 bytes,  hash with SHA256(a+x+b+c)  for the next successive 32 bytes until 1GB is filled ---  the output is 
the hash of  the 1GB virtual memory space.
BSWAP_16        #  Reverse the 16 high-order bits of d
LSPACE_32        # Evaluate integer  f(x) = a mod 2^63  + b  mod2^63 x 
....   etc ....
At that point if you define a large enough instruction set,  then you will encompass every capability of a general computer,   and then only need to be concerned   to make sure that on average...   the computations to solve a block will not be skewed towards a small subset of instructions or capabilities.

As long as the fed is going to pay enough interest for them to keep that money on deposit with the fed,  then I don't think it is going anywhere.
However, this doesn't seem like a sustainable solution,  because eventually that little bit of interest is going to add up to be a heck of a lot of money.

Why say you that?   Of course it's not impossible  to have an ASIC-resistant algorithm  by exploiting the limitations of ASIC development,    But as the discussion shows ASIC-Resistance is not enough.....    Proof of Work to  encourage maximum  decentralization would also need to be GPU-resistant,  and  while that's harder....     the  CryptoNite-lite  proof of work algorithm  used by some cryptos derived from Monero is an example of algos believed to have achieved this...      That is,  where GPU doesn't give an advantage over CPU.
@_date: 2018-05-23 02:37:17
That's my point....  Nothing makes it impossible for them to do this right now;  they already can.     There are likely many reasons for Coinbase to obtain a banking license  which should be favorable to customers.
For example:  By having a national banking charter,  Coinbase will
no longer be dependent on banking partners to hold their custodial accounts for fiat.    Random banks that have been leery of cryptocurrencies  in the past such as Bank of America will likely have a harder  time closing accounts of customers just for bringing funds in from Coinbase,   as CB will be a fully licensed bank:  at that point  other banks who decide they'll  "Refuse to allow their customers to deal with Coinbase"  may be subject to losing their own banking license or other penalties/adverse actions by regulators due to antitrust/anti-competitive behavior.
Also,  with a national charter,  Coinbase would be regulated by the feds and no longer be subject to  special requirements, restrictions, or other regulations individual states have setup or failed to setup surrounding Cryptocurrency businesses or financial businesses that may impede their operation as an exchange,  since a  federal charter means  their regulator is  the federal regulator.
They can potentially clear up a bunch of hurdles allowing Coinbase to operate more efficiently and with more confidence.

Experimental QCs are very expensive to keep operational --- think millions per  minute of CPU time,  and there are plenty of valuable problems of commercial and scientific value to make high demand for use of QC time.
It would take a very High Qubit quantum computer to crack real-world keys "instantly";  IBM has been talking about the momentous accomplishment of building a 50-QUBIT QC..
Building a QC with more Qubits becomes exponentially harder and causes new engineering problems  ---- these are engineering  feat that has more to do with the physics than the computer science.
You need on the order of 2000 QUBITS.    But if you get say a 500-QUBIT QC,  you may be able to apply it to larger factoring problems but not get close to an instant answer,   and for all we know the more QUBITS you get added the slower the overall machine will actually work.

Not always.   The value of a GH/s  depends on more than the difficulty rate.    It also depends on the fiat to BTC exchange rate.
If the difficulty goes up 20%  in a particular period,  but BTC goes from $500 to $640  during that same period,  then the value of a GH/s during that time has actually gone up.

The blockchain is just numbers.  You can encode any data you want by specifying the bits in the output addresses and amounts spent.   It's going to be instructions for decoding or translating those numbers into specific data items which might be declared illegal.
I.e. you need someone to tell you what transaction IDs have numbers on them, AND what rules you want to use in order to decode those numbers into something meaningful.

Moving to p2pool was the right decision when GHASH.IO was at risk of breaking 51%.
Since their hardware CANNOT actually properly work with p2pool, which they found out, it turns out, and no pool is at risk of approaching 51%,  then  using the pool with the lowest variability is definitely the right decision.
The circumstances that caused them to hold the vote changed.
Of course at the end of the day, while they may ask for unitholder input, but it wasn't a binding vote, and when situations change so dramatically, MANAGEMENT is expected to MANAGE appropriately and make the decisions that will be most profitable for unitholders.
I DON'T expect them to  respond to the vote in a costly manner, by scrapping hardware and looking for new gear that will work more properly with p2pool.
Furthermore,  a move to p2pool would in all likelihood, greatly reduce the mining profitability  or consistency for unitholders.
It would make holding any PETA units even more like gambling than investing.

"I am a bank. You deposit 100 dollars into an account you hold with me.  Fractional reserve lending allows me to multiply that 100$ by 10, and then loan out 900$ of that newly created money"
I want to clarify something....  Once you deposit the $100.   That $100 is no longer your money.
You deposit $100, and ownership of the money is transferred to the bank.     You then become an unsecured creditor of the bank.     The bank has an obligation to you  in the amount of your deposit,  but the bank has the cash.
Now the bank can loan out money that doesn't even exist, because it's not money, it's a promise to deliver money,  that statistically never gets exercised, because everyone keeps their money in the bank.
If a large enough number of people demanded to withdraw all their money from the banks simultaneously, then the entire system would collapse ---  to prevent that,  banks have a limited amount of cash on hand, there's only so much you can withdraw: and in the event of a calamity,   the banks would just all close their doors and customer service window,  there could be a month long banking holiday, until the calamity passed.

Not true.  FDIC  won't protect from fraud or theft.   Most banks are required to have private insurance which will protect you to some extent.
Similarly, bitcoin users can protect from theft by utilizing multisig wallets,  paper wallets, and other special controls;  to the extent there is additional risk, it can all be mitigated with lower cost.


You can lose money due to bank error, or unauthorized transactions if you don't notice the error within the time limit.     Many people don't read their bank statements.
In addition, with a bank account:  you can lose money due to identity theft and unauthorized withdrawals.
The bitcoin network doesn't have "errors";  only the user can have errors.




These two are the same issue,  and Bitcoin users can prevent their balance from being lost in either event, by making backups.
In addition:  bank account users have some additional ways to lose access to their balance....  e.g.
Temporary loss:   While 'temporary'  can be 30 days or more in duration.    You may eventually get the matter addressed, but in the meantime you will have to do without your money.
Temporary loss of access to entire balance due to bank closure, identity theft,  or failure on your bank's part.
Temporary loss of access to entire balance due to unauthorized transaction.
Temporary loss of access to balance due to legal or government actions ordering the bank to suspend operations.
Loss of access at the start of a legal dispute process,  such as bank receiving an order to hold and refuse orders to make payments against all funds.

The proposition that saving some bitcoins is a bad idea is a controversial proposition.
Anyone saving some coins should certainly understand and contemplate the volatility and the risks before doing so and continuing to do so,  and for most investors:  it would not be suitable to save more than a minimal amount in Bitcoin,  less than 1% of their holdings.
Many assets are similarly volatile,  and the diversity of investments to choose from is important; savings should be held as a combination of assets, including stocks, commodities, and real-estate.   Risk  is most effectively mitigated through good diversification, even when some of the investments are volatile,  and a key is to find a healthy mixture of savings vehicles that are uncorrelated.
For those saving dollars or other fiat currency, we KNOW,  that value is expected to be lost over time,  due to  devaluation of the currency resulting from  inflation ----  which  is understood to be significantly understated by the official CPI numbers and is trending upwards.
Also... Bitcoin  MAY  lose some or much of their value in a short period of time, but may also gain much value in a short period of time.    The volatility is not that high compared to some other investments --- there is some risk,  but overestimating risk and underestimating expected value would be detrimental to objectively considering the on average expected return on certain investment choices.
So  Bitcoin might seem like a poor value store  based on analysis of its price chart,  but that's mostly due to market uncertainy about its future.     Dollars are DEFINITELY a poor store of value, however.

Change what is being exchanged.   I don't see anytime soon, the ability to buy or sell copyrights being restricted.   Indeed... software makers and  entertainment studios all over the world have large businesses reliant on the ability to buy and sell copyrighted works to consumers.
Furthermore, cryptography, and digital rights management has a critical role for all these industries... therefore,  I suggest  changing the "Exchange"  into a business, where  an entry on the Blockchain is  DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT infrastructure.
Create a business that buys virtual software licenses from "Vendors" and Buys/Sells licenses to "Customers" ----  the software may be entirely nominal,  that is, the software might not exist;   the software might be the right to use elements of the Bitcoin network itself,  protected by the DRM  procedures created by miners.
Or perhaps there really is a software product,  let's just call it "HelloWorld.c" for the sake of argument.     And it is licensed in terms of  number of  times you are allowed to run the program per day,  before you must acquire more rights originating with the author to not be guilty of infringement.
Now... with this new business
"Bitcoin" is then not being exchanged as a method of payment, and it is merely being a tool used to track the specified transfer  of licenses costing a certain amount.
The blockchain's distributed database characteristics are being leveraged (Similar to recording license entitlements to a specific IP address using DNS entries on a secured domain).
During the process of completing a purchase or sale, a digital signature is required,  and the block chain will be used to keep track of the license  and the purchase/sale.
For example,  I pay you  $1000 US,  and therefore, I acquire the "right"  to use some  software component I have just purchased   in order to license the copyright to their work, and receive permission to use  helloworld.c, for example.
The vendor will enter and sign a digital transaction on the blockchain, showing that I have purchased a  right to use a certain piece of packaged software,  and a certain bitcoin value will correspond to this right  that I have acquired.
A few days later,  I may decide   that I  no longer need the right to  helloworld.c,  so I want to give it to someone else.
I may digitally sign a new transaction surrendering a portion of the license that I received to someone else,   and in return, since I am now a vendor of this software shop,   will receive compensation  in  $500 US,  for   the share of  usage rights that I have given up on the software I just purchased.

I think because 'inflation' is a term so well-known to the consumer, that economists want to make sure that the definition they will use for it reflects what consumers see directly.
Partly to take a political position that "inflation" means the price in X dollars merchants demand for A, not the expansion in supply of dollars.

There is also indirect profit from mining:  Bitcoin is worth nothing if there are no miners.   A high hashrate increases security of the network, and decreases the chance a Bitcoin will be worth $0 tomorrow.
You could argue that those who are just buying Bitcoins  in the hopes of appreciation are "freeriders,"  and   the fact that there are miners  and merchants accepting coins  from miners for goods and services make the entire system possible  ---- however, by purchasing Bitcoins,  they are also helping produce profits for miners, so they are creating demand for Bitcoins as well.........    the price of Bitcoins are so low, that it is probably the bigger opportunity right now to just buy Coins, however :)

But hey... for the sake of argument...  let's say there's a chance of getting the BTC refunded,  because there probably is.

So what happens when law enforcement attempts to build a mandatory "Joint taskforce"  between operators of multiple pools?
For example:   Pool operator A  receives a court order  to freeze a certain account from operator A's local government and is ordered to develop a plan which other pool operators will be required to follow.
Pool operator B , Pool operator C, and Pool operator D all simultaneously receive court orders from their local governments   to cooperate with Pool operator A's plans. 
Pool operators A, B, C, and D,   each being large pools with over 15% share,  so their hashrate sums to an amount above 51%.
I would also be concerned about corporate mergers... for example:  GHash.IO  could  buy out the operator of another mining pool, and gain control of their hashing power.
They could also "split" the GHash.IO pool into two child pools which would each appear to have less than 40%.   Or they could covertly run a portion of their hashing power on  other people's mines, BUT....   they would still in effect have the ability to control of over 51% of the hashing power  --- and therefore, the ability to double spend one day or another, or start a surprising attack for a brief time one night,  even without GHash.IO itself showing over 51% of the hashing.

Unless your coins came from mining;  using a mixing service is or has the potential to be extremely dangerous.
For example: if you took coins out of an exchange,  and authorities are looking  at the BTC address used by a mixing service,  and they see an address they know is from an Exchange,   they can Subpoena the exchange to figure out which customer originated the bitcoins that ultimately went to the mixing service address.
The use of a mixing service might be a legal gray area; the act of using the mixing service by itself with intent to create a structured transaction to hide the origin of funds ----  may have legal issues,  and authorities might have some theory that allows them to make charges and prosecute.
If not, then sending to a mixing service, is likely at least probable cause to  arrest,  conduct searches and seizures, and compel you to hand over your private encryption keys, including the keys  used to unlock your Bitcoin addresses, so that  they can proceed with the civil forfeiture of your economic value.

An alternative would be to start delaying payouts, by handing out the PPLNS payments to miners with a nLocktime, based on the hashrate of the pool at the time.
The closer the pool gets to 50%, the longer a delay should be added.
40% =  1 extra day delay before payouts are made
42% =  2 day delay before payout
44% =  10 day delay before payout
45% =  20; 47% =  45 day; 48% =  60 day
49% =  90 day;   51% =  180 day
52% =  365 day delay

Last I check, the only way you can possibly reverse an ACH/ETF is by signing an Affidavit stating that  you didn't authorize the original bank transfer.
It would probably be good to point out at this point, however....  Coinbase sends you a SMS or requires 2 factor on the withdrawal, so  this would imply a compromise of Coinbases' system.

They could have changed their choice of mining pool to whatever they thought best anytime they wanted without a vote.
They probably held the vote,  because of lack of clarity of what would be the right thing to do at that point;  stick with  GHASH.IO,  despite the immediate 51% problem,  go p2pool, or switch to another pool.
If the Ghash went over 51%, then it was at risk of devaluing Bitcoins: therefore,  rendering the mining of them quite moot.
On the other hand, switching to p2pool is an immediate sacrifice of miner profits and hashing power,   which is bad for unitholders financially.
By holding the vote,  management was able to proceed decisively in a direction that was not in unitholders' best interests in the first place.
I think it's good to see that they have found some clarity,  and for now, backtracked on moving to p2pool.

By the sound of it; these vouchers don't even have a private key, they represent a "promise" by the originator to deliver a certain amount of Bitcoins,  so I would describe these vouchers as  "Zero coupon bearer bonds".
By the way,  if the vouchers ***did*** contain keys,  it's not necessarily true that the counterparty has to have made themselves able to spend the amount.
They could use a system involving a multisig address,  where another mutually-trusted entity would have to approve the transaction redeeming the voucher,  with the buyer setting up an authentication code with the 3rd party 'guarantor' at the time of sale.

Not really... just an "Order to pay balance of the count to X", but only if condition Y is true.
You don't need a power of attorney to execute the account holder's order.
Another option would simply be to say  "If your account is active for 4.5 years,  and you have a balance worth more than $5 US,   we will automatically  generate a new dedicated wallet for you, spend all your funds  to the dedicated wallet,   and  irreversibly encrypt all copies of the secret key,  so the coins cannot be retrieved without you completing a Q&amp;A process"
We will send you by e-mail  and by postal mail on the date of deactivation, a pre-signed transaction for transferring the value of the segregated account to your designated Bitcoin recipient address.
You can also decrypt the private key stored on our server and retrieve your coins if you provide:
* Your e-mail address, full name, city, date of birth,  social security number,  AND
* Your password and a security PIN number
* The answer to 3 security questions of your choice
Then a beneficiary address is not required to retain security of the coins  against interference.
The presumption is the wallet provider would be willing to destroy the secret key,  essentially denying even them access to the coins.
However, they might also pre-sign a time locked transaction to themselves to allow the coins to be recovered after a specified number of years, time locked transaction to release to another specified party, or otherwise handled in a manner agreed upon in advance;  if the coins aren't claimed within even 10, 20, or 50 years.

OK, then... to give Core a fair shot...  How about the developers of core  push an update that  will -- if the B2X hard fork occurs -
hard fork at the same time as the B2X hard fork   and reset the difficulty  in order to  relieve the problem adjusting?
That way it won't "slow down" -- thus avoiding giving more miners and users an incentive to jump on the 2X fork to avoid the slowdown.
That's the first thought.    The second thought,  which could be very dangerous, would be kill 2X  by changing the proof of work function, effectively killing the current generation of ASIC miners,   since they're not programmable enough to adapt to a minor change in the hash function like FPGA or GPU-based miners are.

You just need to show your cost basis for the things you sold was $4000 that you spent;  A receipt or order confirmation showing you buying BTC and paying $4k,  And a confirm showing the amount of BTC you sold with those proceeds as an Identical number of BTC should suffice for your records...
Income is  Total Proceeds from sale MINUS  the Cost or other Basis.
If you owed taxes on the $4000 you earned to purchase the Bitcoins with originally which you never had paid,  then that's a completely separate issue, and would already be a violation from prior years, even if you never sell any BTC....

Here's the mistake... in an attack,  the miners are not constrained to producing blocks every 10 minutes  --- the colluding miners can lie about how long it took to make a block and have the difficulty whatever they want.    The **longest chain** always wins;  even if it took 1 minute to produce every block.   
The **longest chain** is the sequence of valid blocks that could be found from the genesis  to some leaf node at the bottom of the tree with **The most work**.
In other words:  If there are two competing chains,  then SUM the **difficulties**  of  the blocks in each chain,   and whichever of the chains has the greatest difficulty  wins,  because it's the longer chain.
Now....  if you control 51% of the hashing power that there's ever been,   then that means if you decide from what point you want to start rewriting history and start working on hashing that sequence of blocks blocks now,  then  you have enough computing power you will eventually be able to catch up with and overtake  the other chain   (You can make the total sum of block difficulties on your chain higher).

One could try to make that case, but it is very likely that the taxing authority will find that position unacceptable.   Would you be prepared to duke it out in court?
What happens is the "mined" coins are too close to actual currency for the taxing authority to accept that this is a good you manufacture in the hopes of selling  ---  the Bitcoin itself is a commodity that have a liquid market, so your "income" in the value of the BTC is recognized immediately.
Also,  unless you are Solo mining....  you aren't actually the direct party creating the Bitcoins ---  the mining **pool** you participate in creates the Bitcoins,  and in exchange for your contribution,  the operator of the mining pool pays you compensation in BTC  for the work your equipment contributed to the pool finding the block.
So actually,  someone else makes the BTC and you contributed a portion of the work and **receive payment** in accordance with how much a share of the work you had contributed to making the BTC.
In other words....  what you receive is not manufactured by you at all;  it's a compensatory payment made by someone else.     It just so happens that the  mining pools pay out almost all the BTC they create  as compensation to the miners,  and keep a small %  the  "pool fee"   to help pay for the upkeep and operation of the pool.

You are only comparing current price to previous prices,  but most economists will tell you that prices of currencies are based on supply and demand, and the price is what the price is.
And no fiat currency has an "intrinsic worth",  so ultimately the worth of a currency is determined by the population of people who will honor it for payment for trade --- e.g.  the worth of US dollars in your pocket is dependent entirely on prices set by a population of merchants who will accept your dollars for products.
Perhaps the price should have been $5000 USD per BTC all along,  but it was only artificially low  because it lacked the popularity or people were being apprehensive to use BTC.
Increase in popularity means more people using it or "buying into it",  which means more people demanding BTC.    That is a very normal reason for prices to increase.


That's not a reasonable assertion to try to make.   There can be **many** things,  both visible and not visible to you  that could cause a CHANGE in the velocity of demand.




"Popularity"?  But  "Very few people use bitcoin"? 
You contradict yourself,   but I would welcome you to demonstrate your assertions.
You just mine it or buy it from someone who has it like you said.   As long as you get a good price when you buy it  (Less average fee overhead than a CC after you divide your costs across ALL the spending of bitcoins you got),   then it's mutually beneficial to do the donation using BTC -- mainly because credit card networks charge a high price for their services.

If the actual seed is (A),  then you Generate a second random seed (B),  and compute the bitwise XOR  (A) with (B) to create (C).
Or you could just convert the mnemonic words of (A) and (B) into their Bip39 numbers and XOR each pair of numbers together to create the 3rd  set of numbers.
Remember the mnemonic wordlist used to recover the seed is just a system for representing the binary seed for humans where each word represents a group of  11 bits from the binary seed and the last word  represents the checksum bits.
Destroy (A),  and then   the person must possess both (B) and (C) to XOR (B) and (C) together in order to derive (A).

Which developer do you have suggesting this would be trivial?
Mostly the people that speak of  "adding decimal places" to Bitcoin have a total misunderstanding  of what is required from a programming standpoint to represent exact real-number decimal quantities including efficient support for all the basic native arithmetic math functions to work with no rounding acceptable  OR didn't understand that as far as the Bitcoin protocol is concerned there is no such thing as  "1 Bitcoin",   there are  ONLY base Units called Satoshi,  and 1  Bitcoin is defined  at a higher level to be  10^8  Satoshi.
People who've said "8 decimal places"   was an arbitrary cut-off in the  user interface, GUI, or something,  just had no idea what they were talking about,   otherwise they'd realize that the proposition: add X  decimal places is equivalent saying that now: "1 Bitcoin should now  be 10^(8+X) Satoshi".
Then to re-formulate the base units:  it is necessary that EVERY place any of piece of software previously calculated  1 BTC = 10^8  Satoshi,  the new calculation has to change to  1 BTC = 10^(8+X),     AND  for every transaction BEFORE an agreed Cutoff,   the Base Unit quantities need to be multipled by  10^X    to adjust the number of Satoshis  created from every past and future action  for the new base units.
This also means future mining rewards after the cutoff block number need to be adjusted to be multiplied by 10^X.
The Base Units are commonly represented in the Bitcoin core itself AND in many  3rd party software programs as a  structural **64-bit integer**   int64_t.
Most runtime environments don't have a 128-Bit integer datatype available,  or  N-Bit Integer datatype,  so even if you could just increase the number of bits in the data structure ----  that is a non-trivial set of changes to implementation   just  to restore  the  original Arithmetic logic.
You would have a great gnashing of teeth, as common language implementations don't provide a nice clean way for programmers to do  native arithmetic on 128-bit numbers.    The result will require some custom code  OR use of a 3rd party math library,   and there is a performance cost.
Making a fundamental change to the size in bits of the transaction structure is an even more  problematic issue to deal with;   this  would definitely be an ATYPICAL change.     Most forks and changes  to the Bitcoin protocol have been about changing the **MEANING** or **Interpretation**  of what a valid transaction is,  not changing the binary formats used to send data over the network ---   When the data formats don't actually change - old and new clients   can see that there is a fork;    they may  disagree on  what is valid,  But  they can all still read all the transactions.
Changing this format without creating major instability would require adding versioning to the transaction inputs and output formats in some way,  and getting THAT change to support both the old format and a new future format completely propagated throughout the ecosystem  before  activating usage of a new format and conducting a base units change.
There are multiple major hurdles trying to change the base units.
(1) Sufficiency of demand:   Could you even justify it,  given all the many hours of developer time that will be required for all Wallets and BTC-related software?
(2) Resistance to change by the installed base.    1 Satoshi has already been established to mean a certain value.    Changing the base unit  is going to  invalidate a lot of documentation.
(3) Technical hurdles in formulating and deploying an inherently breaking change  requiring multiple phases of implementation  without  widespread major issues for users (have simultaneous support for old and new data formats fully deployed,  before using the new formats).
Regarding implementation:
If try just shifting the base units without expanding the structure field,  then you'll  run into a problem because  2^64   only has 19 decimal places to play with.
For example: if you want  10^16  Satoshi to become the new base unit,  then you will upset users,  Because it will no longer to possible to transfer more than   1844 Bitcoins in a single transaction output.
The current base unit size allows up to a maximum of  184,467 Million Bitcoins to be transferred within a 64-bit integer;   Realistically,    the most decimal places you could add would be about 5,   because  it's unlikely for  more than 1 Million BTC to be required in a single transaction.

My question: Who OWNS the Bitcoin trademark these days, anyways?   Last I heard it was Mt. Gox that owned it,  but they went bankrupt and were forced to sell such things off including the trademarks.
When it comes down to it;  Operation of a Website is a centralized thing,  and so is  a software development project.
The real-world deployment can be decentralized, but at some level you need  to be able to have TRUSTED PLAYERS   performing the operations  such as Running a website that  in their very nature have inescapable centralized aspects.

Naw... it's perfectly reasonable.    Just call it a "Miner tip"  instead of a fee,  and show a slider  with options  1, 2, 3, 4, and 5   for Tip size  which defaults to the middle option (3) selected,  and use statistical data gathering to determine what  Sat/Byte values to assign to those based on current network conditions,  e.g..
Where  3 will be 100% of a base fee,   2 will be 50%,   1 will be 10%,   4 will be 200%, and 5 will be 400%.
 
To determine the fee values for each position on the slider,  capture summary statistics from all transactions on the last  144 blockchain blocks,   and the current  transaction mempool.
If the Bitcoin network has more than 1750 transactions unprocessed with &gt; 30 Sat/B,   then  warn the user to check a box to pay an extra tip to cover "Demand surge"; the base fee  with demand surge will be  no less than 30 Sat/B, but otherwise the minimum amount to put this transaction in the Top  1700 transactions   both in terms of Total fee and in terms of  Sat/Byte.
If not, then the base fee is the Median fee in Sat/Byte of the transactions in the past 144 blocks.

Buying and furnishing an expensive &gt;100K house is a huge luxury purchase for living expenses,   and a big money hole due to insurance requirements and all the other major periodic maintenance and inevitable repair/replace costs that come with homeownership,  so yeah....  49 BTC is not enough to retire on if you buy one of those, AND the purchase also comes by wiping out most of your liquid cash and investments including that 49 BTC.
49 BTC might be plenty to retire on if you settle in a low-cost-to-live area: rent your living quarters for a low/reasonable rate,  don't indulge in excessive purchasing,  don't convert it al to fiat immediately, and take the proper planning to limit your expenses,   especially if you keep a part time job and/or have other investments  and retirement resources.

It pretty much is the ultimate limit of divisibility offered.   There are theoretical ways  the protocol's transaction structures could be re-designed to provide more depth in terms of transactable units per BTC,   but it would be a major project requiring breaking changes to the protocol, and a "flag day" as it were, to say the least;   afterwards your protocol is fundamentally different from the Bitcoin protocol definition.
It is not likely,  because you're literally talking about a change in the unit of account for BTC.      Such a change would require a complicated hard fork,    since the result would be  a change to transaction entries that is neither forward nor backwards-compatible,  particularly if the number will change from a 64-bitT to a 128-BitT Value,  and old nodes and clients could no longer even read new blockchain entries.
All the Wallets, Nodes, and Miners,   every piece of software would have to be touched   in  a manner that would also be prone to induce bugs  (thus requiring much testing).
To essentially shift  what a   Satoshi means to a smaller fraction of a BTC,   e.g. to make  1 Sat  1/(10^16)  instead of 1/(10^8) .
So you could say in a theoretical sense  it is possible,  BUT in a practical sense,  it  is probably infeasible,  even if there were significant demand.

We have a good idea of what Bitcoin's monetary supply is,  because the eventual physical quantity is fixed.     The only question is by what number do total Bitcoins "lent"  (obligations by lenders)  exceed the number of bitcoins in existence, or in active circulation.
It's not the same as with fiat though,  because of BTC being divisible down to 8 decimal places.     If  BTC became too scarce, then users could start using mBTC or Satoshis to transact.

Try the Shadowstats CPI figures.    Future inflation in the neighborhood of 7% or higher is not out of the question.


Interest rates increasing doesn't so much reduce the pool of money consumers have to leverage for buying non-discretionary goods such as food,  and government is a major buyer there injecting $$$ into that market directly.
Higher interest rates simply slow the growth of the aggregate economy and reduce the available $$$ for businesses delivering optional goods.
Unfortunately,  while that segment of the economy deflates,  that means there will be more money chasing bare essentials like bread,  thus  increase in interest rates can result in higher inflation in the price for other kinds of goods and services.
Also,  pushing up interest rates won't undo the damage regarding QE*,   and the large asset bubbles  in Real-estate and the stock markets which  the fed started inflating to "ease" economic issues that continues to grow -----  the world banks are chained and cannot meaningfully increase interest,  thus significant inflation is in our futures,  at least until bond reporting agencies  decide the US government is no longer creditworthy for an A rating  (Won't be Moody's,  because they'd probably be lynched for "treason") and force the US to take the poison pill -  which is to Un-Print a few hundred trillion $$$  and suffer the market armageddon which the Fed has made an eventual certainty.

If you invest 100% of it at 6.5% year, which is an incredibly good return.... the figure you have will be 2 million within a decade.
Anyways; if you put your 1 million in bonds and collect 2% interest payments; that's 20k a year or about 1660/month.
That might be a perfectly viable strategy if you can find a way to live off what remains of that per year after taxes,  including pay your insurance costs -- AND substantively seek to better yourself  or do something else that will generate income now or later.
You might for instance.... move somewhere like Puerto Rico where the cost of living is less,  and your interest earnings and dividends will become  free of federal income tax being taxed at 0%,  then you can grow your investments at a higher rate.
Perhaps you have some entrepreneurial ideas  that you cannot pursue effectively,  since you spend so much time working,  for example.

Obviously because Coinbase warned you,  Probably you won't have a case,  and the service Coinbase offers is somewhat different from a normal trading exchange,  they likely have more accounts to deal with,  and may not have had the needed systems and modifications in place to handle a fork at the time of the split.

35 of the people arriving would have not been on the guest list, so they didn't get in.

As long as there was a living designated beneficiary for the death benefits at the time of death, nope;  the payout occurs outside probate and bypasses the estate  ----  the money belongs to the beneficiaries, not the estate.
In this manner: creditors are not able to divert the payout of proceeds from life insurance away from the named beneficiaries on the policy.
The exception is if there is no beneficiary, or the deceased named the estate itself as a beneficiary of the life insurance policy.
If there is no heir-at-law to receive the life insurance benefit,  then the benefits will be taken by the estate into probate and can be used to pay the deceaseds' final bill.

So after taking 3% out of a $10 transaction, you get  $9.70; a cost of  $0.30;   Or after taking 3% out of a $100 transaction, you get  $97.00 at a cost of  $3.00;   Or taking 3% out of a $1000 transaction you get  $970 at a cost of $30.
For the first two scenarios  $10 and $100 transactions;  Bitcoin fees have been higher per-TX than that   at times.
I guess as the dollar amount increases  Bitcoin is more and more advantageous,   Because fees are based on Satoshis per Byte of data  of your transactions,   which don't scale with the cost of your transaction....
While paying BTC equivalent to a $3 US fee may be outrageous for a $10 US transaction;  it's competitive with traditional methods for a US $100 transaction,  and an awesome deal  for  transactions valued at $1000 and above.
So does this make sense....    don't use Bitcoins for your every day spending,  but DO use them for  large purchases and for transferring cash to family/friends in place of services like Western Union  that take a 5% cut,  BECAUSE the Bitcoin  **flat rate** is advantageous.

It's true that you could buy $100 worth of Bitcoin regardless of the price,   thanks to the ability to purchase fractional parts of a Bitcoin.
There have been other companies in the past such as Sharebuilder and DRIPS programs that allowed you to buy in a fractional share of stocks.
It's an interesting theory that this could be a reason for crashes to work differently than with common stocks,  but i'm doubting it.    
The vast majority of common stocks have share prices such that almost anyone could afford a whole share...
Secondly,  stock shares represent rights to the profits of a company, not money,   so  share values are directly affected by the productiveness and the demand for goods and services companies sell,  and  currencies are quite different  ----  if anything, currency units  such as dollars in a bank account  or BTC in a wallet may be demanded More for savings purposes  at times when companies and economies are producing less value.

If you make 10,000 trades in a day....  they're going to setup a system to automatically parse your trade records to answer one question.    Also, since you make so many trades you will be classified as a professional trader, which means all your trading assets  held will be Marked to Market at the end of the year, and your gains are ordinary income instead of capital gains  (The ability to defer taxes is lost).
They will ask:  What asset totals did you have at the start of that day, and what asset totals did you have at the end of that day after all that trading activity?
Then they'll use their 3rd party data sources and convert those asset quantities into dollar amounts.
If at the end of the day the dollar amount is more than at the start,  then you'll have income, and if not,  then you'll have a loss.

They don't have to know the exact price;  if they've declined your submission for that trading activity,  then the IRS has the freedom to determine the information or replace with their estimated amounts.
It is most likely to occur if a taxpayer only has their own notes or documentation and cannot produce a US-licensed banker or broker's receipt for trades **proving**   the sales or purchase prices matching those claimed.
Anyways,  if you purchased coins from fiat the  ultimate basis is easy for the IRS to establish ----  they will lookup the transaction with your bank to find how much fiat you exchanged for that coin.
Later when you sell,  they will look at  (1) How much cash you received, and  (2)  How much remaining cryptocurrency you have in your accounts (they can require you tell them)  -----   If you later turn up and sell  more you hadn't reported to still have,  they'll have you on fraud.

Not necessarily.   People pay with credit cards all the time, and have no idea what the nominal interest or other bank charges will be until they get their statement.




It doesn't matter whether or not that matches their intuitions; that's just the sensible way for fees to work with a blockchain, and people have to learn the unique concepts and mechanics of the payment method they use.
For example, when using Credit Cards people have to learn about such things as  Expiration Dates and CVV numbers....   clearly it doesn't matter that its non-intuitive, as people still manage to buy things online with a credit card.
Similarly,  people figure out how to tip their  servers at restaurants,
and  similarly with cash,  people have to work out how to combine these fixed-denomination pieces of currency to arrive at the amount to pay.
Every payment method has its quirks,  and people will learn about the  sizing of the fees as   Fraction of a BTC   Per  Unit of Data.

If he's clueful at all that's not likely,  other than the merchant disappearing -- the listing represents that the product sold is "Good for Bitcoin long term storage ".
That means if the coins disappear;  then the buyer can potentially file a lawsuit against the merchant based on damages caused by their misrepresented product which turned out to be unsuitable.
The listing contains no disclaimer of warranty,  so there's an implied absolute warranty regarding certain things such as representations made by the seller, and   "buyer's family maybe took the coins" wouldn't fly.
The practical problem;  is  the merchant will disappear -- or  people clueless enough to use this probably don't  have such coins at risk to make the cost of litigating criminal and civil damages,  or sufficient clue to archive listing text --- if the issue/risk was understood they wouldn't buy in the first place.

It seems like BTC surges at moments when things are looking bleakest and most doubtful about the world economy within the next 12 months -- regarding sociopolitical matters;  for example, on issues such as the escalating trade wars b/w US and other countries,  the Iran matter, etc....    BTC just happened to surge at the same time?   Coincidence:  I doubt?    And when the things settled down a little bit; the value of crypto eventually tanked.
I guess it could make sense that crypto could be an inverse play on normal trade in currencies tied to specific countries and their reserves  ---  this would lead to the prediction/speculation that if further reasons appear to fear and be concerned about the short term future of the world economy,  that BTC could  in theory be chasing a new ATH.

Yes it does.   Technical change is guaranteed to upset users if the constraints of the system mean that change is mathematically required to restrict the  operation  in a way that is known would in theory impact an end user's  costs or workflow;   In this case the in-place change of allocating more databits for divisibility  reduces the number of bits available for  representing large magnitudes.


I have given you the authoritative reference, which is the demonstrable details  that derive directly from mathematics,  the protocol specification, and the mechanics of the C programming language,  and now the burden of proof is on you to show how such an outlandish, extraordinary, and counterintuitive claim of "infinite divisibility"  could possibly be serviced   without any of the caveats and problems explained.




And back in the 1600s it was anyways accepted as fact that the earth was an entirely flat surface.    Matter of fact,  some folks still make that claim that to this day  in spite of empirical observations and mathematical calculations  that show it as an indefensible argument.
Your claims are on a par with the flat-earthers,  And it's not the round-earthers'  job to   try and find more round-earthers' to disagree with you ----  on the contrary,   when you make such extraordinary claims of infinite divisibility,  the burden of proof is on the person making that claim to show how it is so.....

For some reason,  it's only cryptos where this esoteric terminology came about.    If  "market cap"  of Bitcoin sticks,   then we'll soon need to start talking about the market caps of all currencies, judging their value by MKT CAP looks PARTICULARLY bad for inflationary currencies,   and as it turns out,   they will be massively larger to extreme scales,  especially since the reserve banks print money at will,   the value of all currencies out there is going to be much larger by  1000fold+ than anyone's annual GDP ----  if the market cap of  USD is  1000 thousand trillion,  then it follows that the  total estimated market cap of Bitcoin can easily become valued as a significant fraction of that.
Because it's completely about supply and demand, and if there's demand for Bitcoin they'll command a certain exchange rate.

It's the same **FRACTION** gain, which is a sensible measure if your policy is to **CONVERT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FIAT to BTC**,  and not  "Buy a certain number of BTC units".
Buying 1 BTC at $10K  would be a larger investment than buying 1 BTC at $3K.
Also,  going from $10000 to $11000  is a profit of $1000, which is much larger than going from $3000 to $3300 which is a  $300 profit.
Sure the profit is the **same fraction gain off an initial investment in 1 BTC**.

It was bad timing because of the outcome;  not because there's some skill a trader is supposed to have called "timing".   It COULD have been good timing if something different transpired, but it didn't!
That also wasn't a crash.  It was a retracement back to the average.   A crash is by definition,  a large number of assets that had stable value over a long period of time  suddenly,  without warning,  losing a large percentage of their value....   which is not what happened with BTC.
BTC had a short-lived positive spike that lasted a few weeks.   A price decrease that mirrors the increase  (Drops from the spike back to a recent average)  is  by definition not a crash,  but a "correction" or a return to a recent normal.
On  November 30, 2017... the price of BTC was at an All-Time-High of approximately $10,000  and had been no more than that for the past 30 days;   for the next 30 days there was a short-lived spike upwards  Or melt-up in price that topped out at around $20,000  on December 16,   but the price gradually declined down to eventually  $12,000 by the end of the month,  so it wasn't a crash  but a bear market  that corrected an  insane runup that had happened the first weeks of the month.

First... is  changing to different "coins" really a different asset?  You're moving in theory crypto value between different chains...  I would equate, for example changing from Ethereum to Bitcoin as moving an amount of "crypto coin" from one bank to another;  the core asset is still "crypto coin".
Question... if you've "swapped" between coins on a foreign exchange and never withdrawn any of them:  Have you actually "received" coins from any trade yet?
They're in the hands of a 3rd party that doesn't have exactly the recognized reliability of a bank  or other traditional financial institution.
You're presented a digital balance that doesn't necessarily represent anything.   How do you know you will receive the coins,  before you successfully withdraw it or transfer to an insured bank or crypto wallet or other  "well-proven/secure" storage?
This is like owning a vending machine that sells products --- sure in theory there is either cash or a "digital balance" collecting in the machine,  but until you physically visit it and secure the money in a fiat form,  there is nothing you received.    As far as you know some hacker or other criminal will come by and take the $$$,  or it will be devalued in some other manner  before you can get it,  translate it into monetary value,  and deposit to an insured bank for safe keeping.

OF course the thesis could also be incorrect.....   It could be a coincidence that the Gox sale was occuring at the same time,  OR the Gox sale alone wouldn't have caused it ----  but the selling was timed badly to coincide with other  factors  where selling pressure would be higher at the time.

In theory, BUT it's unlikely  they are awarding you enough BTC that there will be a non de-minimis profit.     What will happen is you  sell the BTC,  and the only number you will have to report will be either a  "capture" of the dollar value of those BTC  at the  time you redeem the points for a BTC award   OR  the   "line item cost"  of the thing points were rewarded against.
Except you can never report a "Capital Loss"  for reward points,  because even if you bought $1000 in goods, and received $50 worth in BTC:   you won't have a Capital Loss if that BTC turns out to be worth $0.
You also won't have a Capital Gain if that BTC turns out to be worth $999.
Your credit card rewards are a discount/return of some money you were due to pay.     Generally they are looking out for their own interests,  and will never pay you a reward worth more than a nominal amount   compared to the  revenue the CC company receives from that same activity they are rewarding.
Assume you were given BTC that was  worth 5% of the transaction amount,  then you need something like 1000%  growth  before you will  have a  50% discount on the statement item.
I realize that in the PAST  Bitcoin has been highly volatile.....  However,    1 Bitcoin =  $100,000  US  or   $200,000 US  is pretty far-fetched,   And  that's the type of  price increase that would HAVE to happen,  before your  "Bitcoin rewards"   would  be  worth more than 50% or 100%  of the goods/services purchases that are being rewarded.

Wrong.  The issuing bank in particular definitely has full power to reverse the charge; the issuing bank is responsible for determining the disbursment,  and ultimately their decision is final.   The issuing bank has the right to debit the funds back from the merchant's bank to undo the transaction for a period of time.   For some chargeback situations the merchant will have  a possibility to provide compelling evidence to disprove fraud, illegal activity, or  other actions in violation of the issuing bank's policies;  However,  whether to accept this evidence or not  and undo the reversal is ultimately at the discretion of the issuing bank.
Generally the merchant's bank or payment processor will hold a certain volume of the processed payments and not release them to the merchant until a period of time has elapsed following the  transactions,    Since  the merchant's bank will be on the hook for that money if a transaction is reversed by the issuer and leaves the merchant's account with a negative balance.

You seem to be running with the fallacy/slightly mistaken view that no record = they are in the clear.  It's quite the opposite;   the government already imposes through the IRS a mandatory quality recordkeeping of finances requirement on every citizen.    "Sold Bitcoin for cash" likewise requires very specific documentation  (and tax reports) -- failure to have documents of the cash sale can later become evidence of intent to commit tax evasion.


Then that could be a valid explanation,  but he'll need to produce the dated police report or  other document with a provable date around the time of the claimed hacking showing the incident happened.
If you took a large withdrawal such as $1000 in cash out of a marital account during the time you are married and you are negligent in being able to show the records of what happened with the cash,  then the presumption is that you absconded with the money ---  the burden of proof is upon the person taking the money to prove that they have done something legitimate with it  -- ant not merely keeping it hidden or in their personal possession.
The  $1000 can then be deducted from their share of the marital estate.
If a spouse fraudulently claimed you had no Bitcoin ----  it is possible that  that person will eventually enter transactions that make it evident they have more assets from before than claimed ---- for example when they want to actually SPEND some of that BTC they have amassed,   and when that occurs  you can be back in an  ex parte hearing and taken back to court,  but this time it will be for 50% of the Bitcoin  PLUS  massive penalties.

The reason Social Security is not a pyramid scheme -- is
- The "investors" are FORCED to pay into it.
- They are not promising unreasonable returns -- in fact,  the only returns Social Security promises you is a monthly payout adjusted for inflation  90% of your average past monthly wages up to $895 + 32% of your past monthly wages from $896 to $5397, and  15% of your past monthly wages from $5398 up to the maximum SS earnings.    Suppose you start working at 18 and you retire at the full benefit age which has been increased to 67  -- so you pay for 49 years  6.2% of your wages, plus another 6.2% of your wages paid by the employer;    14 of those years will be ignored  (BUT you still paid 12.4% of your wages for all those years), and  your wages for the top 35 years are averaged into an  "Average Monthly Earnings (indexed)".
At age 67 retirement;  you're expected to live another 33 years at most perhaps  --- BUT in inflation-adjusted terms: you've already paid more into Social Security,  than  you're ever expected to be paid in benefits.
My Golly... if Social Security made ANY returns at all with your money above inflation,   then  they profited off you, and you lost.
That's why Social Security's not a pyramid scheme,  Because the promised returns are essentially negative.
Now....  there are still potential issues SS could have;   because they need a source of cash sufficient to make today's payouts ---- in theory they have the money,  BUT they've loaned most of it to the US government by purchasing treasury notes ---  the SS's top investment is government debt,  so there's a lot of dirty self-dealing here,  And if SS   ever  has problems paying their benefits -  that will be why:  they failed to make sound investments  for people paying in between the years they were paying in and before benefits kick in.
There are other aspects of social security that are more dubious such as  "Means-tested disability";    these are more like traditional insurance,  and the premiums paid in might not be sufficient to cover it.....

The plaintiff might have a point, if the allegation is correct.... that they placed an order to buy BCH from Coinbase at one price, and then Coinbase executed the order at nearly twice the price  they showed when he placed the order.
As far as I know when you BUY a good or service,  the merchant has to provide it to you at Exactly the price you were shown at the time you committed the purchase,  not  1.5x the price, not 1.3x the price,  but 1.0x the price every time.
The exception would be if the buyer was on a trading exchange and committed a MARKET order  to buy the good from whoever on the market is selling the item at the best price ----  in other words  a  buy order matched against the best sell order;   in that case  the buyer specifically orders the brokerage to match them with a seller and give them their price without knowing it ahead of time;  in which case there'd be no claim against the broker ----  they didn't decide what the price would be,  the seller decided.

Fuel costs have a high dependence on LOCAL demand for fuels and often increase at a rate higher than the inflation,  but at other times they have decreased ----  Fuel increasing in cost at a different rate  because of production shortages or the pipeline/transport or speculation due to the geopolitical situation are totally different from 
 currency inflation.
Housing costs are highly-dependent on a local market, BUT overall they don't sustain an increase at a significantly higher average rate than 2.5%.  Your house is a HUGE one-off purchase,  and  most people locked in  their purchase price  AND  most of the inefficiency in buying a house is the cost of  overpaying due to bad choice of location or ineffective negotiations, broker commissions, and mortgage interest ----  you don't suffer  "Inflation of housing costs";  only if you  are a new house buyer,  do you wind up paying a time-specific premium ----- thus the appreciation of real-estate is not "Housing inflation"  in the same sense  As  **Food and Water Prices Inflation**,   because Housing costs for most people are their fixed payment that never changes against their favor with inflation.

"Facebook moderator AI: Ahah!  This user mentioned the word Bitcoin.  Must be  a hacked account or malware bot -- better shut them down!"

Also,  the message pops up even if the computer is a Chromebook or booted from a known good Ubuntu LiveCD ---  then Facebook's website continues to deny you access to your account and force you to download a .EXE  which they say you MUST run,  But is not even possible to run on these computers.

Mt.Gox was the LARGEST exchange that got outed as an essential quasi-scam and blew up causing that drop.

I suggest checking into what SS says their payout formula is....   it doesn't really work like a loan,  because your paid more than what you'll effectively take out -- and there's no interest or compensation to you for your LOST opportunity -- because they are holding your money.    You work 50 years,  and the government takes an average of your wages for the top 35 years of your career: 
 most people will have worked 150% of that number of years -- But there is no credit for those extra years paying into SS,  so you're really paying what amounts to about 17% per year of your wages averaged over the years SS actually credits you for,  then they convert it to a monthly amount  and multiply the average by an inflation factor that depends upon your retirement year.
For people retiring in 2017-2018 that factor is currently 1.0;  this factor does not increase significantly until 20 or 30 years after retirement.
So your initial monthly payout from Social Security for people retiring today who earned average $50k or $4166 average monthly earnings is:   0.90 * 895 + 0.32 * (4166 - 895)  = $1,852.22/Month
In other words,  Social Security will owe you the pay out: $22,226.64  per Year  for full benefits if  retiring today,   which is basically   45%  of  what your average annual wage was during the best 35 years of your employment  ----  assuming you live to be 100 and there are no further inflation increases,  then  Social Security will over the years pay out to  you $733,479.12.   
Then the kicker is... you paid in  12.4%  hard-earned all those years, PLUS those  15 years working that you got no credit for,  for example $50000 * 0.124 * 35 years = $217,000.
That would be another $93,000  you don't get credit for if you earned about $50k during your entire career.
What if you could invest $6200 worth every year into an investment yielding 3.5%,  and reinvest the returns -- since $6200 is 12.4% of 50000 ? 
6200 * 1.035  ^ 49 + 6200 * 1.035  ^ 48 + 6200 * 1.035  ^ 47 + ... +   =  $805,987.04
At this point I would note  3.5% of 805,987 is  $28,209.
At that point the **interest alone**  on your investment -- $28,209 exceeds the amount that Social Security would pay you per year.
There are investments readily available that pay 3.5%.   For example,  EE  savings bonds are sold at 50% of their face value and guaranteed to be redeemable for full value 20 years after issuance ---    that provides a guaranteed 3.5%  return.
So you just need to arrange the bonds and their reinvestment schedule so that you have  $28,209.54 per year maturing after retirement,  AND the interest alone is paying more than SS without eroding principle.
This means that you could likely create an arrangement of bonds such that  $28,000 worth of payouts are maturing during a given year;  and you can  take out $25,000 while SS would only give you $22,   AND you have $3000 more to reinvest every year,   which will increase future earnings at a much higher rate than the inflation indices!
Since 3.5% is achievable as a basically Risk-Free rate of long-term return......   it reasons that anyone who has the slightest clue  as to finance can also find other acceptably safe ways of exceeding the 3.5%  in the long term.

Not really, no.    A pyramid scheme is a scam that promises geometric (exponential) returns to those on the top few levels as more and more people are recruited --- but after a few levels down, 
 the number of people that have to be recruited to payout their promised 100%+ return increases exponentially.     That is not what social security is.....   Because in fact   BEFORE you get any $$ from SS,  each beneficiary  has already PAID that money into SS a long time ago ---- AND your lifetime benefits received from SS are anticipated to allow  the SS system to still profit from you.
Everyone who receives benefits today is someone who already sunk more money into social security during their working career,   And the total amount that is paid out to each retiree is less than: What they paid in,  assuming the SS department earns a reasonable return on their fund that at least exceeds inflation  ----   the fund will Due to 
 each person's participation still have more money in it after their expected benefit is paid out   than if they never paid in.
So.... THERE ARE  reasons for SS to fail,  But not because it's a pyramid scheme -----  Because (1) The fund is mismanaged,   and  (2)  The fund has some special unusual benefits that allow certain special needy groups to get payments  based on a means test that aren't justified based on something they paid in  ---- for example permanently blind people with no income or assets can get paid out of SS disability without ever having put a dime into the system.

And it's still not income if you use the voucher for your personal enjoyment,  BUT  if those points or that voucher can be transferred to someone else,    And if you SELL or convey that voucher to someone else for cash  that year when it's worth more,  then you have a taxable profit -- ordinary income:   The cash you received  Minus the cost of goods sold -- the fair market value of the Voucher  when it was awarded to you.
Now with Bitcoin awards.......  there's really no way to use the awarded BTC points  EXCEPT to either  trade or sell them,  so if there's significant appreciation over time,  and that's what you expect,  then you can treat it as a capital asset,  then there will be capital gains;  Otherwise, if the BTC you're holding doesn't qualify as a capital asset or you don't keep the required record to treat it that way, then,  just like the voucher it's ordinary income when you sell or trade the BTC.
Probably the most advisable thing to do with BTC awarded like that would be  not to sell it,  but to go redeem it  from a retailer for goods or services,  before significant changes in BTC value can occur.

Well, so sure you could say it is infact an inflationary bubble come falling down, but Bitcoin is not a stock or derivative: it is in-fact the product, so the concept of "bubble"  just means short-term price increase or price inflation that is unlikely to be sustained,  and the drop in price we observe eliminates the bubble.
It's a valid assessment, so long as you don't attach other meanings to the word "bubble" --  just like US Dollars,  currencies have no "value",  only a "price" supported by current demand.
For a time in the US there was a housing bubble, but that doesn't mean houses are now worthless after a correction,  in fact "after the burst",  market prices in many cases are higher than they ever were.
And the demand fluctuation for BTC is clearly driven in some respect by media hype or anticipated actions of the Chinese government.
One could also describe the current situation of price falling as an "inverted bubble".    If the demand exist to ultimately support $5000US/BTC for example, but have temporarily been disrupted by market manipulation,  then the current price of BTC could be described as unsustainably low.
Ultimately the price depends on the population of users, which is expanding with Bitcoin due to the network effects.

Many credit cards offer a feature called "Balance transfer"  where you can write out a check for any amount up to a high percentage of the credit limit and deposit the funds directly into a checking account -- there's usually a 4.5 to 5% fee for the service, and occasionally there are promotions where the rate of interest you will owe on the balance transfer will be 0% for 12 Months,  as long as you keep up on all the required minimum monthly payments -- don't default on the debt, and pay it off completely before the last month of the promotion.
After advancing the funds to your checking account....  assuming you intend to and expect to be able to afford to repay the debt and haven't lied to the CC about your details such as income,  then you can spend them however you want,  even on Bitcoin,  although this is not how I would suggest funding your Bitcoin purchases --- it's technically an option, and these added restrictions won't make it impossible  (Assuming you don't discuss your intended use of the transfer funds with the CC company before they disburse them to you).

Just to extend this further --- take an example person.  If you bought $1000US worth of BTC at   $19,000/BTC and sold nothing, then today your 0.0526 BTC is worth US$405.70  --- that means for just $1000US more spent on buying you could get 0.12948 more BTC, and increase holdings to  0.182 BTC,  which is   3.5x as much BTC as you got when you bought the first time.....   if the price of BTC then later recovers and reaches a new ATH of say $20K,  then your  0.182 BTC will be worth $3640;   which would make your overall return 82%.
On the other hand if you decided to just HODL without buying more,   well at the new ATH your 0.0526 BTC would be worth $1052.00 - giving you a total return of 5%.
So  "Just HODL"  is a naive idea and not a great trading strategy -- spread those buys out in time to avoid buying near a local peak AND/OR when there are periods of price decline ---  selling at specified price decrease thresholds can be smart to try and limit losses.... buying more at some point when the price is lower is necessary -  AS-IS selling some at at some points where the price is some percentage higher than when you had bought that quantity.

Because most new people who would come in to transact with Bitcoin are just holding a small amount of BTC for a short period most likely to make small transactions,  and then there's a random (but tiny) capital gain or loss for every transaction moving into and out of BTC because of the volatility.  
It makes sense the government should not require account for this,  unless you are transacting a LARGE amount of BTC per year, and your purpose in those transactions is to profit from price changes over time,  rather than for normal trade.

All this manual coin splitting with an untrusted process is risky, and I don't think i'd do it for a 1%  gain from Altcoins ---  if possible,  delay doing this as long as feasible,   and your trusted hardware wallet vendor  will likely eventually provide a  "splitting feature"  if the AltCoin turns out to be important enough.
Otherwise: this is the right strategy - NEVER extract and submit a private key online  to someone else  or to some website,  Before you have verified  there is nothing remaining in  addresses controlled by that key,  And any outgoing transactions have multiple confirmations  (not merely "spent").
To coin split use two TRUSTED wallets and make sure the losing wallet is emptied to the new trusted wallet BEFORE extracting the old wallet's private key and sending to a website or new software:  After this point the Old private key is to be considered SPOILED and never  re-use the Old wallet --  It sounds like the original poster's mistake may have involved moving  coins back to an old wallet after the private key had already been spoiled.

Also,  the less he sells it for in dumping on the market **the more opportunity he gives others**  to  get BTC at a discount,  and hopefully  there will be more unique buyers,  thus resulting in the BTC ownership becoming more dispersed and distributed to a larger number of holders.
Overall, this is a healthy thing for the ecosystem.    It is a very bad idea to have concentrations of ownership of  large quantities of BTC  by  individual funds, corporations,  or other  Single large holders,  as in the long run that inevitably  is downward pressure on the value.
 
So while the large sales may temporarily ding the price of BTC by a large sum;  in the long run,  it is  very good for BTC  to   eliminate/reduce the influence of yet another fund holding massive BTC, going forward.

We can say with high certainty that Moore's law is over for CPUs and transistor miniaturization.
If you are suggesting some breakthroughs could make brute-forcing finding all possible keyspairs within 256 bits feasible  or testing every element of a 2^160 set....  that is far more a matter of extreme wishful thinking  than anything that is remotely feasible to happen.
This is equivalent to making a statement  "Instead of a power grid -- in 1000 years;  just about every person will have their own personal terawatt nuclear reactor in their basement"
And no,  that is not feasible either,  economically speaking -- due to scarcity of resources.    There are certain things that technology can do,  and there are certain things that are  "hard engineering obstacles",    which cannot simply be overcome by new tech.

Except in fact it has finished;  Intel has already provided that development has slowed,  and 10nm is **far** overdue,  although they are soon to come out finally.
And Capital costs for every new line of processors are getting higher and higher --- such that every later CPU generation becomes more expensive than the last,  See **Rock's Law**  or Moore's Second law that says the cost of a Chip Fabrication Plant doubles every 4 years.
* See: [At some point it is believed]( that Moore's Law and Rock's Law will     
 












There's no appreciable speed increase for the new process node coming out either --- a few decades ago in the development of computing we were seeing &gt;100% speed increases from one CPU generation to the next;    these days the latest CPU is out,  and we're supposed to get REALLY excited about a 1% to 5%  speed increase.
Just about the only way Intel has to entice consumers with new CPUs  now is **longer battery life**  Or  fixing hardware security issues that they conveniently forgot to fix in older generations.
99% consumers aren't wanting for faster speeds these days, so there's  no real demand either.
Most major advancements are in  ASIC Cryptocoin mining, Network processors, Quantum computing, GPU technology and solutions for Machine Learning/AI Deep Learning Neural networks  ---  since those problem spaces  don't have well-optimized solutions,  and general-purpose CPUs suit these problems poorly -- that there's a lot of money in solving;   a lot of development resources shift away from general purpose computing And being able to solve problems like  "brute forcing" a SHA hash.
High-performance computing begins to focus High core-count solutions such as  32-core CPUs for Cloud and VPS hosting Providers such as Amazon, Microsoft,  Rackspace, DigitalOcean, etc  --- these CPUs are not any faster,  they just pack maximal numbers of cores you can fit on a chip for high density in large data center environments ----  and  those CPUs are and likely will always be  priced way out of the range of consumers'  pocketbooks,     Because 
 End users' computing is moving to the cloud  and being controlled more and more by bigcorp's.  with more walled gardens,   more systems that will only run vendor-supplied or vendor-approved and signed code,  with  fewer and fewer opportunities to make or run general purpose or custom software  --whether end user's like that situation or not.

Insider trading is only illegal when dealing in securities: the ownership shares or debts of a publicly-traded corporation regulated by the SEC,  which prohibits trading based on material non-public information.

Assigning someone BTC is something like assigning them Warcraft gold.  Nobody knows what that is, and it's not necessarily going to be worth anything.    On the other hand,   after you transact BTC to someone, if they then find an exchange and convert it to cash,  Or buy some good or service,   then there absolutely will be a  fair market $$$ amount of  that Cash or Good or service.
Also, when Bitcoin is more widely adopted and there's a massive liquid market for it,  then at some point the price is likely to be less volatile, and then there will be a "Fair market value" of what a Bitcoin is,  so you could say definitively....

That's fine.  Selling out 1 of your wallet addresses worth millions of Bitcoin is not a crime, and you will have reported the income properly;  the IRS can come audit you, and your taxes will be 100% on the up and up. 
The other "990 million worth" of Bitcoin will not be income,  because you never traded it or sold it,  and the appreciation on an asset is Not income, until after you sell the asset or profit from the appreciation --- you either assigned the property to a foreign trust with nothing received in return,  or destroyed the bitcoins by locking them up behind code that won't release them back to you until sometime after the 3 years;  either way,  you don't currently have legal control over the remaining Bitcoins, so you wouldn't have them to report,   even if they asked for an accounting of all your unsold assets that might have appreciated.

You can impose required alimony  Plus child support on the working spouse for a number of years,  but that may be effectively just a poverty sentence for them too,   because your rent payment for housing doesn't go down 50% when you divorce ---- and now your spouse needs to go get housing too.
Obviously  ALL marital property,  even Bitcoin will  need to be settled out fairly between the parties,  and then  both spouses will likely need to sell the bulk of the valuable assets they wound up with  (and pay taxes),   if the additional money will be  needed  to  make timely housing payments to the landlord

Because you need All the benefits of bitcoin JUST to persuade merchants to accept it -- they think they're already doing you enough of a favor.    Also,  chances are the merchants are using a payment provider to accept their BTC and convert to fiat, which  tacks on their own percentage fees to every transaction comparable  or even more than the fees of an equivalent CC payment.
Plus the merchants have to deal with the headaches of a completely separate refund process --- that's a lot of administrative overhead,  when probably 99% of their business is still purely in fiat.

That is not true, but a common fallacy regarding quantum computers ---  they are  Not "faster" or able to be made denser  than other computers,   and they still subject to fundamental physical limitations.    
The inspiration regarding quantum computers is a reduction in time complexity **for a certain class of algorithms**;  specifically --- algorithms whose execution can be modelled as NP problems which are equivalent to a physics problem that a computer with the quantum logic gates would be able to solve   with the a number of basic operations that would be on the same order of the number operations  that a normal computer could solve a P problem  the same size in.

Who said anything about never "recovering" ?    If it doesn't die completely because of fundamentally failing or  "losing buyers' and merchants trust in the tech",  then  it can recover.      Nothing has happened to BTC (so far) that it cannot recover from;   although at times it has come close to that situation.
Look..... the level of interest in Bitcoin was increasing at too fast a rate -----  it was by far surpassing rate of development of the technology,  and further developments to BTC's ecosystem are still necessary before the technology has any hope of scaling to its potential;  to do what it is billed to do  AT THE RIGHT SCALE  for  the mass buy-in that has been starting to occur.
All the trading activity ALONE was overwhelming the blockchain infrastructure and resulting in  fees corresponding to a ridiculous amount of $$$ required to get a transaction through with a reasonable delay.
All the selling does is shake out some BTC owners who were JUST   weak-handed HODLERs or ASSET TRADERS chasing the latest fad:  brand new to the ecosystem  hoping to pop in and pop out in 3 months with a 1000% return,  and the asset price going nowhere but a straight path up ---  while having no understanding of the technology that is cryptocurrency, it's potential applications, OR the problems of fiat  that it might help with, and just trying to come in to Buy Buy Buy an asset for a quick profit.
For  Bitcoin to reach the next  *LEVEL* of adoption;   we need to see  scaling concepts,  for example "Lightning Network" and SegWit  reach maturity AND adoption  by all the major merchants, exchanges, and payment processors.
Then we need to see some milestones reached such as  1000 Transactions / Second.
For all this to happen BTC also needs to become easier to pay with for more people AND more attractive among the public to pay with than alternatives.
"Internet cash for the unbanked",  OR   "A less-expensive alternative to using cash to buy a prepaid card or moneyorder"    are some concepts  that  could   cause more adoption among some demographics.

Ah...  accepted/approved  doesn't necessarily mean the merchant will get paid.     It just means the credit card hasn't been reported stolen or de-activated by the bank.
You COULD do the same thing with Bitcoin...   at the store,  get their ID and billing address,   and verify a valid transaction has been broadcast to the Bitcoin network  ----  the instant the transaction is in the mempool,  and you confirm the fee provided is what you agreed to,  you go forward with the sale as if paid,   But if the transaction fails in settlement,   you either lose your money  (part of the cost of doing business),   Or  you  attempt to collect the debt from the customer,   Or if the customer did a double-spend, then maybe you get them for fraud -- kind of like using a bad check or stolen CC where the transaction will  Not only be reversed in settlement - but the merchant will have to pay their bank a $50+ fee per reversed or bounced transaction.

The price of all crypto moves down with BTC, thus  an appropriate 'hedge' against BTC  would be:
(1) Investments in any companies or assets whose valuation seems to be going down or being suppressed from the market due to competition from crypto,  Or who stand to compete with BTC or profit from BTC's demise -- E.G.   Stock in  Services like Venmo, PayPal, Credit card companies, Banks offering 'pay to e-mail' features, etc.

In an earlier thread on this article I did the calculation based on the SS benefits formula and showed that if you saved that money for yourself,  then  at least before paying the income taxes on your benefits you would be able to pay yourself more for a longer period of time **just from the interest** than SS would pay you in total,  AND  if you saved the money yourself you'd still have this lump sum at death,  eliminating the need to carry any life insurance, 
 so you could roll the $$$ you WOULD have used to purchase term life insurance into your savings program as well,  and it would become effectively permanent self-insurance.




Because the option to save using an IRA is relatively new --- it's a superior option.    The only thing missing is a law waiving your obligation to pay into SS  if  you pay at least that amount into an IRA,   But because of government mismanagement the SS trust funds have been facing insolvency for a long time.....




That's not fundamentally different from how any annuity works --- the funds of everyone paying in are pooled,  and the payouts come from the pool,  BUT    the formula used for calculating your benefits  to be paid out from the pool require  you to have paid into it  More than enough to sustain the pool ---  assuming the fund is managed appropriately.


What do you think happened to the funds the Boomers/Silent-G paid into SS?   The money doesn't just vanish.     More money has to be paid out over time due to inflation,   that's why  pooled funds are invested in the bond and stock markets for growth though.

Only if Marital property was used to obtain the Bitcoins,  for example money earned from a joint account or money working at a job after the marriage.
Sometimes people who marry have pre-marital property,  Or personal assets they obtained from a gift such as inheritance, that they specifically keep separate and don't  use for marital purposes or mix with or intermingle with marital property ---   if the money used to buy Bitcoins came from one of those accounts,   then   the spouse doesn't have right to any interest in that property  or incomes that property generates.
On the other hand if the Bitcoins are marital property,  then in a divorce settlement they're going to be under obligation to report them for sure   And  share at least the purchase price +  any capital appreciation --- and failure to declare the assets would be fraud.

Yeah, and because of AML rules... excessive churning is potentially dangerous, since the professional risk managers and bankers at the banks tend to have a lot of disdain for these kinds of tricks:  even if it is legal and profitable for you  --- churning, or "Making a full circle"  out of funds to exploit any 3rd party systems tends to result in anomalous patterns in a depositor's account that makes them unlike normal peoples'  bank accounts and creates extra pain and tedious work for the very people at the banks who generally have sufficient discretion and decision-making power to decide to force-close the account if they want: the banks don't have to, and some won't tolerate much if any churning shenanigans.... the banks can make a business decision to close any individual's account that is causing them undue trouble or generating much paperwork or man-hours filling it out and they will..
TL;DR "Smart people" were exploiting openings in CC companies' systems --- that is profitable in terms of $$$,  but puts them at grat risk of having all their banking shutdown for repeated behavior that appear suspicious or high-risk and costs bank time and money filing SAR reports that go to the federal government.

Income tax is a tax on TRADE, and yes, even transactions made with tokens or non-currency are taxable.    It is not the use of US currency that causes income to be taxable,  IN FACT, you could leave the US go work in Spain for a few years for pesos, AND all your wages would be taxable,   because your Worldwide income is taxable in  its fair market value in USD.

You'd probably be better off looking at price changes over time for a "Basic 16-channel cable package"  than for the TV itself;  and average that with the change in monthly cost for a basic POTS phone line having no added services.
The 50" flat screen from 2000 is probably CRT or Plasma  Standard Definition with CFL backlight.   The 2016  flat screen is probably LCD and lit by LED backlighting --  1080p High-Definition.    There's a huge difference both technologically as far as what they can do AND at the component level,  regarding what they are assembled.
So if the price is different.... you can't untangle Inflation from changes in technology and changes in what people are willing to pay for both the functional and non-functional developments.     That doesn't mean inflation has no influence --- but inflation is not necessarily the largest factor in price changes  for long-lasting durable products.

Wife gets discovery order and pulls all the bank statements,  then shows a withdrawal with Coinbase;   Wife's  attorney subpoena's Coinbase,   and  Coinbase shows  100 Bitcoins purchased.
The preponderance of the evidence is then that the husband has (and may be hiding) 100 coins  ---- unless  the husband can show otherwise,   the  court will find  that to be an asset within the husband's control  they can be ordered to hand over,  OR  they can be ordered to hand over an amount of cash (US Dollars)  equivalent to the current fair market value of those alleged Bitcoins   PLUS some large penalties  for perjury and attempting to defraud the court.
There are ways courts can force you to cough up cash someone  was shown "hiding" outside their control --- one of them is  called contempt of court,  where you go to jail indefinitely until you comply with an order;  in a lesser case they can just revoke all passports and driver's licenses,  and  enjoin you against visiting another state or otherwise leaving your local district  until the matter is settled.
Existing bank accounts can be levied,   so the husband can't actually  spend any money   (the husband's banks will accept deposits like Selling 100 Bitcoins  but  deny any attempts to withdraw any money).

No....  In theory some advances may occur -- but not to that extreme, since there are limits that come from physics regarding how much computing power density is even possible.
It's not reasonable to forecast technology defeating physical constraints -- like the laws of thermodynamics  Or the limited availability of electricity on planet earth.  
Further advances are a matter of diminishing returns.  ---  80% of the computing power  humans can potentially develop per cm^3 of chip material which requires rare and precious resources  has already been seen,  so  the idea of  a 1000x increase,  let-alone the idea of 1 CPU eventually being able to brute-force a significant % of the keyspace would be absurd.    I don't know if you have realized it or not yet,  but  the days of Moores law for CPU density increases  has already ended.    X86 CPUs have Not gotten **significantly**  faster  in almost  10 years,  and it seems like it's basically the end of the road,  with further developments concentrating on  power efficiency improvements  or  stuffing more cores in  using  3dimensional placement   ---- Even if  in hundreds of years from now a new CPU model's development COULD  find a way of  beating the physics and  stuffing more elements in:  A fundamental limit on computation includes the  Necessary minimum power consumption for all those operations.

Insider trading is only illegal when dealing in securities: the ownership shares or debts of a publicly-traded corporation regulated by the SEC,  which prohibits trading based on material non-public information.

Nah... Coinbase is a business, and they saw an opportunity to generate more exchange transactions resulting in more opportunities for Coinbase to collect fees  -----  A lot of BTC holders got BCH from the fork they didn't want;  a lot of hard-line BCH holders would want to chunk their BTC;   it doesn't matter which side of the split "wins" --- the exchanges win   when the community's agitation results in churn.
Because Coinbase is an exchange;  the price of BTC changing doesn't really hurt them,  what they care is the number of transactions to swap between cryptos or between cryptos and fiat,  since they collect fees every transaction.    The IDEAL  market for Coinbase would be one where half the crypto holders start selling off their crypto for fiat  or trade to another crypto on CB every few months gradually using as many transactions as possible,  and then come back and buy back in their crypto position or change cryptos again using as many transactions as possible to maximize the value of CB's  per-transaction fees.
They exchange collects fees when BTC holders trade their BCH in for BTC or Fiat....  they collect fees when BCH holders trade their BTC for BTC  or Fiat:     New forks,  and   the community  splitting in half  generates a hell of a lot of churn which is a huge opportunity for the exchanges.

No.  It was completely an arbitrary number, just like the original maximum block size,  total number of coins,  difficulty adjustment schedules, and block halving schedules are arbitrary numbers.  the choice of the 10 minute block time was a design decision;   In making a design decision,  there is some justification for it  that exists only within the context of THAT system's design ---  the justification for Bitcoin to have 10 minute transactions  does NOT mean that other designs  related to different blockchains which incorporate a different block time are necessarily broken and does NOT mean they are sacrificing something important...








So, basically you are ignorant and you just assume there is a stability sacrifice involved in Litecoin's choice of blocktimes....

No I am not, but you have just described yourself, apparently.


No, but the ability to stand on the public street or public school grounds with a sign in your hand is a right,  and a private person cannot legally force other people to leave or assault them based on the content of a sign they're carrying, regardless if  "Staff" is their job title or not.
Whether some ESPN staff person could tell a student "no you can't come inside the stadium with that or not",  may be more questionable;  if the sign is legal and not obscene,  and the school is allowing similar signs in by other people,  a public school probably doesn't have a right to override the students' free expression right in that;  particularly not ironically in a stadium, which are typically taxpayer funded public venues.
In other cases, the school may be lending some indoor private spaces as private venue, where students are not invited to express their messages,  but in neither case  do event staff have any kind of right to physically interfere with the content of a student's  sign   while the student is in a public space.

It is mostly Small service providers such as repair shops and small eBay stores with dodgy customers, where potential customer chargeback abuse is a cost of doing business,  but honestly -- if a chargeback is occuring, that relationship is soured,  and the potential cost to reputation of a former customer spreading "information" whether truthful or false is the bigger concern,  and one bad review can have a bigger $$$ impact than many transaction reversals.    
For a  normal retailer:  if a customer comes in asking to return the goods providing a receipt,  they are basically going to get their refund -- with little or no questions asked,   as long as they  follow all the store policies,   So your  "chargeback reasons" -- are basically,  Unauthorized/Fraudulent use of card,   and it's a small price to pay for those compared to the risks  involved holding BTC would have.

In the same manner as if you receive a share of stock or bond from a company in exchange for services -- it is still taxable  as if you received the face value at the current prevailing share price on the stock markets  at the moment the sale is committed.
If you hold X units of Bitcoin,  then it is considered property.  When you own property  (or cash) and you exchange it to someone else and receive a good or service, then a **taxable event** called a **SALE Of Property** has occurred;   depending on  your cost basis in the property this can result in a deductible loss or a taxable gain.
In the eyes of the law, a property sale is equivalent to a cash sale. You might owe Sales Tax, Income Tax, or any other number of taxes.    The tax is a **separate debt obligation** that you have to pay to the national, state, and/or local governments,  so the tax will always be in the currency required for the payment of taxes, regardless of what kind of property you used in the trade.
The value of the items in the trade is determined by **Fair Market Value** at the time of the trade.    For items such as Stocks, Bonds,  other Securities,  common Commodities,  or Bitcoin  that are available on multiple public exchanges ---   the   Fair Market Value is defined as the  **prevailing market price**  across  the exchanges at the time of the trade;   you may have some discretion regarding how you choose to say what the FMV was  as long as your procedure is demonstrably consistent and not biased in your favor across your transactions,  however,  the government may later reject your way of deciding the FMV and use a formula of their choosing.

Not if it is a FOIA request, and the  timestamp, computer name, author name, etc is information that does not fit within an allowed reason for redaction.
The public is supposed to be receiving the complete record as stored  minus only the **allowed redactions**.
All  I mean to say is if  the data is stored as digital text,  and you release it as a scanned image of the body,  
Then in that case, you're witholding the record well outside the permitted redactions  ---  changing digital text into a picture of digital text  greatly changes  what can be done with it.
For example: I mentioned excerpts of the text can no longer be copy-pasted into a text document,  and the Find function will no longer work.
But there are other issues ---  the document is made inaccessible to the blind, while the original would have been accessible,  since assistive devices can read and speak the text in a PDF  but  can't  read and speak the text in a picture.
Finally, the text can no longer be automatically processed while the unredacted document could.   The authority to redact is not a carte blanch right to impede access to the public record;  Or convert the public record into less useful data formats that destroy information or cause information to become non-readable by computers  (Other than what was allowed to be redacted).

Well, so sure you could say it is infact an inflationary bubble come falling down, but Bitcoin is not a stock or derivative: it is in-fact the product, so the concept of "bubble"  just means short-term price increase or price inflation that is unlikely to be sustained,  and the drop in price we observe eliminates the bubble.
It's a valid assessment, so long as you don't attach other meanings to the word "bubble" --  just like US Dollars,  currencies have no "value",  only a "price" supported by current demand.
For a time in the US there was a housing bubble, but that doesn't mean houses are now worthless after a correction,  in fact "after the burst",  market prices in many cases are higher than they ever were.
And the demand fluctuation for BTC is clearly driven in some respect by media hype or anticipated actions of the Chinese government.
One could also describe the current situation of price falling as an "inverted bubble".    If the demand exist to ultimately support $5000US/BTC for example, but have temporarily been disrupted by market manipulation,  then the current price of BTC could be described as unsustainably low.
Ultimately the price depends on the population of users, which is expanding with Bitcoin due to the network effects.

I suggest securing your offline wallets with strong encryption so only you can read those.
Create a special wallet designated just for your beneficiary.
Create special offline media for your beneficiary.
Place both into separate  Tamper-Evident deposit bags. 
Create 2 sets of these.     Put one in a safe at home.    Put a second one in a safety deposit vault with a bank.
On one the offline media designated for your beneficiary, you place a copy of the wallet, AND the other a  series of  pre-signed  offline transactions  that will transfer your coins from cold wallets to the beneficiary.
(Do  TEST the offline transaction creation and redemption process with a tiny amount of BTC  before preparing  production offline transactions.)
For the production offline transactions you should set the  **nTimelock**  field set on the transaction into the future far enough that it will prevent your pre-signed transaction from being broadcast onto the bitcoin network until after 18 to 24 months in the future.
This means nobody can quietly use your "beneficiary materials" while you are still alive,  unless you are incapacitated and unable to detect that one of your caches has been tampered with  ---  that way you can share the instructions ahead of time with your loved ones without worry,  assuming you will not access the offline coins in the interim (thus invalidating offline transactions).
If for some reason you detect tampering or can't get to your beneficiary materials to verify they have not been accessed, then you can invalidate them all by decrypting YOUR version of the wallet and spending enough coins to a new wallet to void all the inputs.
Every 12 months,  you  generate a new set of  offline Time locked spend transactions to the beneficiary wallets,   and   destroy the old Time-locked spend bags,  after confirming  that  none of the  Tamper-Evident bags have been opened or messed with.
Next, create separate documents  containing  detailed instructions for at least two trustees/friends,  But not your actual safe combinations  or decryption passwords,   and provide the paperwork for them to look over and keep safe.
Your beneficiary wallets should be encrypted.    You can have more than one beneficiary wallet with different offline spend transactions and different passwords for accessing.
You can use an M of N scheme where you have N trusted friends, and M  are required  to supply their share of the password to unlock, certain wallets in addition to holding your offline media.
Make sure you think your plan through thoroughly and walk through the whole thing testing technical details using something like 0.0000001 BTC transactions at first.

See a tax professional/CPA.  
The gain of $11,000 From Selling in 2013 would be taxable income for that year --- If that 11k is what you sold (after subtracting your cost).  You can expect to be charged a rather hefty underpayment penalty PLUS interest for for 4 years.
It's likely not going to be too late to admit that your return was inaccurate and be assessed the penalties  but at least potentially avoid criminal charges....    As  for selling at a loss in 2014,  ordinarily: a maximum of $3000 in net capital loss can be credited against income year and the rest may be carried forward to the following tax years,   BUT it is probably too late to amend this return  and claim those credits,  Therefore,  the opportunity to get the tax credit for those losses  is probably gone, forever.
But perhaps an experienced high-priced CPA representing you to the tax authorities could find legal means of  getting the records set straight.

Based on the filing for this registration, the proposed ETF will provide an experienced professional management and security of the crypto assets:  providing better protections against investors suffering losses due to theft, fraud, or accidental loss, etc;  regarding the cryptocurrency assets in the fund VS  crypto assets that can be purchased and held by an individual...

That's bad,  because converting to an image or "scanning again" turns the document into a non-document,  for example:  the "Find" feature no longer works,  and text can no longer be selected and copied from the document  ----  In other words,  you've mangled any metadata and wrecked the release in other ways besides redacting what is allowed to be redacted,  which  is not supposed to be allowed.
The right way to redact is to first overwrite the text being redacted with nonsense text,  and apply the black marker styling to that.
Or if it's already an image,  then select the redact region and apply a heavy blur filter or  replace all pixels with RGB(0,0,0)




If you are going to re-scan,  then you cover with opaque black tape, or use a black liquid paper/wite-out or other correction fluid or paint that fully covers:  not a marker.

The US law defining the [wash sale rule](  specifies the rule applies only to stock or securities  including options on futures;   It does not apply to physical commodities, currencies  or other types of property.
The rule is designed to prevent traders with appreciated portfolios from  keeping all their gains tax deferred  by selling something at a loss equal to gains being realized, and refilling the loss position with more shares or an option  every time  they sell something at a gain  ----  Because,  presumably,   the shareholder  expects a future price recovery in the stock  they will take the loss on.
And the wash sale rule requires the seller take a risk  that the shares may appreciate while they don't own them  by waiting  30 days before they can re-purchase to avoid a wash.
Again...  This rule  preventing you from realizing a loss does not apply to currencies  or other kinds of property, and only applies to stock shares  and  related securities  (Futures,  Options on Stock,  Options on Futures, etc).

The US has some pretty tough regulations in this area --- any bank, broker, or payment provider that does business with a US National becomes subject to the jurisdiction of certain US laws -- that's one reason many banks are now refusing to open accounts for a person from the US,   because the reporting obligations are cumbersome.

Actually,  the median is an average.    When you want to create an "average";  you have a few different choices --  some of the most common choices for a list of numbers is to use either the  mean,  the median, or the mode, for example,  as the average.

Well, to short... it depends if you're an individual investor or one of those large brokers: in the past,  some large entities were known to have cheated by doing something called "naked short selling" --  where the broker  "sells stock",   then on settlement day simply fails to deliver the shares,  abusing the 3-days delay between trading and settlement to synthesize temporary shares of stock that don't actually exist.
For mere mortals to short something you need a margin account to short stock,  since by shorting you enter into an obligation to rebuy and deliver those shorted shares at some point to make up the short position -- and the  "margin"  is an amount of cash in your account including the  value of the short position + a percentage   that your broker secures as collateral  to help reduce the possibility that you lose so badly you cannot repay the broker.

Maybe, but your article also hinges on:


Which I'm saying:  A fork is *arguably not* a realization event.
And even if it was,   the argument has still not been shown to say WHICH side of the fork should receive the  $0  basis.
Following a fork where a market or community split is involved --- proceeding the fork it is a misnomer/false thing to call  EITHER  chain resulting from the fork   by the same name the chain had preceding the fork.
Following the Bitcoin Cash fork,  it would be more accurate to call the two coins    "Bitcoin-A" and  "Bitcoin-B",
Because NEITHER coin that results from the fork is the same as the coin preceding the fork.    Ultimately it is up to the community and the marketplace to decide which coin will survive,    and if  one of the coins  continues  by the old name  it is only  through a  casual agreement with the forking parties that   "This chain is more likely to be the dominant one,  for now".
Because a portion of the community contends that  Bitcoins are the (A) side of the fork,  and another portion of the community contends that Bitcoins are the (B) side of the fork.
It's TOO ambiguous to say that  the percentage of people who believe the (B) side of the Fork will be the successor   should all move forward with a $0  cost basis for their Bitcoins,  and  people who believe the (A) side of the Fork will be the successor  should  move forward with a $0  cost basis for their Bitcoin Cash.
Why is it not a realizing event?  Because  realization as defined by Section 1001(a) and (b) of the IRC sets the definition of realization to be **an exchange** transaction through which the taxpayer receives money or other property.
Arising from the legal disputes, the Supreme Court limited "realization" events to 4 kinds of occurrences:
 * A property exchange
 * A relief of debt or legal obligation owed to a 3rd party
 * Relief of a legal obligation owed to a party receiving property, or, 
 * Other profit transactions.
Among these, only the fourth could conceivably apply to a Fork,  BUT it shouldn't,  since **A network fork is not a transaction**.
In all cases,  realization requires a **transaction**,  to which  the one  "realizing"  a gain or loss is a  party to this transaction.
A Fork is not like a dividend,  or other thing,  where value holders "own shares", "bonds", or other "debts" in a corporation,  that in theory entitle the shareholders legally to a share in the company's profits,  which the company legally owes the shareholders,  and  the corporation in theory makes joint decisions  where the shareholders and management agree    at what frequency and rates the regular dividend payouts will occur ---  Thus a  Dividend or Interest paid on a bond is a property exchange that satisfies a legal obligation of the company or debtor to the shareholder or creditor,  therefore these payments are realization events,   BUT a fork is not like these,  since 
 there is no party that has a  legal obligation  to create forks or  distribute forked coins.
The Bitcoin miners **do not even have a fiduciary duty** to users of the network;  they act upon their own interest,   And  there's no operation by which address holders have a binding vote or agree to assign a vote in the outcome of  system changes,  such as those leading to a fork.
A Fork does not involve a **transaction**  which the address ids involved conduct an exchange of property,   conduct a transaction on anything,  make any kind of decision,   and it's not a transaction in which a fiduciary or joint group of  address id owners makes a decision to transact  "on behalf of"  address holders.
What is a fork?
A fork results either when there is a disagreement within the market between different computer systems  or miners,  and the participants in the network that run the protocol,  AND they result in the same participants holding their value in   multiple Alternate coins.
Forked chains either exist persistently or die or aren't formed at all by operation of the marketplace,  and the  holder of  an address id with forked coins is not  'a party'  to a transaction:   doesn't necessarily have any say in it  ----  and may not even become aware of it,   because there  is no communication involved.
In theory there can be 1000 forks of the Bitcoin network which the public has just not become aware of yet.

The US-based exchanges are still providing a useful service many people need,   and Bitcoin users should still be encouraging newbies to use *ANY* exchange that best meets their needs  and can most easily get them Bitcoins.
Coinbase is absolutely fine providing their main service --- an easy-to-use exchange  and trading platform;  just DONT expect to  Spend directly from your CB wallet.     Users are best served buying BTC on Coinbase, and then immediately transferring crypto to their own private wallets for spending purposes.
Many people exist in that environment,  and many people have a practical use for the services of Coinbase and other exchanges that exist  INSIDE  US jurisdiction,  because exchanges outside US jurisdiction cannot so-easily deal with and take deposits from US sources:   there are also nasty compliance issues for any US citizen wishing to do a significant amount of business with an  outside-jurisdiction exchange;   not to mention US banks restricting the use of international wires,  charging exorbitant fees for them, and freezing accounts that do much movement of funds in and out of jurisdiction.

The reason it is a bad example is of course you didn't pay NOTHING for the new generation farm animal;   firstly  you bought the first generation farm animal,   and you wouldn't have the 2nd gen farm animal without having the first,   so the price you paid is attributable to both farm animals,   And secondly,   there are costs from raising the newly birthed farm animal   including providing the ongoing feed to the parent and baby and facilities required to birth the farm animal and sustain its successful survival  until the time of sale.
IRS Publication 225
* Livestock: Livestock held primarily for sale must be included in inventory. 
* Livestock held for draft, breeding, or dairy purposes can either be depreciated or included in inventory. Also see Unit-livestock-price 
 ethod,
* Unit-livestock-price method. This method recognizes the difficulty of establishing the exact costs of producing and raising each animal. 
 You group or classify livestock according to type and age and use a standard unit price for each animal within a class or group. The unit price you assign should reasonably approximate the normal costs incurred in producing the animals in such classes. 
* The costs of animals are subject to the uniform capitalization rules.
* Uniform capitalization rules. A farmer can determine costs required to be allocated under the uniform capitalization rules by using the farm-price or unit-livestock-price inventory method. This applies to any plant or animal, even if the farmer does not hold or treat the plant or animal as inventory property.

Assuming you bought 1 Bitcoin for $100 in 2010  and did nothing after any of the forks
Your  1 Bitcoin today has   1 BCH in Additional units (fork coins);    the BCH might or might not be worth anything,  but your total Cost basis for  the BTC and the BCH combined is  $100.
If the 1 BCH is worth $1000 and the 1 BTC is worth $8000,  and you sell the  1 BCH today,  then the cost basis should be   $100 * (1000/(8000+1000))   =  $11.12
Since your sale amounts to 11% of the asset,  the level-averaged cost basis would be $11.12
And the left over cost basis for the remaining BTC is now $88.88.
Which would be a true reflection of the  cost of the unsold proportion.

The current situation is most likely:  Under investigation and believed to be guilty of crimes against the US,   But may currently be outside of reach of prosecutors to bring them in  ---   Law enforcement and Treasury authorities in the US  still have the power to stop banks US from dealing with an overseas entity:  prosecution of a crime or being found guilty in court has not been required  to use this power for a while.

One of the issues is,  this loses you the advantage of tax-deferred gains, if you have them.    Suppose at this point if you've held Bitcoin up from $100 or so,  then selling at  $2600 will give you  $2500*X   in taxable income.    
Where X is your number of BTC units.
Buying back at 2100  will not erase this income,  and you will need to do some basis calculations,  since each transaction gets 1099B'd.
So you could be adding   approximately  $800 * X or so to this year's tax bill  for  $400 * X in   early profit,  in that example.
If you can withstand that  800 * X  increase to your tax bill,  then wouldn't it be better to just put the extra money  into buying more coins,  so All that money can continue working for you tax-deferred?

There is a fundamental problem with this argument of a taxable event or setting basis to $0.  (A)  You owned BCH before the fork,  and should set the cost basis on the Bitcoins of $0,    OR   (B)   You owned Bitcoins before the fork,  and you should set the cost basis of the BCH to  $0.
The same arguments that would make (A)  true automatically make (B)  true,    and   it's not possible to do both!
That is it's just as much a fallacy to say you didn't have "BCH"  until the fork,   as it is to say you didn't have  "Bitcoins"  until the fork.
"Bitcoin Cash"  was just a name  some of the community members gave to the  value on  that version of the Bitcoin chain,  and likewise,       "Bitcoin Core"    was the name   some gave to the other version of  the chain.
So you could say
(1) Your Bitcoin  BEFORE the fork is Not the same as  EITHER  Coin after the fork,  and,
(2) Your Bitcoin BEFORE the fork is BOTH  Coins after the fork,  and,
(3) The COST BASIS  on your asset  is   the basis for your COMBINED  value  of  BOTH  sets of coins    that you have,   and,
(4)  When you sell  one of your sets of forked coins;  You're going to need an accounting-consistent system of allocating that Combined cost basis to your sales    other than merely pretending the basis is  $0  on one of the forks.

This is probably the safest thing to do in case of a fork - make sure your coins are in an Offline wallet under your control before the fork --- avoid spending.
Following a fork where you wind up possessing multiple competing coins (e.g. 'Legacy Bitcoins' LBTC and 'Segwit Bitcoins' SBTC):  do not spend anything  to someone else,  until you first create new separate wallet addresses for your coins on each chain,  and move the coins  on each chain to your brand new wallet addresses,  which are different addresses on each chain,  And wait for your movements to be confirmed on both chains.
Otherwise, there exists the possibility that if you send someone else BTC, your recipient could receive your payment in Legacy Bitcoins,  snag a copy of your signed transaction off the network,  and re-broadcast it  to the other side of the split,  e.g. the Segwit Bitcoin Network,   which is perfectly valid if your same wallet address on both networks   has the coins.

So you think there are many things with **value**,  But do you also think there are some things with **intrinsic value**?
A major point I am concerned with is that Value and Intrinsic Value are not the same thing.
Many economists constantly stress that Gold has zero intrinsic value.   The same applies to fiat currency, and government-printed money as well.
So what Does have intrinsic value?
I get the idea that things with intrinsic value  are being defined as only things which humans have a **functional requirement** for in order to survive.
Example:  Food,  Clean Water, Secure Shelter/Clothing/Protection from the Elements,  Self-Defense,   and Tools such as Drinking Glasses,  Tractors,  Rifles and Ammo,  which are necessary and directly involved in obtaining one of those things humans must have.
Those are your things with intrinsic value,  then your things with non-intrinsic value  are other things that humans fancy --- such as Paintings, Costumes/Fancy Clothes/Adornments/Jewelry,  Music,  Sports/Entertainment/News Media, Video Games, Etc.
These things have value, but it's aesthetic value.    So you could say that Gold and Currency and Bitcoin have zero intrinsic value, but significant aesthetic value.

Every support request to turn off or change anything about 2FA or just authentication *IS* a potential attack.
The problem is, responsible people can take steps to perfectly secure themselves,  BUT   other idiots  design companies' support policies --- Also,  companies' support policies have to be designed so the company doesn't lose the business of  people who have issues with their authenticators and 2FA process.
The Exchanges could make me really happy if they would adopt a policy that once 2FA has been in place for X days:   Any changes to  authentication,  or Buy/Sell/Transfer/Change orders  will be rejected outright, if there have been recent logins to the account.    If there HAVE been recent logins to the account (within past 30 days), then the only requests support will respond to will be a report that the account has already been compromised and request to  Freeze the account or Cancel/Reverse a transaction or Undo a recent change.
Removal or change of long-time-established 2FA MUST NOT be done by support   without Notarized letter and form authorizing it   Or at least authenticating to the system using  Original Password + Some other factor such as a One-Time Code or PIN created at the time 2FA was enabled and for contacting support.
An easy "2FA Recovery" or "Turning off 2FA"  through the website or through standard support  should require the use of some PIN number or One-Time code created when 2FA was enabled  that the customer was mailed or  instructed to write down and never forget.

It sounds like you were getting gouged in 2007.    My home internet was 15 Megabits/1Mbit and $30 a month in 2007.   In 2017  it's $60 a month after several price increases, and I still only get 30 Megabits,  and now there's an official   250 Gigabytes/Month usage cap that the service did not have in 2007.
If you look at getting bandwidth for datacenter servers and ISP transit between providers though,  the needle on the cost of data transfer has barely moved at all since 2007.
For transit bandwidth  average cost per megabit, somewhere between $2 and $3/Month from most providers on BGP ports,   versus  $6 to $7   back in 2007.
 Max speed on a home internet connection is also not a good measure, though,  because  residential ISPs all overcommit their bandwidth,   And they turn off, throttle, or charge overages accounts that use too much,  and a Bitcoin node  requires its bandwidth consumption 24x7.

Email is inherently insecure,  so a financial provider assuming that the ability to receive an e-mail message is proof of identity would be reckless behavior on the provider's part.
If the provider allows insecure communications to request an account change and does not adequately  authenticate the request, then that is totally on the provider.




Financial providers are responsible for their part in securing access to their online services;  If they provide an authentication option and then do not enforce it,  then that is deceptive and/or fraudulent behavior on the part of the financial provider.
And **Of Course** the provider is responsible if they make changes to a user's authentication details that the account holder did not authorize.




None of this relieves Bitfinex from their responsibilities  to Not disclose Or make changes to your usernames, keys, or passwords  without proving they are authorized by you, the account owner.

BTCs are a scarce resource required to transact on the blockchain; to use Bitcoin as a manner of exchange.   So long as people are using Bitcoin as a medium of exchange: Some measure of BTC will have value, and that value will not be zero.
People could claim the demand and price people are willing to pay is higher than it ought to be, therefore you have a bubble,  But so far no rational argument has been shown of that.
By the same token you could claim the entire US stock market is a bubble, because of such seemingly-high price.   Again,  "what a high price" is is just some random person's opinion, it is irrelevent without backing up your argument.

As a holder of stock with no intent to sell: you get all the shares from the split,  so  your amount invested doesn't change at all, unless you did something dumb like sold off additional shares received in the split.
The $1.50 is actually the split-adjusted price;  share prices are totally relative. 
So your $10,000 worth of Amazon stock purchased in 1997 would actually be  6667 shares today   which is worth more than 6 Million bucks.

My suggested starting point is find a bank with a better CD deal.   There are banks offering 2% CD interest  for a 5yr CD;  at that rate $10k  would yield an extra $16.66/Month.
Or ALLOCATE (divide funds)... EG 75% CD,  23% Stocks,   2% Dangerous stuff : put  $7500 of the money in a 5-year CD at 2% (guaranteed to yield $150/Year over 5-years) and  $2300 in  Stock-market  total-market ETFs  (Expected in general to earn average 5 to 6%  per year,  Or   $115 - $120/Year over 5yrs).
Finally, you could suggest they put $200 in Bitcoin,   which could yield anything  from       - $40/Year  to  $1000/Year average over 5 years,  honestly.

What is your criteria for saying that Ethereum is a bubble and Bitcoin is not?    
Is it because of the volatility?    Is it because you think the technology doesn't work,  and you're not satisfied with the reasons people in the market have for demanding it?
Maybe.... just maybe...  all Cryptocurrencies are hard to value,  and it is gauging the level of public interest and the number of people who want some  that decides price and worth.
I do see there are  6x as many ETH units as BTC units in circulation.  So if the currencies were valued equally,  then  Bitcoin should be  6x the price,  but instead  each BTC is about 7x the price of 1 ETH.

F yes.   Before giving.

Add a copy of the public key to your wallet for monitoring,  and when they spend the coins away --- burn the envelope,  otherwise keep it safe.

Most of the investments industry defines "A gamble"  as an investment whose expected return over the long term has a high Risk,  and Risk is defined as a high standard deviation  (Meaning the market cannot accurately predict how much cash this asset will be valued at in the future).
Something that is volatile has a high standard deviation in its value, which also means that it is a high Risk, or gamble.
A good investment or fund manager is a person that provides customers the maximum level of return at a specified risk level: 
ANYONE can proportionally increase the level of return with added volatility or risk, and the common way is just by increasing leverage  (E.g. Buying on margin or borrowing money secured by  your other investments as collateral).
So  Forex and  buying cryptocurrency units such as Bitcoins have some similarities in terms of market volatility,  and will be viewed by professionals as a gamble.
That said,  Bitcoin could be a sure thing,  but the market and society as a whole has simply not recognized this so far.
People who are convicted in this belief should consider leveraging personal funds to acquire and maintain personal positions in Bitcoin ---   Just not for other peoples' money,  when you have a professional responsibility to those other people  and could be blamed later potentially for  "reckless"  management choices.

Actually... that's impossible to say.   That depends on how much a BTC winds up being worth.     I would agree  that the ability to instantly create more liquidity on demand might have some more limitations,  on the other hand banks are perfectly content swapping IOUs around  instead of actual cash,  and consumers need the same IOUs to transact,  so it's likely a Bitcoin owned could spend the vast majority of its lifetime as an IOU with no  very infrequent need to physically manifest the coins.

But back in 1997... I didn't have $10,000,  and even today I don't have $1,000 to make on bets that are negative-expected-return high-risk,  low-chance of success.
Might as well say  "I wish I had bought a ticket with numbers

If someone will please tell me  what High-Stakes bet I should be making  and how to go about establishing enough confidence in the correctness of that bet to make it low risk,  then please advise,   But i'm skeptical that it is possible.
By the way,  buying and holding $10000 Bitcoin today would still be just as high-stakes high risk a bet as it was in 2011.    A BTC could go to $100,000 US  or it could go to  $0.
There are still forseeable events such as  UASF BIP148,  possibility of ETFs, government regulation, more bad/powerful actors getting involved,   block halving in approximately 3 years,  Etc,  that could make or break BTC --  it's entirely possible to be replaced by an AltCoin.
But hey...  High-Risk + High-Stakes =  Big Payout if your thesis happens to be correct.   Buying  $25,000 worth of BitCoin in 2011 would be like betting it all on black,   but you'd have a small fortune today.

It is true, BUT  the Federal reserve was not introduced until 1913.   People had been doing fractional-reserve banking the entire history of the US and before then since the 1600s,  and all the currency had been "backed" by something,  until the relatively modern invention of fiat.

Actually you can.    Suppose "Bitcoin" becomes the unit of account.   You open an account with your bank denominated in Bitcoin,  and you deposit 100,000 Satoshis.
Your bank  assigns you account number 1234, transfers your Bitcoin cash deposit to their bank wallet and creates an entry in their database saying "Account 1234"    "Balance: 100,000 satoshis" --- Indicating that the bank has a debt to you as a depositor of 100k Satoshi.
A borrower comes to the same bank to apply for a mortgage.   They want to buy a house that costs  5,000 Satoshi...     they do the paperwork,   and  the bank    creates an  "Loan Account 1235 ,  Balance: -5000 Satoshi",     then hands the borrower the check made out to the Seller.
Next,  the seller of the property hands the 5000 Satoshi check to their bank,   and their account is reflected to show the bank has a debt of 5000 Satoshi to the seller.
At  this point,   100,000 Satoshi exist,  but the Bank has  debts in the amount of  105,000 Satoshi  to depositors,     and the person who borrowed the money  has a debt to the bank of  5000 Satoshi plus interest.

Yes.... exactly.  Just like the same system works if the money is gold, etc.     Bitcoin as a currency AND  skipping the bank entirely using peer to peer accounts are totally different concepts.




A bank is solvent if the value of its assets exceed the value of its debts,  and it is able to meet every obligation which is actually presented to it to be paid.
Just because some assets are at risk does not make the bank insolvent.    Just because in theory a run on the bank could cause its ability to pay from on-hand supply to run out  when it still has debts does not make insolvent.
However,  right now as things stand,  people are  more likely to transact through banks,  because it is what they know.




The bank can have literally hundreds or thousands of online and offline holding wallets,  and  just by keeping them undisclosed, they can prevent depositors learning the exact details.

The depositor would see that his money moved to one of the bank's wallets.     The money would have not moved again on the blockchain,  unless the seller of the property has their account with a different bank.




Ah,  but the bank is not insolvent.    the bank owes  105,000 Satoshi to depositors in that example and has   100,000 on hand,  plus the borrower's obligation to pay 5000 + interest;   If the bank needs to deliver all 105,000 for some reason,  the bank can borrow 5000 more from someone else and still be solvent.
The only issue that would occur is if the depositors wished to withdraw  so much BTC   that the on-hand supply would be exhausted.
That risk can be managed in similar ways as with USD though:  FDIC/3rd party insurance.    Required reserve ratios.
Finally,  interest-bearing accounts (Savings Accounts) and CDs that pay interest and have  restricted withdrawal terms or financial penalties for early withdrawals to encourage depositors to park money with the bank,  instead of in physical assets.
Now because there's a more limited worldwide supply of BTC,  the ratios and safety thresholds might be set differently,  for example  3:1 reserve requirement instead of 10:1 reserve requirement,    and withdrawal restrictions on CD savings might be tighter.
ex: You pay a 25% penalty on early withdrawal.   The extra interest is earned _because_ the bank can further lend out that money.    Then most depositors are unlikely to take their funds early, and if they do, the penalty closes the risk gap.

If two forks of the blockchain both survive,  and you had Coins in your wallet before the fork,   then  your same wallet ID (Public/Private keys) will exist on both chains and control the same number of coins  ---  They are now two different type of coins you control on different variations of the Bitcoin blockchain.
To spend your coins:  the normal procedure is that you create a spend transaction to transfer coins to the Wallet ID of the person you are paying and sign the transaction using your secret key.    You then broadcast your transaction,  either on your own Bitcoin node, or someone else's Bitcoin node   (Some public node operators have a web URL you can visit and upload your signed transaction to).
When your transaction is accepted on the network,  miners will eventually pick it up and include your transaction in the Global ledger,  Bitcoin's transaction history,  recording that you spent those coins.
However,  after a fork:  your  "Spend"  transaction  including a spend of only coins mined before the fork  would be a valid new transaction on EITHER variation of the Bitcoin network,  so it just needs to be broadcast by anyone that has a copy of the transaction.
If there were two forks;  Bitcoin-A Coins and Bitcoin-B Coins,  then
Depending on how you push the transaction,  it could appear on  Fork A,  Fork B, or Both.     So your one "spend" transaction could wind up spending  either Bitcoin-A coins, Bitcoin-B  coins, or Both  to the recipient.
If  BOTH  coins continue to evolve and have value,  you don't want to spend  Bitcoin-A  coins at a merchant  and then find out that  merchant   managed to get your transaction published on both networks so they claimed  Bitcoin-B  coins from you too,  that wasn't part of the deal!
So what you want to do is "Split"  your Wallets containing before-the-fork coins to a unique wallet with Bitcoin-A  coins and a unique wallet with Bitcoin-B coins.     That way when you later send coins to a merchant,  you are transferring ONLY the  A or B coins, you expect to transfer.
To accomplish this,  you make  a new Wallet ID  with separate Public and Private keys  valid for each blockchain.
Then you need to find a way to move your Bitcoin-A coins but not your Bitcoin-B  coins to your A wallet,   and next move your  Bitcoin-B coins to your B wallet, but not your A coins.
Either you have a way of broadcasting your A coins transaction and B coins transaction  directly to a mining pool or other full nodes  that only participate in a particular fork,   OR  you arrange to receive and/or  combine your spend transaction with a very small quantity of 
  Newly-mined coins   (Thus you make a MOVE transaction on the Bitcoin-A network that cannot be repeated to the Bitcoin-B network).
After you think you've done that, you should wait  a fair amount of time for  15 or so blocks -- to confirm your split is successful,  and one of your moves didn't wind up on both networks causing the other to be Rejected as a Double-Spent  (Cannot spend the same coins twice).     Or you could use a  3rd party service to help you.

Basically, yeah... if they're in your wallet and only you have the secret key,  then you can spend your coins to a new wallet you will create on each chain --  you'll want to make sure each of the spends only appears on its respective side of the fork.
That's the problem;  the risk is if both coins become viable and both chains survive;  it will be easy to accidentally spend both coins,   Because if you spend your coins to someone else,  the recipient can receive your signed transaction and Replay it into nodes supporting different sides of the split.
Most people will probably require the use of a splitting service or an exchange that will split your coins for you to do it safely.
Although you could create for yourself  a new set of Bitcoin wallets one for each chain,  and  then  create separate transactions to spend to each wallet -- the challenge then is to get your transactions distributed one to Bitcoin network nodes that will forward to only miners on each respective chain.
Then you will need to wait for confirmations populating your two separate wallets before you could confidently say your coins are safely splitted into the BTC and the BTC-Alt versions.

There's ONE reason for a large mining operation to rent capacity in a customer-profitable way:  Reduce negative float  and let them see a return on their investment sooner.    By collecting an upfront rent they get immediate cash,  and the cost of getting that cash early is their profit is reduced  (Shared with the people buying the contracts)  ----  so they could finance a large amount of equipment and other capital costs by selling contracts,  and the contract seller can go home with profit on month 2 or month 3,  instead of month 12;   Whereas the delay to profit is transferred to the buyer of the contract,  And  their profit is small....
The problem is that there is so much demand for cloud mining, and people buy these contracts without regard to profitability and risks --- that they are able to actually sell under terms where the people buying these contracts don't have enough built-in profit to make up for the risk they are taking.
In other words: Cloud mining WOULD make sense,  But  the demand-hype in the marketplace prevents this from happening,  since there are too many other people willing to buy these mining contracts even if they will lose money --- that it is almost impossible to buy a mining contract  that is likely to have high profits for you,  or alternatively,  that guarantees any profit  or offers any protection of your investment against difficulty changes.

Fine with me, so long as the issuer does not retain an ability to issue more, And the central authority does not gain technological capabilities to rewrite history or rollback transactions.

I actually agree with them in part.... be VERY CAREFUL with digital currency as investment,  Also, be very careful and do your due-dilligence with any investment.
With cryptocurrencies,  you ought to understand how they work, what they are, and what major risks are before you buy Bitcoin, Etc.
For example:  How to securely store your coins and not leave them on some shady exchange.

Right now it offers an advantage of lower latency.    If it offers no advantage,  then  why should it be valued less than Bitcoin?    It seems the high transaction fees for Bitcoin are a setback, and by the time they get fixed,  there may be more people using Ethereum.
We already know of some major companies such as Microsoft picking Ethereum not the Bitcoin blockchain as the technology to develop on top of.

Yes.... it sounds like a great idea,  But i'm not positive it would work out in an actual calamity.   Remember, for a time Gold ownership was banned in the US.    In search for a scapegoat politicians will look to anyone who prepared and want to call some people "Horders";  maybe act to ban BTC.
I think just holding BTC will not prepare you,  as the electricity or internet may also go away.
Best to join the whole Prepper movement if you anticipate major calamity.   Although truly preparing can be ****** expensive.

Another option is brokerage and then CD, Bonds, or MM funds.    Brokerage funds awaiting investment are protected by SIPC which has much higher limits than FDIC.

The funds should be invested responsibly in accordance with the goals of the organization,  not simply  the  highest yield (Highest risk) options available ----  depending on how large the fund is available,  typical investment objectives for a non-profit are  preservation of capital:  which  suggests an asset allocation strongly allocated 60% or more in low-risk  Bonds, Money markets, and Cash (CDs),   with possibly a smaller portion invested in higher-risk selections such as Stock market ETFs or managed mutual funds,  and some very small portion might be using speculative assets, probably via investments in hedge funds.
Also, you should keep in mind that if the funds are invested in a totally irresponsible asset allocation and lost,   someone may be in trouble for abrogating fiduciary responsibilities,  since there's no way a significant % of a library's trust funds should be on high-risk bets.
A 10k CD is a good start for a low-risk investment,  but the choice of CD should be from a bank that pays a competitive yield, basically  1.8 to 2.18% APY for a 60-month CD is competitive,   the CD, Treasury Bond, or Money market type accounts are suitable for the "Cash" position of an asset allocation seeking to preserve capital, since they guarantee principal  (If the CD is withdrawn early, then probably only interest will likely be forfeited by the penalty).
If something like a Library will consider investing in hedge fund that holds some things like bitcoin;  it should probably be  5% or less of the total assets being invested.








Find a financial advisor/industry professional who knows something about it to discuss,   so you are not appearing to self-promote a special speculative asset class that you uniquely know about and are personally interested in more than the average person -- provide the understanding in writing....   Also, you might present the information,  but as a board member I would suggest not participating in the decision to steer library funds directly to Bitcoin,  if you are recommending this,  particularly if you yourself are already invested in Bitcoin.
Suggestion:  Look for non-scammy exclusive fund options with true Bitcoin exposure.

At this point, even being significantly better is not sufficient;  BTC was the first to market and has the larger network of people who know about it and use it or have it or accept it.

Storage and bandwidth.     And the people advocating here for larger blocks are VASTLY understating the cost of running a **Reliable** node, where reliable is attempting to assure say 99.0%.   Sorry, a stack of  6TB  hard drives in JBOD does not cut it,   Because your node will be down for months after a HDD craps out and you need to try to  re-download the whole blockchain over a  6 Megabit DSL connection,  and it will take more than a month to download 500GB - EG  1 Megabit/S Average Rate x 86400 seconds x 30 days = 316 Gigabytes -  In reality,  most DSL providers will kick you off if you sustain  1 Megabit 24x7... ---  Anyways: at a bare minimum, RAID1 is required.
$2 per month is  $12 a year: two years is $24.    That won't buy you a 1TB hard drive,  let alone the network connection to run it on.
If you're hosting  1TB of storage  the cheapest available would be Amazon Elastic Block stores, most likely  about  $0.045 per GB-Month;  in other words  512GB = $23/Month,   Before considering the costs of bandwidth and I/O,   Because  the blockchain requires not just storage but "Active" storage in terms of IOPS throughput......   Validation requires scanning all this data, which consumes IOPS, and it needs to be there and in good shape.
And the bandwidth costs here are significant....  that's when the price increase goes to $50/Month  for  2MB blocks,  and starts getting totally out of control with 8MB filled blocks.

If the developers resort to modifying the proof of work function,  then it will be a hard fork  which the miners will not be able to easily annihilate.     Also, if the POW change details are drastic enough, the world goes back to GPU or CPU-based mining,  and the hashing power of ASIC-Based miners evaporates,  since the hardware was designed against the original POW algorithm.

I think we need a network of Level2 aggregators built on top of the Bitcoin network as a second layer.     Where each aggregator network has their own separate blockchain.
And a procedure for using the underlying Bitcoin network to transfer coins between different  Layer2 networks,   provided a number of BTC has been brought in equal to or greater than the amount of BTC that can be sent out.
Then each of the aggregation networks needs a number of providers to service customer access on their Sub-wallet addresses.
This suggests a massive number of AltCoins,  and a specified number of  "True Bitcoins"  which  miners must spend at a pre-defined ratio of BTC to  Flavor-BTC for each block of Flavored-BTC mined.
E.g.  10000 Flavor-BTC =  1 BTC.

I would say try opening up discussion with your state regulators over banking,  or  the OCC (If your bank is a National bank),  about your bank failing to provide statements and refusing you to offer you the documentation on your accounts.

If that's true; I would suggest immediately seek out the advise of independent (non-commission-based) NAPFA advisors,  possibly after making a sale of 25% for diversity.     By the way,  "Moving up to a higher tax bracket"   only affects the income above the bracket level.
All the issues you highlight can probably be mitigated, and you can resolve your dilemma.

(1) What else can you tell us about what you remember about this wallet site?     Any memory about the site layout, Graphics, images, Etc?  
(a) Try to get as clear a picture in your mind about everything you can remember and start taking notes,   So you won't get your memories confused or corrupted when you start looking for candidate websites.
(b) Try forensic searches of your old media/computers,  to see if you can find any kind of history at all.    Surely you wouldn't place BTC with a site without making some kind of note at least?
(2) Google for Onion-based wallets such as OnionWallet, Torwallet, Etc?   "Anonymous bitcoin"  "Onion wallet"  "Tor wallet"  search for keywords like that ;  aggregate lists of sites, and visit different ones.
(3) Even if you work out the URL: don't get your hopes up too much....     The website may no longer exist.   3 years ago left in an online wallet is plenty of time for something bad to have happened.
Often times online wallet sites got hacked or turned out to be scams.    You would have been better off with Offline wallets  (and multiple backups).
