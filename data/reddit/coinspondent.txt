it's called personal rights and they accuse me of violating it with a very tricky statement. unfortunately law is not like math, where 1=1 and 0=0. it's all (well, not all but a great part) about arguments, definitions, comparisons and a lot of bla bla bla. And in the end a judge decides (a human, with (dis-)interest, good or bad mood, tired, bored etc.) which right is higher valuated in this specific case. The personal right or the freedom of speech. And history shows those decisions are sometimes weird with regard to the understanding of normal persons.

Right. Problem is, there are hell of a lot of factors influencing the judge's decision. And history shows a lot of them here in Germany are not familiar with internet topics. Sad but true.

how would you have managed it? I'm always eager to learn.

Ja, durchaus verständlich. Man könnte das so regeln. Letztlich geht es mir aber nicht nur um den Artikel, sondern ich sehe das als Chance dem ganzen Treiben von Onecoin und deren Anwälten grundsätzlich Einhalt zu gebieten. Es gibt durchaus einen einfachen Weg das zu klären, aber es geht mir auch um einen moralischen Anspruch, meine Glaubwürdigkeit als Journalist und um die Meinungs- und Pressefreiheit, für deren Verteidigung man im Ernstfall eben kämpfen muss.

I know that adress reuse is bad, but in this specific case it's also a way to provide transparency about the funds and what happens to them.
