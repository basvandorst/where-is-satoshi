Nice! I enjoying seeing people get into crypto in a way that interest them! Like any good business person make you manage your cost. 
Additionally learn as much as you can, this helps sorts out the noise from the real important information and helps you form your own opinion.

BTC is on the same route, its is a technology that is rolling with the punches, and needs time and effort to develop the kinks. So in the short term we have some hiccups, but with diligent developing we can address the issues that arise on the course of mass adoption.

Satoshi  doesn't use his influence or deceptive behaviors to push his monetary agenda. Roger Ver is going around trying to convince people why BCH is better, but if it truly was wouldn't the market naturally shift. IMO BCH is delaying the problem surrounding transactions, while BTC is trying to eliminate them.

because USD doesn't work everywhere. One of btc major appeal is that it can be used world wide. But if  everyone is exchanging it for fiat, then  how will it decentralize currency, how will it make us our own banks, how will it eliminate the middle man? 
I think the majority of new investors have no idea bitcoins main utility. We all see dollars signs and there is nothing wrong with that, but if we treat this as a "I can get rich quick" Investment, bitcoin will be doomed.

So once 8mb can’t support tx it will fork to 16mb and then 256mb and so on. Trying to run a node will become more and more difficult. It will take a lot of resources and only the big players will be able to, thus Centralization will begin.

bcash may seem bullish in the short term, but someday it may have the same hard issues btc has now. Btc it working to tackle those difficult problems, but it takes time. 
For me, bcash is dancing around saying look at how much better I am, but doesn't nearly process the same volume as bitcoin does now. Eventually they are going to run into the same issues, and will have to figure out how to scale.

I think its fair point. I can sit here invested in bitcoin and believe in the utility all day. We can keep sitting here telling ourselves: BTC is going to replace cash, make us our own banks, cut out the middle man, XYZ,  but if we ignore the roadblocks in the way and just keep believing in  the utility without actually using it, isn't this all a bubble? Bitcoin has value because of what it can do. To me, its not relevant who is bringing these issues up but these issues are relevant. 
When we solely become profit seekers with bitcoin then its utility is worthless. Its like trail mix in your camping bag. It has value, but If you never eat it ever  does that value exist, well of course it does, but not for its intended purpose, if you never eat it and you put it on stand by until you can sell it to someone else for more  than you paid, the only value that exist is in someone else wiliness to pay more for it. Bitcoins Scarcity is more valuable than its utility. 
Probably a shitty example, but its just IMO

It doesn’t have to be mutually exclusive. I do believe off chain solutions add more utility to the asset. It’s simple and easy to increase the block size but it essentially just puts a bandaid over the problem. 
Off chain helps keep centralization at bay while expanding the possibilities of crypto.

Ok btc is currently really popular and scalability is an issue, but this does not mean bcash is the answer. I'm not saying accept our fate with these high fees, but great things are not built in a day, they take time. Additionally a bandaid doesn't fix a broken arm.

For me btc is a developing tech. At first it was capable for transacting quickly and cheapy. I think the technical solutions to scale btc for the current volume are solutions that need time to develop. I rather them test and develop and be sure about the network they want to implement instead  wham bam something out real quick because people are begging for faster transaction. Great things are not built in a day, and I do truly believe btc will reach its end goal.

@_date: 2017-12-01 02:50:55
I agree. I just think bitcoin as community needs to define its purpose. We keep talking about paying with it, but right now that isn't happening. Blockchain technology  definitely has endless possibilities I just fear what will come once its all realized that bitcoin will not be a means of transacting. I am Defiantly not a Bcash supporter due to the puppet master, but people need to understand if bitcoin has very little utility then where is it's value? 
It could be similar to gold, but I fear the adoption of that mindset will be way more difficult to grasp in comparison by consumers. Gold has a cultural value, tangible scarcity, plus actual utility like jewelry.

Well you see fiat is currently printed as needed. With the limited supply of btc there is inherit value added. What I am saying is as the market cap increases, bitcoin is will become less and less  volatile. More people will own some, and it will take massive sell offs/ buy ins to heavily effect its price.

If had btc before Aug 1st, after the fork you would receive  equal amount of bch to your btc holdings. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:32:08
I see your point. I guess technically BCH makes sense, but politically and socially it has a stigma. It may be faster now, but if traffic increases we are seeing BTC 2.0.  Plus I don't want a coin with a CEO, or a face of roger ver. This is not want crypto is suppose to be like.

Hate is a very strong word. But he is using his money as influence in the wrong way. He is public advocate for BCH and uses his "Early investor into bitcoin startups" status to promote bcash. Also he has the domain: Bitcoin.(com) that promotes bcash. 
Imo he is very deceptive, and uses a handful of fallacies to prove why bcash is the true bitcoin. Also his tactics are very questionable on a ethical level.

I think it really depends on how people derive value. Yes BCH does transact better than BTC now, but what issues does BCH face coming down the road. 
I understand the appeal BCH has but at the same time  BCH abilities are not exclusive, BTC has the potential to transact the same or even better. 
For me if BCH was an organic development, I think the coin would be embraced easier. For me the stigma of an advocate such as Roger Ver throws all of its credibility out the window. I'm am very skeptical  of the campaign being run by BCH. Also market transitions should happen naturally not forcibly

This may not be the best place to give advice about Apple stock taking we are all Bitcoin enthusiasts. 
What I can say is that you should limit your risk and decide how much you are willing to lose. Bitcoin may prevail in the long run, but there is a lot of uncertainty around the current events. Also evaluate how much you have been making off of Apple to see if it is worth disrupting your investment and sending it over to bitcoin. If apples stock is paying off maybe don’t leave it all quite yet. 
If it were me I would take a portion out of Apple and make a big bet on bitcoin. DCA your large btc purchases, and ride the fork with the rest of us. No one knows the answers, but you can limit the risk of a investment. Diversification is the most import thing imo. If you have other investments, that’s great, but if not don’t put your eggs in the same basket, it may be tempting, but if you are willing to kiss it all away then pull the trigger.

My argument is that he is being played. Hyped up over the fact that this "new flash coin" is faster and better, plus I am very suspicious over the push to make it bitcoin. If it was the superior coin, wouldn't the market act more naturally and shift towards the adoption. It may be too early to tell. Another thing is, it seems that most people are in it to pump the coin, make money and dump the coin. What is going to happen to BCH come january when coinbase users get their BCH?

Gathering information from other peeps on the form and taking their opinions in, I think it will dip again but not below 6800. May be good opportunity to get back in then.

This thing: 
Youtube video about it: 
It gives you control of your keys, just more secure than trusting an exchange in the long run. 
And yes it is all confusing at first, I found that once I kept reading and researching it got easier. Just look up the things you don't understand, and get lost down the rabbit hole. Also don't take investment advice from anyone, like when to buy, when to sell XYZ

5k no way jose. I think it we will see a correction at 10k as well as a struggle to 10k. Big sell walls, not sure if there is enough enough demand. I could be wrong. I'm just a guy with internet access.

Either way 10k is great thing. More awareness, possible dip for the long hodlers to buy, and for the weak ones to sell. Can't wait to see the outcome.

But when someone does it on TV at a sporting event for strangers that is better? They're adults they can make their own decisions. By seeing "Buy Bitcoin" They more and likely will have to research it to know what to do, quite frankly that is what we want them to do. Learn about bitcoin. 
You must not have any, because this statement is so far from our cause. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:16:16
it will be okay, Seriously do you think you have caught the dip if you had the buying power? I know I would have messed up and bought somewhere high. We will just have to stay patient and see where the markets go, if you're in it for the long run it wont matter too much.

I'm in the same boat right now, kind of a blessing, I think I would have bought some coin at 7k+ but now I wish I had some buying power to catch this dip.

@_date: 2017-11-11 03:14:03
For me I think as the price gets higher the more comfortable i am investing into it. I am willing to  keep hodling and investing. In my mind I would love to see btc at 1 million, but I guess what really matters is the timeline. As much fun as it would to have a million dollars in my 20's I don't think it will happen. So maybe btc will serve as an investment for retirement, just depending on the timeline.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:48:54
Well said. What about historical trends? I see the same rally and fall, rally and fall, over and over. Obviously nothing says bitcoin has to repeat these steps, but human psychology may. We see the price hit the ATH then followed by some significant correction. Then the price creeps back up, but not so rapidly. Just my two cents, it may be worthless.

Idk what price you got in at, but I wouldn't risk selling just to buy at lower price, way to hard to time. I think you're right about the $7k mark, theres is a lot of buy orders at that price, there would have to be a lot of supply to knock it below 7. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:38:50

I see your point. It just seems after every huge rally their is a correction. This BCH drama is independent event unforeseen, and to me doesn't really meet the criteria of a correction, just FUD and mining profitability. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:10:33
Green= Buy orders, Red= Sell orders. More selling than buying. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:17:09
Thank you for this perspective. I should let the fun times roll 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:29:28
BCH looks like its having another pump and dump, also btc has a historical dip on black friday so people may sell and buy back anticipating a dip but thus actually feed the dip. Simple word for it right now: FUD
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:14:04
Invest if you believe in the tech boi. No one has the answers for you. Also if you're trying to get rich off bitcoin you'll have to be in for the long hodl, at which the price now shouldn't really matter. If you want short term gains, its really uncertain right now, nobody really knows. Learn the technology, and only invest what you're willing to lose.

Are you alive? 
Yes=Than yes. 
No=Then no. 
Invest what you can afford to lose. Better late than never. 
Brain exercise: if you're waiting for a big dip, think what is worth you time. 
If the price goes down to $8500 some how and you get 0.059 btc for your $500
Once it hits 10k you'll have earned: $88.24
vs $500 dollars at $9500 you'll have 0.052 btc
Once it hits 10k you'll have earned: $26.31
So is timing the market worth that $62 difference? Compared to $500 it's not significant. So IMO it's just better to get in then wait and have the price increase more and more. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:01:36
The business could offer a discount for you using BTC, since there is no third party. I mostly see btc being very advantageous for long distance transactions. Like transferring money country to country.

I agree. I just don't think bch adds any value in the long run, to me people are compensating the feeling of missing the rise of btc. They really believe bch can take over, but it really isn't adding any value to the network. It seems a like a feedback loop that will keep spinning until lucky ones stop getting lucky, or the rich find a new way to get richer. I guess I am sour, but I do think currently btc has the will to survive.

Nothing, Just possibly more risk, if you miss the dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:49:50
At the rate you want to invest really doesn't matter, I suppose that is more strategy. You could do 5 payments of 20 over 5 weeks. That would dollar cost average the price of your coin. What everyone is basically saying is just only invest what you are willing to lose. If it was me I would toss in $100 all at once, coin is pretty low after today, it could go lower, but hard to say.

For real. Bank fees no one likes but we put up with for what reason? Obviously I enjoy the physical security a bank provides for my assets, but companies are the worst at keep user information safe. Also running a business and paying merchant fees on cc transactions is just a waste. Consumers have learned how to secure their information with the birth of the internet. I think the same is possible with bitcoin. Also someone else's major loss has always been everyone else's learning lesson.  People need to buck up and not be lazy, but that's a lot to ask.

If you take the yearly low combined with the yearly high and average it out over the span of 3 quarter moons you can clearly see the correlation between the ups of and downs of the flexible costing. Now multiple this by the current daily waste of a bitcoin Reddit post and it equals a price reflected by the FUD combined with a magic 8 ball that knows all. The current analysis points to the possibility of more dipin' so more ripin'. My expert opinion is grab your chips, taste the dip, and keep being a pimp.

@_date: 2017-11-30 02:50:50
What a mountain to climb. I personally believe the utility of bitcoin has so much value, just tremendous, but it is being look at as only an investment and not a tool. I speak with peers about it and they have no idea what the tech does or they refer to bitcoin as a company/stock, like smh. That's why I think blockchain education is fundamental to the success of bitcoin. I think fiat and crypto can and will coexist but people need to embrace this relationship. Yes we want to make money on the climb, but  this idea has value because of the utility. If we just go "Btc is great because its like digital cash" but never practice what we support we are only capitalizing on the idea  when the real value is on the adoption of using bitcoin.

If you use GDAX you can see where the sell orders are being put in at. Right now there is about 170 coin trying to be dumped at 7250 range. Sometimes this is referred to as a sell wall. That's at least the way I understand it. Nothing is certain, so it is possible that the price could break out if the market is willing to but then fall back down to the resistant level. Basically there is just a lot of supply at the 7200-7300 range and not enough demand.

Add more risk, we don't give a fuck. Depends what your investment goals are. Yeah you can try to play both coins, a lotta FUD going on and you're more likely to lose twice.

Does any one have tips on securing a hardware wallet. I understand keeping the pass phrases safe and sound, but any other uncommon tips?

The transaction was confirmed. It didn't take long because of the small amount.

Like are talking taxes? I would assume you would have to recognize Short term gain or long term gain. The odds of being audited by the irs are slim, but if your a big hodler they would prolly have an eye on you.

Think with your head not with your heart. We all see dollar signs looking at bitcoin, but that’s in the long run. If you wanna get rich quick this isn’t it. Invest what you can afford losing and hodl.

So you think that btc is fairly valued at 7k? But the profit seekers ditching the game after Segwit2x cancellation drove FUD up and scared the btc phonies away? Where do you think the new base will be at? It been hovering around ~6500 last day and Idk if thats undervalued or over.

Do you think once a more consumable version of bitcoin arrives it will just create a third party thus creating more fees making it like PayPal? Like we see coinbase sorta heading that way?

Are you alive? 
Yes=Then yes. 
No=Then no. 
Invest what you can afford to lose. Better late than never. 
Brain exercise: if you're waiting for a big dip, think what is worth your time. 
If the price goes down to $8500 some how and you get 0.059 btc for your $500
Once it hits 10k you'll have earned: $88.24
vs $500 dollars at $9500 you'll have 0.052 btc
Once it hits 10k you'll have earned: $26.31
So is timing the market worth that $62 difference? Compared to $500 it's not significant. So IMO it's just better to get in then wait and have the price increase more and more.

Yes you were! Teach me your ways! Glad I was able to get in at 6550. I'm little worried about this growth though lol. This last weekend has me scared.

Forget regret, or life is yours to miss. I worry that profit and greed will kill the true tech. I mean, yes we want to make money, or we wouldn't be here. But let's not forget the utility.

Buy a little btc every week, so In the long run your investment cost is potentially less. Some would argue lump sum investments are better, but if the market is moving a lot DCA smooths out your cost.

I think I wasn’t apparent in my reason behind this post. I’m just kinda over all  these redundant post on r/bitcoin
I don’t honestly believe bitcoin will “crash to the ground” but In a universe that it does then at least we will have these quality post to remember bitcoin by.
