OK, I'm imagining the future, when the lightning network is pervasive...
My employer opens up a channel to me that will settle once a month, and funds it with at least as much as I will be paid for that month. Then on a daily basis they can transmit a transaction on the lightning network that increases my share of the balance.
My employer keeps much larger channels open with a variety of vendor and customer companies, so I can buy a coffee from my currently earned balance because Starbucks does business with a company that does business with my company.
At the end of the month my channel with my employer settles, and I get my pay minus my purchases deposited to the formal bitcoin blockchain. My company then opens a new channel with me for the next month.
This sound about right? You could adjust the rates of channel settlement or balance adjustment until both the employer and employee are happy. I probably also need at least a secondary channel into the rest of the world for the beginning of the month when I haven't earned anything yet but rent is due.

I was thinking of this as a possible feature for a wallet. Each receipt of bitcoin could go to a separate address and the exchange rate would be recorded. Then when making a purchase, the wallet would automatically select the most favorable address to pull from, based on today's exchange rate.
I think you might be left with bitcoins in your wallet that would be too expensive to spend eventually, though.

Could a mining pool be established in a non-mining-tax country, and then US miners could provide hashing power under some sort of subcontracting agreement? You would still be liable for taxes on capital gains, but the mining reward "happens overseas", and thus not subject to US taxes.
Right now this idea smells a lot of trying to avoid taxes, but it reflects the realities of mining. In physical mining, a state has an interest in collecting taxes upon resource extraction. After all, the minerals were in the ground in the country's territory, and are considered to be the property of the people to be administered by the government. But the block discovery reward lies in no state's territory. It can be found by anyone, and taxing it upon discovery just makes it less expensive to do in other countries.

Escrow and security of funds...
These are the "fatal flaws" of any currency. Until an environment grows around them that provides these services.
Bitcoin provides supports to those that would provide these services through scripting. I believe that this and Bitcoin's distributed nature will reduce true overall transaction cost (losses to unfulfilled orders, theft, etc.) for most classes of transactions by allowing any player to enter the "financial services" marketplace. Competitive organizations will find new and cheaper methods for security and order assurance.
Yes this will add cost to Bitcoin transactions. My bet is that it will be less cost than the current system extracts. And the fees collected can go to anyone, not just the banks and credit card companies that are in bed with government.

In an audit it would be your responsibility to provide some kind of proof. Per the IRS website:
"It is important to keep an accurate diary or similar record of your gambling winnings and losses. To deduct your losses, you must be able to provide receipts, tickets, statements or other records that show the amount of both your winnings and losses."
I believe that licensed casinos provide an IRS document to support wins or losses over a certain amount.

Scripting built into Bitcoin should allow something like that. It is possible to set up a transaction that does not execute until the full amount is reached, and if not reached by a certain time all funds are released back.

@_date: 2014-03-11 18:14:05
I don't agree that bitcoin seeks to solve a trust problem. To get trust you need something outside of the bitcoin protocol. An environment free of bandits and warlords for face-to-face trading, and something like verified identity and reputation tracking or escrow services for over-the-network trading. These are the same things needed for trading safely in any currency though, and independent of the currency itself.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:35:38

I know a lot of bitcoiners are opposed to the idea of banks being involved in bitcoin, but it is probably necessary. The computing security knowledge necessary to protect significant sums of coin is just too much for most people.
Maybe banks will pick it up as a way to reduce transaction costs, and hopefully pass the savings on. You're right, a user may never even know that bitcoins moved his dollars.
If banks do get involved, I hope that the bitcoin protocol makes it possible for new entrants to compete with them.

I answered above about a tool that I thought a user might like to have to print their own durable wallet before I understood that you intend to print wallets for other users.

If a bank operates with fractional deposits of bitcoin and pays me a percentage on money I am not otherwise going to use for a while, why would I not take advantage? I weigh the possibility of bank collapse and loss of my deposit versus interest to be earned.
Yes, some banks will overextend and collapse, more often the thinner they stretch their bitcoin reserves. But that is an issue of regulation within the jurisdiction they operate in, not a failure of bitcoin.

Well, you already mentioned paying interest. But "security" is a good word. How much sleep would you lose worrying about $1,000,000 worth in your own bitcoin wallet compared to depositing it with an organization that can afford to hire the best in security?
I agree with all your other bullet points, but they apply to any banking, it's just a matter of magnitude. I wish US banks were required to keep higher reserves. At least the blockchain makes it easier to confirm a bank's actual reserves.

I'm now moving from "experiment" mode to something more serious. I was also worried about my exchange being hacked. I would buy a small amount of bitcoin and as soon as the transaction cleared I would move it to my own wallet.
I think it's a good idea for someone starting in bitcoin to buy about $10 worth and start playing with it. Move it between wallets, look at the transactions on blockchain, learn how the transaction fees work. If you screw something up, $10 is not a bad loss. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:48:00

Yes, keeping bitcoin in a "bank" has disadvantages. Fees, reporting to governments, potential seizure of assets, etc. I bring it up as a useful service, though, because of the difficulty of personally securing bitcoins. I am very well educated in security issues, and I spend a lot of time and effort making sure my holdings are secure. I try to imagine explaining to my parents how to do this, and there is no way that they'll understand this in a hundred years. They will need someone to handle bitcoin for them on a professional basis.
I disagree that bitcoin can't be insured. Lloyds used to insure voyages around the world before the steam engine was invented. I assume that your policy holder will also insist on holding the bitcoins in their own wallet.
I know these things sound contrary to the "spirit" of bitcoin, but we must realize that there are tradeoffs to make. I can lose money in bank fees and asset seizures, or I can lose money in hacked and lost wallets or unfulfilled transactions. Hopefully I pick the right strategy to lose the least of my money.

I think it's a good idea, from the perspective of blockchain.info, to remove the brain wallet option. They need to protect their reputation and the modern press would be very bad at reporting who would be responsible if a customer had their brainwallet hacked.

If a customer loses their key it is a lot easier to explain to the press that for security they do not make copies of the secret that only the customer should know.

Are you American? In many cases you are taxed on earnings, no matter where they happened. I presume other countries tax their citizens in similar ways. Conversely, they also generally tax foreign workers working in their territory.
You may also be charged fees (taxes) on currency exchanges by the countries where they happen.
It's rare, but some countries (Cyprus most famously, recently) have taken taxes from bank deposits in their territory, no matter who owns them or what nationality they are. If you have bitcoins in exchanges or other online wallets it's possible that the government where their servers / offices / etc. are kept could force them to turn over a cut.
Trans-national finance, especially taxes, is really complicated. As it gets more popular, don't be surprised when any two bit country with some fiber and a router comes asking for its share of bitcoin taxes.

NSA identifies a target from which it wishes to steal money.
NSA puts malware on their smartphone. We know that they have this capability today.
Malware watches through camera, waiting for them to point it at a private key.
When a key is identified, it is sent back to NSA headquarters and the funds from that wallet are immediately swept into an NSA wallet.
The NSA need not manipulate the blockchain or Bitcoin protocol. All they have to do is break into a user's device. Of course you could keep your money safe in a paper wallet that you generated by hand with a slide rule, but if you want to spend it you need to put it through a computer that could be compromised.

I don't think that bitcoin will catch on as a currency until large transactions have been arranged. I mean trading a shipload of cotton for bitcoin. Or financing a construction project.
Once some large transactions have gained the attention of financial services companies and puts the fear of losing out into them, they'll start providing escrow services and insured wallets and other tools to make bitcoin useful at the personal level.

I hadn't thought to listen to the network for a double spend. You are correct, a soda vending machine could process a bitcoin transaction in a matter of seconds with minimal risk.
I still think that there possibly could be classes of transactions that might be better served by other currencies, but these are likely to be rare.

The big problem is that if you have a system that allows you to vote to restore someone's stolen money, it could be used to allow votes to move money for other reasons. And then you have a government.

I meant their reserves. If I find out my bank is holding 10% reserves I'll demand much more interest than if my bank is holding 50%. That's the advantage of bitcoin in banking that I wanted to point out: Transparency. They can't paint lead bricks gold. Everyone can see what they have.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:36:49
I do the same, I worry that they are running fractional reserves too. I have no proof, but when it comes to my money, I need positive reassurance that the operator is on the up-and-up.
I'm not opposed to making a bitcoin deposit in a Fractional Reserve Bank, but I expect to see interest commensurate to the reputation of the bank or to the regulations under which it operates.
Today's exchanges don't have this yet.

Say rather than a physical note you are talking about a deposit account. This could be insured by a government. Easier than trying to make sure you aren't leaking your private keys.
And fractional reserve banking would be sure to follow and you could earn interest in exchange for giving control of your bitcoins to a bank for a time.

I think that you'll get a "main" cryptocurrency (my bet is on bitcoin) and several altcoins filling niche roles where the main coin has limitations. Perhaps certain classes of transactions run smoother with a particular altcoin. ~~The most obvious one I can think of is buying from a vending machine: I want my coke now, and the machine is a lousy judge of my trustworthiness.

A vanilla savings account offers pretty pathetic interest, yes. But I have money in Certificates of Deposit that provide a respectable amount of interest, for money I would otherwise not be using.


This is not true. The US government currently holds a significant amount of bitcoin. And gold and silver and uranium and crude oil etc. They have many guns which they are willing to use.

@_date: 2013-11-21 22:30:46
OK, I read this as the "winner" is determined by chance if they send the transaction at the exact same time. It takes about three seconds for a transaction to propagate across the network. A node only accepts the first transaction it receives. ~~The "winning" transaction is the one in the most nodes.~~ *EDIT: I was wrong here, see response below.*
Send your transaction first by any measurable amount of time and you'll "win".
My scenario in this was sort of an action movie thing: our hero and the villain both find the paper wallet containing the lost key to the orphanage's donations during the climatic battle.

They'd be better off with a soft approach: Allow banks in their jurisdiction to take deposits of bitcoin from citizens. Insure the banks by holding reserves, investigating and prosecuting thefts of the banks, etc. In return the banks establish customer identity and provide the government with balance records.
Most importantly, the government does not investigate the theft of funds from private wallets.
Most average citizens do not have the capability to protect large amounts of bitcoin themselves and use banks. Those people avoiding banks tend to draw more audits. Some tax may be missed, but what you need is "most" tax.

He isn't talking about an NSA attack on the blockchain. The weak link is a user's device.

I don't think you even need the special structures you propose. The methods in place today could accommodate BTC as easily as USD.
The company I work for files an accurate record of my pay to the revenue service under pain of legal action. They withhold some of my pay for tax before I receive anything. This happens today for me in USD. Change the symbol in the company ledger to BTC and nothing else changes. It works because it is easier to regulate 1,000 companies than it is to audit 1,000,000 taxpayers and there is little upside for a company to cheat compared to the penalties.
Sales tax in America is collected and reported by the seller. Again, the process for doing this changes not one bit if you are dealing in USD or BTC. Most sellers are motivated to report accurately because of severe penalties for being discovered. And how do you know that the next customer isn't a revenue officer?
The idea that a government cannot collect tax unless it can trace the life of money from verified real entity to other verified real entity is nonsense. Governments collected tax, and maybe just as fairly, when money was gold coins hidden from view in lock boxes and traded in the dark.

Might be a good idea for Western Union and credit card companies and banks to get in on bitcoin, and serve as trusted escrow services or deposit holders.

Fractional Reserve Banking was invented by goldsmiths who issued certificates for weights of gold (not fiat) left in their custody. At the beginning they charged a fee for this, as they provided security against theft of the gold, but later they realized that not all depositors would claim their gold at once. They then put the idle gold to use and paid interest for deposits.
Banks failed sometimes, people lost fortunes, people lost lives. But that is risk, and exists in any financial transaction, fiat, gold or bitcoin.

This is not necessarily true. Population could recede, through falling birth rates or disaster or war. Also a competing currency could become more valued. Imagine a cryptocurrency that not only has the features of bitcoin, but solves the escrow problem. Don't know if that's possible, but I can't prove that it isn't
Disaster may devalue bitcoin, which cannot be eaten. Local events will drive fluctuations in bitcoin's value over varying timeframes. Rumors of recovered private keys to lost hoards might depress value for a time.
The value of other currencies fluctuate, but banking and loans happen all the time. The bank has to do its homework and make sure that it sells its loans for more than the cash would have been worth at the end of the term.
I suspect that bitcoin will encourage banks to hold more conservative reserves, I.E. not loan out as much money, because of the auditability of the blockchain. I can see both positive and negative effects of that. Fewer loans made, but less risk of bank collapse necessitating government bailout.

I thought about this problem some, and perhaps the best option would be to punch a pattern of holes in a thin stainless steel plate. Use an encoding like QR codes that has error correction. Make the punch strong enough to make two copies at a time, take one and put it in your safety deposit box at the bank.
The blanks should have reference holes pre-punched, and would have printing on them that indicate the area for the public and private keys.
Bonus points - an option to feed a punched card back into the machine to destroy it by punching out all holes.
EDIT - just thought of a possible security problem: an audio bug could hear the card being punched and might be able to re-create the pattern. Use in a soundproofed room.

Good point. Old-school banking has the additional failure point of a hackable central server.
However if I were the NSA I would avoid manipulation of the banking system at the server level for all but the most desperate cases.
If I hack a server of a bank in my country and I am discovered, I run the risk of destroying confidence in our banking system.
If I do the same to a bank in a foreign country and I am discovered, I run the risk of inciting war with real guns and death.

Money used to be hard cash, i.e. gold coins, and just about impossible for a government to track. Yet they could still collect taxes. Bitcoin won't change this.
If bitcoin gets really big, and you start to get your paycheck in bitcoin, your government can require that companies operating in its territory provide payroll records to the revenue service or even withdraw your income taxes before your receive your paycheck.
And if you get around that, someone living in a nice house with no visible means of income tends to draw audits.

Practically microscopic when using the bitcoin network. Currently something like a nickel, but possible for it to be fractions of a cent. Taken by miners that validate the transactions. More of an anti-spam measure IMO.
However as a buyer I might want to use some kind of escrow service. The seller knows for certain he got my bitcoins; I'd like insurance that the pound of coffee he sold me is of a certain quality and is delivered to me. That kind of service, when it exists, will add some cost to your transactions. This cost is currently taken up by payment processing companies or Amazon or whoever. But it exists regardless of what currency you are using.

I think that in the future most of your bitcoins will be in something like a bank, and harder to steal than they are today where you have to protect them yourself. Most people are bad at crypto and security, and could use a professional to handle this.
What I mean by a "bank" is service run by **known** entities that can be held responsible for the security of your money, by force of local law or because of mobs with pitchforks. I don't know if these banks will be fractional reserve, and pay you interest for the privilege of using your money to invest, or if they will be more like a security service, and charge you fees.
If banks evolve from what they are now, just handling a different kind of currency, your local government might provide deposit insurance. This might be beneficial to them, as now they can collect account information from banks for the purposes of assessing taxes.

As a government I have access to property records. Someone living in a nice house that doesn't appear to have a job draws the attention of my auditors.

This kind of assessment is done today for those who deal in barter rather than cash. Revenue services simply estimate what the barter is worth in local currency.

I disagree. In many ways it works like cash, but the blockchain is a very auditable transaction register. If you buy anything to be delivered to your home, expect that the tax collector will be able to track the flows of money.
Also banks might have a big role in the bitcoin economy. I'm comfortable storing $100 worth myself, but what about $100,000? Makes sense for me to have professional security for that. And then the government can insure the deposits in return for customer information.

I agree with the possibility of bank runs, which one might be prepared to risk in return for interest paid on deposits, but I think fractional reserves of bitcoin would provide limits to inflation.
A bank takes 100 bitcoin but operates as if it had 200. A run happens, people lose deposits, heads roll, maybe literally. The next bank decides to operate as if it had 150 for every 100 deposited. It stays stable. Equilibrium is eventually found. But a government can't "create" money to add to the system. Everyone can check the blockchain and see that the banks are honest about their deposits.

If the NSA has this kind of technical capability it is not a stretch to think that they can get their hooks into personal machines used for executing Bitcoin transactions. Even though we have good reason to believe that the network itself cannot be hacked, the individual endpoints into the network are incredibly vulnerable.

Careful, they call themselves:


And further down at the bottom they say:


Don't be fooled by pretty websites into thinking that you are dealing with a secure financial institution. Do your research: know who the company officers are, where they are located, what real assets they have.

So if you put a passphrase into Electrum and into bitaddress.org you won't get the same output?

Banks should get on board and realize that they could provide a valuable service: secure, insured wallets for a reasonable fee.

Look for a file called "wallet.dat". This should be where your keys are. You might be able to bring this onto a new computer.

Forgive me if I misread you, but I would think that Ticketmaster would hate bitcoin - an open financial transaction network. My take on Ticketmaster is that they unashamedly work to maintain a monopoly to charge highly profitable fees on every transaction.

~~Double spending problem. Unless the machine waits for a few minutes for confirmations you can attempt to double spend your money. But I'm not going to buy a soda from a machine that asks me to wait 10 minutes. I'll stick to quarters.~~ [EDIT: refuted below]

I'm sorry, but I am unsure of what I realized I was wrong about.
My basic assertion throughout this thread has been that NSA capability to hack traditional banking systems is not a good thing for Bitcoin. Ability to hack a bank implies ability to hack Bitcoin wallets. I have not changed my opinion on this.
That wallets may be hacked is not a reason to abandon Bitcoin, but something that must be kept in mind when using the network. No wallet is immune, although an attacker might have to expend great resources to compromise a well protected one.

Wouldn't this drive open warfare? I live in the US, I buy shares of Mozambique and then demand that they conquer Tanzania and take their stuff?

Banks used to do this. And they would charge you for the service of protecting your gold.
Later they realized that not everyone wanted their gold at the same time and they could afford to pay interest on deposits. They could use the idle gold and make investments with it. 
Today's banks have clear restrictions on withdrawal rates. The less flexibility you have to withdraw, the better interest they will pay. None promise to give you back the same banknote with the same serial number or the same gold nugget. They may not explicitly say how they'll use your money, but it's no secret that they won't leave it sitting in a vault.

I wish this would get more play in the press. Anonymous? OK. Untraceable? Absolutely not. If you ever buy something in bitcoin and have it delivered to you, you make a connection between your real-world identity and your bitcoin wallet.
Good article overall.

If you imagine that 7 Billion people will share 21 Million Bitcoins that comes to 0.003 per person. You are (potentially) fantastically wealthy.

Perfect currency? That's a bold statement.
How about a "pure" currency? Can be traded between anyone with no interference, has no intrinsic value beyond what people put in it (for example, beyond being pretty and desired, gold can be used as a good conductor of electricity).

You have it right.
But be careful. When you say monitor, it means you'll see money coming into the wallet. If someone cracks your wallet there's no reason for them to take just a little bit and let you respond, they'll take it all. If you have significant quantities of coin you might want to distribute them to multiple wallets, which might be what you are already doing.

*Full amount of bitcoins minted.
*The time that any and all bitcoin has remained "idle", that is, not part of a transaction.
*The size of any and all transactions ever made. Probably most interesting when measured against transaction fees.
*Statistics on wallet usage, number and size of transactions, time "idle". Mostly interesting from a technical rather than economic perspective.
To me, this is the huge advantage using Bitcoin has over other forms of currency. There is only an estimate of the amount of USD that exists, and that comes from teams of economists that bring their own political biases to the table. For gold I can consult scientists and engineers and get a pretty good estimate of how much has been mined and how much is left to mine and how much it might cost to mine, but still an estimate.
When I use Bitcoin as a currency I have full information on the amount extant, how much and how often it moves, a precise curve of the activity of existing tokens. Inflationary or deflationary I can't see how this would do anything other than help me establish what it's trade value should be.

Let's say I am a practical dictator. I see that my subjects are going to trade in bitcoin...
1)  Command my treasury to collect bitcoin, maybe through seizures from criminals, maybe by trading natural resources for it.
2) Allow banks in my country to take deposits of bitcoin from subjects. Insure those deposits with the treasury's holdings. Allow the banks to make a profit through fractional reserve banking with reasonable levels of reserves.
3) In exchange for deposit insurance, banks must provide the revenue service with customer account records, used to verify tax rates.
4) Allow companies operating in my country to use bitcoin for their payroll. Require them to provide the revenue service with accurate payroll records, again to verify tax rates.
5) Require my subjects that do not use banks or are not paid though a company to self-report income for the purposes of establishing tax rate. Audit them and punish cheats.
6) While the resources of my government are used to insure bank deposits, refuse to investigate any theft from private bitcoin wallets. If you want the protection of my government, use my approved banks.
7) Collect taxes in bitcoin.
tl;dr: Operate exactly as they do now. Give up the lever of printing more money. A government can still find a place in a bitcoin economy.

Besides a Coinbase account you can pay from any bitcoin address. I bought a bundle yesterday from my phone's hot wallet. Any way of checking on the contributions from this (non-Coinbase Bitcoin purchases)?
