Sounds like you are just desperate to recoup your losses. Maybe try gambling in a dice site instead?

Calling people poor like u/combatdev just because they weren't lucky enough to invest early like we have doesn't make you look good, though I agree completely that it isn't a ponzi. Bitcoin is of course a commodity, even the regulators think that. 
 
Bitcoin does have good use cases beyond drugs and other illegal businesses. It's certainly useful for gambling for example. It reminds me of the 90s during the early days of the Internet when the only businesses making money online were porn companies. Crypto is like that except replace porn with gambling. Hopefully just like the Internet, crypto will become more mainstream. 
 
Although I don't agree that crypto is a ponzi, there are tons of hodlrs that are hopelessly deluded and if you do say anything to shatter their delusion they'll lash out and babble about insolvent banks with zero self awareness of the reality that currencies like the USD don't crash 60% over a matter of days and take many hapless hodlrs underwater. 
 
I love crypto. I love the fact that it's decentralized. I love that fact that it can't be frozen or seized via civil forfeiture provided that you don't give up your private key. But I'm not going to willfully blind myself of its negative aspects such as insane volatility that can cause massive losses either. I'm a realist, not an evangelist. 
 
Personally I'll be much happier if crypto becomes stable rather than "mooning". Stability means it can be embraced for e-commerce use rather than being used as a speculative vehicle that isn't used in the real economy.

Is SMS confirmation mandatory? You didn’t mention anything about SMS confirmation before. Sounds like you are moving goal posts. 
 
Besides SMS confirmation isn’t foolproof either. There were some recent high profile hacks where hackers convinced the phone company they owned a phone number they actually didn’t have authorisation to use in order to steal bitcoin.
 
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:29:24
Yeah I agree; muppets who babble insufferably about HODLing just look like complete imbeciles.

I doubt Satoshi is even Japanese, but he's not that complete egotistical clown Craig Wright

Coinbase being insured doesn't stop them for taking your money if there's a civil forfeiture on your assets. Whereas if you own your private key, a civil forfeiture is a useless stack of papers.

I would love it if it would goto 6k, but I am pretty skeptical of that happening.
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:25:25
No it’s not. I fully agree with people who say “not your key, not your bitcoin”
 
And a unclean computer is not safe for anything including coinbase. You don’t think that keylogging malware won’t steal your bitcoin in coinbase when it detects you logging in? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:27:40
Not a ponzi. Ponzis are a form of investment fraud where payments from new investors are being used to pay returns to old investors.
 
Bitcoin isn’t a currency either. It is a volatile commodity and it doesn’t promise returns on anything like a shitty HYIP or ICO would. 
 
Not even Statist regulators are calling it a ponzi. But you are. Who are you again?
 
Also I’m not sure why you are so eager to show me proof you bought bitcoin in 2013. It really doesn’t matter to me.

So far all attempts by pornhub and cam sites to convince their users to use crypto have failed. The usage of crypto on porn is weak.
 
But crypto is doing well with gambling projects. It's possible that insurance products will be the next big thing in crypto and blockchain if and when crypto becomes more stable.
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:13:58
100% agree
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:48:24
That’s true. I would have to agree here.

My reading comprehension skills are fine and English is my second language. How many languages do you speak? Phone verification could mean a lot of things, it doesn’t necessarily mean sms verification.
You are really getting all worked up and pissy over this. Calm down and cool it with the insults. 
 
I’m not talking shit about coinbase; I actually said they are fantastic for converting fiat to bitcoin. 
 
And indeed I provided alternatives: a hardware wallet. If you can’t afford that then a paper wallet is better than storing in coinbase or ANY OTHER EXCHANGE.
You keep talking about poor people and how they won’t have a pc but coinbase works only in a few countries (it doesn’t work in my country so I use cubits instead) and you need either a credit card or a bank account to use it which is something unbanked poor people won’t have access to anyway. 
 
Also even if we weren’t talking about coinbase but instead were talking about cubits, my stance wouldn’t change: cubits is great for converting fiat to bitcoin but then you should immediately transfer to a hardware wallet when you complete that action.
If you are too poor to afford a hardware wallet but somehow have enough money to buy bitcoin then a paper wallet is the next best thing.

Nobody is perfect and bitcoin never peaked at 21k you dummy. Better than being underwater like most of the muppets that bought in December 2017. The hilarious part is they make themselves feel better by babbling about no coiners. Pathetic.

Problem with that is that TA is mostly bullshit unlike playing Poker with +EV. Also it's a zero sum game. For every winner you need a chump "hodling" the bag 
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:16:11
Don't be a pedant. This is a big deal, and using bitpay changes nothing. This is the government we're talking about, of course they will use a payment processor. So fucking what? You expect them to HODL? LOL
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:47:12
No need to get testy.
 
Email verification and phone verification is useless if you are on an malware infected machine. As soon as the malware detects that you are logged into coinbase for whatever reason and complete 2 factor authentication, it can hijack that session and empty out all of your coins.
  
What you are advocating is a false sense of security.
 
And what do I suggest people do? For starters get educated on basic computer security and don’t get your PC infested with malware in the first place and then invest in a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:58:23
Except that people who have emails on their phone also usually have the same email address on their pc and the malware can just look for that email in the user’s inbox and automatically confirm and delete the email.
Also it isn’t far fetched for someone to have malware spread to their phone since people tend to sync their phones with their pc and that is an attack vector for the malware to spread to their phone. 
And I remember what you said. I am saying what you say is “safer than alternatives” gives people a false sense of security.
 
What is a real safer alternative is a hardware wallet.
I have nothing against coinbase. It serves a useful purpose for being able to convert fiat to btc, but as soon as you complete that action you should move your coins to cold storage.

Don’t put words in my mouth tool. Enjoy your massive losses. And I do own coin btw. Bought some back in 2015 lol

I live in Hong Kong. I've both seen and used these ATMs. They're okay I guess, but I wish you could withdraw with them too instead of just deposit. 
 
Also aside from myself, I've never actually seen anyone use them.
