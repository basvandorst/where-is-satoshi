in world of warcaft you start at out 600 item level when u hit max level. 701 is the soft cap. there is alot of time to get from 600-700 and i offer services to cut that time in half or less. i farm guild to buy mythic runs with full loot and give to deserving noobs who offer 24 hours of time or something in exchange for saving htem months of time. also i give them free wow time instead of a 16 dollar a month subscription. also there are collectable mounts the list goes on of services i can offer

well to buy 100k gold from like a seller(which includes the markup for the seller) is 90 dollars. obviously thats ridiculous and they want to make money 100k is worth about 50 dollars id say. because currently to buy 1 month of wow time or "wow token" it is roughly 24k gold. that 24k is worth 16 real dollars if paid for a subscription if you count a penny saved is a penny earned. at that exchange rate 100k would be worth 75 dollars so in comparison i think 50-60$ for 100k is the price range

oh this is very true but if we can become environmentally friendly relatively easily why not strive for it? lets try to make cryptocurrency superior in every feasible way we can.

propaganda normally implies some type of falsehood or stretching the truth. this is a legitimate problem in the cryptocurrency industry and one that should be solved
