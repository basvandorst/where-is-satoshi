I remember thinking “damn, I guess this is it..too expensive for me now” lolololol. I’m glad i bought most of mine in 2015

There used to be a BBQ coin? ������ man, I wish I was around in 2010-2012. Btw, is your sentiment about alts also applicable to Eth and XRP? Utility wise, I feel they set themselves apart from BTC. Coins after the top 10 I don’t really care for.

Sold 2.4 bitcoins sept 2016 to pay for the tuition of a class that I ended up dropping out of 6 weeks later ����.....��...fuck me...����. I’m lucky the remaining coins I do have is enough to wipe out my student loans..if I decided to sell today (not likely). 
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:28:46
I needed to hear this right about now. ����
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:58:25
Man, I think about that everyday. Hodl, hodl, hodl, right? Ugh. Idk if I should sell now in case it falls to 5k. Stress, man.

Congrats to you! I hope to clear my student loans after this next bull run.
@_date: 2019-06-21 18:00:04
I forgot about this one!
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:52:34
Oh hell no. Lol. I was fairly oblivious to bitcoin while I was in school. I started investing when I got my first job right after graduation. All my regret over student loans will most likely be gone by 2020!
@_date: 2019-06-15 07:06:26
I’ve....never heard of that. You learn something new everyday on this subreddit ��
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:42:37
That’s what I’m hoping, but there’s still one thing I’ve been pondering. Would you consider prices stabilizing somewhat after this run up due to the pending financial crisis? I can imagine regular folks putting their money into this asset and not selling into inflated fiat. Idk. I’m just trying to prepare for the REAL 2024 life changing bull run.
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:55:43
$225. Beautiful times....if only I knew what it’d become. I would’ve bought like my life depended on it.
@_date: 2019-06-15 07:16:02
It’s gonna suck for those not holding crypto...
@_date: 2019-06-02 05:50:56
It sounds messed up, but I kinda relish in this scenario. comeuppance for an entire over-privileged generation, who pretty much played the next generation... I do feel for those who lived frugally though..
@_date: 2019-06-13 21:18:28
Makes you wonder what else will exist in the future that we won’t get to experience..
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:56:30
I expect to pay off my student loans next year!

That’s what I did in 2015. My chase savings account had closed right around the time I got my first job. I would save my money in coinbase. It was wild to watch my account grow noticeably larger week after week.
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:55:37
I just won’t talk about it. I was more than happy to explain a few months ago, when people didn’t want to listen, but I’m not gonna talk now. Oh well.
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:18:19
This is how it all started for me back in 2015. I thought, “wow! Why am I keeping my money in my chase savings account? I can just keep it in my Coinbase wallet and double my money every month!” I realize today how risky that was, but it worked out BEAUTIFULLY!!
@_date: 2019-06-02 05:54:07
I love this! Very true
@_date: 2019-06-02 05:43:16
$225. I miss those prices...
And no..I’m in XRP now. I’ll reinvest in bitcoin after the next bull run
@_date: 2019-06-15 07:03:32
Which is UTTERLY RIDICULOUS!!! I was just thinking about this today. So traders are kinda screwed. Let’s just throw the whole system away. How is this gonna be enforced for EVERYBODY anyways?

I thought of the same thing when I saw this box the other day.
@_date: 2019-04-03 00:23:03
It’s SOOOOOO NICEE to see green again. Here’s to hoping it won’t dump!!!
*please hold above 4500...����*
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:55:55
You got it wrong, man!!!!
@_date: 2019-05-31 14:28:50
I’d buy one! Reminds me of cuphead

Ledger nano S. It’s pretty user intuitive. However, I should mention that the last firmware update gave me some problems. It’s all good now.

I like this answer. Those who take risks will often be the ones to reap great rewards.
@_date: 2018-12-14 07:35:49
I’m finding everything I can sell rn for more crypto money!
@_date: 2019-05-17 01:03:08
I’ve been thinking about that so much lately. I HOPE investors flock to crypto during the next recession, but when people have immediate needs, won’t they pull out of ALL assets? Especially such a new one like crypto? Idk man..I just hope the bull run happens BEFORE the next recession.
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:33:24
From what I understand, this was an expected move based off of TA. A tightening wedge pattern with higher lows was bound to have a major break in one direction or another. Fortunately, it was a break to the upside.  
Sorry I don’t have a deeper explanation...

I’ve tried to get my car sold for SOOO LONG at 4,000. It’s still hasn’t, and now I gotta watch the price go higher and higher.....������
