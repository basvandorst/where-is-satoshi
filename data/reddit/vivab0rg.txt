What a horrific scenario: 120K bitcoins loose on the black/dark markets.
@_date: 2016-08-14 17:34:27
Thanks for the transparency. Mycelium is still the best wallet I've tried since my Android 2.2 days. Others don't come close feature-wise yet (and I did try them). Copay got some UX right, but for power users Mycelium is where it's at.
I do agree that the Mycelium UX has lots of room for improving, but being a developer myself, I do prefer the code refactoring first to make it future-proof.
Thanks again for a great wallet.
A loyal user.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:10:23
Is there an app for that?
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:37:16
Doesn't support SegWit yet.

As an Argentinian it's very hard to believe that's happening to an european country. Even when Argentina defaulted on 2001, electronic payments where not affected to this extent.
@_date: 2014-07-20 15:06:21
What about Mycelium default transaction fee? I've heard that they're higher than other wallets and not changable. Was that you experience too?

I went DigitalOcean because Linode does not accept PayPal. Whichever accepts Bitcoin first has a me as a customer!

I want "Transfer PayPal funds to Bitcoin wallet" option.

What about mycelium transaction fees? Are they user-configurable yet?

Thanks Andreas for an invaluable resource. I'm a developer from Argentina and have been devouring the Early Release edition almost since it was available. We surely need this kind of material down here!

Where do you exchange your Dogecoins for Bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-09-10 13:02:47
I'm in Argentina. Not quite but pretty much.

Care to elaborate? I found [this]( on the Coinbase help pages:


@_date: 2014-12-17 11:33:44
I'm from Argentina. USD currency controls have not loosened at all. But yeah, if you're willing to smuggle your USD fiat somehow, you can easily get +50%.
@_date: 2014-09-25 15:46:46
That's what I meant, but you cannot add funds to your Coinbase account using PayPal.
@_date: 2014-09-17 16:27:23
I can confirm. But it's still one of the few options to get some bitcoins fast with PayPal funds in Argentina.
@_date: 2014-07-25 17:19:10
I'm an argentinian and that is also my fear. Hopefully, presidential elections are coming next year and the polititians have their minds set elsewhere! But then again, this is *Argentina* we're talking about...

Just what I did, to bip-38 password-protected paperwallets, after verifying they could be spent be either Mycelium and Blockchain.info
I don't like depending on one single piece of software for my coins!
@_date: 2014-07-11 13:07:23
Not quite yet, but this definitely targets exchange houses and such. Mind you, how *exactly* this new control is supposed to work and is actually *implemented* in any way, is not specified in the new ruling at all.

Wonderful project. I've been a user since XBMC, using it everywhere (netbook, notebook, Mac mini). Now it's OpenELEC on my Raspberry Pi 2. It was due time for donating, very glad they accept Bitcoin now!

Thank you very much for sharing.

Great! Just please don't "loose" any of the features we already love!
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:58:25
No, shops adopting this measure are part of an association that ruled the "strike" against credit/debit cards, so at least since being part of that association they were most likely already accepting them.
@_date: 2016-03-23 14:23:43
Mycelium has long been my choice of Bitcoin wallet since the Android 2.2 days and multiple devices since, but it does need a serious UI revamp ASAP. Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2016-03-29 15:20:47
@_date: 2016-03-28 00:14:04
Like any of the advanced features, I'd hate to have the hidden or less accesible on a dumb-down UI.
