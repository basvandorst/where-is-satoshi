Oh you Anarchists, always thinking the popo are out to get you.
If the cops went through the trouble of getting a warrant to search Mt.Gox records, there is a very good reason. And that reason isn't to catch your buying a couple grams of weed on Silkroad.
If you feel the need to hide from the police, go ahead and use a tumbler. You're a sucker for paying the fees.

Ok, lets say the NSA was spying on your connection(Ignoring why **you** were selected out of millions of Americans).  
They find out you went to Mtgox.com, and likely have interest in Bitcoins.  
So what does that tell them about your spending habits, and how many coins you own? Jack shit.  
They would still need a warrant to get Mt.Gox logs, or find out your Withdraw address to trace your transactions.


Can you express yourself without using stupid memes?

Issuing a chargeback against your dealer is a great way to get shot.

Not an issue for people just trying to protect their privacy on the blockchain.  
The only people willing to pay the 1.5% are doing something illegal. (Not that I care)

I swear, the speculators will destroy bitcoin like they did with everything else.

Oh I know this game!  
Completely ignore my argument, then spout off barely related nonsense to change to topic, then dissect every sentence I type, taking the opposing side.  
Rinse and Repeat until I give up, and you get the satisfaction of winning an Internet Argument.  
Bravo, your e-peen grew 3 sizes this day.

Agreed.  
The community would have a collective shitfit if their servers got seized, and wallets were no longer accessible.

Wow, cool. TIL.

Oh you speculators....
