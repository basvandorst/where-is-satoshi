This is true innovation, the type of development we need to see happen. Shame on people using the blocksize issue as a distraction.

Fees solve blocksize issue.

Looking at the behavior and actions of Gavin Andresen aka Gavin Bell aka NSA plant, you do have a point.

Haha true. Gavin and the "Alliance" of rats.

As long as the price is responding positively, the number of nodes is irrelevant.

Losers will always whine and mock.

For some reason the worst dregs of the Internet have migrated to the bitcoin space and have sunk it's reputation. I think that is the main reason why people dislike bitcoin, the people around it are simply vile.

No we don't. Bitcoin is incompatible with the general public and frankly doesn't give a shit. In any system only 1% of the participants are doing anything useful.
@_date: 2015-10-18 15:56:26
No. How would they get bitcoin?

This just goes to show how bitcoin is powering innovation in the 'real' economy, not just the digital space.
Well done BitFury, well done. This type of investment could attraction tens of billions into bitcoin and take us where we need to go. The moon.

Buttcoiners are from sub $4 level. So many of them are so bitter and depressed from missing out on 250x gains they now do everything they can to talk down the price.
This is a pathetic group composed of life losers working 9-5 wage slaves.
