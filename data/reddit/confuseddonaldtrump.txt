Is the guy with the hat trowing dollar notes around because bitcoins are imaginary or because he was only interested in bitcoin as a means to get more dollars?

(a) There are no specific BCH ASICS  or BTC ASICS. ASICS mine both the coins based upon which one is most profitable at that moment. They just need to flip chain and everything else stays the same. The same ASIC might mine BCH one week and BTC the other week. And the hashrate of each chain follows the market price. 
(b)  So you believe that Roger and Jihan have more BTC then anybody else? How much BTC do you think they still have and when will they run out and how much BTC do they spend each day?
(c) Jihan also holds BTC, if he dumps BTC this would be the exact same thing. If Jihan wants BCH to succeed and BTC to die why does he not just stop mining on the BTC chain and sell all his BTC for BCH? 
You are believiing thing that are simply not true.

Bitcoin is digital  gold. People will buy it automatically. No reason to worry about adoption. It's not for everybody, only for a handful ellect and elite. The only use case is that it's better then fiat and gold because it cannot be inflated (even gold can be inflated) and you can send it more easy then gold. So when the world will see this, they will all buy it instead of gold and the price will go to over a million dollars. You will see it happen. It's bounded and destined to happen. Can not go wrong. Just sit and wait and
