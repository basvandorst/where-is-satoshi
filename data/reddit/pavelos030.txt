But just because they can doesn't mean they have to make use of their power. I think if you would ask the subscribers what they would prefer the majority of us would not agree to censorship.
Who are the moderators btw? Is it known?

It's more deflationary than any form of money humanity ever dealt with because:
- unlike anything else a increase in imput (through higher increase in effort to create more of it) doesn't lead to a increase in output
- the increase in demand will eventually be higher than the ever decreasing additional supply
-people keep loosing their btc though the loss of private keys due to sudden accidents such as unforeseeable death or other circumstances

Hey man,
actually it's even less than that. In circulation be have about 17.2 MM, then there is the one million of satoshi which hasn't been touched yet and probably won't be touched which makes it 16.2 MM and then we would have to deduct the funds of all those poor fellas who lost their keys. This number is estimated to be between 3-4 MM. Which brings us to an actual available supply if somewhere between 12.2 and 13.2 MM.
As a comparison: There are roughly three times more USD millionaires out there

That's the issue with spending bitcoin right there. If it continues the way it has so far for the last 9 years people will have a hard time to let their precious BTC go if they might as well hold on to it and get rich later.

This is a typical argument of bitcoin newbies. Please educate yourself.

The problem is that most non technical people don't get what peer to peer is supposed to mean

Trust me it is more useful to set your smart watch to show dogecoin is worth in doge.
Like this you can get constantly reminded that one doge will always be worth one doge.

Wooow!! This is fucking impressive. From now on I want everything to be explained to me like I am three years old. If the other person refuses, I will argue that he doesn't really understand what the fuck he is talking about because otherwise he could also be able to explain it in a easy way, right? RIGHT?!?!??

He said: "at least one BTC". Can be much more of cause.
Its the best advice you can get from a altcoin creator. Charlie Lee is so honest he just doesnt give a shit and is not ready to lie/shill in order to promote his own project.
