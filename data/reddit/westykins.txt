Just buy a few dude don't go all in.

I get that but I feel that small things like not requiring bank verification just to purchase coins shouldn't hinder my attempts to join.
Unless I'm severely misinterpreting something.

So one of my best options is a craigslist ish type of meeting?
:(

Just promise me you won't kill yourself if it goes to shit.
I'll buy you a meal if it does. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:16:50
Because I feel we shouldn't have to verify a bank in the first place, and I don't have a problem with putting a debit card down right away.

Knowing him and his personality, i'd believe it. For now, i will continue to love :)

82 cents! :o 
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:58:18
Yeah I see what you mean.
I just don't understand why bank accounts need to be approved to buy bitcoin? 
And yeah. Plenty of warnings, but it's still really sad, I think :/ 
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:02:34
Exactly man, I've been waiting for 6 days for the verification and watching the prices fluctuate is killing me. 
But yeah this system could be so much more simple and it would help new people get on board easier.
I have 82c worth of bitcoin man, I just wanna get more :p
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:31:59
Alright, that makes a little more sense.
Your condescending shit is really off putting, but thank you for explaining your reasoning. Take care. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:24:30
Why do you capitalize "fiat"? Honest question. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:35:51
Destiny uses bitcoin, Jesus I keep finding new ways to love you :) 
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:09:00
Uhm, the common fool? It's not hard to get in, it just takes fucking forever.
It's foolish to dive into shit that's new and isn't as guaranteed as you'd like.

How about a picture of a guy facing forward with a bitcoin in his right hand between his pointer and middle finger ( kind of like a ninja  star) and an American flag in his left hand)
(Think epic video game cover status)
It's gives off the notion that this is the bitcoin revolution, and what not. :3 
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:38:05
I get that. I'm sorry for coming off like that, I guess I'm tired of sitting on 82 cents of bitcoin for so long, that I'm taking it out on people.  
I'll read more up on it and try some other methods. Thanks again. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:55:39
Haha I've been lurking for a few months and I have to admit, the "hang on tight, chums!" Is pretty funny :) 
@_date: 2013-11-26 11:16:40
Can I submit an application? :'( 
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:46:15
I've got about 80ish cents that's gonna be worth 80ish dollars someday :)
