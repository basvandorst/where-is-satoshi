The more we use it, the more unuseable it will be. With the current technology the mempool will be "full" again and we have fees of 20$.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:54:29
Dude I'm not advocating for altcash. I'm just saying that exchanges like shapeshift are already using segwit and coinbase users are STILL not moving to shapeshift in a large amount.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:57:35
Exchanges like Shapeshift and some others are already using segwit. Everyone thinks that if LN is gonna be deployed by a site, users will migrate to it. They won't unfortunately. "Normal" coinbase users are not interested in the technology behind it, they are in it for the quick buck. And they can do it on coinbase with high or low fees, they don't care. Also the most amount of new people coming into bitcoin are buying it through coinbase, not any other exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:10:57
To be honest I'd love me some 3k coins :D
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:12:42
Luckily I emptied that card when they supported S2X. What a shit hole 
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:12:57
Sounds too good to be true.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:20:49
Dude, noone is gonna use it... There are already companies who use segwit, but noone uses them...
E: I'm just saying that exchanges like shapeshift are already using segwit and coinbase users are STILL not moving to shapeshift in a large amount.

Thank him for me.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:44:17
The mempool is NOT low. 1 week ago it was low. Now it's fucking full. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:14:08
If we go down to 3k again, I'm still happy.
@_date: 2018-05-28 10:16:57
The BCH sub's name is literally . So I don't see why they would stop there...
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:30:54
You know the BCH fork was planned before it actually forked, right? Are you okay, dawg?
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:15:31
Did I say that they were always BCH shills?
Now slow and steady so you can understand it: r/btc was a Bitcoin sub that turned bcash sub when the idea was introduced
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:51:19
I know. But even before the fork they were BCH shills
@_date: 2019-11-25 06:58:30
I kinda wished I had bought some at 0.10 $ and sold at 19k...
@_date: 2019-11-25 07:01:02
Even on coin base they are saying that 74% are buying and 26% are selling. I for one welcome the black Friday week sale.
@_date: 2018-10-06 13:25:55
I mean you could still EMP the whole world to throw us back into the stoneage. That will slow it down for sure
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:27:37
How can they take my money if I hodl? I'm not selling, duck that shot. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:32:34
Well some may say I also had some mbtc in nucleus market (not $1 to 1 coin times haha, about 400€/btc) and bought from a scammer. and then the whole site exit scammed haHAA
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:29:00
God wants you to HODL. he will give it back to you when it's at 10k/btc
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:27:10
Some may say I bought a lot of bitcoin when it was 400. Some may also say that I wasted it all on drugs...
@_date: 2019-11-22 09:45:45
I'm just putting in 50 euros every 2-3 weeks now. I'm also waiting on the black friday sale to go in with more.
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:28:47
No, the FUDmind is real with this one. I expect it to be around $100
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:50:41
They still did something good, so good on them.
@_date: 2017-08-03 08:00:46
Sorry, but if you are retarded enough to directly transfer btc to the darknet without using a, Sry if my terminology is wrong here, coinsplitter service you deserve to get busted.
In the end it would have just been negative press for bitcoin.de and bitcoin itself if they hadn't cooperated. Still not demanding a court order is questionable. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:52:08
Shoosh. That's hard. Sorry for all the unfortune events happening to you. Maybe the package will arrive in the furture^^
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:23:12
So again, in your opinion they shouldn't have done it?
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:23:17
Don't listen to this man! Sell them to me!
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:18:21
Well my opinion is that you can't trust anyone. If you are trading in an "official" open marketplace, please don't think your rights mean anything to anyone. Maybe we should be glad that they gave the information away to the police and not sold them to the highest bidder, which they probably still did/do.
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:35:55
Meanwhile here in Europe we are waiting for the 3000€ :P
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:31:34
Doesn't make up for it. Never said that. But still a good thing. Would you find it better if they kept the BTC? So it fits your world view?
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:42:01
How'd you mean lose? They are burned up or something. Because if they still exist somewhere, you will find them surely. Maybe in 10 years when you can sell for 10k/btc ;)
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:54:29
He asked how he could protect his btc and dump his shitcoin. I don't think he will get better answers in aka .
They would probably tell him how to do the opposite.
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:08:52
And the graph on the right is even for 7 days. So it was a good week, too!

General question, but why should miners mine when they don't get a reward?

It only proves that there are still people here who have a brain and read the comments. But the post is still upvoted to the Frontpage

I'm not playing. I am just buying and HODL'ing. That's exactly the reason why.

You're right, but what about the Karma I could get?
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:26:26
Yes. Also it will work with all other wallets. Your seed is just another form of your private key. So don't share and triple offline backup Dat shit. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:50:53
Idk man, if you set your fee too low than it is unlikely the tx will go through, because of the mempool spam.

I don't think we will get to $5k this fast again. But surely it will rise back up at a stable $4.2k-$4.6k. Screencap this and laugh at me when it rose to $6k by the end of september.

Why is it allowed to mine empty blocks? I thought I was well informed about Bitcoin and blockchain technology. But this, I can't wrap my head around it.

Because you probably don't look inside the kitchen the first time you visit there. And I NEVER want to eat something like this. Your scenario would be 100% reactionary, you can only know that place X stinks because you have been there. With regulations and permits/licenses you at least have inspections, etc. So I know that it is likely, when I go to place Y and Y gets regular inspections, that place Y does not stink. In this scenario we are operating somewhat preemptively.
