Damn.  Looks like I'll have to go the old fashioned route with localbitcoins.com then.

Ugh.  Damn.  The only reason I recently switched to US Bank a few weeks ago is because they support Samsung Pay and that's my college's banking service.

Oh, yeah now I remember.  Forgot all about that shit sub that broke off.

Not sure if there's a way to see when confirmations went through, but last time I checked before this it had been stuck at one forever.
But of course as soon as you call me out on it, I check and it's at 3.
Next transaction I make can you ask me for proof again so it speeds up?

what subreddit?

The same time the mempool is completely backed up...

It's an awesome idea, but man that sounds difficult to pull off.
If you did though, I would fucking use the hell out of it.

Sigh.... 4 hours at high priority, one confirmation.

I didn't deposit any, a while back I was going to use it to buy BTC.  However, after my first attempt at buying them, they asked me for ID verification.

Pay the fee? Last transaction of mine was on high priority about 5 hours ago.  
@_date: 2016-12-02 03:18:57
Circle permabanned me for no reason after I submitted my verification.
I don't like them.

OP is Larping.  Story is obviously BS
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:11:47
Yeah, seriously.  Anyone that's an early adopter to Bitcoin would at least know how to hook up the laptop to a monitor through VGA, HDMI, mDP etc....the screen being broken is completely irrelevant. OP is a BSer. 
 After BTC was in the news so much a year and a half ago when it hit 20k, he would've almost certainly remembered about it then.

You literally just have to google "how to get files off broken laptop".  Hell, my friends 60 year old parents that are nearly technically illiterate managed to replace the dead hard drive in an old MacBook pro, they just googled it and did it. Why would the first thing OP does is post this here asking for technical support? And he knows he doesn't need the password to his laptop, yet, he knows that someone can access his wallet but he doesn't trust them? The story just doesn't make much sense.

Spectrum is significantly better than Comcast, and better than TWC. (At least in Kansas City; then again every ISP is better here since we were the first to have Google Fiber as competition)

Time Warner is different than Time Warner Cable.
