It's the other way around my OG...  How many time have we read or heard about "If anything goes wrong on LN, the main chain will act as a fail safe"?
Well, in that case, Lightning is IP, and the blockchain is TCP, no?

Are you describing Bitcoin Cash + LN?

They will first implement single channels, then a centralised version of multihop payments, then full Ligthning Network, it will be progressive.

Until there is at least 1 confirmation on the blockchain, he can invalidate the transaction with the RBF feature of Bitcoin BTC (Replace by fee). These days, with the confirmation delays, RBF is much easier to pull off.
tl;dr - Do not let go of your laptop until the transaction gets confirmed at least 1 time.

Bitcoin is not a currency at this point, it is a secure hard asset, like gold, even better than gold, as it is secured by the network. It provides you with sovereignty over your life savings.

BTC= Store of Value + high fees; Means of Exchange (Lightning Network) + Low fees  
BCH= Store of Value + Means of Exchange + low fees

It could also be overnight borrowing, for all we know.

They would not have to accept Lightning. The fees will grow on- chain to such levels that preserve their profitability.
Currently the fees + rewards are about $190,000 per block, for 2,000 transaction, so as time goes by, all things being equal, we should see normal fees inching towards $95-100 per transaction. Quite cheap to preserve your sovereignty over your life savings.
