Yeah, just mention how the price is 'gonna moon' once you're done ;)

I was being /s but in reality, I imagine you will need to take a simple point and drive it home.  I figure that everyone will just want to know if it solves the fee and lag problem and when.

Well, let's hope that he's factored in paying his taxes on any profits because the arrangement might not seem as appealing.

Yep - get them to pay you in Bitcoin, though.

There are developers?

Decentralized currencies are here to stay.  These schoolyard fights over "who's the real Bitcoin" will make it easy for better technologies to take over, though.

Welcome to the wild, wild west pardner.

I respect what you are saying, however this also needs to be balanced with the real world events.  If a production system is under threat, the system needs to be secured as a priority.  There has to be a trade-off between urgency and prudence - after all, if something is impacting the network it is simply not responsible if it isn't fixed, especially if you have had sufficient time to see it coming.
While I don't doubt that the development team are doing their best, it seems that capacity planning has been left out of the equation. 
 Sure it's being worked on, but there is a responsibility to make the current live network *at all times* be worthy of a "replacement to fiat currency" - not just when v2.0 comes out.  
It seems that someone who understands things at a higher, business-level needs to coordinate a release based on the immediate issues that are faced.  This should factor in non-technical aspects such as how long you can wait before poor media coverage, loss of confidence (etc) causes capital flight, brand damage and payment alliances to be dropped.  Once the project team understands this timeline, 
this should mesh with a release schedule that at least alleviates the highest priority problems until the next release cycle.  Right now, it fully appears that the plan is to hop onto Reddit, tell people to HODL and just down-vote and ban the dissenters.  It doesn't instill a lot of faith.
Again, please be reminded that I am not trying to attack or undermine you or the project team (I wish people could assume this, but in the current heated atmosphere this is unlikely).  Some people might be here to destroy, but don't forget that that there are others that are here to help build.

This is like a nerd version of Game of Thrones.  I just can't wait for this season's finale.  
Roger Ver leads his dragons to breathe fire on the golden Bitorb.
"It's mine, all miiine(rs)!" he squeals in perverse pleasure.
He takes the glowing orb in his bare hands and squeezes.  The life-blood drips down his arms.  Possessed, he places his lips to the orb and drinks.  His eyes glaze over with power.  The orb's deep glow fades.  The world of Consensus feels a deep mourning come over it.
Yet, what is that yonder?  A mighty Lightning strike hits the around.  A darkened silhouette appears surrounded by 100 bearded men.
"Who goes there?" it thunders.  "I am Core.  You shall not pass!"
Core casts a perma-ban bolt at Roger.  The bolt hits him with impunity.  Roger guffaws as he gestures to his lead dragon.
"Catch me if you can, Core.  I'll be at The Flippening".
(To be continued.. in 18 months  ;)

Bitcoin was always meant to be a *decentralized currency* - not just a store of value.  The [white paper]( is clearly entitled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System".  
I don't like that many seem to be defending the situation we currently have.  I'm not here to attack the system, but we really do need to highlight that we have an urgent issue with fees that are hindering adoption.  If this doesn't hit home to you, perhaps consider that people who are using Bitcoin for pure speculation will exit the market for other more promising alternatives.  In this case, your "store of value" will decline or stagnate potentially for years (much like we saw from 2013-4 until now).  At that stage it will be too late to ask the hard questions and regain traction in the market.  Let's do the hard questions now.

I feel that this is what is giving BTC its value at the moment - people protecting their wealth.  This is a great application but not the only one.  I don't think we should lose the vision that BTC could be much greater.  Not for buying coffees but for making transacting accessible again to all those who have been shut out of the system and also for building economies that can be totally autonomous.  The applications are endless and it all comes down to the basic function of ensuring people can transact fluidly.

The problem I have with protonmail is - how long will it be around for?  I have previously used alternate email providers only to have them go offline and take all my mail with it.  It's a matter of assessing which are the highest risks for what you are using your email for (eg. classified details=protonmail+encrypted backups, casual conversations=gmail).
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:36:01
Thanks, I understand a bit better now.  I assume there are tools out there that can brute-force an Electrum wallet?  I thought it was prohibitive to do a brute-force on wallets?  How long does a single iteration take?
**EDIT**: Actually, I don't understand.  A brute force would require all combinations from say 8 to 30+ characters to brute force it.  There must have been some sort of pre-knowledge of how long the password is if you're going to try brute-forcing specifically a 30-character password.
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:51:03
Thanks for the info.  I'm still confused that it could be so easy to brute-force a 30 character passphrase.  Something is missing from my understanding of the situation.
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:32:07
I don't understand your focus on the "memorized" aspect of this.  Are you trying to say the phrase was not random and guessable? If it was guessable, in what way? Was it a commonly used phrase that would be susceptible to dictionary attack? 
@_date: 2017-10-29 07:48:50
Given the vagueness of OPs replies, I'm starting to doubt the whole story.  "Cross scripting attack" (not even a Google search for this yields anything), "Move coins onto Mega for the fork" (Huh?), "30 character password that was weak", URL cross-links that don't mention the issue he mentioned ("Sorry, I can't find it now").  Every statement raises a whole lot of questions and none of it makes any sense really.  
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:31:30
Can you please explain a bit more? You had an Electrum wallet in a passworded tar.gz? Did the wallet AND zip both have a password? If so, was it the same password? Was it the same password you used for Mega? I don't understand how you think they guessed your password - brute force, previously compromised password or dictionary attack?
 
The whole thing doesn't seem trivial: 1) Someone who hacked your account knew about Bitcoin  2) They had some tools readily available to hack your Electrum wallet (?)  3) Your password was "guessable" even though it was 30 characters.  There's a major weak-point that isn't clear to me.
