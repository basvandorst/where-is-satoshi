Why not have an official increase now?  Wouldn't that immediately resolve the mempool issue?
What would be the drawback of increasing it right now, at least temporarily?

It seems to me like Brian Armstrong is actually more principled about his views of what Bitcoin is, and he is losing tons of customers for it.
He is LOSING money by not bowing down to every decision Core/Blockstream make about Bitcoin.  I think this is the opposite of being greedy.
He clearly has huge objections to how expensive and slow transactions with bitcoin have become as a result of refusing to increase the block size to even 2mb.
The reason Coinbase has such a huge effect on the mempool is because Coinbase is one of (if not the biggest) BTC/USD trading exchanges in the world....not only because they haven't adopted SegWit.

I miss the days when most bitcoiners were libertarians who actually understood free markets and monetary policy...I feel like most of the original adopters (mostly libertarians/anarcho-capitalists) jumped ship and went over to bitcoin cash

It is my native language, but in the context of the post I was replying to, the author alluded to the point that segwit was a blocksize increase, but not an official increase (i.e. "I believe, eventually, we will have an official increase as well").  This context led me to believe that the author did not consider the segwit to be considered an "official" block size increase.  I apologize for any confusion I may have caused by characterizing it as such.  I should have phrased it differently, and I will regret that mistake for the rest of my life.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:01:44
True that, I would have liked if they gave a specific date rather than just springing it in.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:39:30
Yeah, allowing customers more options is terrible.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:41:12
Coinbase said they were adding Bitcoin Cash more than a month ago.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:22:44
Yeah. I've been really surprised with how bad all of the other exchanges' UIs are.  I hope more exchanges clean up their look and user-friendliness.  That would do wonders for the whole space forsure.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:58:07
1. They also disabled the BUY button and explained why in their release blog - "Buys and sells will be available to all customers once there is sufficient liquidity on GDAX. We anticipate that this will take a few hours."
2. The price also increased a substantial amount (~80%) the previous 7 days
3. Coinbase is one of the only exchanges that credited people AT ALL for the Bitcoin held at the time of the fork.  Most people that didn't hold their BTC in their personal wallets will not receive ANY BCH from their exchanges.
4. There was PLENTY of warning.  If you read any of their blogs over the past couple of months, you would know that.  They explicitly even said that they were trying to add Bitcoin Cash before the end of 2017.
5.  How dumb of them as a company to offer its patrons more options to buy AND SELL more crypto-currencies.  How dumb of them to add the coin with the 3rd highest market cap in the space.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:37:55
Yeah, same.  This seems intentionally inflammatory and over the top to try to create division.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:56:21
I wish they would have announced a specific date a few days or a week ago

Is everything on this sub only going to be appeals to authority and hating on Roger Ver?  There are early adopters of Bitcoin that believe that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.  Why is a post complaining about Twitter not banning someone you don't like on the front page of this subreddit?  This sub is almost exclusively bashing bcash and memes about the price now.  What a joke.
@_date: 2019-02-07 15:42:07
I doubt it, but I'm willing to hear out the proposition.  Could you guide me toward any evidence that Roger Ver is the owner of the account?
@_date: 2019-02-20 20:42:49
I posted a thread talking about Nano and IOTA in the sub, what the pros and cons of each were compared to bitcoin and bitcoin cash....and I didn't get banned.  There was good conversation about bitcoin's weaknesses and strengths compared to NANO and IOTA's weaknesses and strengths.  In fact, Roger himself dropped in and commented that it was a good thread and no one should be concerned with being censored there.
@_date: 2019-02-20 22:17:42
Roger that.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:04:20
I know this is a loaded question, but can you give me an ELI5 explanation of how bigger blocks attempt to solve the scaling problem and how side chains attempt to solve it?
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:27:45
I see.  Why not use a combination of both?  Is that an option people are considering?  Maybe increase the block size for a while (to deal with current wait times and fees) and then implement the side chain technologies later on when they are ready?
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:42:09
I think Bitcoin Cash is a fitting name for it, given that it is the current version of bitcoin that can best be used as a medium of exchange.  Bitcoin is currently an inferior coin as it relates to being used as money (higher fees, longer transaction times).  However, if Lightning, SegWit, and other things come along that enhance Bitcoin back to low fees and fast confirmations, then Bitcoin Cash will die off (as it will be unnecessary).
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:38:15
Yeah, I've looked into Ethereum a little bit as well.  TThanks for the help my man.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:27:15
Ya, I’m trying to get feedback from both sides so that my opinion is well-rounded about which coin to invest more of my dollars into. Right now I’m basically 50/50 Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. I think I’m going to ask people in the other sub a similar question to see what their perspectives are as well.
@_date: 2019-02-07 19:24:37
It is not obvious to me.
@_date: 2019-02-07 09:09:50
According to the twitter account itself, it is owned by someone who is a longtime bitcoiner that happened to side with Bitcoin Cash when it forked into two different chains (Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash). Many people allege that the account was purchased by Roger Ver and that he is using it covertly, but I haven’t seen any evidence to suggest that that is true. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 23:08:30
If you are holding onto it, you are not "using" it.  If bitcoin cannot be used to conduct secure, cheap, fast transactions....then it will become less valuable than its competitors (both crypto and fiat alike).
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:33:29
ahhhh I see....hence bitcoin cash.  Thanks for the explanation my man.  Much appreesh
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:56:06
I disagree with your assessment
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:49:48
is that a better place to discuss bitcoin specifically?
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:53:26
People who support bitcoin cash truly believe it is the real bitcoin.  I don't think they are trying to scam people.  They believe the Bitcoin laid out in the Satoshi Whitepaper more closely resembles what Bitcoin Cash is today, and that Bitcoin itself has strayed too far away from the original intent.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:03:56
Thankfully he can swap them very quickly for almost no fee, maybe a couple cents.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:44:06
or he just changed his mind
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:53:56
I think Bitcoin Cash more closely resembles the original bitcoin, but calling it 'Bitcoin (BCH)' while using 'Bitcoin CORE (BTC) is misleading.  Just use the full names for both, and let people decide which coin they want to use based on the merits. This whole name-game thing is stupid.
@_date: 2019-05-21 16:19:04
I like Peter Schiff.
