You could sell the private key but you can never prove that you didn't keep a copy of it. In that sense they are not really transferable. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:08:48
Sounds like it's time to sell ;)
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:33:50
But more, don't take it out
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:08:47
Haha yes. Sell. ;)

You want .8 BTC in 12 months. At 1000 a month that's a maximum AVERAGE buy price of 15,000. If we simply assume linear growth, that means, from the current price, the price of one BTC may rise to 21,000 at the end of 2018 and you will have made your goal of one BTC by 2019. (You will also have made an extra $4,800 from your purchases alone) 
An exponential curve to the same date/price point would benefit you further so this estimate should be enough to conclude that if Bitcoin stays under 21,000 with any semi-consistant trend month to month, you will easily make your goal.

 If people won't hold during a lull/drop they'll sell to someone who will. So maybe it's more of a correction to who is holding, not a correction to the price.

You could put the public key for a donation to something. Or the Genesis address.

Use gdax, still coinbase but with minimal to no fees depending on how you use it.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:28:55
It'd be Nice tho
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:14:00
It means you got it wrong, try again.

That's not how math works.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:58:28
Not over 9000 lol
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:10:08
Yes, like hodling ;)

That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.
