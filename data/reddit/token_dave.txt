Your last point makes more sense than the first.  If I have a venmo account linked to my bank account, with or without a balance in it, how do I get the money to a merchant if I want to make a purchase?  Venmo /= dollars.  Venmo is venmo.

In a way they are, because part of the attractiveness of this BIP is that it allows easy one-off address exchanges, and infinite addresses can be generated to send multiple payments.  LN already enables this one-off address exchange, with the added benefit of zero-fee payments.

Meh.  What does Armstrong care if he goes long on BCH then uses his influence to cause the 'flippening' to happen?  It will shake things up, but won't mean the end, and he can make much greater gains doing that than promoting bitcoin.

This document shows his previous company received 9.6 Million in R&amp;D incentives and 3.1 Million in tax refunds, on the pretense that he spent his own bitcoin on R&amp;D.  I saw the $45 Million figure thrown around somewhere, but I can't seem to find proof of that.  
On page 9 of the above document, you'll see that Wright claimed that he used his personal bitcoin to buy $30 Million in software, assigned that software to a trust, then his company bought the software from that trust.  This made his company eligible for the tax credits.  I'm going to go ahead and assert that neither the software or bitcoin ever existed, and Wright thought he could use this con to fraudulently receive the tax credits without ever actually spending a dime on R&amp;D.  His motive in leaking documents that expose himself as satoshi would be to get the ATO to believe that he actually owned a significant sum of bitcoin, and had good reason not to disclose the specifics of those (non-existent) software purchases.  
This document shows the ATO's skepticism about the bitcoin investment:

It's much more likely that he's trying to convince the ATO that he *DOES* own the bitcoin.

That's not true.  Far from it.  This would only be true if mining a full block meant a 50% chance of your block being orphaned. The chance of this happening is small, but substantial enough such that mining empty blocks is usually rational, but only as long as transaction fees are less than the expected loss per block found given X orphan rate.  For example, if you expect to lose 1 out of every 100 full blocks you mine due to increased propagation time, then you'd need to earn 1/100th of 25 bitcoins in fees (0.25 btc) per block to make up for it.
@_date: 2015-12-03 14:19:31
I'd imagine there is an exact amount of bitcoin that a miner would have to earn from fees in order to make it rational to include transactions.  Any idea what this is?  I think the only piece of data that would need to be known to figure this out is propagation time per byte of block size.

Short term, maybe.  Long term, I think you'll have to give some good reasons as to why you think this is the case.  Currently, if I "buy bitcoin" with coinbase, then use their shift card at a merchant, zero bitcoin transactions have taken place.  zero.  What's worse is that both circle and coinbase are pushing users to hold USD wallets rather than bitcoin wallets.  It's basically an exact clone of the existing system with price fluctuations that mirror the price of bitcoin, sometimes, if you choose not to use their "USD wallets".  It's quite literally the same as paypal, with the bonus of being able to withdraw bitcoin.  Sometimes.  As long as it's under $300 per week (Circle) and you don't use it for anything the government doesn't approve of.  The thing is, way more people already use paypal, so I can't see the incentive for average people to adopt bitcoin via coinbase, circle, etc.  I'm sorry, but these companies are no longer bitcoin companies for all intents and purposes, and need to be called out for what they are - opportunistic leeches who are using the bitcoin community to bootstrap something *very* un-bitcoin, driven not by ideology but by opportunism.

It probably never happened, but he probably claimed it did to get $45 Million from the Australian Government.  I wouldn't be surprised if he did use the money he got from the government to actually buy some of the infrastructure he claimed to have bought in the first place.  But this is likely the scam that that ATO suspects him of, hence the raid.  Once the ATO caught on, he knew his only way out was to claim he was Satoshi.  Hence the weird line in the "tulip trust" document directed at an ATO official which can be summed up as "see, told ya so!".  But the document proves nothing about whether he actually possessed the said bitcoin.

Small trustless bitcoin payments are direly needed in markets with large amounts of government control.  The prostitution, gambling, and marijuana industries come to mind.  Right now, the primary reason why prostitutes are still able to escape from pimps and find their own work is because they're able to make *peer to peer* bitcoin payments to backpage.com, while all third party payment methods have buckled to government pressure.  Just as governments can hold a gun to the heads of Visa and Mastercard, they can hold a gun to the heads of BitPay and Coinbase.  Without a doubt, one of bitcoin's killer apps is in censorship-resistant payments for fringe goods and services.  Relegating small bitcoin payments to centralized third party off-chain payment services completely destroys this vital use case.

We do know many things for certain, such as why the ATO was interested in him, how much in tax credits his company received from the Australian government, and that he claimed to spend millions worth of his personal bitcoin on software, which he 'donated' to his trust, which was then 'sold' to his company.  He may have figured that since there would be a paper trail of his company paying his trust for the 'software', this would be sufficient evidence to scam the AU government out of that tax money.  And it worked, until people starting asking questions at the ATO.

Because it's difficult to monetize when you don't have access to people's money.  These apps rarely acquire VC funding, and the one that did (blockchain.info) got too comfortable and stopped innovating, allowing the more user-friendly bitcoin banks to take over.  Add that to the fact that allowing new users to buy bitcoin with fiat is essential but highly regulated, and it makes creating a non-custodial killer app quite a difficult feat.

Unlikely.  They probably want him for acquiring $45 Million in tax credits under false pretenses by claiming he spent $100 Million in bitcoin buying infrastructure from third party vendors for R&amp;D purposes.  At very least, we know he claimed this and received millions from the Australian government.  The purpose of him fabricating the documents and leaking them would be to create plausibility that he did actually have a large amount of bitcoin to spend on R&amp;D, which he thought would appease the ATO.  In the terms of the 'tulip trust', it stated that he would be able to take out a loan from the 1.1 Million bitcoin 'held' by the trust... to spend on R&amp;D.  Very convenient.  He also made sure to name an official at the ATO in the document, which would ensure that the document would get their attention.  Also very convenient.

I accept Canadian credit cards frequently via PayPal.  I did the math once, and found that it's actually cheaper to run the cards as USD transactions for the USD equivalent because PayPal robs you on the conversion rate if you accept them as CAD.  So now, before I run the card, I do the conversion to USD manually and run them for that amount.  Doing it this way lets you charge the card using the proper conversion rate (probably dictated by the card company) rather than PayPal's.

Lightning network was an evolution of the payment channel concept.  The first type of payment channels were proposed by Jeremy Spilman in 2011-ish on the bitcoin mailing list, and was implemented in bitcoinJ shortly thereafter.  These channels were uni-directional and were strictly between two parties.  There were many 'problems' that this innovation was trying to address, but yes, among them were the facts that open blockchains like bitcoin are slow, expensive, and don't scale well.   The idea for LN came about when people realized that you could connect bi-directional payment channel participants together, and create a network where anyone can pay anyone without a direct channel.
I don't understand what you mean by LN presenting itself as a "solution" vs. being a "work-around".   Also, I don't know what you mean by a 'codified middle man'.  There is still no middle man in these transactions.

Yes, you are missing the big picture.  If we want to eventually live in a world where bitcoin actually disrupts any significant part of the economic status quo, solutions that make it easier to use "bitcoin" via the Visa network are like a hit of heroin.  Feels good in the short term, but will kill you in the long run.  These services are also one step away from dropping the whole bitcoin thing and just becoming another PayPal.  See:  Circle.  If a user holds a balance at circle or coinbase, then sends a payment via a shift card, **no actual bitcoin are ever transacted**.  There are, however 1 or possibly 2 transactions on the Visa network, as well as 2 ACH transfers.  I don't know about you, but that doesn't look anything like the disruptive new technology that compelled me to dedicate my professional life to bitcoin.

Thanks for the feedback.
The use case that we're going for is a bit different than copay, in that the primary role of multi-sig is in assigning one of the user's keys to a fraud prevention oracle service, rather than having each keys held by a different human.  By default, it will be allocated to our service, but the user will have the ability to create a wallet where one of the keys will be assigned to a different third party fraud prevention service such as cryptocorp.   
I share your opinion on the ux.  We have most of the design elements completed, and are just cracking into the front end dev and back end simultaneously.  I usually like to have at least a mock-up of the front end before any back-end development takes place as well, because I find that this is able to clarify the essential functionality that will be needed.

There are business models which inherently avoid compliance, but unfortunately cannot provide the convenience that centralized, compliant bank-style models currently provide - specifically the ability to easily exchange between bitcoin and government currency.  It's a give-and-take.  Once a company becomes compliant, however, they have compromised on the central tenant that bitcoin was created to avoid in the first place (reliance on trusted third parties).

Use  or  which allow you to easily store and access your own bitcoin without the need to trust a third party with your money.

Ok, price it in gallons of milk you can buy with the transaction fees.  We can't on one hand praise bitcoin for being deflationary, but at the same time ignore the fact that it costs more per unit. If the USD value of bitcoin had gone down 50% in the past year, you'd probably be praising the low transaction fees even if they had gone up in terms of satoshis.

I am doing this exact thing.  Having a compliant business model is a *choice* that coinbase made.  Blockchain.info made the opposite choice, and they're doing fine while remaining unregulated.

I can't believe people keep a straight face when saying things like "you always have the option to not use them" to justify the necessity of bitcoin banks.  You can literally say the same the same about fiat banks.  The only difference is the speed at which you can make peer-to-peer payments outside the system (paper vs bitcoin).    
@_date: 2014-10-14 17:59:16
Not to mention that consumers are unknowingly paying for the cost of the BTC / USD conversion by coinbase, since the USD/BTC exchange rate they're quoted at the point-of-sale is lower than the rate that coinbase actually sells their coins for to pay the merchant in fiat (and keep a cut).  Coinbase's profit from the exchange comes directly from the customer.  This is basically the same as a credit card company passing their processing fee on to the customer.

sellers on mycelium and local bitcoins technically need to be compliant with anti-money laundering laws.  They've already arrested a few to make examples of them.

Currently, coinbase requires that all the coins you purchase must be put in your coinbase wallet when you buy them.  Same with circle.  Why can't there be an open market for this activity?

You should, and Satoshi's holdings will be an albatross around Bitcoin's neck as far as it's potential adoption / market cap is concerned as long as the fate of those coins is unknown.  Satoshi likely hopes that some day he will be able to spend them anonymously or after revealing himself without having to convert them to fiat, but he's simultaneously making it more likely that we will never reach that day.  It's a catch-22.

I doubt Satoshi would be fond of this ecosystem being overrun by trusted third parties.  He was even iffy about the entire concept of web wallets like blockchain, where you still held your private keys.  At best he might see bitcoin banks as necessary evils towards a greater ends of more adoption.. which then leads to the trouble of these trusted third parties having a stranglehold on the rest of the bitcoin economy, reducing bitcoin to a fancy, volitile paypal / JP morgan hybrid.

No, because if each address above 1000 BTC represents a minimum of 1/13,000th of the entire money supply (1000 BTC / 13 Million BTC).  We can therefore know know that the maximum number of addresses holding &gt;1000 BTC is capped at 13,000.  So at the current distribution, we can know that 50% of the bitcoin supply cannot not be represented by more than 13,000 addresses.

it will probably store your 12-word mnemonic.  I agree, greenaddrss is a bit cumbersome.  It would be nice if everyone was able to store one of their keys in a multisig locally and properly back it up with a 12 word mnemonic, but it's just not streamlined enough to scale - not when coinbase just asks for a username and password.

It's because the bitcoin banks want to eventually hold fractional reserves and become actual 'banks'.  That's how banks profit - they invest and lend their reserves.  This is why they're raising ridiculous amounts of VC money.  The community needs to wake up, and we need to start calling out Coinbase, Circle, Xapo, et. al as dangerous places to hold your coins, and at best "necessary evils".  They're banking on the fact that once bitcoin reaches mainstream adoption, people won't care if they hold fractional reserves.  We (early adopters) should be speaking out to nip this in the bud.

This is quite a claim.  Care to elaborate?  From what I know, bitcoin is scarce, fungible, and easily divisible and transportable.  Does that not coincide with "traditional libertarian monetary theory"? 
I'll correct your statement:  Bitcoin may not coincide with one theorem in one school of libertarian economic thought, namely mises' regression theorem.  This theorem itself has been highly debated among Austrian economists, and completely rejected by the chicago school.  It is also highly debated as to whether or not bitcoin even goes against the regression theorem at all.

You could say the same of US Dollars.  You have the OPTION to hold cash if you want to, and make peer to peer transactions in dollars.  **The mere *OPTION* to transact in a peer-to-peer fashion is NOT the goddamn point.**  We should be promoting the *actual* use of peer-to-peer transactions at every turn, and denouncing all attempts at centralization.  
And there is also now nothing legally stopping coinbase and circle from holding fractional reserves, aside from the backlash they would face from the libertarian remnant that luckily still remains in the community.  But once more people like you flood the bitcoin community, they can and likely will start to hold fractional reserves.  
People who hold your nonchalant sentiment toward centralization are a cancer that could prove to cause irreparable harm to the bitcon ecosystem.

I was under the impression that it was every state, but it seems that maybe half of the states have these laws in place.  There was also a big court decision in 2013 which deemed it legal for merchants to charge surcharges on credit card transactoins only.  Laws prohibiting surcharges on debit and prepaid cards are still on the books, and despite the court case, 10 states still outlaw surcharges on credit card payments.  States like connecticut include essentially all forms of payment in he law.  
Conn. Gen. Stat. §42-133ff
(a) No seller may impose a surcharge on a buyer who elects to use any method of payment, including, but not limited to, cash, check, credit card or electronic means, in any sales transaction.

The existing payment rails are high-overhead because they're compliant with regs, and provide counterparty risk.  These are both still present in the system you propose.  You need centralized agencies to convert between bitcoin and fiat.  There's just as much friction with coinbase having to change money on either end of the transaction than there is with PayPal.  
Regarding the whitepaper, I quote:  "Commerce on the Internet has come to **rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments**. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model."
I didn't see Satoshi say, "therefore, we need to move the trusted third parties to the onramps and offramps of bitcoin to solve this problem."

It just took me 5 minutes to send bitcoin to coinforcoffee.  even after having blockchain set as the default app to handle bitcoin tx's, I still had to manually copy and paste the bitcoin address and exact amount from coinforcoffee to my blockchain app (coinforcoffee didn't properly populate the information).  I tried to instead use coinbase, which required 2FA and new device autentication via e-mail.  Yeah.
EDIT:  After sending bitcoin to coinforcoffee via coinbase, I got a message that "It's taking longer than expected to process your payment right now" with a button to refund my balance.  Epic fail.
EDIT 2:  The "refund balance now" button doesn't work.  what the fuck.

I will concede that decentralization does not add significant value to the consumer, especially since the fees inherent to centralized systems are borne by merchants.

The red team (Republicans) have a large constituency of evangelical christians who need to be placated in order to win, especially in a presidential election.  The blue team (Democrats) have a large constituency of government employees who rely on wealth redistribution and taxation for their livelihood.  Thus, being a pro-choice republican is political suicide, and being a pro-market democrat is the same.  If you believe both, there is no place for you in American politics, which is dominated by these two parties.  Libertarians are forced to join one of the two major parties and say things they don't believe in order to trojan horse their way into office.

He's against core because *he* isn't the one calling the shots.  He has complete control over the BU ecosystem, which is what he wants.  Control.  This is what this is about.  He didn't have as much control over core as he wanted, and realized this when most of the core devs opposed a hard fork block size increase.  His reaction is to paint all of core as 'bought and paid for' and convince himself and others that there's some sort of conspiracy happening because some developers happen to be getting some outside funding, and they also happen to disagree with his layman analysis of how bitcoin should scale.  Meanwhile, he is *single-handedly* funding essentially the *entire* BU ecosystem.

So if i read this correctly, about 70% of all bitcoin are held at addresses containing &gt;100 BTC, and about 50% of all bitcoin are held at addresses containing &gt;500 BTC...  Imagine if 50% of US Dollars were held in bank accounts that were individually worth over 1/26,000th of the entire money supply (500 / 13Million btc).  Those would be accounts worth over $50Million.  This would mean that a maximum of 26,000 people would own 50% of the outstanding wealth.  Given 6 billion participants in a hypothetical future bitcoin economy, that would translate to the top 0.00043% owning 50% of the entire bitcoin economy. Talk about wealth disparity. As a comparison, in the US, the top 1% of Americans own 40% of the wealth.  Adjusted for 500 Million participants (approximate population of the US), bitcoin would still have about 2000x more wealth disparity than the there currently is in the United States.  Bitcoin will have a very hard time scaling with the current wealth distribution.  
Edit:  I actually under-estimated the bitcoin wealth disparity.  Upon reading the chart again, 50% of all bitcoin are actually held at addresses containing &gt;1,000 BTC, not 500 as I originally calculated.  This means that 50% of all coins are held in accounts representing more than 1/13,000th of the entire outstanding money supply (approx 13 million coins).  In a hypothetical 6 billion participant bitcoin economy, This would mean the top 0.000215% own 50% of the wealth.  Adjusted for a bitcoin economy with the same number of participants as there are US citizens, that's approx. 4000x higher wealth disparity than the current US economy.

There was a "Bill Nye vs Ken Ham" moment here at one point.  Bruce Fenton asked Jake (BU guy who filled in after Roger left) "is there anything Core can do to change your mind and get you to support the efforts of Core?"  He responded "no".  Bruce continued, "Even if Core advocated exactly what BU is advocating as a scaling solution?"  He again responded "No".  This reminded me of Ken Ham's response to Bill Nye when he was asked if there was any evidence that could possibly convince him to change his mind, and Ham said no, because he values a strict adherence to his faith over reason.  My point is that Ver has essentially created an anti-core cult.  Bitcoin Jesus, indeed.

They don't have to worry about the tax funnel running dry.  They can seize all the bitcoins held at regulated exchanges at will, and force you to take paper in return.  If you think that's crazy and would never happenen, that exact thing happened in 1933 when the US government banned gold ownership.

It would be hard to compromise in the direction of what BU is advocating, because either you hard fork or you don't.

It's pretty easy to do that when you aren't actually sending bitcoins, as is the case here.  You're actually sending IOU Bitcoin via SMS, so when the recipient creates a "Zebpay" account with that phone number, they will have numbers in their account balance.  No bitcoins have actually moved, and the recipient is obviously required to use Zebpay.  There is absolutely nothing innovative about it.  What we should be doing is finding ways to actually send *real* bitcoin in this way.  It can be done with multisig, it just takes more time and money than centralizing everything and creating a paypal clone that impresses noobs.

If the exchange rate went down, the value of your bitcoin would have gone down anyway had you not hedged to USD.  So the scheme let you cap your potential losses at the % of the commission fee, which I believe was less than 10% ... from what I've heard ... so it's basically allowing you to be long on bitcoin while capping your downside risk.  This was particularly worthwhile during the March 2013 bubble.  In the coinbase example, the downside risk is only the fee your bank will charge you, and the upside is, as always, the moon.

By its very design, bitcoin makes a political statement rejecting certain economic theories which require a manipulated money supply.  You cannot say that bitcoin is compatable with keynesean economic theory (a doctrine championed by most liberal economists), because it's hard-coded to mirror a commodity standard. Bitcoin was also created with a very clear statement against trusted third parties as payment intermediaries.  It's literally the first sentence of the whitepaper.  This is because the entire motivation behind creating a system like bitcoin was to prevent governments from being able to interfere with money, just like bit torrent was created to prevent governments from being able to interfere with file sharing. As it stands, with most bitcoin being held in government-regulated bitcoin banks, we are failing at reaching those ends.  This is the file-sharing equivalent of most torrent files being hosted on a few government-regulated servers which store the personal information of all the file owners.

It's important to note that the Circle app is almost certainly not actually signing a bitcoin transaction via NFC.  They are likely obtaining the requested amount from the merchant via NFC, then telling their server to send that amount from their reserves.  This is very different than the Bitcoin Wallet for Android app (and now mycelium, I believe), which sign the transaction directly via NFC and does not rely on a central server.  One method is peer-to-peer, the other is not.
@_date: 2015-01-23 07:25:56
He also says he wishes he could have thought of something like nubits or bitUSD:  
"[creating a coin with stable value] would have required a trusted party to determine the value, because I don't know a way for software to know the real world value of things. If there was some clever way, or if we wanted to trust someone to actively manage the money supply to peg it to something, the rules could have been programmed for that."

This may be an unpopular opinion these days, but I don't think Circle,  Coinbase, Xapo, or other services that have full control over user's bitcoins should be considered "wallets".  Calling them Bitcoin Banks would be more appropriate.  Using the term "wallet" as loosely as this blurs the distinction between true "wallets" and IOU Bitcoin services.   Maybe someone could propose making a separate distinction on bitcoin.org.  Listing bank/exchanges in the same category as Coinkite and GreenAddress is quite misleading. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 19:16:41
The fact that a goverment could order Coinbase, Circle, Xapo, etc. to confiscate users bitcoin deposts and replace them fiat at a given exchange rate at any point in time should be troubling to everyone in this space.  Satoshi himself was even lukewarm about the idea of web wallets like blockchain.info, where users still held their own private keys.  We've strayed very far from the ideals that sparked a bitcoin in the first place, and that were predominant during bitcoin's early days.  AML/KYC is now taken as a given, but when it was first being discussed, most in the community realized that this would mean that "market based centralization" would become "coercive centralization".

The problem is that "market-based centralization" is actually an extension of "coercive centralization", since centralized companies comply with coercive laws.  The US government was able to easily confiscate everyone's gold and replace it with fiat in 1933 because most of their gold was held by regulated institutions who had to comply under a coercive threat by government.  If 90% of bitcoin are being held at centralized institutions that are regulated by governments, then bitcoin is, for all intents and purposes, centralized.  It's not inconceivable that under government edict, all bitcoin holders within a geographical area called the "united states" would be required to forfeit their bitcoin at a given exchange rate with government currency, just like they did with gold... and Coinbase, Circle, Xapo, et. al. would proceed to hault withdrawals, and give all US account holders some fresh fiat.  You can say this is a tinfoil hat scenario, but I'm sure they might have said the same in 1932.  And even if you don't think a scenario like this might actually happen, the fact that it *can* happen under current conditions should be very troubling.

This is actually the same way that silk road vendors were scamming Ross with the hedging.  Vendors would buy items from themselves and lock in the price in US Dollars.  If the exchange rate went up, they would cancel the order and the refunded bitcoin would be worth more than the initial purchase amount.  If the exchange rate went down, they would process the order at no loss.  This created a scenario where there was no downside risk to holding bitcoin.

It's impossible for anything to cost 200% less than something else, unless they're paying you.  If you're talking about the difference between paypal's 3% fees and coinbase's 2% fee for fiat-in, fiat-out transactions (1% to buy, 1% to sell), that would be 33% less cost.
But wait until coinbase needs to move on from the rapid onboarding phase and start monetizing to justify their $400m valuation.  PayPal also used to pay you $10 to sign up, and had no transaction fees... until they needed to start making money.

This is because we're putting the cart before the horse.

They don't realize it because they aren't paying 3-5% in credit card fees.  The merchant is.  Any increase in product costs that is the result of these fees on the merchant's end is invisible to the customer.   On the other hand, the customer *does* see how much they're paying in bitcoin transaction fees.  So in their mind, the comparison is free (cards) vs. paying a fee (bitcoin).  If the fee is nominal this might not be a huge deterrent to mainstream consumer adoption.  But as soon as the fees become substantive, it will greatly hinder adoption / drive people to alts.

Segwit is the compromise.  Before segwit, the options were hard fork (XT at the time), or keep a hard 1MB cap.  Segwit should have been seen as a godsend, because now the 'other side' was able to deliver a doubling of the effective block size without needing a hard fork, with some very important fixes along with it.  But instead of being reasonable, parts of the hard-fork crowd became an anti-core crowd who will oppose anything they do.

He completely dodged the question.  Wealth inequality in the bitcoin ecosystem has the potential to make the current system look like a model of egalitarianism.  I ran the numbers a while back, and at full scale it is something like 0.003% of the world population owning 50% of all the wealth.  As long as Satoshi and the roger ver's of the world keep hodling and don't diversify, this will be very unhealthy for the economy overall, and a giant anchor that hinders bitcoin's ability to reach mass adoption.  Who will want to opt out of a rigged system to participate in a system that's 1000x more rigged?  We clamor at how unfair it is that that banks get dollars first, and spend them into the economy before inflation hits.. but what about the people who are holding massive amounts of bitcoin before 99.9% of the world have them, and have to buy in at a much, much higher rate?

Well, I think we're talking about two different types of evidence.  Evidence that 2x will lead to more expensive nodes?  Sure.  Evidence that 2x will likely have more hashrate than the current chain, based on current signalling, and thus be considered 'bitcoin'?  Yes, this is also the case.
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:10:47
I think an important thing to note is that 'off-chain' does not have to be incompatible with the cryptoanarchist vision that many of us have.  I am personally guilty of once believing that 'off-chain' is inherently antithetical to my ideals as a cryptoanarchist.  I think that many still hold this belief, not being aware that there are ways to bring things off-chain in a trustless, distributed fashion.  
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:33:00
This mentality is why the core chain is about to become 'bitcoin legacy'.  You are ignoring reality.  There is no man in the sky.  You do not get to define what "real bitcoin" is. But I get it.  You are prone to religious thinking. 95% of the scientific community is in consensus that evolution occurred, but you are still holding your convictions against it.  The world operates in base 10, but you think we should use dozenal.  The overwhelming majority of miners are signalling for 2x, and will mine on the 2x chain, yet you are holding onto your biblical convictions in spite of evidence.  In spite of reality.  This is not the type of thinking this community needs, I'm sorry.

Your logic is not wrong.  The upside of alts is greater than the upside of bitcoin.  That is why we have the alt bubble that we have.  A rational investor will determine that they can potentially profit more by buying and pumping and alt than by hodling bitcoin. (see: BCH / Roger Ver, every ICO, etc).  But as others have mentioned, these are all riskier investments than bitcoin.

I was hoping the reader of my post would be able to think critically enough to see through the stigma of the word "money laundering" and come to the conclusion that money laundering is simply the act of moving value across imaginary lines or obfuscating the source of money to avoid laws enforced within those imaginary lines or the theft of a percentage of one's personal wealth ("taxation").  My point is that when you call "money laundering" for what it is, I think most people would agree that it's not something that should be prohibited, and only exists for political reasons.  But unfortunately they don't call it "money liberation", so it must take a good amount of effort for some to think outside the box on this.

There is nothing innovative here, and is actually quite dangerous if wallets actually start integrating these colored coin IOU's.  There are actual cryptocurrencies which maintain a US Dollar peg without needing an AML/KYC compliant issuer.  You're reinventing the wheel here.  Whether it's a blockchain-based IOU USD or a PayPal USD, it's still an IOU USD with a single issuer and a single point of failure.  Based on the latest finCEN guidance, these IOU issuers will be required to attain the same private information from users as PayPal does.  So basically what you are is a middle man for an IOU issuer.  It's like you're issuing PayPal dollars as a colored coin.  It's actually much quicker to use a centralized service, and they still have the same amount of compliance, friction, overhead, etc as any other IOU issuer.

I tend to think that expanding bitcoin's user base via centralized services is a bit like shooting ourselves in the foot.  I'd much rather for non-custodial services to catch up to the bank-style models in ease of use, so we no longer need to point newbies to bitcoin banks.  That's a difficult task given that buying / selling bitcoin is heavily regulated, but this can be done externally while a user has the coin automatically sent to a wallet they fully control.  I think detaching wallets and merchant software from the business of money exchanging should be the goal, given one activity requires the company to be heavily regulated and the others do not.  Right now the biggest wallet providers are also in the bitcoin buying / selling business, and are forced to control user bitcoins at the whims of governments.

Think about this offer for a second.  Why is Coinbase able to do this?  They can do this because they're centralized, and they can just add $25 worth of IOU bitcoin (or fiat) into someone's account.  It's impossible for non-custodial / decentralized / zero-knowledge services to do this.  The result is that more and more people will be drawn to these bitcoin banks (coinbase, circle, xapo, etc.) that have tons of VC cash and can afford to take a loss to acquire users, and less people will be using bitcoin as intended - as a censorship-resistant, decentralized currency.  Bitcoin banks are inherently pro-censorship and centralized.  Every bitcoin stored at Coinbase is functionally under the control of a government.  We promote the use of these services for the sake of 'increasing adoption' at our own peril.  While we believe we're increasing bitcoin adoption, we're also increasing the percentage of the bitcoin ecosystem that is under the direct control of governments.

Exactly.  The "PayPal for bitcoin" model was low hanging fruit, and many companies jumped on board quick.  A site like coinbase can be coded in a weekend.  These types of services have been around for over 3 decades.  It's much more difficult to make a service with that level of usability that doesn't require control of people's money.  We're now getting much closer, and the community needs to get behind these efforts.

No, your argument was that you feel better about storing your cash with a third party, and feel similarly about bitcoin.

No way.  Non-custodial bitcoin will become just as easy as coinbase.  Believe me.  Just give it some time.  The biggest problem is that a service like Coinbase can be built by a freelance developer for less than $2000.  Centralized web-based payment platforms have existed for literally 2 decades.  Changing the unit from USD to BTC and setting up a hot and cold wallet would take a few hours.  It's much harder to build easy to use non-custodial wallet services.  It's getting easier, though.

We can't do anything about the fact that buying bitcoin with fiat is heavily regulated.  What we *can* do is try to detach wallet services from the business of buying / selling bitcoin.  Wallets can be wallets, and brokers can be brokers, and people can buy bitcoin from directly within a wallet they control.  The only service that would have allowed this to happen by offering a white-labeled exchange API was buttercoin, and they went out of business.

It seemed on the surface to be a ploy to defraud the Australian Tax Authority into allowing him to claim millions in tax credits against spending non-existent bitcoin on R&amp;D.

This is actually legal in most US states already, but does require a doctor to sign off on the requisition, so this aspect would lack anonymity, but there is no reason for patients to actually visit a doctor to order blood work, and almost nobody even knows that you can order your own without needing a visit to the doctor.

The way that chess moves are expressed could be components of a base-58 private key.  For example, there is an image of a bird in the painting, and there is a chess move called bird's opening, which expressed as a chess move is "1. f4", or "f4 d5" if considering the opponent's move.  See other popular opening moves here:   You'll note that all of them could be components to a base-58 private key, given each chess square being represented on a grid of 1-8, a-h, and each piece being represented by the first letter of its name (e.g. Kf2, or Ra4).   The other image in the painting is of a Knight and Bishop, which may represent a knight-bishop checkmate.

Bitcoin supply was already inflated when Mt. Gox held fractional reserves.  The functional supply was greater than the actual supply. This is becasue IOU bitcoin trade like real bitcoin.

True.. although that would mean that whoever is running the bizarro-Willybot needed to increase their bitcoin liability and decrease their fiat liability.  Gox had the opposite problem.  They ran out of actual bitcoin, so in order to reduce the amount of Bitcoin that were owed to their customers, they had to create IOU Fiat to buy IOU bitcoin, regardless of the price, in order to reduce the amount of real bitcoin owed to customers and keep the ponzi afloat.  Unfortunately for gox, people also wanted to withdraw their IOU fiat.

More accurately, Circle is converting IOU USD to IOU Bitcoin, which circle will send on your behalf to a destination.

So let's say it comes out to $270/capita when you divide the entire base money supply by the number of people on earth.  If .0028 BTC was $270, that means that the price per bitcoin would be just under $100,000.  Not even 5x the most recent highs.

What does intent have to do with anything?  Invading your privacy is invading your privacy.  That's like saying the NSA is there to catch bad guys, not invade privacy, so it's ok.  
The fact of the matter is that the US government has the ability to confiscate all of your bitcoin holdings at coinbase or any hosted wallet if they so choose, and have access to information about the source and destination of all your transactions.  Now I know the government is made of well-intentioned angels, which by your logic would make this justified, but let's assume for a second that this may not be the case.

There was a small discrepancy between Gox and the other exchanges.  It's likely that willy created a self-fulfilling prophecy in the market, given that Gox controlled a large amount of the global exchange volume.  So in effect, willy was "dragging" the price up along with it.  The rest of the market agreed to pay high prices because they believed they could send the real coins to Mt.Gox and get willy-inflated prices.

You need to read more.  There are egalitarian theories where resources are allocated equally, and require no medium of exchange.  See: Anarcho-communism.  Also, if you do think that capitalism is inherently "fair", do you think it's fair that 0.001% of bitcoin users hold 50% of the outstanding supply?  And that a single person owns over 7%?   Do you think it's fair that if I buy bitcoin today, I can lose half my purchasing power by tomorrow?  Just food for thought.

Bitcoin is an ideology.  It has ideology built directly into the protocol.  It inherently supports a fixed money supply without a central issuer as opposed to an elastic money supply.

This is false.  Satoshi said, in his own words, that the 21 million cap was an "educated guess".  He wanted one unit to eventually roughly represent the value of one unit of fiat currency that people are familiar with, and struggled with where to place the decimal place given the wide range of adoption possibilities.  He finally decided to put the decimal in between the two extremes that he was considering, and even noted that the decimal could be moved in the future if need be.  I believe he talked about this on the cryptography mailing list where he initially announced bitcoin, although it may have been a bitcointalk post, I can't recall at the moment.

You can say the same thing about cash.  The difference is that with bitcoin, there isn't a need to put trust in someone else to store or send value, but most people are used to the paternalism of a bank.  It's our job to make them unnecessary, not cheer when Goldman Sachs invests in one.

In the race to be early movers in this ecosystem, the easiest way to get a bitcoin service up and running was to centralize everything.  You could get a service like Coinbase up and running in less than a month's time, whereas developing a peer-to-peer service needed to be done from the ground up - at the bleeding edge of innovation.  To make matters worse, due to the regulations surrounding buying and selling bitcoin, this activity is much more efficient when done centrally as opposed to peer to peer.  As the ecosystem matures, decentralized, non-custodial services are inching closer to the centralized services in terms of ease-of-use and utility.  Once this gap is narrow enough, services like Circle and Coinbase should be discarded in favor of non-custodial services that can't freeze your account for buying a knife or sending funds overseas, or limit bitcoin withdrawals to 0.8 per week.  Bitcoin is only disruptive as long as it's decentralized.

Technologically, very solvable.  As far as regulation goes, that's a different story.


Yes.  What happens when you have $300 worth of bitcoin, make a $300 purchase, and the price drops to $280 before they can liquidate?  Also, from a legal standpoint, they are investing 100% of your USD balance in a different asset.  They would probably have to be regulated as a full-blown investment fund.
Also, let's focus on making spending *actual* bitcoin easier.  These 'bitcoin* debit card' efforts might be convenient for people who already use bitcoin to get easy liquidity, but in doing so we're losing focus on the larger goal.

Rather than focusing their model on increasing adoption, they simply assumed that adoption would increase on its own.  This has an element of the 'public good problem', where no single company is incentivized enough to focus resources on incrasing bitcoin adoption, but it's also a byproduct of founders who are more opportunists than idealists.
@_date: 2015-11-08 22:17:09
For the average consumer, they will hire bitcoin if it makes them feel good when they use it.  You can see examples of this in the adoption of the Starbucks app (getting a gold star when you make a purchase makes people feel good), and Venmo (emojis make payments fun).  They do not care about nor benefit from decentralization, privacy, or trust-minimization.  It's our job to make sure these properties are retained when building consumer-facing products.
It seems that avid users are divided into two very distinct groups:  Idealists and opportunists / pragmatists.  The idealists tend to share similar ideals in how this technology can shape society by introducing a payment system that cannot be controlled by governments or central authorities.  The opportunists are individuals who do not share these philosophical leanings, and are involved in the bitcoin community because they see it as an opportunity to either make money as an investment, or in the startup world to use their prior experience in silicon valley to receive funding and easily bootstrap a payments startup, or capitalize on 'blockchain buzz' in hopes of being acquired by a bank.  Individuals in these two groups would likely give very different answers as to why they would 'hire' bitcoin, or why they believe others might want to.
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:13:31
If this were to become the status quo for 'bitcoin' payments, it would ensure that actual bitcoin would never be used in point-of-sale, only fiat payments from bitcoin banks.

I hope you realize that even when you 'replace' bitcoin by buying more IOU's from coinbase, this still doesn't hit the blockchain.  It's entirely closed loop.  Buying bitcoin from coinbase and spending it with a shift visa card occurs entirely outside the bitcoin ecosystem.  It does, however, create at least one transaction on the visa network, and possibly two if you initially buy the bitcoin with a visa card.  What's more alarming is the 1000+ upvotes and songs of praise from the bitcoin community when this was announced.

Bitcoin does need adoption.  But coinbase IOU units aren't bitcoin, nor are Circle IOU USD's.  When you centralize bitcoin like this, you lose nearly all of its benefits over traditional payment rails.  Adoption of 'bitcoin' via bitcoin banks will lead to a very centralized, high-friction, trust-dependent ecosystem.  Case in point, Circle's absurd bitcoin withdrawal limits and censorship of transactions.  We can do better.

Maybe it's just me, but I'm not quite sure that the 'philosophy of bitcoin' jives with using visa and mastercard and claiming you're letting people "spend their bitcoin", but really just selling them prepaid visa and mastercards for their bitcoin (at a terrible exchange rate nonetheless).  Using your system people are using the exact payment rails that bitcoin was created to eliminate.. seems to be quite literally the opposite of the 'philosophy of bitcoin', but what do I know.

No, because the word "apple" had no meaning in the *computer industry* when they branded their company.  In the world of trademark law, "Apple" would be considered an "arbitrary mark", which is defined as a common word used **in a meaningless context**.  This would be the bitcoin equivalent of "Circle".  Blockchain.info is marketing their services as "Blockchain".  In trademark law, the word blockchain would be considered a "term of art" in the industry in which the services are being provided.  This would disqualify it from being registered as a trademark.  If they tried to trademark it, it would be rejected on multiple grounds, including being considered "descriptive".  A descriptive mark is a word or phrase that describes an aspect of the services being provided.  This is the equivalent of AOL having branded themselves "Internet", or simply "Online".  You can see how this might cause a bit of confusion among consumers.  So your Apple analogy is absurd - that is, unless you mistakenly believed that a processing core in an apple computer is literally an apple core.

If 1% of the world adopted bitcoin (for ALL their economic activity.)  We still have quite a way to go.  
According to this rudimentary way of assessing the value of bitcoin, at the current price of $250 (3.5 billion market cap), that would correlate to .00046% of all outstanding currency.  That percentage of the global population is about 3.2 Million people who would have to be bitcoin users and use bitcoin for all of their economic activity in order to justify its current price.  It's clear that bitcoin's present value is the result of a significant degree of speculation rather than its actual utility.  Maybe this will change in the future.

I think you might be having trouble because people realize that the adoption of POS system by merchants requires a very significant capital investment - merchants need to be actively solicited, they need to be trained on how to use the system, they need to know how to train their employees, how to redeem their money, etc.  A cheap open source solution is nice, but I think that most might see it as infeasible that merchants would actually adopt a solution like this.

It's one thing to be bridging the gap between fiat and *bitcoin*.  But coinbase users never actually hold bitcoin.  Right now they're bridging the gap between fiat and IOU USD's that track the value of bitcoins, sometimes, when you're not holding funds in your USD wallet.

The motivation behind bitcoin's creation was deeply rooted in crypto-anarchism.  Satoshi stood on the shoulders of giants like David Chaum, Adam Back, Nick Szabo, Hal Finney and many others with a shared a vision of a less authoritarian future.  They didn't try for decades to create an anonymous digital currency so they could make a slightly better form of regulated, government-accessible money.

They now cap the amount of bitcoin you can withdraw per week, but allow you to deposit an unlimited amount.  They changed the policy without prior warning, so many people with large sums in 'circle bank' are still trying to slowly withdraw their coin.

They need to make sure there can't be a run on bitcoin, and by capping withdrawals they can plan their reserves accordingly.

The problem is that it's inherently easier for consumers to use Visa (pull) than bitcoin (push).  You can incentivize merchants all you want, but it's *users* that need to be properly incentived in order to drive adoption of a new technology.  It's simply easier to have a merchant pull money than to have to push money.  Having a debit card stored on your uber account is inherently easier than having to actively make a payment.  The best way to go about driving consumer adoption is to focus on making it easy and worthwhile for average people to spend *actual* bitcoins, rather than being so short sighted as to think you're going to drive consumer adoption of bitcoin in the long run by issuing a visa debit card that spends fiat and simply tracks the value of bitcoin.  This isn't "bridging a gap".  This is burning down the bridge.

He received millions of dollars in (possibly illegitimate) R&amp;D subsidies from the Australian government under the pretense that he is Satoshi Nakamoto.  Instead of actually spending money on R&amp;D, he told them the money he spent on R&amp;D was bitcoin that he "signed over the rights to" without actually moving them.  If he's not nakamoto, then the reality is that never spent anything, and scammed the Australian government out of millions of dollars.  He stands to face many years in prison.  His only chance is to convince the Australian tax authorities that he actually is satoshi nakamoto, and that he actually did own the bitcoin that he claims he spent for R&amp;D purposes.  That seems like enough incentive to me.

Automatically backing up a user's wallet when they sign up without them having to do anything.  Bitgo does this via emailing a user encrypted mater private keys.  AirBitz does this, I believe, by asking security questions and encrypting a user's key using the answers.  Sure they rely on varying degrees of trust, but as far as I'm concerned, requiring a lay user to actively back up a wallet in order for their coins to be safe is very irresponsible.

Are you advocating more participation on ethical grounds or emperical grounds?  Ethically, you might say that everyone should participate out of fairness.  This is a pure democracy.  If, however, you want the result to be a more informed outcome, then more participation is antithetical to that outcome.  This is because voters lose their incentive to make an informed decision the less chance their individual vote has to influence the outcome, and the less invested they are in the outcome.  If you want desirable outcomes, you may advocate a system whereby only the most informed and engaged individuals would be able to cast a vote.  There is certainly no way to quantify who is worthy of meeting this criteria, since it is indeed subjective, but being a member of the bitcoin foundation is a decent vetting process.

If circle was "built atop of bitcoin" that would be a different story.  I'm upset because centralized companies running centralized ledgers and operating as bitcoin banks are detrimental to the long term health of the ecosystem... ESPECIALLY when they're pushing for their services to be used for daily spending transactions.  They are not a bitcoin company, they are an "IOU money" company that allows users to redeem the IOU's for bitcoin... sometimes.. if you're not buying a knife or sending over a certain amount... or sending money to someone the US government doesn't approve of.   This is not disruptive.  These are the same impediments faced by the existing system.  Companies like circle are using buzzwords to raise more investment rounds from sucker VC's.  There is nothing disruptive about what they're doing.

If that's your mentality, why use bitcoin in the first place?  Bitcoin was created to eliminate the need for third parties in financial transactions, for various reasons including resistance to censorship and reducing friction.  Our goal should be to make using and storing bitcoin just as safe and easy as using a bitcoin bank.  The problem is, it's easy to build a PayPal / Coinbase.  It's hard to build a true bitcoin wallet service that's just as easy to use.  We're getting there, but saying that trusted third parties will inevitably be a large part of the ecosystem is waiving the white flag on the bitcoin project entirely.

They then asked me to text them a bitcoin address to send the refund.

99.9% of the general population have no idea what counterparty risk is.  They have a problem that they don't realize they have.  That's something that people with your mentality fail to realize.  Does a bitcoin ecosystem with 99% of users using paypal-like "wallets" that are accessible to governments sound attractive to you?  The solution is that people like us need to stop promoting services that are off-chain and that compromise identity.  Coinbase is only acceptable if you buy directly into a multi-sig wallet, because they are required to track where BTC 'withdrawals' go.  Most people won't use coinbase with their multisig vault, so therefore we should either stop telling people to use coinbase, or always qualify your recommendation of coinbase by telling users to only use the multi-sig vault.

If someone doesn't uphold their end of a contract, the DRO of the damaged party and the DRO of the offender will have to resolve the conflict.  The DRO's will likely have agreed to use a pre-determined arbitrator to make a decision in such scenarios, and the agencies will agree to what actions need to be taken based on the arbitrator's decision.  The DRO's have an economic incentive to play by the rules and not buck the system.  The arbitrators also have an economic incentive to make unbiased decisions, since DRO's won't agree to use arbitrators who are known to be biased / corrupt.  DRO's decentralize law, essentially.  The "law" emerges from agreements between different agencies regarding the rules for disputes between their customers.  So the "law" might be different depending on who you're dealing with, and the laws may actually end up being very un-libertarian depending on where you are / who you're dealing with.

At 2:24 he slips up, if you read into what he said.  He called bit gold a 'transparent' attempt to make a digital currency.  In his mind, it's likely that he was comparing bit gold (which he worked on transparently and in the open) to bitcoin which he obviously did not.  There would be no good reason to add that bit gold was a 'transparent' attempt, because that is usually a given when you're discussing your own project / idea.  He seems to catch himself as he was saying it.

He says that they're completely non-custodial, and then he says that they make money by giving the recipient a low fiat exchange rate when they see the balance in their wallet.  So where does the difference go?  Are they programming the wallet to send them a second behind-the-scenes bitcoin transaction along with transaction sent?  If they're programming their app to send X amount of the customer's money to themselves, then that's hardly non-custodial.  They have a backdoor to seize all of your funds.

Indeed.. he was very wishy-washy when pressed on the details of how exactly they're making money off of this.  Maybe he's talking about taking a cut from the profits the teller makes?

I'm also not a lawyer but I'm currently incorporating a bitcoin company in the US and thus understand these laws very well, as I'm sure Brian does despite his claiming ignorance. 
I'll answer for Brian: 
Coinbase has a big legal problem.  We've let our users buy bitcoin (more accurately, claims to bitcoin) directly into their hosted wallets.  Because of this, the bitcoin are still in Coinbase's possession, and we're acting as money transmitters on our customers' behalf.  Thus, we have a legal responsibility to perform due diligence on EVERY transaction leaving our hosted wallet.  This includes bitcoin that arrived there from another location.  When you send bitcoin from your coinbase wallet, *you* are not sending it, *we* are, so we're legally responsible to know where the bitcoin are going.    
When Coinbase decided to take the blue pill in the early days, we carved a path for ourselves that has led us to stray from the ideals that make people passionate about bitcoin in the first place.  We decided that raising money was more important than those ideals.  We went so far as to partner with some of the very institutions that Bitcoin was created to render obsolete - and we've even become one of those very institutions ourselves.  And for that, I'm sorry.  Due to our need to comply with regulations, we've built a company that waters down the utility of bitcoin by subjecting all transactions we initiate on behalf of our customers to governmental scrutiny.  If I had the ability to do it over, I would have done it much, much differently.
