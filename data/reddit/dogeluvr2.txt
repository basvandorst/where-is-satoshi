I think total minable BTC is 21 million as you say, but the experts say that about 4 million has been lost or locked up. So about 17 million total to mine or in hodlers hands.   Key stat is that there are more than 17 million, millionaires in the world and if they all want just one BTC, there aren't enuf!!!
