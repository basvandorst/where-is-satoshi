Yeah i mean, crypto is volatile. If you invest in this space its something you just have to accept.

i'm surprised your boss was even able to set up mining equipment properly and actually mine...

No, you are, because we both know bitcoin is not going to be incorporating those services.

can bitcoin render my 3d models on a decentralized network?
is bitcoin decentralized file storage?
hmm, seems like you're wrong then.

The day i stopped day trading alts was the day i started being able to focus more on daily life.

break the cycle - miss some gains on alts, you're already still way ahead of the curve. what good are your crypto earnings going to be if you have shit health, stress, and no other focal point in your life you know? plus, aside from the bullish run on bitcoin recently, my portfolio is up 25% from last month and i've made less bad calls which means i've lost less money and don't beat myself up so much.

hijacking top comment -- what does OP mean when they say: 


I know crypto and each crypto transaction is taxed like capital gains but super not knowledgable about taxes so why wouldnt they have to pay capital gains if they keep their crypto transactions/selling $37.5k or lower?

Awesome to have you respond to my comment! If you ever need any ideas of where to donate next, multiple sclerosis research would touch my heart :)

it has been picked up by major news sources, pretty much since the inception of the pineapple fund...
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:07:54
no problem at all, only question i have is what crypto APIs did you use?

Came to ask if you made it in electron as well. We're starting to use Vue at work, so I'm digging this. Do you have source code you'd be willing to share, no worries if not.

Also factor in where the person lives. You can get a [recession special in NYC at Greys Papaya]( for &lt; $5 but sometimes that shit's expensive if you live in NYC, SF, etc.

you're fine unless you're on a commodore 64

while you dont need to trust his opinion on bitcoin, hes far from some one trick pony dude... Apple I, most of the Apple II, first universal remote that made it to market, had a big hand in developing GPS technology, helped found the freaking EFF, and actually gives a shit about the status of tech education in the United States. I've never actually encountered someone so salty on woz before - whats your deal?
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:53:25
I'm guessing this is poking fun at right?
@_date: 2017-07-01 14:13:14
i can see why people think you're lying now
@_date: 2017-07-01 14:12:21
why not show proof? not sure why you're hostile about it.
