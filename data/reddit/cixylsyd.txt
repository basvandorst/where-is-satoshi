But in the proposed scenario the guy with the coins wouldn't be the defendant. It's not a criminal trial unless he's charged and that means the burden of proof is on him since he'd be making the claim that the government had *his* coins. There are very different procedures between criminal and civil cases too.

1. As has been mentioned, you missed the window to file a claim.
2. You have no way to prove they weren't going to be used nefariously. Proof is moot in this argument.
There was a guy who tried filing a claim but iirc they essentially accused him of money laundering and denied the claim.

Imagine being the descendant of that guy who threw away his hard drive at that point.
"Well we would own a few small countries, but a couple hundred years ago my great great great grandfather threw away the global GDP of the previous millennia."

No, price is nosediving because people like you post shit like this and spark a panic sell reaction. Seriously, the front page has been covered for over a week. What the fuck do you expect people to do when they come here and see 5 posts on the front page "ZOMG GHASH IS GUNNA CRASH TEH ECONOMY"? You should be able to expect more people will sell off if more people are irrationally afraid of something, it happens in every market.

I always seem to forget that she lives in the same state as me, then fap furiously when I'm reminded.
