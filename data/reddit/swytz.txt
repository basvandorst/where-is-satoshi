Did you not realize when the DAA fork happened a couple months ago?  That was a hard software/consensus upgrade.
It's also worse that you ask for github, when ABC isn't really on github and I already provided you with the repo.
That said, here are full nodes, software-wise, compliant with the new protocol:
# Bitcoin ABC
# Bitcoin Unlimited
# Parity Bitcoin
# Bitcoin XT
# Bcoin
# Bitprim
# Bitcrust
If you really want github links, you can easily google the list.

I'm a blockchain developer who follows not only code updates, but you clearly didn't even read the canonical transaction ordering code plans, or graphene, or anything being planned for all of them. But you have a narrative you have to follow here, so cheers mate.

The page I linked is the real repository. Github isn't the real one. That said, there are 7 other development teams. Just odd for you to say there's zero.

Did you not read my second link?

I just want to know, do you really believe bitcoin cash is vaporware despite being worth valued in the billions? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:02:24
Yes, that's why upgrades are happening and it's worth tens of billions of dollars.  Makes sense, thanks for your input.

There are 8 development teams for it.

Still disproves your zero statement. Want me to link the others when I get home?

Who do you think this guy is?
How do you explain code being regularly committed here?
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:46:03
I literally linked you the road map and you didn't even glance at it. Lmao.

My 4850 gets about the same.

Because bitcoin has been artificially handicapped to 1mb blocks, which makes people have to fight and pay more in fees just to get in the next block. Look for bitcoin cash if you want to pay 1 sat/byte (less than a penny). They've mentioned plans about further reducing fees further, something like 1 sat per 10 bytes. But the fees are already so cheap on BCH that it's not a priority yet.

Should every currency on earth go fuck itself because they're all used to purchase (albeit unnecessarily illegal) substances?
