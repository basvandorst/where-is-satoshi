I'd really like some user experience reports on Coinbase vs. Circle, as well. Coinbase's "over the top" compliance with PATROIT/AML/KYC bullshit has become increasingly draconian and makes using the platform a real hassle. If Circle truly is a faster, friendlier (at least for now) service, I'd rather use it than fuddling around with LBC or Paxful. But I also don't want more services linked to my bank account than absolutely necessary...

Nobody "deserves" to have their coins lost, true, but by the same measure no one is immune from cause and effect.

OH NO A BAD WORD I DON'T LIEEEK EET
Look up the definition of the word "retard" and realize that it applies directly to you - it's an impediment to mental development, not necessarily disease, and you clearly have an impediment in understanding blockchain technology. 
As in " has a retarded understanding of on-chain fees in BTC."

Mate, your entire catalogue of posts is the definition of cherry-picking. I'm just trying to hold you to the same standard, that's all. Accountability and reputation are paramount in the crypto world, but this isn't the next MtGOX, Cryptsy, or even Parity, for that matter. 
Xpubs are always a de-facto methodology of showing your wallet balance - if your wallet software and the block explorer are at odds, it's a UI bug, not Grand Theft fuckin' Crypto. You chide at the notion that the "blockchain is law," but it is. That's how the technology works. 
I'm not a "regular" Exodus user, no, but I do recommend it to friends and family who are just getting started. I also make sure to explain the underlying technology and its pitfalls as best I can so they don't go spewing hyperbole on random Internet forums if something goes wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:28:30
Private keys are stored client-side and you're given a 12-word seed. Sure, open source wallets are usually preferable, but as closed-source wallets go Exodus ain't bad in the sovereignty department.
Compare that to Jaxx, whose customers were expeditiously parted from over $400k in funds earlier this year. Ouch: 
Mycelium, on the other hand, used their customers as unwitting guinea pigs for their spinoff company, Chainalysis, that now does work for DHS and the IRS. So "open source" ain't everything, either. Just ask Richard Stallman.
Android's technically "open source" but it's still the Windows of mobile phones, is that something to be proud of?

lol let's have a look at one of these "sources": 
The dude doesn't even know how exchange spreads work &gt;__&gt; 
Exodus certainly ain't perfect. Closed-source wallets aren't for me. I prefer Electrum, its forks, hardware wallets, and full nodes wherever possible, but this isn't about Exodus being shit.
It's about the fact that crypto nubs use Exodus because it's got a stylish, "dumbed down" interface and they don't know what the hell they're doing. Cryptocurrencies have a very steep learning curve and unfortunately this bull market has brought with it a slew of people who probably shouldn't be fucking around with technology they don't fully comprehend. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:53:49
Definitely a display bug, OP is full of it. Has since been fixed in recent releases, the bug was inflating coin balances in older versions. Happened to me, too, but was fixed shortly after an upgrade.
Even if Exodus had remained buggy, you've always got your pk's/seed, so I fail to see how this is some major crisis. Some of these quotes even look to be from users who don't understand what change addresses are.
Anyone worth their salt in crypto wouldn't be storing large amounts of coins on a light wallet client, anyways. Nubz runnin' wild tonight.

Are the two mutually exclusive, retard? They're not genuine investors, they're new. We're talking a couple hundred dollars at most.

@_date: 2015-01-21 23:16:37
It's how the "investment world" operates, unfortunately. No opinions needed, just look at COMEX holdings of GLD and SLV and then look at how many people ask for delivery. It's less than a fraction of one percent. Investors, those who don't care about using BitCoin (or gold or silver for that matter) for day-to-day activity, could care less where the actual coins are, or even if they're there at all.
So long as less than 5% or so of investors ask to hold the BitCoin in a personal wallet, nobody's the wiser. You gotta remember, the kind of people a BitCoin ETF will attract don't know a damn thing about BitCoin, the blockchain, or how it all works. Just as GLD investors don't understand how gold repatriation works.
The BitCoin community isn't yet concerned about what ETFs will do for true price discovery as most don't have a clue what kind of price-fixing mechanisms ETFs enable. I can't help but shake the feeling you're all about to find out the hard way in the coming years.
@_date: 2015-01-26 23:51:00
Wonderful retort, really flexing your intellectual muscles with that one.
@_date: 2015-01-21 02:01:50
ETFs. It'd trade like any other commodity at that point, with the ability to trade 10, 20, even 100 "Wall Street" Bitcoins for every "real" Bitcoin held in cold storage for physical delivery. Just like GLD and SLV currently operate.  You'll now have hundreds of thousands of people investing in and trading BTC without ever seeing a wallet or having a transaction take place in the blockchain; that'll be done by proprietary trading software, and you'll take it on "good faith" that your coins are actually deliverable. Most traders/investors will never ask for delivery to a personal wallet, ensuring the scheme operates in perpetuity. 
At that point, you'd simply peg the biggest dollar-based exchanges to the NYSE Bitcoin ETF price and everything else falls in line. Fully manipulable BTC price. 
It's up to the user base of Bitcoin at large to reject exchanges who are ushering in this price fixing mechanism, but given the current adoption of exchanges like CoinBase, who's clearly being set up to take the position of the ".gov/NYSE-approved" exchange, that looks like an uphill battle.

@_date: 2015-01-21 23:34:45
Exactly. ETFs for physical commodities are seldom more than a price fixing mechanism; at least with gold and silver, one could make the case that storage and trade of physical coins/bars is made easier by ETFs. But it makes no sense in an ecosystem like Bitcoin, which is already electronic, and thus, already has no storage and transmission concerns... unless your intent is to screw with price discovery. 
The second the IRS ruled Bitcoin was a "commodity" and not a currency, this type of market rigging was baked into the cake.
@_date: 2015-01-21 23:23:48
Barring your more subtle criticism of the Austrian school, there are a number of documentaries, books, and articles on this subject, but the most important of note are related to the gold repatriation movement of the last 5 years.
Germany, France, Argentina, Mexico, Belgium, and a number of other countries have been trying to ship gold from New York back to their home countries that was held by the Fed for "safe keeping" back in the Bretton Woods days... but they're not being allowed to repatriate, not even allowing a physical audit. Is the gold really even there anymore? Does it even matter if Germany has no physical access to it? 
The same happens to large personal players on the COMEX ETF market who ask for delivery, but on a smaller scale.
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:24:52
ETFs are a price-fixing mechanism, taking price discovery away from open exchanges and putting it in the hands of the NYSE/COMEX. Getting to the "Big League" means professional financial crime. You thought Willy the Whale was bad? You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Here's how ETF-based price manipulation works in gold, if you're interested: 
The same scheme is in operation in SLV: 
It continues to flabbergast me as to why folks here are so excited for an "Electronic Fund Transfer" in Bitcoin. Last time I checked, Bitcoin already was that; it's not a commodity with physical storage and delivery concerns. An ETF makes zero sense for cryptocurrencies, unless your intent is to hand over price discovery to Wall Street, which many here seem all too willing to do.
When the IRS ruled Bitcoin was a "commodity," folks like myself who've been in the precious metals market for any considerable period of time saw ETF-based manipulation coming a mile away. Now that it's rapidly approaching, the only real question is, how will the Bitcoin community respond? With vigilance against the financial criminals that Bitcoin replaces, or by kowtowing to Wall Street for the sake of "increased adoption?" 
@_date: 2015-01-18 00:05:38
Storing physical gold internationally without the use of ETFs requires insane amounts of trust in a traditionally (rightfully so) untrustworthy community, i.e. gold/silver bugs. The fact that his name carries such weight says a lot about his character.

Outright banning of new technologies in this day and age is notoriously difficult; look at Brazil, whose tobbaco lobby effectively made electronic cigarettes "illegal." Their use is still widespread, there's no will or impetus to enforce the law (let alone enforcement educated enough to know about it), and the "back alley" deals you describe have blossomed into a flourishing industry, albeit one that carries premiums above "white market" nations.
And this is with a physical product. Doing so with software? Fuggedaboutit.

Bitcoin doesn't have a London Bullion Market Association that pegs an international price outside of market forces once a week; useless to transpose two markets whose price discovery is so drastically different.

Excuse my botched terminology, you're correct. ETF does indeed stand for Electronic Fund Transfer in the banking world, but not for trading. Too many acronyms. 
That being said, I'm reluctant to accept a straw man in place of the crux of my argument. Do you deny that price discovery would shift from a multitude of exchanges to an institutional entity like CME in the event of a Bitcoin ETF?

...are you familiar with the phrase, "The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence?" Otherwise known as the appeal to ignorance? It's a logical fallacy. 
So no, it's not "pretty solid evidence," it's sophomoric reasoning at best. "They" could easily deploy thousands of nodes at any time for malicious purposes; "they" could buy a shitload of miners and double-spend the network into pure chaos. By your fallacious, Aristotelian-deprived reasoning, the fact that the NSA/GCHQ/CIA/et. al. have not done this is evidence that bitcoin is their creation. Such a statement would be just as fallacious.

More likely GCHQ than NSA, as he formerly worked for a GCHQ subcontractor, QuinetiQ:
Then again, it's incredibly difficult to parse who these various "Cyber Industrial Complex" firms are working for at any given time, especially when one considers the history of GCHQ helping to set up NSA/American cryptography during World War II. The ["Five Eyes" nations]( and the alphabet soup agencies that comprise them are more akin to a single decentralized cabal than individual actors.
And though most don't like to admit how problematic Hearn's former Google connections are, the history is undeniable: Google got "off its feet" with In-Q-Tel (the CIA's "venture capital" firm) cash and has acquired a number of former DoD/In-Q-Tel projects, with Keyhole (now Google Maps/Earth, which Hearn was intimately involved with) being the most prominent:
Honestly, it flabbergasts me that more people didn't see what Amir did; it was staring them right in the damn face. Glad we're all more or less on the same page at this point, but all of this could've been avoided if there were more discerning (some might even say "conspiratorial") minds within the bitcoin community.
It's time for people to accept that bitcoin is itself a conspiracy against banks and intelligence firms. We conspire more or less openly, but it's a conspiracy nonetheless.

There's just not enough places to exchange coins directly for goods and services to call Mycelium a "checking account." I get what you're saying vis a vis a "spending" versus a "saving" wallet, but Coinbase operates an actual "checking account" service for bitcoin, complete with debit card: 
So they're a checking account in the sense that they operate within the traditional banking sphere. I agree that they've been tremendously convenient for this use case, but they're still scumbags.
Then again, Coinbase required a slave-issued ID from me the moment I signed up, and Western Union (though not MoneyGram) has banned me from their service due to "suspect transfers." The only thing I've ever used them for was on LBC. So it's either pay a crazy premium from a local Mycelium dealer or deal with all this KyC BS from Coinbase/Circle/etc. for me. 
The problem ain't necessarily these traditional banking interfaces as much as it is bitcoin's sheer lack of liquidity in the marketplace as a whole. None of this stops until there's a virile ecosystem for BTC that operates completely divorced from fiat, 'cause these draconian "capital control" laws certainly aren't changin' anytime soon.

This has little to do with the underlying ideology and everything to do with the fact that Berwick is a criminal - conning people for "fast access" passports that didn't exist and swindling cash from investors in a Chilean land development project are just two such documented examples.

Gavin seems like a nice guy who's got the best for bitcoin in his heart - and in that sense, he's more than capable of speaking for himself vis a vis his supposed "connections" to the Security Industrial Complex, and I'll take him at his word when he says he has no affiliation with them.
Hearn, however, does. That's not a "conspiracy theory," Gavin, it's a documented fact, and you won't touch it with a ten-foot pole, probably because it's impossible for you to distance yourself from it at this point. That, to me, is far more perturbing than any proposed changes offered by Classic - the fact that one of the lead developers on "new bitcoin" couldn't sniff out the Security State operative right under his nose and still refuses to accept that this was the case.
