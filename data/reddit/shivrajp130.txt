Don't sell, transfer to a good wallet and HODL
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:21:03
Only idea is sell now and buy the dip so that I can have more bitcoins because I don't have more money to buy now, I have put all my money
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:21:17
Same to you

When Bitcoin price was $7500 at that time here it was $7900 and when it dropped to $6500 here it was $7200 but now it's again at $7645 even though Bitcoin is trading at $6500 in international market it means high demand in India right now, more people want to invest in bitcoin. But Im looking at correction to $5000/BTC

See now bro, price is at $4.25k now, I didn't loose any money. I'm in profit now. So buy every dip &amp; HODL ��.

He met govt officials I'm sure he has suggested to ban bitcoin in India because he came here at this time, because India is closely looking at crypto currencies these days &amp; govt is about to come up with some decision.
