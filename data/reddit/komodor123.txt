The node, Bitcoin Core provides when running, is not the same as a lightning node.

So your short position was closed and your BTC balance is also 0?
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:43:18
Did it work?
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:33:49
So you got margin calls? Did the position continue to move against you? If so, and you did not fund your account with additional assets, the liquidation is no surprise to me.
EDIT 1: At least if the 450 BTC deposited at Bitfinex did not count towards your margin, it is no surprise to me.
EDIT 2: I assume your 450 BTC simply did not count towards your margin. Probably only USD are accepted. Which would imply that the Bitfinex guys really do not know what they are talking about.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:47:13
Yeah sorry. OP is not 100% clear on this one, but after reading his other comments, it seems like only his short position (his trade) was liquidated.
Meaning: His 450 BTC are still there.

Warren Buffet ist not a "trader", he is a investor. Big difference.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:37:05
You obviously do not know what you are talking about.
@_date: 2018-01-27 09:25:54
This shows nothing.
Given the information provided, you can only tell that at the moment (!) more leveraged funds are bullish than bearish, assuming that open market positions are a useful indicator for this.
Everything else is speculation.
Getting sick of all this “Wall Street is manipulating everything” on this reddit.
EDIT: Also, this is NO USEFUL INDICATOR for the short-term or long-term price.

So I if I everybody thinks that that 9/11 was an inside job, it will become an inside job through self fulfilling prophecy?
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:48:34
No one can answer this question. Some will try for sure, but let this be said: No one can forsee the future. And anticipating market movement is almost impossible.
Thus, the best strategy is usually just doing nothing. HODL on!
However, it is ultimately your choice to make. But there are probably enough people at reddit, who can tell you amazing storys about how much money they lost by trying to trade BTC or other Alts.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:22:38
"sell order"? wtf you talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:31:41
Thanks for nothing.

@_date: 2017-12-11 18:33:07
Lol, this is not the solution.
Blocks are simply full (
Transaction costs are not rising because BTC price is rising, but because blocks are full. There are currently more transactions per minute than Bitcoin can handle, filling the mem pool.
This creates an incentive to increase the fee for my transaction in order to get it included into a block as soon as possible (or at all). Thus, limited supply (Block size, which limits the max. number of transactions within the Bitcoin network) and increasing demand (More users trying to send BTC across the network), are the reasons for increasing fees.
Removing any hard-coded fees will change nothing in this regard.

No sense in putting work into something, when you cannot be sure that it ever gets relevant. Before the New York Agreement SegWit seemed like months or even years away from activation.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:36:31
You do realize that SegWit was activated only a few months ago? And implementing SegWit on such a large scale takes time.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:00:27
Yeah, there are many inaccuracies and some things that are even wrong in OP’s post. Sadly, not the first time that someone who lacks the necessary knowledge, tries to explain something. Nothing worse than teaching “wrong” stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:33:17
Did you ever take a look at the mem pool?
Overbidding is not the issue.
This is like saying: "Oh, well, my car ony has a 1L tank, but the solution for my range problem is driving more fuel-efficient." Yes, it can improve the situation, but it will never solve the underlying problem.
@_date: 2018-10-16 21:35:11
Thank you very much! :)

AFAIK btcinformation.org was started as a response to bitcoin.org being sponsored. This is not the case anymore.
And the content on btcinformation.org is actually pulled from bitcoin.org.
Anyway, it can never hurt to have an backup :)
@_date: 2018-10-16 21:36:04
If you make it through the developer documentation I will be impressed :)
@_date: 2018-10-16 23:48:27
Without going to much into detail:
I don't know where this number comes from.
The Paxful Sponsorship was for 20k per month if I recall corrrectly. The sponsorship ran only 3 months.
I can not provide you with a breakdown since I am not involved in finances of bitcoin.org (You could open an Issue on this on GitHub and ask), but since I helped contacting volunteers regarding rewards I can tell you that it was a decent amount that was not limited by hesitations to reward people but actually by the amount of translation work during the summer that was eligible for rewards (E.g. no sense in paying 2 USD per translated word just to deplete all funds). Apart from that we want to continue using those fund to reward people (like it says in the post).
@_date: 2018-10-16 23:34:04
Can't disagree. However, I can't comment on Paxful itself.
But I am pretty sure everyone learned from this. And in the end the temporary sponsorship at least allowed bitcoin.org to reward translators :)
@_date: 2018-10-16 19:36:26
[Bitcoin.org]( currently relies solely on donations.  
Yes, for a short amount of time, [Bitcoin.org]( was sponsored by Paxful, but due to lack of community-support, the sponsorship was not renewed ([ However, thanks to this sponsorship, [bitcoin.org]( was able to reward volunteers that helped during the summer ([  
I hope this helped to clarify a few things.
@_date: 2018-10-17 00:02:00
Well, again I can not talk about Paxful, but the regular information regarding buying Bitcoin was still displayed on the website, just below the sponsored content.
Agreed, having another source of information can only be good ;) 
@_date: 2018-10-16 23:53:00
I understand. Like I mentioned in my post, I do not agree with certain opinions by cobra.
But so far, Cobra's actions did not have any direct impact on the informational content on bitcoin.org. And bitcoin.org is far to important to just let it rot.
@_date: 2018-10-16 21:43:14


Hey, that is great news! You want to do the Pull Request yourself on GitHub?  
Regarding the translations: Yeah, the HU translation (like many others) definitely needs a update :) Are you fine with the provided guidelines on how to get started? Otherwise just contact me directly :)
@_date: 2018-06-23 14:00:14
Yeah great, You only have to get your USD from Yobit to Kraken.
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:17:54
This post is garbage. OP is explaining options, not futures and the idea is not "basically the same". For example, there exist Options on Futures. Obviously it cannot be the same.
A Option is simply a option. You can do something or not, thus you pay a option premium. Futures are future contracts you are obliged to. There is no option, you have to fulfill your contract.
Futures do not have a strike price.
Forget this post, it is bullshit and has nothing to do with what CME will offer.
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:59:49
Sorry for the late reply:
Look at this video, it provides some good basics about futures:
Regarding Bitcoins, BTC futures at CME are cash settled. Means, you do not get BTC at settlement date, but an equivalent amount of money. Therefore, those futures can mainly be used for speculation. But they are also interesting for persons, who do not want to get involved directly into Bitcoin (setting up a wallet etc.) but still want to benefit from price swings.
I hope this satisfactory. If not, just write me :)
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:24:15
Thanks! Sorry for my harsh words, but nothing worse than spreading "wrong" knowledge, even with the best intentions :)
@_date: 2019-05-03 17:38:13
Great stuff! Appreciate it!
@_date: 2019-05-04 17:50:53
Best answer so far. This will definitely reduce the amount of work i need to put into this��
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:10:09
Thank you for flagging this.
@_date: 2019-05-03 17:37:58
Hhaah thank you :) I knew that someone would address scarcity. I will take a look at it :)
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:13:33
Puhh, this is A LOOOOT of stuff. thank you!
Very interesting...Seems like it is way easier to get comprehensive stuff on Bitcoin for free than on any listed company.
