I pretty irrelevant I can get good mythical e in like 1 month or two pretty easy I'd say but people are actually looking for vanity like titles like that the mise Grand Crusader a lots of feats of strength that you can contain any more that is what makes a good account. You check the black markets for WoW accounts you could see mythically geared ones for probably 500 maybe

@_date: 2015-06-19 23:12:42
 You had this?
All in all, thats all good, but this is the wrong subreddit to post for bitcoins, and with such a small amount of people who possess bitcoins, I think it will be quite hard for you to sell your account, is the place to post too by the way.
@_date: 2014-12-12 14:22:15
Demands been higher than ever I feel, record breaking transactions per block and days too.
@_date: 2014-08-29 02:46:44
I do recall someone trying to access my bank account recently :/
@_date: 2014-12-07 22:48:29
Mt.. oh.
@_date: 2015-05-25 01:40:14
No, sorry, never used them in my life.
@_date: 2015-05-01 19:28:46
What am I looking at right now, what does this image explain?
@_date: 2015-05-25 01:30:50
Im not quite sure, 2 weeks is a bit long, a month us where i would start panicing though.
@_date: 2015-05-15 20:36:47
Wow i hope they dont do this to me, how many coins did you purchase?
@_date: 2015-05-03 06:17:37
thank you
@_date: 2015-05-04 03:17:27
Wow, that isn't reassuring at all to hear. 
Why do you say they'd be the only ones who are able to finance a running node?
@_date: 2015-05-04 02:47:46
Thanks, this will enable many more transactions per second than we were able to do currently right?
We need more core developers for BTC...
@_date: 2015-05-03 06:02:59
Today I saw an old post where someone tipped someone 100 bitcoins, which is worth 20k now, must have been very minuscule back then
@_date: 2015-05-06 05:39:11
Well your post title made me curious, sorry I understand you have a product you're trying to push to the bitcoin community but the way you did it was a little clickbait-y, I mean I am interested too but shiet, i'm not really interested in taking your bitcoin.
I'll just lurk for now.

This should be upvoted and made aware, a thats unfortunate that this happened to you, appreciate the PSA about cloud bet. How shoddy

How long have you been trading, and since when?
@_date: 2015-05-04 17:10:52
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:35:35
You're appealing to the wrong market haha, I've been accepting bitcoins too :)
@_date: 2015-08-04 18:49:53
Strange, I sent some coins and its been over an hour with 0 confirmations?
@_date: 2015-08-04 21:51:32
No clue, my whole wallet is now unconfirmed, I sent 3 payments and the last one I set the fees to max..
for reference... I'm sort of panicking now.
@_date: 2015-07-29 21:16:34

First 500 is immediately available
@_date: 2015-07-08 14:24:05
haha, I actually enjoyed it, I had no idea what I was going in to, it was pretty funny and the bitcoin and darknet feature was hilarious too.
@_date: 2015-07-12 22:58:26
I remember Bear Whale, I'm still trying to understand though, why was a "wall" made at around 300 if he was trying to sell 30000? Would people try to undercut him and sell for less?
@_date: 2015-07-03 17:43:55
Of course it was a pump and dump
@_date: 2015-07-11 01:31:55
This seems interesting
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:53:03
I jad one for about a week, resold the shoddy thing right after for like 400... do not touch

I like how this came out the day after their competitor was released!
@_date: 2015-04-11 17:50:25
I'm trying to figure that out too.

Not quite sure, i'm a little confused as why demand is low..

OP deserves a whipping 
@_date: 2015-04-10 15:59:27
Thats pretty interesting i've never seen this before, the map shows places where the transactions are happening from? 
Does it know location?
@_date: 2015-04-12 15:36:53
Isn't this just plain old news?
