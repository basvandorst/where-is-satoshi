Sorry for the misinterpretation (in the video), we don't use Public keys, but wallet addresses. The key thing is an error and the website has already been adjusted and a new movie is made.   
For the 1 stop address: FIO is already working on something like this, and we will implement it once that goes online. However, not everyone wants this (like the die-hards with the original idea of anonymity) and therefore we think this is the solution for everyone that wants to send a request.

1. You as in the website or you as in person?
   1. Website, no, as we don't safe anything, so the hacker would have to know what's happening at the spot.
   2. person, sure, but that can happen anytime, everywhere
2. Of course, but we aren't. (how am i going to prove that? I can't, but hope this reaction will do its part).  
3. Always a risk, but we're upscaling as soon as we see an error. So sure, but not really a serious thread, is it?
4. This will be handled in wallet, and not through us as we're only the connector. So yes, sure, but would be your wallets error.
  
We're still in beta, and trying to get a new, better, payment method in place. Thanks for your remarks! We're hoping to adjust every one of them to make a better payment system for everyone to use!

Public key was a misinterpretation that is been worked on (you have to use your wallet address).   
Sorry for that. Never give away your public or private key! I fully support this

We have an opening in our marketing team. You seem to fit in perfectly, want the (blow)job?

aah xD

That you can pay more easily of course. Pay by click on an URL.  We don't save anything, and everything is handled by the wallets themselves internally, so other than a DDOS on the website, and the service being down temporarily, there are no risks.

they are still there, but we think this is an easier option.

Selling my kidney, still have another one

We're thinking of that but the maker of the request knows his address obviously.  But it will be implemented some time soon one way or another :).

You should try  [ . the other party can send you a request, and everything is already filled out for you in one of the supported wallets. They are increasing the support over time.

No, but Linda will be under your desk :)
