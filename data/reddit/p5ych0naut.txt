what makes it so revolutionary?
1)  Now that we have tor, VPNs, and dual-key encryption, and that using them is becoming commonplace and easy for anyone to understand and use, people can use the Internet and technology to make anonymous payments.  There is a base of people who very much value the ability to pay for things anonymously.
2)  Due to its structure, there is a finite number of bitcoins that can, or will, every exist. 
3)  Since some bitcoins will invariably be seized by governments, stolen, or forgotten in encrypted wallets, the overall amount of bitcoins will DECREASE over time, making bitcoin a deflationary currency, and increasing the value of all the bitcoins that are left.
4)  It is the first cryptocurrency, as well as the one that is most used, which gives it more credibility than all the other cryptocurrencies that have popped up over the past few years.
5)  It uses SHA-256 proof-of-work algorythm, as opposed to scrypt proof-of-work algorythms, like cryptocurrencies with smaller block chains, which makes bitcoins harder to mine, giving them a higher value.
6)  It uses a p2p protocol for logging payment transactions.
These six things, in combination, are what make bitcoins revolutionary.  Because, prior to bitcoin, if u wanted to pay for something without using cash you were dependent on the need of that person for something you have.  i.e. if you told your landlord, "I don't have cash, but I'll give you my PS4 in place of this month's rent payment," you were dependent on his need of a PS4 (or whatever else you have) to accept it as payment.
But now there are these things called "bitcoins" which are cryptographic expressions (expensive math problems) that both cost money to produce (electricity, mining rigs, upgrades), giving them intrinsic value, and which only one person can hold at a time (due to the P2P protocol, meaning if anyone copied your bitcoin, it wouldn't matter, because the protocol would still say you owned it.  or if they manage to steal it, they still can't spend it, because stolen bitcoins can be reported and tracked on the network).  Now your landlord doesn't need to take your PS4, he can just accept bitcoins, because surely there is something HE wants that someone is willing to sell him in exchange for bitcoins, or, at the very least, he can sell his bitcoins to an exchange for fiat currency.
As long as the P2P network stays intact, Internet anonymization is legal, and there is someone out there who finds value in using bitcoins, every bitcoin will hold SOME value.  THAT is what makes bitcoin revolutionary.

Well, if I understand correctly, if a pool has 51% of the total overall mining power, they have the most efficient total mining power and have priority over the confirmation of finished blocks.  This can allow the pool mods to do a number of things that damage the integrity of the block chain, like redirecting the rewards for completed blocks, falsifying transactions, preventing transactions, etc.
Is that what it is?

my bad. I don't actually know, I asked others in the CEX.io chat and they said "DDOS'd."  During the entire time, (~12-6 PST) the website was inaccessible, and the stratum for the us, uk, and netherlands were all dead.  This happened literally hours after ghash crossed the 51% threshold.
the real question is: was this a true DDOS, (I mean, performed by a third party), or is it ghash sys admins doing some sort of DDOS false flag? all the articles warning of ghash's 51% takeover warned that it would be those sys admins that had the most motives, means, and opportunity to carry out an attack.
has anyone experienced any missing shares, or lost any transactions?
@_date: 2014-06-16 19:50:39
what about distributed pooling, the situation ghash is trying to push?
@_date: 2014-06-16 19:52:50
well shit, it was for me. I'm running bfgminer and all the stratums were listed as dead for hours.  I tried restarting and everything, to no avail.

I'm still mining at ghash, because none of the other pools can match the same mining speed. eligius comes close, but when I mine in a BTCGuild pool my real speed (accounting for lost, orphaned, rejected shares) is less than 25% of the speed of ghash.  also, if they do ever perform a 51% attack, you want to be on the 51% side, not the 49% side.  If they do fuck people over its less likely they'll fuck their own pool members over and more likely they'll fuck the other pools over, right?

I was reading bitcoin news all the time during the periods you mention.  The 51% attack represented less than 2% of the hundreds of articles I read, and none of them were framed as, "be careful which pool you join."  I'm sure there were lots of people who've been talking about this for a long time, but until recently, this wasn't mainstream bitcoin news.  If I searched "bitcoin" and "mining pools" on google news in December and January, "51% attack" would not have been in the first couple pages of results.  As of now, and a few weeks ago, they are some of the first stories to pop up for those searches.

maybe you guys should have done a better job explaining **why** other miners should have avoided ghash.  when I started mining, just this month, I looked around for what pool was the best to join, large, medium, or small?  the only response I got was: "it doesn't matter, your income all evens out in the end. the only difference is that large pools are more likely to submit a block first, i.e. small pools are more likely to get stale or rejected shares.
not once did I hear the "51% attack" as a response to **that question**.  Not until this last week did that become a real issue, and receive wide attention in the bitcoin community.
yes, the 51% attack was something I read about, but most articles treated it as "a potential problem for the distant future."  Seriously, not one word from the community about, "Whatever you do, don't join ghash!"
Had I received that warning, I would have joined BTCGuild, or eligius, or something.

a lot of the things you listed there can't really happen.
1) if its outlawed, what's to stop people from using it? we can transfer coinz anonymously by using the Tor service, VPNs, encryption, and no one would know.
2) how is it not "safe"? what is an "unsafe" currency?
3) its highly likely that there will always be merchants accepting bitcoins.
4) what is meant by "over regulated"? how could it be regulated? its a decentralized currency.
5) 51% takeover wouldn't matter, because if it really presented a problem with the currency (people trying to fuck up the value), the bitcoin community could respond by identifying the bitcoins on the blockchain that were bought by that user(s) and urging merchants and users not to accept them.  that would decrease the supply of bitcoin and increase their value.
6) altcoins are just that, ALTERNATE.  they differ in their proof-of-work-concept, their market caps, their total supply... for many reasons, Bitcoin would continue to be the best SHA-256 based cryptocurrency, even if another SHA-256 cryptocurrency popped up.
7) "replaced by Fed." the Federal Reserve cannot regulate cryptocurrencies, they have no way to do that.  period.
8) "Created by NSA."  This is the only thing I see here that could potentially be an issue.  If it is revealed that the NSA was behind the creation of Bitcoin it could seriously undermine its credibility.
Hope that helped.  Thanks for listening to my rant.

hey stupid: when the price is low, you take the opportunity and BUY BITCOINS from people freaking out and offloading them at stupid-low prices! have you never heard, "buy low, sell high"? 
sure, mining bitcoins may not feel as profitable right now as it did a few days ago, but if you actually have any long term interest in bitcoin you should partake in trading... buy bitcoins! 
furthermore, part of the reason ghash took such a large percent of the market was because they partnered with the bitcoin commodities exchange (CEX.io) and allowed people to buy mining power by the GH/s.  So you have the ability to mine, then use your mined bitcoins to buy more mining power, which produces more bitcoins, which buys more mining power, etc, etc, etc.  Combining those two things (a mining pool and a GHS exchange) through one site is an extremely efficient and desirable platform.

to clarify, I'm not really angry at CEX. I know that they're just trying to survive as a new type of business, like every other crypto-currency mining company, in an environment that is quickly becoming regulated by governments. But since CEX has been around for a significant amount of time, retains a significant percentage of the overall mining power in the world, and is capable of processing tens or hundreds of thousands of transactions every day, they are the ones, I think, who need to be pushed the most, to fight for the change we all deserve: the right to anonymously mine, own, and trade crypto-currencies.

yeah, as long as he cashes his bitcoins out on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, he doesn't risk losing much if bitcoin drops in price.  but if he's looking for bitcoin as an investment, I wouldn't recommend betting his business against it.  bitcoin is still very new, many of the people investing don't understand how it holds value, what its "backed by" (answer: the availability of the internet), and thus, gauging if it will "take off" or tank is exceedingly difficult.

if they have his wallet its only a matter of time before they decrypt it. no encryption is completely invulnerable to attack/crack

price goes up, bc the gov't is either 
a) not going to use them, making them rare (decrease in supply) and increase in value
b) going to use them, giving them credibility that they did not have before, which would increase their demand and thus, increasae in price.
