The story i’m about to tell you is about my close friend John and his way with cryptocurrencies. I’m not a writer, and basically i’ve never wrote anything like this, so i will try just to give you guys fact’s.
Everything started in 2012, when John met me at my house and told about some strange digital currency called ‘Bitcoin’.I heard about it before and it has never sounded very promising to me,but John explained that this asset have really great potential and range of growth.After some time of googling, i also decided to invest in this “risky thing”.
In 2013 Bitcoin was around 100$ worth and John continued holding and investing in this asset, despite overall profit he had at that time.But then Mt.Gox bankruptcy happened and he lost nearly 95&amp; of his investment, which was around 100.000$ at that time.
The man, who have never seen those amount of money in his live, and kept all his Bitcoin’s for daughters education and house, now was with almost nothing.
Creditors \- I don’t know who they were, but i totally knew that common bank wouldn’t gave him 100.000$ to invest in god knows what. And so he started again and gained pretty good money during the period from 2015 to the end of 2017.
At 28’th of December 2017 he got in car accident. He broke the ridge at several places, and remained in induced coma for around 1.5 month. When he got an abilitty to speak again, he gave me the account login info, to check on his money and orders.I’ve already knew that after that epic correction, there won’t be much. When i got home and logged in, i saw only 10 btc left at his account. His long order from 10.000$ got liqudated resulting in giant loss.
Half of bitcoins left were spent on medical bills. As far as I understood,the other part was also lost after some time.
After what happened i was trying to talk to him, help him somehow, but those events completely broke him. Jonh’s wife told me that the loan for 100.000$ was still unpaid and some strange guys were trying to reach them lately.
One week ago John was found beaten up badly. He died in hospital a day later.
I believe, that this story will be heard, and some of you guys will learn from his mistakes.
If you want to help his family survive during those hard times, write down below. Thank you.
