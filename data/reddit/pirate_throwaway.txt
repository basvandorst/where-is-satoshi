First I thought about starting a passthrough to get &gt;25k btc and maintain my 7%, but then I realized that it's too much trouble just for an additional 2%. Ultimately, it's his business so he can decide what he pays. The only thing I expected was to get my money back when it ended so yeah, I'm disappointed with that, but we'll see what happens...

I'm not talking about invite only. I'm talking about limiting deposits. During the first 8 months, pirate only accepted deposits up to X bitcoins. If you sent more than that, the coins would come back to you. Of course that you can say that he did that to make it look like it isn't a ponzi....

Really? Say that some guy comes to you and says: here, I'll give you $100K in cash if you send $95K worth of bitcoins to this address in the other side of the world. Here is an opportunity to earn 5% for doing something that apparently is not illegal. You don't know where the money comes from and you don't know where the bitcoins go. You just need to trade bitcoins for cash without asking any questions and you will earn your share.
The key here is that pirate has big customers. Everybody in IRC knew that long before this whole story started.

I invested with pirate very early 2012 and I withdrew more than enough to cover my initial investment a few months ago. The remaining money in the account is still with pirate. I invested (and earned) much more than 500btc. I never operated a public pass through. Ask me stuff.

I don't know if this was for me, but I'll give you my answer: no, I won't because I didn't lose any money. Also, I don't live in the US (people don't sue everybody all the time in other countries).

Sorry, but I really don't have a better camera right now:  Regarding the stealing from other investors, no one knows for sure what pirate was doing. I am as curious as you and we can speculate a lot. Of course that I have my personal opinion and I do not believe it was a ponzi. Maybe I should add that I traded with pirate sometime before he started doing this in November 2011. edit:grammar

The amount depends on how many customers you have and how much ~~drug they sell~~ money they make. Don't you find it strange that pirate limited deposits until he met new customers? I have never seen a ponzi limiting deposits, but who knows...

I'm not going to disclose amounts. I withdrew my initial investment, but I do have most of my profits still with pirate. In dollars it's a lot more than what I invested initially that because the btc price was low when I bought.

5% for &gt;5K,  6% for &gt;15K and 7% for &gt;25K. But these rates never became a reality. Pirate ended it before the transition

Well, no I don't know details because I never did anything like that and I don't known anyone who has ever done something like that. But pirate never claimed unlimited growth. Like I said earlier, pirate limited the deposits until he "found new customers to trade with" like he used to say. If the limit was reached and someone deposited, the coins were sent back to the depositor. When this thing started you couldn't deposit more than a few hundred coins with pirate because he wouldn't accept the money. So, if you consider that there is a limit I don't see why drugs can't fit the description. You can start small with one or two customers moving 10K or 20K a week and escalate to a more people who move around a lot more money. Why do you think that it is unlikely? $1 million a week in drugs is too much?
@_date: 2012-09-03 10:05:09
Well, I'm not counting on that money anymore, but it is not up to me to decide where the money goes (if there's any left). We'll need to see what pirate has to say about this.

So, you can't think of ways to get 10% return every week? I can think of many, but most of them aren't exactly "good". I won't say "legal" because there isn't a single law regarding bitcoins in any country. Without laws you can easily profit a lot from "legal" thigs.
@_date: 2012-09-04 10:27:59
You've got a point. It's a lot of money. It is easy to find examples of operations earning 10% a week, but not with that volume. Even people at bitcoin-otc make 10% a week. I know many traders there earning money by regularly selling at MtGox+5% and buying at MtGox-5%. The problem here is that they don't move $1 million a week. In the beginning when pirate's availability was nearly 0 and you couldn't deposit for several weeks straight, this theory made much more sense.
@_date: 2012-09-02 07:37:45
I earned around 10% overall which is much less than the 7% per week, but, honestly, it's completely free money so why complain? People are getting nuts all over this and most of them didn't even throw a penny in there... Anyway, I still believe that pirate will return at least a part of my profits. For those who asked for a range: I have more than 5K btc currently deposited.
