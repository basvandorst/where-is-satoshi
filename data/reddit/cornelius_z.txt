I think the post is about the gentleman holding a Bitcoin branded bag. I don’t think he’s trying to intentionally humiliate them. He’s one of us.
@_date: 2019-07-26 21:31:46
It’s advertising a company, they do this sort of thing weekly.
@_date: 2019-07-08 18:31:35
No it isn’t? it’s “lol @ the bag holder” the guy, holding the Bitcoin bag, and implying he owns Bitcoin ‘bags’
@_date: 2018-08-06 08:17:16
Kinda misleading. This is a fiat to fiat transaction using bitcoin as a medium. Not a bitcoin transaction, which is very easy and simple.
Most people are looking to the future when they reference the original image. 'After Bitcoin' adoption, that we would live in a world where we use Bitcoin for everyday transactions between people. Earning bitcoin, sending bitcoin overseas and that person spending the bitcoin.
No one here is being thoughtless, they know that currently fiat is pegged to bitcoin and that we're still using fiat currency to buy and sell bitcoin. But many of us have had a taste of what it feels like to earn bitcoin, send bitcoin and have full control of our own personal bank account. As more adoption &amp; services grow, so will our freedom from fiat banks/services.

Could you?
In the U.K. if you wanted to avoid the stupidly high price doing instant buys. You had to do a SEPA transfer that would usually cost between £11-£15 each time. 
Now you can use coinbase pro to add buy/sell orders at your own chosen price, without any bank fees after depositing using their new method.

Some people are way to defensive all the time. It was a good question and the answer although kinda obvious, was interesting to read, so thanks! 
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:11:54
It's really sad to see people pretend to 'know' whilst insulting others.
No one knows what's going to happen next, especially you.

I thought if withdrawals had resumed on Mt.Gox, we would get a much cheaper price as 90-100$ coins flood the market...The price wouldn't go up at first. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:15:29
Man, I love that red T-shirt with the white Bit-Coin logo. Anyone know where it's from?
@_date: 2014-04-10 06:10:49
Same here. Very confused for a moment.

I'm a videographer. Ignore the troll comment. Its a prize, not payment. And in that regard I would be thrilled to win some BTC. I freelance and I've even thought of accepting btc for that.
@_date: 2014-03-13 13:55:29
Loved the Starbucks logo.
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:59:09
Went there yesterday. Paid for my coffee with Bitcoins and then bought some at the ATM. It was a very pleasant experience.
@_date: 2019-03-20 08:28:51
From a comment in another thread (someone from Venezuela) he answered that during the black out, phone networks were still up.
It’s a hard one, because on one hand bitcoin isn’t designed for a place with no electricity. But the reality is that A LOT of people have generators &amp; phones.  
@_date: 2019-03-02 11:15:23
Wow... this has nothing to do with SJW’s
Bitcoins literal fundamentals are Control, Privacy, Decentralisation and libertarian views. The 2008 crash is what spurred its creation.
Who would have thought people who believe in the above DON’T like them hiring a known unethical group who’s livelihoods have been to create tools to monitor and track citizens...
Our industry isn’t being destroyed by SJW’s...
These views have been engraved into the community since the start. 
@_date: 2019-03-02 13:06:40
It’s a joke. Something someone once said about lightning being an altcoin. They’re poking fun at it. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 14:54:32
I’m glad!
I’ve been to Caracas and really enjoyed my stay. I wish you all the best and I hope you stay safe. Maybe Bitcoin will help in some way in your country in the future! 
@_date: 2019-03-05 10:38:06
Amazing to hear. Glad you got it sorted 
@_date: 2019-03-16 15:22:53
My first ever bitcoin purchase was a coffee in Central London in 2014. - good times... although most expensive coffee I ever bought. I have a picture of it somewhere. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 10:45:21
Just quoting what a Venezuelan Redditor said in another bitcoin thread yesterday. I do not doubt for a second that bitcoin isn’t that’s useful in a place without electricity.  But I wasn’t talking about my opinion.
Are you Venezuelan? I went many years ago, beautiful country. But perhaps my views of the country are through rose tinted glasses.
@_date: 2018-06-05 12:25:48
A fair bit, not as much as I’d like or others. Purchasing coffee as far back as 2014. friends, paying them what I owe in bitcoin rather than fiat, that’s always nice. 
I still wouldn’t consider it an investment over a ‘savings’ which is how I treat mine. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 08:15:07
New investors... Damn this sub has changed if that's what we care about here now.
@_date: 2018-06-05 08:45:48
Fair enough &amp; I agree, about the class system part. It's about choices right. Some people will want to be coinbase users, others will want cold wallets and independence. Options are great. 
I just hope the 'investors' don't outweigh the 'users' in this sub just yet. I'm here for tech not money. 
@_date: 2019-08-14 18:06:16
Revolut is a bank, like Monzo. So I buy Bitcoin doing bank transfer from Monzo, should be the same. Very easy too!
@_date: 2019-10-15 18:22:28
You can move bitcoin for cheaper than $4.
@_date: 2019-02-03 22:15:29
Owned by coinbase, so although it’s still a data buying operation. Much safer than you trying to find mining apps for iPhone.
@_date: 2019-02-03 22:18:49
Try buying small amounts too if you’re interested in owning some Bitcoin.
If you’re in the U.K. I use Vimba to buy small amounts every week. 
Much safer than harming your gadgets.  There’s a lot of scams and malicious software out there, so be careful. 
@_date: 2019-06-09 15:57:36
That’s awesome, great to see so many contributors.
@_date: 2019-02-03 21:44:35
Best bet is to sign up to earn and fill in their surveys and give over an email / telegram account to ICO's.
you get 1$ of bitcoin for each sign up.
Their very much buying your data though, be aware of that before you do anything.
@_date: 2019-02-20 10:48:31
using the term 'lucky' is a tacky way to dismiss peoples success. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 08:49:51
What are you on about? 
The mempool hasn’t been full for over a year (when it was attacked.) and batching, segwit and lightning have been growing organically.
Bitcoin isn’t near its transaction limit and isn’t ok the verge of complete failure you baboon. 
@_date: 2019-12-18 08:16:45
You ok mate?
@_date: 2019-02-10 11:54:23
This guy is a real threat to the network, it's possible he will take all 21 billion bitcoins and become the CEO of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-20 07:40:49
Yup! Like you, that coffee purchase was really exciting at the time and I think cemented my obsession with Bitcoin.
Now days, I try to use Bitcoin to transact between friends. If I owe someone a tenner, I’ll ask them if they want it in Bitcoin etc.
@_date: 2019-04-20 07:24:18
The first time I actually purchased something that wasn’t on the internet.
A coffee in 2014, London. I haven’t checked in a while, but it was about £70 last time I looked. Not that painful, but a very pricey flat white.
@_date: 2018-11-06 10:04:35
Another account that only posts articles from a website they own. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:27:00
Their finances aren’t my problem. Just providing some generic information on how to buy. Just found there was an increase in interest. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 13:43:43
Least I can sign more people up to Bitcoin once I’m in prison. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:25:20
Nah. Sent it all straight to my Trezor. Coinbase send the referral gift as BTC anyway. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:56:37
After crash. All within the last few 3 days or so. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:13:17
not sure what situation you’re in. But...
1. My friends and family would never ask for handouts. They would have already if that was a thing.
2. Their money isn’t my problem. I’d laugh with them if they lost it all &amp; none of them would care.
@_date: 2017-09-24 16:18:18
Calm down.
Don’t use coinbase myself. But recommend it to people who don’t have a clue because it’s very easy for them to buy in the UK. I also talk them through other websites, moving their coins. This isn’t about coinbase, it’s about how many people who weren’t interested who now are in my circle of friends.
If I told a friend he needs to scan his passport, bill, do a 3 day SEPA transfer that costs £15 all to buy some coins. They won’t do it... 
@_date: 2018-07-01 11:41:40
 I think one of my biggest concerns storing my key at home is fire &amp; flooding. I like this idea, but a physical key stamped/stored as metal is still your best bet.
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:22:39
It better be. Otherwise my mates are going to break my legs. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 11:52:29
Terrible photoshop job. (Some not all)

Hey fakers. Try again... I used Stylometry analysis to PROVE I am Satoshi....
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:07:37
Shame we don’t have better options currently.
I think Samourai wallet is still in development, but looking forward to that. 
I’d strongly recommend to stay away from BRD, I’ve not had a great experience with their wallet and their segwit support is lacking. 
@_date: 2019-05-28 07:39:08
Had an interesting moment at one recently. (although not entirely Bitcoin related) My colleague needed some Krona and walked over to ask how much he could get for  £400. 
The guy offered him an absolutely terrible price, and my friend whipped out google to point out how insane the commission was. Guy at the booth told him there was nothing he could do.
Colleague feet away, opened up his Revolut app (that lets you buy Bitcoin I believe?) Swapped £400 over to Krona and we walked on like it had never happened. The future of money is changing and these things will be obsolete.
@_date: 2019-05-20 19:23:12
So true. Big blockers don’t understand that Bitcoin is trying to stay decentralised, not stay small.
As storage drops in price and internet speeds become faster, a block increase is absolutely fine.
@_date: 2019-05-29 06:43:28
I’ve never actually used it, but two of my friends swear by it, especially when using aboard.
Any company like that which supports Bitcoin gets a thumbs up from me.
@_date: 2019-05-25 12:33:43
Proof? I keep hearing both sides of the story here, but only side actually links to (the empty mempool) genuinely curious to see.
@_date: 2019-05-05 13:04:32
Agreed. Supporting services that are fair &amp; open is so important in hopes they grow the same way coinbase did.
@_date: 2019-05-26 07:51:06
What wallet if you don’t mind me asking?
@_date: 2019-05-25 12:49:42
Yeah, I can see that. But proof that TV asked them to? Slush prioritised the transaction, but they’re free to do so if they please? 
I mean I get it, fair enough. But I don’t see this big conspiracy that people are getting heated up for. Slush just probably pushed that transaction after seeing the bet, and kinda ruined it for everyone. 
The 51% attack on BCH in the last 24 hours is way more interesting IMO.
@_date: 2019-05-05 07:49:36
Well if you own a private company it usually does give them that right.
But Bitcoin is a great because it gives us options. 
And even though think Milo is a cunt. Even people I disagree with can and should have complete control of their money.
I deleted coinbase a long time ago now. It’s not Bitcoin and doesn’t resemble anything like the Bitcoin we love. It’s a bank, and a bad one at that.
@_date: 2019-05-05 13:23:07
Not sure if I trust the government to do that though. 
Open source &amp; decentralised is the way I hope!
@_date: 2013-12-21 23:57:57
same for me.
