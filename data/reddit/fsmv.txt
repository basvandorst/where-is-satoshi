That's not possible, that's part of the hash. Only the transaction id can be changed.

They're probably using a payment processor which accepts the double spend risk for them.
However negligible that is; it has never happened before.

Sorry I don't mean to be argumentative, it's just that replying to you made a good place to see if others agree.
Thanks for the link

What change tip brings is the ability to send to anyone, regardless of whether they use bitcoin or not (which brings people into it) and regardless of whether they remembered to put their address in their post. It feels weird to put a donation address somewhere, people don't want to ask for money.
Now you can argue that evangelizing by giving people small amounts of bitcoin, which some people go as far as to call "money," is disingenuous but the overall sentiment here is that its a good way to get the word out. I don't see any huge problem with it.

I was going to say the same thing. Its like Valve's system with software support that could allow it to work on a much larger scale. Even the voting to make someone a contributor is a lot like Valve's hiring process.
@_date: 2014-11-18 01:02:03
This is different than a bounty though, this is a way to tip people for exceptional answers not a way to give money to get more people to spend time answering the question.

I only wish I lived in Colorado so I could vote for you. Which reminds me, I should check out who might deserve my support in Ohio.
In fact there should be a list of congressmen and candidates and their stances on key issues.

Coinbase is a broker not an exchange. They just do bulk orders on Bitstamp.

Windows 10, Firefox. It also looks like that on Android in reddit is fun. It is slightly better on my Arch Linux install with two actually separate lines but they're not centered.

Coinbase is not an exchange, they're a broker. If you want to speculate use an actual exchange that has a fiat money wallet they keep for you. Coinbase isn't holding up your money, the banking system is. ACH transfers take time.
@_date: 2013-07-12 00:48:44
Once you've verified they're willing to trust that the transfer will go through. You can tell them you want btc, they'll start the ACH transfer and send you the btc right there without waiting for the transfer to go through.
If it doesn't though, they have your identity and can fuck up your credit score. I wonder if following through improves your credit score with this.

Here's the non-mobile link

That can all be handled by a server. For example: Coinbase could get a number people can text, they can register their phone number with their account and, if needed, even addresses to pay to. Then they can send Coinbase a message saying "pay 1A8wFDVZbwiboaMzFVzdt9h1oaVHbVGrdE 0.1 BTC" and Coinbase can take care of the rest.
The important part for Kenya is making the entire thing accessible through text message, registration, accepting payment, adding funds, everything. Once someone does that it looks like Kenya would be able adopt bitcoin.

Yeah, you should even make the same amount of money mining solo in the long term. But instead of getting small payouts every day, you'd get the whole 25 btc at a time only a few times a year.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:20:06
Freenode suggests using  they use the single hash to denote official channels. I.e.  would be run by canonical not as an unofficial channel. Athough it probably doesn't really matter for such a temporary channel.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:11:59
Will someone be recording this? It seems like CSPAN doesn't let you listen to past radio broadcasts, only what appears on the TV channels.

On reddit, you do links like \[title\]( to get [title]( HTML isn't allowed, like on many other sites, for security reasons.
@_date: 2013-04-26 15:44:58
I find this hard to believe and your title doesn't help; it's just a list of buzz words.
Is there a website with more information somewhere?
edit: found it 
@_date: 2013-08-25 05:47:43
Thanks for the reply. I haven't seen a graph of blocks solved over time so I don't really have a place to stand when I make a claim like that. But from what I've been hearing I suspect the graph would be closer to exponential than linear.
I may have to try and find or make such a graph tomorrow.

If you're not going to load java on the premise that one can make a keylogger with it, you can't load any program that isn't open source, you've read through and understand completely, and you've compiled yourself with a compiler that you also understand completely and can guarantee adds no malicious code at compile time.
Using a computer requires trust. Be cautious, but sometimes there are programs you want to run and you don't have time to read through the source.

At least it went to charity; damn bot is too good at parsing things.
@_date: 2013-05-21 20:24:52
I was under the impression that there will never be a time when no bitcoins are created. It just lowers the number asymptotically so that the total never goes above 21M. Also that there will never actually be 21M just 20.999999M and that year 0.00000001M or some smaller number will be created. At that point 0.01 btc would be worth just as much as 50 btc is now and 0.01 btc as a reward for mining would still be worth it.

These sites could generate a new address for every viewer. That way you don't know all of their addresses and you can't add up how much money they have.

They're not 'spamming' we are. Humble bundle doesn't post these normal Reddit users do.

You can fix your numbers by writing 2\\. instead of just 2. below I've used 5. for the the list below.
5. test
5. test2
5\. This is after escaping the dot with \\
text written after it has to have an empty line between it and the line above though. Like this one has an empty line on either side of it.
199\. this too
Here's the [formatting guide](

They ACH transfer &lt;$1 into your account which takes about 3 days. After that shows up though you can tell them how much they transfered to verify as soon as you want.
@_date: 2013-06-16 21:12:55
It looks like they have 230 of those which means you'd make back the investment in less than a year at 1 ASIC per day.
@_date: 2013-05-15 18:13:21
Does it work when you put the $ on the wrong side?
@_date: 2013-04-04 05:12:10
They're not working with $30 jumps though.
I.e. you wouldn't need to colocate for this
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:40:24
Remember this? Forbes was reporting [the end of days]( when bitcoins went from $13.50 - $7.00. You will all be fine and so will your bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:34:05
Exactly, we all have experience with ACH transfers taking days. Someone could easily build a credit/escrow system on top of bitcoin and be that trusted third party like visa, mastercard and paypal are now. But the best part about bitcoin is that we don't need that.
@_date: 2013-04-20 20:32:54
Is [this]( not one button? Java isn't the only thing that is easy to run and use.
@_date: 2013-06-15 01:56:37
Right? Their page title is "Blank." I don't know how people expect to run a business with that as their front.

Open platforms are the only platforms which are secure. Without openness the platform requires you to trust the creator and the manufacturer.

That's assuming we continue to produce at the same rate we are now. That isn't the case though, hash power is increasing too fast for the difficulty to keep up even. We may end up at the next halving sooner than intended.

Aren't bitcoin miners people who like to be paid in bitcoin?
