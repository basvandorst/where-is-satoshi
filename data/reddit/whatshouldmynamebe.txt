I mean if he plans to hold onto what he has regardless an isn’t interested in buying more it wouldn’t really matter.

This is simultaneously the best and worst solution I’ve heard.

I’d love to know what you’re involved in to be asking this question. Someone won’t quit sending you bitcoin?

You are underestimating the importance of customer ATM access has been to banks historically. This is changing but ATM access was one of the most important factors in choosing a bank for consumers. Banks pay ATM companies, not the other way around. And as we’ve been discussing, customers also pay ATM companies. In both situations, this is set up as a per usage fee and not a “subscription” fee. 
The gas station analogy works. The only difference is that the gas station doesn’t care what your balance is so they don’t pay for the equipment to look at it. However they do have a credit card reader which exchanges information with your financial institutions via MasterCard, Visa, etc.

This isn’t that hard. When you use a 3rd party ATM there is a stated fee that the machine informs you of. That machine is charging you directly to use it. Your bank has nothing to do with that fee as it applies to all unaffiliated banks equally. 
Now, many banks will charge you a separate ATM fee after you use a 3rd party ATM. That money is used to pay their fees associated with allowing a 3rd party ATM to connect to their system. One could suppose that some banks charge extra and keep it. Many banks actually reimburse you for the initial ATM service charge as well as the bank fee that follows a few times each month. 
To summarize and be clear, the fee the ATM company charges you is no more affiliated with your bank than the gas station is when you use your bank card to purchase a pack of gum.

As a government employee, I resent being called a leech.

If the posts and comments on this subreddit are any indication, there are going to be a lot of really stupid rich people if Bitcoin reaches its potential future value.

20 percent is way too much no matter your investment but with 5000 in you need to let it sit and come back in a few years. No point in fucking with margins regardless at his stage. Might as well throw $1000 at a 4 team parlay in Bovada if you’re gonna do that.

Whatever you do, don’t start chasing those losses. Learn your lesson and leave margin trading to people with money to burn.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:29:44
Someone with that little money has no business margin trading.

Relax donkey. Everything is okay.

Seems like a lot of work to store .1 BTC

I don’t have any evidence that I’ll be alive in 20 minutes but I can still say that more likely than not I will be. And if your bitcoin isn’t on Coinbase, why is/was it stuck there?
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:27:01
You must be new. Coinbase crashes when bitcoin goes wild. You shouldn’t be storing the majority of bitcoin on any exchange but I’m confident the small amount I have there will be just fine.

There is a difference between protesting in the streets and potentially providing a negative interview for whatever international platform it might pop up on.

You’re asking them to do a job that their government would potentially kill or jail them for. I don’t blame them for not wanting to be recorded speaking openly about the state of things in Venezuela. They have no idea who you are or what you plan to do with those recordings. It’s probably not worth the $20 to take that kind of risk.
