Eventually, through the use of blockchain technology, we will probably be voting for and funding ideas with smart contracts instead of electing individuals and their flaws. Decentralized society.

I much prefer [Doffr]( Much like ChangeTip, but 3 clicks instead of all the typing.

I do not evangelize Bitcoin because it has the potential to bring me wealth. I evangelize Bitcoin because there is a much lower probability that it could suddenly impoverish me along with an entire working class nation in a banking crisis.

I much prefer [Doffr]( for monetizing digital content. It's much more of a B2C concept than the P2P of ChangeTip and therefore not 100% comparable.

$500 for a sweet TV? Pffft. Try $500 to pay for your data being held hostage by some sweet ransomware.

I'm a South African working in the FinTech space and I'm sure I would love WSJ if their draconian fee structure didn't block me every time I clicked on a link. I wish I could subscribe using Bitcoin. :'(

They could be referring to the Apple Terms and Conditions for their iOS app, right? We can't expect a support cowboy or his direct supervisor to know the nitty gritty legalities.

Easy! I use BitX ([Android]( / [iOS]( / [web]( because it looks fantastic. 
When I talk to noobs, I don't want a transaction history cluttered with wallet addresses and transactions IDs scaring them off.

Ask them for proof of mining hardware.
