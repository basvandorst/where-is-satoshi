Also, it's not like just cash is being passed around.  Loans are underwritten based on available collateral and/or expected income. When healthy, non-bubblicious (speculative), growth is occurring in the economy, the banking system is not built on a house of cards.  It's built on people's willingness to spend the time to extract a country's natural resources and produce value added goods and services.  Agree, disagree?

I don't understand the "extend more credit than they have cash" bit.  The accounting for making a loan is to "credit" cash and "debit" the loan (in layman terms: reduce cash balances and increase loan balances).  In your example of the money being deposited and loaned over and over again, the bank couldn't lend out the money if the deposit (of cash) didn't come in.  Is that not correct?

I am a (junior) risk management bank examiner for a federal regulatory agency, and I can tell you that no one in my field office seems to understand or have any concern that Bitcoin may significantly impact the banking industry.    Bitcoin is still in the womb.

Could the folks at Coinbase be price-setting and dampening the volatility?  In this TechCrunch video..
    
... at (minute) 20:20 Coinbase founder &amp; CEO Brian Armstrong states "We collect pricing data from a variety of sources, we offset.. we have a lot of flow that happens internally, and basically, a lot of work has gone into pricing our risk in that scenario, so whenever we are issuing quotes we feel very confident that we can actually source at those prices."  (This is said after he explains that Coinbase is not an exchange, but rather an interface to an exchange that provides superior security.)
I don't know the exact volumes that Coinbase runs on a daily basis, but I would think that they may have enough market power to be the price setter; and, since their transactions aren't instantaneous, they would have the ability to administer orders to their advantage (using the risk management strategies that give them confidence in their pricing).   
   
Given that their revenue structure is a percentage of each transaction, I believe that they are better served if bitcoin values continue to increase.  This would attract more investors and potentially increase transaction sizes (people want to own whole coins)... In addition to pushing price increases, Coinbase has a secondary incentive to push for price stability, as this would silence the number one criticism against Bitcoin as a viable currency.  As a Bitcoin investor and believer, I have short-term concerns about the general concentration risk of having so few exchanges/purchasing outlets.  Are my concerns valid or too speculative?

I do know that the primary liquidity for paying deposits and making loans is cash, interest-bearing bank balances (a bank's deposit at another bank), available-for-sale securities, loan payments, the ability to attain brokered deposits, and the ability to borrow from other banks and government agencies.  Unless borrowers have more than $250 thousand (FDIC insurance limit), it would be pointless to withdraw cash out of fear (since the FDIC has never not paid an insured deposit).    
@_date: 2014-01-01 00:03:59
I follow you on the reserve requirements and how money can stretch through lending and "re-deposits."  This seems essential to create enough liquidity for the markets.  The same goes with Bitcoin, the value has to increase in order to make enough units available to a growing user base (i.e. if bitcoins were only worth a penny, then 21,000,000 just would not be enough to go around).

I meant if they made anonymous transactions illegal for US citizens.  Of course the protocol goes on.. but does anyone use it if the US is out?  Not sure..  Seems like other countries would be better off making their own version (replication) of Bitcoin.

Hi Leovingi,
   Thanks for the props for the innovative approach!  However, there is no bitcoin begging here (you may have noticed the lack of a public key in the post).  The blog is donation-based.. but I don't want one satoshi unless I am creating value for the community.  And yes, I am the only one who has submitted ideas for the blog so far.  The posts follow the pseudonym/public key method I'm using for generating content.  Let me know if you think this is an unethical approach. ~ The BBB

With all due respect (none), I am doing an opportunity/threat analysis.
@_date: 2013-12-31 21:09:12
Users are breaking the law and can be arrested.  Risk would be too high for mainstream (no pun intended).  Bitcoin would remain niche.  
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:10:54
I respectfully disagree that using pseudonyms is unethical... it's actually based on the Bitcoin's emphasis for anonymity (I think "Satoshi" would approve). Would it help if I put an asterisk behind pseudonyms so that you know it's not the real person's name?
Regards,

If the ideas are good, people will care.  For example, I liked your ideas for how I can stay anonymous while maintaining high ethical standards, so I incorporated them into the blog.  Here are my updates:     
1. Leading post now says: "*Asterisks denote ideas that have submitted by the BBB team under pseudonyms to provide an example for how your ideas will appear on the blog."     
2. About Section (after explaining the pseudonym method) now says: "Note: All posts with pseudonyms followed by asterisks (e.g. Jana*) were provided by one or more members of the team."    
3. All the posts (that are my ideas) now have an asterisk following the pseudonym.
If you post a public key, I will send you $5 for the constructive feedback and ideas you have provided.  Also, I apologize for misleading you and the 19 other people that have visited my site since I launched it a couple days ago.  I was just trying to get the ball rolling on a good idea.  Thanks again for your time and for helping me demonstrate how donation-based crowd-storming can be extremely efficient.  Happy holidays.  Jeff

Good point.  It would just be set back.. I would imagine that US developers might abandon it as well.. But their are millions of developers elsewhere (of course).

I agree with most if not all of that.  I think it's a myth that banks loan out more money than they have though.  They don't make loans without funding them with deposits, loans from government agencies or capital..  But their capital balances were too low for the excessive risks they took (leading to capital bailouts).  The government or better yet, bank management, could require higher minimum capital ratios.. But that would mean lower returns on equity, which of course is especially unpopular with bankers and investors.

If you are a developer, there are already a couple ideas up on the blog: an app (using bitcoin escrow) to make craigslist transactions safer, an app for managing allowance payments to your kids, and a request for ideas on how to make donations to charity more transparent.  We are working on more daily.  Thanks for reading the post.

I don't get it.. I am trying to do something of value here.  Wrong site for that?
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:23:31
I agree with your suggestion to allow anyone to post, but I feel like I'm accomplishing that by saying: "If you want to contribute your idea(s), post them as a reply to this topic, along with a pseudonym and a public key."  The e-mail address is just an alternative way to get your idea posted to the blog.  Thanks for the feedback.

I am interested in promoting the wave of innovation that Bitcoin could bring.. but to also be enriching a country that is trying to build missiles that can hit me on the west coast?  Not too sure I'm thrilled about that.

I apologize for not understanding here.. why can't governments enforce file sharing laws?

Great points.. Do you think that consumer debt goes away with widespread adoption of bitcoin?  Or will banks start lending in it.  Although interest rates and fees can be ridiculous, it seems like we will still need auto loans, and emergency credit.  I would say that a large majority of consumer debt loads is based on the materialistic society (In the US anyways).  I will look up aggregate credit card fluctuations over holiday season when I get home.

Most of the people I know do not have frequent interactions with people outside the US.  That doesn't mean we are snobs.  In fact, international students were among the most popular in my high school and college classes.  I guess I am agreeing with both you and JCdobber (that we are mostly about ourselves), but I would say that many of us Americans just don't get out all that much and our news stations rarely cover international news (ok CNN covers protests and our wars).  Do you think we should read more about the rest of the world?  And if so, how would we benefit from doing so?

If terrorists owned a 10% stake in bitcoins, would Bitcoin be a greater tool for easing transactions and reducing interest rate risk, or for financing terror?

Unfortunately (for Bitcoin), libertarians are in the minority here.  We already have the Customer Identification Program requirements in financial institution regulations (which cover almost anyone that deals with money, including gas stations that offer money orders.  Even Coinbase is under such jurisdiction, or at least they seem to be following it.

I thought that the key milestone that bitcoin is trying to achieve is sales of physical goods and services via merchants (to establish legitimacy as a currency).  I am not sure that merchants would risk their life's work to make a bitcoin sale when they will need to convert it to cash anyways (to pay taxes).  I get that the gov. can't stop file sharing, but that doesn't seem to have anything to do with bitcoin because the point of file sharing is to get the files for free.  I also understand that the bitcoin protocol is setup like email/torrent, but it would seem like a currency of limited use if you couldn't legally buy physical goods with it.  All I am trying to do is determine if the US government could make bitcoin illegal by just changing the coverage of the Bank Secrecy Act.  Shouldn't all Bitcoin believers be assessing its long term viability?

I am new to the site and didn't realize the site had so many international users.  However, my point seems relevant for the short term valuation of bitcoin because a large majority of transactions are in the US and China (where they are being purchased to convert yuan to USD), at least that is what I have read.
