At least 1 BTC is less than 4 BTC that guy lost. It's clear to me now: Brain wallets are just easter eggs waiting to be discovered. This should be spread out to everybody before more people lose their savings.

No. For sure.

Interesting read, thank you. Very expensive indeed.

After my experience perhaps I should not tell you to avoid something similar. Anyway: if you hash a sentence (or any document) through SHA256 you obtain 256 characters that you can use as your private key. With that you create the public key and it's address associated (13Kai...).

This was known in 2015:

Very interesting read, thank you.
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:34:00
Gee! Thanks for the support.
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:35:11
Thank you. Same there, wish you a good 2018.

That is a random sentence! If you were my girlfriend icestationlemur, the crazy things we would do.

I agree that this is precisely the point. Xapo and anybody else, is free to ask whatever they think it's their right or duty, but it should be noticed in advance, not after hijacking my bitcoins.

The faucet promised two things:
1. That I could transfer lower amounts.
2. That I would be credited bigger amounts in my future ad-clicking.

I don't frown upon faucets, but after my experience with several of them I understand why most people do not recommend them:
1. The pay very little for your time. You have to read around 2000 ads during several weeks to make one buck.
2. They play tricks: A "simple" questionnaire starts with 1 of 20 questions, then continues with 1 of 7, then 1 of 15 and on and on. Many times, they also request lots of information from you before allowing you to get your price.
3. You are not able to collect your bitcoins until you have made a big bunch of them (normally after more than one week of work) and the money actually is ridiculously low, like some cents.
4. Many are outright scams, asking for your email to spam you, knowing full well you will not complete the requirements because they are set in loops one after the other until you give up.
There is just some of my observations. I could continue but I do not want to be too wordy on the subject. Hope you understand that the best way to have quick bitcoins is to buy them, even if it is just spending 20 bucks.

Thank you sir. I also read your comments on another reddit and now I realized how bad it is.

Hi Aaron, it might be a lot to ask, but would it be too complicate to have a version for iOS7.0.4? I am jailbroken and it's a hassle moving up. Thanks.

Wah! winlifeat, thanks a lot! I hope my contribution is really worth your tip.

I looked at that possibility with MultiBit classic and it does not have it. Do you know withhoser, whether the transaction would eventually die off and the bitcoins return to their original address, or would they be lost "forever" in an unconfirmed limbo?  
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:08:04
Thanks for the info ismith23. I just left the default settings using MultiBit.
@_date: 2017-03-05 05:42:36
Sounds interesting! Do you have some software that would allow me to do that?
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:09:28
I used MultiBit. Fee of 0.0001.
@_date: 2017-03-06 14:53:26
Thank you jacobthedane. Definitely the last time I use MultiBit Classic. I have tried Electrum and looks promising, but will definitely try Bread Waller and Mycelium.
