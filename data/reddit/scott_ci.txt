Thanks for watching. The fee thing was kinda tacked on at the end. I'm hoping to do one more iteration based on the feedback I get here.

I've been on a silly journey trying to distill Bitcoin into a manageable explanation.  It started with an ungodly long (22min!)  first version that has gotten a lot of views (.5m,   but caters to programmers, and is of course terribly long. This is my attempt to explain the main ideas to a broader audience in a much shorter time. I'm hoping to get critical feedback from the experts here. thanks!
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:53:28
great feedback. There are lots of videos out there that explain what is and what it's for, like the one on the Bitcoin homepage (bitcoin.org). You think newbies / non-tech folks still want something in between the Bitcoin Homepage video and this one?
There's probably space for a 2 minute video that stays out of the weeds even more. 
One of my goals here was to explicitly explain what math problem is being solved. I suspect many people would be happy with "and then math makes it work."

good feedback to hear, thanks.

thanks for watching and giving feedback! that was an intentional skip for brevity, but I should probably add a star or something. Will consider the other addition about the ledger being tamper-proof, too.
@_date: 2014-09-07 03:42:34
great feedback... I'm never sure how to explain one piece without all the other pieces. Will consider doing the smaller videos for different aspects.

privacy is tricky, if you get Bitcoin from a US exchange, they collect your full identity. Also, even if you generate a different address for every received amount, those payments will be linked on the blockchain if you ever spend more than any of the inputs. 
I do like my bank not knowing where and what I purchase.
When I started a very small biz, I lost ~$1400 to a chargeback. AMEX pulled the money straight out of my bank. As a merchant, I would probably offer a discount for Bitcoin purchases.
For eBooks and digital goods, purchasing with Bitcoin is a ton easier and faster than entering in credit card details. I agree that it's more risky without Mastercard in the middle to refund my money, though.

This is my attempt at a shorter and slightly less technical version of my original 22 minute [How Bitcoin Works Under the Hood]( video.

wow, biggest tip ever! Thank you!
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:58:34
Mining fees are market based, so they will automatically adjust. I've read arguments that Bitcoin is not any less energy efficient than Visa or Mastercard (maybe much more!), so if electricity cost rose a lot, using those methods would also be more expensive. Finally, if electricity costs go up, fewer people will mine, which automatically reduces the mining difficulty.

Thanks for the replies, very helpful. I like your sentence:


I'm curious how universal the view is that miners don't define the ruleset, or at least play a role in voting on it. Perhaps we'll find out in the resolution of the current block size debate.
@_date: 2016-03-06 16:36:50
thanks, it was actually that post that partially spurred my question. you wrote: 


Based on killerstorm 's answer, it makes sense to me that if **users** (economic majority) don't like a new rule (e.g. an increase in Bitcoin supply), the price of Bitcoin will drop, which definitely impacts miners.
Even if there weren't many full nodes at the moment the miners went off track, I believe a new network would emerge over time that supports the will of the users. In the short term, perhaps the miners could sell some coins, but eventually exchanges and wallets would adjust. Having many full nodes would definitely speed up this feedback mechanism, but I don't see how the percentage of full nodes itself is protective. 
Even with lots of full nodes, such a split would be chaotic and damaging. Miners would be on a network that few want to buy coins from; others would be on a network susceptible to 51% attacks due to a low hash rate. 
Perhaps lots of full nodes reduces any short term gain miners could capture, but long term it seems like miners would still be overcome even if there weren't many full nodes today.

I think in the short term, you could refuse to accept a transaction that didn't play by your rules, but longer term, people need to agree on rules, and that is the function of miners in my mind.  
Bitcoin without the proof-of-work consensus provided by the miners is not Bitcoin. It doesn't matter if I want a different set of rules than the rest of the world. Based on your response, I think I could re-phrase my question as "why does it matter if you check your own transactions"? Perhaps we'll be choosing the highest difficulty chain with the rules we like among several chains at some point, in which case it would make sense to check.

This was all easier when every node was also a miner...
If miners don't matter, how does everyone else--the users--reach consensus? I thought the main innovation of bitcoin was a way to reach provable, anonymous, distributed consensus via proof of work.
@_date: 2016-03-06 14:38:45
I get that miners would not want to mess up their income stream, I just don't understand why it matters whether there are 10 miners and 10 full nodes or 10 miners and 10,000 full nodes. If the miners veer from what the [economic majority]( wants, they'll wreck the price of newly minted coins. The term "economic majority" is very helpful. I think I understand how the "economic majority" keeps the miners in check, just not why having a huge number of full nodes is critical. 
I do get that full nodes are critical to the network to relay transactions and support wallets, but if we have enough full nodes to support these functions, do extra nodes somehow exert additional leverage over miners? In other words, what if Bitcoin had a similar number of nodes to a good [CDN]( would more be helpful?
@_date: 2016-03-07 11:29:16


The rules are defined by the users of the network.
This is good, because I think it highlights my misunderstanding or disagreement. Suppose a 2MB blocksize change is introduced as a hard fork, if 55% of miners upgrade to the 2MB code, the longest chain (technically, the chain with the most cumulative difficulty) will be the 2MB version. Is that the authoritative shared ledger, or the shorter chain that's still on 1MB sizes?
Please note: I'm not advocating for a hard fork or block size increase, I'm just trying to use a realistic scenario to clarify my understanding on the role of miners.

Very interesting comparison to paypal and other traditional systems in that video, thanks. Not sure how everything will compare when Bitcoin scales, as it will depend on how many "full" clients are processing every txn. That video said paypal and Bitcoin use about the same energy, but paypal processes about 7x the number of transactions now? I still think the total energy use will end up being a balance between electricity cost and txn fees, irrespective of technology (ASICs, etc). If Ripple is actually secure, it seems like it has a massive energy use advantage on Bitcoin... no hash solving. Thanks again for watching.

I made the video. I'm working on a 3-4 min version that's more accessible. I've known that lay people didn't exactly walk away with a great understanding, but knowing you already had an understanding of hashes and are still not clear is good to know. The linked video is definitely geared towards programmers more than general public.
@_date: 2013-09-23 00:24:21
Thanks for all the comments (I made it). Started out trying to make a 5 minute video and ended up at 22 after lots of cutting. Had no idea how complex Bitcoin was until I started down the rabbit hole. Working on a 3 minute version now. Appreciate any and all critical feedback.
@_date: 2013-07-16 20:44:05
Correct me if I'm wrong here, but the important part is the effort exerted to solve the puzzles, so once ASICs are adopted more, won't the difficulty be increased, and number of hashes required? Even if an ASIC can calc more hashes / watt, does that matter? I need to read more about the energy use of other global payment networks.
@_date: 2013-07-16 20:31:10
I'll put a popup note in the video warning about the over-simplification. I didn't think the difference was important for gaining an intuitive understanding of the security, but I could be convinced otherwise.
@_date: 2013-07-16 17:05:32
I don't believe the block solution time affects security, just stability. Rosenfeld's paper ( claims that security is just about the number of blocks, and not time of each block, but I'm not sure I agree with that either. I think it's just the total time back, regardless of block duration.
Anyway, my mentioning of Litecoin was mostly just to say "something else exists" and functions, although it certainly hasn't been tested like Bitcoin.
