Newer ones are more colorful, no?
Gotta fold them like in that shitty Daredevil movie :D

Awesome! I have bought some Grime dice before and I love numberphile and 60 symbols, et al.

By generating keypairs, i assume. It's a (fairly) expensive process.

Well, they don't get to say "we just violated our core principle, just because we had no other choice". That's not what principles are about, in my view.

Few days ago I tried to purchase a laptop from NewEgg, just to realize that a price swing put the bitcoin total out of my funds by .04 btc. Since I have not found a way to see what the BTC final price was, and Bitpay only gives 15 minutes to complete the transaction, it would always be a gamble.
If the newegg Bitcoin transaction does not succeed, one must abandon the whole shopping card and start another. 
So I wrote this greasemonkey script to pre-fetch the rate information from BitPay (NewEgg's processor) before checkout, so one can be sure that one has enough funds to cover the bill.
Edit: Screenshot
Tested in Firefox. Should work on both .com/.ca (using USD and CAD respectively).

Whatever, the whole situation with his contribution did not warrant *that much* hype. And the fact that they do a 180 right after is still questionable at best.

Honestly though, tap to pay is awesome.

Never say never. New direction after Eich's dismissal is slightly disturbing. Going to bed with DRM crowd is a bad sign all around.

you can keygen private keys for bitcoin with a D6. Substitute all sixes for zeroes, roll 99 times and then use base-6 to convert that to a WIF on

I had my address posted in my Russian LiveJournal.
Guess it was scrapped from there, and these were sent to me just now...

It's append only with occasional pruning. You can't edit commits, the edits generate fully new commits with different hashes.

I even tried contacting the guy when GLBSEv1 went down and v2 showed up... to no avail :(
@_date: 2016-09-23 02:36:44
Commits do contain hashes of previous commits, so it's a crypto-chain of sorts.
@_date: 2016-09-23 04:50:48
Those are just pointers. Underlying data is still available. All changes are still retained and are available.

Well, if one went out the way to enable 3rd party APK installs, got a 3rd party market, allowed the app full admin access - then they probably had it coming...

Leave it to the Germans and their very anal attentiveness to details.

You could try buying it online from Play Store with an american proxy, and get some re-shipping service to ship it to Suomi :)
Would still be cheaper than $650, but with bit more risk.

Not that I'm a fan of these crack-addiction style games, but it helps to spread bitcoin...

Don't forget that incarceration is a very profitable business, and there's a lot of lobbying efforts going on so that more people end up in jails and make money for certain people.
Incarceration will not drop off because there's less crimes, simply more crimes worthy of incarceration will be invented by the powers that be.

$250 for a 16Gb version.

Keep in mind that oxygen is an oxidizer (i know, right). And at 100% purity it would start all sorts of nasty reactions.

Asked them in twitter ( to share some bitcoin purchase stats... I guess more people could ask them. For reasons.

Well, that's why you always authenticate with something you know, never just something you have.
Besides, as that other argument (re: iphone fingerprint scanner) went, police can't compel you to divulge your password, because that is private information, but your fingerprints are not, so they can unlock your phone/account/bank statement, whatever... without it being a privacy violation.

It simply means that biometrics should only be used for **identification** and not **authentication**.

I posted some bitcoin-related stuff there, mostly to be met with disregard, rather than contempt of any kind.

I might probably just try and do it. I just got an email from them that they have launched, and being involved with Bitcoin Vancouver scene I though that it's a pretty good idea...
Just not sure if I can articulate the benefits of bitcoin eloquently enough.

Someone pitched bitcoin for OUYA preorders, but was told that staff is not hanging out there much. I know that they will be doing an IamA sometime in april though.

It's unlocked. You can use it for any carrier, as long as they have the right frequencies (as in, there's poor LTE support, but there's AWS and other most common ones).
