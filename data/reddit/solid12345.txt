To be honest though if you can't trust your coins to any 3rd party, crypto will never succeed. There is a reason banks were invented in the first place, most people don't want to be or aren't capable of being responsible to guard their own money.  
What we need is crypto insurance globally among the biggest exchanges and if people want to complain about the increased fees, they should suck it up or not trade.

What are you babbling about? I've been trading cryptocurrencies for two years.

If no 3rd party website can be trusted to hold Bitcoin then how can e-commerce function? Imagine if Amazon was doing millions in Bitcoin sales a day, then they too would be a target.
Crypto insurance is still the best short-term solution IMO. I know it's hard to find companies willing to cover it but if there is a market out there for it, one will develop but companies need to demand it even if i means raising fees.

The problem is perception is reality. For a few years the perception of Bitcoin itself among the general public was it is a currency for drugs and nefarious activities. It is slowly going mainstream and getting away from that image, but for something like Monero, it will be like where Bitcoin was 3-4 years ago and it WILL be viewed as a currency for shady activity for awhile among the masses. 
Hate to say it but politicians are ignorant because their constituents are ignorant. 
The irony though is the rise of more private-centric coins like Monero is good for BTC's image because now people will think "oh so Bitcoin isn't so anonymous after all..." 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:59:37
Agreed but if you can't trust an exchange with your money, many of whom have qualified IT technicians at the helm, how can you trust your grandma or your boss and his small company getting into crypto to hold wealth securely. 
I know it all sounds good and dandy for everyone to hold their private keys on their own phone or PC but you underestimate how many people out there can barely even remember their 4-5 character email password much less figure out how to use a Bitcoin wallet. Don't forget how many virus-laden Windows PCs exist out there as well.
I'm just trying to be realistic that the majority of consumers will require some responsible 3rd party fiduciary services if crypto is going to go mainstream at least in the short term, i.e 5-10 years.
Obviously the fact so many people keep ignoring the general wisdom of keeping money off the exchanges is evidence itself alot of crypto users don't even trust themselves with their own money.
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:40:14
What i've always wondered is how much safer would exchanges be if withdrawals were only done on a one or two-time per 24 hour basis and only approved manually by a human being on the other end?

You know the sad part, whether you love him or hate him, Ver tried to warn everyone over a year ago that memory backlogs and fees will spiral out of control and now they are. 
Also on the subject of Roger Ver and fees, I actually dislike the man immensely for other reasons, but if this were really all about money, he'd stand more to gain to just shut up and accept the status quo since he is one of the biggest Bitcoin whales. He is taking a very dangerous game pushing Cash that is fracturing the ecosystem, but it's because he genuinely believes in it, even if you think he is wrong or a moron.

@_date: 2015-12-20 17:18:36
Only problem with this thinking is Bitcoin will never succeed unless there is secured, licensed and insured 3rd party wallets. The vast majority of people will never be able to or want to trust their life savings on a Windows or mobile phone wallet, face it most people are not technical enough to secure Bitcoins themselves. I'd dare say the average computer in the wild is probably even less secure than a service like Coinbase when you consider how many people unknowingly use a malware infected OS on a daily basis.

They will exist and thrive because they will do things that the Bitcoin Foundation is too scared to touch, such as encrypted private VOIP or ring signature/zero-knowledge transactions.
Also next year we are going to see the rise of commodity tokens like Urocoin that are backed on commodities such as DAP, Urea, Sugar, Wheat, Soy etc. that will act almost as futures coins and eventually be less volatile and more practical for transactions of expensive commodities between global importers. Imagine a farmer being able to buy 1 ton of Urea with Urocoin at say 300 USD, hold onto it a year, and when Urea prices rise to 400 USD next year, he can cash it in and still get his 1 ton of Urea for 100 dollars less than the market price while bypassing international banks, government subsidy programs and red tape. This will be revolutionary.

Who said anything about 100,000 alt coins? I'm talking a good solid several dozen alt coins that will exist and thrive alongside Bitcoin. 
Sorry but I just find it disingenuous for Bitcoin technocrats to call the alt community "scammers" while they simultaneously want to harvest all the good things coming out of this community and ensure no one who invested in the alt world can profit from it. If the alt world is made of crooks why do they want their innovations on top of Bitcoin so bad?

Personally if I could opine...I got into crypto January 14 of this year, I won't lie it was the media attention of the BTC and LTC run-up that drew me in, I mean who doesn't want to get rich overnight, right, right? 
Of course instead I got suckered in buying bags of BTC at 800 dollars a coin and immediately pulled into the funny business of "will China ban, won't they ban..." and saw my investment slowly slide downward pretty fast. 
During this I discovered the alt world and quickly learned there is more money to be made fast investing in new alts that quickly explode in price in a matter of weeks in some instances and did pretty well for myself, alot better had I just held onto my BTC and LTC only.
Now having traded alts for a year now, I can firmly say, yes, alot of them are scams. Were many a gambling tool just to acquire more BTC? Sure. But if one is to look deeper there are alot of innovative new developments underneath the pile of mud, you had Counterparty developing smart contracts, the rise of cryptonotes and ring signatures, Darkcoin Masternodes, heck there is even blockchain skype-like VOIP with Korecoin now or decentralized ads like Craigslist with Craigscoin. Don't even get me started on Blackcoin, Shadowcoin or URO, boundaries are being pushed everyday. There is some major talent in the alt world doing amazing things and even more amazing is still how cheap these alts are for what their intrinsic value is.
Now here is the elephant in the room. As a newbie I saw at the beginning of the year how members of the Bitcoin cartel as I like to call it, detested the idea of "polluting" the BTC blockchain with more add-ons, Counterparty in particular fought a long battle over this which is one reason Viacoin was created in the first place. However now I find it curious that after a good year of alt developments and the rise of coins like Darkcoin or Bitshares that managed to even pass Litecoin or Ripple in value at some points, suddenly BTC devs and spokespersons are running around screaming, "sidechains, sidechains, end these alt scams, we don't need them!"
So what changed their minds all of a sudden? Call me a conspiracy theorist but I think alot of early Bitcoin technocrats who are also whales see something of a threat to their investment in some up and coming coins. Now why they do is just silly to me as there is plenty of wealth in the world to sustain more than one digital currency, but I find it rather questionable how developers who call alts scams suddenly want to swoop in and copy everything the alt community has done after the fact and throw it on the BTC blockchain with no added tokens or values attached to said work. 
To me it is all about protecting the wealth of BTC whales who already hold a disproportionate amount of coins and who are the only ones able to afford the massive hash needed to profitably mine Bitcoin, the little guy miners have been shut out of the BTC market and went to mining alts instead where there is still some reward and satisfaction for finding a block. 
If you are truly for decentralization, you should be against Bitcoin monopolizing the crypto market and be for competition and more blockchains. Bitcoin is already the gold standard of crypto, but there is plenty of room for silver, bronze, and platinum. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:27:31

I wasn't even at Urose and was only an investor, but I was a journalism major once and the state of ethics in the crypto world is abysmal. Does anyone even own a AP style guide? Does no one actually pick up a phone and call people anymore to get information instead of relying on google? It is not just CT, it is symptomatic of the industry itself, they are like tabloids and not trade publications. 
As for the Urose article specifically, I saw no reason to point out that Joshua Zeidner, aka bluemeanie was relevant to anything at hand. Would you open up an article on NXT accusing jl777 of hocking useless assets for his own profit gain? Speak to the facts at hand rather than mere accusations or typical bitcointalk fud and drama.
As for where Urocoin is now, whether it's a scam or a colossal failed project is debatable, I'm certainly upset that Bohan has seemingly disappeared from the face of the Earth, in fact I'm the one who bought uro.io and forwarded it to his ebay account, but the fact remains using lies and monumental untruths to discredit a suspected scam project is not the proper way to go about things. It is like when altcoinherald just flat out made up an accusation Bohan Huang copied GES's website assets and the company went out of business years ago which was clearly not true. Or that there were multiple Bohans, that people were photoshopped, that Nilesh Nair didn't exist or spoke English, this was just ridiculous conspiracy theory level nonsense.
This is one reason the community bit back at your article so viciously, it felt like another lame hit job piece on the project we had been accustomed to for months, we felt there was clearly a malice towards the coin from day 1, the kind of hatred and raised eyebrows that none of you guys in the industry EVER give all the various scam coins that pop up from day to day. Has Cointelegraph ever pointed out Darkcoin's instamine for instance? I seem to recall CT wrote positively about Fuelcoin which is a typical Ponzi/multi-level marketing scheme coin. The list goes on.
If Urocoin were to have truly been investigated properly, some time could have been spent researching Green Earth System's past business background or reaching out to the various NIERS and piecing together whether this company is really doing multi-million dollar deals or operating out of a boiler room. Declaring it just "feels" shady is no substitute for real research.

It's to conduct and do business!

Bitcoin is technically a dinosaur too comparing it's age and the tech advances in the alt market

Oh fuck off with the drama queen bullshit, this is common legal sense. How can you claim evidence was illegally seized through fruit of the poisonous tree tactics if you won't admit the evidence is yours? Ross's through his lawyer wouldn't admit to owning it because then he incriminates himself.

I tried to explain Bitcoin to a layman the other day, it was hard for them to understand. They think I can easily screw them or take their money or that it can be counterfeited or that things live up "in the cloud".

"If you don't belieb that the Bitcoin will only work if you get rich, you should probably get out. Because this is a very slow, long play."
This is where I disagree. Bitcoin can never work as a global currency without a huge market cap.

I don't see what the problem of SDC distribution is, its been at a sideways price for months with plenty of healthy sell walls to nibble at and one can buy 1% of the coins supply for a few bitcoins.
Compare this to Monero or Dark which spent much of their early exchange lives in the 50 cents to a dollar range and more, unless you mined alot of them early on you needed alot of money to become a whale on those coins to begin with. 
Now is the best time then ever to get into SDC because I don't see it going much cheaper.

Mostly because they are too poor to need one in this economy. Who needs a bank when Wal-mart cash your minimum wage or government check for you?

Who made btc-e judge &amp; jury? Are evo admins who stole from their customers any better or worse than their customers selling stolen credit cards or merchandise for instance?

I'm not saying the CIA doesn't do shady things but why is it but if I say something like I believe the Russians smuggled Saddam's WMD out of Iraq into Syria with even satellite photos of trucks going in and out of the border weeks before the war then I am just kooky?

So because some criminals stole from other criminals everyone else's withdrawals should be halted? No offense to those who got robbed at evolution but that is the risk you take dealing in that world.

I can't even believe how many people fell for it, I barely knew anything about GAW and seeing that horribly photoshopped warehouse full of ant miners and Garza's shit-eating grin made me stay away from it from day 1.
The sad part is how it attracted so many huge whales and volume, there are lots of legit coins just begging for even 1/100th of the attention and volume xpy got yet those with money won't take a chance on them...

"There's no sense carrying forward old transaction details for historical purposes in the bitcoin network."
Maybe not on the network but SOMEONE should be archiving it. What else is the purpose of a blockchain but to give a record to what can't be tampered with?

Neither really. My main question is let's pretend there is 200 million dollars worth of mining equipment keeping the bitcoin network running (making this up out of my head). Why would a bank want to invest in these outside civilian miners when they can just easily purchase 200 million worth of distributed machines and build their own internal network? 
The strength of Bitcoin to me has always been as a hedge currency that isn't controlled by any government or bank. These banks ultimately just want a cheaper and more efficient and secure way to move fiat. I don't see why Bitcoin is inherently attractive as a business model for them unless they have reservations about the future strength of the US dollar and view Bitcoin more as an investment.

Hence again why the BTC community should be more focused on actually using Bitcoin as a currency instead of something just to trade and make USD with. Buy and sell goods with BTC and the state doesn't have to know.

I'm not a fan of Max or his political viewers but the crypto community showed what drama queens they were over Maxcoin. Because public pools weren't available in the opening hours hence it is forever tagged a scam coin, god forbid you have to wait half a day to mine a new coin throughout its lifetime.

Forgive my ignorance as I don't dabble in dark markets but how is it these sites get to where they are hoarding so many bitcoins? Do vendors really not withdraw their money after making a few sales and treat it like a bank? Did anyone not learn anything from Gox, SR and now Evolution?

People need to take things in context.
As much as I like Bitcoin, I can easily imagine the average CEO of a bank going, "so do we trust our ledger to a few huge Chinese mining farms or build our own internal ones?"
The elephant in the room is actually how centralized Bitcoin has become which is why big companies are reluctant to use it.

Personally if there is some manipulation that is going to be going on anyway, I wish whales would actually move the price up again instead of dumping everytime good news comes out...
