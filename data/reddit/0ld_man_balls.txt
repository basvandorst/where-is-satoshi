This has to be probably the most naive post I've seen on reddit. Hope you're prepared to lose most of that money and the bridge thing was just a joke, because it'll soon be your reality otherwise.

If that was the case, then everything else like food and physical goods would be expensive and we'd be experiencing hyperinflation within the broader economy. As it is, bitcoin and crypto are the only securities showing such effects, the actual CPI in developed countries is in fact below most bank targets of 2%, aside from Britain's due to brexit.
We'll see if tether is a drop in the bucket when the audit comes next year, my popcorn is ready :)

The fact you're measuring cryptocurrency's success in terms of USD should tell you something about your approach. The fact that so many are doing the same should tell you something about the market. The fact nobody's saying anything about tether is what's most concerning to me.

Yes there has been on average 2% inflation. If prices went down and the value of money went up, people wouldn't spend and instead hoard the currency. Prices go down for the people savvy enough to invest in assets, they go up for people who take a passive approach to their finances. But the point is, a currency needs to slowly go down in value to encourage the people to spend and invest it. Otherwise you end up with a situation like bitcoin where everyone "hodls" and it's original purpose is lost. Imagine trying to run an economy using a "store of value" as a currency.. impossible!
Based on current bitcoin market depth, if $125 million bitcoin were sold instantaneously, the price would be back at $5000 per btc. Now imagine if $1 billion were sold instantaneously, we're talking sub $1000 levels. That's the "drop in the ocean" you referred to as the Tether scandal, and that fraudulent sum is increasing all the time, along with bitcoin price. But hey, we're going to the moon, right?!

So in your eyes, bitcoin price increase has absolutely NOTHING to do with the fraudulent creation of over $1bln (and counting) Tethers, used to buy up and create fake demand in BTC and other cryptos in order to drive up the price?

Even if it went to 50k he would only just over double his money lol. and as it is the transaction fees are crippling it. These people are actually insane.

Dumb move. Once it's back down at $8k you'll wish you waited.

... as well as realise your profits at the right time, which is something HODLers will miss out on because they believe price to be an S-curve with no downside risk at all.
