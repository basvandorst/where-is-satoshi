market value?  as in, bank rates?  or market value as in the shitty rate that commercial banks give commercial clients for small-denomination trades?  unless your wife is making million dollar trades,  she is getting a significantly worse rate than what you'd see on sites like oanda.com.  case in point,  right now on a 1000 CAD trade,  royal bank offers 885.11 USD.  Oanda quotes a market rate of 911.20. That's  being charged 1.1298 vs 1.09725.  on small trades,  who cares I guess.   But on a 10k trade or a 100k trade that's a few hundred or thousand you could have kept in your pocket.  I don't know how much OP's buddy is looking to exchange,  but if it's up around 10k or more and he would rather save 200+ by doing a bit of legwork,  then he - and everyone like him - should look into forex trading houses like those I mentioned.  a lifetime of getting hosed on exchange rates can add up.

i have to agree... not being able to choose what goes in the box...let alone not being able to suggest a general type of candy you want in the box is a pretty huge deterrent. 
The only reference to contents i saw was liquorice and gingerbread cookies - I hate both. :(
So yeah... What he said!

If he's got USD, no. But he has CAD.  Only way he can send that south using your suggestion is by allowing RBC to convert it to USD at a supremely shitty rate of exchange.  Technically not "hidden" though, so I guess you're technically right on this point.

Bitcoin/USD is currently 490.  Bitcoin/CAD is currently 532. Seems to me you're gonna get dinged on "exchange" either way if you buy bitcoin as a means of "americanizing" your cash holdings. 
As for RedStarDawn's suggestion, opening a US RBC Bank acct is fine if you already hold USD, but it doesn't help if you've only got CAD. During your North-South CAD transfer, you will be quoted a horrible CAD/USD exchange rate by RBC before allowing you to transfer the funds to RBC Bank.
Because of the generally horrible exchange rates offered by commercial banks nationwide, I would suggest setting up an account at a specialty currency exchange house.  I have used one in Vancouver (VBCE) and one in Toronto (Ascendant FX - which is/was affiliated with VBCE). Custom House also exists in Vancouver, and there may be more if you care to research. Both offer significantly better exchange rates that improve with increased trade volumes.  I would honestly go this route.  Certainly above all the other options presented to you here, which weren't really solutions with your problem in mind at all... Good luck with the move, friend :)
EDIT: Custom House seems to have been bought out by Western Union.  Dunno about that option anymore.  Might still be better than commercial banks.  VBCE in Vancouver and Ascendant FX in Toronto both appear to be the same companies I've done business with in the past and wouldn't hesitate recommending either.

anything to back up your theory or was it just the first thought that popped into your mind?

seems you're referring to 0.007 bitcoins/gh, not $/gh, which is a fairly significant difference... one being impossibly cheap and the other being ridiculously expensive.
