Try incognito or a different browser. That worked for me.

Everyone keeps claiming that the guy doesn't know English well but I think that's absurd.
His amazon reviews and other recent works seem to be written intentionally bad.
Check out this post from him in 2004: 
His grammar is substantially better. Not perfect but he's writing an informal post and using abbreviations.
The man came to America at the age of 10 and is highly educated. How could his English possibly be that bad?

Doing is how someone learns.
Jesus, this subreddit is so cynical and you wonder why people are so scared away from bitcoin.

I'm not very convinced he's the author of those posts either but I have a strong feeling he is, in some way, tied to bitcoin. There are just too many coincidences and things that just don't add up.
Here's a few things that seem strange to me:
* Some events on the bitcoin timeline seem to line up with his life. Bitcoin was developed by Satoshi from 2001-2010. Dorian lost his job after 9/11 and was unemployed from 2000-2010. Satoshi disappeared from the internet in 2010. Dorian also apparently had a stroke around this time.
* In her article Leah claims that she was in correspondence with Dorian about his train hobby and suddenly stopped responding when she mentioned bitcoin. If he truly just had no idea what bitcoin was then why wouldn't he just say so at the time? Purportedly Leah contacted members of his family to ask him about bitcoin as well and he just refused to talk about it. Why would he refuse so sternly to talk about something that he now claims he didn't even know about? Wouldn't he have just plainly said that he doesn't know what that is? Of course this is assuming Leah is telling the truth and not being misleading.
* In his recent video interview he just seems like he's hiding something. He's very defensive and seems upset that people think he's involved with bitcoin. If he had nothing to hide I don't see why he would be so defensive. He also seems like he's intentionally playing stupid. Maybe this can be ascribed to his stroke, but we know Dorian is a well educated very intelligent person and yet he struggles to even remember the name of it. He improperly calls it "bitcorn" at one point. He also says he was "never in communication with bitcoins". That seems like he's trying overly hard to give an impression that he has no idea what bitcoin is and or he has a poor grasp of English. There's no way someone who came to America at the age of 10 and received a high level of education would speak English that poorly. It just doesn't make sense.

Is this in the Vanderbilt museum on Long island?
