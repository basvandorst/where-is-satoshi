I know. You bought a lot of lite coin. Tell me more. By the way I have some litecoin I mined so I’m not hating on it. Just saying that calling it the bronze to bitcoins gold is the biggest bullshit I’ve ever heard.

People chasing Litecoin... when it's the same fundamental technology as bitcoin. Huge mistake. There are tons of ALTS with potential. Litecoin won't survive longterm. Sorry

This is interesting. Because I work in advertising, and a friend of mine who works for Paypal posted about his new ad.
I came to Reddit and posted [this](
And then u/shipod made his post **after** mine. I guess he made the video, so all the credit for the idea goes to him, but still wish I could get a nod for thinking of it.

There were no comments about Bitcoin on the video when I made my post.
People started posting comments about bitcoin on the video after visiting from Reddit
It wasnt your idea.


Such a trivial matter that you drummed up press support and got a WSJ article.

Just to be clear, I posted that someone should make a parody of this video over a day ago and it was on the front page here.

Wow. This kid made the video, but then claimed he came up with the idea.
Oh well.

Does it do watch only addresses? On the web? And on mobile?
