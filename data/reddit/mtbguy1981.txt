Can't believe all the people falling for this story.  How many 10 kids know what bit coin is, let alone what a Ponzi scheme is...

Omg thank you.... does anyone in this sub know any 10 year olds?  Know any teachers?  I'd love to do a survey of how many 4th grade teachers know what bit coin is.

Oh yeah.... that's a 10 year old alright

What I'm saying is that the penmanship looks like a 6 year old and the content/sentence structure/diction looks like a high school junior or senior.

Hey OP.. would you kind posting another essay your soon wrote?  He seems awfully advanced for a 10 year old

I love JRE podcast... But Joe isn't exactly dumb... I think he just smokes too much weed.  He gets caught up in dumb little details alot and gets side tracked easily.  Most of the time his guests make the show worth listening to.

Definitely agree.. his first appearance really got me interested in Bitcoin.  I find his explanations of the 08 crash and other basic economic principles are fascinating and easy to understand... Basically I want a him to do a weekly economics podcast... He really had a gift for it.

Because its too complicated for the average consumer at this point.  I also have zero need for it.
