Use Blockfolio.

Bittrex or Binance.

Binance is good with no verification process. Otherwise I’d say Bittrex

How much does this come out to in USD? $130 about?
And how long does it take

Shut up and HODL. You put too much if you’re crying with your weak little hands.

Couple days?? Did you order directly from the website? Or from amazon

Might be a stupid question. I transferred out 0.02 bitcoin from Coinbase to GDax equaling to $351 USD. 
Then 20 minutes later I transferred back to Coinbase 0.02 BTC at now $320 USD. Did I get charged to move this? What am I missing?

Alfred? I like that ;) stop BSing by the way

You must put money in USD for it to be instant 
Otherwise you must wait 5-7 business days

If I have only $3,000 USD worth of BTC, LTC, ETH..is it really worth it to buy hardware wallet such as Ledger Nano S? 
Wouldn’t transferring between my Coinbase/GDax account accumulate fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:30:35
What was the total in USD?

If you have an account on Coinbase, you should be able to open up GDAX. They are the same.

Lol what are you 17? Using your parents money ? Look at your sorry post panicking

Question..I made two bank purchases for BTC. One on December 8th (which has cleared) and one on December 7th..which has not cleared yet. Any reason for this? 
The December 8th transaction cleared 3 days ago. 
Still waiting on the one from the 7th. Both were purchased same method. 
Any insights will help. Thank you

So I didn’t lose any BTC correct? I just lost money since the price of BTC went down right? 
Exchanging from GDAX back to Coinbase didn’t lose me money right?

Also, go on a desktop and you should be able to see when it will clear. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:44:53
Stop panicking.
