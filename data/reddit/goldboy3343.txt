Dont worry bro....crypto wont go!!!
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:02:09
I can convert some of altcoins into btc...atleast it will be safe
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:05:37
So what you mean is keep.buying btc and eth....while other altcoins make profits
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:20:32
So it still wouldnt reach  below 5k usd or 0...if thats the case i am happy as fuck
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:17:53
Pc?why would your pc crash
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:31:04
What i mean is i know we can buy fraction. ..but i couldn't because i bought btc from my dads money...and my dad is very skeptical about it..he thinks all of cryptocurrencies are based on speculation. ..but i have researched the technology behind all the cryptocurrencies..see if had bought at the starting of 2017 i would have made more money than ever before. ...and by that logic all the other altcoins as you can see gained so much....so i really don't wanna miss out
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:02:10
How much have you invested 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:05:50
Seee i have bought at 7800usd if it goes below that whole world is fucked...so question arises when and how much shouldi buy
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:26:06
Yeah i know...the thing is btc has the potential to go to 1million dollars or100k...so idgaf...i have spent my money that i can afford to lose so no problem at all
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:24:12
 
help needed urgent
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:22:10
But in the settings theres a option of import wallet
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:01:56
Yeah i know but btc isnt going anywhere it is staying as if it is a part of world
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:50:27
Like dracarys burns that twat from season 3
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:34:07

@_date: 2017-12-01 07:04:42
Which is the best place to store bitcoin?ledger nano?
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:39:29
See lets just not forget this type of opportunity doesnt come every once in a while...i didnt invest earlier...now i dont wanna miss anyhow. ..i guess my next investment will be in altcoins. ..bcos btc gain would not be much high...because to double my money it has to reach 30k which is idk possible in months or not
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:53:21
You bought altcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:00:15

@_date: 2017-12-07 07:24:38
There are many versions having size different ..can you send me a link or file size
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:56:42
Tbh if i had bought at 1000$ i would already made so much profit..at that stage too you would say no one can predict the future
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:13:02
Cant believe if i had bought in jan...1500% gain would have been made already
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:51:53
Where do you store it??a wallet or in exchange itself?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:49:58
I already made 100 percent profit i am retarded...then i would like to be called retarded
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:39:08

I live in India,can i use hola vpn to get account in gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:14:20
What he speaks so much about bitcoin and he fucking sold so many coins ..WHAT THE FUCK!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:10:04
So 5 transactions made close to 1 btc?how much you spent at each transaction 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:38:52
Bitcoin is volatile no one in their right mind would do that
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:45:46
who bought 14500??
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:13:34
But they both provide seed pass phrase..so even if phone gets stolen or corrupt ..btcs are safe ..am i right?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:28:50
Also mbtc are the new units
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:54:49
How many years have you been in this shit?��
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:15:57
So what's your exit strategy 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:44:06
When you trade like that...do you store btc in cold storage or mobile wallet ...and whats the least and most time period you did while buying and selling one btc...you made 6k...and you still think its less...6k in 2months that too on just trading is impressive 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:43:45
How much you have spent on btc
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:56:28
What about mycelium,breadwallet??
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:42:53
No my question was where exactly you store iota...i bought it from bitfinex...and they are still there ...so where should i keep it so that it remains safe 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:42:15
so we just have to make a rule...that is to store only in these types of wallet...so whoever comes will know it
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:20:49
There are limited number of blocks you cant just do that,if everyone would do that,no blocks would be left
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:20:19
So now i have 0.14 btc
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:44:38
What exactly are derivatives
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:39:39
yeah..actually i couldnt ,as i dont have any money on my name...so i have to invest using my dads money
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:44:57
Fuck you banks!your time is over!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:33:02
RIPPLE IS OUR SAVIOUR!BITCOIN IS JUST A TOOL LEFT 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:41:05

@_date: 2017-12-07 12:34:00
Well how much you have hodl
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:19:52

@_date: 2017-12-07 11:22:50

@_date: 2017-12-07 11:57:02
Also i have bought iota and kept it on bitfinex 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:21:03

Well FML
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:52:40
Fuck noobs!
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:47:58
But its selling at 13500$ so not a scam
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:13:10
I had bought some btcs at 7800..so i had thought that i should have bought 1 whole btc then i had made 10000 by now like in a month...i dont see how it could be a bad idea
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:11:25
Would it have been a great decision if i bought one btc at 11000 and sold now at 16000..and made profit of 5000 in almost 10 days
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:42:42
Every wallet must provide seed words,otherwise they are worthless
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:14:05
20k in 1 hour
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:34:58
What price did you buy and what is it now
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:57:27
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:19:21
But how can you say crash is going to occur even if it happens I bought at 7800 usd
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:52:53
I sent 5000 rupees to breadwallet but it shows 4180rs at the time it was received..why a loss of money is i dont get it..transfer rate causes so much loss then what is the solution
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:25:06
When did you buy what rate
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:48:49
Exactly he doesnt know btc rates differ country to country

@_date: 2017-12-07 12:04:25

@_date: 2017-12-07 12:00:47
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:56:48

Coinbase shows 17010 where r u seeing that amt
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:30:47
Are you planning to buy more ...whats your strategy to invest a little every week?
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:48:19
Which other altcoins you hold where do you store them...are there any wallets which secure cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:55:12
You keep your bitcoins in paper wallet only or other software wallets too...?
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:40:54
No i didn't buy...i wanted to but my dad wouldnt take risk....i wish i had bought 1 btc my profit would have been 1 btc 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:18:31
Why whats gonna happen after 10th
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:29:50
I think if bitcoin crashes,it will be the biggest crash in history of financial world
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:49:52
See if that happens “i will personally give you a blowjob for free”..
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:15:05
And also what i am actually trying to convey is that...i will keep on doing this ..like buy one btc every week or so and sell it probably in another week and keep on making it profit...ofcourse theres a chance that it may drop...but as we can see it always recovers
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:37:54
I can still buy 1 btc...but risks are too high ..so i am gonna buy a little every week or so..thats my strategy 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:55:53
After seeing that btc rose from 1000$ to 15000$...you still think that it wll crash your retarded
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:23:55
Why the f..k not ..so investment depends on future prices..so i am just predicting how can i make profit
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:47:55
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:56:08
i have my money on breadwallet...i want some of it in electrum...is it possible.by import/sweep or i just have to send btcs like a transaction

@_date: 2017-11-16 11:25:17
Mother fucking yeah!!!
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:06:45
It doesnt work like that in order to get bitcoin to reach this level you need to keep making transactions..otherwise everyone would just hold in order to get more money
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:04:51
My exchange doesnt do it ..and all my bitcoins are on that exchange what steps are there to do it?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:38:58
