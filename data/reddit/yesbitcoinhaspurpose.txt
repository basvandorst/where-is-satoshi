Propose a cheaper alternative...or stfu.
You honestly think there is going to EVER be a 0% remittance cost in the near future? Zero fees, zero conversion rate, getting local currency at the EXACT exchange rate?
Yeah, good luck with that. 
Some of the Bitcoiner "Do everything in Bitcoin...no fiat, ever!" is just an immature pipedream by people that have a fundamental lack of understanding of how the world actually functions.
So again, propose a cheaper alternative, or save your snarky replies for someone else.

Nah, Circle's price is always 1% more than Coinbase.
Even after the 1% fee, Coinbase is always at least a few cents cheaper than Circle with their "no fees".

Where are you seeing Backpage got Visa back on their website?
This isn't being reported anywhere else. Are you sure?

Fuck that. Adderall IR, bitches.

The only problem is Backpage has made all ads FREE.
A person will only need to actually pay for an ad if they want to move it to the top of the list, where it is more visible.
People will just use different email addresses to keep posting their ads for free.
Go try to post one now yourself...you'll see.

It's doesn't constitute as a money transmitter business for $500-$1000 worth of coins sold, for personal use, once a month, in order to circumvent ATM fees.
FinCEN would give zero fucks about this.

You act like "tumblers" aren't already compromised/ran by law enforcement.
