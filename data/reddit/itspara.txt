Can't edit, but The Internet Archive pays employees in bitcoin as well.

There's already a pirate party in the US. Pirates ran in the 2014 elections in two states.

How do you like bitpay so far? Also how are you handling the tax side of accepting Bitcoin? Does bitpay help with that?

We already have a pirate party, and its not too backwards.

Not really a white list. Think of it as the state telling them how they think the law applies to Bitcoin donations. Which is important because the state will generally enforce it along those lines.

Oh my, thats not good. I have no idea how that would have happened. You should have been able to get in touch with someone from the PNC at least. Anyways, thats the past. Sorry you didn't have much luck.

Theres also [Clear Channel]( and  [Lamar]( Both of which are pretty large and also have inventory in Times Square assuming if enough is raised for that. (Though I think a regular bitcoin ad would be best in that location, or any location really)

Doesn't mean there can't be any sex.

Independence party and the progressives don't have enough to form a government in their own though. So if the same people are to remain in power, they need to win support from another party, perhaps Revival.

Both of which you get with reddit more or less. Privacy policy says any data given to advertisers can't be used to identify you and I would say the ads are pretty non-intrusive.

Apparently it is not yet possible to pay babysitters with Bitcoin. XD
