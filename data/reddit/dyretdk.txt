Where do you have that fact from? I think as many merchants uses BitGo?


Like it is now?


Like, where have you been for the last six month? Bitcoin has dropped from $1100 to as I'm writing, to about $584 on btc-e, don't you think most merchant would be running right now? 


You concerns have been answered in so many threads here on the reddit, there is NO worry about 51% of hashing power,  it has been said in so many post, I'm surprised it can still be questioned.


Again, i can't stop thinking where you have these impressive numbers from? Not any reports I ever read.


Please stop confusing assumptions with facts, it will make the world a better place &lt;3


Bitcoin isn't for everyone, no one has ever said that? Don't make bitcoin in to be something it is not. What you are calling "no real advantage", is what everyone else is calling the future. Suppressed countries can trade free and secure from dictatorship, without "identifying them self to the merchant" as you write as it is bad? Bitcoin is definitely not for you if you don't see the advantages in your forth point.

People who can't buy a coca cola with normal currency? Traders? Just because he has 250 bitcoins, doesn't make it a smart choice for him if he do not see the advantages but just the disadvantages. If i owned 250 tires, but didn't see the potential advantages in them, the money i could make of them, how much worth are they to me? Same goes with bitcoin.. If you only can see the disadvantages, you won't make any money.. Then you could just invest in a windmill or something, because you'll be to busy being worried and looking for the wrong things.
