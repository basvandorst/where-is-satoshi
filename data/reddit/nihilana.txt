Dear gods, are you seriously that goddamn dense that you think I was comparing MYSELF to them and not giving an examples of people you definitely wouldn't judge based on career.

I think it's hilarious how completely out of context you're taking almost every comment made. At first I wasn't going to engage your trollish behavior but since everyone else did, I thought I'd indulge. It's almost cathartic.

Pizza Driver here, I really wouldn't mind getting a fourth or half of my tips in bitcoin, it'd save me the trouble of collecting part of my tip profits and buying it at the end of the week. I've thought about putting a bitcoin something or other on my uniform somewhere soon. A fourth to half would allow for enough USD for gas and maintenance.
Plus the whole appreciation in value thing. Though I think right now I think I maybe deliver to one person a month that *might* have some bitcoin.

'Terrible life choices' sums up some of my 40+ co-workers, but not someone who would otherwise be fresh out of college and recently rebuilding their life from scratch. 
Bitcoin is risky and I would never say otherwise unless it's been fully adopted, that said, there are people at my work, some younger, some older that have asked me about it and most are interested in a short gain and I've discouraged them from buying bitcoin altogether. Judging someone based on their job, not even their career or the events leading up to their situation, is at best insulting.
Plato, and Socrates were teachers, Jesus of Nazareth was a carpenter (not even going to begin debating the merits of religion here merely pointing out the affect of the individual) to even BEGIN getting an idea of someone's character, knowledge or wisdom based on profession is probably one of the worst ways I can think of.

bought some earlier at around 500, will be here in a week, I meant to buy them 3-4 months ago and heavily regret it. I can't wait to see what this week brings and what they're worth when I actually have them in my wallet(s).
