You don't need state for that

I see where you're coming from, I just think you haven't given enough time to the thought of a society with no taxes.
You know who can do better roads than a shitty government? Someone who will lose money if roads are not good enough. You know who will get you the best and cheapeast healtchare? Someone who will go bankrupt if they don't provide it to you.
You know why we get shitty roads and expensive healtchare? Because we're forced at "jailpoint" to pay for it either way, the money is still there.
Imagine taxes are gone tomorrow. Who will take care of the road outside your home. Nobody, correct? The road will degrade, it'll start looking bad, and someone will come up with the brilliant idea of fixing it up for you. How much will you pay for it? The minimum. Why? Because if that guy's charging too much, someone will come and realize he can do it cheaper. And what's the quality you'll get? The best for the price.
Will the rich live in their own bubble and slowly let the poor die? Poor people exist because the cost of living is too high with respect to income. Life is way more expensive than it should be, because of state and economic inefficiences, and salaries are lower than they are because of taxes. With this you get the best salaries for everyone. If you're not earning enough to live that means you're not providing enough value to society and you need to do something else. Then again, this situation is less likely because you'll be earning more (due to competition), and you'll be paying less.
If you think taxes help the poor, I disagree. Tax is a way to redistribute "wealth". The higher the tax, the more the equality but you massively downsize the size of the cake, so everyone's now poor, great.

Because it's true?

Why the fuck would you want public services, when they're the most inefficient form of a business you can have? Your money can do way, way, way more than you think, but you have asshats spending in the shittiest way.
Do you really think you need taxes for public roads? Would you be willing to pay someone to fix the roads if they started degrading? If yes, that's your answer. If no, then you're ok with shitty roads, and that's fucking perfect, because you're saving money which otherwise would be wasted.

What government? :)
@_date: 2019-07-30 05:41:46
Some guy forcing me to hand him part of the value I produce is not theft? And with every single thing I purchase?
Can you think of a more inefficient way of spending money than spending others' money in others? (whch is what a state does)

But you'll eventually sell the gold for fiat and that's when you'll pay...

Plus the time you'd need to group them up or getting someone to accept then for something you want to buy.

You do realize that corruption is inherent to the big ass state?

EDIT: I misunderstood your question. Yes, a wallet is essentially just a collection of keys (think something like 123874zcsd713asd). With a seed, you can generate this collection of keys (which is the "wallet"). If you create a different wallet, then a different seed is such that it's able to regenerate these different keys.
@_date: 2019-05-06 02:44:54
When you set up the wallet you'll be provided with a seed, which is a 12 or 24 word phrase. You can then use that seed to restore your wallet.

Your seed is never supposed to ever touch the digital world. So, no matter what, a hacker will never have access to your seed. It can't practically be brute-forced either so, as long as your seed is stored safely, your money is safe.
@_date: 2019-05-06 03:25:53
When you send bitcoin you're not showing your seed to anyone. The seed allows you to regenerate this set of keys, which serve the role of proof of ownership of your coins. When you send bitcoin, you create a transaction that is signed (yes, digitally signed) using this key. You never show this key to anyone either, you show the signature. This signature has the property that it can be verified by anyone that you effectively have access to the funds without you having to give them your key.
So, your seed you keep safe with you, never show it to anyone, you never tell anyone what method you're using to store it, and that's about it. To make a transaction, your hardware wallet will ask you for a pin (which you created), and it will know which keys to use to make the transaction happen. The seed is used in case you lose access to the device, or when you want to use another wallet, for example.
EDIT: I misunderstood your question again, sorry. In any case, what I wrote above holds.
What you actually store aren't coins, I think that's where the confusion is coming from. If you're really interested in understanding why it's safe and why it works and why such weird things can't happen, then you really need to read up. Otherwise, just please trust that it works and it's safe.

Totally, and from the link provided:






That sounds like a **really** bad weakness.
@_date: 2019-05-06 02:57:03
Yes. Also, it's not a hardware device-specific thing, or a seed that will work specifically with one brand: [ You'll be able to use your seed to restore a software wallet if you want. What you actually store are not  "coins", you should probably read up on that as it'd be a rather long explanation.

So this is when you take advantage and start things that cost a few cents for a full dollar.

When you use \`sendpayment\`  you need to provide a payment request.
