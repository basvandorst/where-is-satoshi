Roger ver is the Mark Karpelès of bitcoin and crypto. The later responsible for the great crash of 2014. Hope Roger won't cause a great crash of 2017. He just needs to let bitcoin cash die.

If 80% of miners switch, 51% attack is more likely with the btc chain.

It will drop after fork or a bit before. There's a lot of uncertainty during that time period and BCH is getting an update. If BCH becomes more profitable to mine, there will be uncertainty.

The only way it will crash 75% is major FUD like China or regulations. I believe the alt coin market is holding BTC this high but if BTC crashes it then BTC also has chance to go down a lot as many people use BTC for alts.

Just HODL all or if you want to gamble, sell off BTC as most likely it will dump then watch what happens.
If 51% attack or only 15% miners of BTC core then expect transactions to be slow with high fees. People become more aware of BTC core issues.
BCH may even win or they all lose and crypto enters bear market for awhile.

Not if 51% attack happens. It is a possibility if someone has 51% of the mining power. They can decide which transactions gets approved and can double spend. I'd be concerned if miners switch to another chain.

Watch out for some major FUD coming up. I am betting after 2x it'll drop back to 5000s.

My coworkers laughed and said it was play money. I even had dinner with some friends who said it's just fake money.
The real losers are the ones holding USD while it's decreasing in value.

When friends that buying btc and it hits front news, that tells me it will probably dip. BTC went from $6000 to $5000. I'd expect a correction back down to low $6000 soon.
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:35:53
I hope this is another dump so we can buy more cheap coins.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:49:01
This is why it is risky to sell low. You don't know when the reversal is going to happen unless you are there within the very minutes it happens. When it goes up, it will go up really fast. I wouldn't be surprised if it goes up to 4000 tomorrow if this is truly the reversal.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:12:34
It's going up....can't say for sure but min to min chart shows &gt; $3100 now. FOMO now activated. You know the saying buy on rumor and sell on news? Reverse of this is sell on bad rumor and buy on release of the bad news
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:16:15
If he did not give us the news, we would've only had FUD x1 instead of FUD x2. My take is that it wouldn't have dropped as much if he just remained silent.
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:48:29
I don't plan to buy anymore until sub $5000.

I think $3000 is the bottom for btc and around $200 for eth. No more FUD anymore. It dipped a little below $3000 but $3000 should be the floor.
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:12:38
I think it will be stuck for awhile between $5000-6000.
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:12:25
Should we expect a correction back to sub $5000? It did go up too fast the past few days.

I think this is going to 6k next week. After fork, you will see a sale off most likely.
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:14:58
$6000 end of this month!

I suspect someone had hacked your e-mail and was monitoring your activities. The weakest link is your phone number. It is an easy hack. Check your phone company and see if someone tried to call and temporary gain access to your phone number by pretending to be you.
They then can hack your gmail.
If your phone company did indeed give someone else access to your phone number, then I suggest getting a lawyer and sue your phone company for damages.

I believe the reversal just happened. Can't say for sure it's really it but that is one big green candle

Even with electricity I am still profiting. You won't get ROI for a few months though. Use Nicehash.

I think this week $5000 is likely then news goes to worldwide and BTC goes to $5500+. If news include the "free money" details of the fork, it will drive the price even higher.
@_date: 2017-09-23 04:50:00
I'd go all in if it went that low.
@_date: 2017-10-15 08:53:25
Never. It will never burst again. There will be corrections and big FUD to bring it down 50% or so but if it survived the China ban without a crash, I don't see it happening.
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:31:43
I think it may be tomorrow or later this week. $5000 has a lot of resistance.

They can try but they can't. It is a decentralized network. They can block centralized networks but not decentralized.
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:08:28
I have a feeling this is the big dip that drops $1000 then goes back up. I could be wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:30:37
The next great crash. I'd say it will dip under $5000.

In 2030, 1 BTC = 1 House

The amount of stupidity in that article amazes me. It says gold doesn't need electricity to trade but we'd have to go to some physical location to trade it. Bitcoin's ease of trading is an advantage. Nowadays electricity is very easily accessible.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:42:46
There's a lot of sell orders around $5000 mark but after that the sell orders are thinner. So if it breaks $5000, it can easily go to $5300-5500. Similar to how there was a lot of buy orders around $3000 mark when bitcoin was falling.

i think we should sue the US government.
