That's not entirely true, we simply don't have physical coins representing $0.001. Transactions do occur at these and lower levels though. Think about gas prices ($3.999/gallon) or currency exchange rates. Plenty of dollars are transacted at thousandths of a dollar.

Over the weekend I attempted to integrate Bitcoin into a stock eCommerce platform to see how well it took. The first major problem was do I price in USD and show an exchange rate, or do I price in Bitcoin and have a bunch of goods for 0.001? (eBooks are cheap.) Major hurdle: everything is configured for two decimal places. I added an on-the-fly currency converter so all prices would change dynamically depending on the currency, but 99 cent purchases all came up as 0.00 - not enough decimal places.
After some testing, I kept hearing that people wanted the prices in BTC, so back I went and did that. The cheapest possible thing I can sell is 0.01BTC, which at today's exchange is over a dollar.
Therefore, for mainstream use, we merchants _need_ Bitcents _yesterday_. As the value climbs, and it will, I won't be able to reprice anything lower. (Second major problem will be - for a while - repricing inventory weekly, daily, hourly, who knows?)
All currency converters are going to show two decimal places. All eCommerce platforms are going to show two decimal places. No-one is going to invest in refactoring hundreds of thousands of lines of code to "play" with Bitcoin.
Check out what I managed to get done:  - not at all ready for prime time but there is a currency converter lower right that will give you an idea of how it could work.

Then why not just dump 1 coin into the pot, call it 21 million coins, and start dividing? Why all the lengthy mining? Why is there a need to wait for the pool of value tokens to be filled up? Surely if we didn't have the introduction of new portions of the pre-agreed pot of infinitely divisible tokens, we'd have little to no speculation?
(Edit: in your examples, gold hasn't gone, merely it's tradeable value has diminished due to its inaccesibility by humans who perceive value. That gold can be re-acquired. Lost Bitcoins are gone for good.)
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:57:34
So to me that means that there aren't 21 million Bitcoins. There are instead an infinite number of infinitely divisible value tokens, the smallest number of which is 21 million tokens. Is that a reasonable understanding?

Surely this is conflating the currency with the accounting system. By the same logic, the intrinsic value of the dollar includes the banks and computer systems they use to keep the accounts.

OK, I'll bite one more time.

You already said that (currency).


So the coin, the client, and the network are all the same, one thing? I disagree.


My bitcoin is stored on US soil. How is it an offshore account?




Conceptual philosophies do not intrinsic value make.
You still have not countered my argument. Either the system is part of the alleged intrinsic value, and therefore the dollar has greater intrinsic value than bitcoin, or the currency is the only part in question, and neither the dollar nor bitcoin have any intrinsic value, at least so little to be worthless.

Here: I've set decimals to three places. Go to  and in the lower right change the default currency from BTC to anything you like. Now look at the prices. Now tell an existing merchant that this is OK. 
Me, I have no problem with this. I have no shipping, no taxes. But there is no doubt that this will unnerve customers. We could refactor every eCommerce package, add in conditional code to account for the currency, all sorts of things. Or, we could change the base unit of currency, as proposed, to Bitcent (or similar) which would instantly solve the issue. Magic!
The proposal above is that the base unit being valued at over $100 is too high for mainstream customers. I am providing a real world example to back this up.

I would, but I don't have a currency converter that I know that counts mBTC as a unit. I need to update the prices on the fly given the up and down on the exchange rates, so whoever is supplying me exchange rates needs to supply mBTC as a unit of currency. All I can get is BTC for now.
I already started working on a display that will simply _show_ mBTC and I'll go from there.

Boy, these online opinions are _easy_.


No. You are not. You are buying municipal services. Assessed at the value of your real property.
Rent is hiring. Buying is owning. Paying taxes is neither buying property nor renting property. If your house is your only asset, and if you owe a lienholder money, they may come for your only asset, but this does not mean you don't own the thing they want. More to the point, if you didn't own it, they wouldn't have to come ask you for it.
Not paying your property tax does not confer ownership.
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:34:53
I would have to change it in three places: the shop, the commission software, and the currency converter. Assuming ten minutes each I'd be happy to consider hiring you for the 30 minutes it takes to change it. 
Then when any of those three packages are updated, I assume they will break the changes and I'll need to do it again. And again. And again.
And when BTC goes from $100 to $1000 I'll need to change it again. 
And when customers switch from BTC to USD/EUR/Whatever display using a currency display converter I assume I'll have prices like $2.89273645.
None of this includes a store that also takes other currency and has plugins or gateways to shipping calculators, payment processors, the myriad other things stores do with prices.
I'm sure you effected the change in ten minutes, but as someone who's been in Web development since the 90s I'd point out that in my humble experience no change takes ten minutes, and all changes are a new problem to shepherd and pay for down the road. If it's not part of the core code to change precision, you are going to run into additional problems unless you review the entire codebase; those prices are going to be rounded up who knows where else. More to the point, I wanted to see how a stock platform felt dealing with Bitcoin. My experience should replicate a non-expert developer setting up generally easy-to-use software.
The first sentence of my comment did not read "this is an impossible problem". I was clear that I attempted to use stock software and relayed my experience. I'd be curious to see your Magento store, could you post a link?

Very cool Web site, but I think there are a few key differences. The main difference is that BitBooks is intended to be a marketplace for authors, so I won't be personally selling eBooks, instead I'll be allowing authors to self publish using the marketplace. This will (hopefully) stimulate some Bitcoin adoption by even more people. Secondly, I won't be carrying eBooks I don't have the right to. It appears to me the site you linked is simply buying Amazon eBooks for money and selling them for BTC. Quite a different business model.

@_date: 2013-05-07 18:09:12
Well, I think it's less about ownership and more about property. I own my property. I own my bitcoin. 
If someone were to enter my real property, even though they have possession I can have them removed. I have title.
If someone were to take my personal property - my bitcoin - that possession would be enough for them to prove ownership. I would have no recourse as I have no title.
It's far-fetched to try and draw parallels between real and personal property.

@_date: 2013-04-23 12:07:49
No worries man, nothing personal I know :o) But I think you're missing the point still. 


In a simple deployment of one eCommerce package this may be true. But once you introduce plugins, shipping, third-party payment gateways, and any number of rounding going on for various display and your price is going to be acted upon by code and people out of your control. They will be expecting two decimal places.
I could quickly extend the price variable in the underlying database to store 16 decimals if I wanted to, and edit the appropriate form that captures this price to ensure it validates. But this price is going to be acted upon by many, many functions, hidden away inside anything from tens to hundreds of thousands of lines of code, depending on the software being used.
My point is a real world application issue: adoption of Bitcoin by existing merchants is going to meet resistance because of the decimal place issue. The overwhelming vast majority of them are going to be serving customers in first world currencies that are precise to two, maybe three decimal places. 
The math and the code is not the issue. The psychology of changing an entire Web site to accommodate a new currency is the issue.

Paying taxes assessed on the value of your home does not negate your ownership. There are parts of the world without property taxes. You do not own your house "more" due to a lack of taxation. 
Those taxes are intended for communal services, not ownership. If you choose to live in a place that assesses taxes, and you choose not to pay those taxes, your possessions may be attached for default. These evil gummint forces could just as easily place a lien on your bitcoin holdings.
Being able to hide assets is not the same as freedom from taxation. And there are plenty of us who pay our taxes on our gains.

Excellent insight and something I really, really wanted. I tried various ways of having the store be entirely in Bitcoin prices, but the issues I came up against again and again are being limited to two decimal places. It is going to take some work to undo the built-in notion that money has two decimals.
What I have right now is a plugin that allows you to choose any currency you want, all prices are dynamically displayed in your currency. So, you can set it to Bitcoin. Problem is, most prices then end up being 0.00 as the prices are, in fact, 0.001 or 0.005 or something.
I am working on it, I really want the thing to be in Bitcoin only. Hopefully I'll get there.

Just because the US doesn't have _universal_ socialised medicine, doesn't mean it doesn't have _any_ socialised medicine.

Oh yeh, the math is simple, implementation is not :o) I'm using Preev to get exchange rates, and a plugin to allow users to switch between currencies. Until mBTC is an "official" currency then no commercial software is going to be set up for it. So I'd either have to reverse hack the shopping cart, the marketplace and the exchange rate software, or sit tight til it becomes normal for mBTC to be a unit of currency.
I'm playing with a few tweaks now to see if I can make it work, but I'm not sure mBTC is clear enough to enough people yet to just run with it.
I agree though, I want BTC pricing, not USD, not EUR. I'll keep plugging away at a fix.
