Are the max amounts written in the lease? Since the landlord is covering utilities, establish a summer and winter baseline in the lease. Anything over a certain amount is the tenant’s responsibility. 
Either that or the thermostat is set at certain points for each season (published in the lease) and tenants have no control over it. But landlord also is not changing it willy billy based in the bill. This is what dormitories do.
Simply being able to change it whenever you want equates to being able to barge into my home unannounced. It’s an odd situation, I’ll give you that- somewhat borders between physical and digital privacy.

Can’t blame you for any of those except Thanos. It’s Disney- of course the good guys are going to ultimately win.

I wouldn’t be comfortable as a tenant at a place where the landlord has access to to appliances and devices. Did they not ask how to set them up for their own control? Wouldn’t they see that someone else is also set up to control them?

Nah. He said his electricity bill is $1300, bit $1000. 
WE ARE PROVIDED:
Expenses: $1300/mo expenses. 
Profit: $5-10per day *30 days = $150-300/mo profit (assume 300 for simplicity)
SOLVE FOR REVENUE: 
Profit = Revenue - Expenses
$300 = Revenue - $1300
Revenue = $1600
He must make bringing in $1600 according to the post. If Henry’s revenue drops below $300, there will not be enough watermelon to share as the cake can only be divided into that many pieces.
