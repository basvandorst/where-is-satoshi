Maybe it depends on the region? I've seen reports of both success and failure.

Yes coinbase requires that you submit id such as drivers license or passport in order to use their services.

It might work but it also might not. Prepaid cards worked for me on coinbase but others have reported failure. Also it's perfectly fine to give coinbase your id.

Wrong, after you've submitted id, they will let you use prepaid. I've done it before.

If they keep making their fraud crypto at the same rate, possibly

Bitcoin: A peer to peer electronic CASH system

Except BCH is becoming less and less irrelevant. The gap is closing between the 2

Let me rephrase myself:
By that time bitcoin will likely be replaced by something far better, produced by a large company since they have the manpower and resources to do so, hell it might even be the governement that does so. If crypto takes over, the elite wont let it be a decentralized one.

Until bitfenix prints out more tether

By the time crypto takes over fiat, bitcoin wont even exist, there will be something better likely made by a large corporation

Just "nope", not even gonna provide any evidence?

Thats complete fake news dude, its literally just the bch site copy pasted, and nobody has ever even heard of it

While it is true Roger is manipulating the bcash market, he doesnt even make up 5% of the 3 billion+ volume. Meanwhile more and more people are getting intrested in it

1) Your absolutely right, scummy people are behind bcash
2) While it is true that the cashening failed, this coin isnt slowly bleeding out like people though it would, meaning it has investors that believe in the project.
3) Its absolutely NOT a pump and dump, but rather a banker control over bitcoin. Jihan and Roger arent here to make a quick dollar, they WANT to win.
4) While its true many people hate it, support for the project is only growing, alongside the price. Unless you can provide a link bitcoin cash + is complete fake news. Bitcoin Cash hard forked to implement ADA.
5) Nothing new is coming for bitcoin except LN which is 18 months away

What im trying to say is that more and more people are buying into bcash and it could become a serious problem for btc. Simply brushing it off like a non-issue would be stupid
