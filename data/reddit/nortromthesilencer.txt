Ive never been charged for transferring money between accounts at a bank.

And there's the fallacy fallacy. Pointing out logical fallacies doesn't make you look smart, and it DEFINITELY doesn't make you right. In this case, having a long measured record of success is very important, and absolutely proves his point.

That's a very good common definition of money, but the economic definition is something that can be used as a store of value, a uniy of account, and most importantly a medium of exchange. Crypto, like pokemon cards, is can not be used as a medium of exchange. I also don't know why you went on a long rant about 'value' when that has nothing to do with the topic at hand

Your lack of economic understanding becomes more evident with every post. There isn't much more to say here, it's clear you've been indoctrinated.

If you can't see the delusion in what you just posted given the path that crypto has taken these past few years then I really can't help you man. It's a terrible store of value given its tremendous volatility and it's a terrible medium of account and unit of exchange for the same reason. As time has gone on Bitcoin's utility has only decreased, and the millions of fragmented and forked altcoins out there don't paint an optimistic view of cryptos ever becoming a viable currency.

It hasn't taken any 'market share' because crypto isn't a currency. It's like saying Apple or oil futures have taken away USD's 'market share'.

Go take econ 101, or read the definition of money. Because currency isn't "two things we agree to trade". Pokemon cards are not currency. They are not a medium of exchange.
