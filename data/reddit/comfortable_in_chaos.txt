Monetary inflation means a fall in the purchasing value of a currency, regardless of the supply of that currency. 
Bitcoin has historically been extremely *deflationary*. That is, the purchasing value has skyrocketed.

Even if that were true, who cares? 
Crypto can still be a wildly profitable investment in the meantime.

The overall trajectory is still positive. The price is still well above where it was a year ago, and far higher than two years ago. Yes, it's volatile. Yes, it's risky. Yes, it's not for everyone. But there are plenty of good reasons to invest in it too.

The purchasing power of Dollars will only go down, because dollars are inflationary. 
The purchasing power of Bitcoin will only go up, because bitcoin is deflationary. 
If I'm going to buy something at the store today, I might as well use dollars. If I want to store my money to use it later, I'm probably better off using Bitcoin.

The USA has paid more than triple this figure for a single airplane. I don't think this matters much.

Competition *is* good, and there are hundreds of bitcoin forks that are innovating and doing great things. Nobody's upset about that. 
The resentment has come from the fact that Ver has repeatedly and conspicuously misrepresented BCH as Bitcoin. He has also attempted to directly undermine Bitcoin by manipulating its price, transaction fees, and hashrate.
