Lmao. Oh yeah. I can see that Bitcoin is the future of currency.

Speculators are not investors.

Google wasn't a public company in 1999. In fact, it was a year old lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:44:58
You used an appreciating asset to pay for a consumable?  Why?
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:41:30
Yeah and four years later people lost their shirts when the Internet bubble burst. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:34:26
Right?  MySpace and AltaVista and Value America are all leaders in their field because they were among the first movers. It means a lot!
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:08:38
Exactly. A worthless digital token that you can't spend anywhere and has virtually zero adoption and is garnering nothing but negative connotations for normies. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:26:07
Bated. Unless you're hooking a worm on your breath. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:37:58
Bullshit. How would that even work?  If you bought a car yesterday Bitcoin has dropped like $2000 in that time so how much was your car?
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:42:30
You're delusional if you think any of this will happen in our lifetimes or if it would play out the way you think. Regardless, Bitcoin itself won't be part of the story. That I can guarantee. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:36:33
In 100 years quantum computing will have made Bitcoin absolutely worthless. Guaranteed. No one will be using digital binary computers. Bitcoin will be long forgotten. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:55:37
Why?  The secondary market is about to be flooded with slightly used cards. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:33:02
You are absolutely nuts if you think Bitcoin will be worth anything if fiat gets fucked. I'll take gold, silver, canned goods, and ammo but you can stuff your shitcoin right up your candy ass. It's worthless.

Actual adoption will be tough when Google, Twitter, and Facebook have even banned *ads* for crypto. Lol.

8800--&gt;1800--&gt;720--&gt;100 is a downward trend. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:09:17
What fundamentals?  Lol. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:49:22
It didn't take off in the US. It was a success worldwide. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:42:47
Ledgers have existed since the beginning of writing. Where is the revolutionary part?
@_date: 2018-04-09 10:56:37
Your government accepts taxes in Bitcoin?  Why keep it a secret?  Just tell us where you live. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:43:12
Then Satoshi would be a trillionaire several times over. It doesn't make sense. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:03:22
And we'll look back at Bitcoin and laugh just like we're laughing at this ad. As for Blockchain, what technology?  It's a ledger. They've existed since the invention of the written word.
