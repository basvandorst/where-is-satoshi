You still have to pay taxes on money to acquired illegally. The IRS can't report you to another agency for it. Just write it in on the "other" line and pay what you owe.

Ignoring the laws is not protesting against them. If you use marijuana in a state where marijuana is illegal, you will be arrested. That is not a protest. That is being an idiot. If you want to change things, talk to the people who have the power to change things.
That being said, pushing for Bitcoin to be regulation-free is directly contradictory to the goal of being taken seriously as a currency. Real currencies have regulations, laws, and limitations.

Someone has the power to claw back your money *if you're a merchant*. That's the point of consumer protection laws (to protect consumers, obviously). No one likes the risk of a chargeback but people hate getting scammed even more.
And I'm willing to take that risk and continue using my dirty fiat as is my wont.
@_date: 2014-08-03 07:52:43
Merchants pay it, so they pass the cost on to you. Things would be 2% cheaper if that fee didn't exist.

We can't have checks. That would be _centraliziation_, and that's evil.
@_date: 2014-08-17 08:26:02
That's the point of a chargeback: expediency. If a consumer buys something, but the merchant doesn't follow through on their part of the deal, they would have to go through this third party (be it a court or "escrow service") and have them review the case (and if everyone is doing these types of deals, it's probably going to take a while). It's just too much of a hassle for small purchases, so people probably wouldn't bother (not to mention that in this glorious free market, an escrow service would probably have to charge a fee to stay in business). For large purchases, well, we already have courts for that. Chargebacks are  an expedient way around this. If the merchant scams you, you use a chargeback to get your money back. If the merchant didn't actually scam you but you used a chargeback anyways, that's illegal, and they can take you to court over it. But they probably won't bother because it takes time and money, and only makes sense for a large purchase. Chargebacks are just a consumer-friendly solution to this problem, while escrow services are merchant-friendly.

But don't proclaim that a lack of chargebacks is a great feature of Bitcoin. You can't say "it's great that we don't have it," and then if people tell you that it's not actually that great, say "BUT WE CAN HAVE IT IF WE WANT." Sure, it can be added - but Bitcoin is being used as a mechanism of trade, like it or not, and should be judged as such.

You're sending a large amount of money to a company that exchanges money for a currency that, as far as they're concerned, is used for drugs and other illegal activities. It's pretty obvious how that can look suspicious. 
(Obviously, Bitcoin is used for other things - but banks would rather be cautious than in trouble, and they're not going to gamble on something that appears to them to be risky.)

Different situations, different laws. 
If I use Uber or Lyft instead of a taxi, all I care about is whether the person will get me there on time in one piece with all my belongings. I don't care about their personal sanitation. I can piece together a good opinion of the person by how they present themselves and their online reviews.
With restaurants, it's different. I don't know what's going on in the kitchen. I don't know what's going on at the meat packing plant. I don't know if it's sanitary. I can't figure that out unless I went in and investigated the kitchen or the plant myself. That's what the government does.
When I go to a friend's house and eat food with him, I know what kind of person they are. If they're the kind of person who knows how to cook, cooks food safely, and understands the basics of sanitation. If I go to some guy's apartment who I don't know and buy food from him, and there's no one to certify that his food is safe, that's dangerous. In many ways.

It's merchant-friendly because it's difficult for the consumer to challenge a transaction and win. Chargebacks are consumer-friendly because the consumer has the power to say "the merchant has not fulfilled their part of this transaction" and not have to go through a tiresome process to do so.

It's not tinfoil until you get some psuedoevidence that you can use to back up your claims.

That's not what underground means.

Just don't. The blockchain isn't meant for this.

No, we're not a cult. I'm serious guys!

People place a certain trust in public restaurants that they don't in random people in their apartments.

Since you seem to think that AMEX without chargebacks would be better for merchants and consumers than AMEX with chargebacks, yeah, you said something like that.

The fact that you're commenting on a thread about chargebacks, opposing my post saying that chargebacks are good?

Stealing is defined as "take (another person's property) without permission or legal right and without intending to return it."

Depends on the company and type of card (credit/debit). Either way, you're still paying for that 2% one way or another.

When you join a society, a tacit agreement is made. You agree to obey the laws that have been created, as long as everyone else does. If you don't obey a law because you think it's immoral, there's no reason other people should obey laws that they think are immoral; whether or not their idea of morality is the same as yours.

If losing your customers is a benefit to merchants, then sure.

If a company is spending more money because they have to pay a fee to the credit card company, they will raise prices. That's what it means by "pass the fee on," and yeah, you have to pay it no matter what the method of payment is, but that's not a counter-argument.

Why don't you try running a business without complying to the laws of the countries you're running it in. See how that goes.

Hoarding doesn't help Bitcoin at all. An economy doesn't survive when no one spends.

Conservative means purposely low for the sake of caution.

If he knew that the money was obtained through illegal means, but still agreed to make the transaction - that's money laundering. It doesn't matter who offered, it's still illegal. This is like when a cop buys drugs from a drug dealer and people scream "entrapment" when the dealer is arrested.

But that only includes the Germans. Many more people pronounce "S" as "S" than pronounce "ß" as "S" (or who have a ß character in their language).

Bank accounts are insured by FDIC for $250,000, and more than that by DIF. But regulation is bad, the government shouldn't help anyone.
The only people a move to Bitcoin would hurt are the poor and middle classes. The rich have all their money tied up in assets that are worth the same in USD and Bitcoin. The poor and middle class are the ones whose life savings would be destroyed if any move took place.
