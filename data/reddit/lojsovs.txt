This all just popped into your mind? ( i am amazed since im a dush at decorating)
@_date: 2019-07-14 13:31:44
Nice suggestions so far tho ��

I must be retarded. I don't get it.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:29:38
I sure will :)

Do you think a used seat ibiza would do the trick?
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:31:48
I would have to shoot down the planes for that... 
A display is a must. Should it go on the roof?
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:43:55
wow. Scary reading. Read up on some history. Will do you good.

You just summed up the past 6 years of my life (with a girl. Im a man)
@_date: 2019-07-09 09:04:02
It will hit 20k this year (probably within a few months, if not this one). 100k in a year and 1mio within 4 years. I have been in this game since 2012 and believe you me, this is the big one. This time bitcoin WILL go to moon.

HAHAHA!!! LOL!

awesome. Definitely gonna look more into the cladding thing. thank you!

Has nothing to do with security.

Aaaaaahhhh!! That is a swell idea!

you are either dumb or trolling.

Money = credit today. Banks create credit so they create money.

It was good times back in 09-14 when grown ups where occupying the space. Nobody asked simple dumb questions because the media had not yet infected the minds with FUD. No convo ever started with "bitconi is a ponzi", and back then you would have a better reason to suspect that.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:30:50
Sounds good. I will. thx!
@_date: 2019-07-16 07:02:01
awesome suggestion. I will go for that!
@_date: 2019-07-08 09:19:32
security is the reason. All other aspects of the programming part can be applied through sidechains. Ethereum fucked up by forcing a reorg. Bitcoin never did that and will never do.
@_date: 2019-07-16 07:00:50
gray. With a big logo on the side it might actually work.

A mass exodus of bitcoiners to the same small country (greenland or something) creating a democratic majority. We would just change the laws to be "Bitcoin as the only form of legal tender"... You think we could gather 60k people? Then we could make it happen.
@_date: 2019-07-30 16:50:50
I would move there. I bet iceland will be the first country to make such a move.

Make a private key by flipping a coin 260 times and withdraw the btc from coinbase to a tumbler ending on your freshly created address. 
Don't support the state. It is an evil centralized organisation. Support decentralization. That is the revolution offered by blockchain.
@_date: 2019-07-08 22:07:27
a few supercomputers? Do you even have the slightest idea of what you are talking about?

Some of Even the smartest bankers does not understand the process of money creation. You can study economics all day long. If your books are wrong and outdated, so will you be. 
Today we have the internet, which means that education/school is no longer the fastes way to get smart. For the dumb people not being able to do their own research, education is necessary. To them it is the only way to aquire new knowledge, and this puts them way behind people who spends all day searching the internet. Guided education is slow and therefor, the ones who skip school to do research on their own  has a major advantage. Old people do not get this and typically milionairs are old and have long educations.

uuuuh. nice! thx!

100k sat to 1 btc? 100 mio that is. She understands the basics but is no andreas. Nice to have women in the space tho :)
@_date: 2019-08-26 08:27:05
How do people get smarter? By being challenged. By being forced to understand bitcoin they will get smarter. By your suggestion, they will get dumber.
@_date: 2019-08-04 22:53:05
Aaaaand we just did.

What machine?

Your private key is the thing to hold on to. It is your access to our funds. With that you can generate your public key. So you can go from private to public key but not from public to private key. 
You can encrypt your private key in any way you want to. Using a 12 seed passphrase is very popular and effective. That would be a good idea. 
You should hold your bitcoin for a couple of years. When it goes to 300k (if it does within the next couple of years), sell it and rebuy when it is below 100k again. For the long term you should have bitcoin. It will be more valuable.
@_date: 2019-10-02 03:49:48
what is the problem?
@_date: 2019-06-09 13:30:39
@_date: 2019-06-04 12:36:07
Just wait. 
As long as your transaction is part of the mempool it is all good. 
As you see here:  [ there is a lot of transactions waiting to get confirmed/included in a block. The ones who payed the highest fee gets included first. 
If you didn't make an rbf transaction there is not much more to do than wait.
@_date: 2019-10-02 03:56:35
When you make a transaction, using bitcoin core wallet, it creates a new address and thereby a new private key, and sends the remaining bitcoin to that address and stores it in a new wallet.dat file. If you delete that you have no way of recovering your remaining bitcoin. Its that simple. Just like you thought.
@_date: 2019-06-09 13:39:47
Its Bitcoin anno 2012 all over.
@_date: 2019-10-02 04:13:54
It should be confirmed now.
@_date: 2019-06-12 10:52:58
ok. Cool. Will try that. Thx!
@_date: 2019-06-12 10:56:58
The teenage socialists .. Why are you even in bitcoin land?
@_date: 2019-06-14 20:00:07
So, 350k is the next target?
@_date: 2019-06-11 20:53:30
I used my bitcoin address as a password. Perhaps you did the same.

You see how fees are 1/10 even though transactions amount is the same as in dec 2017?
@_date: 2019-06-09 13:25:08
Money is just a very liquid asset. An asset could be gold or a debt obligation. In order for the state not to be able to print money ad libitum, an independant legal entity is controlling the money creation. Money here being a prommessary note created by the fed, and backed by the debt obligation/asset created by the treasury. 
Because money is generally defined so broad, the government defines it as "legal tender". So money is legal tender. Or; whatever the government says is money, is money. 
The confusion often comes from the fact that people go by different definitions of the term "money" (most don't really have one). 
The problem with the system is not money being backed by debt (obligation to pay). The problem is that the state only accepts taxes paid in one form of money/debt created by the state and its collaborators (the fed).

No bitcoin wallet will do kyc. Nobody will know your age. No worries.

You cannot owe bitmex money. No matter how violent the price moves. You are trading contracts so its a separate market.

t will start to pick up when volatility returns.

You can reuse an address as much as you like. You are just more anonymous when you use new addresses all the time.
