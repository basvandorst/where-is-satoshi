Did you just ask someone to donate $5,600 to you?

Nice! I just uploaded 9 of my most popular tracks from Soundcloud.  Here's hoping you enjoy original video game music!

Also, you're kind of mean for stealing my submission to the Microsoft support page from my original thread and relinking it here as your own original submission without even notifying me.  No big deal, but still.

Well played, sir. I laughed.

Apparently it's just the signature of the virus, not the virus itself.  Just for shits and giggles.
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:02:18
Thanks. I agree. Half the people knowing they are shit isn't good enough -- everyone needs to know.

Sounds good. I'll do it, thanks.  It sucks; I initially sold BTC, converted to USD, and now I'll need to re-buy BTC at a crappier rate, withdraw it, go to ANOTHER exchange, and sell there.  I'm losing a shit ton of money in the process just trying to turn this BTC to cash.

Apparently it's only short pieces of text/code, so it's not like you could write a full-on virus and have it go through and affect everyone on the blockchain.

wonder why the whole subreddit isn't experiencing this,

Hi, I'm the creator of that Microsoft discussion thread and I originally posted a similar thread on reddit last night.  I think it's important to stand back and just laugh at this, and since we are pretty sure it's not malicious, appreciate it.  I hope my submission to Microsoft will allow for better identification in the blockchain of non-threats.
@_date: 2014-05-15 21:47:35
Yep, and I think that's the whole point of it being a prank or a joke.  It's a silly harmless thing for someone to aggravate users, having their anti-virus pop up repeatedly as the client repeatedly downloads the same "infected" blockchain... you really have to stop and laugh, and appreciate how funny it is.

Hi. I don't have immediate questions for you, but I'll take this chance to speak with a member of the site directly. I initiated a withdrawal 4 months ago and didn't hear from Mtgox at all following the initiation. I emailed you guys several times only to hear "We're processing all withdrawals with a slight delay," which was very disheartening.
 I understand that you might want to update the way your site works in order to make future processing faster, but it's very important for you to be proactive about each and every possible problem. People are very protective of their money, and word-of-mouth spreads quickly -- I know you can be a good exchange and meeting point for a lot of bitcoin fans, but recently you have trended towards obsolescence (I don't mean this in an offensive way. I mean that other bitcoin exchanges with better policies and operation will replace you due to customer demand).  I hope for your sake that all works out in the end.  What you do have on the site already is quite good and easy to use, but the weak link of your operation is dragging the rest down.

Yep. I waited almost 4 months with no word from them about my withdrawal. It's not worth the wait, no matter how long it takes. To another exchange!
My only hope is that we can withdraw BTC soon, and that the price goes up in the meantime :-\
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:46:29
It's not possible? It's one of they many options they list for withdrawing funds.  I sold bitcoins and then withdrew the corresponding USD.  Apparently they go through a Japanese wire transfer company. Is there a better way to convert the coins to cash?
