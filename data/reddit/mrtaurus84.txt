Hi there,
Thank you for reaching out to National Bitcoin ATM and providing that information.
Our team investigated your transaction and it looks like you provided us with a bitcoin cash address (starts with bc) instead of a bitcoin address (starts with a 1 or 3). Please send a valid bitcoin address and we will send out your coins.
Looking forward to hearing from you!
