I just found 0.00127300 BTC in my changetip.  Some guy liked one of my comments and tipped me ten whole cents a long time ago.  It's now worth $22.  Freakin crazy.  I'm more of an ETH guy, but now I have my first bit of BTC!

I'll be the judge of that.

Uhh yeah I live in Virginia dude.  You're not supposed to tip uber drivers. That's the point.

It's a very simple thing to understand. [Uber pays the driver. The driver understands this when accepting employment. Uber is not a service you tip for.](

Maybe probation or your area has a special set of rules for Uber. I've only used it about ten times but never seen someone under a 4.8

TIL passengers have ratings.  That's interesting.
@_date: 2015-07-22 12:02:46
Exactly how it's supposed to be. It's quick, easy, informal, point A to point B.

That's pretty much the entire reason that I use Uber.  There's no awkwardness, no "how much should I tip this guy", none of that.  I don't even know how much my fare was until I leave the car and am walking away.  How should I know how much to tip him if I don't even know how much the fare was?

Ah. Gotcha. I'd absolutely love it if we went to a non tipping system here. I hate tipping. But I generally tip 25% because that's just how it works around here and I like people to like me...

I'm not interested in a conversation about the ethical standards of uber and their business model, sorry. It's not a service you tip for. Uber spells it out in black and white. If you go to a restaurant that has "no tipping" posted everywhere because their staff is paid and trained in that manner and you still feel the need to tip, that's on you. I won't be tipping.

Even so, the bank is no question - you would 100% of the time been fucked if you withdrew the money.  There's at least a chance that you could have kept the bitcoins and not had issue, however small the chance is.  You having 100k in the bank isn't "learning about temptation" because there's nothing to think about.  You literally cannot take it.  There's no temptation.

Guess I'm different than you. Having 100k in my bank account accidentally is not temptation for me. Neither is an open cash register at a grocery store. I know it would be easy to take the money but I also know I'd be fucked if I did. No temptation.

Yeah she got arrested. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 14:46:38
Yeah you're right.  My overuse of the word literally has literally got to stop.  It's even annoying me lately.
@_date: 2016-05-20 12:44:32
There's a huge difference between bitcoins and a bank transfer.  Chances are he could have just kept the bitcoins and nothing would have happened to him.  There are zero scenarios in which you'd come out ahead withdrawing the 100k from the bank.
