There's step by step instructions here on how to verify with kleopatra - 
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:01:50
Yes you can. The simple way to do this is to import your private keys of your greenaddress wallet address into Electrum by launching electrum &gt; create a new wallet &gt; Import Bitcoin address or private keys &gt; paste your private key here and click ok.
Once done, then in the 'History' section right click on the transaction that is unconfirmed and then selected Child pays for parent -&gt; increase the fee this time to a suitable fee (calculate it from here:  -&gt; Sign and broadcast the transaction. 
Note: Child pays for parent can only be done if you're the party receiving the funds.
Another way would be to perform Replace-by-fee (but only if your transaction in your greenaddress was somehow marked as replacable, not sure how to do this in greenaddress) and then iI believe I was able to do this in electrum by right clicking on the unconfirmed transaction -&gt; selecting increase fee --&gt; then setting a higher fee or using electrum's dynamic fee that was already set.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:31:07
If you've imported your green address private key into electrum, then wait for the synchronization to happen. Did the block headers synchronize in Electrum or is Electrum showing as Not connected towards the right bottom? Go into electrum's data directory and you'll see block_headers downloaded. If that's the case then you should be able to see your wallet balance.

No, that's absolutely fine. I was just wondering about this being a bit steep:
 Change of terms for the Payout service
There are changes to the fixed fee charged for the Payout service. The minimum fee charged is being increasesd from $4 to $8.
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:41:29
Sure, I've written steps here on how to do that: 
Just follow the first 4 steps above and you should be good. Let me know if you still face any issues.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:30:54
Sorry, It makes sense now, the $8 being their payout fee. I missed reading that clearly. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:27:41
Verify your download using GPG and then install it. If you already have an existing wallet that you were using with an older Electrum version, then you don't have to do anything else. Just launch it, input your wallet password and you're good to go.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:21:23
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:50:51


It's a false positive. Just ensure that you verify the signatures for the binaries. Also if you don't trust the binaries, build from source. It's open source.
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:22:59
It's confirmed now.

Cause of the volatility. If it rises it'll continue to rise sharply and someitmes if it doesn't it can fall sharply. You never know. So if today morning you bought bitcoin and it's falling sharply, it may not rise up to atleast the amount you bought it for today morning, by EOD. 
But hey! soon Bitcoins price might become stable once it attains massive adoption.

They exist, but the RBI (the central bank) has mentioned that they aren't licensing any operation of cryptocurrency exchanges and also mentioned that traders if trading are doing so at their own risk.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:49:53
I've accelerated your transaction on confirmtx and Antpool's priority tx accelerator. Most probably it should be included in their upcoming blocks.
The other ways to speed it up would be to perform Child-pays-for-parent or Replace by fee to bump up the transaction (considering that the wallet that you made the transaction from supports this and had this set prior to the transaction)
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:55:16
If you've never heared of it. Don't open it. Most of it are spam emails attempting to make you download stuff or link you to a phishing page. BE AWARE! Just report the email to your email provider as phishing or malware or spam.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:52:22
Oh yes it'll be easy enough for any of us to use.
For example there's a demo application already to buy coffee using testnet coins on your lightning client (called starblocks). So all you need to do is copy paste starblock's lightning channel ID and paste into your lightning application. Now there's also going to be an auto-pilot feature that would make it easy to establish connections between multiple open payment channels automatically. 
Once that's done, you copy paste starblock's payment request ID into your lightning app (don't have to type anything, it'll even show you the amount you need to pay) and just click send. Once done, it's instant payment and no more confirmations to wait for. 
Also, I think if you're aware of blockstream's elements project, they have the c-lightning app and it's being developed -  I have a feeling sooner or late it might be integrated into core once this is finalized. Remember it's just my feeling :)
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:26:44
It's going to be way faster and much cheaper. You'll need to open a connection from your client to a payment channel (which has sufficient funds) such that you can then on make multiple payments for incredibly low fees. If you want to try it out I suggest you visit  and download a release and try it out on testnet. Meanwhile if you find any issues you can report the same and help the developers fix it. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:43:23
Open up electrum 3.0 and above, create a new standard wallet -&gt; select 'Segwit' instead of legacy -&gt; Input wallet password and you're done. Bech32 addresses will start with 'bc1' and are not case sensitive. You can go to the address tab and view them.
Edit: corrected typo
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:48:35
I'd suggest you to switch to Electrum which allows you to set your own fees. They even have added support for Segwit addresses which should save you more on fees once you send from those addresses.
@_date: 2018-09-16 12:57:14
The title of this post is vague and the article highlighted in the tweet is not representative of "India" and neither does the person speak for India. It is an article written by a person named Jay Krishnan in Economic Times [here]( It's basically his opinion based on historical events and yes it clearly seems like he does not seem to know about the huge reduction in fees after SegWit was implemented and after the mempool cleared off.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:39:32
I think we need to inform it to their support. I contacted them via support to ask for Segwit implementation and they email'd me this article.

If you're looking for monetary rewards, no, but it rewards you in a way that is if you plan to run your own node (May it be a full node or a pruned node) you get to connect to it instead of connecting and trusting other nodes. If you use a wallet that allows you to connect to your own Bitcoin node and broadcasts your transactions through it then that is a very rewarding feature. For example, if you use Electrum then you can connect to your own Bitcoin full node by making use of Electrum personal server and this way you wouldn't have to worry about the SPV bloomfilter leaks to third party nodes / server, that the article posted by OP mentions.

BRD (Previously known as Bread Wallet) allows you to connect to your own Bitcoin node. Go to Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Bitcoin Settings &gt; Bitcoin Nodes &gt; Switch to manual mode and input the public or internal IP (if your phone's connected to the same internal network via WiFi) of your Bitcoin node. This will not work on TOR nodes as it doesn't recognize TOR addresses and also probably because you'll need to have a TOR connection to work out of safari browser and to route all traffic via TOR network, which I couldn't find a way to do even if jailbroken.

I figured the best online wallets were Greenaddress and Coinkite. They both are HD wallets with added security. Most of them store majority of their funds in cold storage and also provide multi-signature support for added security.
I also prefer Blockchain.info for its ease of use. You can also ensure Blockchain is pretty secure by ensuring the following is taken care of :
Setup 2FA, make sure you delete all wallet backups from your email, setup 2FA on your email and keep the wallet backup elsewhere on another device or somewhere safer and encrypted. On blockchain.info account settings make sure to disable Automatic Email Backups if already enabled.
Set a second password under account settings, so that to send any bitcoins the user will have to enter the second password too. Make sure this one is really unique and strong. It's also better not to set any password hints. If the password hits were set before this would be emailed to you, make sure to delete that too.
You can also set 2FA to be send to your phone via SMS or Google Authenticator rather than the email associated with your account. Also go to debugging under account settings and set PBKDF2 Iterations to 10,000 to make it harder for anyone to brutforce your password. Also, disable TOR IP's if you're not using it. If you have a static IP and if you're 100% sure you will be always on that IP to access your wallet, you can set a whitelist to allow only logins through your static IP.
Were you using Teamviewer or any other software providing access to your PC? probably you'll want to revisit all those apps you have installed and make sure no one's accessing your PC using it.
Also change your blockchain short username to something unpredictable by others.

This is the reason I never use them. They keep monitoring user transactions and they've mailed many users the similar way. Some being legit, it's against users privacy. They also collect user KYC information, which I don't like about BTC wallets. Same with XAPO.

Now now slow down there, anyone with access to a personal wallet on electrum or even a popular hosted service like Blockchain wouldn't have to input their address. It's hence probably better to use a safer and more privacy focused wallet service either offline or online like always said. KYC works well in a regulated environment, it's crazy to bring in regulatory like KYC policies and act as a middle man for Bitcoins.

You can have a hierarchical deterministic wallet with multi-sig support for additional safety on these wallets :
Also I think you can have Electrum setup on your personal computer, or an old computer that you don't install much software on. This way you can have full access to all your private keys. 
Just a suggestion, I could be wrong cause at the end of the day you'll need to ensure security of your wallets by taking the optimum steps necessary to secure them. Hope this helps.
The recent hacks on Blockchain are because of the broken keys on some newly generated addresses at the time which Blockchain had some bug in their system which was generating these keys. So whoever sent or made new wallet addresses during December 7th 21:53:26 UTC were affected by this hack. The whitehat hacker was kind enough to return the funds back to Blockchain. 
He did [mention]( this though "As an added caution, johoe said that anyone who visited their online Blockchain wallet during that period may have picked up the buggy script in their browser cache, which could potentially affect future address creation or transactions."
So probably I think there were still users having their buggy wallet addresses who have not yet regenerated new ones and he was able to run his script to hack more recently again. Hopefully he'll return the amount back this time too as he seems to be generous. 
I think Blockchain can be safe on your end if you setup the security on their page well enough, but on their end, I agree they'll have to work on a lot of issues if they have any more issues left.

Wonderful explanation! Thanks a lot for that. 
I've just had a glance at Bitreserve and Coinapult. I really like the concept of Coinapult where the price seems to stay the same no matter what in a "locked" state. It's something new and interesting to me. Probably they might use our funds to invest and earn from it mean while it is in a "locked" state, probably something like "Fixed deposits" in a bank, where a bank uses our funds and invests it. Although here we may not get any interest on it.
To be honest, I was searching about "Bitcoin market" and various other keywords which I can't recall on the reddit search bar, and came across your post. I haven't seen this post before, So I thought I might as well ask a question in here. :D

I remember it being about 390 at the start of this month I guess, and now it's down to 344. Could someone let me know what's the cause of this and if there's any possibility of the value rising up?

I think if your phone is already rooted and if you have USB debugging enabled already you can connect it to your PC and backup via ADB. 
Or if you have a USB mouse you can connect it to your android phone and use that just like your desktop that is if you are still able to see stuff on your screen. Watch this video it's a similar Sony phone broken screenand he uses a USB mouse with a USB OTG connected and it works great! 
Once you connect your USB mouse you can click and go to your wallet on your phone and transfer the funds to somewhere else safer on your desktop temporarily on another address. 
Next time, once you get your phone screen repaired, make sure you install something like safestrap and backup your whole android ROM and store it somewhere safe. Do this only after you transfer your funds back to the phone.

If you're using the TOR browser bundle change 9050 to 9150. Also if 50002 doesn't work at times, try 50001, though I sugges using 50002 cause it's over SSL.

You should try wallets like Electrum or Armory. You could set them up to work as cold storages so that your funds remain secure. 
You can move your funds by simply sending them to the addresses generated on electrum or armory.

Thinking about the price is more of a short term perspective, I feel Bitcoin is limited to 21 Million and sooner or later that limit will be reached. If that were to be the case, the price of Bitcoin that time would be high. So if you had 1 BTC now and even if it is worth only 250$ now, but in the future, hopefully it'll be worth more.

It's futures trading not future to be exact.
Basically when 2 parties are trading - A and B and when A agrees to purchase a determined amount of Bitcoins or Litecoins from B at a future period of time or a future date, but at the price fixed in the present. This allows hedgers to shift risks to speculators.

It's good in places where people can afford to buy a GoTenna mesh device. I think it's a 2 pack and costs about $179 (probably has additional discounts for referrals and stuff) but this is costly and not affordable by everyone. 
Also, most of the users are from US and Europe, but in Asia there are barely any. The market in Asia and the middle east needs more users before it can be easily used for users in these areas to broadcast bitcoin transactions though a well connect mesh device (probably a few hops away). 
Edit: One more thing, on the  website when you click on any of the download options with the 'Download TxTenna' popup, it'll all point to githubs website. I was probably expecting atleast the github link to point to their project page.

Doesn't it keep hopping through nearby GoTenna mesh devices, until it finds a GoTenna device that's connected to the internet to be able to broadcast the Bitcoin transaction to the blockchain? 
It says this on the website: "Through the online TxTenna user, transactions are confirmed on the Bitcoin blockchain and a private confirmation message is relayed back to the original TxTenna user. "  so basically one of the devices will have to use the internet

You should read these  and 
Support for the altcoin is out of scope of electrum wallet due to the insecure nature of header validation rules of the altcoin
It's safe to upgrade to 2.9.2 and it does not deal with the altcoin in any way. In order to acquire your altcoin, you'll need to download a wallet that runs on that chain, and import your private keys. I suggest you read the bcc2.txt link above on how you could do this, if you really want to.

sudo apt-get install git build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libssl-dev libevent-dev bsdmainutils libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-thread-dev libminiupnpc-dev libzmq3-dev jq

Basically I can relay traffic over the TOR network, and hence as soon as I run a full node over TOR, I can see incoming connections. My current ISP doesn't allow opening custom ports for incoming connections, due to which I can't host any public server, run a public bitcoin node with incoming connections over my clearnet IP or even run a gaming server.

Fiat is not illegal in India. Just the older Rs 500 and Rs 1000 paper notes have been replaced with a newer Rs 500 and Rs 2000 note (Rs 1000 note has stopped printing). We can easily go to our banks and they'll give us back the new notes in exchange for the old notes without loss in value.
Fiat is still legal, it's been made so as to combat corruption and black money.
Also, 8000 Indian rupees is about 120 USD. now the value is about 57000 INR (Selling price) in Indian exchanges which is about 840 USD. This is a very good gain for gaurav_ch! Congrats! :)

The finance ministry had setup a panel few months ago to investigate on how they could regulate Virtual Currencies. Just yesterday an article showed up and mentioned that it was recommended by the panel to launch a Governmental campaign to discourage people from buying Virtual Currencies due to several stated risks. It was also cited that a blanket ban on such currencies would not be imposed cause it would be hard. Hence, it isn't confirmed if it would be made illegal.
Although there are incredibly limited or negligible brick and mortar stores, corporations and companies that accept virtual currency payments, this could further discourage anyone else from doing so. I am really hoping that the panelists consider public opinions and transparently publish statistical reports of such public opinions for review online.
Considering all of these, it isn't clear if the Bitcoin / altcoin exchanges setup in the country would be affected or instructed to stop operations. There are already a number of well established exchanges operating with large-scale transactions.

Cash Ban?? No way was any cash banned. Only a newer version of the Rs 500 notes are being circulated and a new Rs 2000 note. People are still living through it fine except those in the lower income brackets who earn less and keep a lot of cash reserves and have no bank accounts.

The lines are not taking days. The queues are long, but you can get your money exchanged (majority of which is deposited in your bank account and the remaining amount upto Rs. 2000 can be received in cash. You can get Rs 4500 exchange until this coming Friday, after which you're only allowed to exchange Rs 2000, the remaining amount can be deposited to your bank account.) within 2-3 hours of standing in the queue. I've been to the bank 3 times to deposit my money and exchange, so I'm aware of this. I've tried depositing in 3 different banks and branches. 
You're made to fill a paper in the bank in which you've to input the source of the funds. Upto Rs 50,000 of deposits you're not to provide your PAN card. Deposits over 2.5 Lakhs for which income tax has not been paid, you'll have a 200% penalty. But, if you're able to show proof that you've already done show, then you're good to go.
You're free to sell your Bitcoins for fiat to purchase daily necessities or personal use. It's tough to get any Bitcoin debit card provider to ship them to India and almost no one accepts Bitcoins here. ZebPay an Indian Bitcoin wallet is nice enough to allow people purchase some stuff using their wallet, but it's basically costly stuff. Daily necessities are still bought in cash and fiat debit cards that don't have fee for transacting.

Thanks, but I previously did have a Tor Full node setup. I found that it connected to very limited incoming connections, about 12-14 at max, always. I also remember reading somewhere that tor nodes connections are prioritized lower as compared to regular nodes, could be the reason why and also I'm unsure if this is correct, but I do recall reading it somewhere but I'm unable to find the article / source to share it with you. Once I do find it, I will.
Also, if you do find any article that would help me setup one over a VPN with port forwarding, it'd help answer my question.
Edit: Also back in 2017, when I was running a Tor full node, I noticed that the Ranking of TOR nodes were very high, probably because of less incoming connections between other nodes.

If you're planning on downloading the entire blockchain and also a full node, ensure that incoming connections are enabled on port 8333 by opening the port on your router and configuring your firewall to allow incoming traffic through that port. Once you do that, you'll notice that incoming nodes will start connecting to you. Afterwhich ensure you check it's reachable by other nodes by inputting your public IP / tor address into the join the network box here: 
Also, to ensure that you're really helping the network, perform transactions from your wallet this will ensure you validate your own transactions and not rely on others.

Yes, on Digital Oceans cloud firewall, I've opened port 8333 for incoming and outgoing connections through UDP/TCP. I've also checked if there's any other firewall running on the VM, and there isn't. I'm still unsure as to what's wrong, I've followed fmlnoideas's suggestions for IPT rules below, but it doesn't seem to port forward for incoming connections still.

I've got a free Bizspark Azure subscription for having a visual studio license. So I get $150 per month free azure cloud services.  
My first month billing started on 25/01/2016 and ends on 24/02/2016. Used up about 50 USD of the 150 USD. So far 135 GB of Transfer in and 60 GB of transfer out with 45 connections to the node. 
I know probably it's very costly compared to Digital ocean or other cloud based services. But since I've gotten this for free, I'll continue to use it.

Wallet developers need to program their clients to allow sending / receiving to Bech32 addresses. These addresses are already backwards compatible to send/receive funds to and from any address. Until then, you can use a BIP39/49 mnemonic generated here  (generate them offline) and import this into electrum to have Segwit addresses starting with '3'.
Edited: Also currently you can send funds from Samourai wallet (Android) to a Bech32 address and soon to / from Bitcoin core 0.16.0.

It's the first time I've heard about Foldapp or Fold Coffee, but I'm intrigued by the simplicity of the purchase. What you need is some good online marketing to reach several regular Starbucks customers who are willing to pay in Bitcoins and get a 20% discount while doing so. I'd also love to see a kind of referral or gifting system where I would be able to Email or gift friends a coffee from your website. To inspire trust you can take user feedback and statistically analyze peoples requirements, and also add them into a small "testimonials" part on the website. Maybe create an android app so users can make the purchase on the go and also be able to leave feedback on the playstore, overtime I'm sure with a 20% discount people will surely love this! :D

A full bitcoin node running for 6-7 hours + (24 hours is best suggested) will support and help the network - 
I suggest instead of buying the Bitseed server, better download the blockchain on an old computer having 1 GB of ram.

Have you published your business in a Bitcoin merchant directory like on of these?   and  . If not you could try by doing so.
Try to create a page on your website which shows the importance of using Bitcoin for payments and how it's beneficial over credit card payments, and show users ways to purchase bitcoin by linking them to 
There are services like snapcard that pays you for promoting bitcoin 
Try to add your merchant website to coinmaps if you are a brick and mortar merchant, that way people who want to buy regular stuff would travel to you to pay with bitcoins.
When you're promoting your website or business online, try to always include that you accept bitcoins and offer discounts when bought with it. Do a lot of advertising online on blogs and other social media.

Okay, I noticed that it takes a while to show as "UP". After 10-15 mins of starting Bitcoin core I notice a user agent "getaddr.bitnodes.io" makes an inbound connection to my bitcoin core, and then when I refresh their page I see it as "UP". So it does take about few minutes. Apart from that also make sure your firewall isn't blocking the connections. I'm on windows so I'm guessing if you're on Linux you'll have to setup IPTables to allow bitcond and connections through 8333.
Also I see similar outbound connections with high ping times of 8000 and 10,000 + which I think seems to be normal I hope.

It wont be gone. Electrum uses a seed based backup. Even if your computer crashed or even if you format it you can restore your wallet and all your money on electrum installed on a new computer with that seed used for the restore. So make sure you either memorize this seed of 12 words (Must be 13 words now on the 2.0 version which is due to release this week) or write this down on a paper and keep it somewhere safe like a bank locker or personal locker
@_date: 2015-02-27 15:37:46
Please don't do that. Kindly save all your bitcoins in a wallet like electrum where you have access to all your private keys offline.

Yes, both Electrum and greenaddress wallets are safe because you own the private keys / seed and not anyone else. You can also for example in Electrum export the private keys, and print them on paper and cold store this. As long as you either keep your funds on Electrum or greenaddress and not transact, you're safe. 
This is because if the chain splits, your historical transactions / amounts (that is if you haven't transacted during August 1st) will remain on both these chains.

I asked this same question and got a response from the Electrum staff on the Bitcoinforums : 
Basically it'll restore your old seed and your wallet will be fine. It's just that now they use the BIP 32 new standard wallet format with a 13 word seed, so if you want to use it, you'll have to create a new standard wallet on Electrum 2.0 beta and transfer funds to it from your old wallet.
The staff responded saying: 
"Q1: a wallet seed cannot be "converted", this does not make sense. 
Old seeds are supported, that's why you can still use or restore your old wallet."
"Q3: again, you do not "convert" a wallet. 
All you can do is create a new one, and send your coins to it."
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:01:33
You do not need their website to access your coins. You can use wallets that support connecting your Trezor device to access your coins. An example of this for Bitcoin is Electrum. There's exodus as well (with their partnership: 
Also, you can choose to run a local instance of trezor wallet and trezor backend and never connect to satoshilabs servers (trezor server), guides already provided here:  and 
Also if you're worried about "trezor.io" or satoshilabs shutting down, it's once again the same thing, you can use it with other compatible wallets. See this: 
Also if you want to connect your trezor to your android device over OTG cable, you can do so too.  Similarly you can use Mycelium wallet for android which allows accessing your Trezor for Bitcoin.
Trezor for me is a good good option, and the model T is pretty good if you want a touchscreen interface instead of having to type your PIN on the computer which could otherwise possibly have keyloggers. Thus the model T in a way protects you from this as well. In addition to all of these Trezor one and Model T are both open source hardware with entire schematics available online so you can create your own  and the software is also open source and available on Github. This isn't the case with Ledger's hardware.
