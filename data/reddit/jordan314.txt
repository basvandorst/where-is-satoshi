Kraken sucks, I sold bch and couldn’t add a bank account so my money was stuck. I finally had to rebuy litecoin and transfer to another exchange and sell from there. Wouldn’t ever use their service again. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:17:00
I agree. I use an encrypted wallet in an encrypted sparseimage folder on Mac and sync it to the cloud. I also have PDFs of the paper wallets in the encrypted image. It’s funny that bitcoin fanatics don’t trust encryption and think a single hardware wallet is better.

As someone who loves bitcoin and someone who loves the environment, I'm conflicted--are we going to start talking about this?
@_date: 2014-01-04 08:04:14
I'm 12 and what is this?
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:26:06
I don't get it, sounds cool but can't I just sell someone a bitcoin from my wallet for cash now anyway, send it to them and wait for confirmations?

Seeing actual pictures of the energy waste that bitcoin generates makes me feel a little guilty. We could be using those hashrates to do machine learning or node-based supercomputing and act as a proof of work at the same time.

Uhh why does Bitcoin Ticker on iOS say that Coinbase Pro is at 4250.00 but Coinbase says it's at $9239?

If your private key was something guessable and not 2^256 in length then someone guessed it.

This is awesome, but the order seems to matter?  
python b2b.py 1 1234567890 0123456789ABCDEF  
returns 0  
python b2b.py 1 0123456789 0123456789ABCDEF  
returns 1
So for base 10 I should start with 0 right?
@_date: 2015-03-06 22:31:36

I don't understand what you mean. How is putting two hits out on people not attempted murder, and who are the thousands of people who would be kidnapped?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:58:00
Darn, I wanted to buy low too. Any fast alternatives to bitinstant?
@_date: 2013-10-03 16:54:07
I love this quote but this is a terrible use of it. DPR tried to have two people murdered, one for $80k but he was talking to an undercover agent, one for $150k but he likely got scammed.

Are you sure it wasn't downloading the blockchain the first time? I have an SSD and it still took a day to download. 
@_date: 2013-07-01 03:35:15
I remember this too, but bitcoin's value has not continued to tank like the dotcom chart did.
@_date: 2013-05-20 20:09:34
I'm surprised the pi has enough memory! I tried to run bitcoind on a 512 MB memory server and it kept crashing, I had to upgrade to 1 Gb.  
Edit: just read the writeup, see you're running bitcoind on a different box. Makes sense.
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:01:32
Yeah, I think a web based version of this tool could be cool too (be able to place trades).

Cash deposits are back up and I had a transfer go through an hour ago.

It's going to be awfully hard for the DOJ to get the names of everyone who has bought bitcoin. You can buy bitcoin anonymously.
@_date: 2013-05-03 05:25:25
I always recommend the opposite, never trust online wallets, google blockchain.info hacked for multiple examples of peoples' wallets getting hacked. It's way safer to run bitcoin-qt, encrypt your wallet and back it up.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:09:43
I don't understand why everyone is rooting for the dollar to fail. If the dollar fails, terrible things will happen. How will you buy groceries? How will you pay for your internet to do any bitcoin transactions? I would say be careful what you wish for, I am rooting for bitcoin AND the dollar.
@_date: 2013-07-30 20:29:16
Darn, I ordered a 5gh single, upgraded to 7gh, but it looks like it's not getting here by september so I am still screwed. I ordered in April and it looks like they still haven't shipped singles past orders from 10/2012. I would file a claim with paypal or a CC but I paid with bitcoin. This is the second time I've been burned buying a miner with bitcoin :(

I still don't see "Pay from: Cash Deposit" as an option. Usually I do that to wallet, print out the form, go to a CVS, pick up the moneygram phone, follow the prompts, give the cashier money, and the BTC goes into my wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:54:32
Actually now the other exchanges have pulled up to Mtgox's 130

FWIW I just did a cash deposit today at 12:30 and it credited my wallet by 1:30. But my friend's transaction took days.

Wow Bitcoin's going to infinity!
@_date: 2013-04-25 06:19:09
My point is that if you say your password is exactly 10 characters, and you're not lying, that rules out 1-9 character passwords as well as 11-9999 character passwords, which is a huge superset.
@_date: 2013-05-03 05:36:04
This is cool. So it does a minor 7th for upward trends, and static for lower trends? Couldn't tell if the static was intentional or a chrome bug.
@_date: 2013-04-15 07:02:39
Seems like it wants to naturally go to $200 but it gets derailed by network attacks and people panic selling from the lag. If MtGox can hold its shit together this week I think it might.

I think it will rebound too, but if they can't figure out a way for DDOSes to stop manipulating the market, the currency will never stabilize and lay users will get turned off from the currency in general. I hope this doesn't happen.

Also stuck on the first screen. The form uses GET and not POST but that's not necessarily a vulnerability. Simple SQL injection doesn't seem to work. I checked their robots and it says "# you wont solve any challenges with bruteforce"
