A lot...To me a trustless society even harbinger a new stage of governmentless world, no concept of nation or organization. if every action of human beings can incentivised by a trustless consensus (you go to work and register your working progress knowing the consensus will reward you with crypto currency; you lend your capital that ensured by the consensus with a interest; making a political proposal that can be voted by legitimate individuals), that will be the beginning of a nationless society.

I started investing in Jan 2017 cuz I thought it was time. Fund from Jan to April, then get into stock for higher return, found the stocks are too manipulated by big houses like GS, disappointed then started investing bitcoin late July, in an average of usd2400. Happy since.

That requires address registration first, you can always register a blank address and do business with another anonymous address. Unlike cash, which you ultimately will deposit in a bank account under your social ID.

If China starts 51% attack on bitcoin, The US could also do that, then it will be very hard for China to maintain that 51% superiority. If every body else does nothing, then it will be the end of bitcoin. I'm not sure if switching from POW to POS could prevent this problem.

For a deflationary currency, hodling is the natural outcome of market behavior.

No, coinbase is like the vending machine outside the exchange to sell you bitcoins, gdax IS the exchange.

I personally don't think bitcoin is better than cash for the purpose of spending. A spending currency has to be inflationary, otherwise everybody will just hodl instead of purchasing goods, which is bad for the economy. Bitcoin is deflationary currency, that's why people call it digital gold. Ofc you can spend your gold, but why you would pay somebody 100 dollar worth of gold if it could worth 200 dollar six months later? You think about it, then you pay in dollar cash.

Every time North Korea threats us and South Korea with missle launch, KRW and JPY flee to safe heaven like bitcoin. Today Kim did a underground nuclear test, what do you think will happen on the first weekday tmr?

You can't, unless you already have cny cash in Chinese exchanges and withdrawal bitcoin from there quickly.
