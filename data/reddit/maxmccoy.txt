Ok, so quite a few options. This seemed logical. That makes BTC seem highly established.

Honest question and I don’t know.  If bitcoin is the digital analogy to gold, it seems reasonable.  It would be more liquid, I would think.

Thank you.  I’ll take a look

There are very significant markets where the stake you hold is backed by some kind of real property, something of tangible and intrinsic value.  My guess is the price fluctuation is a significant hurdle.  I think trust isn’t the major problem, I’m sure a credible, existing institution can ensure the security of the keys.  The institution needn’t be FDIC insured, either.  I’m sure there are downsides to the concept, but on the upside is the ease of investing increases for folks.  Like an EIRT or ETF.

Which country and why, if you don’t mind my asking?

There’s wealth and there’s resource, and they may not always be the same (though they mostly are).  And I don’t think we’re getting off this rock in a significant way.  I love the optimism though.

What does that mean?
@_date: 2019-12-06 12:24:12
Yes, thank you.

That would actually be a cool feat to pull off, depending on who is selling. FroM private citizen? Cool. From Tesla? Really cool.

Very interesting endgame. This assumes govt(s)?regulation doesn’t find its way in, besides self-regulation. 
Good take on the passage of generational wealth. I had never considered that.

And that’s probably the best way to do it.  I know you would never want to see him completely fail.  Perhaps you could consider creative ways to do what your planning in the form of gifts. I like the responses I’ve been getting from this question.  I’ve got a small amount invested in GBTC but mostly as a point of interest. It will be interesting to see where it goes.

What fraction of a BTC is a sat?

It’s a different school of thought. It has nothing to do with having kids or not. I was raised with the idea that you only get what you earn, and yeah, somewhere down the line my parents will croak, but whatever they have isn’t their problem anymore. My father isn’t very generous in the way that you are.  It wasn’t a judgment call so much as a statement of fact.  I can’t imagine my life wandering aimlessly about in my 20’s knowing I had my dad as a safety net if I ever needed some cash. I’ve never taken a dime from my old man. I wouldn’t.  I’ve received many generous gifts, but it’s not exactly the same thing. I never needed those things to survive. Nah, I knew there was nobody going to save me if I stepped in it. I suppose that shaped a lot of my decisions early on in life.  My mom, on the other hand would have done like you, if she had the means, but she could never rub two dimes together.  So it was never something on my mind.  Sounds like you’re replying from outside the US, possibly Netherlands region.  Yeah, it’s a bit different here. I never took a loan, per se, to attend college.  Paid for the early years out of pocket and scholarships to finish.  I never did have massive student loan, so that helped out immensely I suppose.  The student loan “crisis” is the result of the fed banishing the private sector from issuing the loans.  Since 2008, I think, the cost of university has spiraled due to faculty and extraneous program expansion at virtually all brick and mortar universities.  I’d have to look it up, but an act of Congress basically excluded the private sector from the student loan business.  They passed the act under the idea that it would curb predatory loan situations.  The net effect, though, was a symbiotic relationship between the fed, who now issues the loans, and universities.  As universities expand, the fed expands the loan size to the student.  It’s a reinforcing cycle with the student caught in the trap.  The cost is left unchecked because they have no skin in the game like the private sector did.  The university knew no matter what, the fed would pay, even if students defaulted on the loans, it was/is taxpayer money.  So the problem is fixable, but right now I don’t think congress gives a shit. They have a president to put on trial.  Like I give a shit about that.  
Sorry for the late night ramblings.
