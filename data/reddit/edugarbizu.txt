I still don´t fully understand this Lightning stuff...
Is it the same as the Open-Transactions system of Monetas.net? Or is it more like the Tembusu Systems?
Which system is the best and what are the diferences?
Can anyone make a comparison between them?

What happened with the AMA? Was it canceled?
Roger Ver is organizing a big AMA event here  and he is actually looking for participants.
I think it could be a good opportunity for the people to know more about Monetas and a good oportunity also for the company to get some exposure
