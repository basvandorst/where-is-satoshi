So explain how you are supposed to margin trade without leaving balances on their? That is where the majority of BTC funds are on Bitfinex. You're going to wait an hour before you can buy/sell so you can take advantage of volatility? Do you simply not understand the concept of trading?
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:40:38
Because I did spread it evenly and only risked what I could afford to lose? Still doesn't mean that you aren't forced to keep money on the exchange if you actually want to trade on it. The entire premise of "yo why didn't you keep your money off an exchange" is pointless bullshit drivel which adds 0 to the conversation. The answer should be fucking obvious. You are literally spouting empty rhetoric and anyone with basic understanding of english and trading knows what you said is not equivalent to "you shouldn't keep your eggs in one basket".

So here is the perspective of a seller.
Ok so you agree on a $ amount to transfer and boom you send it. Then all of a sudden after waiting 20 minutes because for some reason their shit phone isn't updating they come to realize that the price has changed and all of a sudden they want more btc from you. Did I mention that this fucktard wants to wait till 3 confirmations since he is basically new? Is your pricing app different from theirs? Does feedback generate more sales? Does LBC want to continue to operate (they take 1% from me)? Have I been flawlessly using this site for years? Sorry I already work 50 hour weeks, I want to make this transaction as smooth as possible. With my regulars they literally hand me an envelope full of cash and we are both out the door in less than 2 minutes. It even logs it for me so I can declare it on my taxes.
The reason why I don't want to is because of consistently BAD experiences with off-lbc transactions.
Not to mention everyone is always fucking late
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:36:56
There is no middle ground, that is the absolute power and weakness of bitcoin. You are doing a disservice in my opinion by sugarcoating it, they simply shouldn't have risked more than they could have lost and they should money is at risk while playing the game. High risk, High reward. When you look and see that Bitfinex had over 50% of the value in longs, most people who lost were players of the game, ignorant or not.
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:53:43
That's the same fucking thing.
@_date: 2016-04-09 08:11:25
LBC trader here. I always get cash first, then release. If they really have a problem with doing that as a local meetup, you can enable escrow so that it can only be cancelled by the buyer or LBC staff, this ensure buyer protection, however as a seller the only protection you have is $$$ first. Also use a counterfeit pen for bills $50 and up.
Also unless you are in a big city, chances are that you will not get a buyer unless you are selling very close or below market rate. In the bigger cities the margins are already razor thin. Remember that LBC takes a 1% cut.

I think the Black Market Bitcoin side is a good example of market-based regulation. Since the closure of Silk Road, Sheep's Marketplace, Silk Road 2.0 and TorMarket as well as many smaller ones. Now people use multi-sig wallets for "escrow" and are looking into developing decentralized versions.

Correct me if I'm wrong, I'm rather ignorant on this subject. But isn't fractional reserve banking only possible because of fiat currency's properties. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:04:31
I don't know if you're being sarcastic or honestly don't know because I clearly indicated that it closed. In this case however it wasn't seized by the feds but rather the owners absconded with all the funds held on the site and in escrow. The point being that now certain sites have made it so that escrow funds are not held within the hands of the site operators and rather it acts as a mediator and communication platform versus being a complete middleman.

I mean hypothetically yes? But if a near total majority of mining were to turn to this then I would see it as the death of Bitcoin and look elsewhere. However this is a rather strawman proposition, as you would have to provide me the context as to why miners would ever do this in the first place when you consider rational self-interest. For example achieving a near-total majority for a change such as the halving reward algorithm would simply never pass. You would have to assume that any properly initiated hard fork would have to establish at least a massive majority based on the signaling of both nodes and users in relation to miners rolling out hardware and software upgrades.
It seems to be a pretty poor argument to assume that a vast majority of actors would suddenly decide to act maliciously when the entire original problem being solved that created Bitcoin is founded on the assumption of a minority appearance of bad actors. I believe in the collected community of minds that is tackling this problem and if you manage to find yourself in the 5% and I am on the 95% side, then clearly at that point in time to me, you are the bad actor. If I find myself in the 5% side, I will leave Bitcoin and find a crypto that shares my principles. Which is exactly what LukeJr is saying he will do in changing the POW algorithm in case of a hard fork. But make no mistake, once that occurs you are not Bitcoin anymore, and how can you be if you shrink your userbase, value, places of acceptance, which is what would occur in the case of properly executed hard-fork.
@_date: 2017-02-06 06:58:53
Uh please explain where I asserted that?
@_date: 2017-02-05 14:11:39
You're right semantics are important. Which is why you're correct in saying that it is the creation of an altcoin, but what you're failing to address is that in the case of an economic and user majority, it is the old chain that would be the alt.
Please explain this


More importantly explain why in the case of a hard fork why the majority chain is suddenly not Bitcoin anymore when it is the default, and not the alternative. 
I don't understand what makes you believe that Bitcoin is equivalent with original and not the version that is being followed and secured by the majority of hashing power. If "original" Bitcoin loses that security, it becomes not Bitcoin, and the newer chain which preserves the vast majority of security and continuity would be Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-06 13:33:45
I clearly stated that this in the case of a hard fork, so not a random SHA256 shitcoin.
So preserving the elements of Bitcoin including the entirety of the blockchain sofar, as well as assumable to be functioning in a quite similar manner and maintaining the majority of identical elements, which is what a FORK is.
You should really learn about reading, if you are unable to read, then any thing you say after is through a flawed lens of understanding. Your reading is simply too poor.

So where in my history have I advocated for BU?
But also, I will surely leave if the signaling for Segwit hits 95% which I am once again very confident it won't, same if the opposite happens for BU, once again confident that it won't.


No they work for themselves, which remains today an integral part of the economy. The more you rant and rave about how you will somehow find a way around a clearly very significant part of economy, you paint yourself as just as delusional as those arguing for BU.

He said they would be happy to review, simply because you have not experienced change, and it is easily clear why, doesn't mean it would not apply to others who are in a different situation. $2000 worth of btc on minuscule margins and you expect they want to give you the benefit of the doubt of instant cashing out $1k? On my own personal account, after using for the last 4 years I was unable to verify using the prior identification methods, when I got verified I was able to email them and upgrade my limits. Sorry but they are a business and just because you don't think from their perspective doesn't mean they are lying to you. Likewise if they did what you suggested I guarantee a few dedicated individuals would put them in the red in no time at all.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:12:45
So the original question is what are other risk factors in the case of reaching 95% hash power, which you countered that nodes not supporting is a risk factor. So in essence you are arguing the existence of the scenario where we approach 95% hash power, without significant node support, which my argument is that is absolutely laughable seeing as miners run a significant amount of nodes, hence it would make no sense for there not to be some level of base support, not to mention that would also assume that the change in miner support was either sudden enough that nodes would not have chance to upgrade, or that the entirety of node support would choose to reject blocks mined, which in both scenarios are unrealistic.
Hence why I am saying the vector of uncooperative nodes being a risk in a hardfork assuming 95% consensus is poor in its entirety. 
Or maybe you could not sidestep my question of what arbitrary level of node support it suddenly deemed "safe" or more importantly, what level of node-nonsupport do you arbitrarily deem "dangerous".
Edit: You say strawman, yet I am simply outlining the scenario you have outlined yourself. We are talking about 95% consensus correct? So when you state "large portion of miners" I assume you mean enough to reach 95% consensus, which in case you believe that such a movement there would be less than 5% node support? I fail to see how such a scenario would occur simply following the known trends of bitcoin insofar as well as the increasing difficulty to achieve such massive swings moving forward.
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:04:39
You realize the phrase was first used by in this chain who is clearly advocating for SegWit right?

Sorry but $1000-2000 is chump change for a banking institution. Simply followed the suggestions and I have helped multiple friends max out their limits according to my state. I don't see how failing to read the provided instructions means that he is providing misinformation. Same with Circle, I simply maxed my weekly limit for 3 months and boom my limits were raised. It isn't that hard. If it is taking you more than 4 months to max your limit, you're either incompetent or by definition, not spending enough consistently to warrant the risk of raising your limits.
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:57:02


















The code for the hard-fork will therefore be available by July 2016.
If there is strong community support, the hard-fork activation will likely happen around July 2017.

Obviously I removed a bunch of people but still relevant, but the point still stand is over the last year I have watched multiple of these members change their stance on hard-forking so that now it has been absolutely demonized as the "last resort" method. You would find that half a year ago I agreed, but after thinking about it for quite some time I believe that the ability to hardfork is a vital component of bitcoin and politically establishing the precedent to avoid forking at all costs, when the solution is an obvious no brainer such as raising the base cap to 2mb is worrying, not to mention stifling to innovation. Then I have seen the argument against larger blocks has repeatedly been cut down from 8 to 4 to 2 and now the only technical reason is a hard fork. 
And I have said it again, yes BU is dangerous and I disagree with it ideologically, but the same can be said for segwit as its current implementation, when there is a clear goal to circumvent any changes that would require hardforking. I feel that this absolute avoidance will cripple Bitcoin when you look years down the road.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:16:37
In control of what? You don't do shit. The beauty of Bitcoin is that it allows you to operate under the scope of the supposedly benevolent majority (by benevolent I mean mutually beneficial agreement). If you tried to run a node that made its own rules that didn't conveniently fall under the scope shared by the entire network, at best you would amount to a wet fart. To say that you "control" Bitcoin in anyway other than access to your private keys is absolutely delusional. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:29:31
So you're saying that if we reached 95% miner consensus, there would be a realistic risk that there would not be a sizable chunk of nodes that would be running whatever is being hardforked to?
Because when you say "If the nodes don't support the hardfork" you are suggesting that somehow all the nodes would band together to reject the mined blocks to my understanding?
Taking into consideration the fact that miners themselves run a sizable quantity of nodes, is there a required "percentage" or a flat number of nodes needed where this would not be a risk? Seems like a rather empty argument to possibly assume this scenario.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:23:32

@_date: 2017-03-24 14:14:41
Right it is, but once again I see that you have failed to even take a close look at where you are pulling your information.
93% of core nodes is the most recent spit out version of Luke Jr.'s node counter. We have complaining of BU signalling with too many fake nodes, yet for some reason it is perfectly normal that there were over 15k core nodes added within the last two months? Literally a 33% increase of all nodes ever? Luke has even said in his comment history (~~5 days ago~~) that he is suspicious of it, but he is unable to find the reason why (he believes his math/coding is sound). At least he has the decency to admit it but why do I see everyone here quoting it like it is the fucking gospel? 
If you actually looked at long-term node trends rather than sourcing from one source, you would know that the EXACT PARTICULAR SOURCE  you are looking at is the definition of non-reliable.

And here we have the opposite, with "we should change the PoW algorithm to punish miners" or "alternative-token supporting BU". I don't like SegWit or BU in current form but it is absolutely laughable that you can say

If they are amiable you can have them sign the receipt with their LBC name, write no refunds on it, and then have them rip it up and send you a picture. Time does not matter when the other actor can maliciously try to social engineer a refund. After all, one large trade is worth and if it fails, it is still a fair trade for them.
I am simply stating what I have been asked to do when on the other side (buying for cash deposit)
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:47:53
So... please explain why there can't be the same activation requirements for a hardfork as currently implemented by SegWit, requiring both a difficulty adjustment period of support before activation, and another prior to actual enforcement? The possibilities for implementation are open, we could even expand the buffer periods for support as well as activation.
And again your picture of a hardfork is once again outlined by an extremely unrealistic scenario. You speak of how hard it is to convince 10/10 people to choose somewhere to eat, yet your argument is that all of a sudden, 19/20 miners will suddenly implement a radical new change, overnight, and the danger arises from that?
Also human interaction and decision-making is not required by all nodes/users in the event of a hard-fork. The only difference between hard/soft how those who do not upgraded are treated, a change in consequence in that nothing happens vs. you are now in a different chain from the majority. You can still choose to do nothing in both a hard/soft fork case.
@_date: 2017-01-30 15:15:39

I do a lot of local volume in a sizable city. Lowest local rate is 10% above market
Where I get coin? Trade secret to be honest but I have had to branch out to meet demand so I procure it in 4-5 ways, some much more laborious than others.
For example even with 1% LBC cut, I could still technically do bank deposit if I really needed because even at 4-6% I'd still make money selling at 10% of 5-3% which in turn means that amount traded has to be larger for it to be worth it.

Anything where there is money moving is where you should go. Just gotta understand that you can make 50% return in a month and lose it all to a hack.
@_date: 2016-11-21 14:20:36
To counter i have also though that this is a political move but vice versa. Say with this much trouble implementing segwit, what is to say that if the ecosystem expands to accomodate 4mb blocks that the current 95% consensus will be even possible anymore? It is the slippery slope that now we can just raise the limit even more rather than making a change. With more money and risk involved it will just be harder to convince people to roll out segwit.

So what is acceptable decentralization. If it is too much then isn't bitcoin in danger at this moment? Why would you hold any bitcoin then?
Oh wait because, this is your personal opinion, fundamentally not backed by anything else.


Yeah you know the one that has been called for nearly two years now? Plenty of crypto-experts are for "indiscriminate" block-size increases.


Yeah and I was deliberately trying to outline the absolute absurdity of many requirements that people try to tie in to 1MB Blocksize.
The study referred to accounted for Bandwidth, RAM, as well as Harddrive space, and still found 8MB acceptable loss of decentralization (mind you this was fall 2015). Which is in direct contrast to what he is saying right now.

So where does cost of a running a node become &lt; transaction fees for something like VISA? The fact that you can maintain the ability to run a node off a fucking Raspberry PI is charity.
@_date: 2016-10-31 15:09:47
Do more reseach, mining is extremely cutthroat
@_date: 2015-11-04 16:55:21
Here is some basic math to put things in perspective for you.
Let us assume we have the same amount of coins (lets say 15 million) in these two scenarios.
1. Price per BTC is valued at $200
2. Price per BTC is valued at $20000
So with finite supply of coins, what matters is not the percentage of price volatility in the long run, but rather the overall total amount of money that ALL BTC is valued at.
In both cases if the price went up $50, the amount of $$$ being added to the ecosystem is at least linearly related, this is determined by infrastructure, $$$ saved on possible uses, revenue generated, mining costs ETC, jobs, and a so many more factors it is almost impossible to predict compared to the price and number of coins mined.   
Yet in one case we have a 25% volatlity and the other .25%. If you were to apply a .5% per day it would be reasonably quick, however practically UNFEASABLE because that would mean the amount of money being invested into the bitcoin sphere would have to EXPONENTIALLY increase daily. It is far more likely for there to be pumps and dumps until the base price of BTC reaches a point where a volatility of today (change in overall value of the bitcoinsphere) would be negligible compared to the overall investment.
This is synergized with the halving of the blocks mined and serves to expedite the process where we reach a stable price. Also keep in mind in order for BTC to constantly maintain an effective price, the amount of money pouring in must be at least equal to the # of blocks mined per day * the price.
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:55:34
And it is to my understanding that in order to provide enough time to find a good answer, we should increased MAX_Blocksize to 2MB in time with SWSF.
There is a reason why 2MB was called for nearly 2 YEARS ago. Now 2MB by itself is not enough, which is why we need the average 1.7-1.8 multiplier of SegWit.
I find it to be a dangerous assumption as well to base the effectiveness of the blocksize on the presumption that many or most transactions now will operate on LN. Conservatively, LN introduces a huge amount of NEW use cases that can easily replace the ones that would switch over through the opening and closing of channels, as well the good possibility that many if not most currently on-chain use cases will remain that way

Maybe because you have to wait an entire goddamn week.
4 Business days, so if you don't happen to do it on monday or tuesday (sometimes even on tuesday) you have to wait 4-6 days to get BTC.
Then again I'm using it for small transactions and I manage to lose $40 just waiting for coinbase to fucking process. If I used the 5% fee last thursday I would have lost $20, now I lost $40 and everything that cost BTC got more expensive. G fucking G

I just bought at $460 and already made $300 from doing nothing. Literally just watched it rise $10 in as many seconds. This is a rollercoaster of fun.
and  is the real price imo

I thought they didn't use ID / Utility bill to verify your identity. IIRC you're full of shit?

They will charge you eventually. I had a $70 dollar payment that took 10 days to charge. Then they charged my 2nd $220 dollar payment without giving me btc and I noped the fuck out and cancelled that shit.

Just bought, I'm talking about my "gains". And I stalk localbitcoins for good deals. I can just instantly request a trade and pop over to the bank and deposit cash or run to the CVS and get a moneypak.

It is honestly the fastest way to purchase bitcoins and you get to do it anonymously as well. You can have have those bitcoins in your control in under 5 minutes for a good price. However there is the rare case of scammers.

Currently I'm ready to dropkick bitinstant customer support. I can't exactly say for their cash deposit service, but the brief moment they offered bank transfers they really fucked up. For some reason they have charged me (Zipmark has) for a payment that hasn't even gone through to bitcoins. Even after a full day of the payment processing in my bank I still haven't received $$$ wired to my Mt. Gox account. Add to the fact that I made this order a week ago. Fuck Bitinstant atm, they will come through but fuck them.
Funny thing is two days ago I already emailed both zipmark and bitinstant I would like to cancel the order in the first place seeing as though it was already delayed for so many days.
I want to edit this and say that eventually you will get what you paid for. Its just that eventually is driving my business away from bitinstant. When you talk about a week delay with no response from customer support yet has the time to talk in this subreddit and advertise. Their slogan is "Time is Money" and sadly it is my time and my money that is at stake.

However I do not think it should be a requirement to keep a minimum of twice as much as you should be willing to spend. If i wanted to buy something for $500, which could be in my budget, I have to budget $1000? Why would I use bitcoins then. This is what truly hurts bitcoin.

Yeah he made it as an art project, not to withstand the scrutiny of people investing thousands of dollars.
In the digital age, a false identity would be deduced by the lack of information. Everyone including me and you has massive datapools of online information. There is no way you could generate enough content to withstand close scrutiny by the government or any driven individual.

some of us are poor

Because people care and actually look into things like identities.

More like you got sent to a shitty phishing website. Because in no way shape or form do they ask for a utility bill.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:22:45
to be honest it could seriously just explode after. I'm really worried that it'll pass 1000 and never come back down.
