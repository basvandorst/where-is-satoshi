SBB ticket machines have a long history of offering other services than just train tickets. DB terminals literally do nothing else than ticketing and helping with timetables

Peso's what
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:48:56
What happened to it?
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:36:53
Have you read the links in the sticky?
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:34:27
share it
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:06:56
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:24:26
How do you do this?
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:43:48
Then define a failure
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:18:46
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:37:46
It makes sense, but I don’t know if it’s achievable? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:23:58
what do you mean?
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:24:07
Even that would be impressive, eh?
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:36:52
Yeah I didn’t mean it in a positive way
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:34:28
Be sure your fork doesn’t get canceled by up to six people
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:25:31
Thank your for being nice and thanking him.
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:05:15
It’s pretty nice actually
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:03:09
Every day something to learn
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:36:31
known for years? got a source?
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:01:42
So they won't offer bitcoin services at all anymore?
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:15:50
Well it's most probably because China is the giant market of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-21 01:58:39
Then they probably don't tell their origin correctly or have IP addresses which could be confused?
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:56:27
it’s very interesting indeed, thank you. In Europe bank transfers are forced to be finished within 24 hours on bank days.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:42:46
How long does it take for a bank transfer in America?
@_date: 2017-10-16 04:09:37
Well I mean bitcoin is in a sense more real than something that could be deleted by a single entity
@_date: 2017-05-28 22:41:35
Can anyone explain what Support means?
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:50:51
It doesn’t feel like a bubble bursting tbh. It’s just a 15-20% drop
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:22:31
Is blockchain.info unsafe by any means? I’m a newbie just asking.
@_date: 2017-07-07 11:57:54
I thought confirmation is unnecessary because it’s virtually impossible to be exploited?
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:33:37
I used bitcoins for a lot of other stuff than drugs and I want it.
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:42:30
I pretty much found people agreeing on BC.i being unsafe here because browsers and their extensions are subject to unsafety a lot. Thank you for your answer

Darknet and drugs are features?
