Look at all the post from all this year; people who bought tops but held strong get rewarded. We are only at .5 T marketcap. We going to atleast 5 trillion, think where btc will be then.

It’s going to be interesting to see how cryptos play out in the near future once/if mainstream adoption occurs. Which I have a bias that it will 100%. We will look back at these articles and analyze where we were in the timeline.

Lol my first correction was the China incident 1300 to 900 just when I had started to learn how to trade. Good initiation, aka rekt

Also for the people that bought at the top. Just know there's plenty of people here that bought the top at 2900 and are pretty happy right now. Hodl strong

It’s due for a correction guys.

Oh lord. I can’t wait to see how the crash in the next 10 years is going to be. It’s gonna be great. Like he said don’t buy bitcoin it crashes too much.

Btc eyeing that trillion dollar market cap soon. Patience is the key

Guys day trader here. Any good trader will tell you price was due for a correction, it just so happened that roger, Jihan and company used that knowledge to their advantage to start pumping their coin and making the Average investor think that bitcoin is under attack and shake them out . If you sold at 7K good job buy back in around 5K, don’t be buying into BCH pump and dump because you will end up losing once bitcoin bounces strong from support area

People buying the top. We will see how many stay after the big correction occurs.

This would be a good time to take some profits off the table.

I tried to catch them at the end of the match to contribute some btc but too many people on the way out.

Hey guys, day trader here.  These next couple of weeks are going to be very volatile. Strap your seat belts and try not to look at the price too much. We will come out of this one, this bounce up in my opinion won't last too long. Hoping to be wrong but candlesticks so far don't look too good. Either way don't sell for a loss, bitcoin is here to stay.

I feel the same way. I mean I was happy it was up to 2700+ but at the same time I knew it was a bubble waiting to burst. It looks as though it found heavy support around this are so good news. If you bought in at the top don't worry it'll go back up, if you sold I'm sorry for your losses(made the same mistake back in the China news crashes).

Lol when I got into bitcoin in December the first few crashes I experienced were psychologically tough. Today I watch that $600 drop in GDAX, didn't think much of it.
