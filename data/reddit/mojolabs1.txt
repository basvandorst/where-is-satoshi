This question deserves a serious, data-based response. 
The real reason is debt. Look at the balance sheet of the USG. Over $15T in debt, and $50T in unfunded liabilities. By any measure of accounting, the United States is in a very serious debt problem. The bipartisan Congressional Budget Office agrees (read their recommendations to congress).
The US is currently running an annual deficit of $1.1T. That means that every year this debt is increasing. We are approaching the 100% debt to GDP ratio. 
A country's currency depends on sound finances. If we are spending (govt expenditure) way more than we are earning (taxes), the government and its credit (the dollar) will suffer devaluations and market corrections. 
When? Who knows. Fiscal collapses can take decades. This drama could take 30 years to play out by which time we'll all already be dealing in bitcoin.

Someone I know - a friend of a friend actually committed suicide b/c she lost all her life's savings on MtGox. 
People have died over this. *Literally*. Karpeles should burn in hell.

they can't eliminate fraud, but most of them don't shut down b/c of fraud. they do get in trouble from bad loans, bad business decisions etc. but not fraud or theft. Most importantly, they have the FDIC backing them up.

the victim's family doesn't want the press jumping on this, the way they've been doing with Satoshi. I'm respecting their right to privacy and to mourn their loss.

thats a good question - I was leaning towards charging people a small fee to store AND insure their deposits, like an "old-style" bank would. Lending out people's deposits kind of puts the whole secure storage premise at risk - since bad loans, and/or theft could bring you down.

this is more important than anyone realizes. thank you for sharing this on-the-ground information from CES.

have you tried contacting large investors to sell to them directly? I know secondmarket's new bitcoin fund buys directly from miners...

standard ID auth. Plus deposits can only be returned to addresses they came from. Several intl. financial institutions do this to prevent fraud.

no harm giving your bank account number. I have 4 friends who use them, without any issues. Plus once you get an account, you can enter a VISA credit card and transact using only that instantly, and never have to use your bank account.

the most reliable place to buy bitcoins is Coinbase. They are US venture-funded technology company based in Silicon Valley (there I am). Been using them for over a year, no issues. Compare this to Mt Gox, BTC-e and others which are all terrible.
