Lol panic selling, panic selling is over long time ago, now time is for those that HOLD to slowly lose faith and value of bitcoin go under 5k, at time it will get over taken by some other cryptos. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:13:44
No, no he does not. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:41:51
I'm waiting for it to drop to dolla, I'm gonna spend 10$ on it to person with most HODL in their post history. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 07:37:34
Does it not make you sad working 9-5 and lie about this shit on reddit? 
@_date: 2018-09-12 08:19:42
Feel interest in crypto is all time low in long time and alts are just first that will sink before bitcoin does too. 
It will be reverse price correlation, till now alts fallowed bitcoin and now bitcoin will fallow alts. 
Just my feeling.

Its gonna go under 5800 than its gonna recover to 7k than again drop to new low. Rinse and repeat it seems. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:37:06
Two types of people one that buy Bitcoin and smart people.

You are to stupid to study anything, get your self a proper job and be prepared to work till you are 70.
This is just a friendly advice.

6k is not cheap.
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:35:14
Yea who ever listened to you and than put money in crypto, it might have not been even advice but it was enough to make them curious is now hating your guts and wondering if I put rat poison in his food will police find me?
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:04:32
Yes cheaper bitcoin is good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-23 12:17:08
This post and comments just shows how many dumb idiotic people are here. Just if I knew results of world cum yesterday today I would be rich. 
Well ofc. How stupid are you people?
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:07:05
When you see this comment you know there is still long way to drop. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 10:05:26
Man I was going threw some top posts on this sub and its fascinating going threw some of those bitcoin is going to be 100k a million. I'm going to be rich. What I'm going to buy plans and basically people thinking they struck endless gold. Some of those accounts stopped posting all together some never post anything connected crypto, some have last post of I given up and sold at loss/profit I can't do this anymore. Fascinating stuff. Most accounts don't have any recent activities on r/bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:59:16
No it has not. It never dropped from 20k to 4k. It never got global public exposure that my neighbor who does not know what internet is is asking me what this bicoin is and how can he buy those beecoins.
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:13:34
Who buys this bitcoin crap anyway? 
Well. Honestly mostly smucks, postman there are always postman.

@_date: 2018-11-24 07:23:37
You will learn that product does not need to change to go belly up. You can have a business that does great doing same service or product but after a while without changing anything just dies. Same for bitcoin, it can get better but its value can go down.

Remember hodlers if you sell you become weak hands and than you are in world of shit because hodlers are not allowed to sell without permission. 
Do you maggots understand?!

I know what bottom is. It's one digit and it's nice and round all around.
@_date: 2018-11-24 16:34:21
Than its time to sell not to buy. When my neighbors started asking about bitcoin I said any day now...it was about 15k than I was like this shit is nuts its gonna burst like a pinata. Didn't have to wait for very long lol...
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:45:01
I'm not sure are you aware of it but its 5600 right now...
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:23:55
Wow its sinking like a rock, every time that i refresh its going lower under 5900 now. What is happening?
Didn't even pay attention to crypto lately and seems when I checked on it I just stumbled on major crash.
EDIT:5700 now holy shit
EDIT: 5600 LOL
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:49:45
I would sell while you still can this will snowball totally to the bottom a real bottom. Mining cost are double this. GTFO before there is anything left.

Only way bitcoin goes over 20k again if aliens come and are fucking nutts for some bad investment. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:02:28
This is just stupid.

Wait till bitcoin drops to 1k than buy gold.

So we can prepare for future prices? ��������
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:44:28
Technically correct, we are closer to 0 than before.
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:26:27
not worth the 200$ maybe a dollar I would pay a dollar just as a goof to be a part of it in the end.

Sideways or straight into 2ks in 8 hours?
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:26:03
This is correct. It's in the news because people are losing money and there is panic so people google it. Not because they are looking to invest.

World is changing just like in marvel movies, also same reality.
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:29:13
dec 2014 it hit 1200$ nad than it dropped to 200$ and it took 3 years to get back to previous high. 
This time next year it might be 1000$ again or even lower after this FOMO dies. It might take decades to get back to 20k or some other crypto to take over and sky rocket pass that high. Don't know why people think bitcoin is the crypto that will stay for ever as front runner. Things sky rocket and than die and something else takes its place. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:50:08
But it has been copied many times over, there thousands of crypto currencies out there and some of them are arguably better than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:18:58

Which is 100% accurate. Just that they are not as intelligent and have no education or experience trading. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:11:36
I'm at this point certain that bitcoin will go to level before start of 2017 that was 800$ and if it hits that I'm not sure will it survive at all. Rapid price growth in 2017 might have killed it.
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:23:23
you mean there was no buy wall? that buy wall was drained 10 days ago when it hit this price. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 10:46:05
What no. Bookies don't calculate odds by past performance. Odds are adjusted by volume of bets on either sides of the bets. Bookmakers make profit by paying out 95%-98% and making money on margins. They don't care which side wins. They always make money.

Bunch of border line retards who root like bitcoin is their sports team. Think that constant posting of hodl and stupid analysis that predict bitcoin being 1mil this time next year will influence bitcoin value.

If it was so predictable everyone would make easy money.

In 2014 small amount of people knew what bitcoin was. Now it got global exposure and there won't be new capital coming in. Bitcoin is dead for very long time and maybe for ever. People lost their money and they got burned. None is touching bitcoin.

Lets get real it was not hard to recognize FOMO, as soon as first time hit 16k and it dipped every smart person should have sold at 15k and cry when it hit 20k because he would not own a single bitcoin.

Don't listen to people on here that are behaving like bitcoin is their sports team. Don't listen to idiots that post holds or its on sale or similar dumb shit. This people won't be here when they eventually cut their loses and you end up alone in the silence. Think with your own head.

Last time bitcoin was around this value there was pump and dumps every couple of hours for 400-500$ now biggest oscillations are 100$. 
Seems like bots given up on artificially pumping up price to dump it?
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:56:53
Man this last few months sure have cut down on hodl posts, last time when it hit 6k there was so many of them.
I guess many of hodlers sold or are so bummed out they don't even bother until there is 500$ pump than they squeal to the moon few times and go silence again. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:30:53
Are you blind? Check price movement last 24 hours its obv that price is artificially inflated.
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:45:14
Why would you need arbitrage when you can move the price on your own. It just happened price jumped from 6450 to 6800. If they  start a price climb they profit or if it starts downward they can control selling and sell everything before price reaches when they entered position. Only way to lose if same size large capital is playing against you but that is not in anyone interest. So everyone pays attention and when big money comes in everyone including small traders jump the ship trying to push the price as much as they can before shorting it again.  
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:23:59
This is good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:38:37
good moment for buying right now, there is some positive movement not including this dump. Buy and wait for pump than sell. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 10:29:37
Its like a hunted animal it has been shot and now its slowly bleeding...
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:46:26
We had 4 big pumps and zero dumps and downward trend, think its not that hard to conclude its pretty good time to sell before big dump comes.

500$ of artificial pumps, and constant downward trend. when bots dump it it will go to 6k in half an hour.

to tHE MOOON!
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:50:16
Nothing fishy at all, especially since it was long time since last artificial pump. This is great opportunity to sell for anyone that was looking to get out.

Can you imagine if this was actually true, it would just prove Jordan Peterson if full of shit (which I already know) and that you can have low IQ and have success in life.

Last time I have seen interview with this guy he looked extremely troubled. Probably in financial trouble and in debt. His predictions and words seem desperate to drive the price up. 
I think he gambled and lost. Probably all he had on bitcoin.

I would be shocked if it does not dip under 2k. My prediction is pre 2017 levels.

Still not anywhere near bottom I see. Lets check in a month.

What does it even matter what price is at, even if it goes under 1k. All that matters is that in a year or two its gonna hit million! To the MOON!

I can translate for spanish people. It means "Donde esta la biblioteca?"

You have a great reasonable point. How didn't I see it before. Going to sell my house and put everything on bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:30:24
If you didn't sell coming from 20k, might as well be in minus.

Obviously there is no such thing as standard in crypto world.

Even if I don't own any crypto its depressing reading and fallowing this land slide especially now with Christmas around the corner. Too many people got royally fucked. And even if its their greedy fault I guess its human to feel sympathy for people.

Well its not as RIP as people that bought bitcoin on credit when it was 19k. There was dude that took out savings and invested near top and it dropped 2k and he sold out saying he can't deal with it losing like 30% of his savings in 1 day. People laughed at him. I can only imagine if he listened to hodl morons that were laughing at him.
