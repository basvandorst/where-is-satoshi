OH-arbitraging no, not really it is an exchange but I guess the banker would have a lot of bitcoins that they might want to exchange as well, but I think this system could trade the ones that they take-in as well.

Well-it is the combination of the law re: (it does not violate anything in the guidelines), and a heavily regulated currency (stamps? no I have not heard of this 'till now)--AND the method does not violate that currency's law either, and some other laws like whether or not someone is in the money-exchange business.
Sorry to not spell the whole thing out but the I'm not sure what I want to do with this info.

I'm also a little bit blind ooops.

So-write a white paper type thing and then try to market it?
The idea is pretty simple and all I would have to do there is outline what laws are not being broken-the laws that would be used to try and shut something like this down.
I have a lawyer friend who I guess I could ask them to verify any non-disclosure appointments?
Sorry but after getting burned seeing other people win on my ideas, and no one that I know has any idea what bitcoins are, I just don't want to post the whole thing for someone else to use.

I don't know how to move this topic, but it should probably be in beginners.
That being said---I really like the idea of being the banker.
Or someone who exchanges btc for cold hard cash. 
So, the way that this is usually done from the way that I understand it is that I would take btcs from someone and give them cash? Is there normally a charge for the service?
Then I can either save the btcs, and if I need cash either buy something of value and sell that, buy whatever it is that I need with the btcs, or exchange my btcs with either an individual or one of the reliable exchanges?
This seems like a good way to buy these things in the first place. (sorry I'm so ignorant about this)

like I said I have references like the Wall Street Journal for one. (a "How did that happen?" article)
Some people are good at finding loopholes. I profited from that but other people cashed-in way more than I did because I opened my big mouth haha.- and they had more resources to use that loophole.
I don't even know what you would call a person trying to sell a "legal loophole"-idea! I just know how to find them.

The other problem is that in talking to the smartest person that I know about this, they refuse to learn anything about bitcoins-so I either have to step-up my learning curve on this and just try it on my own or find a business that is already invested in it.
Actually that idea about writing a paper has already helped me figure-out a few things.
