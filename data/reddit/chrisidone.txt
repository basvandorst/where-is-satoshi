Jesus guys easy with the fucking accusations. I've browsed about and still haven't found a single bit of any indication that this guy is doing something fishy. Just cool your fucking boats.

Hmm maybe send them an email with the browser and operating system you're using. I've just tried it and it seems to work fine (logging in).

Kids these days? haha whats wrong with liking dogecoin?

Thank you. We need to get all of these sites some attention and support!

You can always try localbitcoins.com

When I lived in south africa it used to take like 2 working days for bank transfers. 
There is an option for more 'instant' transfers but it's quite expensive (about $4).

Time to do some reading up. Thanks.

You know you're a bitcoin fanatic when... Haha 
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:34:41
Not a fan of the music. Gives the wrong sorta mood. Put on some DNB or something. 
Other than that nice work!
@_date: 2014-02-23 13:16:40
It should be optional imo. But basically if you create a new bitcoin address then theres not much identifiable information that can be linked with your account besides the email address perhaps.

Coinbase can make a payment to your local bank account? What? Seriously?

In a form of a QR code? Don't think it'll fit. (The visa logo has a non transparent background) - hence why I never made the bitcoin logo bigger.

Sorry I think I my message came accross wrongly, by 'people' I am reffering to exchanges. Surely english or rather multilingual support is a key feature for a bitcoin exchange.

@_date: 2014-08-18 13:12:59
Think I never made my point clear enough. My question is would there be any hardware 'bottleneck' if something like that or a rasberry pi were to run the current 'whole' bitcoin network as it stands right now (except with the difficultly lowered). Surely there exists some processing limit. And I my question is whether this is significant in any way.

Anything that is supported by Ubuntu would 99% be supported by Arch. In this case it's not really a matter of Ubuntu/Arch but more of individual software itself and or the graphical environment.
But if any new HiDPi features for any particular software it would be released so much sooner on Arch.

@_date: 2014-07-13 13:19:51
What about the 1% fees for localbitcoins? that shit is crap
@_date: 2014-05-13 19:02:27
Exactly. They're not very open about the fees if you ask me. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:08:21
Good question. I'm not aware of any formulas / theories. Don't think there are any though. There is allot of 'variables' involved. How much is $1 worth? 
Lets have a stone currency. There are 10 stones in circulation / total. Each stoned is deemed to be worth $1. Total value: $10.
Now I want a piece of the cake. So I offer $2 for one of them. Now the total value is $11 ($9 + $2). Now everyone thinks it worth more so they each deem it valuead as $2 each. So now the total value is $20.
So I suppose the total value of a currency is the cummualtive amount that each person values it. 
Hope thats helpfull! Good on you for thinking of these questions!

Do they only accept national deposits? 
Secondly you are quoting statistics for the language being your first language. A better statistic to quote would be the actual number of speakers.

Oh right, is that because I offended yourself and you aren't able to hit back with anything of context?

It's down to 12k now...There is 4x times more margin on USD.
Oh sorry for interrupting your circle jerk guys.
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:07:55
There are different routes to the some problems.
I agree through. Instead of of serving ads perhaps a form internet-revanue-network could be established. It's pretty interesting if you ask me, bitcoin is such an innovatine technology that perhaps we could soon see similar 'networks' using similar principles.
But yeah it's easier to defend yourself (adblock) then to regulate/enforce offenders (ads suppliers).
What a great time to be alive!

Pay for their merchandise? Eventually the vendor needs to cash out. But as more 'customers' develop,  the larger the amount of bitcoin grows in 'escrow' (not released till customers confirms that delivery has occurred).

They need to manually process tho payment I believe.

By handles what exactly do you mean? Does it retransfer the bitcoin back to your original address? 
@_date: 2013-12-23 15:02:06
With that same logic then, you only make a profit when you sell at a higher price. 
So you're saying everytime you buy bitcoin your instantly at a loss of whatever amount you spent?
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:14:51
Can you explain the 2 dimensional aspect to this? How are 2 fees linked together?

@_date: 2013-09-19 21:41:36
If you're not familiar with the bitcoin protocol it sounds like a understandable concern. Perhaps his not talking about the network 'going down' but rather a bug/exploit occuring for instance.

Exactly! It's so fucking infuriating. I'm 99% certain the dude said I'd get my account online in 10 minutes. Then when I spoke to another support person she told me that her college informed me that I need to go into the branch... 
Just shows how shitty banks can be. Probably spent 10 on mobile credit alone calling their 0845 number. Was quite funny - they gave me 3 'personalised' security questions which went something like 'let me know when I've spoken the correct answer'.
So it went like:

@_date: 2013-11-03 18:44:19
You might want to give those a read. They're both my posts.
Essentially: 
1. People starting a new 'blockchain' - all the benefits of bitcoin without the early adoption offset.
2. Distrust in who actually owns the bitcoin. Would you be comfortable if the government suddenly holds 50% of all bitcoin? They US already owns 5% confirm. And thats only from what we know.
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:42:07
My payments get through even without any fee... If i remember correctly as long as it's not a too small amount (&lt;0.01BTC) there shouldn't be much of a problem.
@_date: 2013-06-08 07:16:54
What do you mean when say 25% mining fee? You mean $0.25 in BTC as a transaction fee?

@_date: 2013-07-13 11:14:08
Excuse my ignorance but what are these? A bitcoin private key embedded in a valuable coin loaded with xBTC? Why would you do this?
@_date: 2013-11-02 16:50:12
I'm pretty sure they haven't. It's the default though - you'd have to send the $/btc directly otherwise. 
They also provide SMS (TEXT) services to release your escrows - so in the case that you don't have your smartphone/laptop around.
@_date: 2013-10-13 16:46:39
The best thing for Bitcoin would be for a country to create a global Ban-Bitcoin campaign haha!

So I'm guessing this isn't actually the price things were trading at?

I'll give you feedback on your 'features' list.
The features you list: 
Unlicence'd. (Oh, I was actually expecting to buy a license key / certificate - don't wanna be selling my drugs without a license...)
PGP based two factor authentication. (Should be handled by the user and not your self as far as I'm aware - how is this any different from normal encryption then?)
RSA encryption of private messages to store them securely in the database. (Ok - why should we care - your 'market' would use pgp anyway)
Client-side PGP encryption / Forced server-side PGP encryption if enabled. (Finally something that sounds interesting - perhaps show how it's provably encrypted clientside)
Image EXIF meta-data scrubbing. (A small feature...)
Bitcoin Escrow system. (Ok - more details would be nice)
Password protected pages (with timeout) for sensitive pages. (Oh k - why is there a  need for this?)
Live Exchange Rates to display prices in a users local currency. (Oh k - not really needed)
Ban/Unban specific users (Sounds reasonable).
Admins may remove listings (informs vendor why)
You've just listed a whole bunch of features that the majority frankly have no fucking use. It's not impressive at all. How the fuck are you justifying a 56BTC milestone? Who are you anyway - what have you done / built?
Frankly this just seems like a well 'marketed' bitcoin donation stealer. Please beware guys

This needs to be upvoted! Cmon guys!

Soooo what happened with all his bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-06-05 12:55:57
It's actually the site's theme/design that defines what a site looks like. :) Hence wordpress doesn't really have anything to do with it.

Actually with escrow the funds get 'released' immediately. So their is a need for them in some cases.

That doesn't directly answer the question though. I doubt transactions like those are created to drive up the 'volume' - unless they are some how unintentional?
@_date: 2013-06-02 09:11:18
I didn't even consider this. Its a risk though. I'd assume people would just cash in on their dumb mistake.

You can't deny the possibility. All I'm saying is there is no sense of 'trust' where the large majority of coins have been distributed to.

This might be due to the anonymous plus near instant transactions possible. Theres also I suppose a bit more risk involved (chargebacks? delays?). They used to be about the same price to bitstamp if I remember correctly though.

Thanks for the non-defensive reply! Seems like I've hit the wrong note with others.
1. Then surely distribution of 'wealth/cryptocurrency' should be a concern? 
3. A group of individuals that do not share empathy and are on top of the food chain - do I believe they exist - not really - I don't deny the possibility though.

Lets agree to disagree. 5% is a huge amount for such early days in my oppinion. This is only whats public - they could be doing something undercover - who knows?
And I'm pointing to the fact that who 'holds' bitcoin in their hands - doesn't have to apply to early adopters only. 
@_date: 2013-08-29 07:29:17
I don't have paper bank statements anymore, so I once had to verify my identity I sent a old 'paper' bank statement, passport and top/back copy of bank actual card.
What I forget was my bank statement had my old address (I moved to a new premises).
My account was blocked 10 minutes after sending them all that due to a 'discrepancy'. And they do not reply to any of my emails anymore... It's a harsh world out there.
Hopefully bitcoin has a solution for this type of situation.

Essentially I've made some good gains so I don't feel like potentially losing them. Secondly I discuss some bitcoin risk/concerns I have in that thread. And it made me lose confidence I suppose - lots of bitcoin fanboys here that are high on 'money' (or bitcoin right?) - no offense to them though - I was just like that for the past few months.
But do they possibly correlate with the vast amount of other bitcoin 'adopters'? Maybe.
@_date: 2013-09-08 18:01:22
So by 'it would be just as good' mean that it's 'proof' that a transaction has been initiated? Why then do vendors who accept bitcoin have to wait for 5+/- transactions before parting with their goodies?

I'm guessing it's a very risky startup though. Surely they need allot of capital? What if bitcoin goes up by 50% tomorrow? Ohhhh I see... And if it goes down by 50%... Ohhhh I seee. This is genious!
They can only lose as much as people 'invest' in them...

It's more likely to be a sizable amount of someones savings. Thats what my intuition tells me.

I emailed them a day ago or so. When buying bitcoins your order is guarenteed.  To quote the email:


@_date: 2013-06-01 21:11:08
I don't understand that anyway...
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:43:48
They're quoting the USD price of Mtgox. 
A pack of ciggerate cost less than $5 where I used to live. Over here it costs $15. Does it make sense for me to quote the price of $5 over here? No it does not. 
@_date: 2013-06-08 09:12:36
So did anyone else realize that this is basically allowing you to short sell bitcoin? :D
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:12:26
I understand. The guy could be legit. You could just be falsely advertising this guy who actually runs away with everyones money. Just saying people should be cautious and all.
Edit: It should be your responsibility to provide additional information to give appropriate credit. You could even be unaware that you're adverting this potential scammer.  BE CAUTIOUS THAT IS ALL. 
Sorry I'm a bit in a shit mood. My close relative has lost a huge amount of money to a 419 scam and I just 'found out' today...
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:42:51
Money isn't worth 'value' though from what I can understand - as soon as more is printed and 'spent' it devalues other money. You can't create more value with printing more money. 
The whole reason litecoin isn't at the same price of bitcoin is because everyone has chose to 'adopt' bitcoin. Everyone could cash out their bitcoin and buy litecoin and there would hardly be any actual difference. 
It's about all 'adoption' in my opinion. If it's suddenly revealed that the government owns 50% of all bitcoins people will just jump ship.
I feel my ideas aren't quite linking and I'm being pretty argumentative... One way of spawning new ideas though right?
@_date: 2013-09-13 09:33:11
Is it worth the risk though?
@_date: 2013-07-17 08:41:20

I'm sure there are more risks involved.

Well said. Sounds like a much more likely reason to my ears too.
@_date: 2013-10-13 16:26:11
? Did you just donate bitcoin to yourself?
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:24:13
See the one way to global bitcoin adoption is through everyones stomachs!
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:24:32
Exactly! Bitcoin is about a new currency. It's not about wealth.
@_date: 2013-10-13 18:07:08
Well thought out. Indeed dollars are more convenient to use for now... But I can only imagine Bitcoin surging in adoption with demographics like omegle / under 21s etc... Perhaps we'll have to wait a few years for these younger folks to start earning their own salaries and so forth?
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:44:59
Yes I agree. A miner is essentially just a middle man whos paying off the electricity company for bitcoins hashing cost haha... Cause he's getting his money back in bitcoins right? So his not loosing anything.

This can just as much be a good point.As long as the homeless person has the same address - and everyone can see that/verify that - it'll give incentive for them to donate to him/her.

Wait... So they gave out 3505 BTC to  Which just shows a "Faucet Closed" page?

Yes my question is why cant I use then? Are they not synomonous? 
@_date: 2013-08-13 15:23:35
Can anybody explain what is happening here? Is th block time dynamically changed? 
If it's been halved then does that mean theres 2x the amount of bitcoin being mined compared to before?
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:40:48
Scam. Someone posted a thread about it. Might want to give it a search. Essentially they have no benefit for having your coin on there - unless of  course it's a scam.

When you give them cash they charge you a deposit fee yes. Aswell when you draw money out they charge you too (it's cheaper to get money out an ATM rather than a bank teller too).

If bitcoin's price goes up - someones wealth is going up aswell. Whos wealth are we increasing - those that hold bitcoin. Do you really want to give one concentrated entity enormous buying power?
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:28:48
I can't find the exact link but I swear I remember seeing the 5% figure (600k). Perhaps it was only them 'seizing' but not actually getting the private key and all. If anyone finds the infos/links please post below.
Anyway I'm just trying to debate / put thought on potential risks on bitcoin. Nothing personal - just clearing the air! :)


I was reffering to "Not that any of that has anything at all to do with your sour grapes original post."
Early adopters are just an example of potential large 'holders'.

So essentially people are just 'bitcoining' out of mtgox... Interesting...
@_date: 2013-08-09 11:32:11
I guess the fact that it's not anonymous that you use encryption... So possibly being put on a list or god knows what.

An example of this attack:
You initiate a trade, and the seller sends you this link:

Hmm I suppose it's not said very well. The joke involves 'that bmw' implying it's a single object and not a company/entity.
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:34:27
Obviously I realize that. Lets put this in more real world terms shall we?
If we have a forex exchange in the middle of Antarctica and it has VERY HIGH PRICES. Does it make sense to quote it's prices in the middle of say new york? NO IT DOESN'T. It's two different markets. 
@_date: 2013-08-05 22:58:51
Can somebody please explain what I'm looking at?

And sorry  I misunderstood the question I think... I guess I assumed naisanza thought the backend was the reason the site looks the way it does.
Or I assumed fruitcommander assumed the site looks the way it does because of wordpress.

Thats enough brain crunch for one day.

Or it could just plumit even lower and take months to recover back to even the current price. Just like it did when it hit a high of 266. It took more than 6 months to recover. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 15:02:33
It may be a sizeable amount of this guys savings.

Shit I just bought a bigish sum of bitcoin... How bad is this?
@_date: 2013-05-31 20:23:13
Uhhah. Bitcoin has been very stable these past weeks though? I'm not saying it's been stable for ever..
@_date: 2013-08-08 18:06:17
I usually search for 'bitcoin' in random threads and give it an upvote. Oh yeah!
@_date: 2013-08-04 10:46:43
Jeez I totally forgot about this thing! Should have hit the front page before!
@_date: 2013-10-24 20:02:01
Gold nuggets have 'value' to them however. Bitcoins are like a new type of crystal that can be easily diveded/traded/teleported. But suddenly what stops us from adopting just another 'crystal'? Everyone could decide to start a cryptyocurrency that only starts mining in 2015? That poses risk to bitcoin. 
It's for this very reason that I'm cashing out today. I'm really sad to see my post being downvoted and plenty of defensive replies.
Do I see cryptocurrency as the future? Yes. Via bitcoin? No. Perhaps someone should give this some thought.

@_date: 2013-05-16 07:14:58
Doubt it'll be successfull. Is there any market for this? 
It's a plus for bitcoin though. If googles rolling out the shizz perhaps people will feel more comfortable with digital currencies.

Buy a few at a time? Can you clarify by what you mean - I'm curious.
It was small amount anyway (0.25BTC I think).

"This is the expected behaviour, my paper wallet now contains 0 bitcoin, and the receiving address contains 5BTC.
This time, I am going to send 1BTC to an address from my 5BTC wallet, and keep 4BTC in my paper wallet for later. "
You just sent 5BTC from your paper wallet... Now there should be 0BTC on it. How on earth do you now send another 1BTC from it?
@_date: 2013-12-21 11:19:59
Ouch what if that private key gets compromised...
@_date: 2013-10-24 20:50:59
I'd say the price is 'inflated'... It's slowed down with the ups so. I'd wait it out until the price is a bit more stable...  Right now you are having plenty of people jumping on board to earn a quick buck. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 09:20:22
And you've been down voted because?????  
@_date: 2013-11-02 14:38:30

What exactly were the bailouts? How did they effect the account holders in these banks?
@_date: 2013-06-09 07:32:05
Maybe cause people are starting to sellout their bitcoin from ASICS?
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:55:30

@_date: 2013-06-02 08:51:32
Can someone explain to me why they would do this? Surely they'd get more for their bitcoin if they spread out the sell sale over a day or so?
@_date: 2013-09-30 18:01:01


You mean private key right?
@_date: 2013-10-03 20:09:33
That is essentially what I was asking. Last time I tried I couldn't use the amazon.com voucher on amazon.co.uk
If anyone knows of a solution for this please let me know. Thank you by the way - doing a great service for the bitcoin community!
@_date: 2013-09-06 08:02:43
Ease of access/familiarity I suppose.
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:06:24
Is there any difference if I buy one bitcoin today at 685 or one bitcoin tomorrow at 1000?
Sure the first option costed me less (or earned me less - depending on the way you look at it). But what does it mean for Bitcoin in itself? 
Whats a more interesting / accurate description of Bitcoin being adopted:
1. Half of a cities transactions are all done in bitcoin.
2. 1BTC = $10,000,000.
You state 'purchasing power' but is that really what bitcoin's worth is valued at? 
Let time stop. Now let everyone value their bitcoins at half of what they previously valued it at. Has the purchasing power changed?
Lots of thoughts running
@_date: 2013-11-10 11:08:59
That isn't really my point. It's just informing the uninformed that without weighted averages it'd be pretty easy to drop the price with small successive transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:27:13
I just read the top comment. Didn't see it previously. 
No hard feelings!
@_date: 2013-05-24 10:47:50


Why should I ever need to change my bitcoin address?


I've already downloaded my wallet from blockchain.info. Why would I need the Bitcoin client?

Ah! I hold a bank account in both countries so that problem doesn't affect me. So you'd have to use localbitcoins and trade for cash only.
@_date: 2013-09-08 17:53:31
It shouldn't matter weather I or anybody else has a copy of the private key. All that is required is for the person to create a transaction using that private key for the funds to go from that address to his own.
And surely once a transaction is 'sent/submitted' it can't be revoked?
@_date: 2013-09-16 20:27:06
Same here! Big up for localbitcoins!
