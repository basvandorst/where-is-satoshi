On another note, sort of contradicting myself here, but what’s everyone’s opinion, if the the economy were to crash again, I wonder how the bitcoin market would react.

Lol I don’t have the patience, over the last few days I was checking the price every half hour or so. Although it’s always awesome to go to bed and wake up the next morning to see bitcoins up 500$.
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:34:13
I understand that, but with bitcoin is seems like it’s way more unpredictable than the regular market.

Is it possible the bow string was being pulled back when it was near 3000?
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:19:38
Exactly how I feel, I don’t have much invested in alt coins anymore, but I can’t transfer my ethereum to Coinbase.

Boom called it yesterday, I am now a bitcoin expert.

So we’re still over 12% in the last week, and every big gain this this month has been followed by either a small dip or a large dip before it rebounds a little and settles in, and then has another large gain. In an earlier post I said something along the lines of how it’s not really like a regular market, and people are constantly changing their positions after a large gain or loss. Going off almost nothing whatsoever, I’m saying it’ll hit 9,000$ within the week.

Pretty sure that’s the guy I was talking about.

Really the only correlation I can see is that it’s almost the same as it was this time last year. That was before it tanked.
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:27:45
Yeah I have absolutely no idea where it’ll go. I just said it would hit 9k within the week, based off of nothing what so over, except for looking at the charts and seeing the lines going up.
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:43:45
Yeah I’ve noticed that, even with coinbase, it really sucks because I’d like to know right away when a coin drops below a certain price. An actual alarm that would wake me up would be killer.
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:21:44
Nope. They’re under going maintenance on the wallets after some stole 40.5 million dollars worth of bitcoin last week.
@_date: 2019-05-15 01:26:55
Thanks for all the suggestions I’ll give them all a shot.

In the last few weeks has anyone seen an accurate prediction made by an “expert”? I read an article from a couple days ago where someone stated it would stay at 5000$ and not break 6000$ anytime soon. I get the feeling that the trends are almost meaningless. Although I feel like if it hits 10k it’ll sky rocket from there, but that’s just me being optimistic.
