In the late 70s and early 80s, the USA was facing stagflation. A recession with growing inflation. The Central Bank had no choice but to raise interest rates or face hyperinflation. Gold went through the roof.

Bitcoin is known for its volatility. I believe the reason for this is even though it has been around for 10 years, it is still going through price discovery. When the volatility slows down thats when we'll know what 1 BTC is really worth. Do I think 1 BTC will be life altering in 10 years...yes.

true, but I took the completion of 1 market cycle in gold, compared to the completion of 1 market cycle of bitcoin. I didn't just find a random segment of gold's price. The point I guess I was trying to make is that Bitcoin's market cycle is over and a new one is beginning.
