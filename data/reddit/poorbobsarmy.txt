Storage wise: if you're only buying $5 a week then you can just keep it in an electrum wallet, once you get into the high hundreds then a hardware wallet is your best bet - almost as secure as it gets and very user friendly.    
Your plan sounds good, but honestly if I was you I wouldn't buy now.  Price is volatile and going down, whether or not it's to do with this bitcoin cash shit is unknown.  There are 100k backlogs so you will have to wait a while get your bitcoin in your wallet etc.  Personally if I was you I'd wait a couple of days until the dust has settled

Maybe he has bots.  Maybe he needs fast liquidity.  Maybe his full bitcoin holdings are much more than this.

You should know that whatever answers you get in here, if you go to reddit.comit will be the exact opposite.  At this point the community is pretty much split into two religion-like sectors at war with each other

Also pretty much all the other 'stable' altcoins that you could invest in  are at or near all time highs, so it might not be a good time to buy anything!  That said though, personally I think that if you're starting out the most important thing is to actually get some skin in the game and start figuring out how to navigate cryptos.  Ethereum and Litecoin in particular are relatively safe bets as far as cryptocurrencies go, might be good options if you don't wanna wait out the bitcoin drama

3rd party wallets are just individual wallets - unless you specifically try for it, they won't aggregate all your wallets or passwords.  Hardware wallets are usb sticks, and you use chrome apps or similar to control them.  Much more secure than they sound though!    
Re: bitcoin cash shit: this is a simplification, but basically bitcoin cash is a hard fork (like a copy, but slightly different) of bitcoin, and the community is split into people who believe either one should be the real bitcoin.  Bitcoin cash has been surging in price (went from like $300 to $700 in a few days) and over the last 12 hours has jumped up to $1300 while bitcoin has been falling.    
Some people think that a powerful group are currently battling i.e that bitcoin cash is trying to stage a takeover of bitcoin.  This might not be the case, but either way it's an extremely uncertain time to jump into bitcoin

Maybe people are shilling their coins because all the alts are on the up at the moment and people are excited and trying to keep the pump going?
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:05:45
Yeah I misread, thought OP wrote altcoins in general, didn't realise he was referring to bch and was implying a large-scale attack that included shilling all other altcoins

It's not quite that simple though.  This drop is accompanied by the extremely sharp rise of a coin which some people think will become the 'new bitcoin'.  I agree it might be (probably is) just standard bitcoin variance, but there's definitely more reason to think something's up now than there was with previous dips
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:54:02
It's definitely possible both can flourish, it's all very uncertain at the moment.  A few of the big figureheads pushing for bitcoin cash have made statements saying the current bitcoin currency will be all but dead soon, and the standard 'attack' narrative right now is that a group controlling a huge % of the hashing power (i.e mining power) is migrating to the bitcoin cash blockchain (whilst simultaneously pumping the price of bitcoin cash) in order to pretty much kill bitcoin.  Alternative narratives are:    
-on the opposite side: this is simply a huge scale pump and dump of bitcoin cash, and the dump is coming.  bitcoin is not at risk  
-bitcoin cash will be the 'asian bitcoin'.  sorta makes sense because the group that is heading this bitcoin cash mining thing are mostly Chinese
Bitcoin right now has 100k unconfirmed transactions in its backlog so (unless you pay really high fees) transactions are taking 30 mins+ to go through.  Bitcoin cash has more mining power than bitcoin for maybe the first time ever.  I for sure wouldn't be buying as a first time buyer right now

This is totally a guess (I've only done an undergrad major and haven't worked much with blockchain) but I'd say it'll be more about specific classes you take.  Obviously cryptography (through whatever department it's offered, at my college it's math), machine learning so you're able to develop for more sophisticated projects, and if I were you I'd personally try to get at least a minor in math or stats.  Unless you can read the Ethereum yellowpaper and understand it no problems.

A limit order is an order that will only be filled at a predecided (by you) price.   Just as a precursor, there are market makers and takers - makers set prices taken by others.  So, on GDAX you'll see the order book (google if you can't find it).  You'll see in the middle the highest bid (people bidding to buy) and lowest ask (people willing to sell at such a price).  There is a gap.  Let's say it is:    
Ask: 1.5  
Bid: 1.4    
Right now nobody is buying or selling, because of said gap.  If you press 'market' when you buy, you'll buy for 1.5, you are 'taking' the ask price of someone.  But if you instead set a limit buy order of 1.41, your order will now be the highest bid.  The next person who comes in and presses 'market' to sell, will buy off you at 1.41.  You will have paid no fees, because on this transaction you were a market maker.    
 
Let me know if you need any clarification!

When you set liquidity-providing orders (i.e higher/lower bids/asks than anyone else) you're a market maker and certain exchanges (finex, for example) charge less fees for those trades.  GDAX has 0 fees for market makers

There is nothing stopping you, and if I had access to a country with that sort of difference I'd be all over it.  But yeah it takes time to move money, and I assume there's some risk in terms of either the exchange not being super reliable or your country's banks not being on board with it all.    
South Africa had an insane difference (10kUSD when btc was 6k USD) a while ago

They can, sometimes.  I can't remember the name but a marketplace lately that accepted both bitcoin and Monero (much more private) was bought down because the feds tracked the bitcoin trails.    
But there are also things such as bitcoin mixers (google if you need to).  High tech criminals often know what they're doing so it'd be pretty hard to trace them.

You probably don't need to get out of btc for this (because it's probably not real) but the rumours could definitely create some interesting market forces because all traders have it in mind.  Could be a real interesting day
