Isn't it most likely that US Govt will introduce some form of FEDCoin and forbid every other coin? So they can keep financial control over"circulating money". They just need to forbid banks to accept money from fiat exchanges, that should be easy since there are only a few of them. If you want financial freedom you have to restrain the power of governments what will not happen in countries that are wealthy (the huge struggle would seem just "not worth it"). What happened in China and what starts in Russia now is just the prelude. Because these countries don't are democratic they are able to move quickly on this. However when Parlaments got on this bandwagon once it will be similar.

So bitcoin won't happen in china and india anytime soon (like at least 10 Years, if ever). Great perspective...NOT.

crypto is doomed, if one asshole can manipulate the market in such a way that happened, how can you really considering putting your money in this system? Its just crazy.

i used the app for a smaller purchase and can recommend it. Basically its as easy at it can get.
The KYC-Procedure happens via video-chat and took some minutes. There is an interesting "crypto-radar" in place which monitors tweets regarding bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and ripple and measure how many tweets have been sent in the last 24h and what the current mood of the discussion is (positive/neutral/ negative).
Crypto withdrawal from app to your own wallet is no problem. They claim it can take up to 3 days until the bought crypto is send to the extern wallet. However in  my case it took about 4-5 hours.
Currently you can only withdraw fiat when selling some crypto you have bought with the app in the first place (there is no crypto-deposit function available).
It is planned in the future that you can deposit your own crypto to the app, sell it there and withdraw the claimed fiat.
One Downside is that the fee's are kind of intransparent: There are no fees, they make money with the spread between buy/sell prices. However the actual spread is nowhere shown. But i think Coinbase does it the same way (not sure)

Running a full node on the smartphone is obviously a bad idea for the user, since it eats up all his storage. why would anybody consider doing this, aside from some bitcoin maximalists? Blockchain should be practical to use. Storing a whole Bitcoin-Node on your phone is not practical in any way. In fact as much I would like to have a "Blockchain-Phone" im Not sure I would buy such device that would reserve over 80% of its storage capacity for Blockchain. Maybe Bitcoin is the wrong for this, mimblewimble based blockchains takes up only a fraction of space
