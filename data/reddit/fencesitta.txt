There is a connection. The movies stars have commented and contributed to work in the space.

there's no bullshit in the article. it just shows Reeves and Winters (Bill and Ted) have acknowledged and worked around the bitcoin industry. I think you just take posts on the internet too seriously.

Good call
@_date: 2015-06-24 04:22:03
they claim they are better and cheaper faster more reliable than Bitcoin.  That is the only reason. Obviously they are tryna use the bitcoin thing as marketing. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:49:15
that all makes sense. good explanation! But I can see how with all the confusion already, the phrase "internet of money" prob doesnt clear much up for a lot of people.

Nice shirts.

he is pretty adamant about no contracts of any sort in interview. do you prefer coindesk? 
@_date: 2017-02-13 19:12:04
probably no one used it on fiverr.
@_date: 2014-07-23 17:50:43
I used one of these machines. They seem to be the only potential true "bitcoin atm" or are there others??

u so high
@_date: 2016-01-10 05:38:52
bullshit.

Nothaus actually put the symbol of the US dollar on his Liberty Dollar, which makes the two cases not exactly comparable.

Thiel, Balaji perhaps, who else?
@_date: 2015-09-07 07:08:16
Yes, but sometimes Google lets scams trend to the top. Just wanted to be sure.. Thanks!

What is your policy on Press Releases
@_date: 2016-07-16 21:40:54
how the world works...
@_date: 2016-07-22 01:02:13
this is neither. this is evidence of her elitism. 
@_date: 2016-07-21 18:28:17
she is an elitist. she thinks bitcoiners are immature. yet, she wants them to form a cult of personality around her. she's a sociopath. do you even know the definition of gossip?
@_date: 2016-07-16 20:33:32
this is true.
@_date: 2016-07-21 18:23:52
this isn't gossip. this is the truth of how the self perceived bitcoin betters view the flock.
@_date: 2016-07-18 18:39:09
they've been around. i can see their point.
