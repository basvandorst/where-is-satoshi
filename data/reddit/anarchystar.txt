Well, I had the impression pretty much everyone was on board for BIP101 (except for the majority of the core devs, of course). But again, my whole point is, there was/is only one way to find out: To have the core devs stop controlling the party line, and give the user choice back to the user. Noone will object, if miners, merchants and users can implement what they see fit. Maybe devs will object for no longer holding the King's Crown.

Andreas is right. Meanwhile, they even suspended member elections (which were due next month), due to "budget constraints". Go here to read my final statement I made about the Bitcoin Foundation. 
I pasted it here for your convenience:
Ladies and Gentlemen, this is how freedom dies.
The first thing I told everyone after I was removed from the board, was that they should not expect any elections anymore. I fully anticipated a final power grab to take place. It seems my prediction came true. The excuse that elections take a lot of time and money, is obviously a convenient lie. You have (or had), plenty of volunteers to do that.
The real reason behind this whole charade? On december 31st 2015, 2 board members would have ended their term. At that point, it would have been a 4 member board (In essence: Jim and myself, vs Brock and Bobby). This would have produced a change of power dynamics, and at a minimum would require consensus instead of a 4 vs 2 situation. Behold, it might have finally broken the old boys club's power!
Planned or not, the fact that I was removed from the board for a sham reason, resulted in destroying whatever credibility the Foundation had left. Noone in their right mind would join a board that removes members, unless gravely warranted. A faith that not even Mark Karpeles suffered, after he performed possibly the biggest crime/theft in Bitcoin's history. Need I say more? Posted Image
Anyone joining the board at this point (elected or not), will merely be a puppet.
Bruce, I am also disappointed in you, for creating a rhetoric that it was the Boards fault, and that nothing has happened because of infighting. I think you have gotten all the liberty to execute whatever you saw fit over the last year. I also think it is inappropriate to insinuate I was actively going against the Foundation. You know all too well, that I went out of your way so you could succeed, even if I had my doubts that the Foundation's reputation could ever be restored. If anyone ever wants to verify that, you can read the minutes from the last 6-9 months, which outlines all the board meetings we had.
Bruce, I'm asking you to wake up. The board just turned a member ran(!) organization into a dictatorship. I'm sure you think Brock and Bobby are doing the right thing, but at this point it is all about ego and abusing whatever power the Foundation's name has left. You should not take part in this, I know you are a good person. The members haven't paid for this charade. If you have any honour, you would give them their money back. I will even help you to pay for it (individual members).
To the members: The board apparently measures "member satisfaction", by counting how many members actively resign. (you'd think they'd measure the amount of new signups instead). My reply to the board was that probably noone even bothers to send that letter anymore.
Still, out of principle, and as my final act, I hereby resign my lifetime membership to the Bitcoin Foundation. Don't bother with having me send a letter, that's just a hoop you put in place to make it more difficult. This post will also be the last thing I ever have to say about the Foundation, because honestly, I think everything has been said (and I mean that in the broadest way possible).
Let the curtain fall.
Good night, and good luck.

You mean, everything that goes against what Bitcoin Core decides as a group, becomes an altcoin. That's your definition of power right there. You calling it an altcoin, and saying it's OK to be banned. My definition of "modular", means we can get rid of all that bias, and we directly vote on BIP's and similar, by pointing to a certain port in a pool. And yes, I know "theoretically" this can already be done, and a pool could run BIP101 on port x, and XT on port Y. My proposition here, is that Bitcoin Core unites ALL developers, by having them propose changes to put in Bitcoin Core. But instead of you deciding what goes into 12.1, users that run nodes and miners can decide from the command line which features to enable. For example, 4MB blocksize, LN, etc. So you don't have to make controversial choices anymore, we do. We, the users, should have that power, and not the developers under the "Core" label, calling everything thats not "Core" an altcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:17:04
My goal is to unite all devs under Bitcoin Core, instead of requiring different competing versions. The user will ultimate decide to activate the feature a dev adds.
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:58:56
My BIP proposes to make Bitcoin Core more configurable on the command line. Instead of devs deciding what is active (like RBF), I propose we give the user the option to enable/disable this. That's more than worthy of a BIP proposal, and completely in line with BIP1's guidelines. If you doubt that, I will start pasting BIP's so you can compare.
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:08:40
Also note, dear people, that Nodes and Miners are one and the same to Satoshi. The excuse of nodes vs miners has been used as a way to split the debate. Miners should care about running nodes, noone else.
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:22:10
I'm fully aware. My proposal would just make it easier for the end user to choose, instead of having wars between XT, Core, etc. Bitcoin developers can just unite under 1 version, and add features. If there is anything controversial, users can decide from the command line, instead of having the choice between dictatorship XT or Core.
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:47:25
Yes, of course, you can switch client. I never disputed that. My goal is to not have to switch clients, and end all these wars and censorship.
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:50:30
I think you misunderstood. My proposal would allow miners to decide what blocksize to support, and which features to activate, on the command line, instead of having to follow whatever Core Dev mandates will be in version 12.x
@_date: 2015-12-27 03:16:54


No, you, under the pretence of following the communities desire (which you clearly do not, hence the whole debate). The community at large already decided on BIP101 in the summer. Any argument you make about that not being the case, is another argument for making it modular.

If that was true, then the 1mb would be full of spam/fake transactions today. It's not.
@_date: 2015-12-27 02:46:25
False. People speculating are investors. They give it value by wanting to buy it. Even without a single merchant, or the prospect of ever having one, bitcoin can still have value. Same thing with people who just want to use it as a temporary exchange vehicle to send money abroad. Even a merchant itself can be considered an investor. Also, this is the reason why devs should stick to what they do best: developing. Let the market make the market decisions. Make Bitcoin Core modular (with modular, being the definition I have meanwhile clarified in the topic).
@_date: 2015-12-13 15:14:12
Sorry, I basically copy/pasted this from my twitter :) 
@_date: 2015-12-27 16:09:11
Exactly. Thanks for that. And the added benefit is that devs can focus on creating code instead of having to deal with deciding what they think the market wants (they cant). They can make proposal based on input or demand, but the community ultimately decides to active them.
@_date: 2015-12-27 10:50:38
You just single handedly pointed out everything that's wrong with Lightning, and why it's completely insane that the Cult of Core added something like this on their roadmap overnight :) Reddit gold for you. Also ask what happens to everyone's Bitcoins in transit when LN fails or is ever reversed.

'An investor is a person who allocates capital with the expectation of a future financial return'. Almost everyone that buys Bitcoin today, expecting it to go up, is an investor.

See my other reply to you here 
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:14:15
Command line / config options (with default recommended settings). Nodes vote like they do today (95% required for checkblocktimeverify activation), etc. Nothing really changes, but you can decide to support a feature or not, inside the client, instead of having to follow a mandatory version system where devs decide for you.
In regards to further discussions:
That's why I created the BIP, to get input and solve those potential issues. That will be hard of course, as I'm not even allowed a platform on the dev mailing list! (thanks to btcdrak, who gatekeeps everything)
@_date: 2015-12-28 03:04:23
Check out my proposal here 
@_date: 2015-12-29 01:04:37
I wouldn't want to give more power to nodes, nor miners. Everything stays as it is today. That includes the potential for Sybil attacks, with or without this idea. Noone is stopping someone from booting up 10k nodes with an evil version of Bitcoin. 
The only difference is that with my proposal, nodes and miners can decide on features from the command line, instead of having to follow whatever comes mandatory in version 12.1. Right now, they can only choose to not upgrade, or switch to a competing client. Competing clients are banned from discussion. Uniting all core devs under one client, and having open conversations enabled again, would go a long way. The final decision maker is the node/miner anyway, so why not just make it more convenient for everyone?
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:48:42
"which features make it into Bitcoin CORE", which is the main client.
Bitcoin is already a majority rule. 
My goal is to unite all devs under one client (Core), and give users the power to decide directly under that client, instead of having XT vs Core wars, etc. They will still listen to the devs, but they can make choices much easier. Right now Bitcoin is defacto centralized under Core, because it is inconvenient to switch. You will get censored discussing alternatives, or banned. If everything is under one client, users can freely debate without repercussions.
@_date: 2015-12-17 10:09:11
The point is that it would be costly and economically unsustainable to fill the 1mb. Ok, so you are worried about 10mb? 4000 bitcoins. 100mb? 40,000 bitcoins. See my point?
@_date: 2015-12-27 21:49:15
Exactly. And we can just do it under Core, but with modules/alternative versioning, for the real controversial issues. This will solve this whole debate once and for all. Core devs shouldnt hold the final decision in what makes it into 12.1 
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:23:17
Everything. You either have to live by the rules of XT, or by the rules of Core. My proposal just gives the choice to the user, and thats it.
@_date: 2015-12-22 09:17:16
Hardfork or softfork is irrelevant and confusing, and this policy will come to bite you (and Bitcoin), in the ass later. This basically means we should not have been allowed to discuss core for a long time now, cause some BIP's contained controversial hardforks. You say: "If the situation surrounding this Bitcoin Core statement was reversed and Core was supporting a hardfork even though there were several people like Gavin against it, then I'd have to start deleting promotion of Core from I will bet you $1000 that if the devs had decided to do a hardfork to 2MB, and Gavin would have gone against it, and said we need to fork to 8MB or the network will blow up, you would not have banned core from being discussed. Theymos, your argumentation has been flawed and is unhealthy for the Bitcoin system. Very unhealthy. If you look at history, oppression of healthy debates, even on contentious issues, has always led to bad functioning societies (and in the end, dictatorships).
@_date: 2015-12-17 09:50:22
That doesn't matter. The point is noone is filling it artificilly today, cause its too expensive to do so. The bigger point is that, if you would remove the limit altogether overnight, nothing would happen at all. There wouldn't be a big spike or sudden larger blocks. Bitcoin would just be able to continue to grow, and maybe a year from now we *might* hit 2mb.
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:44:41
Everyone that has a serious economic interest in Bitcoin would obviously run nodes full time, and happily pay for it.
@_date: 2015-12-27 02:51:47
Well, then you only have it activate when there's enough consensus in the network. It's being done with soft forks today and can perfectly be done tomorrow (such as with the BIP101 hardfork activating on 75% after date x). I have the feeling you are more concerned with giving away "Core decision" power to the public. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 09:32:04
I ment fill it in a spammy/artificial way.
@_date: 2015-12-21 02:44:52
Far from true. As I said, I'm done with the Foundation so I'm not even going to bother setting the record straight. I would just like to respectfully ask you to not say things I didn't say, or take them completely out of context in a weak attempt to justify it all. You are better than that. I'm surprised by you personally though, that you are so easily politicized. Totally didn't expect that from you. You also know the current board members don't represent the wishes from the membership anymore, and on top of that you just suspended the upcoming elections. Common Bruce. The Foundation just became a banana republic. And you also have pretty much zero legitimacy abusing a name that has standing with the press because they think you represent Bitcoin. Don't you have any honour left? And I'm really done talking about this. You can find my last statement here: 
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:39:35
If we can't get core to give important feature decisions to the users, maybe unlimited will ;)
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:18:00
All the reasons to make it easier for users then, by having core implement command line options. But that would give their power away, and create direct democracy. Dictatorships dont like that.
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:52:33
That's awesome. If you really make features/blocksize configurable on the command line instead of devs dictating what will go in next, you will have a winner.
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:29:16
Can you explain how it introduces centralisation?
The reason why I'm passionate about this issue, is because in 2010 I signed up and invested in a Bitcoin without a block size limit, which had as its goal to support more transactions in the world than VISA. Without having to resort to Lightning Network or other things that would no longer make Bitcoin what it is today, and remove the incentives for miners on the long term to keep supporting the network. If everyone transacts over Lightning Network, the mining fees will pretty much vanish. I'm all for having LN being done on an altchain, but making it part of Core is a different story. I also question the legal status for people involved. There are several other reasons, but I did not sign up for a Bitcoin with a size limit that will force everyone over intermediaries (and introduce centralization). I can go on for a while. Add to that the blatant censoring of any dissenting opinion, and yes, I'm not going to beat around the bush much. Oh yeah, and the decision to do SW instead of following most users wishes to go to 2-4-8 or beyond. Betting the house on SW and Lightning Network when we might hit 1MB next week, does not give me any confidence on the current direction of core dev.
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:14:49
In regards to the technical solutions, can I remind you that it was clearly submitted as an early draft, and request for plenty of input? BIP1 states that you should discuss your BIP on the mailing list first, and get input, corrections, advice, etc before you submit it as a final BIP. That was exactly my goal.
In regards to 
a) Can you clarify?
b) How would this introduce a Sybil problem compared to today?

*BIP stands for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal. A BIP is a design document providing information to the Bitcoin community, or describing a new feature for Bitcoin or its processes or environment.* 
I submitted a new feature, called "making features configurable on the command line", combined with a process change, where devs no longer decide what gets activated in the new version, but users do. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:24:30
Everyone already holds that vote today. They can switch to a competing client. I'm trying to unite devs under one branch instead of having the whole community fight XT vs Core. If they don't agree, they can release different command line options, and the users can decide in the end, without having to fight a war.

Generally, it takes about one year for Civil Rehabilitation Proceeding.  The court has not yet issued an order initiating the Civil Rehabilitation Proceeding.

Under the Civil Rehabilitation Proceeding, each creditor has to file proofs of its claims with the court and will be treated equally (i.e., he/she will receive distribution on a pro rata basis). As such, within the context of the Civil Rehabilitation Proceeding, there is no class action. Assuming arguendo that prior to the court’s order to initiate the Civil Rehabilitation Proceeding there were class action lawsuits against Mt. Gox, such lawsuits would be suspended.  That being said, we are putting together a consortium of people to act as one creditor.  This will make our demands much more powerful, and will allow us to make requests and remarks to the supervisor immediately.

1/ The Lawfirm asked us to not disclose their name at this point.  We are setting up a Consortium (soon) and will disclose the name to anyone that wants to join.
2/ We have not filed a lawsuit against Mt. Gox yet (it's not allowed right now).  We have filed certain information with the court and are assisting the Supervisor (the trustee in the future) in the Civil Rehabilitation Proceeding currently pending in Japan. We obtained the application for commencement of the Proceeding filed by Mt. Gox but there is no other document so far. In other words, the court has not issued its order to initiate such proceeding. We have also filed a criminal accusation paper with the Shibuya Police. They may officially announce in the near future that they have received such criminal accusation paper.  
3/ As stated above, we will not bring a lawsuit against Mt. Gox within the context of the Civil Rehabilitation Proceeding. After the court decides to initiate the Civil Rehabilitation Proceeding against Mt. Gox, each creditor can file proofs of its claims.  However, we will file tort cases against Mark Karpeles as an individual in the meanwhile. We are also putting together a consortium of creditors to be more powerful in making demands.  More details on that soon.
4/ We are currently funding everything ourselves.  It will be possible to join our group in return for 20% of any possible recovery.  Half of that will go to the law firm directly in order to represent everyone.  The other 10% will mostly go towards (hopefully) paying back their hourly fees that we are fronting ourselves.
5/ Our law firm is Japanese and we have a very close relation with the supervisor.  We are also the biggest creditor, so we have the highest priority in making demands.
6/ We agree, and are pushing the supervisor for this.  The bigger our group becomes the more power we have, and the more serious they take our demands and criminal charges.

I don't agree that letting people incentivise requests with money will have a small group taking control.  Remember that everything is transparant.  The developers are still free to do what they want.  Ultimately it is also up to the bitcoin users themselves to decide which software they will run.

We just group-sign certain requests to the supervisor and have my law firm hand that over.

- Very unlikely, there is too much debt and most assets are worthless.  A restart of the exchange seems impossible.
- Same as above, nothing of worth remains.
- The Supervisor has the right to ask Mt. Gox to disclose its books. Karpeles has a duty to explain. We believe that the Supervisor has already exercised that right.  The Supervisor will not disclose the results of investigation.  Once the Supervisor suggests Mt. Gox to disclose its books to the court, the creditors will have access to such books.

Since a temporary restraining order has been issued, creditors cannot withdraw their bitcoins unless the court makes an order initiating the Civil Rehabilitation Proceeding and permitting Mt. Gox to run their business again or if they go bankrupt.  Bitcoins are converted into currencies and creditors receive payments with currencies.

At previous MtGox trading levels, we estimate it will take 1-2 years.  People will remain shareholder forever and take part in profits from the beginning. We do intend to make the shares tradable. That means people could get their balance back even quicker if the company gets valued highly enough.

The guy sitting on the left, is Jim Harper, Bitcoin Foundation's Global Policy Counsel.  Cato is known to be in bed with government.  I haven't seen the rest of this, but an anti-Bitcoin guy giving a presentation in the same institute where Jim Harper is residing, does not give me a good feeling.

If Mark Karpeles, the debtor in possession (“DIP”), is arrested, Mt. Gox will become unable to be operated by its DIP.  In such case, there is a greater possibility that the court would find it difficult to continue the Civil Rehabilitation Proceeding, and would issue orders discontinuing such proceeding and initiating bankruptcy proceeding under its own authority.  That being said, the chances of MtGox surviving are already practically zero.  The debt is too big and what remains is worthless.

We have no knowledge yet as to whether 180,000 bitcoins were in fact moved by Mt. Gox.  Since the temporary restraining order has been issued by the court, Mt. Gox is prohibited from exchanging and/or using any bitcoins or other assets.  
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:21:20
Q: Was mt gox required to list all bitcoin holdings in their bankruptcy filing, or could there be more unreported bitcoin holdings?
A: Bitcoins controlled by Mt. Gox need to be listed in its asset list.  The current asset list submitted by Mt. Gox to the court does not include any statements regarding bitcoins.  
Q: How will depositors holding bitcoin in mt gox be treated in comparison to holders of fiat deposits? Will they have equal standing or will they be treated as second-class after fiat holders?
If bitcoin holders have equal standing, and repayment were presumably to come out of mt gox's remaining holdings being mostly fiat, is it known what exchange rate they would receive for their bitcoin holdings?
A: Creditors have equal standing and receive payments according to the amount of their claims.  The court will decide the rate to be used to value bitcoins. 
Q: If court decides that mtgox has to pay creditors with remaining funds, how would that process work? Specifically when it comes to bitcoins? Will an arrangment be possible where anything above X amount on someones account is not refunded, and the rest is shared between creditors, or will everybody get the same percentage refunded regardless of amount of btc/usd?
A: In the Civil Rehabilitation Proceeding, creditors will file proofs of their claims after the Proceeding is initiated.  When a rehabilitation plan is confirmed, creditors receive payments according to the rehabilitation plan.  When the court makes an order of discontinuance of the Civil Rehabilitation Proceeding, creditors receive payment in the bankruptcy proceeding that follows the rehabilitation proceeding.  We believe that bitcoins are converted in currencies and creditors receive payments with currencies not bitcoins.

The 20% is something completely open to discussion.  I have already fronted like 30k USD in lawyer fees, and I expect this thing to go on for a year.  I can try to push the law firm to work only hourly and not charge a %, and then hope we can get enough people to chip in (and disclose the invoice every time we get one).  But I don't know if they will agree to it.  Any suggestions are very welcome, as always.  The most important thing is that we all act together and have some sort of group, or alternatively - that every creditor files his own claim, combined with us making an echosign system on our website in case you want to rally behind a certain proposal.

We filed the report, as mentioned in 
You are correct that our advisor at that time reported the total amount that moved.
Below is an excerpt of our letter to the court (some of it is still classified)
Pursuant to the February 28, 2014 temporary restraining order (the “Order”), Mt. Gox is prohibited from disposing of its assets.  From February 26, 2014 no access is allowed to the bitcoin exchange (the “Bitcoin Exchange”) created on Mt. Gox’ website, and nobody can exchange or request to exchange bitcoins deposited with Mt. Gox except those who are authorized to access to the Bitcoin Exchange, such as Mt. Gox’ CEO.
However, a website of Coinsight.org shows that several requests (the “Requests”) for withdrawal of large amounts of bitcoins were made at Mt. Gox’ Bitcoin Exchange from March 7, 2014 through March 10, 2014, which requests could be made only by those who are authorized to access to the Bitcoin Exchange, such as Mt. Gox’ CEO. 
As you know, due to their extremely high anonymity once the bitcoins left from under the control of Mt. Gox, it is in fact impossible for Mt. Gox to regain them.  Also, to the extent known to the public, the Requests were repeatedly made in quite a short period of time last weekend with respect to at least 530,000 bitcoins, which represent 70% of 750,000 bitcoins which was allegedly held by Mt. Gox.  This fact shows that there is a risk that Mt. Gox might hide most of its assets in violation of the Order, and we believe that such act not only causes difficulties to the Procedure of Civil Rehabilitation but also constitutes a fraud under the Civil Rehabilitation Act.
We therefore ask the court and the supervisors to supervise the proper preservation of Mt. Gox’ assets and to confirm the facts mentioned above and act accordingly.  [censored]

Q: File emergency petition with court under Article 30 of Civil Rehabilitation law to restrain MtGox and Karpeles from deleting their database.
A: Since the temporary restraining order has been issued under Article 30, no additional petition can or need be filed. The fact that Karpeles deletes the database may constitute a crime of spoliation of objects concerning the status of the business and property, etc. under Article 259 of the Civil Rehabilitation Act, and such deletion is prohibited.
Q: File petition with court under Article 30 to order MtGox/Karpeles to reopen website and allow logins, so that everyone can check their balances and trade histories and people can at least prove their losses to their tax authorities.
A: As mentioned above, since the temporary restraining order has been issued under Article 30, no additional petition can or need be filed.
Q: File petition to open bankruptcy proceedings against MtGox (not allowed/stayed under Article 39, but should be filed anyway so as to immediately open bankruptcy once Civil Rehabilitation is closed as hopeless).
A: As stated above, if Karpeles, the debtor in possession (“DIP”), is arrested, Mt. Gox will become unable to be operated by its DIP.  In such case, there is a greater possibility that the court will find that it is difficult to continue the Civil Rehabilitation Proceeding, and will order discontinuance of such proceeding and commencement of bankruptcy proceeding under its own authority.
Q: File petition to not open Civil Rehabilitation because there is no way anyone will trust Karpeles with anything anyway.
A: We have been providing the court and the Supervisor with information to facilitate a decision to initiate the Civil Rehabilitation Proceeding thereby preventing the DIP from disposing of any assets of Mt. Gox.  Also, we are considering cooperating with the criminal investigative authorities if necessary.
Q: If Civil Rehabilitation is opened, file immediate petition to discontinue under Article 191, since it is obvious that there will never be a majority of creditors supporting anything Karpeles proposes.
A: It is possible to cooperate with the court by, for example, providing the court with information useful to it in deciding whether to initiate the Civil Rehabilitation Proceeding, and we have been doing so.
Q: File criminal charges for violation of Article 259 against Karpeles for shutting down the website, thereby spoiling proof of account balances and trading histories.
A: Since Karpeles is suspected of violating Article 259, the Supervisor is now investigating.  
Q: File criminal charges for violation of Article 255 against Karpeles for concealing MtGox property by transferring it to undisclosed Bitcoin addresses, as well as moving funds from those addresses over the last weekend.
A: We think that the requests made during the period from March 7 through March 10 with respect to withdrawal of bitcoins from Mt. Gox constitute a crime of fraudulent rehabilitation under Article 255 of the Civil Rehabilitation Act, and thus have provided relevant information. 
Q: File criminal charges for violation of Article 960 Companies Act (Aggravated Breach of Trust) against Karpeles for taking bitcoins belonging to MtGox and holding them as his personal property.
A: We suspected that the requests made during the period from March 7 through March 10 with respect to withdrawal of bitcoins from Mt. Gox might constitute an aggravated breach of trust under Article 960 of the Companies Act, and thus have provided relevant information.
Q: File bankruptcy petition against Karpeles.
A: It is possible to file a petition for commencement of bankruptcy proceeding.
Q: File criminal charges against unknown "hackers" alleged to have stolen bitcoins, so as to have the police step in and find out what actually happened to those funds.
A: Although it is difficult to file a criminal accusation without specifying the hackers, it is possible to facilitate the investigating authorities’ investigation.  However, since Mt. Gox may use the hacking as an excuse, we need to be careful about this matter.
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:15:33
The Supervisor has the right to ask Mt. Gox to disclose its books. Karpeles has a duty to explain. We believe that the Supervisor has already exercised that right.  The Supervisor will not disclose the results of investigation.  Once the Supervisor suggests Mt. Gox to disclose its books to the court, creditors will have access to such books.

Thanks for your questions.  I don't want to alter the core of Bitcoin.  It became successful by being what it is.  It would not be fair to anyone that is invested in it.  That's why there are altcoins.  I believe the market will (and already is) solving most of the issues you mention.  I also think Bitcoin is still evolving and has seen great developments in the last years (multisig, BIP32, checklocktime).  Blockstream recently collected 21 million USD to enhance Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-04 12:32:59
I think it's always a good time to buy :) I've only decided to sell a lot once and that's how my BTC got stuck on MtGox.  Later on I succeeded in selling a good bunch through bitstamp instead.  It was an interesting story, cause it was several million worth.  I informed my bank upfront and they agreed to look at the case.  I showed them proof (by signing with my wallet key) that all my Bitcoins were mined (and not obtained through silk road for example).  They accepted that.  So did bitstamp.  I've invested a lot of that money back into Bitcoin by supporting various startups.  I'm also still holding some, but they have been timelocked well into the future, so I can't access it myself even if I'd want to.  This prevents me from being tempted to sell + gives full protection from theft or being forced to give them up.  I can't elaborate on how the timelock works but it's not that hard to lock a piece of text to only be released in the future.

Insider trading is completely legal for currency pairs AFAIK.  From what I've heard its big business to trade insider information from government employees on, for example, USD-EUR pair.  So if it's not regulated in the current markets, it should definitely not be regulated for Bitcoin.  Also, if you do want to regulate it, I would highly recommend to start a private regulatory agency and refuse to trade + put public pressure on all Bitcoin exchanges that do not want to work with it.  That is how self regulation can work.

I think we are complimentary (and there are 2 board seats available ;).  My goal is to make sure the Bitcoin Foundation doesn't hold any centralized power over Bitcoin.

I think the foundation should just help promote Bitcoin and create awareness on how to fund development, while not having control in either of those areas.

I agree with your remarks.  It's a bit of a chicken and egg problem.  I have no intention of outright firing any core devs employed by the Foundation.

I do want to use the Foundation's platform and website to help make that happen, and expedite moving them.

Hey BIGbtc, thanks for your questions and I think it's great you feel the same way about creating Bitcoin awareness.
1. I would definitely support the Foundation informing everyone about Bitcoin.  As long as it is done in a manner which does not give the Foundation any real control or influence over Bitcoin itself.  Educating, spreading awareness, creating incentives for adoption, and creating information packages for interested people and governments is something I can fully support.  
2.  Yes, and I think that if the Foundation really becomes as neutral and positive as it should be, then I think businesses and individuals can wear the Bitcoin Foundation Sponsor badge with honor.  And it would have a positive effect on their sales and reputation.

I'm not a tax expert but if necessary they create a non-profit and collect the crowdfund through that.  I'm also sure they can collect enough money to not have to bother with organizing one every month. It's a lot more important to be politically independent.  Through a crowdfunding platform the user can directly pledge support for the features they want most, instead of the Bitcoin Foundation deciding who and what to fund.

I think you misunderstood the intention. This platform merely enables you to donate to a core dev of choice. Right now, if you want to send money to Gavin, Wladimir or others, you can't (short from contacting them personally and that's a huge mess for them to deal with). Yes they could publish a btc address on their twitter instead and keep a public ledger. They could do this and that and much more, but from my talks with some core devs they don't want to deal with all that, they just want to get a steady pay. And the goal of the platform is to provide a method to do that, without them having to do anything. It will also create a universal way to donate to someone, and to see how many donations they have already received. It also allows companies to showcase that they donated (good for their rep). If some core devs want to take Bitcoin directly, I don't have an issue with that either. But what if you want to give them dogecoin or pay them per commit etc? So this platform could make it possible to organize x different methods of donation without the core devs needing to bother or assist in receiving them. The trustee would just collect and take care of it. 
In regards to devs voting, Gavin explicitely said on bitcoin foundation forum that he does not want that burden. Nor should ge get it, it creates a political nightmare in dev land. If you want to donate to all core devs under criteria x, set up your method and promote it. But at least this platform will allow you to do so, cause you will be able to select a recipient.

Hey Jeff,
Thanks for your points. It's a lot to address but I will try. First of all, in regards to the trust fund, this was a suggestion. It's good to have a debate and find the best way once and for all. A trust fund per dev is totally ok with me, etc. 
My issue with the Bitcoin Standards Body is the Bitcoin Foundation being behind it. I cannot share everything I know yet, cause I'm worried about legal implications. But in an ideal scenario the Foundation envisioned itself as being the place to fund to support core dev. What that would lead to, I don't have to explain. They wanted to hire many more core devs in the future, launch a standards body, etc. While I have no issue with a standards body if that is what all the core devs want, I do have an issue with the Bitcoin Foundation paying many core devs + having a Standards Body under it. I hope this clarifies a lot.

They redacted these minutes heavily in their favor, so I will release the (properly) redacted ones very soon. You will be surprised. Also, the fact that Jim proposed to vote both of us in as ED, has nothing to do with me releasing the info or not. I could care less about being an ED.

Gavin is one of them. He told me in person and also in public I'm sure. He posted this yesterday on the bitcoin foundation forum:
I still think the best way to move forward with core dev funding is some type of not-for-profit legal entity, whether that is Olivier's crowdfunded Trust or something else (or both) I don't really care. I DO care that it is legal, transparent, and that I'm never put in the position of deciding how to divvy up a Big Pile Of Money. That puts me into a clear conflict of interest, and would be a very good way of generating resentment and envy among the core devs who aren't working for their own startups.

Here's my rebuttal:
- 'The Foundation is not bankrupt nor have there been any discussions regarding a potential bankruptcy. As with other bitcoin companies that hold bitcoin, the drop in bitcoin price drastically affected the Foundation’s bottom line as the majority of assets were held in bitcoin.'
I said it is as good as bankrupt and has almost no money left. I never claimed they filed for bankruptcy. There have been discussions on it being insolvent (or a potential bankruptcy), Patrick even mentions it in his proposal: "To continue funding an engineering team within the Foundation we will need a significant infusion of cash or potentially be insolvent in ~8 weeks" (That was over a month ago).
- 'In the last board meeting, the management team presented an austere, yet clear, path forward for the board. The board of directors voted on March 31, 2015 to proceed with the strategic plan and to work out a communications plan to roll out the decision along with the finished annual report for members and the public. That strategic plan proposed by the management team was to be rolled out this week.'
This is a lie. We only voted on firing staff. No plan was approved. The board minutes will back that up. To quote Patrick "The only thing that we’re voting on in this vote is to reduce cost by cutting headcount.".
- 'The Foundation also did not fire 90% of its people. The Foundation holds the majority of its assets in bitcoin so when the price of bitcoin dropped last year to under $400 and then held steady in the $200 range, tough decisions were made to trim down programs and instead, focus on funding developers working on the Bitcoin Core Protocol. This meant downsizing our team as the Foundation could not continue supporting the full team. Some team members left voluntarily and agreed to continue helping on a volunteer basis to help the Foundation during this financially austere time.'
So it's not 90%, is it 80%? The point was that most of the staff was fired, and yes some were kept as volunteers as I mentioned.
I see a pattern of blaming everything on the falling Bitcoin price. I don't think that's going to work.

- How do you deal with quality vs quantity? In dev work, a simple line of code could be the reflection of months of work vs 20 lines taking just a couple of hours.
- Gavin and possibly others want to get paid by a "real company" and get their check in the mail every month and not have to worry about IRS and special tax filings. We need to take care of that too for them to accept this.

I would say that we try to have every dev prepaid for a minimum of 1 year, and have them get a monthly paycheck of a fixed amount. So for example if his proposed salary is 150k, he would get 1/12th of that every month.

Not sure if you're trolling or not. This is not a centralized structure. The Trust is just a way to donate directly to a developer of choice, and have him receive that money easily. It has no function beyond that, and should not have. In an extreme scenario we can setup 1 individual trust for every developer, but that might be a lot of overhead. But if necessary, that can be done.

- I used the phrase "effectively bankrupt" in the same post where I said "The Foundation has almost no money left" when clarifying the items.
- 90%, 85.2%, you want me to make a mathematically precise calculation? Most of the staff was fired.
- Irrational? When I joined the board I learned they were virtually bankrupt. I had the choice to go on with the charade while they were still milking money from their members. Your argument is that the members should have know? How? The fact that everyone is up in arms right now is because it was not news that they were almost broke? Right. You would have preferred me to just sit back and play along and continue the non-transparency? Make no mistake, it was not going to happen, no matter what they were saying. There was always an excuse, Jim and myself tried to get transparency and I asked the board to take responsibility for their actions, but I got threatened in return (with a deadline I might add), so yes, I went public.
- I never said Mark Karpeles tried to get someone killed. I said Mark Karpeles made a dead threat to an ex-employee. I have a copy of the actual death threat evidence which was filed with the Japanese police. I know it was filed because the ex employee that filed it used my lawyer. After I posted that information, someone sent me the original email and the headers turned out to be possibly false. I had the honor to correct that. I did not publish anything a news agency wouldn't have published. The better question to ask would be who was not telling the truth?
- Yeah, I said I would resign, I'm not the one who started the Brock comment, I was just one of the guys that followed in line. So don't put that one on me. I did not end up resigning, cause in the end I realised that would restrict me from being able to speak my mind on the Foundation forum, which is members-only.
- Yes, I offered $100k of my personal savings to help fund a decentralized crowdfunding platform. Are you actually saying that's a bad thing? And the reason it was delayed was not my fault, Mike took longer than expected, maybe if more people would have helped test him it would have gone quicker. And 
- I ran for office under a platform to create transparency and decentralize core dev. You honestly think I would compromise my values when I found out they had been hiding the financial truth, and were now planning to pivot into Foundation 3.0 and re-start the foundation under another name, without telling anyone?
Some other things I did:
- Mtgox owed me $5 million USD and 1 week before they announced bankruptcy, my Japanese lawyer told me I should have their bank accounts frozen and put a claim on that money. I refused to do so cause I did not want to damage Mtgox and the community. If I would have only cared about myself that day, I would have been 5 million dollars richer.
- I paid over 100k in legal fees to keep those who lost out on mtgox adviced on what the options were. 
- I invested over $2 million dollars in various Bitcoin startups.
I'm definitely the bad guy here.. I think I should resign.

That's exactly what I'm trying to create here :) 
The reason to create this entity is that I've heard from several core devs that the reason they don't want to deal with going to the community is because they have to deal with IRS, marketing, etc.  They want to have stability and just develop.

Ok guys, next time I will just stay silent and become corrupt like everyone else. No problem, life is much easier that way.
@_date: 2015-04-06 00:03:24
Did you actually read my post? :)
Item number one says: Any core dev can join the trust fund TODO: Define what qualifies as a “core dev”, because someone doing code review can also qualify as such.
@_date: 2015-04-06 00:07:29
I've heard of trusts that can't be changed once they are created. The letter of wishes will be followed and thats it. If you want to have something else, you will need to create a new one.

No, its far more complex than that. Like I said in my post, I was voted in on a platform of transparency. I do not think it is ethical to hide near-bankruptcy from members you are still collecting money from. At that point you have the option to go along and be silent, or speak up. This is not about winning or loosing a vote, this is about the ethical thing to do. And yes, we tried to vote on transparency etc but things kept getting postponed. Noone wanted to release the truth until it was "convenient".

I disagree, core devs need to make a living also. The fact that a core dev gets paid, or paid more than another core dev, does not mean his code should be included or accepted.

I would say an independent Trust company, that manages trusts on a daily basis. They will get the above instructions and abide by them. I'm not an expert on trusts so please correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2015-04-06 00:19:28
Tell me how something like that cannot happen today? The "1%" can go and make Gavin and 10 other core devs an offer of $1 mil per month each. That is totally irrelevant to the discussion we're having here. 
@_date: 2015-04-04 05:52:16
I think Gavin was dragged along in this, and he just wants to do his job.

I'm not giving them anything. People are donating directly to a core dev of choice. This trust makes it easier to donate to a core dev of choice, because it prevents the core dev from handling IRS issues etc. 
The only difference between donating directly to a core dev without this trust is that in the case without the trust, the core dev will have to deal with IRS and other issues directly. Nothing else.

I can confirm that with improperly redacting I ment they removed important information from the original minutes.
@_date: 2015-04-10 12:56:44
I can vouch for these guys.

I changed the word "trustee" to "trust administrator"
