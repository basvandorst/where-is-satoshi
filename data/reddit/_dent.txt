I have just written to Nedbank informing them of SB competitive edge and asking when they intend integrating Bitcoin. I suggest other SA bitcoiners should contact their Banks also.

A BOUNTY WEBSITE where people can propose something should be created (eg A new plugin for skechup or a teleporter). A Bounty address is then created (multisig address which gives the contributors voting / signing rights. Developers / creators will then try and make the thing and the bitcoin will be released if the contributors (or % thereof) are satisfied with product.

Thanks. I will look into what you have written and try to apply it. Essentially i have a small business and want to give clients the option to pay in bitcoin. But invoicing law where i am states that invoices must be such that they are numbed in a provable consecutive sequence. So the options are pre-printed numbed  invoices or invoicing service on the web or invoicing software program ... all of which cost money and don't allow me to accept bitcoin. But i will do some research and see if what you suggest will work.

Is there any service that exists where i could do this? I am not sure i understand how to hard code a sequence (bit over my head) but thanks for your comment.

im thinking something along the lines of: each block is consecutive and each blockhight has a unique hash. So is it possible to insert the blockhight hash starting with the genesis block into your invoice and then putting the hash of that document onto the blockchain?? would this do anything ... im not smart enough to understand \ think it through it properly.

yes, if tracking coins is possible it will happen. whether it is to track 'tainted' coins, try to recover stolen ones, or to determine how wealthy someone is. and probably many other reasons I haven't thought of.

real time price adjustment according to demand would be a possibility. 
i.e. 1bitcoin is worth a computer ..... if 100 people want computers 1bitcoin is worth 1/100 of a computer.
