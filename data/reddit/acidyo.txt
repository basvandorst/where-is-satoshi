Can you tell me next weeks winning lottery numbers while you're at it?
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:44:26
Yes, OP did not question that, his point was something else entirely.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:53:06
It's on ATH now though.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:19:03
lol, at least let people get their bch first.
@_date: 2015-12-09 18:35:16
I swear I saw a 180k users thread the other day, maybe they removed it now. :D
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:17:39
How is it more tacky than a toaster? Do people give out bitcoins all the time at weddings?
Or do you just on purpose say the opposite of what everyone else thinks, like your username being the wrong way around even.
@_date: 2015-06-19 01:59:31
Pocket thieves pocket things.
@_date: 2015-12-09 18:36:29
So basically you are trying to save as much of the wasted time you are spending here, sounds fair.
@_date: 2015-06-18 23:57:58
And even if they are, who cares?
Who cares about the ones that laughed in the face of the ones buying magic internet money in early 2010? No one. :)
@_date: 2015-06-20 19:59:46
Don't we have enough of posts about the movie Dope already?
@_date: 2015-06-20 18:26:05
Yeah but compared to the other 99% of weddings, bitcoin isn't something close to a toaster.
@_date: 2015-06-22 13:43:41
Shouldn't this one: 
be 50 btc at 0 and then decreasing as it goes up? Seems the wrong way around, the block reward.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:42:27
This guy should know what he is talking about. :)
@_date: 2015-06-22 15:45:11
Choo choo!

Here I thought I could see dead people.
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:53:27
Changetip is the future! I have a smile on my face when I see it spreading all over the internet. :)
@_date: 2014-03-17 05:59:07
Great! Could you repost the wallet address for me real quick?
@_date: 2014-05-13 11:27:42
Woah, sweet. The changetip picks up edited posts even? That's really cool.
I'll spread these around different subreddits. (since I do browse reddit a lot, as you can see from my comment karma) So later I can feel like I helped when r/bitcoin reaches half a million subscribers before 2015. ;)
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:06:30
Then he tried with pouring starbucks on it.
@_date: 2014-05-20 14:28:44
Price is rising at an insane pace right now, 4.3% daily change on bitstamp at the moment.

JESUS CHRIST!!
@_date: 2014-04-25 20:52:57
Omg, now that I look more at the chart, what if I was one of the few who bought just at the right time (316.5€) and from here on out it's all but up. ;)
I impressed myself
@_date: 2014-05-15 09:00:53
Did you just get a tip through by just mentioning the tipbots name and the amount somewhere else in the post? I can see how accidental tips could be common with that method.
@_date: 2014-05-23 12:13:14
Why do I never receive such high tips. :*
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:16:30
@_date: 2014-11-14 12:14:44
Just a little bit apparently.
@_date: 2014-05-15 09:06:01
Why can't I receive an erection without a penis?
@_date: 2014-03-31 07:22:34
Which explains the jumps.
@_date: 2014-03-04 10:10:03
Did you get the coins back without needing to verify for a higher tier?
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:46:09
Holy shit, I haven't seen that many zeros in a tip since :D
@_date: 2014-11-11 12:32:27
Did you just tip yourself? Or what happened here. :O
@_date: 2014-11-06 12:54:32
250 bits @_date: 2014-05-13 10:08:45
You are really on a roll lately. :D 
@_date: 2014-11-06 13:01:45
Try looking how many people have googled or youtubed bitcoin the last week. Results are quite impressive. :)
250 bits All I got for now. Make sure to spread it around so we can continue this trend. ;)
@_date: 2014-08-16 21:27:39
Your saying he should just mix his bitcoins up a bit before donating them, got it.
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:15:28
This here: 
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:38:03

Oil was starting to run dry.
@_date: 2014-08-13 11:40:42
Gambling with bitcoins is like gambling with gambling. You are already gambling about the value change of bitcoin, leave it at that.
@_date: 2014-04-14 05:32:38
@_date: 2014-07-14 11:33:08
Chances are high no one got it. It was a good promotional bounty though.
@_date: 2014-04-25 21:46:41
Nice! I used to gamble a lot, managed to make 15 btc, had to cash them out though to help my parents pay off some debts (500-600€ pricerange) but managed to save 700€ (have also quit smoking this week), so every small amount I save, I store it up a bit and then buy btc with it. :) It's something I would've lost anyway while smoking, and I think more people should quit and do the same. :)
Wish I would have done this earlier though, or heard about btc earlier than november 2013.
@_date: 2014-04-25 20:57:52
I agree, this has to happen, we need to dumb the fuck down, people.
@_date: 2014-11-20 20:31:58
Haha, thanks but why was it funny? :D
Edit: also thanks for using private to keep the page less spammy. :)
@_date: 2014-10-10 06:56:47
Indeed, I started watching that on my phone not realising how long it was, around 1h30m I noticed I should've gone to bed an hour ago but watched it anyway til the end. I love his views on cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:12:04
Fuck you Leah, goddamnit.
@_date: 2014-05-13 11:39:06
This is the time to use our bitcoins and show them that we actually use them and not just hoard. :)
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:59:13
So brave.
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:33:33
I think it works on every subreddit. :)
Edit: you don't need the quotes. :D
@_date: 2014-11-13 10:17:49
Congratz! that's worth around 4500$ right now. Let's check how much it will be worth in 2 years. :)
RemindMe! 2 years

Ahh, I see now. Cool function!
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:09:05

@_date: 2014-04-16 15:03:13

@_date: 2014-11-06 12:55:58
This is the biggest tip I've seen in a while. :O
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:55:48
@_date: 2014-04-25 21:51:52
Hahahaha omg, this was awesome!
Had to check if you were a novelty account that did that, someone should start one!
@_date: 2014-05-15 10:59:47
People who have mined a lot in the beginning and still have access to those coins will dump them all at once and kill the price.
@_date: 2014-08-13 15:19:12
Like a chatroom?
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:43:56
Awesome post! Great read! I do agree with a lot of the things you talked about. 
Tipping is basically giving someone something for free, and waking their interest in what this is. I'm sure over 90% of the people I have tipped on reddit the past year haven't minded it and were actually thankful and interested in what bitcoin is.
I have been doing this thing where I randomly tip people with good posts in different subreddits for over a year now. I really think a small % of the 140k subscribers we have here today are thanks to my constant commenting everywhere and tipping. My karma amount doesn't lie. ;)
@_date: 2014-11-14 11:55:52
Your sentence says the opposite.
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:44:21
I can vouch for Likashing! 
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:55:01
That's what she said.

Sorry to have to point this out but my ocd went bananas when i noticed it.
Found a small imperfection on the M on Nakamoto. It goes through the lines. :P
@_date: 2014-05-13 10:18:51
Are these even real tips? I don't see any getting confirmed.
@_date: 2014-05-23 12:05:40
Damn. Can't they go and hack the fbi's coins instead of good people?
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:35:11
Oh, that's pretty cool! Yeah, would really need the fiat on my account by friday, hope I can still make it by then somehow. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 23:16:58
How much are 1000 bits?
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:40:49
You have a typo in there. :)
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:45:03
All time high profits? Are you kidding me?
Of the 1% house edge the site is sitting on a 0.26% profit. Very all time high indeed.
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:13:55
Just wait for support to look into your case, I guess.
@_date: 2014-11-04 14:38:58
Same here, unemployed. :D
@_date: 2014-01-17 18:15:15
@_date: 2014-07-04 06:37:12
It's more about the experience for people new to mining. Where they can follow each block and see how shares work, etc. :)
@_date: 2014-11-11 12:52:24
There even is a fee in it. Weird, wish i could help you out more but I don't know much more than you do, I'm afraid.
@_date: 2014-04-09 23:44:53
A *whoopping* 13 btc! Nice!
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:29:26
It's not a scam. Lika has given btc to random strangers over the last couple of months. Just cause you are misinformed doesn't mean this is a scam. Don't start accusing people when you apparently don't know anything. :)
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:03:18
He will just follow the chain.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:44:35
Where can one by shares?
@_date: 2014-05-13 12:43:17
Oh, I misstyped, I bought 2.1 and as mentioned above I gambled my way up to 2.5, sorry for the confusion. :) From now on, no more gambling and only saving. ;)
@_date: 2014-03-04 09:30:12
Thanks, welcome to reddit.
@_date: 2014-11-13 10:19:54
What ad? I just saw the OK GO video that made them famous.
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:37:44
Also, my account is apparently not frozen since I just deposited 0.8 and it showed up. But no sign of the 5 btc I have deposited on saturday, only "evidence" that I have actually deposited those is that the "monthly limit" shows 4500/10000$. And the transaction ID obviously.
@_date: 2014-11-13 10:33:05
Also, people should know about adblock by now. :P
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:06:41
750k is a lot of coins.
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:49:00
Imagine changetip usage over fb for christmas.
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:28:05
Indeed, I was almost on my way to try one of these when I was about to cash out. Turns out you can only buy, same thing goes for the ATM of the bittiraha kiosk. A bit of a letdown so I went with kraken instead.
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:03:55
You should become a journalist.
@_date: 2014-08-10 17:00:33
Oh yeah sorry, forgot to mention mobile compatibility will start working first on the weekend according to the owner. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 09:12:47
What if I want it there though? ;)
@_date: 2014-04-25 20:58:28

@_date: 2014-04-25 21:35:02
Haha, that was awesome!
@_date: 2014-11-06 12:53:39
Tipping is the way to go. I've been tipping bitcoin ever since the old bitcointip bot and then started tipping dogecoins since day 1. I am very glad to think that some of the 140k followers are here today cause I frequented the rest of reddit now and then and tipped people who made good comments. :)
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:53:14
Alright, willing to give the information to verify for next tier, just concerned that it may take a couple days longer. Was planning on withdrawing it to my bank account today so that I would get it by friday, but due to the lock on the 5 btc it's not looking like it's going to be possible now. :/ Unless support will read the ticket today and unblock the btc in time. One can hope.
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:30:19

I don't see what it had anything to do with bitcoin nor the title, though.

The glass-doors reminded me of [this clip.](

Thank you! Will take a look at it. :)
@_date: 2014-05-15 09:46:44
That's one too many for me to handle, lol. :D but thanks, is 1 bit 0.00001?
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:15:18
Ohh, haha I commented at the same time as you sent me this. Thank you for the fast answer and help!
@_date: 2014-07-18 07:39:54
Haha, is that slushs pool?
That's where I mined summer 2013 for two weeks before I gave up. Too bad I only had a laptop to mine with and never made the required amount to withdraw. If anyone wants my account with 0.001-0.002/3 feel free to ask for the details. I don't have an asic so it will be lost forever.
@_date: 2014-05-13 14:58:53
I told my younger brother to change the password, make a copy, give it to my parents to save it somewhere hidden and to never tell it to me unless it's an emergency. :)

Did you try turning it off and on again?
@_date: 2014-08-13 13:47:00
Hey! lol, so random seeing you here too.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:02:14
I'd spread them around like Oprah, go on a crazy raining spree giving away whole bitcoins to users in the subreddit, etc.
750k is too much btc for one person to hold. If I were to cash out all of it, I would never cash out more than 50 per day to try and not affect the market as much as possible.
Or just hold them for a long time, people think they are "lost" or whatever, sell some every now and then but keep most secured.
Here I go again, daydreaming.
@_date: 2014-04-25 21:59:55
How does it not have more views? Is it the real account?
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:50:30
Alright guys, I doubt he is the one that makes the decisions what to report.
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:26:48
This sounds highly unlikely.
@_date: 2014-11-13 10:16:20
I guess banks don't like the saying "if you can't beat them, join em." 
Oh well, in 10 years it will be their own undoing.
@_date: 2014-05-13 11:56:01
Hahaha, I was also confused by this. What use will he have with btc on the sea? Pay fishermen with btc in exchange for food?
This makes a lot more sense now.
@_date: 2014-11-02 22:37:27
I would love some. :)
@_date: 2014-05-15 10:52:41
Because I've been a big bitcoin supporter ever since I read into it. But have not been able to actually use my wallet app anywhere here in Finland. So it's going to be a fun experience just to actually buy something with my bitcoins. :)
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:58:58
What about Starbuckscoin.
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:55:44
Great article! Good luck with everything! :)
@_date: 2014-11-02 22:34:38
How much is enough?:D
@_date: 2014-04-10 00:02:21
Or drown him in starbucks.
@_date: 2014-11-06 12:22:13
Can confirm that PD are one of the only bitcoin casinos out there nowadays that are 100% legitimate. The owner Stunna is very active on the bitcoin forums and a real awesome dude when you are in contact with him!

Not really. Quoting Neil DeGrasse Tyson :"Question everything." 
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:07:36
Indeed, I think .1% would be a lot more plausible. With the upcoming tx fee decrease would be a good time to lower trading fee's too, imo.
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:00:43

What an awesome story! I have heard of a similar one from a friend of mine who uses localbitcoins here in Finland and was making a face to face trade. He went to the place they were supposed to meet up at, and the seller hadn't told him that the seller was a she. So he was totally surprised and glad that apparently more people use btc in Finland than he originally thought.
@_date: 2014-08-09 02:33:08
Alright alright, proof or get out. :D
@_date: 2014-03-05 11:56:28

Hehe, indeed. :)
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:38:24
Nowadays just a little bit at a time just to spread it around. Don't have much to tip anymore. But I used to comment a lot on other subreddits (hence my comment karma) ( [this post explains it better maybe]( )and would always tip people now and then when they had good stories. A lot of them ended up PMing me asking what it is and I directed them here. :) I figured I've given out around 2 btc in total, but most of it were before changetip. :)
Can't believe we are at 140k subscribers already, insane! :)
@_date: 2014-04-16 06:41:46
Yes, it should.
@_date: 2014-03-04 09:26:04
Downvote him to shit.
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:21:44
Yes, you are right, I noticed that after I did a smaller deposit and it worked fine! 
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:02:35
There are probably 10-20% lost already of the 12.4m.So they own a nuch bigger share. In the wrong hands this could be really bad for the future of btc.
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:14:19
My bad.

@_date: 2014-03-01 00:00:13
Probably cause he personally hasn't.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:15:02
Possibilities are endless, if in fact someone has stolen them, let's hope this person doesn't go insane and uses it for good.
With that kind of money I would become the next Batman, except that my parents are still alive. :P

Alright, thanks for the info. Can confirm it's working flawless now again. :)

This is awesome! I'm going to amsterdam this summer and can't wait to purchase something with bitcoins for the first time! :)

What happens in 2 years?
@_date: 2014-06-05 23:57:36
I didn't really see the resemblance at all.
@_date: 2014-03-01 07:38:06
Damn right.
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:32:56
he has literally give out over 150 btc to Seans and countless to random people in chat. Last thing he would do is scam you out of your coins.

How time flies!
6 years ago almost no one knew about bitcoins but look where we are now. :)
@_date: 2014-04-15 13:44:42
This isn't the 80's anymore where people could do whatever they wanted. Even then there were strict laws against that shit.
Yes, I saw The Wolf of Wall Street a couple of days ago.

Ohhh, right, cex.io prices have been going crazy too.
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:08:35
How did you receive coins if you cashed out?Just kidding.
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:14:24
I'm still worried about the 744k that may or may not be stolen and their repercussions on the economy in the wrong hands.
@_date: 2014-03-04 09:23:11
I'd say it was pretty effective the last half year.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:14:01
Yeah, will obviously read into it, it's not like I have much to buy with anyway. But the word Bitcoin Bank sounds kind of silly, wasn't the whole point of cryptos to be your own bank? :)
@_date: 2014-04-16 06:41:08

It felt even more like that when looking at the Euro price, it had just hit 1000, think daily high was 1009.

All these new Dice sites are a danger to your coins in my opinion. 
They are too easy to make and I would recommend using trusted sites if you want to gamble.

When the prices changes with 10$ my total balance moves with 1$ :P 
I can't imagine daytraders that hold thousands of bitcoins. I tried daytrading back in 2013 and never made any right choices so now I'm just holding everything. :D
@_date: 2017-02-09 20:28:36
Looks like someone didn't pay them enough to come up with mature responses to comments. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 22:38:34
Whaaa? How much is that?
@_date: 2016-01-15 14:11:31

Yeah I noticed it after I posted. Didn't bother to delete it.

The previous ATM in Helsinki was buy-only. Nice to see this pop up. I live 200kms from helsinki, should maybe take a trip and try it out once I have the fiat/btc to do so. :)

Your example made me come up with another job she could do.
@_date: 2014-11-11 16:11:48
Haha yeah, a different algo than bitcoin and 100 billion max coins. It's like the sillier version of bitcoin but people really liked them and it got a lot of hype. It's easier for kids to learn about crypto with dogecoins instead of bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:35:50
I'm pretty sure it might take a few more weeks for bitcoin to reach 60.
@_date: 2017-02-09 15:30:48




Yeah...... how about No.

@_date: 2017-01-24 16:41:32
There is a lot of hate vs different altcoins going on cross subreddits as it is, buttcoin is like the next level of that.
Try posting anything about bitcoin in the FIATers will downvote you to oblivion. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 20:47:49
Hmm, just like the bitcoin price, kinda.
@_date: 2016-06-10 22:29:55
The links to the phishing site were removed for safety, but it said bilmaintech instead of bitmaintech which is the real site. And it did so by hiding the link behind the words Antminer s9 on the blog that the paid reddit ad linked to. Phishing site looked exactly the same as real one so it didn't take a genius to figure it out.

Maybe expand those transaction fees too while they are at it.

I thought it was one of those twists where everyone expected him to say he sold it for BCC but then he just meant he made some profit on it by trading it for fiat.
@_date: 2017-01-30 10:15:23
God forbid bitcoin became any looser.

How do those people still find the energy to go on with buttcoin lol?
Its almost been around just as long as bitcoin, had they just hoarded they wouldn't have a reason to be so moody all the time.
@_date: 2017-01-24 16:29:55
Yeah, like hardforking ethereum so people could get their stolen coins back.
Sure not everyone liked it, but it was the right thing to do.
@_date: 2016-06-26 19:49:02

Isn't the retarget scheduled in ~11 hours? 
@_date: 2016-06-26 18:35:46
Does that mean they have merged to be above 51% thus now allowing the block size to increase cause their internet speed won't matter anymore?

I remember that same medium author spewing FUD not long ago.
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:06:54
They probably lost their friends and family to suicide so they had to check what this bitcoin thing is they blamed in their suicide note.

so they'll steal his coins instead
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:55:30

@_date: 2017-09-04 13:50:21
@_date: 2017-04-02 10:13:53
Maybe it's a sign that blocks won't be full in the near future. :)
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:50:01
That's kinda how I see bitcoin to altcoins nowadays.

Done. Thank you.
@_date: 2015-10-28 20:34:03
I think that as long as they refrain from using the word bit and coin and instead mention the blockchain and how chained it is to all blocks everyone who isn't that into it will be a lot more happy.
Oh and please don't mention gox, just don't, not even in a joke.

So did a part of me when I couldn't withdraw my coins.
@_date: 2015-10-17 18:22:17
I also liked that they explained this part to their buyers:
"WARNING: Coinbase, as with other bit coin vendors, will not allow for the exchange of money for bit coin without first requiring you to verify certain information, such as, bank account, credit card, or phone numbers. Upon verification, a unique block chain is assigned to your bit coin, making it uniquely your's to do with as you desire with complete anonymity."

Imagine what the people who were here 6 years ago would think reading that. :)
@_date: 2015-10-17 18:20:52
"There are certainly numerous other websites one can visit to purchase bit coin from. As you can see, it is safe and relatively easy to use bit coin to engage in financial transactions. The more you do it, the easier it becomes."
This is written at the end, and I think what he says is right, the more people will use it, the easier it will become for everyone. :)

Here is another fucked up story, here in Finland one of the biggest banks only let's you deposit money from 10:00-13:00. Not during any other time, makes it impossible for people working during those normal working hours to be able to deposit money when they need to. I'ts insane.

To be honest, he did something that I wouldn't have done if I was using the Martingale betting system. In the last bets he changed the &lt;33 to &gt;67, since the dice rolls anywhere from 0 to 100? Chances are much bigger that you should always keep it the same so that the number doesn't go under 33 once you've just changed for it to be &gt;67, which he did, a couple of times.
Edit: If I had a big amount of BTC and there was no bet limit, what I would do is this:
Basically Martingale betting system except that I add the next bet with 1 
For instance:
bet 8 BTC on &lt;33.00  LOSE  Total amount of bets: 8BTC
bet 16(+1) on &lt;33.00 LOSE  Total amount of bets: 16+1+8=25BTC
bet (17+17+1) on &lt;33.00 LOSE Total amount lost: 17+17+1+25= 60BTC
bet ^(35+35+1) on &lt;33.00 WIN= 142 BTC Total amount spent= 60+71=131BTC (won 11 BTC)
I would do this so that I wouldn't have to bet as many times and get away with the BTC I've gotten.
