What does this mean?
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:28:08
Just copy and paste, then verify it. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:49:16
so dont purchase from there at all?
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:07:22
So like if bitcoin was 11k, when I sell it would actually sell at 11.1k?
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:18:33
BTC in it's current form will never hit 20k. We need to regrease whatever is under the hood
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:20:57
I tried, but for some reason, my card isn’t supported 
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:25:13
We’ll know more when they start accepting customers 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:56:22
It’s pretty easy. Use these candles as well as volume indicators to see what’s going on. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:07:26
a lot
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:33:57
Bitcoin cash is available on GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:27:16
On GDAX, orders less than 0.01 BTC should be sent as market orders I believe. and MKT orders dont show up on the order book
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:33:40
the answer to life
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:07:36
If you have any suggestions, please let me know. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:38:20
PLEASE USE GDAX! lower fees and all. I'm also creating a mobile app for it to auto purchase on selected dates/times/market flux. I'll post more about it later. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:48:09
I just got into BTC about a week ago, and I was surprised how open GDAX Api is. you can basically create a clone lol. I plan to create an app, lockscreen widget and an Auto buy/Sell feature based on net price change. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:16:25
ahhh, i see. I was seeing alot about fees and whatnot and I didnt understand. So basically, we are stuffing more tx into a block, so we can get more tx through, and pay less fees because of it. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:25:02
Can’t you do Coinbase to USD Wallet and have GDAX pull it from there?
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:25:24
if you were hit with the insufficient funds fee, then your order will not go through. Coinbase is just waiting for the ACH response ( and should get it soon ). 
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:26:54
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:35:34
GDAX, lower fees as well
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:42:09
Hmm that's workable. I'll add this. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:06:13
whats happening Dec 9?
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:58:49
We normally graduate around 22, and around $80k, given that a semester is around 10k. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:35:14
not that much. I think the higher BTC price is, the less it will drop at each breakthrough. There's more risk
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:59:01
paxful, but they have percentages on it. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:01:51


..so I'm able to convert my direct deposit to market BTC price and get that sent to a wallet of my choosing? 
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:39:38
Computer Science
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:54:24
8999, why do you ask?
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:34:56
I would have to sign up and verify, right?
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:52:10
... but how do you cool the liquid?
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:48:31
I just downloaded it. Yes, it supports BTCAsh. No, it doesn’t finesse you. I hate Cash, but y’all looking for something to fight about lol
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:52:54
you'll be waiting..... FOREVER
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:57:24
most coins were lost years ago when BTC had no real value. Now, coins are more guarded. You cant lose coins if you're checking ticker price every 15 seconds lol
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:57:58
coinbase does do them, using their GDAX exchange
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:25:47
I don’t want to waiT for a week for BTC 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:07:11
How are they able to seize them? Especially from a private wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:56:50
I would do 30 or more. Would you rather lose $30 or all your BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:21:58
but in 10 years she could be paid millions. Thats a tradeoff I would accept. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:51:35
there is always a correction at every new psychological barrier. It will dip, yes, but not by much. I would say ~&lt;400 dip, but that's just me. 
The price is also very manipulated. Could crash a bit higher.
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:37:03
i see what you did there
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:41:04
Lol, why not dip the cold coil into the liquid?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:28:32
A huge plummet. I would say even to 6k
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:14:18
My canceled my limit order but it still holding my funds. I am behond pissed
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:42:35
i giggled
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:59:18
limit order, or you can do a stop market buy order. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:37:45
you can buy on paxful with Paypal and Squarecash. Quick and easy!
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:42:32
orrrrr they could just put the coil in the liquid. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:41:23
My dream car. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:24:23
the address you sent it to is your own "personal" address. The second that it sent it to is Coinbase's own holding address, either cold storage or a buffer of coins they keep at ready. You have to remember, you dont own any bitcoins with coinbase. CB is basically giving you an IOU until the point where you want to transfer them out or sell them. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:58:41
how many confirmations does it have?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:30:13
If you can transfer it to another address with a MUCH HIGHER transfer fee. As much as you can afford. This “doublespend” will allow your transaction to be mined quicker and negate the previous one. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:27:13
It’ll bounce back even if it plummets. Do it. The correction has already occurred 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:24:23
lol this may be a physics thing that current out of my grasp to understand. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:35:14
Hmmm, I see. Let me check it out  
Gemini is great, but the $ is on a debit card. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:57:56
stay safe and strap on. 8k when i wake up :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:56:09
I️ don’t think we’ll hit 7k til next week. We’ve been pushing close to it, but those sell walls aren’t budging 
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:54:15
I️ have some low level machine learning code based on order book size ratios that’s been decent. Good enough?
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:23:10
so the liquid is already cold. The air is what's actually warm. I get it now
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:33:54
you need to shush. and delete this post. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:40:44
same happened to me. I submitted a ticket and it cleared up in about an hour. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:31:51
it always dips during the weekend. might not be alot of a dip.
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:11:13
Coinbase isn’t an actual wallet. That’s why. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:40:38
keep it in the exchange. Once the split occurs, either sell your B2X or send it to your wallet. you can move your coins off as well. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:08:26
Actually, I️ feel like it’ll hover around 69xx for another day. Once it touches 7k tho, it will dip, like 65xx, I️ think. Once that dip happens several times , 7k won’t be a barrier and we’re off to 8.
Pls, I’m not a trader.
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:13:43
If you have a card on file, you can set it up to be automatic. If you don’t, it’ll email you a few days before.
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:22:18
Bitcoin isn’t anonymous, but I do understand what you mean. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 02:23:01
I haven’t had any problems. Not to sound like a service promoter, but they have 5.95/Mo VPS. Runs my bots just fine 
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:49:22
I actually have a backup in a ceiling tile at my college. I move it around every few weeks. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:00:19
everything follows BTC price
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:10:56
I have, and doesn’t it still involve running though hoops scanning and whatnot? I want it as easy as typing in a personalized tag like $programmrz and press send. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:35:02
And I wish I got the lotto numbers right last month.
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:04:47
I’m not promoting the service, I’m promoting the streamlined approach of sending money without having to see a convoluted address.

I believe the tip bot was to incite interest. I believe that is no longer the case
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:24:37
Peer to Peer, like Paxful.com could help. Localbitcoins as well, but depending on the amount, your bank may want to know where the $ is coming from 
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:18:50
I actually might....
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:17:49
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:45:46
How does mining work then? I thought pools pick the txs with the highest fees. There isn’t a way to make my own pool that looks for specific addresses and transactions?
@_date: 2018-02-19 09:59:18
lmao EVERYONE has problems with coinbase support. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:17:02
im not understanding you...
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:52:17
This is very confusing. This is a new reason I don’t support S2X
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:21:23
I bought around 12k in crypto on coinbase, and was aggressively trading. I made around 10k in profit and sent alot to some external addresses (Nano S and to brothers addy). I recieved my 1099k and it had 140k in the main 1a? box. What does this mean. Will I need to pay more in taxes than my profit? I have a log of my trades, how do I go about giving the IRS this?
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:46:16
So if I create a pool and have mining systems, I’d be able to control which blocks I mine?
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:02:54
I know, but I’m more concerned about the building an exchange where you own your coins, and have a backend that covers the transactions that are being trading 
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:36:16
I’m guessing the reason you can’t sign in or reset your password is bc your email and security info have been changed.
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:18:27
That’s the inherent problem.  Jumping through these ‘setup’ hoops just to make things work.
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:41:17
2 + 2 = 4 minus 1 is 3 quick maths
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:26:19
I would buy coins on Coinbase or Bitstamp, and then trade on Binance.
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:36:15
mining reward per block will be halved. I'm assuming BTC value should rise bc of that. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:01:25
all hes doing is selling. how is that a crime
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:20:42
I may work on something of that nature
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:40:14
So I have a wallet, but I’ve never used it. I just send my BTC to my wallet, and I should have both versions when it does split?
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:36:43
Can you expand on your answer?
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:18:11

Lite coin 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:15:41
I’m scared of paxful. They also take .60 on the dollar, so it’s not cost effective 
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:04:53
So a peer to peer exchange isn’t really cost effective to say the least 
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:19:14
You know what, I actually might 
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:41:01
You’ve been hacked bro

@_date: 2017-10-26 00:16:39

@_date: 2018-04-01 16:25:03
what I do is just transfer all my funds out of my bank account, and eat that overdraft charge. That’s only in extreme drops though. 
How did I get banned for this?
