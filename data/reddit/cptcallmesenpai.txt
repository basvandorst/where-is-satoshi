Sold my coin off after buying 0.00405 back at 63,000 ZAR. spent some tim learning about the coin and trading on exchanges . BTC dropped to 0.00135 so I lost a lot and this recent drop allowed me to correct my balance and recover that which I learned with . It was like the ultimate BTC Xmas Present

Hi there, Still a Newb myself . 
 ~ Ledger manufactures their own wallets using a trustworthy and partnered French company . 
 ~ on Ledger's [website]( they state that all new orders will start shipping on November 13th if not mistaken .
 ~ Amazon could have stock piled a bunch but we cannot deduce for sure as they are not listed as an official retailer on the Ledger site.
To be safe Id recommend placing your order directly through Ledger's website to avoid any confusion , tampering with the Device and trust loss as they are the original and Authorized retailers.
 ~ Down side is the wait time (2FA should side you over with security concerns until the 13th of Nov)
 ~ Upside - they are the Official retailers and trust is kept 100%
Just my 0.00000002 Satoshi's worth !

Check Zimbabwe out - they mass adopted it quickly last year.
South Africans where the voices behind Luno adding Ethereum - despite Luno being in South East Asia and Europe.
Edit : Bitpesa is a similar thing to Mpesa - most successful of the Phone Money gigs.

Fuck the Rand - I earn it and my buying power isnt stable in general. The political side of it could have been avoided if we just stopped the segregation in the 60's like everyone else.

I get my news from News.Bitcoin.com 
You could search the site for Africa related articles for a "best fit" solution.
I myself am also looking for reliable and trustworthy BTC Africa news portal type thing.

They tend to post the same articles as most over news platforms and I enjoy the styles of the writers they employ. Fox News is big for a reason so far as I remember.
