That would be nice and make a lot of sense.

I would argue against that as I am probably one of many investors simply listening to my friend who is up $300k off a $3600 investment who said "get in" so I bought as many BTC's as I could. He said they will be $10k by the end of the year, possibly by the end of oct. He showed me his gains, why would I not listen. However, I am doing as much digging as I can. Now I'm very concerned because he doesn't even know about this fork, S2x or any of it. I just recently got a hardware wallet and was advised to take all my coin off coinbase and put it there because coinbase may give me the coin that ends up being "worthless" in comparison to what I spent, which was approx $4300 per BTC. I don't know how many people I know who have bought BTC just because someone told them too. Buy and hold and not even caring about whats happening. It's a lot my friend. I'm just starting to understand exactly what BTC is and does to best know what I should do. As long as people keep changing shit, splitting coins into multiple currencies, the real world, the world of 7-11's, Walmarts, ma and pap retailers, will never recognize BTC as a valid currency because they see the BTC community is a bunch of jackasses looking to get rich quick. More concerned about technology rather than practicality. Less than 0.5% of people that you have ever come in contact with would take bitcoin as a payment in place of cash. If people want that to change, they need to stop talking about "blockchain" bullshit and start thinking about how the US dollar is so valuable. After all...people are only investing in BTC to get more USD!! USD is simply based on one thing. Confidence. Right now, the only thing the average investor is confident in, is a friend who told them they would make a shit ton more USD. Lol...ironic how people are only into BTC for USD. They could give a fuck about bitcoin. Myself included. 
Now, if I'm wrong anywhere, feel free to blow my doors off. I'm not here to protect my feelings, but rather make the right investment choice.

Thanks for the wallet tips. 
I get what you mean. That kind of blows because I would never know which one is going to succeed or not! Yikes.

Trying to wrap my head around this being a very new investor (not trader). I own only a few bitcoins but I bought them around where they are right now, so a few btc is still a decent amount of cash for the non billionaire.
It's currently in coinbase, and I will be moving it to a hardware wallet. What do I need to do, in order to benefit from this "skyrocket" you are talking about? Just hold and do nothing?

Did it? :(

Gotcha. I just got my hardware wallet in the mail yesterday. I will set it up very soon. I figured that was the best option. Gosh I really hope everyone is right and it does go way up after a possible dip. Forgive me too for any arrogance I displayed. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 04:55:52
I am holding it. i also bought other coins. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:43:22
All in the hopefully very near future!

Ok. and by "splitting the coin" does that mean separate currencies? why would anyone want dozens of the same version of bitcoin roaming around? I personally think the more they complicate it, the less an average small business owner, and mid sized business owner will recognize it as a real currency. The question won't be do you accept bitcon, rather, which bitcoin do you accept? Version 1 through 99? Maybe i'm just new but I don't understand why by making something better, why someone would want to keep the old version. There's so much focus on the tech side, rather than the practicality side. After all...the only reason the USD is valued so much, is only because of confidence. And right now i'm concerned about my USD getting destroyed by these people because my coin will be split into some worthless version of bitcoin lol. If I'm wrong anywhere please don't hesitate to light me up, but I will be taking your advice and getting a hardware wallet.

I'm a new user on coinbase. Should they not clarify what they plan to do shortly, should I / we, move our coin off of coinbase to an offline wallet such as electrum or hardware wallet? I would hate to have some in there and something happens where I lose some bitcoin or worse get stuck with bitcoin I do not want or something after the fork.
