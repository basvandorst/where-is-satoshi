Because it’s always smart to diversify. Bitcoin is the top one but others are great to hold as well. It’s like having a mutual fund.

I honestly can’t give you advice on where you should hold your coins. That is something you’ll have to decide on your own. Your own wallets are usually the safest way to hold unless you’re day trading and need the coins on a exchange.

Would this explain why they received no additional help in the end? Unconfirmed transactions

So basically bitcoin is not in a bubble because it will continue to grow in value regardless of media FUD?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:14:24
Actually, they’re hiring more people as we speak but the growth of users has been faster than they (or anyone else) can manage. Right now is a crazy time for the crypto space and I’m sorry you’re going through this. Try and hang in there and keep us updated.

Binance is instant 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:44:26
I agree. This is why I’m not “all in” at current prices because I leave USD available to buy the major discounted dips. You never know when you can grab .5 or 1 bitcoin for half of the current price 
Edit: I still hold long with BTC just not “all in”.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:45:06
If you’re looking for organic growth then you might want to research BNB. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:25:33
When in doubt just HODL.

@_date: 2017-12-16 18:25:54
Owning bitcoin in any amount is great. Be a part of the revolution that you’ll never forget. Only purchase a small amount that you can afford and hold on to it for as long as you can while witnessing history.

It’s legit, I was one of the original angels and can tell you the Binance team is one of the best
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:49:48
This dude clearly missed the 1,000 different times he could’ve jumped into bitcoin , ETH, and LTC.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:10:19
Don’t time the market. Just hold dude, it’s not going to burst in 5 days.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:48:35
I’m long. Getting you back from your reply to my original post, asshole. Lol

Only 21 million can ever be mined

Thats temporary. Once BTC ATH settles down then it flows back into the altcoins creating a new ATH for the legit altcoins (ETH etc). The ones that are pump and dumps will get smoked and won’t catch up. However, BTC won’t be the lone wolf in the market and nor should you want it to be the only one to thrive.

The younger you are the higher risk you can take due to having a longer time to recover prior to retirement if things go wrong. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:37:57
NOW we are in a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:52:48
Not nervous because every crash is healthy and always responds with a new ATH 
Take crashes as a buying opportunity to increase your BTC holdings while on discount 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:56:20
A great question and very valid concern. I’ll be following this.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:16:57
I was having this discussion the other day. I highly doubt it was talked about like the way they attack bitcoin. This makes me feel like the media always wants to control the masses (and they do) and it isn’t working. Another reason why bitcoin is becoming so successful because it can’t be controlled. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:11:09
The first time I thought like you I lost $20k from selling during a “crash”. It took me 6 months to recover but now I’m a little bit more seasoned and have since made my profits 100 fold, literally.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:16:33
They’ll learn real quick what HODL means

Welcome to the world of crypto currency 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:08:47
Smart vendors started accepting bitcoin while it’s unstable to they could make MORE money off the increased value. Look at overstock.com , no one is laughing at them now.

You don’t want to sell BTC when it crashes, you’ll want to HODL. But I get your concern. You will have to wait for your credit card limit to increase to $5k plus for instant buys or wait for a USD transfer to hit GDAX/Coinbase. Personally, I would just buy and HODL. But hey, what do I know?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:43:48
Try Kraken?
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:15:24
When they add lightning network then you’ll know...
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:15:23
Kraken allows a higher deposit for higher tiers. Coinbase will allow higher withdrawals but you have to get it approved by contacting them.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:37:52
I can’t believe you forgot LAMBO
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:09:25
Current fair value should actually be at $29-30k.

@_date: 2017-12-13 00:09:54
What’s considered a “big crash” to you? Are you new to crypto? It could “crash” to $3k and I’d view it as normal and a buying opportunity. In fact, in crypto terms, that would just be the typical dip from scared news etc and then you’d see a new ATH the week after.
