I unsubscribed from this subreddit due to large amount of posts like this, Seeing pages of 'Hold spartans' memes before made me feel like I was part of some MLM scheme dreamt up on hackforums or 4chan. Everything is just  about price price price is it 'to the moon' or is it 'crashing', reminiscent of btc-e troll box... really cringey material to have to sift through to find the developments in Bitcoin ecosystem, But to be fair- If i was 14-16 again I am sure I'd behave in the same way.
