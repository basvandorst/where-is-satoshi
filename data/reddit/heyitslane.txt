It’s hard to believe that the people who post these things don’t realize how painfully cringe-worthy they are
@_date: 2018-09-16 02:53:57
Super cringe

You’re right, that does sound cheesy

Why would you ever need to pay someone bitcoin to order you a Pizza Hut pizza? Next time message me, I’ll do it for cheaper...$19.95 and I’ll call whatever pizza place you want bud
@_date: 2019-01-04 16:43:46
Exactly. It’s laughable. Die-hard fanboys seriously get their rocks off to ridiculous stats like this haha
@_date: 2019-01-04 18:06:06
I don’t know how to explain it any more clearly. I bow out
@_date: 2019-01-01 23:21:34
Exactly my point...because in the meantime it’s worthless.
@_date: 2019-01-04 19:05:57
Is that supposed to affect the cringeyness of this in any way, dude?
@_date: 2019-01-02 00:45:48
Are you honestly trying to tell me that you would rather have crypto than gold? I’m not here to debate the value of gold or trying to prove to you about gold as a currency...that’s well established.
@_date: 2019-01-01 22:09:39
You wouldn’t even be here to post that statement if you didn’t have a family haha, how ironic. We should just cease to exist, that’ll show ‘em ;)
@_date: 2019-01-01 23:19:26
Hahaha. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 17:55:29
I don’t think you’re getting what hindsight means. You don’t get to say “I told you so” in 2016 when he made the comment. Bashing it in 2016 isn’t hindsight or saying “told ya so”...however, bashing it in 2018 is. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:38:22
Sure, the idea is revolutionary. Buying crypto and acting like you’re smarter than others for not buying in is dumb. This tweet is a ridiculous correlation that makes zero sense. It’s like me saying “Walmart brings in 74 billion a year, while BTC is worth 67 billion. Think about that”. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 23:22:56
Are you having a stroke?
@_date: 2019-01-04 15:30:03
These are so cringey it hurts. Reaching soo hard

“You never had debit or credit cards to do that?” 
That’s exactly the point I’m making. My question stands: when was the last time you made a major purchase with crypto? Calling it “hard” inflatable wealth is a reallll stretch. Honestly, I truly hope it works out for everyone and you all become billionaires...but until crypto is accepted for necessities for life instead of a fellow kool-aid drinker, then it’s fictional. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 20:11:14
Because I, too, once believed in fairy tales. I still own a substantial amount (relative to my income), but it means nothing. There is nothing to do but hold until enough suckers buy in to create a spike to let me dump it on the next poor, unsuspecting victim. Until you can use crypto to purchase necessities for life, then it is nothing but virtual bullshit. Please don’t even try to tell me you can use your crypto to buy actual things of value either, I’ve been around long enough. Won’t happen in our lifetimes
@_date: 2019-01-02 00:12:22
Thank you! Now that is impressive. Hopefully one day you can buy shelter, food, or another basic need with it.

Just stop. Warren buys things that make money safely, and he has no reason to take massive risks with people’s money. There’s a reason the entire world knows his name: he’s the best at what he does. Third richest person in the world in 2018. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 22:01:19
A lot of stipulations and what-ifs. Also, coming from someone who has traveled to multiple countries....a lot of the locals LOVE getting the USD instead of local currency, so that doesn’t always hold water. True transactions and store of wealth are independent...but when one can’t really be considered for either of those, then there is a problem. Considering hoarding crypto as a storage of wealth is like me saying I’m going to start collecting toilet paper rolls at my house, because I believe at some point in the future they will be worth something to someone and/or be widely accepted. Hell, literally anything could be a currency as long as you make people believe it’s worth something. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 08:19:17
You just talked a big circle to come back to the fact that yes, your preference is crypto. That means nothing to me, except that you’re one of the many of us that was sold a idea of made-up money. I hope we all cash out.
@_date: 2019-01-05 23:05:29
Grown men are talking. No “norf” bay boys allowed

I’ll give you a list:
1. Gold is a tangible object.
2. It is considered a precious metal, which existed on Earth long before humans and will continue to exist long after.
3. Gold has been used as currency since currency existed.
4. It does have industrial uses, as well as many, many more.
5. All money was originally backed by gold.
This list could go on and on but you get the point.

Please do me a huge favor: save my username and this conversation, and each year over the next decade we can come back here for me to say “I told you so”.
@_date: 2019-01-01 20:25:11
Ohh, you’re one of those...that checks out. A lot more than 2 bucks, a lot less than others dumped into fairyland internet money. Like I said, relative to my income...not here to tell you how much or attempt to show off my wallet. That was all you could refute out of my comment haha. What was the last major purchase you bought with crypto?
@_date: 2019-01-05 22:28:56
Did you just say HR ladies?
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:18:12
So cringey it hurts** I’ll lighten up when people quit acting like they’re changing the world by buying computer money
@_date: 2019-01-01 21:17:53
.....that’s the point. You lost real actual currency, because you used it to purchase currency that is make believe. We’ve all drank the kool-aid, I just know when to admit that I was wrong and put my faith in mystical computer money. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 18:23:35
I refer you to my previous comment
@_date: 2019-01-04 05:53:26
What’s so hilarious is that people are acting like Warren Buffett doesn’t know what he’s doing. Guy is a pro and has made more investing than all of our wildest dreams put together. He doesn’t lose a wink of sleep about BTC lol
@_date: 2019-01-02 01:51:39
No ATH buyers over here. Had a wallet since 2010, before you even knew what this fake ass money was...doesn’t change a thing ;)
@_date: 2019-01-01 20:52:42
.....do I need to explain the irony in this? 
@_date: 2019-01-01 22:27:55
See, everything you just listed to me are nothing but good qualities of Bitcoin. Although they are nice, not a single one of those things are a requirement of actual currency. None of that is to say that toilet paper couldn’t be currency in the future. It is only a question of belief, since the beginning of time. All of these responses and not one single person has been able to give me ONE example of a major purchase with Bitcoin, besides telling me they have “wealth” based on a hope and a prayer.
@_date: 2019-01-01 18:35:55
When are we just going to admit that cryptocurrencies are just make-believe internet money that is actually worth virtually nothing. It was fun, though. Happy New Year and bring on the downvotes 
@_date: 2019-01-02 05:32:23
For all of our sakes, I hope you’re right. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 17:29:41
Such wow, much edgy, ahead of the curve
