While an SSD is faster than a hard drive, RAM is even faster than an SSD. If I remember correctly, RAM is still at least an order of magnitude faster than an SSD

I can't speak for the bitcoin devs, but this won't work in the long term. The blockchain is getting bigger and bigger, and in a bit it won't fit into your memory. I bet it's also not a pressing concern for them, because you only download the initial chain once, and they have a few other ideas for speeding that up.
After thinking about it a little more I apologize for bringing up the difference between your SSD's read and write latencies because that doesn't matter here. Whether you do everything in ram before pushing it to the drive or push it piece by piece, you end up with a lot of data getting written to the disk.
What does makes a big difference is that verifying a block from the chain requires looking at earlier blocks. For every input of every transaction in a block you have to find and read it's matching output from some previous transaction, which could be anywhere in the blockchain. That random searching and reading is something ram is very good at (it is, after all, random access memory). Solid states are decent at it but there's still a large performance difference.
I wouldn't expect memory mapping to help very much. I bet transactions are roughly scattered around randomly so you'll touch a bunch of separate memory pages and never really reuse them, which is the same thing they're already doing.

That's a great point. I just checked bitcoinforums and it looks like RAM is still your best bet. Supposedly if you throw everything onto your ram it'll take around an hour or two to sync the entire blockchain. Using an SSD, it could take 10 hours or more.
I'll throw out there that unless you bought a very expensive SSD your read performance is probably much higher than your write performance. They still write faster than hard disks, but not by as much as you would expect.

Never. This looks very much so like a place which will take all your coins and run. The website is too professional, uses all the right words, and promises interest. However it does have a plus, it does a very good job of making simplistic statements about Bitcoins without getting anything wrong.

You try to prove the titanic with Math. Thought so. :P

There has to be a better solution than giving your private key to somebody else.
