they had a psycho stalking them from a competing site, which got shut down by the fbi. same nutter was going after lbc too lol.
these guys do alot of good. figures they were banned,

I have a bitwallet and paxful account now anyways. getting plenty of trades without them.
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:25:29
I was SELLING coins there. so how could I scam anyone?
They said i was connected to a scammer.. a guy I sold coins too...
100% of the scams on lbc happen to sellers like me!
Their whole answer is bogus!! they refuse to give me my coins, I shouldn;t have to upload ID if i just want my coins back and to have my account canceled! seriously.. these guys are shady as helll!
@_date: 2015-06-23 05:24:31
yup. really like this site. i been using it for a while now. pref over circle and coinbase. hear the dudes r swell.
@_date: 2015-06-23 05:45:03
and who are you anyway? another sock puppet like the ones that voted down my thread before? seriously. why not just deal with people honestly. take a dudes money and downvote his threads. what the hell is this?
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:37:39
these guys are holding onto my coins too. refuse to give them up and it's just 1.3 btc!! and i was selling them there. why would they hold onto such a small amount if they are making so much. makes me think they're doing fract res and holding onto as many coins as they can after numerous hacks.
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:42:14
They are makin' over a quarter million bucks every month and they are holding onto my 1.3 coins refusing to give them to me for some utterly bogus reason???
When will my coins be released. I was only selling coins there and had a good reputation. Why is localbitcoins locking customer funds? That's Paypal's job!
@_date: 2015-06-05 14:41:06
My username is schlomoc
Ban me if you want but please release my coins. Thanks
@_date: 2015-06-07 17:58:09
cancel my account and give me back my coins.
I was selling them and scammed no one.
you have no right to hold my coins!
your excuse is bs. associating me with a known scammer? someone i sold coins to 2 months ago?? who has a 100% rep. why am I being punished? you want me to take some time and make a big deal out of this?
just give me back my coins and stop holding them hostage.
@_date: 2015-06-02 00:05:20
i like LBC, but seriously their excuse is total bs. they have some ultra shady folks there and they never hold their coins. whole thing stinks and their excuse stinks. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 18:01:22
and you just pmed me and gave me the same bs support gave me. 
"we're holding your coins hostage for no damn reason" 
release my coins and cancel my account. thanks
@_date: 2015-06-03 17:46:05
Is it LBC policy to hold onto a traders bitcoin and refuse to give it back, even if they are selling?
You are hilding onto my coins for days now claiming i was associated with a scammer even tho i sold him coins and he has 100% feedback. What gives?
Please cancel my account a d give me back my coins. Even coinbase doesnt hold onto coins.
A few btc may be nothing to you but it is alot to little guys like me. Thanks
@_date: 2015-06-06 13:20:16
Same bs no logic excuse. They said i was linked to a known scammer, i kept asking till i got his username. He has 100% feedback and i sold him coins 2 months ago once. Why would they do this? MKes zero sense almost seems like they are punishing me for some reason. Only thing i can recall is that i shared my otherselling profiles on another otc site on there. Seems like they wanna hold onto their 300 coins a week. Best of luck to me but give me back my 1.3 btc! Punishing little guys is not what bitcoin is about. Cancel my account and give me back my btc!!!
@_date: 2015-06-06 03:41:10
yup circle will close your account. they accused me of selling otc and they were right. at least they gave me back my coins. localbitcoins is holding my coins demanding ID for selling my coins there.
@_date: 2015-06-07 18:02:56
I think they're the shady characters if they are just holding my coins for no reason, coins i brought into their system to sell only.
makes no sense!
@_date: 2015-06-23 15:54:26
give me back my coins or i'll keep going.
tried being nice and it got me the same bs.
seriously you need to just give me my coins back. it is just 1.3 btc to you but alot to a little guy like me!
what exactly are you all punishing me for anyway??!?!?!?
@_date: 2015-06-05 15:07:26
@_date: 2015-06-07 18:02:18
I don't wanna be there anymore, there are other sites now. Don't need to be on that scammer heaven. why don;t they just release my coins and ban my account. very simple. no reason whatsoever to hold my coins.
@_date: 2015-06-23 05:14:51
when they give me back my hard earned money. i'll be glad to do something better with my time!
@_date: 2015-06-07 18:00:19
they said I was linked to a "known scammer" some dude i SOLD coins 2 two months ago who has a 100% rep. lol
there is no reason to hold my coins hostage that I brought in from the outside and only sold there. They just want to dox me or something. Seems like it's personal makes zero sense. 
Don't keep your coins in localbitcoins, apparently security isn't the only issue...
@_date: 2015-08-24 04:19:06
lol, yup
we bring it upon ourselves...
@_date: 2015-08-24 04:21:02
why did they delete it?
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:17:06
Best damn note books ever!
@_date: 2015-10-03 17:56:16
not sure it is easiest but it can be very fast and u can make a lil profit. 
My friend from Edmonton did this before. He bought bitcoins off a CAD exchange, Cavirx or something.
Then ee used his localbitcoins and paxful account to put up an ad for selling his bitcoin for USD to his US bank account.
He usually gets bites in an hour or less and makes about 15%-20% profit. not a bad way to move and convert money.
