They have pool support for BCC though, which is the only reason why I ever bothered with the site in the first place

The main thing that determines how soon a transaction is confirmed is the transaction fee. You could be sending 0.00000001 BTC and somebody else could be sending 1,000,000 BTC, but if you attached a higher transaction fee (than the other person) to the amount sent, your transaction will be confirmed before theirs. I own a Trezor, and have also purchased BTC at coinbase. I've never had this problem before, and I hope that it gets resolved for you!

I'm just curious; what exactly made you purchase a the Ledger Nano rather than Trezor?

Thank you, sorry.....

Just buy a Trezor, and your Bitcoin will be safer than the gold reserves in Fort Knox!

If lock her in a deep freezer for a 24 hours, I GUARANTEE you that she will be even cooler than before you guys started dating. Take my word for it, this ain't my first rodeo.

Nothing, that's just why we'll just use forums on .onion sites instead
