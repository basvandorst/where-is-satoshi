This is the best analogy I have seen about non believers. Props.

So do you think it would be worth it? Assuming BFL does come through with the ASICs?

Thank you for the advice. It was really helpful.

I made the transaction twice. One for me and one for a friend as a gift. The first one went through almost instantly but the second one took a fair amount of time.

I bought some coins when it was at 100$ just so I could get a part for a computer that needs help but the transaction took about a week and now I'm out over 25% of what I should have and I also don't have enough btc to buy the part anymore because the price raised.

Two weeks ago it was at $70, then a few days ago it jumped to $100, and now down to $85, that seems pretty wide to me.

What would be the best place to sell them? All I can think of is eBay but PayPal is notorious for charge backs on things like this.

I did send them an email and now they have to deal with bitpay to confirm the transaction.

I think what OP meant by a 24 hour wait is that the program that decodes you wallet waits 24 hours and then sends the coins.

It does continue to generate the new addresses and it will keep up to the last 100. The reason for ops concern is that if you go past 100 transactions and don't have a backup then the account is unrecoverable if lost or corrupted.
For an example let's say I have an account with 10 BTC and I make a back up of it after I send coins twice. A few moths later I have a total of 105 transactions sent and no backups since the first one at 2 sends 105 - 2 = 103. 103 is more than the 100 kept addresses so if I try to restore my wallet from a corruption all of those accounts in the the backup are at 0 BTC so I have lost the remaining coins.
Op feared that he has passed that 100 transaction limit.
Note about the 100 transaction cap is that you need to SEND coins for a new address to be created. Receiving does nothing to your private key and is only credited when scanned with the block chain.

That would be great! I have had troubles getting this miner working on Linux. I couldn't get the USB drives to read when I was working with Ubuntu on a different rig.

There customer service is good and after they verify with bitpay you will get your coins back.

I have read that it works great with the Block Erupter but the BFL Jalapeño is much more difficult to get started. The USB drives for it are broken and need to be manually installed. And then you need to have the mining program read the device. So far its been a pain in the ass as there is little documentation for it.

I tried calling there support number and got nowhere and I couldn't find an email other than their store from my last purchase.

This is a good concept but this is what cold storage wallets are for. Make an offline wallet on a bootable flash that resets after a reboot. Only send coins to that wallet don't send from it until you want to spend it, then make a new one. Make the password really strong 20+ characters with special characters. And then back it up everywhere.

Did you get a confirmation email when they shipped or did they just come in the mail one day?
