Poor billionaire, if he invested in Bitcoin he would be so much better off!

Can someone explain why many Bitcoin holders are so against bch? Is there a history that I'm missing here?

I understand, that's just very vague but to a certain extent I agree. I don't see crypto or blockchain technology going anywhere. I just think people need to temper their expectations in the near future especially with concerns to it as a currency. I see people thinking it will be the world's biggest currency in the short term which is insane in my opinion. Or is filled with trolls and  Otherwise, I agree with the tech being around for the long haul. 
Also, if it is like the internet, there is going to be a lot of money lost before it finds its footing.

I mean I don't see it going anywhere as in "it isn't going away".

As long as it doesn't end up like [this]( I'm happy

That seems like a stretch. In the context of purchasing and spending fiat is faster and more powerful for most people to use. It is also easier. I don't think bitcoin will ever get there though I do see it being used to store wealth.
I could see a crash of a lot of cryptocurrencies in the near future but I believe bitcoin is around for the long haul. The way money is being thrown at altcoin companies and altcoins themselves and the way people talk around here and in some other articles I've seen (bitcoin will be 50000 by years end!) sounds a lot like the internet bubble that burst around 2000. I'm afraid that there was so much hype around altcoins and the money you could make recently due to mining of new coins that speculation drove prices out of control and when a lot of these people who were only in it to make money realize they can't quickly do that, they will pull it out for fiat causing it to dip quite a lot.
I grew up in the 90s and I don't remember people dismissing the internet, by that time even the average person could see the massive benefit it would provide and were ready to accept it with open arms. Crypto is getting popular, but I think people overestimate how many people out there actually want to invest in it and use it today.

So does this mean they are anti alt coin in general? Or does forking Bitcoin piss them off more? I'm trying to figure out why everyone has their panties in a twist when they are likely in favor of market freedom.

I keep seeing people say this but what was the fiat equivalent to the internet at the time?
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:18:59
Ok fair enough I wasn't aware. As far as value goes though, you could say no coins have any value without people believing they have value yes?

Define large? Yes, it is very easy to send bitcoin long distances but I meant purely from a consumer spending standpoint.
I do agree with the troubles of moving large amounts of fiat but that also comes with protections that bitcoin does not currently have. Of course that is sort of the point to not use an arbitrary middle man.

You think more people will invest when they have less money for their day to day lives?
