I think Segwit does more than just fix malleability.  It’s necessary for LN although I don’t know why. 
“When Segwit transactions are sent to Legacy nodes the witness data is stripped. The key is that these “stripped” transactions are still valid transactions on Legacy nodes, which gives us a savings over non-Segwit transactions. Thus, more transactions can fit into the block sent to Legacy nodes without going over the 1,000,000 byte limit.”

Ok so Core still says the coins were sent to Coinomi and shows a zero balance ?  
And the block explorer is also showing the TX ID as unconfirmed? 
If yes, your transaction is stuck as the fee is too low.  It must be an incredibly low fee if still stuck.  
You can either wait because the mem pool is currently clearing and should be empty soon.  Or you can use this:

Agreed free electricity results in a lower cost to coin.  But the Chinese miners aren’t getting free electricity anymore.  They are now having to compete on much closer to a level playing field. 
ASIC Boost gives you 15% more space on the chip and a 30% electricity advantage.   That’s a 15% savings in wafer cost and 30% savings in electricity.  
With Segwit 1X we have a chance of competition  coming back.  Segwit 2X would re-enable ASIC Boost.  This is why the war has been so intense, because the Chinese monopoly is now fragile.

That’s exactly the point.  The West honors patents and China does not.  ASIC boost is great if it is made available to everyone. The fact that no one but the Chinese can use it means they have a competitive advantage, protected by IP law. 
Bullshit on mining manufacturing being centralized in China before ASIC boost. KNC, Butterfly and others were making ASICS.

Agreed but the key metric is profitability.   There is a break over point where the Bcash price is so low it is no longer profitable to mine it at 6 blocks per hour with any meaningful hash power.  
So far as I can tell, Bcash has 14.5% hash power and slowly falling in cycles per the DAA.  
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:32:17
How do you think the DAA will work?   I can see that it will keep the Bcash chain alive by progressively lowering difficulty as hash power falls but I don’t understand how profitability can be maintained at 10 blocks per hour.  
Or is it only because Bitcoin is currently averaging 4 blocks per hour or so until the difficulty comes down ?  
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:07:55
This is true.  In a price plunge, you know it is reaching bottom when the price starts going vertical straight down the screen.  The problem is it’s falling hundreds of dollars a second and you don’t know where to try to catch it.

8mb blocks will be full very quickly.   In fact the miners have already demonstrated they can fill them with spam.

The mem pool was only full because of the Bcash money printing spree.  We both know that.  
It is more important to preserve decentralization (small blockchain) than it is to have 0 - 5 sat few transactions.   150 sat transactions are currently getting through despite Bcash pulling about 40% of the hash rate right now.  
Bcash is a freight train towards centralisation.  You can ride that train.  But it’s not my choice.  And Wall St is not going to ride your train either.

The 1 MB block size cap is a limit to prevent blockchain bloat at what is a very early stage.  Apparently you don’t want to control your private keys.  Others do.   
I have checked your other posts and it is very clear you understand the issues and are only talking your own book. 
The mem pool is now clearing because Bcash is not producing 40 blocks an hour.  Do you think 40 blocks an hour is a good way to run a block chain?   
Do you realize that since it’s start Bcash has produced twice as many coins as Bitcoin?  That’s just not sustainable in the long run.

China centralisation was due to ASIC boost which they patented to prevent anyone else from competing with them.  
KNC Miners said they went broke because China had some hidden advantage.  That hidden advantage was ASIC boost.  The patent only became public later.  
Segwit 1X breaks ASIC boost which threatens China centralisation because the Chinese can’t rely on their patent to prevent Western mining companies from competing with them.  That’s why Bcash removed it.   Your support for Bcash is support for China centralisation.  By trying to get Bcash to flip Bitcoin, you are trying to ensure that Western companies cannot compete in the mining space because of the ASIC boost patent.

It’s not a supermajority because the so-called longer proof is invalid.  Any invalid proof of work is simply rejected.   
You might be technically correct that B2X might have more hashing power.  But Bcash had more hashing power as well during EDC events.  That doesn’t make it valid.  
For all I know, Ethereum has more hashing power than bitcoin.  Still doesn’t make it valid.

Bitcoin Core does not use a 12 word passcode so you cannot use that method

1.  We can agree to disagree on the word supramajority.  You think it applies across both valid and invalid chains - I think it only applies to valid chains

What you are referring to is a 51% attack.  
It has always been the case that a hostile group of miners could *with sufficient hash power* overwrite the Bitcoin blockchain from the genesis block to give Satoshi’s coins to Jihan or whoever.   A lesser amount of hash power is required to disrupt the chain on a going forward basis - you only need more hashing power than the honest miners.  
It has never happened so far because a majority of miners don’t want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.   
A hostile fork doesn’t really change anything - ultimately miners will follow the money.  And the money goes with the users.  What the miners have completely failed to do is persuade the users that their fork has merit.  
The reality is that the Bitcoin blockchain has been constantly under attack almost since inception and this particular attack is nothing new.

By definition a chain with different rules is a different chain.  B2X has different rules therefore it is as different from Bitcoin as Bcash. 
The problem all the B2X shills have is that the consensus rules refer to the longest valid chain.   I can make a fork with a 10,000 block premine tomorrow.   That doesn’t mean it’s not a shitcoin.

The FDIC deposit guarantee only covers the first $250,000 you have on deposit with a bank
Are you supremely confident that your bank will never go broke?   Do you have funds on deposit with a bank in a mortgage offset account?   Do you have retirement savings?  Have you ever sold a house and had funds in transit from one bank to another?
There are plenty of circumstances where people could lose their life savings because they were exposed to a bank failure where they had more than $250,000 on deposit.  
Maybe a low chance of losing your life savings is perfectly acceptable to you.  Many other people don't think that is acceptable and would like to diversify their risk profile.

Litecoin has a 21 million maximum coin supply (same as Bitcoin). Vertcoin does not.

Based on my 10 seconds of research it looks like Bitpanda controls your private keys and not you.  Because you do not control your private keys you cannot take the Segwit 2 coins which will be created on a parallel chain on the fork date.

There are plenty of people who run full nodes part of the time and then turn off those computers and disconnect them from the internet.   Those full nodes have a complete back up of the blockchain up to the point they were turned off.
