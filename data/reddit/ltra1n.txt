Great community. The original gold standard of crypto paving the way for others and the future.

10 bitcoins used to be worth less than a cent.

If whatever is going on can happen to one exchange, couldn't it happen to another?

+10 doge verify 
Not all communities are bad shibe.

It is discussion. I'm asking where I can buy bitcoins. You guys are way worse than the doge community when it comes to being new.

Yeah I mined in early 2010 for funsies. Got around 10 coins, lost them in Mt. Gox. Bailed on BC and just check in from time to time longing for what would have made my life infinitely better by now.

I didn't. I know Cryptsy and Mt. Gox robbed me of my chance at this and crushed my spirit for BC. I just wanna eat better this week is all.

I'm getting an avg. of 120 Mhash's right now, is it worthwhile to join in?
@_date: 2011-06-14 13:52:34
totally donation based! 
Sorry to hear about the bail situation... I really am a bondsman though. PM me your status and maybe I can help. After all, what are friends for?
@_date: 2011-08-22 14:28:48
I'd like it if still available

This is not good news.
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:07:19
So the exact plot of the Walmart episode?

I know how mining works. That's also wrong. You get 25 from blocks.
I've been around longer than the media newbies. I mined an entire block of namecoins, they just didn't take off.
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:01:45
I have an entire block of namecoins... I wish I'd converted to bit at the beginning.

Heh 'murica.
 I'm sorta bitter I guess because instead of sticking with it I moved places where the electricity was higher and did other things for a while. Once I heard the buzz in the media I started to hunt for my old information. Today I found my public address. My wallet should be here somewhere.
