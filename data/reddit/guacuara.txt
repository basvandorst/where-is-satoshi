Bcash is garbage. Wait til it bottoms. After every ath we had a healthy pullback... could be 6000 or less.. nobody knows

Bitcoin is having a healthy pullback, same as after every all time high, before going to new highs.

There is still something going on... 
But It‘s nothing serious imo
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:31:26
All you doing is complaining. You sound like one of them. Bitcoin wasnt built in a day and it’s development is progressing. In the meanwhile we are under continous attack. They are trying to divide the community and misled newcomers. All this negativity is not productive
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:29:07
Sure. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:22:11
Well done
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:00:11
Lmao. This is ridiculous
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:07:43
Tired of this bitcoin cash bullshit! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:23:55
The empty talk is the result of peoples uncertanties and fears because of lack of understanding of the values behind their investments. Many people are here just to make a quick buck and dont even read the whitepapers. It‘s sad because crypto is such an interesting and exciting space. There is so much to learn and to grow from..
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:09:26
We are far away from a bubble imo
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:56:43
Definitly. Probably higher
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:19:27
Satoshi‘s whitepaper are the rules. If you change the rules it becomes something else

The real value of bitcoin and cryptos is not the money it makes you. The real value of bitcoin and cryptos is freedom. Now I dont know if bitcoin or another cryptocurrency will free this world from the chains of this criminal financial system, but I believe it‘s a big step into the right direction. Let‘s make this happen!
