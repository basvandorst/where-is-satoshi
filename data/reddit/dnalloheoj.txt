Greatly appreciate the reply. That was sort of my next guess, in that being able to reject USD was either outdated (For when people preferred to deal in trades, etc) or more as a "future-proofing" type deal that you described (Economy tanks, etc). 
Thanks again.

The problem with them is that while the overdraft fee is low, you're pretty powerless when it comes to avoiding it (Aside from not overspending, obviously) as there's no way to quickly deposit funds unless you also have a local bank account. 
Obviously paying .04$ instead of 35$ is the better option, but avoiding the overdraft in the first place is ideal. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 16:40:23


There's got to be more security to this than your implying, yeah?
Just because I trust someone to send me 100$ doesn't mean I trust them with my debit card number. That seems crazy. 
I realize they still need the CCV code and what not, but still, I hope I'm missing something here.

Every single business ever. Kind of unrelated since this is more about personal finances, just giving an example.
Still, though, got 3-4 roommates and you all share utility bills? Checks are a good way to go. 
Why bother getting off my ass to go get a cashiers check/money order when I can just pull out my checkbook and an envelope?
@_date: 2014-06-20 07:45:51
Walmart does it for 3$-6$ depending on the size of the check.
As someone who used to be financially idiotic and would live paycheck to paycheck (Or more accurately, overdraft to overdraft), their check cashing service was actually really useful for me. Sure, I was still paying 4$ to cash a check every two weeks, but at least I wasn't paying +35/70$ in overdraft fees as well, and I eventually pulled myself out of that slump. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 15:54:37
That makes sense, but I guess I'm still having somewhat of a difficult time imagining a scenario where you'd be selling something but wouldn't accept USD (In the US, that is). Is it just a general way of refusing service, or are there actual instances where it's beneficial to not accept USD (Trades, maybe?)?
@_date: 2014-10-31 15:28:16
Isn't that the same thing? A payment is really just a debt settlement at the time of purchase, no?

Sure it does. Tell me where I can sign up for my free money if it doesn't have to do with the university?
That's right, I can't unless I'm an MIT undergrad.
Finding 20$ in your cabinet isn't a profit. The profit of cleaning your cabinets is having clean cabinets. It's recovering lost funds. Unless you're saying you found the previous tenants 20$, in which case it's still hardly a profit in accounting terms. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 09:37:53
I don't know that I'd call it free money when you're paying $45k/year just to get in the door. More like buying a boat and getting a $500 Visa Gift Card or something.
I realize the funds were all raised by donors, but still, as a student I'd have a hard time seeing that as entirely free money. That's not to say I wouldn't spend it like it was free money, though..

The only people I know that know of that meme were already Bitcoiners themselves. I don't think that video had much of an effect on the general population at all.

Fair point. Stopped watching John Oliver about a year ago so I wasn't aware of that.
That probably put a lot of people off but I don't think it changed the opinions of older generations too much. 
Hell, my Dad (~60y/o) "forbid" me from mining Bitcoin on our home network (Because it was also his work network - Self hosted IT stuff) back in ~2012 and then about 6 years later asked me how many BTC I had at any point (Highest was like ~12) and told me I was crazy for getting rid of it. 
My response was basically "YEAH, THANKS"

Thanks for this. Very simple to understand explanation.
Question though. What's stopping someone from taking that 20BTC purchase backed by 10$, withdrawing, and spending those coins before the value of bitcoins drops? Or simply withdrawing and hoarding them?

Ahh! Gotcha.
Thanks again. could use more good souls like you.

Not surprised. A while back there was a "Walmart Money Card to Dwolla to MtGox" method of converting cash into bitcoins and a very similar situation happened to me.
Already had a money card, so I figured I'd give it a try. Attempted to add 20$ to Dwolla, and it said Pending for about 3 days, Credited for a day, then got an email saying "It never went through" another day later, and another email from the MoneyCard service saying why it didn't go through. Long story short, I had 20$ in my Dwolla account that got reversed a day later for "Never going through". 
This was like.. 3 weeks ago. You'd think they would've learned by now. 
@_date: 2012-08-07 01:57:26
You're definitely going to want to research the terms of your "free electricity" that you think you have. It's very likely that if one unit starts drawing 4x more power than the others, they'll do something about it. 
That said, with the difficulty increase coming up, you're probably going to want to extend that time frame a bit, and to add to that, many people will tell you that GPU miners are going to be obsolete soon enough, so keep that in mind.
Another thing, you're probably doing your calculations based on best case scenarios on a miner that's running 24/7, as most people do. Unless this is going to be a computer that you don't plan on using *at all* for any reason other than mining, you're going to want to scale back those numbers a bit. 
Lastly, it should go without saying, but realize that only two months ago bitcoins were at less than half the price they currently are at. Now, this could work in your favor, or it could do the exact opposite.
Here's what I'll say. If you have 1000$ (Or whatever you planned on spending) that you can safely blow right now, go for it. But if you're someone who's living paycheck to paycheck and you think that building a bitcoin miner will help add a little extra income then for the love of god, please, please don't do it. My completely honest opinion is that this isn't a very good idea, though, and I'm not trying to criticize you, just sayin'. 
@_date: 2012-08-07 03:43:35
My intent isn't to discourage you from doing it despite what it may seem. If you've got the money, go for it. My main point, I guess, is that if you're buying this rig as somewhat of an 'investment,' then take it just as seriously as you would a real investment, and take every possible thing into account. If it were a bitcoin mining rig that was also going to double as your gaming pc it's a little easier to justify spending however much money because you'll still get use out of it if the plan fails, whereas if this went wrong in any way (From increased energy costs to bitcoin prices to hardware failures) you'd be out a bit of money unless the parts were salvageable.  
There's been far too many college students who come through these subreddits that think that running a huge computer in their dorm room 24/7 won't cause any issues and they'll suddenly be making 100$ a month by just leaving it on, so I just like to dispel those false hopes before they get carried too far, apologies, since that's clearly not your situation.

A few options are possible, but I can't really give an end-all-be-all solution. 


Send the usd from my tradehill account to my dwolla account for $0.25 fee.
Send from my dwolla account to my bank's checking account. 
You could try a bitcoin exchange:
 - Please note I've never used this specific website myself, so tread lightly if you do.
Another option: 
Look around. Unfortunately, there's no extremely simple solution, and a lot of the ways to withdraw funds seem to involve Liberty Reserve, Dwolla, or something of that sort.
Someone else can chime in and correct me if any of this is wrong.

Maybe we see different tasks? I see 3x 32 point tasks titled "Search for terms and record the search results" and the 16 that is titled "Search for terms and record search results."
Using a different payment address, or connecting up to a VPN allows me to do more tasks, but I always get the same ones, so I really can't say why you don't see them.

To put it simply, the distinction comes from the difference between being a "Contributor" and someone on the "Forbes Staff". What that means to each individual person is in the eye of the beholder, I guess. 
I do see what you mean, but I'd say you'd be hard pressed to argue that the selection process between being a full-fledged employee of Forbes, and a freelance contributor is quite different. If I busted out a Forbes magazine right now and saw a huge BITCOIN headline, that *would* be a big deal, but it lacks authenticity when it's presented like this.
For what it's worth, [here's a link]( to the How To Become A Contributor page. While it's obvious there is a selection process, it's also quite clear sending an email with a link to your blog isn't exactly the same kind of process one would go through to become an actual employee (Not that that makes their opinions any less valid, but I think you see my point). 


I know what you mean by this (Not arguing with you at all), but watch [this video]( and you might have a chuckle at about 20 seconds in. 
Also, take note of the "Well, if you're a bum/have a criminal record you probably shouldn't apply, because it makes us look bad" I'm sure they don't mean this offensively to anyone, but I think it gives you an idea of the regard they hold their contributors in. ALSO, the "If you don't want readers, we don't want you" bit. Yeah, it makes sense as a news organization that they'd want readers, but essentially that's the only reason they have these contributors. Not necessarily because they value their opinions as much as an actual forbes writer, but because they help broaden their audience. 
tl;dr: In terms of contributors, Forbes is in it for the pageviews, nothing more.

Game subscriptions. 
I'm more than positive that there are a large amount of people who are upgrading their already beastly gaming rigs in order to do some mining. Play WoW? Dedicate one of your two video cards to mining and play with the other one, by the end of the month use a few of the ~10-20 coins you get to pay that wow/swtor/eve/eq/rift/etc subscription. Considering you can already get wow gold or other currencies for bitcoins, it's probably not a stretch to throw game time codes into that mix.
Maybe even bills? I know that's a real long shot, but if you were able to mine bitcoins and directly pay your electricity bill with some of those bitcoins as opposed to having to take 3-4 days to convert it to USD, that'd be pretty slick. Hell, at that point I'd almost want to setup a rig for mining just to negate a good chunk of my monthly utility bill.

I would assume that a nonprofit focused on *ethical use of technology* might have something to say to a guy who's on their board of directors while doing some borderline shady stuff.

Wow. This thing is the real deal. A lot of these sites give you .002btc per job or something similar, but I just made .1BTC in about 10, maybe 15 minutes, and the payout came ~10 minutes after.
That's awesome. Good job with this. 
Edit: 32 minutes later I'm up to .436btc, to give people an idea of how quick this is. ~.01/min is what I was doing. 
@_date: 2012-02-26 00:41:43
Completely understandable, but when I pull in less than 1 BTC per day mining (~.75), getting 1.5 (What I ended up with) for about 2 hours of copy/pasting wasn't bad. And realistically, comparing it to the $0.10 offers you can get for signing up for spam all over the place, this was pretty easy "free money."
That being said, copy/pasting shit about Fisher Investments got old really quickly.

She's just dumb, and willing to say anything they ask her to.


No, it really doesn't. Addicts became addicts because they have an easy source. They're not going to wait 4 days for their new supply to ship and have it *hopefully* show up by then.
And generally, addicts aren't known for their great moderation skills. There's just no way an addict is going to make a shipment last until the next shipment unless they're ordering every single day, and *good luck* with that.

"Reliable" places to buy bitcoins for paypal, yes, but no.  There's not really a quick and easy (Nor safe) way of doing it. You'd have to find someone willing to sell BTC for paypal ( is probably your best bet), which many people won't do because it's very easy for the buyer (Whoever is using paypal) to initiate a chargeback, and paypal almost always sides with the buyer. There's also not really a convenient way to buy via visa or any other credit card either.
A fellow redditor posted [this website]( the other day, and in about an hour of work you can get yourself a bitcoin pretty easily (I just do the 32 and 16 point tasks, as they basically ask for the same info over and over, so you can just keep the windows open that you need and copy/paste over and over and over). Plus, if you have access to a VPN, you can connect up and do all the tasks again (Geosington, if you see this, please yell at me if this is not allowed, there's nothing against it in the FAQ on coinworker).

Not necessarily other information, it just seems weird having a link at the bottom of the page to that says "Get more info!" and redirects you to the information you, presumably, just read. 
Not a complaint, just seemed a bit strange to me. If they had a second page with more information it'd make sense, but it's not really "more info" if it's the same info.
That came out weird, but I think you get the point!
