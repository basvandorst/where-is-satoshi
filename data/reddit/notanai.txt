Yeah.  You know the rules of comedy. It Is easier to joke about stereotypes that fit a demographic you belong to. Silly social convention but that's how it is. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:45:47
You can still get your point across without insulting people.
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:31:57
I'm curious.  Were you trying to play on the black stereotype with blackcoin or was that entirely coincidence? I hadn't noticed it till it was pointed out in the comments.

Assuming your wallet does include that feature. A badly mistyped address in a poorly designed wallet is still possible.

Oh oh. Seems you don't get it.

No it isn't

Foreigner? What does that even mean in the first person? I'm not happy that i understand you. Symptomatic of American cultural hegemony. Kinda impressive.

lol had no clue. Is this a new thing?
@_date: 2014-04-04 23:08:04
I guess you can put it that way. Still feels odd to me. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:25:47
Yeah isn't that just upsetting? Because bitcoin is opensource if it goes mainstream and succeeds Apple would simply include it asa payment system and there is nothing bitcoin can do about it.  Apple on the other hand is the antithesis of opensource.

The problem with bitcoin is that it can't sneak into the life of someone that has no idea what it is in a compelling and easily accessible way. To really gain prominence it must first replicate existing visa/mastercard infrastructure such that I can pay with a bitcoin card through a visa/mastercard POS and we all know that won't happen. 
Barring that I don't see how people who couldn't care less would jump through hoops to get into bitcoin.  Except it gets some essential services that can't be done anyway else.  For example; a driverless car wirelessly paying for a parking spot. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 18:07:12
Yeah what's the point of embracing something you can't spend 90% of places? "They" not only own the "shitty dollar" , "they" own the underlying infrastructure that enables global finance and "they" own most big businesses everyone relies on. So no matter how shitty it is, if fiat remains my only option it's going nowhere.

Judging by what I think of big banks,  I'll say buy everything. 
@_date: 2015-11-20 14:37:37
I have always wondered,  is it really possible to cash huge amounts of bitcoin? Like millions ? I don't see it as a very liquid asset. So why do these bad guys even bother? 
@_date: 2015-10-31 21:11:44
He can't

I don't trust you
@_date: 2015-02-07 20:01:34
Haha guys.  The execution is pitiful. The idea is sound.  I guess that's what I wanted to say. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 17:02:10
Please pending your full PCI compliance encrypt the card numbers now. Nothing fancy, just regular encryption.  Anyone can implement that. That is the minimum defense you should have. It's not sufficient but it's something. I'm so uncomfortable on your behalf thinking that you have all those cc numbers in pain text one script kiddie away from a lot of hurt for everyone involved. 
Having said that.  Your business is sound and I wish you success.  Quite honestly I don't think you need my wishes I'm pretty certain this would do well. I actually wrote a comment on r/bitcoin some days ago suggesting something roughly similar to this. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:33:00
It takes only two mining pools?

This is very important and could easily determine the success or failure of your business.

JPCoin. Immediately accepted by all businesses. Costs 50% per transaction. Only IBM's Watson can mine it.

I concur entirely. However, given its distributed and open source nature, price volatility is certain to persist for the short term at least. I'm not aware of any bits of bitcoin architecture that caters to price volatility mitigation. And it seems to me that in its infancy an unpegged currency would suffer volatility until widespread adoption provides inertia to resist demand shocks. So in a way bitcoin is a victim of its success as it needs increased adoption which implies increased demand which translates to volatility which leads to speculation and more volatilty which is bad for having a bitcoin balance. There is always the possibility that  I'm just pulling stuff out of my ass.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:14:17
Can you ELI5 why on earth US institutions would adopt bitcoins? Isn't that like abdicating a throne made of angel feathers? I tend to liken it to having a GPU super cluster that mines 100bitcoins per month and also having the rights to determine what Cryptocurrency all businesses use. Then someone comes around preaching litecoins and because of some interesting benefits you decree that all businesses adopt litecoins as well when you could have kept a perfect monopoly.I'm more inclined to imagine this is a rehashing, pardon the pun, of Napster. It would be branded illegal but continue to grow until the elite produce some dumbed down taxable centralized iTunes equivalent.No?

Everyday people don't need to worry about the price of bitcoins but they do determine the price. There are probably a plethora of complex variables working together to determine the price of a bitcoin but I think the two main variables are extent of adoption and forex markets. Basically if there are only 11million bitcoins in existence and there is a  50% growth in  worldwide businesses that accept it with a corresponding increase in goods demanding bitcoins, you can be rest assured the forex markets would make the finite number of bitcoins available in the markets reflect this change in demand.TLDR: Everyday people by direct action or implicitly determine the value of bitcoin.
