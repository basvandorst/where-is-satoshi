And now I’m one of many who aren’t going to cash out quite yet ;-)

Bought 350k DOGE instead of BTC in 2013 because I thought shiba inu’s are cool.

Been up there a few times but every time I see a photo of the building I’m like...wow.
Also, your title was pretty damn funny.

How old was this kid? 35?
@_date: 2018-06-28 14:38:51
I went in with like 80%. Cash flow is good so if I lose it, I make it back eventually.
I feel it’s a once in a lifetime to make a shocking amount of money in a short period of time.
Fortune favors the bold ;)

Thanks, excellent video!

It’s hard to ‘buy the dip’ when there’s been 387.000 dips over the last six months haha
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:06:11
Nice man, congrats!
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:54:36
Luckily there’s more to blockchain than bitcoin.

Haha well, this place genuinely baffles me sometimes ;-)
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:56:31
So we go sideways forever and you decide to sell during a serious dip? gg wp

Don’t worry, we’ll turn bullish after Chinese New Years. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 15:19:13
I agree. Even though it’s a gamble, it’s still an educated guess. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:06:46
Very nice, congrats! Hoping to get myself the C63S coupe once we hit some green again ;)

You need to zoom out about a million percent to stop seeing the massive dump ��

This post deserves a lot more upvotes hahaha

TL;DR: there’s all sorts of retarded people in the world who feel they’re owed something.
Such is life.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:03:20
Life doesn’t end after six months, hopefully. Time goes on after which you’ll only pay for your electricity but will keep mining BTC, instead of buying them.

It’s cases like these where SALT is going to help out a lot in the near future. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:30:13
It’s whatever you decide it is for you.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:05:20
It’s the people that need the money the most who feel like BTC may be their winning lottery ticket.
The truth is you’ll probably make more money with bitcoin than with other investments right now, but remind yourself every day that this isn’t something magical. There’s not a thing in the world that’s going to make millions and millions of people ultra rich overnight.
Realize you can lose it all. Honestly. Crypto is so extremely vulnerable to rumors and what not. 
If you disliked the feeling of having financial issues up until now, know it could be worse if you go all, all in.
If you’ve considered all the risks and still feel comfortable losing it all. Go nuts.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:38:03
These conversations with friends and family keep popping up all the time. 
I genuinely don’t want to come across as condescending but a whole lot of you have extremely jealous, stubborn and straight up idiots as friends.
You all do know you get to choose your friends? 
How can someone you’ve been friends with for a long time not trust you on your intelligence and ability to give out good advice? It’s mind blowing to me.
I’d say 99% of my friends got in when I told them to. Trust is the essential foundation of a friendship. Why don’t they trust you on your word?
@_date: 2019-01-25 21:10:49

Underrated comment. Here’s an upvote.
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:43:07
That would make me one happy guy.
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:28:01
I get that. I do.
But have you been reading the posts around here? So, so, SO many people get into crypto to become a FIAT millionaire. Not a Bitcoin evangelist.
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:41:20
You bet on the potential of crypto possibly going mainstream. Or it's technology. It's not intuitive now, but it might be in the near future. 
It's also not intuitive because it's new in every way. So there's nothing to compare it to. It's like learning a new language. Although it's a relatively simple one :)
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:58:49
I hear you. But publicity still doesn't make something mainstream. Most people are fence sitters. They want the least amount of risk possible and will wait until the absolute last moment to jump in. Until they're practically forced to.
The crypto space is buzzing and being part of it makes it look like it's all there is, but I'm surprised every time by the amount of people who have the slightest clue of what crypto is. There are far more people who don't know what it is than people who do.
But perhaps our definition of mainstream just differs :)

I guess it shouldn't surprise me to read about the conflicts in the Middle East on here. Considering it's even discussed in the comments section of Ed Sheeran videos on YouTube.

There's a million ways to help someone out. Besides giving them something they already have enough of.

600$? Jesus Christ I made that a month till the age of 24.

Just teasing a bit. It’s good you want to give them the full package.

Let’s get hostile towards people who haven’t used bitcoin up until now. That will really drive adoption.
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:10:11
Thanks man. Just wanted to transfer all my coins to my Ledger. Had BTC stored on a paper wallet up until a few minutes ago.
Went with Segway as suggested, you guys rock.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:23:19
Thanks for clearing that up man. I’m with you on that one.
There’s actually an interesting study which concluded that after a monthly income of about $8000, more money doesn’t add to your happiness anymore.
It buys you more options, not more happiness.
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:03:20
That's what I thought. But it seems clear to me more and more people who get into crypto do it to become millionaires overnight. I really doubt most of them will be able to hold as well as the early, early adopters.
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:33:16
Say to yourself you don’t need to win every argument.

Being aware of the existence of something doesn't make it mainstream. Just because a lot of people are aware of bitcoins existence, doesn't make it mainstream.
When's the last time you had to explain to someone what a cellphone is?
Go around town and ask people what bitcoin actually is. Hardly anyone knows. And even less people own crypto. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:21:20
The 'hypothetically' wasn't clear enough? Can't we do a little mental masturbation and talk about hypothetical scenarios? Or shall we just go back to predicting what the market is going to do the next 27 minutes? :)
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:49:12
Wrong? It literally takes the observational skills of a child to see what many of the people here are in it for. 
It would be strange to think everyone is in it for the same thing, wouldn't it?
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:17:19
If you start investing once anything because mainstream and used by everyone, everywhere. You're going to be a bit late to the party.

Your hedge fund buddies are full of shit.
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:09:48
That has to be one of the most ridiculous comparisons I've ever read :-)
Just because FIAT declines in value, doesn't make it useless. And not everyone is a crypto purist who believes it'll replace FIAT completely.
Good luck paying your rent with bananas.

It means Ledger Nanos are becoming more popular among crypto enthusiasts.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:08:57
Not sure what a change address is.
The BTC was sent from Bitstamp -&gt; Paper Wallet -&gt; Bread Wallet -&gt; Ledger S
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:48:40
You can buy with CC on bitstamp too. Fee is 8% though cause it's a direct buy.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:20:28
400k per year is a ‘reasonable’ life style?

As far as I know you can buy BTC online literally anywhere without a phone ��
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:56:10
That’s just wrong on so many levels.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:12:45
Not really.. that transaction was done directly from the Bread wallet on my iPhone to my Ledger’s address. How could it be sent to two addresses?
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:29:53
Thanks for clearing that up. Appreciate the quick response.
I’ll just keep everything safe and sound on my Ledger and wait it out.
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:38:16
You can pay with cash money money ��

I’m genuinely happy I got mine. It’s so easy to use and having all of my coins and tokens on one place takes away all storage headaches.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:28:21
Now I’m extra confused.. just noticed the two transactions went to two addresses. Just saw it in Bread. But that makes no sense because I scanned the QR of the Ledger address.. why would the addresses be different?
Bread is empty btw. And thanks for the help so far. Appreciate it!
