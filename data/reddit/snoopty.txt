Unpopular opinion but based on what happened last cycle and my own distrust of people calling prices in media, it is very very far from a certainty. I give it &lt;1% it hits 100k before 2021.
A lot of it is just pure bullshit. If I knew for certain, or even could guess there was a reasonable chance a currently 10k asset would hit 100k in the near future, I would be eating ramen and refinancing my property, instead of yelling about it on social media.

While you make good points, you will also fail to convince the correct people. I've talked with many idiots and they have absolutely no problem compromising on security, stability or pretty much anything as long as txs are fast and free.
This, incidentally, is why I think libra will eat more of bitcoin's lunch than most people here will expect, if it makes it to launch. People just don't care about all that stuff and you can't make them care. Heck, every single day people think they are sending Elon Musk 2 eth and will soon get 4 eth back.

And if your bet had been correct and the price dropped further, would your worldview be "due to my hard work and smart trading I made a lot of money investing"? 
Never do anything out of politeness where serious money is concerned. To the guy who visited you, it's just business. He is paid a salary to be friendly to clients and does his job well. He has seen countless people become rich or ruined regularly. There's nothing wrong with becoming friendly with him, but you took it one step too far and turned the friendliness into trust. You trusted that he and his company would never screw you over.
You said you did a lot of due diligence and research but 1. missed the fork news that everyone and their grandma knew about for a long time, and 2. neglected to read the terms of the contracts you entered into.
Lastly, you felt that you had this magic bullet which had served you well throughout your short trading career, which is basically "never sell at a loss", which is all fine and good until the trend continues and you eventually find out you cannot sell at all.
You are basically that stereotypical guy in the movies who gets hustled into a casino and ends up playing a game he just learned 5 minutes ago with his entire fortune on the line, with predictable results. 
With all that said you certainly have my sympathy. It's easy to type all this out and make you look foolish but better men have lost their fortunes on the market.

Translated most of it, I don't care about reposts, give me credit if you want, this is a throwaway account anyway.
I'll use Chinese for this - with regards to Satoshi's identity, actually we have a very reasonable standard. Bitcoin was created on mathematical concepts, let's believe the math. If you are Satoshi, there's only one way to prove it, do you have his private key? Without the key, we are all Satoshi. Today I can say as well, that I am Satoshi..."
- altercation here - 
I was just talking about our standard, but he got angry instead. He wants us to pick a side, can you call this rational thinking?
Right, let's continue. Everyone here today is Satoshi, because there's no way to prove you aren't him either, there's no private key. Until the private key proves you aren't Satoshi, we are all Satoshi. If you want to prove you are Satoshi, it's simple. Just sign with your private key. 
We are using maths to protect our property. What we need is faith in this idea, or your money will be under the control of others. Why do we choose bitcoin? Why not other cryptocurrencies, or rather, just partly in other cryptocurrencies? Because we believe in the maths. Don't put your faith in human nature and sensibilities, just believe in one thing - as long as we have the key, we are Satoshi. If you lost the key, even if you were Satoshi, you wouldn't be able to prove it. Some &lt;inaudible&gt; you have to challenge, with logic and rationality. Craig is a fake Satoshi, and extremely rude too. While he was speaking, I respected him. I just wanted to propose a mature, accepted standard for our industry, to establish whether someone really is Satoshi. However he was so rude, and even wanted us to pick a side. Do you guys really want to pick a side? What if Taiwan only had a single political party? This is an insult to our democratic society. How did we get to the point where we are meeting up here today? It's because we respected everyone's freedom of speech. Craig is a disgrace upon this community. I just wanted to have a peaceful discussion, and yet he, over and over again - he did the same yesterday at the closed-door meeting - he wanted us to pick a side, "Either he goes or I go" and he continued to do so today. He's a disgrace of Australia, a disgrace of our entire community. Thank you.

Sure, but there's no real grounds for arguing that in this particular case, the guy transferred his btc and just wants them back as per the contract. 
If you are fortunate enough to guess a private key containing btc, it's up to your own morals whether you take it or not, the code certainly isn't stopping you. There are people running scripts scanning for deposits to popular brainwallet addresses and I'd imagine they would argue finders keepers.

@_date: 2019-08-02 06:07:45
Why would it be a scam? If anything it would be one of the most trustworthy alts since the founders actually stand to lose a lot if it flops, instead of spending the ICO funds on hookers and blow.

I think your proposed version would make things more awkward than they have any right to be. I'm sure you know that 千野 is Japanese, so you would have half your name in Chinese and half in Japanese. A Chinese person who consumes modern media might be able to grasp that after some confusion, but I don't know how Japanese readers would see it, seeing as you want them to pronounce half of it one way and the other half in a language they aren't familiar with. 
Think of a hard to pronounce name in French, because it uses the same letters as in English - Yves St Laurent for example, most English speakers would butcher it. Your name would be something like Juan St Laurent. There's no chance anyone gets it right.

You put your finger on it exactly. Bitcoin doesn't have any evil-destroying properties written into its code. 
In Venezuela today it would be more practical to hold USD instead, because of the rapid inflation. However, people are interested about BTC in Venezuela because we can all see a use case there, and I don't mean turning bolivars into lambos.

I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm saying I could spend all my money to send that spike up to $100 or $1000 and it wouldn't make any difference to anybody outside of that one point in time. As long as I'm not dedicated and rich and evil enough to continuously spam the mempool, it will clear up. I've been doing a fair bit of transacting these past few weeks and 1-2 sat txs are still clearing at a good rate.
I would expect average transaction fees on that graph to rise across the board as people do more segwit and batching transactions, bundling many transactions together. Also there are people/organizations who will always pick the highest possible fee because they feel a transaction is important to them, or they are making good money and don't want to risk losing a single customer. These will push the average up, but the majority of transactions are 1-5 sats and still clear at a very healthy rate.

Nowadays our wallets function more like wallets in that they automatically scoop up the remainder into change addresses that are generated from the same original seed.

The correlation proves nothing, or am I the one taking crazy pills?

I don't see any connection between block rewards and transfer fees.

From personal observations, I believe these are the main ways people lose their private keys to others:
1. using malicious crypto-related sites or software: bad wallets, seed generators etc
2. malware on computer: possibly already infected, vulnerabilities in common software, or downloaded weird stuff
3. exchange-related problems: stuck because of noncompliance, exchange got hacked etc
4. social engineering: getting tricked into downloading fake software, phishing, fraud and scams etc
Most of these can be 99.9% avoided by knowing what to look out for.

Haven't you heard? All of them are better than bitcoin in all those categories. Until they run into problems.

Awesome idea, something others may have highlighted though is that it's easy to guess the correct answer and still have problems with case sensitivity, spaces, etc.

Sure but let's not pretend that even if the retailers accepted bitcoin, they wouldn't sell it on the spot for USD.

I only get the organic sugar and butter and eggs, so it should cost even more

Miners can also just short BTC at a comfortable price and keep on mining through a price drop.
