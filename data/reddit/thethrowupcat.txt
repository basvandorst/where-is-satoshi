Should clarify: credit cards are getting a fee plus cash advance, debit cards are getting additional fees. Depending on the bank it’s something like “transaction fee” or “international fee”
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:53:30
Relieved to see I am not the only one too. I also made a post about how they changed it so that when you use debit/credit cards it is now charging additional fees, or calling it a cash advance.

When will this subreddit realize that it is better to work WITH each other on BCH AND BTC being successful than working against each other? Seriously...buy, hodl both coins and don't fail to keep the eye on the prize: success and freedom for all.

So when people are putting their buy orders in lower than the current price think of them waiting for the price to come down.
If they dump a bunch on the market without doing it as a limit it would fill all those orders that are lower. This ultimately keeps going until all 1,000 are sold. Because there is not someone buying 1,000 at $17,249, the price would have to keep going down farther and farther until it is filled.
This is why whales control the market volatility in both buying and selling. More money = more power.

This would be a good time to mention the time traveler from 4 years ago, again. He said that a large majority of coins will be held by Saudi Arabia. This gives good reason to why it makes sense to use BTC in the Islamic world.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:19:47
Good point. Because Bitcoin has no interest rate, there is no reason to invest it. If it’s store of value is so strong then we could accidentally create the dark ages where no one moves money other than trade. Stock markets wouldn’t really need to exist.

"Because of the leverage used in futures trading, it is possible to sustain losses greater than one's original investment. Conversely, it is also possible to realize very large profits. Again, it is not that the actual asset a trader is investing in carries more inherent risk; the additional risk comes from the nature and process of how futures contracts are traded. To handle the additional leverage wisely, futures traders have to practice superior money management by using prudent stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Good futures traders are careful not to over-margin themselves, but instead to maintain enough free, uncommitted investment capital to cover drawdowns in their total equity. Trading futures contracts requires more trading skill and hands-on management than traditional equity investing."

I just got mine and I love it. Only problems are:
* Can't put Ripple on with all my other alts, which sucks I thought I'd be able to
* I was using Coinbase/GDAX to send, and now I am realizing the impact of fees (holy shit it's bad)
* Doesn't using a Chrome App make it vulnerable to an attack in the future? Maybe I'm crazy, I guess I don't understand the whole backend protections of the device
Otherwise, I love the thing. It is really so much safer than keeping it on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:41:18
It just hit 17,250. I was certainly agreeing with this that it would disappear. But it looks like it is getting eaten up slowly. Very surprised by this. Nothing is crazy in the crypto world.

In my opinion, this is the mania of the bubble. New tech goes through bubbles, it's healthy. Lots of people are gonna lose money and panic out. Especially the people who are buying now for the first time in the 10k+ territory. It isn't regulated, so of course it makes it much more challenging. Big thing to think about is that this is global, and accessible. Unlike the Beanie Baby, it has a widespread purpose for existence aside from looking cute in a McDonalds Happy Meal.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:20:14
It's not extravagant to say that futures put a lot more risk into the game.
We're already parabolic at this point.

I would argue that using mBTC would make more sense for the typical user. Even the option to easily speak in terms of mBTC or display mBTC makes sense.
In one way, this could create more price inflation as it would make it easier to understand for mass adoption. When people see $17,200 (current price) that is pretty intimidating, I don't think your average buyer wants to drop $17,200. But that is just how we are taught to think.
If I saw $17.20 mBTC as someone new to the market that would make me think 'yeah, I can buy that...also, I can buy mBTC? what is mBTC, I only know what BTC is...'
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:03:53
Wait seriously? So technically you’re supposed to pay taxes on that? Makes sense since you are “exchanging” for a good in USD.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:25:13
It's a double edged sword, just like everything else in this market. It's 100% speculation.
If traders lose money, then fuck 'em right?
If traders win a bunch, then they're gonna keep betting. It is kind of like the market is getting ahead of itself and realistic valuation in the mid-term gets a lot riskier and lines it up for a crash. Lot's of 'if' though, all we can do is watch and HODL.

I hear what you're trying to say, however I can't send a Beanie Baby to someone in a small town in South Asia from the US in 10 minutes...then have that same person use that Beanie Baby to buy food and clothes in the same day...it's just a bit different.

I think that it is a shady market. The more you read into the community the more you realize there are trading bots doing a lot of algorithmic readings and making quick movements happen in the minute to minute market.
If a blockchain currency used by everyone wants to exist, it has to go through some pretty horrific realizations of its flaws before it is perfected for 7 billion people.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:03:25
Am I wrong by saying this is also what is causing the rapid rises and falls in the price?
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:23:16
I won't disagree with that. However, I see blockchain ICO's giving the breakaway for starting businesses in a new social way rather than a top down way. Provided someone builds the right business model off the blockchain, they could include hundreds of thousands of new investors from all over the world. Meaning this technology could be expansively more profitable.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:18:03
Right, I️ should clarify: using a credit OR debit card works (at least my bank lets me for now) to process instant payment.
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:59:10
You're right. I wouldn't want to wait 17 years either. I believe that people understand technology a little better now than they did then though.
I just think about all of the other big advancements like electricity, cars, roads, planes, on and on and on. All these took time to develop. If bitcoin and blockchain is still "early" then that means it could take a lot longer for us to see these prices again.
I know one thing, this bubble needs to correct.
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:00:31
True, and what is different about bitcoin is that 1. it is not a company so it can't be necessarily compared in this way because it doesn't make sales and 2. it offers so much more than just a product of exchange, it does a lot more socially too.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:19:00
What I find to be a very important factor in determining price is to look at it in terms of satoshis.
It was no mistake that the bitcoin protocol calls for the smallest denominator to be 0.00000001. There are 100,000,000 satoshis in one bitcoin.
As the price goes up, people will start to realize they can only talk in certain quantities of satoshis and not in whole coins. Whole coins have the potential to hit astronomical levels long term.
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:05:46
ICO's will be important to look at during the bubble popping. If they fall really hard during the bitcoin pop, then that means people are moving their money out of cryptocurrency entirely. If the ICO market stays stable or increases, then that means that crypto currencies will survive easier long term. The money would need to stay in the crypto world for survival.
ICO's are also important because they are just starting. They're just barely getting their funding for the projects. We don't know which ones are real, which ones are fake. We don't know who will succeed and who will be duds. Only time can tell if they can integrate their ideas into society and make the blockchain work in business.
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:13:39
“We don’t know the real value of it yet”
Yeah you don’t...because you can have 0.00000001 of 1 bitcoin. This mathematics shows that it’s not as limited as this pre-conceived notion that it cannot hold value. I just can imagine myself carrying gold.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:23:21
Good point. For anyone who does transfers instead of card it takes about two weeks to process.
What is really silly is that you can’t make these instant payments using GDAX, a coinbase operated exchange.

It's really easy to get caught up in the hype and start goobering over the memes. However, the truth is there is value in Bitcoin, and here is my perspective on why I am bullish and HODL.
1. Blockchain. The technology is admittedly very slow in comparison to existing technologies. However, the problem of double-spending was solved through Bitcoin and it gave birth to other blockchain technologies
2. Time. It takes a long period of time to create a provable and widely distributed ledger. The fact it has even survived to this point is astonishing, an 11-year track record is huge kudos. It is impossible for any future chains to have the longevity the chains of today own.
3. Store of Digital Value. I would like to clarify that I do believe in the store of value model, though I believe we should call it the store of digital value. The difference albeit subtle in spoken language it is substantial in the application. We are truly entering another momentous point for technology and I believe blockchain will be a part of that. As more people become a part of the internet they will seek out ways to store value in the non-physical realm.
4. Security of Information. As the troubles with data dumping, security flaws, and Facebook data collection standards become more well known I believe people will seek out new forms of securing information. Likely Bitcoin will not be the only blockchain solution, although in order to understand blockchain you need to understand the most simple application use: Bitcoin.
5. Ecosystem Development. I am bullish lastly because the ecosystem is still very new. The UX and UI for more blockchain apps are garbage today. Users are not excited to use an app because it says "Bitcoin" or "blockchain" in fact I think those are detractors because you are expected to have previous knowledge. As more people outside of this small niche group begin to use applications that make Bitcoin and blockchains easy to use it won't matter anymore. Think of it like this: no one is screaming at you about the wonders of SMTP to send emails, people simply understand "email".
@_date: 2019-12-26 16:28:50
The second you start talking about investing or money you're in hot water. If you talk about decentralized platforms and their functionality that is totally different.  
If you are going to continue to do this work I would highly recommend not suggesting which coin people should invest into etc. There will likely be another boom and this time YouTube doesn't want to be held accountable when people lose tons of money on shitcoins. I am not saying you're a shill, I am saying that you could accidentally get caught into being a shill unknowingly!  
If your videos were very technical and spoke to the features of cryptography then it would also probably be ok. Think of it like this, what if every app for Web2 went onto YouTube and said "invest into my app today!" Everyone would be scared shitless of being cracked down on by the SEC, rightfully so. Sorry this is happening to you bud.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:08:55
A little bit of both.
See how MS flatlined? Notice it created a new price target it would not fall below. It gained public confidence.
If you look closely at bitcoin, it does the same thing in 2014. However the movement is much much much larger now. This staggering increase is what all tech companies are seeing right now.
So now it is speculative in all aspects of technology. We are going to discover more and more flaws, as we are seeing with centralized hacks on places like Target, Home Depot and Equifax. Next comes the hacking of tech companies. We've seen this already at Sony, Ashely Madison etc.
As the hackers get better and more intimidating, the price will fall in tech because people are afraid. However, some people will see through the crap and realize the that once a solution comes around this product is extremely valuable.

@_date: 2017-11-19 22:24:43
I agree with you. I additionally see the other perspective of why the technology needs more advancements for it to take off to a mass adoption phase instead of a collectors phase. But with the right explanations I think mass adoption can occur. UI is so important at this point.

He is asking legitimate questions. It's all fine here on Reddit when we are all getting this circle jerk mentality of down with big government. Don't get me wrong, I don't like EVERYTHING my government does, if I did I would be a fool. But can we not observe that yes terrorism doesn't actually kill a lot of people is that a result of 1. the measures the government has put into place or 2. the fact that terrorism simply does not matter. I tend to think  is more the case.
The big issue with all forms of encryption will always come down to these big questions like Obama presented here (old video).
Would you be ok with a world where small militias policed cities? Each city you went to there would be a different policing force with different attitudes and limited oversight? Americans are very normalized to a federal legal system. I do not think anyone in this subreddit has the solution to these incredibly challenging problems.

Casey is one of the best pioneers of social media usage. He leveraged himself as a brand, and he saw this in Shonduras too.
BEME didn't do so well on its own, however CNN buying BEME was a strategic move and I can't say that it was unsuccessful. I mean hey, he sold the damn thing.

That is why it is a speculative game.
I am leaning on the side that we have the resources now to start putting more affordable technology into the hands of people. This will create a need for things like blockchain and bitcoin. If not now, then soon. It's going to happen. We've seen globalization occur in lots of ways, this just happens to be one of those ways.

Get the BCH then get this BCH hard fork. Sell those off and buy your Tesla you want, just get a model 3 and try to find one used if you can.
Sell part of the BTC for cash in a high yield savings like Ally.
Sell part of the BTC for a down payment on a house (wait for a market crash in housing if you’re patient)
Sell part of the BTC for an investment into the stock market. Try betterment or wealthfront. Both great products.
Put some of your BTC into a new Binance account. Get yourself some top tier coins with like 2-5BTC and sit on those.
Start a college fund for your kids (or soon to be)
Here is what you should not do:
Buy a fancy car
Pay for an entire house
Buy liquor for friends at parties
Tell people you ran into a bunch of cash or BTC
Tell family you ran into cash or BTC
Don’t sell all of it
Don’t HODL all of it
Use a bunch of money on vacations
Use a bunch of money on a wedding
Buy fancy clothes or tech
Best of luck and congrats

The issue to really watch is millennials as they enter the next crisis, here is why:
-They are one of the largest generations
-They have diverse portfolios of debt at higher interest rates
-Credit cards are heavily marketed to millennials
-Student loans can be an evil necessity for a small majority, meaning all the weight of student loan debt is on a concentrated group
-Consumer spending trends haven’t changed much with them
-Jobs market and wages outside of college is posing a serious threat to income over time
I think millennials are going to continue to be blamed for a lot. Additionally I think enough of them will think that Bitcoin is a solution to their debt problems which makes for a good bull case. Especially because as far as awareness and trust in bitcoin millennials and Gen Z are the highest ranking.
