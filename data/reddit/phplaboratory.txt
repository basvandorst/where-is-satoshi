MagicalTux , In this situation you can keep you face and be a Man!

Thats you choise.

From one side, yes, need someone "cleaner". 
But from other side this can help save reputation, so he will be motivated to do the best. Sometimes all making mistakes.

Last month MtGox maked 4000 BTC (1% of deals).
So company costs 4K * 12month = **48K BTC**
if Mark lost 750K BTC , then we can get from sale company to third party investor only: (48/750) * 100 = **6.4% of our balance** .
Why we need do this, if **all of us can be investors** and can create **great precedent to Bitcoin** itself.

Its not so easy, Roger had built "white" transparent scheme for honest Bitcoin business. But in any time bitcoinstore can dive into something like Tor. But in this case US government will take a fig in taxes and bitcoinstore recieve a lot of happy clients with lower prices.

Whole bitcoin community can win, if project like MtGox started to be **open and transparent**. 
Lets contact Karpeles, to change model of gox business will started to be open to communiy, rent third party audit and share ownership of mtogox to users, 
**proportionall amount of there Bitcoin balance**. And return fiat money to customers, as if there is not enought fiat money in mtogox bank, then Mark will be in jail soon.
