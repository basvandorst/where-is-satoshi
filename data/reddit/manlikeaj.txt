And it will still be undervalued!
Roll on $1,000,000

Buy the dip...

The boy is young though I am assuming. A balanced portfolio can wait, go big or go home...

Transfer to GDAX first and save on transaction fees

"Old generation" Bitcoin is not set in stone though and can and is being constantly improved?

So, you're single?...
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:15:09
I may not have a lot of BTC but what I do have is now on my Segwit wallet on my ledger :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:07:07
You picked a good time to buy
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:24:48
Hey! I still wasn't done buying BTC...
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:54:02
Guys, what would you recommend is the best way for someone like myself to get their first Bitcoin?
I know the safe option would be to just keep buying smaller %s until that total reaches a full bitcoin but I don't have that much spare money that I could put into Bitcoin given the current price and I assume it will rise over the year too. I have been thinking about starting trading and hopefully jumping on something with a bit of hype that I can use to increase my BTC%.
Is this too risky a strategy or do any of you think this is a good idea?

HODL until Feb? That's very short sighted no?

What a gesture, I’ll take one....?
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:48:54
BTC, LTC, ETH, NEO, XMR

Give it another two years and buy a mansion!...

What's peoples thoughts on a possible correction/dip? I am in BTC and LTC for the long run but I can't help feel the % rises we have seen this month alone will have to come down at some point?
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:58:01
Crazy that you're even considering selling just now.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:31:31
Congratulations bro! 
What's the next % target? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:26:30
Excellent, just don't panic sell now!
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:56:16
You don't know me fam. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:42:17
When/where is the dip? 
I'm waiting on an excuse to increase my BTC % before the New Year!
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:52:16
I've just bought a little bit more BTC and transferred it to my segwit address on my ledger. 
I wish I could transfer the BTC I have on my breadwallet over to this address also but the transaction fee is ridiculous! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:13:49
Holding both Bitcoin and Litecoin myself
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:21:53
I did also! 
Although now I can’t move my BTC to it because the transaction fee will be too high compared to my amount of BTC I would be transferring. One day maybe...

Trading BTC for an iPhone? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:27:55
Give them a book about cryptocurrency and see if you can get them interested in it?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:47:35
Moral of the story....Don't sell.
