I was able to claim it using IE11 if that helps. Thank you!

For a second I thought it was an April fools joke. Courts most likely will interpret this order anyway they see fit just to win their online cases.

I did unencrypt it, still got that error message. 
But when I use that one backup everything works perfect.

thanks for the help. at least i was able to recover the private key for 15godkid.  so i guess the address is somehow within my wallet but not physically accessible.

Maybe it was somehow there, but it was not in the Receive coins tab of qt.

It returns a private key, but when i try to import it returns **Error adding key to wallet (code -4)**

I understand the change address part but why is the private key for the change address not retrievable from todays wallet but my backup wallet from a month ago, i was able to dump the private key.  *However I can't import the address*, so i'm guessing the change addresses cannot be imported into the ui?

So I just used another backup and was able to retrieve the address and import the private key. So now I know my coins are safe. 
Although I have my coins now, it is very weird how I had to go back through so many backups to find the "right" wallet to retrieve my private key and import the address. I guess that's the purpose of a backup.
thanks guys for the help

So there is no way of viewing the change address? Also when i ran getaddressbyaccount "" it was just the 4 addresses in my addressbook.

@_date: 2013-04-08 14:20:17
output was
**Private key for address 15GoDKid4X25yLEErS4b6gPQeqfcJVRJLa is not known (code -4)**
I tried that before even with my backup wallets and no luck either.
Should I send the entire amount in my wallet to another address and see if it gets confirmed.  
Or should I send the available amount shown on blockchain to a new address and than after that gets confirmed send the remainder amount shown in my wallet.
thanks for the help :)
Edit: So I was able to use windows backup feature and was able to retrieve the wallet the day after that transaction. it returned a private key.  but when i run getaccount it does not do anything, no output of any sort.
