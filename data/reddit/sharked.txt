How many NMC are you bagholding?  Better pump that price, if you want to get out of this shitcoin.

I'm not too sure that Bitcoin wouldn't be taken over by a more efficient technology by the time he is 18.

Pennies on the dollar?  I use a legit CC paying the correct exchange rate on Amazon. (dollars to yen).  How am I getting a deal?  If I was living in Japan, using a foreign card is still not illegal.

I don't think I could face myself if I lost a bunch of money on a meme coin.  wow. so investment.  much embarrassed.

We still believe there was a guy named Nakamoto Satoshi that built Bitcoin?

They all have coinslots though.

Google searches spike every time you bitcoin neckbeards go long into this dump and look for justifications to bag hold.  
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:43:56
wut?  I just built my new workstation with parts I bought with BTC from tigerdirect.  
@_date: 2014-12-14 04:22:50
probably because they aren't bag holding btc they bought at $1000 like you guys.

What's naive is thinking anything that goes through the internet is private.

Wall St has been in this game since before February.  When everyone was crying about China driving prices down, the real market maker was in New York doing more volume than any exchange in China.  
@_date: 2014-06-20 22:09:34


Not going to happen.  
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:51:32
that is what I figured too.  
@_date: 2014-08-14 05:08:27
Bitcoin turned down to rip apart all those long positions.  
@_date: 2014-12-31 06:56:36
there is nothing private or anonymous about btc.  
@_date: 2014-01-22 16:06:27
I'll have to go pay this guy a visit after work today.

I thought I was a genius when I made my .2 btc into .43 btc.
Of course I was the fool because had I held on I would have over 2btc now.  
@_date: 2014-09-15 01:49:10
I'm sorry more people won't get to see how awesome of a comment that was.

I'm a freelance mographer and I'm in the process of negotiating getting paid in btc from one of my headhunters.  
@_date: 2014-07-04 07:07:13
The jokes on you when the banks inevitably end up with control of the bitcoin supply.  
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:58:30
at the very least.  Dogecoin has made a ton of bitcoins for a few folks. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 15:37:21
Isn't this what Devcoin is for?
@_date: 2015-05-30 07:49:39
This wasn't about drugs.  This was about controlling markets.  
@_date: 2014-01-29 16:20:00
Only 1 of them is hot.  
@_date: 2014-04-09 17:27:13
I'm sure it's also quite disheartening to listen to some neckbeards talking about how they made thousands from mining when so many folks out there are struggling just to make it day to day. 
This is why I rarely talk about BTC in public.  
@_date: 2014-07-06 19:44:57
I'm an ugly guy without shirt trading btc....will that do?
@_date: 2014-06-10 19:06:12
people are going to be upset when they find out big money/big government is using the population to simply beta-test bitcoin.  
@_date: 2014-06-07 21:09:06
no, but the merchant does.  
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:35:31
How far back has institutional traders had access to your api?  I know it was open back when you were still beta.  
Also, let's be honest here.  Coinsetter isn't for smaller accounts is it?
@_date: 2017-02-26 00:04:59
don't worry.  The ETF has no chance of being approved.  
@_date: 2015-01-22 17:41:30
lol Zeta coin.
@_date: 2015-01-10 00:59:38
USD is king right now.  Taking btc now would be silly.  If I was getting paid in  rubles I'd probably go with btc.  
@_date: 2015-01-02 04:32:46
Garza either lost control of the supply of his own coin or he's suppressing the price himself.  The coin will pump again after all the dreamers dump.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was right before his talk.  
@_date: 2015-01-04 20:27:43
he should be in USD for now.  
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:31:46
There are several banks already using the ripple protocol.  
@_date: 2015-01-19 18:31:10
how did the ripple protocol scam anyone?  
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:15:35
You just got so many long positions killed.  
@_date: 2016-06-04 13:33:45
love how folks think the banks and regulators don't have any control over btc.  Coinbase is ran by former Jp Morgan guys.  Coinsetter is also ran by Jp Morgan guys.  Everyone trying to do thing legit have to get a bit license.
Sorry libertarians, but bitcoin will not save you from the shackles of bankers.  If anything it will just tighten their control since it's much easier to track than cash.  
@_date: 2016-11-19 05:26:56
coinbase is going to comply.  this is just trying to save some face.  
@_date: 2016-09-17 20:02:24
that's crypto for you.  
@_date: 2016-09-18 01:39:18
you deal with a business that has no accountability because there little to no regulation on btc and you're surprised you got scammed?   that's pretty crypto.  
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:22:04
because no one knows how to short.  
@_date: 2015-04-17 12:23:08
which exchange runs more volume than anyone on earth?  hint its in nyc and ran by former JP Morgan guys.
btc is denominated against what currency?  btc/???    simple fractions can tell you why btc is getting smashed.   
@_date: 2015-04-16 19:10:00
who do you think controls btc supply and regulation now?
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:00:27
have you ever heard of shorting?
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:57:54
oh ok, I didn't know it was the code that was capping the price of btc for the past year.  The code was the one that past regulation on how btc companies can operate in the US.
@_date: 2015-09-04 21:18:42
This is a good sign.  Bitcoin hopium is fading, maybe we can finally go long. 
@_date: 2016-10-04 20:48:35
bitcoin is never going to counter anything central bank.  
@_date: 2015-11-21 05:13:58
your grandpa controls a $400 million hedge fund?
@_date: 2015-11-07 23:49:09
But he doesn't exist.

None.  Fiat will continue to get printed.

Not just Chinese.  This is how all liquidity providers work.  
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:37:32
100 of you could get together and you will still get crushed by the btc market maker.  
@_date: 2015-02-12 21:35:05
We should be around the same price as 2010 soon. lol

My credit union doesn't give a fuck that I use coinbase.  Leave that criminal institution and go to a credit union or small local bank.

@_date: 2013-12-09 03:45:00
you can mine bitcoins on reddit by karma whoring.  
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:24:34
So jokes and laughs are not allowed in bitcoins?
