I believe there is a monetary incentive.  In an anonymous system like this, that sort of thing is necessary because otherwise people will spam the system with data, or requests to download data.

Someone totally needs to make a novelty account/bot to post this on every forbes article.

It looks like you earn credits by hosting data, and spend credits by downloading data.  I believe this system is a lot like what BitTorrent ends up doing (where you basically "barter" with one peer at a time).
I'm not sure how they keep track of the credits though - maybe that isn't defined by this system, and it's assumed bitcoin can do it.  Then you could essentially pay real currency to have your data hosted, or pay to download.

Sweet stuff.  I don't trust myself storing a key on a computer, but I would on one of these.  Raspberry pi is a key technology for a cryptographic device like this - takes some significant power to do above 512 bits.

I don't think freenet had any sort of monetary system, which left it open to spam and DOSing.  It was very slow when I tried it back in 2001 or so.  But yeah, the concept of anonymous encrypted hosting is nothing new.

Craziness. I bet no scifi book saw this coming.

You gotta keep cool in the bit mines.

Maybe in the future?  Googling for "vps gpu", people said it's possible but very expensive.

Does this mean it's a good or bad time to buy bitcoins?

Clearly, someone could have 51% or more of the computing power with enough resources.  However, I think the best they could do is delay transaction confirmations.. like change the average time to increment the blockchain from 10 minutes to 20 minutes, delaying transactions from or to specific wallets.
However, I think with some basic measures, this could be fixed (if these measures don't exist already).  Instead of picking the longest blockchain, introduce measures to only trust clients that are including more transactions.
Such an attack would have a one-time effect, perhaps destabilizing the currency temporarily while it's fixed.
