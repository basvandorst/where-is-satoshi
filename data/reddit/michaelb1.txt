He’s waiting for bitcoin to reach $130,000 so he can pay off porn stars with just one BTC.

This is about the safest bet I have ever seen. You're going to have to send .01 BTC to all zero people.

No! Everything trump touches go broke. Please don’t ask him to tweet about Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is logic. Humans are not. They’re the opposite.

I’m old enough to remember when Enron stock was skyrocketing year after year.

So you’re saying betting on bitcoin is betting against bankers. I hope you’re right and I hope they lose everything.

For quantum computing to ruin a blockchain one must assume that adversaries have quantum computers but no computers in the blockchain have quantum computer. There’s a zero percent chance of that.

I love the fact that banks fucked up so bad over the past 2 decades that millenials and a lot of us GenX’rs are like fuck it, we’re not playing your game anymore. Meanwhile, banks are trying to act like they didn’t commit slow suicide. They try to wrap that legitimacy blanket around themselves but we see right through it.

I read his book. I’m one of the people that found it to be bullshit. I don’t hate him for it though.

I get it. Platforms like this introduce incentives, game theory, scarcity etc and take a cut of creative content. I just don’t see the value of the platform over a basic donation system on the creators own platform.

I read the book and understand what he was trying to say.  However the human brain is literally a billion times more complex than a lobster brain. There’s simply no reason to deduce appropriate human behavior from a lobster or a salamander or choose your own base life form. 
He made good money and obtained notoriety by telling young adult males that they operate on a dominance continuum.  Good for him, but I think it’s bullshit no different from all the other ‘self help’ books that make a lot of money without actually improving people’s lives. 
Make your bed in the morning like Petersen’s says to do in the book.  Nothing wrong with that.

Yeah when he said it’s will use cryptocurrency I wondered “to do what”?  All you need is cryptocurrency,  not some platform.

Yep. Learn the important life lessons from a crustacean with an brain smaller than a pea.

I’m referring to the subject of the article which is satellite based internet, i.e. mass communication.
