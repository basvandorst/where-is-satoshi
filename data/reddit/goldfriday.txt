I remember when that movie War Games came out in the early 1980s and every 12 year old in the US wanted a modem and eventually flooded the BBS scene with their nonsense. I guess all sanctuaries get destroyed :(

Last friday you tried too! No, you're too serious! No gold for you!
Ok, I'm mocking one guy with a one day old account. Hes kinda funny though. But tulip and wanderer got gold, they're funny dudes.

Do you feel like you want to harm yourself or others?

The second coming of money is serious business. There will be no joking here!

Well to win, you have to keep an account for awhile. Maybe see a shrink and get some happy pills? I hear some take bitcoin.

I invested .0001 in Neo Bee and I'm hoping to buy a Ferrari in a few weeks.

You're a funny dude tulip, gold is on its way. Enjoy!

Sure why not

Oh man you're an early winner. Give me a few minutes to get the wallet rig running.

No no, we just want to get you some help. The cuffs are for your protection.

He hasn't posted in a month and he seems pretty damn angry. I'm looking to encourage the funny people.
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:40:12
I believe your idea and my idea of funny probably differ. Its just the internet, I see no need to be so serious all the time.

As a supporter of the bitcoin troll sect, I fully support this post!

Do you blame yourself?
