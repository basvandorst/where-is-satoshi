Rand Paul is the best candidate out of both parties, bar none. The problem is that the American public is ignorant as fuck and only desire to be emotionally manipulated by the establishment candidates and a billionaire that wants to censor the internet.

Couldn't agree more.

Interestingly enough, the same time we came off the gold standard.

Exactly this. It's amazing how far I can stretch $20-$30 at the penny slots. All the while getting the free drinks, food, etc. I've even staggered away with more money than I came in with on occasion.
@_date: 2014-07-01 18:08:19
What leads you to believe that people would bid more than the current market price? What sense would that make?
@_date: 2014-07-23 18:17:16
Easy. Just hardfork the blockchain like VRC did... /s

Yes, but these sociopaths print money out of thin air with a never-ending supply.
@_date: 2014-04-11 14:26:58
Maybe. 
But really it's just another typo meme like hodl. What was referring to was Admiral Ackbar's "It's a trap" line, and then threw in the "tarp" typo meme for a whole other level of memeness. Basically like memeception. Shit goes several layers deep.

Except eBay took away the possibility for a seller to leave a buyer anything but positive feedback. The stupidest decision they've ever made.

I can't get my head around how this keeps happening... double check the address 3 times before hitting submit, especially on large transfers. It only takes a second to glance at the beginning and ending of the address to notice an anomoly...

This is what a lot of people are not understanding. A Bitcoin is nothing more than buying a full "share" of the system.

How much USD will gold be worth once the dollar loses reserve status and people refuse to take FRNs as payment?
Probably a couple of wheelbarrow's full per gram.
As long as a central bank controls a country's monetary supply, they are the ones in power.

It's quicker and easier in my opinion.

I'd like a gallon of BTC plox.
@_date: 2014-03-04 14:28:34
Yea... when I first joined them to test them I put them as my primary pool. Even though it said I was mining on my second pool I never got accepted shares on my secondary pool.
This lead me to believe that they were actually using my rig and mining for themselves, even when my rig wasn't rented out. Needless to say I haven't used them since.
@_date: 2014-04-04 14:04:55
Yeah, it's fucking stupid.

I'm with you. I wouldn't be embarassed. I think a people put too much emphasis on material things.
@_date: 2014-01-02 14:47:19
Reminds me of that case where the dude did that with his credit card company and they accepted it without checking it. Epic.

Just the tip baby I promise.

20% is a pittance compared to the loss of 50% of your life's savings when wifey gets to feeling bored, neglected, lonely, or hormonal.

So true, fellow spirit vessel.
@_date: 2014-03-17 00:20:12
Having a community is not really innovation though. It's basically a straight inflationary Litecoin clone. I guess the innovation was using a meme for marketing but even memes get old.
Time will tell.

As I understand it, when you call your margin order they have to give you a Playstation back.  If the price has appreciated, the borrower owes you money.

Am I missing something or is everyone else? Why do we care who makes a block chain based service? They'll never come close to the network that has organically sprouted the Bitcoin network...

"Don't tell me what to do, I'm a strong independent currency that don't need no bank." lol
@_date: 2016-07-05 20:00:48
So how does the national currency get transferred? Bank wire? ACH through Bitsquare? Just curious if this is a way to circumvent KYC.
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:33:14
Well I'm not trying to make my video go viral necessarily, I'm saying that it would be cool if we could get the idea to go viral. Videos of people showing what they spend their BTC on. It could possibly further excite people to jump on the band wagon at an increased rate.
I dunno, just an idea. Thanks for the comment.

Thank you for this. I was beginning to question reality for a minute.
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:01:00
$20USD in 1900 would be worth about $1100USD in 2013. So as you can see, gold is a good store of wealth and always has been since the beginning of recorded history.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:31:49
Wait what? How does 1 internets = $0.25? LOL

Looks cool. I signed up for an account and verified it but I can't download the browser here at work. I'll download when I get home.
Are BTC still being sent out for confirmed accounts?
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:34:47
Quick guise!! Chinese mushroom cloud over Europe!! Send all your BTC and LTC to me!
@_date: 2013-12-25 14:42:18
Exactly. And in addition, every time an altcoin is propagated, that's another network infrastructure and that could be huge in the future. I'm thinking these 'coins' are just the beginning of this new form of blockchain information sharing. The applications that can be built to run on these networks in the next stage is going to be mind-boggling. Are these coins like buying shares of the future?
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:58:38
Absolutely spot on.
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:50:29
That awkward moment when you realize that we have one party. Regardless of 'who' controls the media... that entity does not have our best interests in mind.
It's all ratings and mind control maaaaann.
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:51:59
Why the fuck did you make it so difficult? LOL
