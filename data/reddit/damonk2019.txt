Beating the banks again. Bitcoin is ��

Bitcoin the King  of crypto.. itll never die. It's too appealing to traders looking for a profit.
Bull run coming though but expect a pump to around $10,500+/- before it sticks for a while. 
Optimistic outlook $18k before the downward turn but 10.5 to 13.5k I can see it reaching.
Not dead... and even if it were, the bitcoin bandits will pump it back up. Wont lose appeal until the volatility of the market value turns more stable, the profit margins are shortened and it becomes more a stablecoin. Useless to invest in for the profit margins involved...and that wont happen. Ever. ����

Everyone lives BTC. With the potential yields uts a gamblers dream. With depleted markets like now, everyone wants to buy buy buy. As soon as we gain some ground they sell for a small profit. When you mention long term holding no ones interested until they see or read the success stories. 
Gamblers win short term but lose it all long term. Invest and have faith and knowledge in what you hold and it will pay off, if your willing to take the good you must expect the bad so alot of people financially sound are accepting crypto as their pay packets. The Miami Dolphins for one big name, if a medical council decides to use crypto to pay their staff then it could be beneficial for both parties involved. I think more employers and employees should take crypto paychecks.
Classic photo though I love it. Support against oppression is great.

Alot of small miners have given up. I seen a report that the hash rate had dropped substantially given the news of the rewards halving.

Yeah it's totally possible. A big enough account holder could start their own escrow company or even a bank.
Imagine the hedgefund for it lol it could be making millions daily with even the smallest of short day trades ��

Begin the research into the crypto market and buy bitcoin!!
Take trading courses, learn business, build my portfolio and get in on the 2018 pump way heavier than I was lol
If I knew then what I know now, my life would be alot different ����

Yeah I got the same from people years ago when I first got into crypto. Bitcoin was as far as I went then, losing everything I deposited with stupid trades when I knew zero about profiting ����‍♂️. I researched and asked questions, learned through my years of losing everytime and finally hushed my critics and myself when I made a good decision last year, only to make over $13,500 gains which I cashed out, STILL with enough crypto to play with at the prices back then and now, to be fair, I still know zero about trading. That was a lucky one I got by holding and building on my BTC until the right time (in my eyes and it paid off). In reality, I'd bought much more and lost it, before I got this.
Now my trade method is:
• A notepad, pen and the device I'm using at that time.
• I write how much I spend or trade (on GOOD AUTHORITY never more than 10/20% MAX of your total profile), write down beside it the price I got the X crypto locked in at...then when that price goes up satisfying enough, I'll make the trade and sell the amount originally paid. (Not including the transaction fees).
I know that's all wrong, and lower than childs play for pocket money, but it assures me each trade is profitable no matter how little, though if I want to make more I need to give it more attention and make ALOT more of these baby trades.
I have a problem that seems to prevent me from being able to mentally grasp the platforms people usually trade on, with the signal channels etc, up to date graphs.. everything you need to make good yields with your crypto, but I cant work the platforms. Basic as basic goes is hard enough for me so hence the small trades.
I still deposit and buy crypto, but NEVER spend all your money on it nor get into debt over it because the profit making aspect seems to be rapidly declining. It's more these, either government backed stable coins or the actual state coins themselves that the regulators are pushing in to push the crypto we know and love like BTC out of the market, or at least be alot less used.
*personally I believe these stablecoin, with government backing, will offer a swap for other held crypto, meaning the governments would own most of the circulating supply of the market volume on alot of coins, they can either destroy them or play them on markets and gain from them, themselves. 
WHAT THEY WANT IS NO PRIVATELY OWNED STABLECOIN WHICH THEY CANT CONTROL. THEY WANT AND SUPPORT STATE DIGITAL COINS, WHICH THEY CAN CONTROL. Is it a state of panic, so many coins in development and already ready for release like Libra (without all the scrutiny, it is ready to go basically), and GRAM..TON token ��
�� BTC looks to be on a slow decline. It's up and down daily, the Asian market seems to have an impact when it opens for trades but I think it will go up again, if you've got the nerve to hold tight!

My advice was to purchase BTC while it's at a good price to the dollar and hold it, keep it until we see how the markets react to the end of the year Christmas period and the upcoming BTC mining reward halving, usually the value increases but this time I think everyone is unsure how it's going to pan out.
If it's not satisfactory by end of year then I think May or June will see a good rate. 
I guess we'll see lol.

No it's back around the £6,800+ mark now
@_date: 2019-10-17 00:12:45
Just took a bit of a dip but I've been told it was to be expected before a possible rise..
@_date: 2019-10-30 22:29:35
The privately developed stablecoins like Libra will face all the scrutiny though most likely will pass though what the government really want for crypto is a ststecoin, controled and owned by them. Essentially a digital dollar. It will be the same or better security and transparency for a third party to view all your transactions on the blockchain.. just as its recorded now in banks, paypal,  credit cards etc..
@_date: 2019-12-15 16:26:35
Yeah I've my own counter trade set up already. 6800s I can see very soon, its been sideways or no action too long. I did catch the candle today though lol
@_date: 2019-12-19 19:10:25
What does that mean?
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:57:04
5 years is a very long time in crypto land, I could see it possibly higher then 100k.. currently we trade around 10% of that (on a good week) give or take, when BTC takes hold more in other countries and trading is legalized in China, the value will hit Jupiters moons never mind ours lol. The unpredictability and volatility of  is amazing, thats why we all love it. When all these new people are introduced or the trading bans are lifted, youll see a trading volume increase that WILL increase the value most certainly.
@_date: 2019-12-03 00:22:07
\ **WILL** hit 6 figures one day..
Alts and state backed coins are trying to mess with Bitcoin, but its the king and will remain the king. Too many supporters and love for the coin. The only way BTC will go away, is if the governments overload with statecoins or harshly regulated privately developed stablecoins, or institutions HODLing the majority of BTC and the likes, can manipulate the values of decentralized and profitable trading coins. I dont foresee many new crypto millionaires in the future to be honest.
Libra, claiming to be decentralized cant be as its backed with physical assets.. the influence of FB if aligned with the Trump government could be the new market dominance leader if it does launch. From then, all coins will have to follow. So with government intervention in how the coin is valued, how can it be decentralized? Not alot of BTC left to mine but over 1 million held by Coinbase in inactive accounts... those coins should be released back to the market as CB seem to be the leaders in exchanges kissing ass to keep trading. Now ive lost track of what im even talking about so ill end on the note..CRYPTO IS THE FUTURE. BITCOIN WILL NOT DIE EVEN WITH THE RELENTLESS ATTEMPTS OF GOVERNMENT SYMPATHISERS\* WE WILL KEEP IT ALIVE AND GROW IT FURTHER THAN EVER..!! :)

Fiat is basically designed to make people poor over time giving inflation, taxing and in the 100 TRILLION dollar bill in Zimbabwe lol hyperinflation also, it's to control values and with Bitcoin it does not matter as the users of the coin dictate the value. Why else do you think these billionaires and high institutions hold alot of crypto in wallets that have not moved in over a year. I'm talking a balance of 56k BTC in one account which has nit been active in a year or more. Holders, Whales, Hopefuls on mega price rise or government backed or supported mining farms and institutions who have accumulated BTC or hedge funds who trade BTC daily, FOR THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, if these coins began to move it would trigger the volatility on the market again and e would be back to good tradable prices. If they stay still, they are a big part of the market volume traded which in turn determines the S/F volume and again in turn directly affects the value of BTC. FIAT IS BAD. BUY BITCOIN.

No. Go to coinbase and register yourself. Use a different KYC wallet.. I dont use CBpro to trade CB is only a gateway to crypto. Do it yourself but use BTC. This is no good to you if your an Alt fan it's to help rally btc. Nothing else matters though if my link is used the  yes I get $10 when the first $100 is deposited by the account holder. 
What's the problem?.... J suppose in this day and age, j offer a link for simple registration to ONE wallet/crypto app and I'm what...spammers, scammer, robber, hacker...what? WTF can I possibly make it of it whe  I know people dont use referrals they go directly to the said site and register for themselves as i do the exact same myself!!!

They are looking into it. Its not YouTube it must be a third party abusing YouTube's reporting function. Possibly... have Libra content been affected?
