There are tons of "fly by night" web hosts out there, so be careful if you'd looking to have something reliable. Amazon AWS is king, but far too expensive. In my years of development I've found that the two next best hosts are [Linode]( and [DigitalOcean](
[DigitalOcean]( Get a cheap $20/month 2GB RAM/2CPU/40GB HDD plan and add an extra storage volume to it. For the entire blockchain, you'll need about ~90GB. I suggest creating a volume with 100GB. You're basically in for $30 a month.
I personally use [Linode]( and they're excellent, but their disk sizes are fixed. You would need their 12GB RAM plan for 192 GB SSD, since their 8GB plan only includes 96GB, which is barely enough for the blockchain and system OS.

While I don't recommend ever doing this. technically the entire request of an HTTPS session is secured by TLS. The connection is negotiated first, and then and only then, are the query string and header values sent. They would not be exposed to any network sniffing attacks, but they would be stored in the browser history, and obviously visible in cleartext to the user on that machine.
Using a POST request and including details in the payload is generally a better idea for login forms. Even then, usually passwords are not hashed client-side, they are hashed server-side. The next time you go to login to something, open up dev tools and inspect the request for yourself.

Is that really cheating though? It's an open decentralized network. If the network allows it, it's fair game IMO.

You should have sever-side logic that creates signatures and policies. These get passed onto the user, so they can upload files to your bucket in an authenticated manner.
If I upload a 5GB file to your bucket right now and have a 70,000 member botnet download it, you're going to get hit with some pretty significant bandwidth charges. S3 isn't just an open dump, so you shouldn't treat it like one.

I think you're missing the point. You should *NEVER* expose your AWS secret keys. Never. It wouldn't surprise me if you have a bunch of bots spinning up EC2 instances on your AWS account very soon. They scan GitHub regularly and it only takes them milliseconds to find these. These keys are now in my post above, and 2 forks, so I suggest deleting them and re-creating.

I believe many try to steer users away from p2pool.org because it was functioning as a private pool for a while, but claiming they were using P2Pool on the backend. I believe they have switched since then, however they are now charging a 2% fee.
Running your own P2Pool node locally is an even better solution, and makes things even more decentralized. However, many people don't have the resources to leave their computer on 24/7 and store the entire blockchain (20+ GB). The machine also needs to be stable with low latency.

He posted up on Craigslist in the Colorado section with pictures of a Jupiter taken in East Longmeadow, MA, claiming to be from Boulder, and asking me to "send BTC first". I of course did not fall for this tactic, as I've had my fair share of 419eater posts. The exact same ad and pictures were posted in almost every major US city on Craigslist.
The damn guy sent me pictures of miners with GPS coordinates in the EXIF data and still tried to lie about it!

It is important! Technically speaking, there are already public P2Pool nodes that anyone can join. Many of them however often suffer downtime, and if one of those were to receive a lot of traffic, they could go down too as there is no redundancy.
I have decided to operate several P2Pool nodes and cluster them together with load balancers. If one server goes down, your mining client will simply switch to another server, which the load balancer will automatically redirect you to.
As of now, I'm offering this service for free with **ZERO** fee's. In the future, I might add a fee to cover hosting costs, but it will be very minimal. (think 0.25%)
To connect, point your miner to: p2pool.io, port 9332, and set the username as your Bitcoin address to receive payouts. You can use any password.

Try giving the daemon a workout by actually making RPC calls to it, and the memory usage will shoot up quite a bit. This is practically all that happens when mining via p2pool.

I just came home from a week in Aruba today! I wish I knew about you guys - I would have totally stopped by and paid with BTC!
@_date: 2014-01-30 15:15:48
Yes, they can. Though 30 GH/s is just on the border in my opinion. P2Pool uses PPLNS as a payment system - so it could take up to 48-72 hours to actually start receiving payouts. On lower hashrate miners, this is completely normal.
@_date: 2014-01-08 20:32:11
There are some public P2Pool nodes, however I notice that very often some of them are down. What if someone setup a giant cluster of P2Pool nodes using EC2 instances with load balancing in different zones - similar to how BTCGuild works. A miner could then connect to p2pool.domain.com and would be directed to an available server. BTCGuild by example has a ton of servers on their backend (some of which are private), and this is one of the reasons why they have some of the best uptime out of any pool.
Miners wont have to worry about setting up their own P2Pool. While it would be nice for something like this to be completely free - I don't think it's possible. However getting by with charging 0.5% or 0.25% fee's is doable I think.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:58:51
Join p2pool.io! 
In my experience many of the existing public P2Pool nodes will often suffer downtime. These nodes are not running any type of redundancy, so the net result is your miner stops only because you're connected to that 1 person's IP address. Sure, you could have a backup pool set, but who wants to bother with a giant list of IP addresses? I've decided to solve this problem by starting p2pool.io.
I have setup a cluster of P2Pool instances which are all load balanced. You simply setup your miner to point to one domain name, one port, and you use your Bitcoin address as your username. Any password will work. Just like P2Pool, payouts are using PPLNS so it will take a little bit for things to ramp up, but mining will start instantly!

DOA is exactly what it sounds like. All mining pools have DOA shares - this is very common.

That's easy!
I run AntMiner S1's myself. Here's how to configure them to point against p2pool.io:
**Server:** stratum+tcp://p2pool.io:9332  
**Username:** your_BTC_address_here/0+220.4  
**Password:** 123
Notice how I've added on "/0+220.4" to the end of your username. This is specifically optimized for an AntMiner S1 and sets your share and pseudo share difficulty.

@_date: 2014-06-14 03:48:48
I suppose if one had bad intentions, they could try something negative. However there are several websites where you can verify the hashrate of a specific P2Pool address for verification.
If you have the resources and can invest the time, I always suggest setting up your own local instance of P2Pool. However most people don't have an extra machine they can leave running 24/7, so "public" P2Pool nodes are very popular nowadays.

P2Pool is about decentralization. Slush's pool is operated by one person - Slush. He holds the reigns and makes the decisions for what the pool does. With P2Pool, there is no single person in charge. It's a bunch of nodes all talking to each other and collectively acting as a pool together.
For example, GHash.io is at risk of a 51% attack. This means the pool could do bad things, and this is only because someone is in charge of the pool - the owners. With P2Pool, things are decentralized, and there is no owner.
@_date: 2014-01-19 06:09:37
Compared to non-P2Pool-based pools, I'd say difficulty. By design, P2Pool share difficulty is higher. This makes finding a valid share more challenging for lower hashrate miners. However P2Pool also pays out all transaction fee's - something which many pools don't do.

This looks very interesting and I think you're definitely heading down the correct road with the multi-signature idea. However, the entire point of Bitcoin is to create transactions without having to trust a 3rd party and this kinda defeats that purpose. People need to trust your service to sign transactions. If you were to suddenly vanish like Mt. Gox did for example, then everyone using 2 of 2 addresses would loose their money. Sure, you can't "steal" people's coins, but if you vanish suddenly, people would require one of *your* keys to sign a transaction. (2 of 2) "For all other 2-of-2 policies we will simply publish our associated private keys." Do you really expect us to believe you will furnish this information when you close down? I can't remember the last time an entity made a promise such as this and actually followed through when they were closing down.
You can easily remedy part of this by removing the offering of 2 of 2 policies.

Guys - p2pool.org is perfectly legit. It's simply a public P2Pool node.
However, the real reason why you shouldn't be mining there is their 2% fee: 
$ curl 
I suggest joining us at [p2pool.io]( instead, a zero fee, load-balanced P2Pool cluster.
@_date: 2014-06-18 02:21:45
I would not mine on any P2Pool node with that hash rate due to P2Pool's higher share difficulty. You'll make better returns on a "normal" pool.
@_date: 2014-05-14 16:46:08
They can't steal per-se - but they could invalidate previous transactions and thus make your coins disappear. This would in turn make your Bitcoin node completely useless.

Not at all. Check the stats of any other popular public P2Pool node out there.
Keep in mind that it's in the miner's best interest to mine on a public P2Pool node that has the lowest latency given their location. If a miner from Europe wants to mine on a USA-based pool, I can't stop them. It only hurts their own shares/returns.

Port 80 of p2pool.io is running a custom API that I wrote. Since I have multiple P2Pool nodes load-balanced for redundancy, I need to collect individual results from each node and combine them. I only wrote API's for the stats that I actually use/display on the homepage. What you see on the homepage of p2pool.io represents the stats for the entire cluster.
You can access the fee API using port 9332:  However this will only return the fee for the specific node you have been redirected to. I can write a fee API later on, but I can assure you they are all zero - thus I don't see the point.
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:03:04
Based on my experience mining altcoins with P2Pool using multiple BFL ASIC's, this is not true. Perhaps there are a few rejects for the first minute or so - but I believe this is typical for any hardware on P2Pool.

It depends on your view. All nodes are part of the same network, and there are some easy ways to prove legitimacy. For example, if you mined with [p2pool.io]( there is no reason why you couldn't look up your address hashrate on [p2pool.info]( to verify shares are coming through.
@_date: 2014-01-30 19:13:33
This is precisely why lower hashrate miners are not recommended to use P2Pool, as I stated above. :)

Let's say you have some cash in your real physical wallet. Would you let your friend hold it for you? If yes, you should use Coinbase.
In my opinion, holding funds at Coinbase is a poor idea. While it's unlikely right now, if they were to go down, or even bust, you would have a hard time accessing your own funds. With Coinbase you have don't have any ownership of private keys, thus you technically don't have full control of any coins either. All you're left with is a bunch of IOU's.
Do I think they're a great service for buying coins? Absolutely! But don't store your coins there.

No, the coins belong to Coinbase. In crypto, you must retain ownership of your private keys in order to truly "own" coins.

If you ever sell that crypto, you must establish your cost basis because it is a capital gain (assuming you didn't sell at a loss).
Your cost basis is determined to be the price of the coin when you received it. If you receive said rewards on every swipe, you're going to have a massive amount of entries on your taxes.
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:09:54
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:47:43
Monthly sounds right and would greatly simplify things.


Yes, it absolutely does matter. When you receive it, you do not have to pay taxes, that is correct. But now that you own it, if you ever go to *sell* that crypto, then you must pay taxes on it. And to calculate those taxes correctly, (and in your best interest) you must know the value/price of the coin on the date you first received it. Otherwise, you would potentially overpay in taxes.
It doesn't matter if you got the crypto as a card reward or from Grandma for Christmas, you still have to pay taxes on it when it's sold.
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:12:41
An airline flight/credit card points are not taxable. Crypto, once it's sold, is. There is a clear difference.

You should always file losses, because you can use them to offset gains, even in future years with a carryover.
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:28:10
Yes, the previous post is my opinion after performing an immense amount of research. It's also almost exactly what every single article or blog post out there suggests as well.
1. There was already a futures market present for the forked coin - thus it is relatively simple to establish fair market value at the time of the fork. These are the prices I referenced.
2. As I stated previously, once you have access to them, you now have an accession to wealth. That would've been August 1st if you held your own private keys. If you held coins on an exchange (terrible idea) then you would push that date until the day the exchange makes them available to you. That wasn't until December for Coinbase folks.
3. It's clear which coin is the fork - let's not get it twisted and drag FUD into this. On August 1st, one coin maintained thousands of dollars worth of value, and the newly forked coin was worth $266.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:39:11
No, not at all. If you're on an exchange, you either sent them 2 coins as a deposit, or brought 2 coins and hold a balance of 2 coins. You shouldn't expect anything other than 2 coins.
Something coming "for free" out of thin air is merely a perk that one is entitled to by managing their own keys.
If you hold stock with a brokerage firm and someone creates a copy of that stock, you don't get that for free. If the stock you hold paid dividends, you would receive them, but they would be dividends of that same stock you hold. (not from another stock, or in this case, another chain)

Check out [Linode]( I use them for many things, and they are more generous than DigitalOcean in terms of CPU cores and HDD space. (All of which are SSD based) Their 8GB RAM/$80 per month Linode fits the blockchain quite nicely with 192 GB SSD. The 4GB plan gives you 96GB, but that's unfortunately not enough if you have txindex turned on, have the full blockchain downloaded, and have parsed index records from whatever blockchain explorer app you will be running. Insight from BitPay right now comes in at about ~105GB last time I checked, and Toshi from Coinbase is much larger @ ~200+ GB.
@_date: 2015-11-23 17:53:45
Just as a heads up - I have run blockparser on a few of my servers with 8GB RAM. You will need some serious RAM for it to complete tasks in a timely manner, as in ~20+ GB RAM. I didn't want to pay for that large of a instance, so I created a 25GB swap file on an 8GB Linode instance, kicked off my task in a screen session, disconnected, and came back the next morning.
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:14:39
It's no different than any other type of property that has been received which has value. Coins that you magically received out of thin air due to a fork typically need to be declared as income for the tax year in which you received them. Once you have access to them, you now have an accession to wealth. To calculate this income, simply take the number of coins you now have access to, and multiply it by that day's fair market price. It's well known that when the Bitcoin fork happened this past summer on August 1st, the fair market price was $266/$277. (depending where you check)
Now, it's unreasonable for someone to keep track of and report taxes on every single forked coin they may or may not have access to. Especially if they don't agree with the fork - and never use/touch those forked coins. In the event that you don't file income taxes on them, that is OK. However, if you ever go to spend them one year later, you must declare your cost basis as zero. This means capital gains tax is applied against 100% of the value.

My opinion:
You really have two options. If you sell the BCH, you can claim a cost basis of zero, but then 100% of the gain is taxable.
Alternatively, you can claim the BCH as income @ $266 per coin on August 1st. After that, If you ever go to sell BCH, your cost basis is now $266. IMO airdrop coins technically are income because you now have an "accession to wealth".
Another good example for the zero argument is a second generation farm animal. You own a cow, the cow has a baby. As a farmer, that baby is worth *something*, but not until you sell it one day. In this case, you'd likely put your cost basis as zero.

Let's get real for a second. You have no evidence, all logs were perfectly cleaned, and you used one of the most insecure online wallets? Your computer was never hacked. You likely got scammed somehow and the hackers stole your wallet directly from Blockchain.info.

In 2011 he most likely downloaded Bitcoin Core. If he wiped his machine since then, then he's unfortunately out of luck. Any chance he took backups? (CrashPlan, Time Machine, etc)

Download Breadwallet from the app store. Whatever you do, don't give anyone that private key, regardless of how much they're willing to "help" you.
@_date: 2016-05-20 16:31:43
Just wait it out. It will arrive soon. Make sure to backup your wallet.dat file and store it in a safe place! Also, enable encryption in Bitcoin Core so you are forced type in a password to send coins. This way if someone steals your wallet.dat file (many viruses do) then your coins are "safe" with another layer of protection. (password needed to decrypt)
@_date: 2018-04-16 16:25:46
My opinion: Your "accession to wealth" likely occurred on August 1st, or whenever you first had access to the coins.

It's simple: You don't own/control/possess the private keys. If you don't have the private keys, you don't have anything except for an IOU.
Another example: If Coinbase goes down (happens often) or gets shut down, you are SOL.

That is a 2016, which has a base price of $65,700. He clearly has a carbon fiber rear deck lip, carbon fiber rear valence, and rear parking sensors, all of which can be ordered on this car. Given those options, he's clearly a car enthusiast (most M owners are), so I'm going to guess he at least got the 19" OEM wheels as well. This car is easily $75k+.

I didn't read the entire paper in full detail, but I skimmed it.
On a similar note, I've been contemplating launching BaaS, or Blockchain as a Service. This would be an on-demand fully synced bitcoind instance that a user could SSH into and/or access remotely for their own private apps.

While this may make sense from a security perspective, the reality is stringent approaches like this are what is responsible for the lack of mass cryptocurrency adoption. The masses haven't adopted it unless grandma can easily use it.

Come forward? Just search reddit and you'll find me. After all, I introduced the site on reddit [here in :)
[bitmsg.me]( is a side project of mine that was created purely during my free time for fun. As I stated in the introduction thread - I'm sure there are plenty of bugs, but I felt it was ready for live traffic. My motivation for creating the site was to provide an intuitive user experience that made bitmessage easy to use. The alternative is using git to checkout the reference app repo, downloading (and potentially compiling) python, and then running the python application/script. In my opinion an everyday user doesn't know how to do all of that - and this is where [bitmsg.me]( comes into play.
Obviously security is very important. I have taken some precautions to address this but the site is only a minimum viable product at this point (MVP). Several features still need to be added such as client side PoW. I'm currently working on porting this to Javascript, but it's turned out to be a bit trickier than I thought. However I believe that it CAN be done, it's just matter of my free time.
A simple example would be SSL. When I first launched the site I had no idea if anyone was going to use something like this. I already had infrastructure resources in place, but I had no dire need to run out and drop $60 on an SSL certificate. Over the last month I've had time to watch usage stats of the site and I can assure you people are using it - quite a bit in fact - so you can expect SSL to come very soon. :)
At this point I have not open sourced anything, and I'm not sure if I'm going to or not. If I did, then what is to stop others from launching their own sites using my code? Eventually I'd like to create mobile apps as well for iOS and Android. Deterministic address support should be coming soon as well - allowing users to use [bitmsg.me]( without needing to sign up - just enter a passphrase and you're off!
@_date: 2016-07-08 16:23:17
No it's not. You're buying a well-engineered German luxury sports car. Some people like to track their cars. Some like to drive on back roads in a spirited manner. If you buy a BMW, you're paying for the quality and engineering. If you slap a BMW logo on a Honda, it's still a Honda, but with a BMW sticker on it. The difference in engineering and dynamics has not changed.
That's like someone saying to you: "Buying a fast hard drive is just so dumb"
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:10:33
There is tons of crap like this on Bitcointalk, it's ridiculous. While it definitely sucks, you have no one to blame but yourself.  
Let me ask you this: Would you have sent cash in an envelope to these people if you weren't using Bitcoin?

Great site, very cool idea!
Have you looked into Bitmessage at all? It's basically P2P encrypted messaging which is modeled off of Bitcoin. I created [bitmsg.me]( to help bring that experience into a web application.

Hello reddit!  
A few weeks ago I thought it would be fun to create a web application based on Bitmessage. Part of my inspiration for this was Blockchain.info. I like how they have created a browser interface for a Bitcoin wallet, and I thought it would be a great idea to do the same, but for Bitmessage.  
Today I'm happy to present you with bitmsg.me - A new way to send Bitmessages from a web browser.  
Let me be very clear: This is a side project of mine that was created purely during my free time for fun. Yes, I'm sure there are bugs. However, I felt the codebase was ready enough for live traffic. The site is still in the Beta phase, and any and all feedback is much appreciated. (negative/positive/suggestions/whatever)  
With that said, if you think Bitmessage is as cool as I do, I hope you will spend a few short moments and give the site a quick try.  
Thanks,  
@_date: 2013-07-31 17:24:16
I haven't used LocalBitcoins before. But reading between the lines:
Escrow should not be turned on for local transactions according to LocalBitcoins. You just so happened to delete the text messages. Why? I think any normal person would leave them in tact, especially if they knew they were about to file a dispute. You also denied to provide an ID, and you turned on escrow for someone who you were about to meet in person, face to face. Why would you even do that?
You then go on and refuse to provide any proof, and you're trying to publicly shame LocalBitcoins into making a fast decision in your favor.
Sounds like you're the scammer.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:56:14
Is this stuff any good? I received a bottle of this as a gift some time ago. It's been on my counter for 6 months and is now room temp. Should I try it? (Though the person who gave it to me probably had it for 1 year before giving it to me)
@_date: 2013-07-02 03:16:31
Thanks for the link! I think I might have tried these certs a *long* time ago, but back then only certain browsers supported them.
I will look into setting this up!
@_date: 2013-08-12 19:29:44
It has not been abandoned. I'm working on it during my free time, and SSL support should be coming within the next few days. I was mostly waiting for some usage stats to determine if buying an SSL certificate was worth it or not.
My initial thought at launch was "Why should I spend $60 on an SSL certificate if no one is going to use the site?". Well (fortunately), I was proven wrong and people are using the site quite a bit - so SSL is coming very soon. :)
@_date: 2013-07-04 22:43:32
This site looks great Perhaps I missed it, but do you guys have a business model that generates revenue? (or plan to)  
@_date: 2013-07-02 03:22:15
PoW is currently handled on the server side.
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:04:52
Agreed. Assuming you follow a pattern such as this, Brainwallets are a great idea. You could travel the entire world and be completely naked, leaving nothing behind - yet you'd still have BTC to your name.
That my friends, is a beautiful thing.

I had a similar issue. It took me 4-5 attempts to pass their verification. I know how long I've truly lived at my current address, but apparently Coinbase's source for questions doesn't. I had to select an incorrect answer in order for it to pass.
Maybe try guessing wrong on a question or two?
@_date: 2013-07-02 03:09:49
This is a known bug. Thank you for pointing it out though!
As an FYI - this site only supports sending to Bitmessage addresses.
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:13:26
7 BTC? Ha! I spent *hundreds* of BTC on (4) BFL 60 GH/s Singles when they were first announced. Wiring money to a sketchy company seemed a bit "too real" at the time, so I figured why not send them some $12 coins. Then again, all those coins were from mining profits so I really considered it to be "house money". It sucks for sure, but I consider it to be one of those life experiences.

Hello reddit!
A few months back I shared my latest project with you - bitmsg.me. In my free time I've continued development of the site and have added several new features. During this time I have also received all types of feedback which has been invaluable. Thank you to those of you who shared your thoughts.
Most recently I have finally added deterministic address support. Users who have accounts now have the option of generating a random address, or a deterministic address using a passphrase. I have also added SSL support (by default), deletion of sent messages, UI changes, and fixed several bugs. Remember, this site is only in Beta and will continue to be for a long time.
With that said, I'm happy to report that user feedback overall has been very positive. To make things even cooler - I've received a large portion of this feedback via Bitmessage itself! Everyday users are finally starting to see the value in this type of application/protocol, and I think it's great. I'm happy to share with you that over 600 users have registered on the site, and well over 1,000 messages have been sent.
I have also setup a Twitter handle ([ and Bitcoin donation address. (1KU3Zqzjug2pyn6bkJzsUBkYjxL21GznkR) As always, you can find several ways to communicate with us [here]( and please feel free to share any feedback you may have!
Thanks,

While it appears that the OP was in fact using a brain wallet - there is nothing wrong with Brainwallets themselves **if you choose a secure passphrase with high entropy.**
The OP could have used a vanity or randomly generated address on  and still had the same problem.
**People need to stop blaming brain wallets and blame  or someone else instead**

1. Setup an EC2/Linode/DigitalOcean cloud VPS.
2. Get free SSL cert from StartSSL
4. Create a free Google Apps account for your domain, change your DNS MX records.
5. ??
6. Profit. Your app is now hosted, with root access and more control, for less than $20 a month.
@_date: 2013-07-01 23:21:56
I would certainly like to. I have decided to wait for the time being. The last thing I want to do is drop $50-$100 on an SSL cert and have the site be a total flop. If it gains some decent traction (which it already has in the past ~24 hours) then I will happily setup SSL.
