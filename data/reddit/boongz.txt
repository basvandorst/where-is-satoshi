You are correct about the manipulation-link, sorry about that, read that wrong.   
But saying you buy the dip when the price is 8000, is basicly a statement that you think it will go up thereafter. If you would take a look at the charts, this dip is nothing compared to the rally which has been without any real pullback. History-wise similar parabolic rallies has had a weekly candle with -40% correction, so congratulating yourself after buying a -10% in a +160-180% rally is just asking to lose money.   
Therefor I was just asking if you had any explanation to why this would be a wise choice. I, however regret writing my last comment (and this one), because not educating yourself in the markets and being greedy is your own doing. It's just itches me to sometimes try to understand the thought process behind the decision(s).   
Won't respond any further, wish you good luck.

You clearly don't understand how this works
@_date: 2019-06-04 11:31:43
Can you please try to explain why you are so confident the dip ends at 8000?It makes no sense taken into consideration the parabolic rally without any pullbacks. I am somewhat feeling bad for people like you, and also the people cheering you on and doing the same, but I really shouldn't. You are not acting rational, but out of greed. You even link to a speculative thread about the dump and using words as "verifying the manipulation", why would this be any verification at all? You are looking for proof for your own bias. I shouldn't   
even bother writing this, it's always the same. Good luck.

Who cares? I wrote it on 10 seconds and didn’t look twice.
Yes, you are the dumbass to think Coinbase-crash made it drop. It is extremly overbought, this 2000$ drop was nothing. You can be glad it stopped there, the upwards trend might continue, who knows. But you and other circle-jerkers who refuse to be rational are just insane or blinded by greed.

Dude... you’re an asshole. 
Being rude like that over 18$ and 30 minutes of actually getting replies back. If there’s a technical issue why do you expect them to have answers right away? And why does the thread say withdraw when you are asking about staking?
30 min of being rude + creating Reddit thread over 18$, dear god...

The cold hard truth is all there is left, and that’s what I gave you, there is noone here who can magically make you un-scammed. 
You can call it desperation if you want, but I would still call it greed &amp; stupidity combined. 
@_date: 2019-04-01 01:53:59
I am sorry to say this, but - everything you did sounds fueled by greed and stupidity. 
You deposit basicly everything you have to make a small profit (or if the price difference is insane thats just another huge red flag).
You didn’t seem to do any research before commiting your money (and it takes you 2 seconds to find out using Google, f’ck sake).
Crypto is highly speculative, and you gamble with money you seem to need for rent (����‍♂️����‍♂️����‍♂️)
Sorry but you should learn from this and try to grow up and make wiser decisions in the future.

A little too bullish right now, yes
@_date: 2019-05-22 21:45:55
Sudden volatility....?

My friend talked to me about Revolut, so I was going to try it out. But when I had the card &amp; app I simply couldn’t see anything that said they were actually using the blockchain. No public keys to deposit etc. There was only direct fiat to crypto, with no proof of anything. I told my friend that he shouldn’t buy any crypto there because it would only be on ”paper”, or whatever word to use. With a public key atleast you could confirm your address was holding the crypto (and yeah I know they would probably still have the private key). So basicly they are just ”pretending” to use crypto, so I am not surprised this happend. Good luck!

Why would I be angry? Makes no sense again
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:29:57
It has gone from 4000 up to 8350 and you are confused when it goes down hundreds? I hope you’re not a daytrader.

Binance messing around with their Tether just a few days ago, and now 7000 BTC gone in one transaction? Yeah right, sounds shady AF.
