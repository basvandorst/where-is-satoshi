I guess context is missing.  This is all the bitcoin I mined back in 2013 because I thought it was interesting technology and wanted to see how it worked.  I stopped mining after a few days as I shared an electric bill with my roommates.  I found my old harddrive and remembered that my wallet.dat was on it and decided to retrieve it off of the harddrive, and then thought it would be cool to turn the bitcoin i "mined" into an actual coin, and it would be a coin that I mined.  Due to bitpay's cut and transfer fees, I do not think that I will be able to do this anymore.  It really just annoys me though, that they still have half of all the bitcoin that I mined, mostly due to their slow response times during a time while the price of bitcoin was doubling.

That makes sense, but it was more of a void sale, not a refund.  Nothing was shipped nor returned.  The time period from purchase to them refunding me the bitcoin should have been 6 business days considering they say their processing time is 2-3 days, but this took a month and a half due to lack of response on their part.  This is what makes me feel like I was essentially scammed.  That and the complete lack of information of FinCEN and why the purchase was flagged, even after I asked for this information specifically.  I feel like they could have just sat on their hands and waited to see if the price of bitcoin would go up, and then just falsely claim that the purchase was flagged, so they could profit off of the exchange rate changes.
