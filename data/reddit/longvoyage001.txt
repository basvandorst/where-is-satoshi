If compares to tulip bubble, we all know where it ends.
If compares to dotcom "bubble" around 1999/2000, there were two kinds of result.  there was Novell (&amp; others) and there was Amazon (&amp; others), the chart looks very similar if we comparing 1999/2000(dotcom stocks) to 2017/2018(Bitcoin). 
we really just don't know which way bitcoin will go .  it could be amazon , it could be Novell. it also could be RIM black berry though, aha, this is the third possibility.

well, those stocks were also generating Negative numbers of cash from operations in certain period.
when considering the values of software business or internet service business, it really depend on the usage case , but the value is not always(most of time it's not) connect to their stock price.  there are also demand aspect, think about diamond, it's worth nothing until people wants it because some dude promote it properly , if you just consider physical value of natural diamond to man-made diamond, there is really not much difference, but the price difference is so big. 
All that I'm saying is that it's not that simple trying to judge value of certain things, don't just look at chart, says it's bubble (or not). or just because you can or cannot hold it in you hand.

I mean it,  there are time you can tell up or down though, maybe only for few hours or a day, maybe just 90%.
moment like this, nobody can tell.  doesn't matter how fancy those TA graphic looks

I don't think anybody can tell it's up to 7000 or down to 6000
