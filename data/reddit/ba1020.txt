well they wanted to be exposed to BTC on a regulated Exchange, they never wanted to buy nor own Bitcoin nor manage keys...
these ETF will have to pay out their earnings in Bitcoin and that means more and more Investors lose the fear of Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-18 11:34:48
while Europe is trading ETF Murica still playing with glas marbles
@_date: 2018-11-27 13:45:13
when Investors invest 100M in this fund , the Fund has to go on the market and buy 100M worth of Bitcoin
so when there is suddenly a huge buyer in Bitcoin than think again what would happen to the price
@_date: 2018-11-16 17:03:40
they also take Btrash ! that means they got no clue
@_date: 2019-01-27 20:05:08

@_date: 2011-12-06 10:12:58
Bitcoins are very cool despite their price
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:13:20
