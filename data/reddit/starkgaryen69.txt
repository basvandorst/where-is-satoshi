I think the ultimate thing would be if we could get a good series of huge lightning nodes show their incoming and outgoing transactions in some kind of website and then try to extrapolate that number to estimate the amount of transactions bitcoin does on LN. Especially when the next bull market comes, the infrastructure for Lightning will be epic. Noobs will be able to easily use lightning. The TPS of bitcoin will be off the charts and all the altcoins will suck humongous cocks, choke on em and die, like bcash.  
I'll see myself out.
@_date: 2019-02-10 14:45:33

History has taught us that EVERYONE underestimated the bull market top BEFORE the bull market started (During the bull market everyone was obviously overestimating it from 50-250k). This time around will be exactly the same. Near the top liquidity gets so ample that the top might be between 120k-200k. Its just impossible to say. But 100k should be do-able after the next halving.

Yes, and a block halving suddenly squeezes the supply, therefore the price is indirectly connected to the protocol.

If this bear market lasts 6 more months, bitmain is straight bankrupt, even before 6 months I think.
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:49:42
I get your point. So that means that every block halving, that amount halvens at the same price? So next blockhalving it will be 2.5M per day and 2024 halving it will be 1.25M per day.
Furthermore, if the institutional investors can buy a piece, these couple of millions per day will be small blip in the BTC ecosystem.
I do agree this bull market was wild, so the hangover might be heavier (multi year bear market? At least till the next halving).
I am not worried at all, not even the tiniest bit. 
Im sad I dont have shitloads of fiat to dump into BTC now.
@_date: 2019-01-16 22:12:19

Furthermore, the halving of coins on the market constantly by miners should also be taken into consideration.
I like the state of crypto right now. People are more focused on development etc.

Bcash is the king of shitcoins. It will die sooner or later.
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:38:07
Did you seriously reduce your bitcoin exposure ONE YEAR BEFORE A HALVING? 
Lmao, the amount of retards in this space keeps astonishing me.
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:36:45
It seems you do not understand bitcoin. Go read a book and come back and feel free to ask me how you can buy some. ;)

By the end of the week you mean.
Oh wait...
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:29:56
Sure, compare bitcoin with steamtrains. Moron.
@_date: 2018-12-14 12:12:28
The fact that bitcoin will not go away and cannot be stopped is already an extremely bullish sign. Now all you need is time to do the work.

Does andreas have a video where he explains how a deflationary asset like bitcoin will stimulate spending in an all-bitcoin economy?
