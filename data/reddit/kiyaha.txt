Exactly what happening here
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:13:00
How did they practically do it? 
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:13:01
In Ukraine the name is "horilka", but the content is the same:)

@_date: 2014-02-27 23:07:25
That's not true. My word against yours.
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:00:32
True. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:06:27
What'd you like to know?
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:26:20
@_date: 2014-02-28 10:55:43
Hopefully, that won't happen. Could have had with the previous one:)

Money go to the need of protesters. Before the President was overthrown, it went to buy food, medicine, equipment (tents, fridges for medicine, for petrol for volunteers' cars to bring goods, for network equipment to setup wi-fi access points in the protesters' camps, etc.) 
Even when President is hiding now, people stay in Kyiv to make sure Ukraine goes through the transformation and does achieve all good things people were standing for. As soon as people are gone from the streets, politicians will start playing their dirty games once again.
So as people stay on the streets, they would need support. That's what me, Nastya and lots of people are doing.
@_date: 2014-02-28 10:53:17
Not those BTC, for sure.
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:02:56
U did. Thanks!

If people are fighting against corruption and for the better state, they are manipulated by US interest? 
Never felt it on me, neither didn't my friends and relative. 
May be, it exists. If it brings a better living for Ukrainians, then US interest is going well along with mine.
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:48:15
Which policy? Do you have the copy? Video proofs? 
It's not up to you to say if they have a government or not. US, EU recognizes it, no other country says they don't. Russia doubts, but they are the ones throwing troops to an independent country.
Happy for you that you have found what you believe it. Wish you had more hard facts to prove it.

I've EU bank account, traded BTC to USD at Bitstamp and sent SEPA to EU account. Once it's on EU account, there systems and way to sent it to UA which are mentioned in the article.
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:29:15
You can find lots of videos saying one or the other thing. Yes, economic situation is shit, but that's not what people were standing for. Unfortunately, Ukraine is of a very geopolitical interest for Russian and EU (and US because they care about everyone), so you can't but expect them playing their games. But that doesn't mean people can't go to the streets and protest for the better life, to end the corruption and hope for the better.
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:09:38
All the money were sent to Bitstamp addresses to deposit BTC there. First 2000 then 1.4k more. I trade them there for USD and withdraw them then.

Move was retarded, I agree. But on the ground it means really nothing if you know the reality.
Schools are in Russian in Eastern Ukraine, people speak the language too. I've relatives and friends in Eastern Ukraine and Crime. Noone forces them not to use Russian. Actually, it's opposite, you would rarely find a school with Ukrainian language there.
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:20:20
It's two of us organising, Nastya and me (Viktor), see the article. Keepsliding is Nastya's account.
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:05:54
Mentioned it above, it goes for lots of small initiatives organised by a large group of volunteers (buying supplies for the protesters who still remain on the streets - water, food, equipment for the tents, medicine, fridges to store it, clothes, petrol for transporting good or people, etc.).
We'll post more here.
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:29:48
Thanks, cheers!
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:11:39
I know which people are standing for what. As those are all my closest friends, their friends, relatives. Noone of them was paid, at least on antigovernment protests. 
It wasn't there before as students were not beaten before, because people were not put in jail for driving a car in a group of more than 5 vehicles, because noone was put into jail for beating those people.
In any case, you can doubt my words, your right. Mine - to help people and support them in their struggle for the better country via Bitcoin or any other source.
@_date: 2014-02-28 10:59:29
It's mentioned in article and I've mentioned above. I've EU bank account. There's always a way to transfer the money if you have them.
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:23:02
Some ganges may be do, so far haven't seen that in the news. After revolution won and system collapsed the things are possible. But to tell that's all protesters?  Millions were out on the streets, if they were looting, you wouldn't definitely see that in the news. Pretty lots of mass media in Ukraine now.
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:04:31
There aren't perfect government. And they are not anti Russian. If Russia would keep from making all the political maneuvers and actually military forces movement in Crimea, then rhetoric would be different. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:55:52
Out of all people on Maidan, didn't see any. But, may be, somewhere they are. Money will definitely not go to them.
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:17:52
Who they are then?
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:15:07
That's the plan, not targeting 1-2 people, the ones heavily woulded or who lost someone already getting lost of help, but rather help many with little (water supplies, food, equipment, etc.)
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:59:46
You may realise, but I can assure that has nothing to do with the reality.
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:23:25
No, we don't.
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:05:54
QR belongs to my account. I've posted the link to my FB and Linkedin profiles. No scam here guys.
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:26:13
Use QR reader app in any OS store

I've started to get donations yesterday. Today I've withdrawn to my account. Won't wait till they come, but send my own funds today to Ukraine. So it's 1-2 max days till the money will be in Ukraine.
Paypal is similar to that, it takes 1-2 days to get it to EU account as well. Same as Bitstamp. No real difference.
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:24:12
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:16:49
From all the people all Maidan, don't know about anyone paid... Now, revolution have won, people still stay. Are they paid? Wish so...
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:18:57
Guys, I do own account of BC. Here's my FC account: 
Here's my Linkedin one: cz.linkedin.com/in/kiyashko/
Can assure money goes for what it's being raised for. We'll post more info here
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:01:49
Yes, we'll post an update here.
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:12:13
No, it doesn't. All was peaceful and fine for 2 months and peaceful protests are definitely not against the law. That was before government started to shoot its people. Then when it's started to call "revolution" which it turned out to be.
Velvet revolution in CZ or Revolution of Roses in Georgian were not against the law.
