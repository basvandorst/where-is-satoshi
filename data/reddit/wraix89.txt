Yeah it is so great.. I think u damaged your head?

Its not wasteful... If we take a look at our current situation for example in Germany, we have problems to use the oversupply of energy...
We cannot controll renewable energy plants, so we need plants with a basic load.. Cutting them all of is stupid.. 
If we use bitcoin farms as negativ benefit and use mining farms in time when we have an overdemand, we are good! (Just in Theory)
Its the same like using Power-to-Gas for storing energy..

If we use the mining farms efficient with renewable energy we are not wasting any energy..
In Germany for example we have to shut down wind plants, because the grid is local overloaded even if we can produce energy.. If we implement a bitcoin farm to use this we can create new businesses...

maybe in 3-4 years :)
First it will touch 8k-10k support...

What your are doing is not "investing" its more "trading"... not everyone wants to trade����‍♂️
@_date: 2018-10-08 18:45:38
Its not a ROI of 120%���� A ROI of that amount would mean u made 6690 Dollar
@_date: 2018-10-10 11:26:58
nice crap site����

5-10x is still realistic in 3-5 years..
Mcaps are still low and the crowd left the market.. Trust me once people see the green days again, they will fomo back.. thats human psychology... Mostly people dont learn from their mistakes and the greed is stronger��

Its a fucking paper.. During my master I wrote a lot of papers, based on stupid assumptions..
First of all, miners moving away from china, because the government doesnt support it.. And if you really think a business like bitmain would destory the environment then you are dumb.. In theory its sounds easy " we got a enough hashpower, lets destroy everything or be corrupt" but I doubt that this works so easily practical.. 
Also maybe u notice that this site is spreading crap/fud content.. Read up this subreddit "crypto is about to implode", yeah thats why the industry are looking more and more for people that want to work in the blockchain space.
Dont believe everything because its a study or some influencer say this..

Maybe we should make a paper about how much energy we cannot use, because of grid overload.. Especially in germany renewabel energy plants get shout down..
@_date: 2018-10-28 10:47:02
Please sell.. You invested in sth u dont understand..
@_date: 2018-10-29 18:24:22
its not about the consumption.. its about the resources that are used, in this case conventional energy.
Doesnt matter if it is bitcoin or another product that used much energy. Our goal is not to reduce high consumption products, our goal is to produce cleaner energy�� So in this case our government is the main problem or big companys that used coal for energy production.

Maybe tether should print some brains for people like u :)
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:47:09
I call this article bullshit...
Everytime btc declines at major support, article like this appears and guess what... Whales dump their btc to create panic... Really? I am tired of this shit, honestly...
@_date: 2018-06-14 18:55:57
Thanks for your effort... Looks really interesting!
@_date: 2018-06-16 10:09:47
Have u ever written an own paper? I cannot take this shit anymore... This shit is based on assumptions without any real evidence only some transaction histories..
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:47:23
Next FUD to explain the Dip right now??
The biggest manipulation is the media and a few players that use it to dump on the market when we have low volume... I got a Master Degree and u should learn to work scientifically... These studies are big shit and a joke based on guesses...
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:58:01
Thank you slush :)
@_date: 2018-11-15 06:29:26
this mentality is what people let rekts...
Every time people thought their projects are on sale it hit a weeks later a new low point.. But yes buy the projects and sell them in the next bounce.. Holding in this bear market is the dumbest thing to loose money
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:43:19
you guys are so stupid.. The only thing that ruined the market are you with the FUD/panic..
If it happens then it happens, but these speculation are shit
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:45:15
Prediction end of the next week.. Above downtrendline (above 10300 Dollar)
Mark my words!
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:23:15
Wow the author clearly not understand what crypto is about nice shit article :)
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:35:51
Yeah! Do what he told you, dump Bitcoin now, so he can buy cheap :D
@_date: 2018-07-17 10:28:41

By reading these comments the etf will never get approved..
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:24:25
