So true.
I didn't realize until reading your post, then I really started laughing.

At what pricepoint you bought at is not so relevant, when you don't state the amount of your networth that you invested.
For all we know you could be a millionaire buying bitcoin for 50k dollars, or a single mom moving her son's 9k$ 
collage fund over in entirety to bitcoin.

Nice wit you got there :)
I enjoyed your subtle humor, and have a nice hodl sir

Ok, that might be a small factor.
But seriously? No, just no. It might be a small contributing factor, but certainly not anywhere the largest (talking about needing fiat for gifts).

I've been expecting it since 6-7k ^^

Intelligence does not present itself in each and every individual the same way.

Depending on where you live and what your ambitions are I hope you bought in for more than 1-10k dollars back then.
Anyways great balls of steel if you didn't decrease your position all the way up to 20k, especially if you bought in for more than 10k back when it was under 100 bucks. 
But you are allowed to sell small portions of your stake you know. It's not a pure either/or scenario.

I hope to see a 5k btc, or even a 2k btc. won't care if I average at 2+ times the low point. I'll be moving some of my networth in, and be willing to lose it. If I can be ROIed in fiat at btc (not counting btc holdings) in x years I'm happy, if I lose 50k usd in 10 years time, I honestly wouldn't mind, since I know I'd regret it more not "trying".
But if btc quickly skips back to 15-20k usd I'm not increasing my stake in such an aggresive manner.
And I won't be buying so much, if I feel the risk is real and not just speculative forces driving the price.

at the price point btc is at now, it feels like 2k wouldn't even matter. I mean 100x profit, 200k? how's that gonna change your life?
that saying I've got 3.5k invested, and near the peak, some of it it sha-256 contracts.
Boy, am I actually relieved to see this dip, compared to the plans I had. Now they are modified to say the least. Thank you for not giving me FIAT for stocks selled immediately

Here's my most laid back plan if you want to invest in btc purely for profit (cause you don't believe in the technology, only $$$):
1. Buy btc for an amount your comfortable losing (be it 2k, 20k or 200k for rich or risk-accepting people).
2. Set preset price points where you would sell a percentage of your holding. Say 10%
3. if you hit your price mark, next mark is double that, where you sell another 10% (of original holding). So if price doubles 10 times you're out of btc.
3.b Every time price doubles you take out twice the value of your last time cashing out, but always slightly more than the sum total of all previous cashing outs.
4 You are not allowed to take out cash until 10 years from buying, except when following the above.
Instead of worrying about price fluctuations such a plan, would remove all the stress around everything, as long as you have the mindset that your investment; you're willing to lose it, or at the very least not ever see ROI!
This is written partly as a joke, but really it's not a bad idea when dealing with a high-volative currency like bitcoin, and you're not Warren Buffet.
If you got into bitcoin at the very start when it was 0.00x$- 9.99$ and you followed such a strategy to today, then well, you'd be a very happy camper. If you believed that during your lifetime, btc might be potentially at 1M$, and you wanted to keep 50% of btcs purchased when it was at (for example) around 1$, you could sell about 1.5% of inital holding whenever btc doubled. 
That would make you about ROIed in cash, at about 32$ (while still keeping 92.5% of initial bitcoin holding, which would make you ~3000% ROIed, but you don't sell that yet, sticking to plan).
But adopting the above model of 1.5% every price jump is ridiculous today, since the potential for increase like it was before just isn't there.
Still, it'd be a fun project and a "sound investment plan" if you REALLY believed in bitcoin back in the day and wanted to make a profit in FIAT as well. Since you could invest 20k dollars (for example, yet again) in something you really believed in, but were willing to lose, AND this is maybe the most important: you're not so greedy or unstable that you care about more money. selling, say 300 btc when it hit 15k usd, you have more than enough money, and you don't "care" that you could sell 10.000 btc and "never need to work again" at that price, cause you're following the plan.

I don't even know what to say, but at least you managed to put him right. I guarantee you, the OP won't get it though

I'll send you a milli btc for your troubles :P

Instead of only having 2-3% of my networth (not including loans and realestate) invested in crypto, I'm going to take this "opportunity" and increase my stake to about 30% over the next half year (depending on developments of course).
Or you could take the alternative lie: I started with 3.3 million btc, started selling at 50 dollars, steadily up to btc hit 20k. My current position is 2.1M btc, and I'm going to sell it ALL before the market truely crashes.
p.s. the lie is indeed a lie, and if you choose to believe it, it will help me to buy more btc at a lower price.
p.p.s. I know this wasn't funny. But I thought it would be when the idea popped into my head, and now I don't want to not post it.

I was under the impression that the graph was supposed to always be moving towards the right along the x-axis?
That blue graph :D
