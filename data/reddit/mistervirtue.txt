FOR REAL THO! I am interested in Cyberpunk, Bankruptcy, Stan Lee, and Vitamin Supplements. I think this graph just shows that BitCoin'ers are varied and diverse group of users just like any other online or physical community. We are technologically literate, interested in the world around us, and care about important topics that can affect the world we care about. 
We enjoy our leisure, our entertainment, our health, our world.
