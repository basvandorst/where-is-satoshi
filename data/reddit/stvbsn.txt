That is so short sighted. Cryptos have the ability to change the world and so many people are focused on a single application of them that a large set of people begin to believe that application is the whole point.

Are you telling me the Muslims may have a hard fork due to lack of consensus?

That's great, for you. Don't belittle crypto because you won't be (intentionally) using it for other purposes.

You took a video of a photoshopped screenshot? You need to navigate to the email from elsewhere, at least! I would recommend you have task manager up and visible as well.
Pro tip: moving the camera is useless. 
Edit: 'task monger' to 'task manager'

I imagine coinbase probably handles a huge majority of the fiat to crypto conversions and most people using other services most likely at least have a coinbase account as well. The 0.95% figure is not in the ballpark and super suspect with no source.
Also, are we really considering the world population to be the "target market" for BTC???

Is your opinion based on any evidence or just pulled out of your ass?

Well, first off, "ballpark" is contextual and no sane person would say that 13m is ballpark to 66m. The order of magnitude here includes 10m to 99m, which is an incredibly large window. Idk how you wrote "20% of" and managed to consider that ballpark. Maybe writing it in another way will give you some more context: 66m is over *500%* of 13m.
Secondly, the whole argument is still an exercise in futility. Target market is ambiguous and completely undefined. The entire world's population is the target market for bitcoin? I love the sentiment, but that's all that really is.
Finally, what even is this chart? What gives it any credibility? Who made it? From what data? 0.95% is an awfully precise number for something that seems pretty ambiguous...

Will software wallets be implementing a validation mechanism to prevent things like this accidentally occurring when LN is fully released?

That is, the point.

We should probably define "adoption" too. If we're treating it as a currency, adopters must be using it as such (spending it regularly).

That is fundamentally untrue. The target market for BTC is for those looking for a crypto store of value, not a currency.
