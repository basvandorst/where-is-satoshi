Great idea! Actually I developed a few Magento payment modules in the past. I'll contact the people who purchase them and see if they are interested.

I agree with you. Most of my points were to support and use Bitcoin when is convenient for me.

I agree with you. Probably is not in the best interests for general public but I think that you are thinking in "general public" as people that live in urban areas.
* 17% of the US population is underbanked
* Immigrants send 120 billions of dollars in remittances every year and they pay up to 10% in fees and exchange rate spread
* Anonymity. You would be surprise of the profile that a commerce or a bank can create based on your spending habits
* Reduced risk for merchants. Fully settled in ~30 minutes and no chargebacks (3.1 billions in 2011)

I partially agree with you. I try to buy the same amount of bitcoin that I'm spending regardless the amount that I'm buying to keep.
I think that the volume and number of transactions is vital to grow.

True since is a public ledger. But is also true that with the ability of having multiple wallets (lets say one per incoming transaction) help you to preserve anonymity? As far as I know there is no simple way to associate the person who is making the purchase with a previous profile.

I have no authority nor knowledge to write a mathematical or economic paper. But I would be interested in read similar papers. Do you know any? I tried to look for academic papers but I couldn't find any.

Thanks. Actually I'm a software engineer. The only think that I can think of, is to make Spanish versions (my native language) of existing software/applications or contribute to existing ones.
I like the idea to develop something that makes easy to use and let the code take care of the complexity.
Do you have any idea in mind?

I'll disagree with you. If they don't find value on it, is like them paying you with tulips because they find value on them (

This is what I can think of right now. Can you think in anything else to complement my answer?
* Decentralized control
* Anyone can start accepting payments (have you seen the Visa and MasterCard rules for merchants?
* Will help to bank the unbanked
* Anonymity. I like the idea that you can make electronic transaction with the same level of anonymity than cash. I bet you Whole Foods know the timeframe that I might go tomorrow based on my card.
* Low fees! For merchants is even cheaper than debit transactions
* No reversals. This is great specially for online merchants, no more chargebacks

Didn't know that. Thanks!

Thanks! I never thought on writing to my elected officials.

Same happened to me. 69 bits fee and still waiting for confirmations.

They might received a CERTSI abuse notification who is reporting bitcoin nodes. 
I'm running a node and I received the same email.

This sounds as a good solution
