2140 there will be a decision 
long before then, I would guess another chain gets started from 0 with the same tech (not a fork), people can start moving between the new and old chain in 2100 or so as the new chain increases in value and the old chain will just be fee driven in future 
that is my idea what will happen, there will be better ones 100 years from now
@_date: 2019-07-15 04:02:38
buy a new one? bitcoin is held on the blockchain -- you only hold the private key through some access point
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:34:14
You would need to transact with someone who accepts bitcoin
It isnt banned. People can and do accept bitcoin today in the US, if it were banned, there would STILL be people accepting it. 
You realize we are going to a cashless society? Meaning everyone will have to trust that the central banks digital money is "accurate" and risk them stealing your shit whenever they want. 
We kind of need sovereign money that isnt big rocks of gold, so dont expect bitcoin to just "go away" even if it is banned.
@_date: 2019-07-17 07:48:23
believe and value "whatever you want" 
You might need to sell it to the next guy - the smarter we all are, the better bitcoin (and whatever "crypto" becomes) is 10 years from now. There might not be ANYTHING if we arent smart about adoption from a "bitcoin first" rule, where everyone can know they wont get screwed.

When Bitcoin price goes down its usually to squeeze out some more altcoins 
What funded every altcoin project? Bitcoin. 
There is no other store of value in the whole space, so if that's what bitcoin is for then this is going to be a pretty lame ass space.

lol poor people are cute 
i found a wallet tonight full of stupid bullshit like LTC and ETH that i easily swapped to bitcoin and now feel great to have real money. Then I got drunk to celebrate my $5k "win" (which is probably a $50k BTC loss - technically)  
This is why bitcoins price does not matter, at the very least you dont own a shitcoin. Fiat is better than most shitcoins but not bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:52:10
Son, there are two economies. The one above ground, that the regulators approve of and allow you to buy and sell things the way they like. And the underground market where we use cash (dying) and bitcoin. 
The ones who work and have money on the sidelines that cant be touched by governments, are going to be the wealthier ones in the future. 
Note: the rich do this NOW with their offshore banks and expensive lawyers. Bitcoin is just leveling out the playing field so everyone has a chance for money that cant be seized or controlled by the government like the rich people do.

nah lets not


You're begging in a very odd way with FUD theories
@_date: 2019-07-12 16:51:23
You know that bitcoin does not require a website for people to use it right? 
It is a decentralized "store of value" that anyone can own and transfer between two parties without requiring intermediaries. 
It doesnt need permission to go wallet to wallet anywhere on the internet and NO you cant ban wallets. 
India is FUD'ing a ban of bitcoin - the Rupee to Bitcoin purchases in Cash are just like the gold purchases people have made in that country for decades. 
Nobody trusts certain currencies in certain places. A ban of a currency people trust more than a government currency WONT work. See Venezuela for proof of this.

Both of those have something to do with changing from ERC20 to their own protocol I think ? Like EOS is a top 10 coin lol, how the hell you move it from electrum wallet with the other tokens is beyond me.

yeah its in binance too but it was erc20 then became something else... VET was VEN or something on erc20 now on different protocol. 
Thats the worst part of adopting erc20 tokens early, people have plans for their own protocol but fund the project with the tokens then move it. Look at Tron, I have some of that shit still too actually.
@_date: 2019-07-17 07:42:59

Or we could just get rid of bitcoin? anyone want that or they wanna drop their shitcoins and stop acting like greedy bitches that want to make a quick buck

People with a lot of bitcoin start to think they have more voting rights than regular people at some point. 
Then they fork bitcoin and lose money trying to convince the world they are going to fix bitcoin.

No, it just adds another tax. Dollar has lost 95% of its value since creation. 


People wont starve, live on the streets and run around naked because they could see their spending power increase momentarily. 
Keynesian's like to use this line to make people believe there is no possible way the economy would work without their bullshit. Economists aren't taught to questions the models that worked 50 years ago, just print dollars and tell everyone the problems are solved. 


There is a point it stabilizes in value, which makes it actually useful as a currency. It isn't even close to that right now so we hodl. 
The problems it solves for removing middlemen and rent seekers gauging the holders of money, far outweigh the minor concerns of economists not getting to inflate and increase the money supply whenever the governments want.

The scarcity of the protocol isnt as valuable as having thousands of miners paying millions per day to mine millions of dollars worth of bitcoin and verify each others work so that the payments are all reconciled.

Read Treasure Islands if you're interested in this 
The US off shores (Delaware), compete with UK off shores (British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands) and European off shores (Guernsey, Jersey, Malta) and China off shores (Singapore, Hong Kong). There are also Bahamas, Panama and a few others that people use from all over to hoard money without having tax issues. 
These banks all compete for the non-taxed revenue that each country has and usually politicians are involved in some way with hoarding money outside of taxation. 
Bitcoin cuts into the rich peoples advantage of not paying tax when they dont want to. If peasants can do it then there is no point being rich or having politicians as friends.

The business needs to want to acquire bitcoin for reason other than paying bills and employees (which is difficult at the moment) 
Personally, I would offer bitcoin payments for 3-6 months (as a maximalist) and let it ride like the badass I am. 
Your question makes the assumption the business wants to sell, not see the long term gains of forcing Mastercard and Visa to be reasonable to businesses wanting to use their services. 
TRUST ME, there are many businesses that are willing to lose money to force some competition for those payment processors....they dont do shit ffs.

Altcoins are less profitable than every before since they became a "bitcoin extraction device," many shady people used to extract peoples bitcoin. 
IF Bitcoin = Money 
A good altcoin marketing pitch can extract peoples bitcoin 
These teams can sell the suckers bitcoin and move onto next Altcoin marketing plan

Edit: Since OP edited "Inb4 "why would you want to sell". If everyone HODLing today held forever, Bitcoin would lose its utility. A little redistribution never hurt anybody." 
We are hodling until bitcoin is recognized by the masses as a better store of value than Fiat Currencies and Gold. That may take 10 or 20 years but we have the better money so why not accumulate it during the accumulation phase? We can spend 10% or less of it yearly and still call ourselves hodlers.

Your cousin could just go to a different country ? You claim he has a shit ton....there is no reason to send your bitcoin to someone else to cash out for you.  
Just use a bitcoin credit card and pay the stupid fees to swap your bitcoin for fiat or buy things. Pay for a flight with bitcoin and he can cash it out in a country that isnt banned.... this is simple stuff to figure out

I would go with sell half kinda strategy because as smart as you are, the people with BIG money have plans for how and when they want to buy this asset 
If they go into buying bitcoin AND buying shorts on bitcoin again, you just get rekt. So if their is no real passion to support bitcoin just gotta stay out cause those posers should stay out.

well its the first new asset class available to mankind in about a century (not created by bankers), so it's rather volatile

It can't. They are different THINGS. 
A car cant replace an airplane, one can get you to the other easier. 


Why does the white paper start: 
"A  purely   peer-to-peer   version   of   electronic   cash   would   allow   online payments   to   be   sent   directly   from   one   party   to   another   without   going   through   afinancial institution." 
Read the white paper 


Proof of work 
How is money created? Learn that before commenting on bitcoin. Fiat is printed when the central bank needs more money (usually for the government). 
Proof of work requires mining to acquire one of the 21million bitcoin that will be release over the next 140 years. Mining costs money and time to gain a bitcoin, which makes the rare coin more valuable over time. 


Yeah save those dollars, euros and pounds. This currency war we are ALL at risk in (regardless of your currency) is going to end perfect for the people holding cash over bitcoin or gold.... sheeesh you kids....  
It was $1-$10 that was a huge risk
Then $10 - $100 was still pretty damn risky
But when $1000 became a "bottom" we wont see again, $10,000 becomes tomorrows $1,000 bottom we wont see again... good luck

who buys bitcoin just to send a wire? We dollar cost average into bitcoin and use it when we need it. 
If sending $100 in bitcoin (that you bought for $20) bothers you, that's on you

The SEC would need the merchants info though of the address you sent your bitcoin to? If its not a registered item within the banking system of the US, the transaction is still pretty much between you and the merchant. 
Rather than having your internet shopping habits stored in the banks database and viewable to all bank employees and anyone with access to their database. 
Groups that can get others information like this charge a pretty penny and keep it on the down down low how they access it. More and more people are going to realize this and want to protect their personal information in the future.

you can change the protocol by submitting a BIP (bitcoin improvement proposal) 
Developers on the Bitcoin core team comment and plan to add or not add a BIP
Before a BIP is actually committed (see segwit), the entire bitcoin ecosystem is going to have a say about what that change could mean. IF enough of the users are against the proposal, the chain will fork like we saw with bcash 
To get an actual improvement in the code, there is a LONG and arduous process to go through. If Bitcoin is working (blocks are solved every 10 minutes) then we dont want a change on the protocol level to affect users of bitcoin and its overall value. 
The same core principles of "decentralized store of value that anyone can transfer P2P without requiring intermediaries" MUST stay in tact. 
If a BIP is too out there, you could probably do a side chain (Liquid), second layer (Lightning Network) or create an altcoin to prove the use case of a different idea. 
Altcoins just have an idea, create a whitepaper and market to steal peoples bitcoin.

bunch of hedge funds saw an unregulated market they could buy an asset and buy shorts on it clean up on ? 
See when you own an asset you can sell and when you short the asset before selling you clean up. That's what they did and will try to do in the future.

In the banking system part sure. As long as you aren't submitting KYC, using public wifi to do transactions, wallet to wallet is fairly anonymous. 
The coinjoin and wasabi wallet type anonymity will probably scale as governments become more predatory about wanting back doors and tracking people. 
China is another one that wants it tracked, it's all or none though.
Edit: missed this earlier 


They're idiots and gloom and doomers. Its not designed to track everyone.

If I can just make a 5-10% gain on my bitcoin to offset the on and off ramp fees for fiat to Bitcoin, then Im happy 
I still offset inflation 
I can still take my fiat in any currency, transfer it into a digital decentralized store of value and get ANY other currency 
Over time we could easily get rid of the Trillions of dollars daily running through the Forex markets by those rent seekers that contribute nothing to society 
At least bitcoin is honest money and not promising ANYTHING to the buyers, holders and sellers accepting it as digital money
PEOPLE NEED TO LOWER THEIR EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THEY WANT FROM BITCOIN. IT ISN'T THERE TO MAKE YOU RICH, IT MIGHT KEEP YOU FROM GOING BROKE THOUGH...
@_date: 2019-08-11 23:10:14
but the assets value appreciates as time goes on, rather than depreciating due to inflation like fiat currency

earn it? 
Buy at a bitcoin meetup? 
Go to an OTC exchange that sells for cash w/o ID requirement? 
Use a site like bisq or hodlhodl? 
Buy/Sell/Trade with friends, family, co-workers as they enter the ecosystem? 
Buy from a merchant that takes bitcoin? Some dont want tax on their bitcoin, so they're willing to sell it for cash. 
There are plenty of anonymous ways but you're correct that we need to make sure the options continue to grow
@_date: 2019-08-19 01:48:42


when it went from $1 to 10, or $10 to $100 per bitcoin? 
Or when it went from $100 to $1000 area? 
You have to be specific, so we know what range in the last 10 years you are referring to. 


well it is used to buy and sell things, as well as a store of value for some. People use bitcoin however they want. 


Second layers and side chains will launch over the next decade - lightning network and liquid are two (there will be more though). 
Each work with bitcoin to allow for different/quicker payment options with your bitcoin, they all have different trade-offs for this convenience though.

If you have access to banking, don't understand inflation or monetary policy, what reason would anyone have to buy it? 
Maybe people in tech who want to learn how money works but most people like being stupid until they need to learn something for a reason.

There is not do or die moment that has anything to do with the fiat currency war 
Will humans realize they are enslaved by a central bank that can change the value of their money whenever they want? Oh shit, maybe Fiat currency wont be popular in the future 
Is bitcoin an open source protocol anyone can see the code and monetary policy of (rather than have politicians telling the central bank to change monetary policy)? Oh fuck, that makes so much more sense than expecting humans to not be corrupt 
Game over Fiat

You probably need to be clear about your goal with bitcoin or its just going to mess with you? 
Some of us arent looking to cash out a little profit until it's in the 50 and 100k areas, watching the price would be kind of stupid daily/monthly as it might be 4-5 years from now.

I imagine the actual boom will be 15k to 50k in like a week. Then similar bullshit fluctuations like we're seeing between the 7-13k areas. 
So many people are going to be taking out tiny profits or getting out entirely around that area, its going to be this long ass 5 year wait for the 100k level to ever hit.

2nd this, blockchain.poker has me believing it will all be BTC gambling
Good thing is they have a faucet for no-coiners to see how cool having actual sats makes you 
Bad thing is they have BSV and Bcash for no real reason (assuming bcashers support the site or something). It would be really cool if it were bitcoin only but shills just have to be everywhere.
