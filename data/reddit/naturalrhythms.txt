Ok cool. Thank you I'll do a bit of research.

I did my first test purchase through the Mycelium app - they charged a 10% fee. When I bought a more substantial amount, I went through Coinmama (5% fee). My options were limited because I'm buying with a NZ visa.

Do you mind if I ask a couple more questions?
1. So when I buy say $500 worth of bitcoin, will they send me some sort of unique code? When you say "send them to a wallet" what exactly is being sent?
2. Call me oldschool, but I'm keen to have it on a piece of paper that I can store safely in a physical location. How does that all work? Can I just write down the code on a piece of paper? And how can I be sure that the code isn't floating around online somewhere?

It's just too interesting, and easy, to keep an eye on it. Hopefully I get bored one day, and forget about it for a few years.

I've just got it sitting in Mycelium at the moment - would you recommend something different?

Mind point out what you consider to be ignorant? Always interested to learn.

I don't like your presumption that I'm taking this point of view because I feel like "people are more successful than" me. I honestly don't consider anyone to be more successful than myself (sorry, that sounds really arrogant) - because to me success isn't measured in wealth, it's measured in how able I am to live according to my own values - just as you said "we each have our own values". I'm just fortunate, and hugely appreciative, that I am able to live almost exactly aligned to my own values (which happens to be super easy to do if you ditch the artificial capitalism-perpetuating 'values' that marketers jam down our throats every day).
You're right though, when you say "capitalism lifts people out of poverty" - because poverty is generally defined as the state of one who lacks a certain amount of material possessions or money. And yes, capitalism has absolutely enabled people to own more material possessions and/or money.
But I reckon that the more important statistic to look at is contentedness (after all, isn't true happiness the only thing that *really* matters?) - and I honestly don't think that owning more material possessions and/or money makes people content.
So what makes people content? From what I've seen (and I'm no expert on this) the biggest contributors to contentedness are almost never materialistic possessions - rather they're things like family, friendships, free time to pursue passions, etc. And sadly, in lots of capitalist societies, a large portion of the population ends up being convinced that family, friendships etc won't make you as happy as a new BWM.
So yeah, maybe my beef should be with marketers &amp; consumerism - but I don't think either of those things would be as potent without capitalism (and I'm a big fan of treating the cause of issues, not just the symptoms, which is why I think capitalism is the issue).
Also, don't get me wrong, I'm hugely appreciative of some of the luxuries that capitalism has enabled - the things that have enabled things like family, friendships and free time to proliferate (communication, travel speed, etc).
It just makes me feel empty inside when I see people who in emotional ruin because they spend their whole lives working (rather than spending time with each other, or doing the things they love) under the impression that they will be happier if they buy more shit (which they have to work more to get).
Hah, sorry for the huge essay man, mostly just wanted to write it to vent myself. Plus it helps clarify my own thoughts. Take it easy!

Hah sorry dude. Didn't mean to make you cringe. I was just hoping to inspire a bit of confidence.

Democracy is what you're thinking of. It's very different to capitalism.
@_date: 2017-08-29 02:56:04
Yeah! If you don't fit into the toxic capitalist norms that are poisoning society, we don't want ya!

You just compared a system of goods &amp; production organisation to a system of governance. They're very different things.
Regardless, you think that capitalism best system (of goods &amp; production organisation) in the world?
The same system that has convinced people that pursuing a career is more important than spending time with their kids? The system that has convinced millions of people to waste their lives working flat-out just to make ridiculous wealth for less than 1% of the population (the Trumps etc)? The system that has resultantly increased the rates of suicide and mental illness to the highest they've ever been? 
I really hope one day you guys realise how intensely your lives are being wasted for the benefit of a few corporations and CEOs, and how negative capitalism and consumerism is in our lives.
It's possible to live outside the reach of the controlling grasp of capitalism, and I can tell you from personal experience that life is far more fulfilling.

Yeh, the first time I was introduced to it was 2 years ago during the last spike. My flatmate was convinced by his brother to buy. He also ummed and ahhed too long and ended up buying at the top of the peak. He was horrified by the drop in value, and sold as soon as he broke even again a year or so later (despite me telling him he was a madman to do so... if it's steadily worked itself back to break even, then it's a pretty sure bet that it'll keep going. He's kicking himself pretty hard nowadays).
I'm fairly sure we'll see another big drop in price with this spike. I can't wait. It'll give me the opportunity to get my mits on even more bitcoins! But for now, I'm resting assured by the thought that even though I paid a lot, at least I've got my toe in the door if it does continue to ramp up.

I first heard about it at the start of the first peak (a couple years ago). My flatmate and his brother bought in then (using some inheritance that they'd received). I was interested, but also a poor student at the time - so I couldn't spare any money to invest, nor was I thinking about investing at all (because I couldn't). It also seemed like quite an un-tested, and dangerous investment at the time (hadn't yet proven itself to be robust, it was relatively new). So I didn't really look into it at all (if I had, I would have seen the value, and scraped together what little money I had - they were at ~$200 then).
It popped back into my head when my flatmate asked my thoughts on him selling his bitcoins (which had just broken even again after the crash). I told him he was mad to sell, and that if anything this was the time to buy more. He sold... I still didn't have enough money, and hadn't done the research.
I largely forgot about it until this recent spike. I checked the graphs etc, which gave me more assurance of bitcoins robustness - other than the spikes, it'd had a pretty steady track. So I did a bit more research and found out exactly what it is, and that it's worth investing in.
Obviously it was (is) doing an unsustainable spike, so I was nervous about buying at such a high price, but I was more nervous about the idea of it not being a spike, and it running away even more. So I bought. I havn't put very much money into it at all - no more than I can afford to lose. But at least I've got a toe in the door in case it does go all Microsoft on us.

Yeah I've just bought a little as a super long term investment - not spending them. Can you give me any recommendations for how to make/where to get a paper wallet?
