Selling your bitcoin would be bad for 2 reasons:
1. Hodl! Ffs you could retire when your 40 with the bitcoin you get from sex work. 
2. Taxes, especially capital gains which here is 30%. Unless you have a family like mine that lives in a place with no capital gains tax at all.

It would follow a similar structure to the drug trade, which would only make it more valuable. People don't like being told what they can and can't buy.
I'm hoping it follows the same route as prohibition of alcohol but where the us dollar loses business and falls in value. The government sees that investors will move there money from stocks to bitcoin to make more profit, which impacts the economy. 
If the government legalises it they lose, it becomes a legal currency that has boomed during its prohibition and will create a vacuum that will pull in big business and continually outperform USD and eventually lead to global adoption.

As it becomes harder to mine bitcoin, the more expensive your energy becomes and therefore the more renewable energy is used to sustain profits

I think bitcoin would perform better than gold because physically it's easier to use and verify and I don't have to hire someone to mine it on mass, all I need is a group of computer miners. It's certainly harder to mine bitcoin but it's easy to transport and hold and sell. As a race we are travelling towards a more relaxed society, talking to each other is easy, getting food, getting paid etc. I think gold will always be around but bitcoin will be seen as the preferred asset and even currency (eventually)

Well for me fees are reduced because their faster payment service is down, so I sold a portion and reinvested at a lower price for more coins. But I'd wait, it could go up again and re-test the12k level

100k, if the recession is predicted to be next year (although technically it's already started) then that will likely push the price up greatly and correct itself over the rest of year. And adoption could accelerate during this period. Countries like China and South Korea are already pushing bitcoin, other economies would lose business and innovation so be forced to do the same. The current trade war is a key step in the us economy right now and losing it could disastrous to the dollar. 
But that's just my thoughts.

Of course the government want to crash bitcoin, imagine another financial crisis where bitcoin is unaffected. People will race towards it, the banks best bet it to eliminate bitcoin and continue crashing the economy for profit.

You can convert into tether or USDC and re-invest, as long as you don't convert to fiat. I'd keep a record of your profit in case regulation changes though. 
If we sell for tether (a stablecoin resembling the price of the dollar) the exchange is currently 1 tether=80p, so 100 tether profit would be £80. And then to re-invest you would calculate the amount the want to invest divided by the current price e.g. 80÷13000=0.0061538462. 
But you need you also need to work in fees as well 
I would imagine that the tax wouldn't fluctuate as the price changes because it would be set in stone. Like how I don't pay further tax on all my pay slips when the tax increases, I would pay more on my next pay slip. 
At least that's my interpretation of it

If you sold it for fiat then it would be taxable but as it currently stands, if you sold it for another crypto like tether it wouldn't be taxable.
