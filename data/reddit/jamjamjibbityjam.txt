Am I too late?

Is it still going?


What do I have to do to get 1000 bits? Is a song and dance enough?

They are if we say they are DAMMIT!!
But seriously, if people are able and willing to treat them like currency, then they should be considered currency. Simple as that :/

[Here]( is a list of sites where you can exchange bitcoins for gift/debit cards. 
If you really want Amazon gift cards, I would exchange some of mine for bitcoins. PM me if you are interested.

I don't *know* for sure, but my guesses as to why this would be an attractive option for someone are that it's anonymous and quicker than cash. People pay a LOT for anonymity.  
Plus, if you in bitcoin's future, a few extra dollars today won't mean much 5 years from now :/
Oh, and a lot of people use MoneyPaks to launder drug and other illegal money... I'm not exactly sure why someone would go from dirty money -&gt; moneypak -&gt; bitcoins, but I'm guessing they just want to be as far away from that money as possible.

I don't really know about that either... If I were a waitress and some one asked me if I wanted a tip in bitcoins, I would probably say yes to keep from offending the customer, even if I didn't want it. 
You would also make people feel like they *had* to say yes or risk not being tipped at all.

That's pretty messed up! 
I bet you got binlargin's hopes up and everything...

Thank you guys! 
SatoshiCircle is a great looking site, I can't wait to use it! :)

I'm a women, and I was wondering why gender wasn't included. It would be nice to have a rough estimate of female bitcoin users (on reddit).

I believe CampBx has a CapitalOne 360 option, but you have to verify you account first. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:31:50
I'm sure you looked at this already, but here are the instructions, just in case: [under money deposits](

Thank you for telling us what every waiter should feel...
Tipping in America isn't optional, it's a part of the salary for waiters/cooks/greeters.

Lol! His toes look like they can play a mean guitar riff. 
I mean that in the nicest way possible though, feet aren't supposed to be pretty anyways :/
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:08:54
CampBx seems to have a CapitalOne 360 option too, but you need to have your account verified first. 
I'm not sure if its as easy as Bitfloor (I've never used CapitalOne p2p), but it's worth a try I suppose :/

I'm not sure if a service like this exist, but if you or anyone else is thinking about starting a service like this, then please PM me. I've been thinking about an idea like this for a while and I would like to share some of my ideas.
