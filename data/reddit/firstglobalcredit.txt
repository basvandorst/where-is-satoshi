Though a finance service like us should be the last one to comment, the story you mentioned is great and visionary to the world. Unfortunately, the roots of capitalism are too deep to be plucked. 
Bitcoin is after all a plough to at least start the goddamn work, and show us the way to take out the evil.

You are speaking about exchanges that never actually place any trade for you in real. They only earn by bid/offer margin spread that is completely different from the actual market price of your asset. 
And all they do with your holdings is stash, so they can turn the chips down the moment something terrible happens.

Indeed, intersecting cultures bring nothing but havoc and we cannot expect human to react any worse than he already does. But the next age belongs to communication, where information - and thanks to Bitcoin, economy - could be available to all. That's the best we can hope than putting our head inside our pillows.
Speaking in regards to this thread's subject, I think Gaza doesn't need any permission, as long as they are willing to put their youth on the line of innovation. PayPal is now outdated, and distributed technologies are taking over. I represent a company which is big Bitcoin believer, and we surely hope to see this one phenomenon uniting world economy for good.

Their 2000 rupee note has a nano censor installed; it has been speculated that it will help track down money's geographic locations. IMO, its a masterstroke considering that stash holders will have to rely on smaller denominations to store their money. A great step by Reserve Bank of India. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 18:28:56
How can they even control something that is well-off their jurisdictions, and common sense. People will still use Bitcoin - with our without exchanges, via legal or illegal ways.

I have friends in Delhi and they all have suggested to rely on card-based systems for a while. The money for transportation(rail, cabs and autos), food, accommodation can all be paid with debit/credit cards; there is not much an issue there.

@_date: 2016-11-17 07:57:23
but we can still make a political argument out of it, for anybody who is  for banning virtual currencies. The only thing that separates Bitcoin from these upcoming national currencies is decentralisation. So, is control that much important to the government, even if they continue to pull our economies down with poor policies?

It is evident what Circle is up to: They have their own blockchain-based payment service in line, which would directly compete with Bitcoin. They find it easy to bash the digital currency now, and I don't see any reason why I shouldn't compare them with Western Union, which also blasted against Bitcoin after facing serious competition.
From here, we can only realise that Bitcoin is growing stronger by each and every second. Only a successful consensus on SegWit will be our best answer to these fools. Andreas is right: what rights do they have to speak about Bitcoin when they have never invested a single idea/fund to improve the Bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2016-11-03 18:33:23

The world runs on western narrative. I'vent been to Gaza or Israel, nor my political understandings are adequate enough to comment upon such an issue; but I believe that as soon as we can connect people with global protocols - educational, political and economical - the better it would be for those living in the messiest parts of the world. 
Gaza tech industry is free to come up with solutions in order to take an active part in world's economy. Nobody will give it to them, they have to make something of their own. Perhaps a Bitcoin exchange.

Agree! banks are coming up with their own models to beat each others' game. They don't realise that any blockchain model will still be a farce until it supports decentralisation. Will these prestigious institutions cut down their commissions to fairly compete with a service like Bitcoin is still a thing to watch out for.
@_date: 2016-11-16 21:27:44
On the contrary to what i read in this thread, I think having a centralised blockchain-based national currency is a great idea. It certainly proves that regulators are in good terms with Bitcoin technology only and only if they can control it. Bitcoin community should use this fact for its own good. ;)

Optimism is good.. But let's first wait for it to cross the next-few resistance levels. As I can see now, the price first have to sustain itself above the 750 support line. It had previously failed to sustain near these levels, and I think the psychology can replay itself as the selling pressure increases . 
Overall, I hope I'm wrong. :) Best of Luck.

I do agree with your point to some extent, but let's not ignore the national policies a bank must follow - those related to FBI. Cannabis is legal in some states, but agonises Federal Laws - national ones - at the same time. We are speaking about the same banks that entertain no checks, cash Deposits and credit card transactions for cannabis industry. And now when these very businesses are opting for Bitcoin, I am only assuming a possibility for exchanges to run into trouble with their own banks, as they themselves would be prone to KYC/AML procedures.

Indian Central Bank hasn't been vocal against Bitcoin. In fact, they haven't come up with anything concrete since their mandatory investment risk warning back in 2013.

Decisions such as these simply force people to use backdoor channels. And even if people rely on Bitcoin for these money transfers, I am concerned about its limitations among non-techies. Also, regulated exchanges will find it troubling to report transactions to Mexico. That leaves room for either localbitcoins or traditional hawala channels used by drug cartels.

Let's not over analyse a power company's association with Bitcoin. Germany, or one would say the entire Europe (yes UK, you too), contributes very little to the overall Bitcoin mining network.
Also, power companies do not generate electricity in most cases. They buy it from the government, and work solely as the supplier.. To say that government will allocate a special fund to Bitcoin mining farms is....(you choose the word)
@_date: 2016-09-08 13:29:59
The reason for no-trading-fee is simple: there are no trades taking place at all. The exchanges are simply putting traders' bets against each other.

I think its better for you to sit back, and think of the banking protocols that might have been broken accidentally. Banks usually are very peculiar about Bitcoin, for they don't understand the technology very well. 
Best case: approach them, explain things.. And if they still stick to their actions, just join a bank which has a good attitude towards Bitcoin users. They are, after all, banks.

If your words are to be believed, this is the most heinous thing a reputed company like Coinbase can do to Bitcoin on the whole. We are still in the process of spreading Bitcoin adoption among masses, but such events literally spill water on all our efforts as a community.
In the end, legal way is the best way for you. They cannot simply pretend to have sent your money without providing proofs.

Their totalitarian attitude will simply push people towards decentralized technologies, including Bitcoin. FBI is literally working as Bitcoin's best agent.

Their acceptance doesn't make 10 an ace. They are still speaking about private ledgers, while nothing innovative has been said on one main thing - decentralisation. 
Apart from all, Does Hon. Yellen sound funny to anybody? :)

A wonderful analysis, finally. It is time banks understand that they can't beat decentralization with centralization. In fact, by centralizing public ledgers into private ledgers, they will simply put all the eggs in the same basket. Security will always be an issue..

Wonderful! :)

you are almost predicting a doomsday. Bitcoin is decentralised, and a a centralised one would be of no use to anyone, especially when the market is full of alternatives.

Considering the prevailing manipulations in forex markets, Bitcoin is surely a great alternative for IRA markets. It is one of the least performing investment portfolios after 2008, and Bitcoin can surely rejuvenate this sector for good.

Bull period for Bitcoin

What's the point of beating an ad website when the real culprits are roaming free.

At last! Congratulation to all, and many thanks to all the core developers.

they are also planning simplified regulations for Bitcoin startups. It is good to see Asia willing to take a lead in fintech innovation. Japan, India, Singapore, China and now South Korea.
