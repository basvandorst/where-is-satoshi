Bitcoin is a system that
* Preserves the freedom of cash in the digital age.
* Uses information distribution so it can't be easily shut down or broken. [replace 'information distribution' with 'the cloud' if appropriate]
* Is openly reviewed by top security experts.
* Has less overhead both in fees and systems than traditional banking.
* Inspires new ways of thinking about technology and money.
* Provides solutions to communities underserved by traditional banking.
* Is already global, entrenched, and with many imitators, haters and fans.

Maybe a consolation prize for most downvotes- the person the rest think is their biggest threat.

The government can and will gag academic researchers if it is worth it to them. My favorite example is the gag order placed on bat biologists during the first world war. The biologists figured out bats use echolocation. However, at the time, sonar was a secret military technology. So, to keep our advantage in finding uboats, the research was not allowed to be published.

Something like [Trezor]( would be cool. Trezor is open source, MIT license code, so perhaps it could be ported.
