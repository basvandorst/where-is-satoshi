Bandwidth limits seem like a good idea.  I haven't implemented that in [RaiBlocks]( yet but that'd be a good item.

Strictly speaking institutional players wouldn't be worried about lack of regulations but liability for breaking them due to laws being construed in new ways.
There's always a group of people that crave regulation as if it gives you something that you couldn't create on your own.

The short answer is a balance-weighted vote by peers in the network.  The people with the most interest in keeping the network functioning are people with addresses that have balances.
An important benefit is if a person is publishing forks, they only stall their one chain, no one else is affected.  No voting is done if there are no forks.

To me it seemed like running the node could be its own reward.  If you're making use of the system and can dedicate a fixed amount of resources to keeping it alive, every bit would help.  Part of that is because I don't know how to detect bona-fide contribution for chain propagation etc.  It seems like it'd be easy to game.

I actually wrote about that in the [RaiBlocks]( mining section about how incentivizing mining is almost pointless.  Mining is one of the smallest contributions to keeping a crypto alive, propagating the chain, wallets, banks, merchants are all far more valuable but they don't get a blockchain reward.

They get utility out of using a crypto that has no transaction fees and since we're not burning energy mining the cost of running the network as a whole is low.  Blockchain rewards isn't the only value people get out of the system and I personally don't think a blockchain reward isn't really rewarding the biggest contributors to the ecosystem as a whole.
The information for enthusiasts is on the GitHub wiki

I'm not too excited about the success of the distribution.  It seems we have miners which participate in the ecosystem very little and receive all the rewards of inflating everyone else's currency.
We're trying out a recaptcha distribution which I think will even out the distribution wrt real people in addition to letting new people jump on without investing in asics.

Agreed, I think that's one of the technical issues with bitcoin.  In any block interval miners need to negotiate the order the the transactions are placed in the chain, even with no malicious attackers there's still disagreement whether Transaction(a) comes before Transaction(b) in a block or if any transaction belongs in Block(y) or Block(y+1).
The strategy we used is to make 1 chain per address and replicate all chains to all nodes.  This means there's only one person that can add new blocks to any chain meaning the address owner can deterministically order their transactions.  Of course a malicious person can make their node create forks which need resolution but the point is for the usual-case there's no question in what order things happened.

It's interesting they don't do some sort of cementing strategy where they pick a new known-good point and hardcode that in to the client, or at least put it in a config file.  For [RaiBlocks]( I thought it'd be good to add such a mechanism.

Totally agree, mining is one of the smallest aspects of keeping a crypto alive, everything else is far more valuable.  With [RaiBlocks]( we tossed mining rewards and transaction fees all together because they're more hassle than they're worth.
