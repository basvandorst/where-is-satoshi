Pretty sure I paid high fees for real.

No, they’re looking at every transaction, period.
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:09:38
You really blew a gasket there, didn’t you?
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:30:32
I’m sorry for your loss.

The United States collects more taxes in nominal terms than any other country in the world.

These wallets are usually partially written in JavaScript.

Who is still waiting? It’s not going to happen.

Do not weep for government. They will get 20% of all your American gains.

I make new accounts every few months to protect my privacy.

Maybe not so much fear as skeptical of a completely unfounded claim.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:54:55
Only retards thought they could like-kind exchange crypto, anyway.

Did you just femsplain the meaning of mansplain to me? How dare you.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:44:58
Which country? Bitcoin is global.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:58:41
Another unfounded claim.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:15:41
Which country? There are a lot of them.

I’m pretty sure bitcoin doesn’t need you to defend it from criticism. It can certainly stand on its own and maybe even improve a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:16:28
Some people just need something to blame. The idea that the market is made of the whims of idiots and geniuses alike is just too scary.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:10:29
I always liked the idea that Bitcoin rich people will sit on coins until they die, rather than spend it doing rich people stuff.

By “strategy” they just mean which meme do you like best. There’s HODL, buy the dip, a roller coaster gif and others to choose from. Don’t think too hard.

Here is some sales shit from Vanguard that tries to quantify the value of an advisor. It’s moderately convincing, even for a sceptic.

Do you think the people processing payments and changing user passwords are the same people who write the exchange software? Companies have teams of employees so they can do more than one thing at a time.

Not even the craziest ICO proposed today.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:48:32
That would be silly. Many sends are just people moving coins between their own wallets. That’s not a taxable event.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:25:35
I don’t think he gets to decide.

I would trade one agonizing instance of trying to get Linux video drivers working correctly for all of those minor Windows annoyances.
