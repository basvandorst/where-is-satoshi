Also don't publicize the number of bitcoins that you have.

This is what I figured, thanks!

Lets do it.
What did you have in mind to make this a reality?
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:07:06
This would likely be the ideal scenario. Integrate multiple alt coin trading which would increase the favorability of the exchange itself. Also creating a specific altcoin for legacy coins (Goxcoins) which would have withdraw limitations.

Instead of increasing it by 50% every year, is it possible to just increase it based on demand, similar to the way the difficulty works?

Have you considered putting your weight behind a resolution?
Whether it's pressure to find the truth, or a buyout, or a community run exchange?
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:25:07
I wanted to do this as well. I actually registered the domain  last year to do this. I'd love to work together to make something like this happen!

Is everyone dillusional in this subreddit? I've been involved in bitcoin since it was under $5. Also a tech saavy individual with suffucient development experience.
For me to secure my bitcoin AND actually use it has been a major pain in the ass, and i'm still likely not doing it effectively... 
How do you expect your grandma to? Something like securing gold is fairly straight forward to MOST individuals.  Don't tell anyone about it and hide it in a secure place. Then there are many other levels of security... Sure bitcoin follows the same idea, however the reality is that it's apples to oranges.
@_date: 2015-02-12 01:02:12
If bitcoin want's to become what everyone wants it to become, then there are fundamental issues that need to be addressed.
If large companies like coinbase, bitstamp,or many others can't properly secure their bitcoin, even with high paid security experts.
How can Joe Blow who uses Password1 as his password? You may want to ignore this fact, but then you're just being willfully naive. More often than not, people are not taking the steps that "should" be taken to secure their data. And it will likely be this way for many years, if not forever. Fortunately, the system of today allows for laziness.
And it's not just "dumb" people.. It's people from all walks of life. CEOs, College Students, Tech people, everyone.  
Being in the tech industry, nobody i know lives a fully secure life. They don't properly backup all their data, encrypt all their data, take every precaution against potential sources of dataleaks, they use the same passwords for everything, etc. So if the majority of these people who are supposed to be at the "cutting edge" aren't taking the necessary steps, then how will anyone else?

What does litecoin bring to the table that bitcoin does not (besides the "asic resistance")?

Gold has a LONG history as well as a lot of practical uses.
• Currency Exchange
• Investments
• Science
• Industrial
• Medical
• Commercial
In addition to that, the major holders of gold are governments.
Who controls bitcoins? Poor college students.
Bitcoin's only uses are investment &amp; commerce. and for the most part only being used as an investment tool right now.
And it likely has more enemies than gold does.

I could see many reasons from silk road, to tax evasion, to funding terrorism to potentially contributing to the destabilization of the dollar.
If bitcoin becomes an enemy target of the government, they have many ways to destroy bitcoin. Whether it's directly taking it down, destabilizing the currency through financial means, taking down major bitcoin hubs legally or illegally. And they likely will always have the ability to attempt a 51% attack.
I think it's naive to think that we're safe, or will be in the near future. The currency is still in beta form, the primary use is for drugs &amp; gambling. Sure more people are adopting, but
It seems naive to think we're actually safe in anyway, even with widespread adoption. It takes less than a million dollars now to take over the bitcoin network. I doubt it ever would, but even if it costed a billion to take over the network, the government would do it in a heartbeat if they felt threatened.
So part of me wonders how we will ever be safe? Even if a million of us had ASIC rigs, the government would buy a million themselves. Or destabilize the currency in a different way. So how does bitcoin succeed in the long term if the eventual plan negatively effects large governments?

The difference is, people have much more incentive to push drugs...
• Great financial incentive for those who import, export, sell, grow, etc.
• Addictiveness, which causes users to take more risks and make more sacrifices in order to obtain.
There is much less incentive to keep bitcoin alive for most.

I think it's more like a developer that got into trading... being told to go develop a program to trade.

Posts like these shine a light of immaturity &amp; greed on bitcoin, which can only hurt the cause.
@_date: 2013-04-01 03:19:17
I feel that this point needs to be pressed a bit more.
@_date: 2013-04-01 01:22:37
I feel like this is similar to comparing bitcoin against warez. There a lot of different variables at play with data vs currency.
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:26:09
What about for the past century?
@_date: 2013-03-31 23:32:48
This is my point exactly, the mentality of most on here is the opposite of yours. And I feel that their collective mentality may hurt the bitcoin community from its ultimate goals.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:05:40
I hope you're trolling, because otherwise you're just too awesome!
@_date: 2013-03-25 02:08:55
I have no idea why people are downvoting you. I agree with you.
While I agree that litecoin itself isn't necessarily a threat to bitcoin, the only real benefit of litecoin is for people to get in early to make money. I was able to get a good amount of litecoin at 4 cents, now it's worth 55 cents... But i'm only doing this to try to make some money. Essentially a penny stock
Bitcoin on the other hand, is something i'm fully vested into for idealistic purposes. 
I feel that the essentially endless number of bitcoin-variants that may be created will likely do more harm than good... 
For example, lets say I try to get a friend to join the digital currency movement, but since bitcoin is so expensive, I decide to tell him to get in early with LTC. LTC then crashes, because there's no market for it... It would likely hinder the efforts of expanding digitial currencies as well as create a negative experience.
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:47:47
And to many of the counter arguments regarding using bitpay or similar services... What's the point of bitcoin if we're just using it for fiat currencies?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:05:36
You go away. He's not talking about a bitcoin transfer. He's talking about a sell order on an exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-15 20:34:18
There is likely a large number of people that have less than 1 bitcoin that are participating in mtgox trades for experience &amp; entertainment purposes.
I think a fixed rate wouldn't be bad, but at the same time, I know when I first started trading with mtgox it was at a rate of like $15/trade, which helped me learn without too much risk.
@_date: 2013-03-05 10:39:55
I &lt;3 you!!! Thank you very much for doing this. You're doing a great thing for more reasons than one. Helping Charities and helping new people get into bitcoin!

I think he's being sarcastic. "This time it's different" is a common phrase that is used in financial trading to convince themselves and others that this time it will be successful and continue growing.

What is the benefit to an "average individual" to continue trying to use bitcoin, if it had been marked as illegal?
The benefit to those users that purchase drugs is the high, and that creates a specific demand which pushes the supply.

How do people know this site wasn't created by the gov?
@_date: 2013-03-31 05:26:00
I agree with you that there will still be a small underground community using bitcoin, but that's not the goal of bitcoin.
You severely underestimate the power of our government.
They can make legislation making it illegal, as well as close surrounding infrastructure and exchanges... Once they've done that... What legitimate use do we have left for bitcoin?
All the businesses and normal individuals will have fled, and those that remain will likely be the idealistic ones.
And even if it remains thriving in an underground format, the government can easily destabilize the currency from within as well.

Why would a company like google pay a billion for mtgox, when they could create a better, more reliable exchange with a better name like... GOOGLE?
If google made their own exchange, everyone from mtgox would transfer over immediately, without google lifting a hand.
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:46:57
Honestly, it's no more than a feeling, but i'm sure that i'm not alone.
I feel that the actual use of bitcoin is not growing at a pace that sustains this kind of growth

Yep, it'll likely refresh with the agreed sell price. and USD will show up.

Honestly, I don't want my data, let alone finances handled by Mega.
