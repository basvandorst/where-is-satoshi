I don't think it's the right place to talk here (because then people will think I am trying to sell my bag) :P

The way the network is going I prefer gaining $$$ from TXs without the volatility.

Smart Contracts would refer to Ethereum more than what Bitcoin IMO.
@_date: 2016-01-31 20:13:43
Quite a few people. But I wouldn't be stupid in spending any ETH, even that small of a fraction :)

This has nothing to do with bitcoin. UjoMusic is based on Ethereum, you can see that on their official website and to pay for the song is ~0.23ETH or $0.60.

What a POS...

Please stop. You might have innocent intentions but if Ethereum is good enough which IMO it is, people will realize it in due time. Be patient Rome was not built in a day.

All I see is little children fighting.

UjoMusic is built on Ethereums not Bitcoins blockchain.

On the evening of Friday, 13 November 2015, a Gemini customer notified us that they had placed a very large market order on the exchange in error.
After reviewing the trade, our account review team and executive management determined that the trade was made due to customer error, and meets our criteria for reversal as defined in our terms of service. Following this determination, we reversed each trade that resulted from the market order.
You are receiving this email because you were the counterparty to one of the trades that took place as a result of the erroneous customer order. You may notice that your account balances have changed as a result. You will also see an admin credit and debit entry in your transaction history on Gemini for the trade reversal.
Gemini customers are ultimately responsible for ensuring the accuracy of their orders before placing trades. Trade reversal decisions are made fully at the discretion of Gemini management in cases where the erroneous nature of the trade is clear, notification by the customer is swift, and the impact on all affected parties has been considered and weighed.
We understand you may have questions related to this trade reversal, and encourage you to write us with any questions or concerns you may have.
Gemini Support

Changetip or Coinbase

How will this help Bitcoin and/or ethereum ? I own both BTC and ETH so don't jump me, just trying to understand the concept.

I just bought a Ledger Unplugged for this exact reason. It's cheap IMO and extra protection for your mobile wallet.

Price goes up and miners make the same $$$ with TX fees or the lower block reward. /close thread

99% of Bitcoin supply is held by 1% of its users. 
The Gemini spike was either 
A. very little liquidity (typo/misclick) 
B. A marketing trick.

Online or brick and mortar business?
@_date: 2015-11-14 14:14:38
Coinbase mentions 11/20 as the delivery date for todays buys with a 3D VISA but it's an instant buy for me. Never tried Circle to be honest.
@_date: 2015-11-10 11:46:03
That would need to be done through Bitcoin QT right ?
@_date: 2015-11-10 17:35:12
Thank you everyone for the help I will try this method as it seems the easiest
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:45:05
Coinbase ?
@_date: 2015-11-12 22:13:46
Unless more TXs occur..
