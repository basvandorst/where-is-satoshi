Finally a neat looking portfolio app that allows for export / import.
Wanted to make one myself as well but I think your app has everything I wanted.

You can use veracrypt to create an encrypted file container with a password of your choosing and mount them in a similar manner to virtual DVD drives.
Upload file container to cloud service and never lose your private keys/f2a keys/passphrases etc again.
Your're fucked if you lose your master password, tho. It should be long and contain many different characters.

Nah, they need to satisfy their control fetish.

That list is in dire need of an update soon considering all the bs you hear from the dinosaurs.

God damnit. That fucking comment section.
It's hilarious, infuriating and saddening at once. They are comparing this market with completely different stuff in an absolutely absurd way.
You are comparing a cryptocurreny with fucking tulips from a market in 1600s? Really? Are you really that dense? 
But printing money 24/7 with ever increasing debt is probably totally OK, right? These people don't seem to understand that this is the chance to free ourselves from central banks. 
But there is one thing that makes me irrationally angry. Bashing/Praising something without understanding the mechanisms of said system. Not even trying or wanting to understand it.
Good lord, I can't wait to see the reactions of all doubters in a few years.

Agreed. I'm a retard hodler. Never again. 
Can we turn back time to December with retaining my gained experience, please?
Take profits, people...

I don't. I think it's healthy to keep the mind free and empty sometimes.

My parents still don't really get that cryptocurreny is going to be big. 
They initially thought I was putting my hard earned money into some scam and don't get the necessity for so many currencies. 
However, since I showed them that I doubled my investments as of yesterday after about 3 months they are slowly starting to develop interest.

Meh, it's just another buying opportunity for me with all those cheap alts.

Haven't seen that one in quite some time.
Already forgot this meme even exists.

I don't want to overthrow the government.
I just want central banking and fractional reserve to die a miserable death.

If I had a time machine the first thing I would do is not to buy btc but to beat past me to shreds.... and then buy btc for him.

I actually bought several times between $6k-$7k this week. Why would you sell at those cheap prices wtf.

Because laws don't count the same way for us as for the rich and powerful.
