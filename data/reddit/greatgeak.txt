I too find it interesting, one of their articles say Dogecoin is to enable" merge-mining" with Litcoin. Even though it's actually enabling Aux-PoW and the devs explained quite clearly why the term "merge-mining" is inaccurate.
I could understand some random joe making the mistake, but a supposed journalist?

I honestly can see a lot of businesses just turning NYS down. There seems to be no indication of size, what if it's a super small digital currency business, that has not the manpower to do as necessary for NYS.
Yes that's a loss for the business, but it's a necessary loss until they can get up in size and manpower to allow for such legislation.
Even then the requirement of 10 years of paperwork would ultimately require that the business be of decent size for 10 years time, no? Because they would have had to accrue 10 years of documented paperwork.
As an example, Google was incorporated in only 1998, if they were to have dealt primarily in Digital Currency (obviously they don't, but as a hypothetical example), they would have to ultimately wait to have the paperwork so as to comply with NYS....or is it simply that when registering with NYS, you from then on out, have to make a point to accrue 10 years of transaction data?

Why does this seriously freak me out a little.
What law did they invoke to deam it "Abandoned Property"? Especially if she'd continued to pay for it as normal (which I can only assume she did).
ISN'T THAT THE POINT OF A SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX?!
