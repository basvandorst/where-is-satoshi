After further thought, I need to clarify something.  Theoretically, 100% of the stolen coins could be returned if they had not been sold for fiat.  If some were sold, then there will be legitimate folks who own previously stolen BTC -- and you could not take those coins from those folks who legitimately purchased the stolen coins.  Any of the BTC that were not "cashed out" could be returned to the rightful wallets.

To think that the US government is pro-bitcoin is a little bit naive.  There has been a power struggle between the world currencies for dominance.  They don't want to let another player into the game. No matter what they say.  BTC threatens the value of the USD, and that threatens the US government.

But I really doubt it is a lost private key or a stolen amount of 750kBTC.  I think it's government intervention that has them backed into a corner.

Well that's the definition of holding a cold wallet, isn't it? They obviously have multiple wallets, so it would be smart to split large holdings of BTC across a couple of wallets to keep from putting all the eggs in one basket.  The reason why they weren't allowing BTC withdrawal had to do with either government intervention or had to do with MK wanting to make sure everyone of his customers got a fair shake once they realized the TM issue.  They didn't want to allow BTC withdrawal of stolen coins and wanted to do the due diligence to make sure that didn't happen.
I don't have any skin in the game at Gox, but I would definitely love it for the folks that do if this can be sorted out amicably and fairly.
Edit: why the downvotes?  Is it because MK is public enemy  and I was speculating that he might have been doing this for the good of the folks on his exchange?

If they had claimed they were running a fractional reserve, they would have lost all confidence and cement their inability to be resurrected.
The government would not comment on an ongoing investigation.  And if you think about it, the top governments of the world (AND private entities handling credit/debit transactions) do NOT want BTC to thrive.  So they wouldn't say anything.

Well it could be that Gox is under an order to halt any transfer of BTC from those wallets, and if they move any they will be arrested...  Without a doubt, Gox has (or will have) the majority of their BTC after things are no longer "temporarily unavailable."  They may have lost some small % of coins to the TM issue, but that is probably insignificant.  It is obvious that MK is powerless right now and is waiting on SOMETHING to happen before he can have his power back.  Whatever that "something" is, I don't know for a fact, but I would guess that it relates to a government.

Well, that definitely seems plausible.  However that doesn't really work when you apply Occam's Razor...

But that's a hell of a theory you got there.

What other expense do node operators face?  Disk storage?  No.
CPU time?  Yes, but even less without recursive signature checking on tx's with large  of inputs.  
Hash the main chain to the most previous block height minus 15 blocks, and include it in the coinbase transaction as well...  Nodes would then only have to store the last 50 blocks at most.
What am I missing?
@_date: 2017-01-18 18:27:41
Finally, someone who understands!  Thank you!  
I am an "oldschool" developer, and I would be more than willing to help in your endeavor to enable a lightweight client to bring more availability to the p2p network.  
@_date: 2017-01-18 00:45:48




Sounds like a good way to not get fucked, thanks
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:19:45
The consequences are that your node would now be stuck on a HF that doesn't grow.  Meanwhile, difficulty will continue upward, keeping your HF at bay.  (Or, difficulty could be calculated from the VALID chain that has no mining power, thereby pushing difficulty to 0 - and creating 1 second blocks.)  
Thus, nodes are powerless for validation if they don't have mining power backing them.  Transactions would come to a complete halt in the valid chain, and you'd be placed in a position to adopt the invalid chain or else have a stale system.
@_date: 2017-01-13 16:42:53
Correct.  But they have nothing to do with transaction fees, SegWit, BitFit, HashFoot, or BootLick.  They just simply run a piece of software.  I've had a dedicated node at my house and at my office for nearly 2.5 years.
I'm all for providing incentive to node operators...  But you can't give the node operators any of the transaction fees in the post-inflation era.
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:10:06
We're mainly just concerned with how you guys are going to stifle growth of the blockchain by some desire to fit the world into a 10 minute megabyte.  
You need lightweight nodes for p2p high-availability, and you need full-nodes for validation.  You're wondering why nodes are falling off... It's because non-tech folks can get BTC Core to run on their machine -- with the problem increasing by the moment.
The blockchain requires an "archive" of sorts, whereby the archival procedures occur, UTXO's from old blocks are moved forward into the new "archive" block, so that archived blocks do not contain any UTXO.
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:20:13
Except that they ensure the p2p network is highly available.  
Remind me how full nodes see any invalidity in the most recent block and prevent it from being added to the main chain.
@_date: 2017-01-17 23:44:37




@_date: 2017-01-17 14:26:54
He's worse than wrong.  He's 14-year old wrong.  Hash the main chain to the block height minus 15 blocks or so.  Bitcoin core only has to download the last 15 blocks
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:04:12
If there is a consensus among nodes that a block added to the top height of the main chain is invalid, but all miners say that it IS valid and continue mining using that block's previous hash, then you end up with an invalid block in the main chain.  Nodes are forced to recognize the invalid block or else recognize a fork that doesn't grow.  Nodes have no validation power if they are not backed by mining power.
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:55:37
If the miners were to continue their own work on an invalid chain, and users can't get confirmed on the actual valid chain, users will value the invalid chain.  
There is no time to pause and pull out an array of GPU units and bring them online.  Especially after widescale adoption.
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:51:22
Is someone joining the ecosystem if they're not running a full node, or are they simply becoming a user of Bitcoin?  I think you have to separate the two ideas.  
With steady growth rates, it will take Bitcoin Core 6 months to synchronize less than five years from now -- on any piece of hardware.  
This creates the need for a lightweight p2p client that those who are simply becoming "users" can also actually join the ecosystem and assist the p2p network.
@_date: 2017-01-20 01:16:40
They don't know that, and in fact, it's ridiculous to say that the coins are lost forever.  Also, apparently people don't understand what market capital means.
@_date: 2017-01-18 18:33:04
The TA is not BS by any means.  Markets follow Fib/fractal retracement, all day, every day.  While the original sell-off occurred on news from China, the bottom was found via TA and the retrace was predictable via TA.  
The TA was likely BS a while back, and was not necessarily witnessed prior to big time investors being involved.  As more big investors get skin in the game, the more you can look to the technical analysis for movements and break-out signals.

@_date: 2017-01-17 15:13:56
There is no mechanism for a node to fail a signature verification with any affect.  
On top of that, there is no need for a node that simply enables p2p to verify signatures.  And the p2p node count is what is in jeopardy.  
Perhaps node counts are dropping because it takes 40 days and nights to get core running.
Create lightweight p2p "node" software that only enables communications, and then you'll see node counts rise.
@_date: 2017-01-19 00:14:07
You can't get 95% consensus with 40% of the ecosystem being "lazy" folks that have not updated their software.  SegWit is a non-starter.  But that probably has nothing to do with the elitist attitude of r/bitcoin and more to do with how "lazy" people are.
@_date: 2017-01-13 17:22:30
You're suggesting that the network is currently in trouble due to a lack of nodes.  That's an unfounded fear.  
That's because, if there should ever be an issue with a lack of nodes, those who are most invested in the success of Bitcoin will have to come off of some stacks of cash to increase node counts - or risk losing it all.
That's the free market at work.  And it does work.
SegWit doesn't help node operators with regard to syncing time, disk space, etc., so you must ask yourself the question: if core devs are not interested in the things you are, are you interested in the right things?
@_date: 2017-01-13 04:02:33
Sorry, but you didn't grasp what I said.  Freeing up block space, as in a 1MB arbitrary limit, is a total bandaid to fix a true scaling problem that Bitcoin faces down.  
Removing the computation time from recursive signature checking is a smart thing to do.
But what is going to happen will be the following:
* The mempool will basically always be empty
* The first miner to solve a block with a "full" mempool will include MOST of the transactions in the mempool, thereby granting that miner the grand majority of tx fees available in the pool
* After the block reward runs out, miners will have no incentive to mine, because they know that if they don't get the first block after any separation of time between it and the last block, they'll get NOTHING but an electricity bill
This scenario causes the potential for a mining monopoly.  That alone will doom the technology.  
There will be no problem until the end of inflation, but after that, you'll see miners either consolidate or shut down.  The smaller mining groups will be bought out or have to flee the scene entirely.  
The only motivation for miners to do work in the post-inflation era will be an opportunity for them to be granted transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-01-13 16:09:28
What do node operators have to do with this?
@_date: 2017-01-13 08:46:10
I'd say that the blockchain is currently sub-optimal.  I'll probably always say that, because I always think software can be made better.  
Therefore, you can't state outright that any given proposal is a sub-optimal solution without 1) consideration or 2) implementation.  
The responses to this issue are almost as insufferable as the rest of Reddit.  No one single person knows best.  And in cases of subjectivity, you must defer to the free market.  
Further scaling WILL require the block size restriction to be raised or removed entirely.  And that's because you can't fit the world into a 10 minute megabyte.
You can't solve a scaling issue by cherry-picking elements of core functionality  to place into new off-chain components just for the sake of remaining fenced in by the original author's boundary.  It's not a bad idea to have off-chain elements -- in fact, it's the natural evolution of the blockchain.  But perhaps not for the sake of paying homage to an old, uncommented commit of the code.
If you don't think the blockchain needs to be able to scale beyond 32k transactions per 10 minutes, you're not thinking big enough.  It will likely need to handle millions of transactions per block.
The blockchain has already hit the self-imposed wall, and I'm reminded of that every time I find myself waiting to be included in a block - or when I look at the exchange rate of my transaction fee.  
Making a truly scalable block size will work best sooner than later, because it will be much easier to work out any kinks in 2017 than in 2027.  But, in letting go of the equivalent of 1992's 5.25" high density floppy disk, there will obviously have to be some stress testing.
I'm not suggesting anyone go and willy-nilly a solution.  I'm just saying that it is totally ridiculous to even consider "block size" in units of storage.  It should be measured in units that represent the transaction load.  To think of it as a disk space issue simply doesn't make sense.  Just consider how horrible it gets when the mempool is at 20k - and consider how bad it would be at 20 million.
The transactions' sizes don't make Bitcoin.  It's only the transactions themselves that matter.
SegWit has some great features and offers itself as a great building block for the system.  But it does not address the post-inflation era, which will be here before we know it.
SegWit, in its current incarnation, will ultimately put the transaction fee market into the hands of a few miners, and they will eventually keep you sidelined in the mempool until you decide to pay their tax.  
Perhaps a scalable max transaction fee could be implemented.  
The future holds the promise that either 1) mining operations consolidate or 2) Bitcoin isn't a thing.  Consolidation naturally occurs because it is more profitable to buy out the competition than to compete with them.  
The lack of a well defined decision is either  or  in the Think and Grow Rich book.  And it applies here.  It's better to make the wrong decision and correct it than to be in a stasis - wondering what if, what if, what if.
@_date: 2017-01-13 02:18:42
Implement SegWit.  It makes sense.  But what doesn't make sense is waiting 40 minutes for one single confirmation on a tx.  And since SegWit does not directly address that issue, do not view SegWit as the "fix" for speeding up the blockchain.
The max block size issue should not be about the max block size, at all.  It should scale dynamically with the size of the mempool.  "Max block size" should actually be viewed as "max # transactions per block" instead.  This max value could be calculated similar to difficulty, but tackled completely different - in "real time" as blocks are mined.
More people waiting "in line" to get a confirmation?  Sure, they can pay more for quicker confirmation, though, as we approach the end of BTC's inflation, fees are going to go up, up, up as miners will be put squarely in control of what transactions get a confirmation or not.  This means that the miners will have total control of the fee market.  That's not good.
My suggestion would be to remove the block size restriction entirely, and then:
* Average size of mempool = an exponential moving average of the mempool size, derived when nonce is 0, as seen by the miner.  This number would be recorded simultaneously with the base block data for the block that's set to be worked on.  The value should probably be included in the coinbase tx of the block to avoid any forking.  A block should be rejected if its "average size of mempool" number deviates more than 1/6th of the current average size of the mempool minus the number of transactions in the last block, up or down, considering 6 blocks per hour.  This would give the blockchain power to immediately scale confirmation time as mempool volume increases or decreases (but, with restrictions!) 
* Factor = (Last block's "average size of mempool" value - # transactions in the last block) * (1/6)
* Factor(max) = (Factor * 1) + last block's average size of mempool
* Factor(min) = (Factor * -1) + last block's average size of mempool
* Max # transactions per block = Average size of mempool / Factor(max)
* Min # transactions per block = Average size of mempool / Factor(min)
* If the miner's "average size of mempool" is calculated higher or lower than the max or min, the max or min must be used.
* If the Factor(min) value is lower than zero, zero would be used.
With a "min # transactions" in place, the miners must mine what's there, regardless of what tx fees are available for the taking.  A transaction with fee of 0.00000001 would definitely still wait longer than one with a 0.001 fee in this case...  But this puts the fee market in the hands of the consumer.
Waiting 40 minutes for one confirmation is absolutely ridiculous.  It's UNUSABLE.

I think you're doing it right.
@_date: 2017-04-20 01:24:11
I guess I'm resistant to go with core because I am a developer by trade and have been doing this a long time.... And the blocksize limit fiasco really, really, really turned me off.  It's like people forgot how to perform commits or they were too gun-shy to make the change which is actually perfectly predictable.
I do appreciate your response.  
I also did not like core's presentation of the off-chain technology.  It seems premature when there are other problems.  
If you think this through, and I mean like 80-100 to maybe even 500 years into the future...  You MUST reward the nodes with transaction fees or else the network will be monopolized and always at risk for the 51% attack.  The bottom line is that the miners will ensure the network remains operational no matter what - it's how they make their money.  And if there is no incentive to reward private nodes the way that it works now and MUST always work, you run into a mess of people not running bitcoind (or assorted flavor)
It's an interesting challenge but I have brought this up over and over and I know that everyone says "that was discussed 5 years ago" and I guess my answer is that it may have been discussed five years ago but the wrong conclusions were made.  The situation has evolved.  In a good way.  Adapt.

I've used Paxful numerous, numerous times.  Hell I think I have more feedback there than my 17 year old ebay account.  Just pick a reputable seller. 99% is nothing to sweat over.  They can be picky the first time you buy, and most will limit you on your first 7 days or so - a particular vendor may only let you buy so much before they allow a grace period to pass.  Good luck.
After Coinbase raised my limits, I've had no need to use Paxful or LBC.  They collect far too much premium - cash deposit even has a healthy premium from most vendors.  But once you establish a relationship with a seller, they will no longer make you go through the hassle of a photo holding your driver's license saying "BTC Souvenir Purchase" -- lol
