I wouldn't call that a dip. In 2013 BTC crashed and went bear for a while.

Wealth is about enjoying yourself, not looking at digits on a screen.

Hope you got high at least.

I had 1.5 BTC and then it hit $1100 in January this year so I sold it out of excitement. Got about $1600 for my 1.5.
Now I hate myself.

I bought a little last night thinking welp, there goes my money.
But this trajectory is giving me way too much confidence now.

You buy it

2x rent for many.

If you're being nervous at these dips, you're too emotionally attached to your investment.
[Meanwhile my attitude](
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:16:45
Same. I keep thinking about the bitcoins I had back then and converting their value now. I need to stop that.
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:16:57
By then, I'll buy
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:58:23
Take price you paid and divide it by bitcoins acquired?
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:06:05
I wish I had HODL
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:15:49
OMG BTC IS FAILING
