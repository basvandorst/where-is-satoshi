You're talking about "transactions"   
I would talk about "blocks", as you probably already know, the transaction itself is not going to broadcast.  
@_date: 2018-09-27 08:52:14
I could have done it with any amount.
@_date: 2018-09-27 10:49:25
he's talking about the attack on mainnet.
@_date: 2018-09-27 09:12:21
It took less than an hour to understand the CVE and write a POC.
@_date: 2018-09-27 15:24:46
In \_this\_ case the transaction is going to be included by the malicious miner (me, this time) without being sent to other nodes, as it would be rejected even by old versions.
@_date: 2018-09-27 15:28:35
"Attacker" here :-)  
   
Yes, it was just testing.
@_date: 2018-09-27 19:19:18
Not only dishonest.
I would say that a wrong implementation of an "accelerate transactions" API, one that add transactions on top of the queue by proxying on the getblocktemplate RPC (as I did for my test) may be exploitable as well, unless prior verification on the sendrawtransaction API (signrawtransaction, which someone use to verify transactions correctness, was affected too).
But I don't know how those services, the few I've seen in the field, works.

your assumption.
reality is bitpay employers starred double spend tools
@_date: 2014-11-28 09:31:18
Thanks God we'll have instant transactions on Robocoin, finally. till today I had to wait ~60 minutes to cash out bitcoins... oh cmon.
Good job!

I would love to resell chaturbate tokens, buying them wholesale and then reselling for Bitcoins.
Could we talk about this ? Is implemented a public method to transfers token from an account to another ?
Thank you,

thanks, I'll remember

you're right, sorry and thank you, corrected.

I don't want to open reddit to know what the hell is going on. There's the 'news' section on the official website, for that things.
For the records: I love how Stamp handled the TX malleability issue, they did a great job, but every step outside the right path, here, is a threat to the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.  Writing a statement is a five minute job. Since this issue is affecting much users here, write it.
@_date: 2014-04-14 09:04:47
They simply can't, your mnemonic phrase and private keys aren't sent on the internet.
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:22:34
I guess it's because private money could be seen as a treath in the US. (google Liberty Dollars)
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:48:28
Locked users, did you logged on Stamp from a Tor exit node or something like that?  
Just trying to understand how they chose which users to block and which not.
@_date: 2014-03-08 09:29:16
 Dorian approved.
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:58:36
yeah, "cool", next time release a statement to explain what's going on, before locking accounts.
holy crap, you're messing with our money.
@_date: 2019-03-11 14:20:56
Hey! Thanks for the interest.
Stadicus wrote a great guide a bit ago, it's still valid :-)

You can't be sure.   
Build your own.

0-conf is a transaction that you, on your ecommerce/cash register/whatever, account as "credited" at the moment you receive it.
whatever you will do with it in the future.
