I have the same story. Been six weeks now! There is no way to add to the transaction fee as it is been done already and set as final. So there is one input-one-output, six times. All same, six transactions to the same address each has different fee which is lowest 30 sat/B. From certain address, which for dozen of transactions been made years ago, I decided to move remaining coins. So I wonder, how long I should wait until this will be refused by network and will be sent back to me. No way to double spent it even, as Electrum (dedicated to this matter only) shows no records in coins. Ideas?

Good time to buy more!

HODL! And the reason is the year 2018, which as many believe, will be the “fattest” for cryptos.

Wold of VISA or world of coinbase?

I wonder what is procedure?..  I have stuck 6 transactions since Dec.26 - still unconfirmed, the fee set as “final”. Right - the fee is low, but return me back my coins! Network, WTF?!

Platform’s fee = 1%, which pays BTC seller; After WestCrest’s failure with VISAs, back on trading on LB again...

Bollox. I care, coz I had VISA linked to Coinsbank and held there BTC only. Once doing POS transaction, the instant trade happens and my VISA is credited with fiat to cover the purchase. So I could say - i USE (did use, using VISA) BTC for a daily payments (not just holdling or speculating on it value!); So I care, coz it did work for me. It was easy, useful, inexpensive (only BTC accounts top-up costs the tx.fee, not the POS payments or conversions);
If not VISA, then hopefully MasterCard might come with updated options, though with crypto-tax-regulations, which seems will be applied quite a worldwide during this year, this might be tough task or even impossible. As I am pretty sure, crypto-POS would not come soon to daily (or little) supermarkets, which most by now having card-processors.

My neighbor, who in panic have sold the most (purchased btc’s a few month ago for few k’s), gave me an analytical lecture, (as he saying, based on his experience on watching the charts of certain stocks) that BTC will reach the deep of 3k or even 1.5k. I promised to buy him a red sponge clown nose, hearing this..

The only chance to take your wallet file and try to brutforce it (all privates are encrypted by password you’ve chosen), taking it in to possibilities your password could be made of - numbers, lower-UPPER, $P3C14L5?, length range etc.   or simply keep trying...  or keep it until the day will come you will be able to unlock it, when it would worth to hire smbd who could help possibly?.. Good luck. But yes, it is possible.

Bollox. The man would ask it years ago and probably this would be solved by now if real. Out of blue, 180+ btc are still resting in comp with dodgy os not reading hdd?!

In what time-frame? In long term - extremely unlikely.  In short term - see how lucky you’ll be to buy the dip (which not yet sure, but might be already over) - keep your eyes opened and stop panicking. The best practice - hodl.
Sorry not adding the reason, but it simply too obvious - the reason is BTC and the way it is designed.
Sounds like you are very recent BTC holder? First time experience of such “crashes”? No worries.

Thanks for bringing to cryptos a new member! 
Today I’ve convinced my friend to receive my 100$ debt in to cryptos and it was accepted! So 1++
Suggested Samourai Wallet for AndroidOS, because it supports SegWit.

Lucky you! Did you ever try to CLOSE the bank account? 
In my case, it took 2 months to close my bank accounts (because Mr.Taxman looses the possibility to suck my money!). It takes 2 minutes to open a new one, but nothing similar v.v. So, from certain angle of view - this is good advise to those who want to do it quick with Citybank..

"Since all blockchain data is downloaded and persistently stored by users, they are liable for any objectionable content added to the blockchain by others. Consequently, it would be illegal to participate in a blockchain-based system as soon as it contains illegal content," the paper states.
Scary statement, but hold on... is it quite similar to: if USD cash is widely used for illegal activities, does this makes me a criminal only because USDs were found in my pocket? I truly believe, USD is the most popular currency which supports terrorism and war-trades, however how this fact makes me, holder of USD become a criminal? How do I know, the single USD note which I have, been or not ever used for: rolling a tube for coca line, porn, buying explosives, has been used in Syria, been used for wiping ass, or even worse!

You already do! and feels you do right thing - you talk, you say, you investigate, you let us know the scammer is there awaiting for a next pray, you REMIND US to triple-check everything before transacting funds, and in general to be conscious and still bit paranoid (just in case / no shame...); 
Onces I was scammed for round sum, and the best support from friend of mine has come with the question/suggestion - wen he asked me: “OK, first count your toes....”.  ... ?! [wtf?! they are all in place..]  ... “fine, now let’s talk about your PROBLEM”.. 
Things happen dude, you are not the only one victim here. I can not suggest anything on getting back your funds, but moral support only. You remind us one thing, I’d like to remind another - is many cases (if you are not moron) Life gives back. Takes. Gives. No bother why - it is just the way “designed”, as to same similar - there’s no bad which won’t come for good. So if the reason is there, better let it be as is, than it could be something much more terrible, where you’d “pay” your 70k one or another way. My way of thinking.. based on 42y observation of Life principles.

Anything coming for iOS?

Do not worry. Sounds like an app bug. Have seen very similar glitch on other wallet.app. If there is nothing appears on blockchain explorers, most likely your tx has not been sent at all. Try another wallet (say Mycelium) and recreate your ledger from the seed. You should see it all in tact. If so - reinstall Samourai, seed the ledger, see if is OK.

Yes it is forked from BictoinCash fork and you can claim your forked BNW coins on April 1st!

Haven’t done the proper research on that, but if more data could be passed through higher frequencies, then I presume those should be 20kHz+, to avoid an annoying, ear drilling whizzzzz of transferred data.. (“used” human ear are not able to hear above 20kHz).  So now depends if your gadget hardware (mic in this case) is able to pick the precision of such FQs..

This is for ^24 word seed. Will ^12 take twice quicker? :D
Good idea is to enhance your BIP.39 seed with few more, custom words, then it should take something like 10^108 - no chance even for *God* to bruteforce it..

In 2024 the value of $0.07 will be worth a penny. The calculations above are correct!
