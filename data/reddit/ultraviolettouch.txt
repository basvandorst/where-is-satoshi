Thank you. I hate Ver and BCH because of the noxious garbage on r/btc . It's so disgusting.  Let each one survive on their own merit. I'm still Hodling for the fork.  These groups need to stop fighting and support each other or at least leave each other alone.  It's ridiculous

I wouldn't make the same decision (would try to make the profit make more money for me somehow) but I don't see why everyone needs to shit on this person's decision. They've made money. Investment was a success. Why question their choice?

Whey is watery but the curds are fat and proteins. Cheese is made from the curds, not the whey. The whey is discarded

Nakamoto ain't that photo

Yay someone not being emotional about this

The price is based on what people believed it's worth so now their futures are just near worthless through perception. Strange it's at 200 though

You can buy in person at a Bitcoin meetup

Lolol physics much?

This comment doesn't make sense to me. Are there even any b2x coins?? It was never forked and therefore they were never created

Nakamoto loves some cocoa

Just don't put all of your money in btc unless you don't mind losing it all

?? Day trading is hard! Not sure you're doing it right. Most don't because humans in general are bad at it

This made me laugh so much. Thank you! xD

I find it amusing discussions of cheese production and composition are happening here. There's also been much discussion of the Moon and water being there and somewhere else we're talking about American vs metric cooking measurements.
All extremely relevant to Bitcoin

The "welfare state" is the shockingly smaller expense in those two.  Military spending is no 1.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:21:29
Isn't that all governments?

Weight? Use a scale. I get confused with liters and milliliters etc personally. But that's only cause I'm not used to them
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:30:31
Yes if you're american
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:00:25
Wish I could blame all our problems on the military
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:41:45
Agreed. It's kinda gross

Yogurt isn't cheese. Yes you got me with ricotta! The fresh cheeses are different

Cool. Yep. I was wrong. I actually tried to delete my comment once I realized I was mistaken. But apparently the delete didn't go through

This was probably a guy shorting, not losing! :)
