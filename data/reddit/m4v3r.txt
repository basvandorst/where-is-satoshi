The trading part works the same way as localbitcoins do. What we add on top of that is a safe storage for Bitcoins, since we all know that exchanges lose money all the time. In Bitalo it's not possible for us to lose or steal your funds.

Maciej from Bitalo here. You probably misunderstood the feature. We don't want to connect to your bank account and we never ask for your bank account credentials or access. All you have to do is enter your bank account number so we can send you a small payment with a verification code attached to it. This is only so you can verify your identity with us so we can comply with AML regulations.

We use 2-of-2 multisig addresses. At this moment you can prevent address reuse by creating more wallets at Bitalo (you can create as many as you want). We are looking into integrating HD wallets, as we have one person experienced in that topic in our team.
@_date: 2014-04-07 07:13:10
Of course they do. They can run with your money at any time. Or be hacked and lose it all in a moment. Doing a Bitcoin wallet nowadays with no multisig is just irresponsible IMO.
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:15:47
We would love to add other crypto-currencies, but I believe that at this moment they don't support multisig wallets yet, so that's a bummer. We're looking into it, though!
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:14:02
Any questions you might have regarding Bitalo or multisignature addresses in general, I'll gladly answer.
A quick writeup: Bitalo is a first online wallet utilizing multisignature wallets, in which we don't have full control over your Bitcoins. Also, the exchange part is done in a peer to peer fashion - you send fiat directly to Bitcoin seller, and we are just an escrow for the time of trade.
Oh, and the address is:

The best thing is that all wallet handling is done in Javascript. The source is out there right in your browser. It's not minified and we've left all the comments. Everyone can audit it themselves.
@_date: 2014-02-22 13:20:11
Trading is done in two phases. From Bitcoin seller's point of view:
- when a trade is initiated, you have to "approve" it by entering your password, which unlocks the private key and signs (in your browser) a transaction to "split" you Bitcoins in two parts - one with the exact amount needed for the transaction, and the other which is rest of your funds. This transaction goes to yourself, and we internally mark the first one as "spent" so you cannot sell it again.
- when you receive fiat, you then "confirm" the trade by releasing the Bitcoins to the buyer (to his multi signature wallet). Here, again, you have to enter your password to sign the Bitcoin transaction that will make that happen.
This way money never leaves safe multi signature wallets, so even if Bitalo servers are compromised, hackers will gain nothing, because not a single satoshi is stored in there. Even trading fees go directly to a multi signature wallet owned by Bitalo management board.

It's a fair point, though this video was meant also to be watched by people new to Bitcoin. Feel free to skip to about 0:50 in the video :).
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:58:43
There already is one exchange that does exactly this: 
We use multi signature wallets, thus all Bitcoins are visible on the blockchain and there is no way we could do fractional reserve. There is also no way we could run with user funds. The exchange part is also done in multisignature fashion, so Bitcoins never leave safe wallets. [On this page]( you can get more information about how we achieve this.
@_date: 2014-03-18 08:37:37
So they don't have any address validation in their withdrawal form? Wow.
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:28:10
We don't, that's the whole point. We only handle Bitcoins in escrow, you are expected to send fiat directly to the seller's bank account. It means that to buy Bitcoins you don't have to deposit fiat anywhere before you start buying - you just have to pick offer that suits you, send fiat to the seller, he confirms and voila - Bitcoins on your address.
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:30:20
See my other answer :). There are three wallets involved:
- seller's 2-of-2 multisig wallet (both seller and Bitalo has to sign the transaction)
- buyer's wallet (could be also a 2-of-2 multisig wallet on Bitalo, but it's not mandatory)
- Bitalo's multisig wallet (to which the "refund" transaction sends to after two weeks if there is a dispute)
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:43:49
Your private key alone is useless in multisignature scheme. Even if you lose private key on your computer, a thief would still be unable to withdraw your funds without the second private key that Bitalo holds. And he still wouldn't be able to create a withdrawal request on Bitalo without your mobile with MePIN 2-factor app installed on it that authorizes all transfers.
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:27:27
In the beginning Bitcoins sits on a multi signature 2-of-2 wallet that belongs to seller and Bitalo. Both sigs are needed to move them further. The "split" transaction doesn't move them anywhere - it's sending them back to the same 2-of-2 wallet, so still both seller and Bitalo are needed to spend them. What this transaction achieves is that it creates a Bitcoin output with an amount exactly matching the one that buyer wants. We then in our internal accounting set status of this output as "frozen", so the seller cannot do anything with it until either he decides to release it to the buyer, or, after 2 weeks, we claim it and then decide what to do.
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:36:08
Its in development for over a year: 
It was publicized only recently when author decided to live entirely off its development.

I've downloaded both PDF's and they seem to be the same. Maybe you did mess up with the links?
@_date: 2014-03-02 20:18:04


We just hold the escrow (i.e. prevent the seller to move coins, we still don't control them fully thanks to the multisig wallets) until both sides agree that its okay to release them.


Even though there is a default field for entering your bank account details, it is up to both seller and buyer how they will transfer fiat. For all intents and purposes it could be done face to face as well.


It is resolved on a per-case basis. Because we don't disclose email addresses of both parties to themselves, all communications go through us, so we have insight of what was going on. If buyer sends us enough evidence that he actually did send money and the seller disagrees, after predefined amount of time we use a "lock time" transaction that was signed by the seller before to recover the coins and send them to the buyer. 
Dealing with payment cancellations is a tough one, for that reason we encourage to use bank transfers, which are in general not easily reversible. If that happens anyway, all we can do is block this user from further trading.
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:07:50
2-factor, strong password AND [multisignature wallets]( That's the way to go.
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:23:44
No, as I said, the lock time transaction is not sent to the network, before it's needed (and the two-week period passes). If both sides agree and seller confirms sending the fiat, buyer gets his coins and lock time transaction is no longer valid. Buyer can then spend/withdraw the coins immediately

Every year this figure is around few hundred million USD. So while Bitcoin thefts are painful, they are hardly something new in finance world. Where there's money, there will be thieves, period. Bitcoin has the advantage though, that with proper technology we can minimize the risks. You can't secure your dollars that much (without spending a fortune on security).

The same could be achieved with lock time transactions, and we will probably implement that in the future.
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:17:30
This is actually an interesting idea about why this happened. It could be that there is a bug in RC2 that prevents some transactions from being relayed. I'm wondering what's the client version coverage for the network at this moment. Anywhere I can find this data?

If we wouldn't release it, you wouldn't be able to get it back - that's how multisignature wallets work. We don't have a reason NOT to release it though - there is no incentive not to do so. With only one private key we couldn't do anything to your coins.
Also, we are paranoid when it comes to DB backups. They are done every hour, encrypted with a GPG key that only board members and devs have, and sent offsite.

BTC-e actually IS vurnerable. Sometimes you have to check several times, because the exploit doesn't work in 100% of cases.
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:32:33
Correct. We utilize multisig wallets, lock time transactions, and peer to peer fiat exchange to create a safe environment for storing and trading coins. At no single point we receive on our servers your password or private keys.
We also use [MePIN]( for two-factor authentication, which is even more secure than your standard Google 2FA, while being more convenient (having to press a button on a notification instead of typing digits)
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:00:26
Great to see a response from you guys. Hope you will address this quickly!
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:17:57
And why the user would confirm 2fa request when he didn't initiate any transaction? Remember that we don't use your standard Google Authenticator here, we use MePIN which talks directly to your mobile device.

Not yet, but it's on our short term todo list


- Seller is instructed to sign in and click the "Approve" button. At this point buyer still doesn't have his bank details, so if buyer asks him to cancel the transaction for whatever reason, he can do it without any harm
- When he clicks the button, he has to enter his password, which is used as explained above - "split" transaction with two outputs is created - output A for the exact amount for the buyer (10 BTC), and output B which is change that goes back to his wallet. This transaction is sent to the Bitcoin network. Then a second "refund" transaction is drafted, taking output A and sending it to us, but with this "lock time" parameter. This is not sent to the network (because the protocol doesn't permit "lock time" transactions being sent to the network before the time expires) and stored in the DB.
- at this point buyer sees seller's bank details, so he has to pay in the 4500€
- when the seller receives payment, he hits "Confirm" button by which he confirms that he received money. He enters his password again, and now a transaction is made with the 10 BTC output A above being sent to buyers wallet. This transaction is sent to the network, which also invalidates the lock time transaction from above (because we spent output A here).
- buyer now has Bitcoins on his wallet, and seller has the fiat, and they lived happily ever after
That's in the nutshell how it works. Sounds complicated probably, but our UI hides all the complexity.
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:48:50
At this moment we take 0.2% from the amount sent from buyer to seller. Bitcoin transaction fees are deducted as well (about 0.0002 BTC per trade), but with the coming v0.9 it will be reduced ten-fold, so barely noticable. You can see the fee breakdown when creating an offer.
The secure wallet service is, and always will be free of charge.
@_date: 2014-03-25 13:24:48
I wonder why this was never finished. If implemented correctly, that would make many exchanges/marketplaces obsolete, and that would be a good thing, because it would had better security (no trusted thirdparty).
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:39:46
I happened to stumble upon few confused guys that had their transactions unconfirmed for longer than expected, and wanted to help them somehow. This has nothing to do with Bitalo, I did it in my spare time. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 23:06:46
The drawbacks are that you loose some privacy (people you trade with get to know your wallet addresses) and you have to pay transaction fees for every action (trading, moving between wallets). I think that security benefits greatly outweigh these drawbacks, though.
Since we're quite new (started only in december and just gaining grounds), we don't have an API yet. We'll sure let you know when we add one!
@_date: 2014-03-22 12:02:09
That's not a responsible disclosure. You should try to contact them first, and only inform the public if they for some reason refused to fix it. Doing it like you did here puts people's accounts in there at greater risk.
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:57:44
Bitcoin contains a feature that lets you create a transaction that can only be accepted by the network after certain time or block number. More specifically, there is a parameter in the transaction called nLockTime, which accepts either a unix timestamp (time) or a number less than 500000000 (block number).
We utilize this feature on Bitalo for buyer protection. When two offers are matched, a seller has to "approve" the transaction first with his account password. By doing this, he signs two transactions in his browser:
- first one is a "split" transaction - it makes sure that he ends up with a specific Bitcoin amount in his wallet that matches the amount of the offer. This transaction is then broadcasted to the network
- second one takes an output from this "split" transaction, and creates a transaction from that input to an address that Bitalo controls (a multisig address for which only the management board has private keys) and adds a "lock time" parameter for time two weeks in the future. Because of this parameter, the transaction cannot be broadcast to the network, and is instead stored in our database.
Should a conflict between seller and buyer rise and they don't solve it themselves, after two weeks when the lock time counter expires, we can claim the coins and investigate. Because all communication goes through Bitalo (users don't get their email addresses, they have to use our internal messaging system) we have the whole picture of how the transaction went. If the buyer provides a substantial proof that he did send the money to sellers account, we will give the Bitcoins back to him. Otherwise, they will be returned to the seller.
Note that this process can be altered slightly so no trust is put in Bitalo - instead of sending coins to us, they could be sent to a trusted member of Bitcoin community not related to Bitalo. If we create such agreement with someone, we will announce that.


Holding fiat in the future is not out of question. But for now we're happy to forfeit the whole day trading folk, there are still plenty of people who only want to occasionally buy and sell, that will be okay with a small delay. And for that purpose, Bitalo is actually faster. Consider that on "normal" exchanges you have withdraw your fiat to receive it on your bank account, which could take at least one day, and sometimes even longer. On Bitalo, if the buyer is already online and you share the same bank, the fiat transfer is often instant. I already made few trades like that - from the offer to fiat in my bank account in 5-10 minutes.
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:51:46
Also to the poster below:
MePIN allows us to talk directly to your mobile device, without your computer in the middle. That means that even at account setup, a hacker compromising your computer wouldn't be able to steal secret key that is used for two-factor, because it never reaches your computer. This is a big advantage over Google 2FA, which, with added benefit of accepting a push notification instead of managing keys and codes, made us to use MePIN over Google 2FA. MePIN also supports SMS 2-factor, which we will implement shortly.
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:20:39
Yep, I saw the post as well. 700 MB of leaked data. Now it's gone.
Edit: Here are the details: 
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:08:16
I only mentioned Bitalo so no one accuses me I'm spreading FUD and covering who I am. That post wasn't meant to advertise a business, but to bring attention to an issue and possibly solve it. 
Blockchain.info being slow, and showing false data are two separate things. The former happened from time to time before and as you said, its forgivable given their volume. The latter is a pretty serious issue that just started to happen lately and needs to be addresses as soon as possible.
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:16:23
We protect buyers as well. When a transaction starts, seller has to sign a "refund transaction" which has a lock time parameter of 14 days in it. In the case seller doesn't release the coins even though the evidence points that the buyer paid in the money, the coins would be sent to address that Bitalo controls, and these would be then sent to the buyer.
On the other hand, if all goes well, the coins are moved directly to the buyer and then the refund transaction gets invalidated, because the inputs are already spent.
@_date: 2014-03-23 08:06:04
Is there any progress? 2 months is a LOT of time, surely they should have a prototype at least.
@_date: 2014-03-14 09:52:07
At [Bitalo]( we actually are doing something about it - instead of bragging how secure we are, we actually implemented a multisignature system that lets anyone verify that we actually ARE secure. So you don't have to take our word for it.
@_date: 2014-10-30 08:29:55
At [Bitalo]( we also use multi-signature wallets, but we use 2 of 2 keys, of which one belongs to us, and the second one to the user. This way even if user's key is leaked, he is still protected by 2-factor authentication. And we pay much attention to not leak 2FA key (we don't use Google 2FA as it is insecure in that regard).
@_date: 2014-10-31 15:40:26
I know all that, but as I've already explained in sibling comment, TOTP won't guard you when your system is compromised during account setup, because a malicious program can capture your TOTP key and use it later to generate 2FA tokens. No TOTP implementation can change that.
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:56:42
This is different. This transaction actually exists on Bitcoin network, but it's low priority because its almost 2000 bytes but pays no fee. You just have to wait for some generous miner that will include it in a block.

[Bitalo]( which launched last year, offers all this plus better 2FA (MePIN), backup transactions and an integrated exchange and mining pool. 
Plus we're currently having a referral program where you can earn about 75 mBTC for each person you refer to the service!

Oh God no :). Bitalo was created way before Mt.Gox started to have problems.

Here you go.
For explanation, see: 
@_date: 2014-02-15 07:17:33
Thats exactly what they did. Bitomat lost ~17000 BTC and Mt.Gox "bought" them, repaying all the debts for its users.
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:37:16
Almost correct, just notice one thing: 


S2 = S. This is the same wallet. This is done because in Bitcoin at the low level there is no such thing as "wallets" and "balances". It's more like coins in your physical wallet. You have 1 EUR coin and you want to split it into 60 and 40 cents. That's more or less what we're doing here - splitting one coin into two so we can get exact amount we want.
@_date: 2014-02-19 23:02:17
Because it's easiest to build a centralized exchange, and it's easiest to make money off it. Building truly decentralized software is hard, and making money off it is even harder.
At [Bitalo]( we are trying to find a good compromise between the two. We use multi signature wallets so you can track exactly what happens with your money, and we cannot touch it without you explicitly signing the transaction. Try it, maybe you'll like it.
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:09:16
User having both private keys would defeat the purpose of having multisignature wallets in the first place - that would centralize the risks on the user side. It would also make trading a lot more difficult, because we couldn't act as an escrow for the funds with that kind of system.
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:54:32
Yes, but it uses only one key, which can be stolen directly from your computer when you interact with your Blockchain.info account, since the wallet and transaction handling is done in your browser. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 10:28:29
You can try to buy Bitcoins for Euro directly from a real person with a safe escrow at [Bitalo](

The exchange probably got hacked, but there's no official info from the operators yet. They have a topic on a polish Bitcoin forums, I'll update the post when there's some more info.
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:30:51
I had a Bitcoin exchange in 2011 and in my infinite stupidity I stored most of the "cold" wallet coins on Bitcoinica, which got hacked and then closed. People that founded Bitalo actually had some of the bigger balances in there, so let's say I'm paying off my debt to them. Also, I pay most of the money I earn from them directly to other people that had account's there, until everyone is settled, keeping only a small amount to myself to pay my bills.
Also, now you can see what was the incentive to create Bitalo - a service where you don't have to trust even the site administrators. Even though I'm not proud of my previous actions, I'm proud that we managed to release this service so that will never happen again.
@_date: 2014-03-02 20:27:55
Yes, we did, and it's on our todo list, though it requires some careful planning first. We'll definitely announce when it's completed.
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:36:55
It was due a bug in blockchain.info wallet which failed to send the transaction to the network. So only Blockchain.info knew about this transaction, and only recently someone re-broadcasted it with a different wallet and it was finally confirmed.
So the lesson here is: if you want to accept 0-confirmation transactions, don't trust only one provider!
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:53:09
But if that attack enables the attacker to leak the memory of the server (in small, 64k batches, but still), wouldn't it be possible for him to steal private keys that are currently in use (hence they're in memory)? Or it only enables the attacker to read memory of the vurnable process (so if browser is the attack vector, reading bitcoind memory wouldn't be possible)?
@_date: 2014-03-19 10:41:47
Do you know if the core devs actually work towards that idea, or it was dismissed? Referencing UTXO's by NTXID would solve the problem completely.
@_date: 2014-03-04 14:40:36
Storing Bitcoins yourself, either on your computer, mobile, or even on a paper wallet, is not a perfect solution. You can have multiple paper backups of your private key, and only one of them needs to be compromised for you to lose funds (given that you didn't use multisig). Or if your computer was compromised at the time of generating your paper wallets. Or the printer. Or if you somehow downloaded a malicious copy of wallet generating software. And so on, and so on... Plus, with paper wallets, you lose all the convienience, so you cannot show your friends "how easy Bitcoin is", because it's not in that case. 
Traditional online wallets are a big no-no. There were numerous hacks in nearly every major Bitcoin online wallet - most recently - Flexcoin. Earlier: inputs.io. Earlier: mybitcoin.com. This is because they just store your unencrypted private key on their server, which is like an invitation for hackers to put their hands on them.
In my opinion currently the safest and most convienient solution to store Bitcoin now is to use hybrid, online, P2SH (multisignature) wallets. [Here's a nice explanation of how this can work]( There are alreaady few wallets that support this:
*  (full disclosure, I work there)
* 
*

At Bitalo, we also plan to add a mobile companion app for your specific use case - so you could actually use your Bitcoins easily, not only store them.

People going to Blockchain.info assume that it is de facto THE blockchain. That what they see there is actually on the Bitcoin network. That was not the case here. The transaction wasn't just unconfirmed. It was *unrelayed*, a totally different thing. It didn't existed anywhere else besides Blockchain.info.

I'm using it daily because I work for [Bitalo]( - the first multisignature wallet &amp; exchange. 
I really encourage you to give multisig a try (whether on Bitalo or on other wallets like BitGo or GreenAdress) because their convenience and safety are much higher than other currently available options:
* safer than storing coins on your computer, where a malicious program could [steal it](
* safer than in normal wallets/exchanges, which are also prone to hackers, or even can dissapear entirely
* easier to use than paper wallets, which are cumbersome if you actually want to **use** your Bitcoins.
* safer *and* easier than brain wallets, which are [generally a bad idea](
@_date: 2014-03-10 09:04:02
Glad I could help :)
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:40:43
Nice to see a fellow multisig wallet company :). We started last year already, but only starting to market the site some more now.
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:09:33
So how did the hacker did bypass the 2-factor then?
One possibility is that your computer was compromised when you were setting up 2-factor on Bitstamp. So the thief learned your 2FA secret key. That, together with your Bitstamp account and email account passwords stolen by a keylogger could lead to a successful theft.

At [Bitalo]( we use multisignature wallets which, among other things, makes using fractional reserve impossible, because each user owns his Bitcoin wallets and addresses, and we can only transfer funds out of them with him signing the transfer himself. Everything is completely transparent and visible on the Blockchain, so while gmaxwell's idea is very novel, there's no need for us to implement it because our users could verify what is happening with their wallets from day one. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:50:38
You are right, I probably shouldn't. Edited it out.

Thanks everyone for investigating that further. I hope the issue gets resolved for everyone that has their transactions stuck.

One girl I know managed to use Bitalo.com multisignature wallets without a problem even though she only learned about Bitcoinjust recently. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 06:44:26
Bitcoin Foundation operates mainly in the US. Bitalo operates in Germany, and is subject to its laws. Nothing we can do to circumvent that.
@_date: 2014-03-06 02:36:26
We already did start in January, already have about 150 wallets created and 600+ users overall. 
Because we use multisignature wallets we are transparent from the very beginning - everyone can lookup their wallets on the Blockchain and see that their funds are actually there.
Also, we don't work with banks directly because the exchange itself is peer to peer - we don't handle fiat.

API is on the roadmap. It's just so early that we didn't felt the need to do so yet.
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:12:00
AFAIK BitGo does 2-of-3. We do 2-of-2 because we also let you exchange your Bitcoins, and for that we need to act as an escrow, but we'll soon adding a presigned backup transaction option, so in an event that we go out of business, you could use that transaction to retrieve your coins at some point in the future.
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:59:21
Everything is still on the blockchain, so it is transparent :). When I'm saying "frozen" what I mean is, that we in our internal database flag this specific output so if the seller wanted to withdraw it, we won't allow him to (we won't sign the transaction), because it's a part of an ongoing transaction. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:52:27
Thanks! Believe it or not, but I'm not here for the money though, I'm only a developer on the team. I will probably not make money on Bitalo for long time. I made a mistake once and people got hurt, so I strive to create a Bitcoin service that will make it impossible for anyone to steal your Bitcoins - be it hackers or the site administrators themselves.
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:36:13
We don't hold the fiat. Users exchange fiat between themselves. After buyer pays in the fiat to sellers bank account, he releases the coins by signing a transaction to send coins to the buyer. That's it.
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:50:43
It would be more or less correct :). With one exception - Blockchain.info is a great service, but it has one downside - if your get a virus on your machine, you're screwed. Someone can read the private key when you log into your Blockchain wallet. On the other hand on Bitalo because we use multisig wallets AND two factor auth, so even if your computer at some point gets compromised, hacker would only get one part of the key, while we keep the other one safe. A hacker would need to compromise BOTH your computer and your smartphone to steal from you.

Yes, we cannot touch your Bitcoins because we only have one key. In the event we were to dissapear, we can release our private key DB and everyone could then claim their coins themselves.

As far as I know only relay fee was reduced. Default fee for miners was unchanged, it's still 0.0001

Scam operation? Do you have any basis for that accusation?
I've said that Google 2FA is insecure in that regard (system is compromised during account setup), because attacker could then steal 2FA key that is used to generate tokens.
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:38:33
Because sellers have to verify their bank accounts, they are less likely to scam the buyers. But in the case a scam seller would appear, we use a "[lock time]( transaction during the exchange, that after certain time (14 days at this moment) with no agreement from both parties lets us claim the Bitcoins and solve the dispute ourselves. If parties do agree before this period passes, Bitcoins get released to the buyer and we cannot do anything else with them.
@_date: 2014-02-15 07:16:08
Bitomat.pl had quite big userbase (Bitcoin is somewhat popular in Poland). So they basically sold all their userbase to Mt.Gox in exchange for paying for lost coins.

[Transaction fees]( page on Bitcoin wiki explains well how original Bitcoin clients treats transactions with and without fees, what are the rules for block inclusion, etc. That said, probably no one uses reference client to mine now, so it all falls down to what rules do pool owners enforce. One pool may not accept transactions that have low priority (coins are "fresh", transaction is bigger than usual), others may do. Eventually every transaction will be accepted to a block, but if you want your transaction to be processed fast you should pay a fee.
@_date: 2013-10-01 12:07:47
Upcoming Bitcoin online wallet/exchange,  will support multisignature wallets to prevent theft. We're starting very soon, stay tuned!

There are no fees at the moment (except for network transaction fees), but eventually there will be. They will be smaller than our competitors, though. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:05:05
How about let's all agree that sites that take your BTC should **require** users to set up 2-factor? I know it sounds silly now because almost nobody does it, but stop for a moment and think - would your bank let you open an account with online access *without* 2-factor? No, they won't, because *that* sounds silly. Bank account without 2-factor, really? And then, you have Bitcoin "banks" that will happily let you to use lame passwords and don't use 2-factor.
That's exactly why on [Bitalo]( we require our users to use 2-factor, period. Even if that means less users registering and using the service, thus less revenue. We just don't want our users to have their funds stolen, period.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:43:46
Why won't you release account information and funds you have for the Bitcoinica LP case? The liquidators said that you won't cooperate with them. From my (and many others) point of view you just stole the funds and are ruining the chances of returning the funds to people. Please fell free to prove us wrong, or at least say something about the case.
@_date: 2013-10-31 07:09:27
Yes, you can call it this way. One thing that we differ currently is that we don't support in-person exchange, but we may add that in the future. Another difference is that we'd like to deliver more than just a secure online wallet and exchange. We already have a mining pool nearing completion.

The problem with Bitcoin security is that it's a big hassle. Almost nobody stores their savings in a secure vault under his home, even for relatively large sums. Most people choose banks because they're convenient, while providing a sense of (arguably false) security.
We need to figure a way for people to have a secure Bitcoin storage by default. Without installing fresh copy of Linux that never saw Internet together with a brand-new USB stick containing bitaddress.org source code to generate paper wallets. Outside of small circle of geeks nobody uses such system. It's hard to even understand by non-tech savvy people, not mentioning actually using it in real life.
That's exactly the problem we're trying to solve at [Bitalo]( using multi-signature Bitcoin wallets (which means that there are two private keys, one known only to service provider, i.e. us, and the second one is known only to the user; both are needed for signature to spend the funds) coupled with a secure two-factor solution (which is mandatory, but also hassle free, utilizing [MePIN]( I hope that more services adopt this scheme, so we all can be a little more secure.
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:48:50
This is exactly why we decided to found [Bitalo]( in Germany. It's a really good place to have a Bitcoin business, because the government's stance on Bitcoins is clear. You cannot say the same about UK unfortunately.

@_date: 2013-12-08 09:37:48
Exactly. If one believes in Bitcoin and wants to help it somehow, the best way to do it is not to just "buy and hold". The best way is to help building the infrastructure by either investing (in companies, miners, etc.), starting a new company around it or spreading the word and spending. If everyone just held, Bitcoin would collapse pretty quickly.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:02:34
I see you entirely missed my point. Oh well.
@_date: 2013-08-11 18:37:32
It is easy to exploit. It's only a matter of time when somebody will write an automated script that scoops all vurnable coins, if it didn't already happen.
@_date: 2013-11-02 19:48:04
Most exchanges work that way, i.e. you have a deposit address, but you send from bunch of other addresses. So the address doesn't really belong to you, it's only a deposit address they watch to credit your account. It also couldn't be done differently, because of usage of hot/cold wallets, which means that most of the funds on "your" deposit address are not present there. Coins are always sent from randomly selected wallets from exchange's poll of wallets that actually have funds, and all remaining ones are stored offline for added security.
On the other hand, at [Bitalo]( we use a different system, when you own a private key which we don't know, thus both receiving *and* sending addresses are under your control. So when someone wants to refund you, they can use sending address without problems.
@_date: 2013-10-02 12:55:16
At Bitalo (an upcoming Bitcoin service that will launch this week) we use SRP - a method of authentication developed at Stanford University. It still uses passwords, but they are never transmitted to the server. Instead, a verifier (which is basically a very large number) is only stored on the server, and authentication is done via computing a shared secret. This, together with proper 2-factor, gives a pretty damn good security for pretty much every purpose. 
The downside of proposed method is that it drastically changes user's interaction with website. Instead of simply inputting his password, he has now to launch dedicated software (or install a browser plugin) on his computer. Most people will not want to do this. 
It also implies that user has to unlock the private key in order to sign the message - at which point malicious software could steal it as easy as key logger can steal plain password.

You never know when Google starts to ban Bitcoin apps because it competes with their Google Wallet payment business.
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:08:50
By safer we mean that we use multi signature addresses to store users' Bitcoins. In this scheme, two private keys are used for one address, one of which is known to Bitalo, and the other is known only to the user (technically speaking, it's encrypted with user's password, which never reaches our servers). This way no coins are stored on the server directly, there is no wallet.dat to steal, and even we can't access the funds without user signing the transaction. 
Of course it boils down to whether you trust our scripts to don't do anything malicious like logging your password. The javascript source is open and unobfuscated, so you can inspect it at any moment. No code is injected from the outside of our server. Other than that we are a registered company in Germany. with (pending atm) AG status (Incorporated-like stock trading company with more than 50,000 EUR funding capital), so we're not going anywhere soon.
If anyone is interested in getting an invite, drop me a message at maciej at bitalo.com. If you have any technical questions whether how multi signature stuff works, feel free to ask :).

Don't get me wrong, but when I've read "Plan to Secure your Bitcoin" and then heard "we're doing something unique" I was expecting more. Hot/Cold storage is of course an absolute minimum to secure Bitcoins, but almost every bigger Bitcoin service does it already. There are more secure schemes and I was hoping that they will want to implement them as well.

@_date: 2013-11-05 10:01:04
That's the case for any online wallet, though that problem can be mitigated. Since you own your private key you can make a backup yourself. And the service owner could and should have a kill switch which would release all its private keys in a catastrophic event like this, so users can send their funds to somewhere else.
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:09:34
That argument is flawed. First of all 2-factor is not only about smartphones. It can include Yubikeys or other USB keys, or just SMS passwords as well.
Also, if you have more than 1 BTC to host anywhere, you can probably afford a smarphone, even if it was a cheap android phone that would be only used for 2-factor.

Blockchain.info is technically not an online wallet. It's more of a web Bitcoin client, which operates on your private key directly. This is different than any online *hosted* wallet, which hosts your private keys unencrypted.
