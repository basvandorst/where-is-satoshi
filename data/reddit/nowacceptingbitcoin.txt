All I was saying is that it won't fall below $4k today. It's a great place to buy and then sell it after a 15% pop off  the bottom.  I bought at $4,115 and will sell as soon as it hits $4,650.

Good thing $4k is an impenetrable wall! Watch, it won't dip below it.  not today at least.

Well. At least gpu prices should start coming down. Which would be totally exciting if I hadn't already lost all my money in Bitcoin.

Dog shit, now 55% off! I don't actually think Bitcoin is going to zero, but I don't pretend to know what the bottom is either.

Ha! No, no, no. It's behaving like a commodity, which makes sense since that's kind of what it is. It will continue a gradual decline before bottoming out  and staying flat for six or seven years. Which would be awesome, because then people would use it as currency as was intended in the first place.

Short term though, he's losing his dick.  And that shit is forever.

I feel like someone touched my no no spot.

It's not that simple.  People were screaming doom and gloom when Bitcoin fell from $19,000 to $16,000.  According to your logic, buying at $16,000 would have been a smart move.

And Chinese New Year will be over soon.

Even if it turns out there's no place in the future for Bitcoin, I think people will still want to own it just as a bit of novelty.  Therefore, I doubt it would ever drop below a buck. "Hey, remember when everyone was crazy about Bitcoin?" "Lol, oh yeah! I bought a few for shits and giggles when it went down to two dollars. I can't believe they used to be worth almost $20,000 each!"
