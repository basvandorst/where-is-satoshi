I'm not sure why people keep repeating that the hackers are asking for 1 million bitcoins....they are holding an all pay auction where each bidder must pay whether they win the auction or not...IF they raise 1 million bitcoins they claim they will release the files for everyone, not just the auction winner.  So presumably, the high bid can still win the files without bidding 1 million btc.  
Of course, it's probably a scam and they won't release them anyway, but who knows

If you are getting 2fa authentications when you haven't been trying to log in to whatever account is sending the 2fa, it's a pretty good sign someone else IS trying to access your account with your username/password.  OP implied he had an account at Bitfinex, so it's not a huge leap to think that maybe his data at Bitfinex was hacked, which could be connected to whoever is trying to log in to his mutual fund account.

IANAL, but as far as I know from what I've gleaned here, in the USA you need a license for any amount of money transmission, under/over 1k, any amount.   And btc transactions fall under that.  Ive looked into it and the license costs are prohibitive to say the least.  There are other threads with better info if you look.  Of course you can always just do what you do and hope your small volume flies under the radar, but you definitely need a license to be strictly "legal"

Sure, you could do that, or buy on local bitcoins at whatever their premium is....but if you ever want to sell, how do you propose getting around the taxes then?  And if you are a hodl forever type of person, it doesn't really matter where you buy, eventually you will just spend your bitcoin as currency, and by then it will have much more advanced privacy upgrades to the point where the gov. couldn't collect taxes from it if they wanted to.  But yes, you have much more privacy if you are willing to pay the large premiums at ATMs or Localbitcoins.

I recently learned that the coins they hold online (which are about 2% of the coins they hold) are insured as well (in the case of a breach on their security or employee theft), but I assume they would have to pay out in fiat.  But if your individual account is compromised, you are fucked.  And even if they will pay out fiat for a breach of those 2% of coins, you might still be fucked, if bitcoin price doubles before you get your fiat payout.

This post just moves the goalposts even further.  Your original comment was about how ironic it is that Andreas doesn't accept Bitcoin for donations because the fees are too high.  (He does accept bitcoin, and the fees are not too high for him to do so, as I have pointed out.)  After having it pointed out to you, your second comment admits that he said nothing about fees but then expresses skepticism that this isn't the real reason, and then just launches into more bullshit about fees, even though this conversation has nothing to do with them.  You end it by asking what universe I live in to consider a 24 hour time frame acceptable for a bitcoin transaction.  When it is pointed out to you that 24 hours is a perfectly acceptable time frame depending on what use case we are discussing (you know, like THIS use case), you move the goalposts even further by citing a hypothetical example of a laptop business.  By now we've gotten miles away from the topic being discussed in your original comment because you refuse to stop moving the goalposts (which I've found is a common tactic employed by shills.  If you are not one, I apologize but you certainly fit the profile.)  We were never talking about a laptop business, we were talking about donations to Andreas in btc.  You've gone from falsely claiming that Andreas doesn't accept Bitcoin because the fees are too high, to saying "yeah but we should use BCH because it would be better for some hypothetical laptop business."  Do you see the problem I'm having here?  You say you're not a shill, but you basically only post in r/btc about BCH's perceived superiority over Bitcoin, you make false claims that support this narrative, and during discussion you constantly move the goalposts, always bringing everything back to BCH and high fees, even when it has nothing to do with the topic at hand.  Sounds pretty shilly to me.
A footnote on your 2nd point above:  Yes, many wallets are extremely shitty and set fees well above what is necessary to get transactions confirmed quickly.  This is a wallet problem, not a bitcoin problem.  And yes, if Andreas rooted for BCH he would probably get a lot of BCH donations...wtf is your point?  How is this ironic?  Are you trying to imply AGAIN that he doesn't receive bitcoin donations because the fees are too high?  He's received tens of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin from many different people in the last 24 hours.  How will you move the goalposts next?

Alright, if that is the case I apologize for calling you a shill.  It's hard, because there are obviously a lot of them floating around, but it does damage when regular folks who differ in opinion or are just learning are accused of shilling, so I'll stop with that.  
With regard to confirmation times...I hear what you're saying, and I'm not trying to say that I'm perfectly happy with how the fees are going in the short term, but I feel like the scenarios you raise are the same with any other coin.  When people used bitcoin for such things in the past, such as a bartab or whatever, they didn't wait around at the bar for the transaction to receive 6 or 8 confirmations.  The bar gets the transaction at 0 conf and it's good enough.  Even 3-4 years ago, blocks still propagated at the same rate, so if you're waiting for more confirmations to be sure, you'd be waiting a while.  It's a level of risk that businesses accepting bitcoin have to weigh and accept, that the majority of their customers aren't going to be scamming them with double spends to get out of paying their bartabs.  Even now, if you paid a fee high enough to be included in the next block, if the merchant you are paying doesn't want to accept 0conf transactions, you're going to be waiting around a while.  As far as I know, most merchants accepting bitcoin don't require high numbers of confirmations before they consider the transaction valid.  
I agree Bitcoin needs to scale, it is currently not ready for everyone on Earth to be using it transactionally, but I disagree that BCH has solved these scaling problems.  Right now it is much faster and cheaper because its transaction volume is basically nothing compared to Bitcoin...it isn't even filling 20% of 1MB blocks.  Luckily scaling solutions are on the horizon.

I suggest not buying on Coinbase because they charge very high fees compared to other exchanges, even their own (GDAX).  It's "convenient" I guess, but they really add up.  Get verified to use GDAX or Gemini and buy there.  I will say, for some reason I have had an insane amount of trouble getting verified on GDAX, even though I've been a Coinbase customer for 4 years.  None of the methods available will recognize my ID for whatever reason, and Coinbase support is notoriously almost non existent.  I got fully verified on Gemini the same day I signed up.

Except his post has nothing to do with fees.  He is saying that bitcoin doesn't have a mechanism to support "pull" payments, so merchants can't automatically pull funds from your wallet for recurring automatic payments like they can with credit cards.  With bitcoin, you must authorize each transaction yourself.  Hint: BCH works the same way.  This is why he said that smart contracts might allow this functionality on bitcoin in the future.
However, this isn't stopping bcash shills (including yourself) from twisting this into an issue about fees.  Read what the man wrote.
Edit:  I wanted to add that as of right now, even in a very high volume period with 86k unconfirmed transactions, paying a 10 sat/byte fee (around 23 cents) will get your transaction confirmed within 24 hours.  This is about 7 times less than your made up fee levels necessary to send bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:41:35
Pointing out problems with the bitcoin network is not the same as constantly repeating the same exact same talking points all over the internet in an attempt to create a narrative.  Also, on reddit, there's this thing called post history.  The Bcash troll army constantly points out the title of the white paper while ignoring the rest of it.  If you had actually read the white paper, you wouldn't be hyping bitcoin as a faster paypal, you would understand that its entire purpose is to be a network to transfer value WITHOUT TRUST.  It's not my fault you all sound the same, try mixing your comments up a bit or trying to blend in better.

1) He accepts crypto AND fiat for donations...the image posted on r/btc conveniently leaves that part out, so people can ridicule him.  He suggests fiat for RECURRING DONATIONS because crypto is not best suited for these types of payments.  Recurring donations are good for the person receiving the donations, because people are more likely to let it ride for a period of time than they are to manually authorize a new donation every month, resulting in more money donated.  People set up recurring donations all the fucking time, I'm not going to look that up for you.  If they didn't, why would it be an option?
"While a monthly recurring donation is the best way to support me, I also accept donations in bitcoin or other crypto-currencies. Please send your donations to: 1andreas3batLhQa2FawWjeyjCqyBzypd"
2) 10 sat/byte fee absolutely gets you confirmed within 24 hours.  No bullshit, refer to  and  (scroll down to mempool size, add up transaction sizes from top to bottom until you get a sum of 144 blocks or less, look at corresponding fee).  When you make transactions, do you use your wallet's default fee options, or do you use a wallet that allows you to set the fee yourself?  Right now you could actually pay closer to 5 sat/byte and probably get confirmed in 24 hours.
What you consider to be an acceptable timeframe varies from case to case depending on what your transaction is for.  Can you explain to me why a 24 hour time frame is unacceptable in this use case, sending a very small donation to Andreas?  Does he really need your $1.50 donation RIGHT NOW, or is it acceptable to send an appropriate fee so that he receives it in 1 day?  This would still probably result in him being able to access his funds faster than with a fiat payment processor.
Bcash shills love moving the goalposts.  First, you completely misrepresent what is actually on his donation page, to make it look like the community's primary evangelist doesn't even use bitcoin because the fees are too high (which in turn feeds into Roger's douchey comment about him yesterday designed to smear him as somebody who didn't even invest in the technology he supposedly loves so much.)
Then, when called out on your bullshit and having it pointed out that his post has nothing to do with fees, you move the goalposts with a conspiracy theory about the REAL reason he doesn't accept bitcoin for donations (even though he does), and double down on that made up reason (fees) with some anecdotal evidence that you personally recently paid too much to use the network.  It's not my fault you can't figure out how to use bitcoin properly.

No, the entire purpose of this technology was not to transfer value cheaper and faster than banks.  The purpose is to "allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution"....."Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.".....CONCLUSION "We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust. "
The white paper focused almost exclusively on the idea of a system to send money without relying on trust, not on "fast, cheap transactions."  Yes, thus far, fast and cheap transactions have been an additional selling point, and they will be again in the future when true, safe scaling is achieved, but this is nowhere close to the entire point of the technology.  Maintaining robust decentralization is paramount in a system designed to send value without relying on trust.  If you want nothing more than fast, cheap transactions, use credit cards or paypal.

I actually haven't used GDAX, as I still can't seem to get my identity verified by them.  I've been more of a hodler than a trader, so I've only used the regular Coinbase site for most of my purchases...I've tried on and off to get verified for GDAX, but every time I try it says my ID can't be recognized...this year I've finally sold some of my coins, and I finally got sick of the fees (after one day adding them all up to see what they've cost me...I think I used Coinbase for so long out of pure laziness) so I use Gemini now.  I can tell you that Gemini is very slick and professional.  I believe GDAX does have higher volume, but that shouldn't matter much if you are just buying and not trading much

I felt the same way in late 2013, early 2014.  I had followed it since Silk Road, watched it go up to 260, called it a bubble without having any understanding of the tech, felt self satisfied when it crashed, then when Silk Road got busted I assumed bitcoin was dead.  Then it went to 1150.  I can't remember exactly when my understanding changed, but I became a hodler around $800, began buying as much as I could, from 800 down to 200, and back up to around 600.  Yes, if I had waited and bought less from 800 to 600, I would have more btc now...but you can't time the market.  Do your research, figure out if you think bitcoin will be useful and valuable in the future, and if you decide so, start buying now.  Buy as much as you can afford to comfortably lose, and continue doing so regardless of price.  Hodl for 5 years...........profit?

To be useful as a widely used currency, it must increase in value from now A LOT, because A) it's scarce, and if everyone actually ends up using it, the market cap has to be high enough to actually serve useful as a global currency, and B), higher market cap and more coins in people's hands = less volatility, which is necessary for a currency.  You can't use a currency that isn't worth anything. It is still young, for now it's fine that it's seen as a speculative investment, it won't be a widely useful currency for the masses for some time yet.

I'm pretty sure you can tip whoever you are replying to, whether it is the OP or somebody who made a reply.  That is how the doge bot works anyway.  I believe we will receive messages from the bot confirming the tip and giving us the option to accept them.

Two things caught my eye.  
One, in his complaint post on r/buttcoin he mentions that he is never antagonistic and only posts here "occasionally, mostly to recommend kids not spend all of their money on Bitcoin or, perhaps, not removing all their friends that don't support Bitcoin."  A quick look back on the first few pages of his posting history shows 40+ comments on r/bitcoin and r/buttcoin in the past couple of weeks.  Pretty troll-y.
Two, he posted this complaint thread 4 days ago.  Really, crazy bitcoiners have been calling your business for 4 days?  So much so that you felt compelled to make another thread about it?  Nobody cares about you that much.

Sounds like you've never been to r/btc.  It seems that many people are hostile to SegWit, see 
[**"a lot of the stuff that's gone into Core during the 0.12 development cycle is garbage and needs to be removed. For example the RBF changes, the SegWit stuff that'll get dropped in there at some point..."**](
or this [ridiculous conspiracy]( post that received gold in an equally asinine and childish thread.
It is absolutely not a false narrative that a significantly loud group of people are pro hard fork at any cost or risk, and as a result of this ideology, they are anti-segwit.

To be fair, multiple (all?) Core Devs have acknowledged that we will have to hard fork to a larger block size at some point, but that we should be very careful in how we do it in order to keep this experiment of ours decentralized and robust.  However, the debate has been falsely framed in a way that paints Core as refusing any block size increase under any circumstance...it seems what you are really asking for is a confirmation that the "HF to larger blocks will occur.....within a reasonable timeframe."  To me it seems like the whole debate at this point boils down to our definitions of "reasonable timeframe".  One side of this debate has been screaming that the sky is falling and doom is nigh, so for them a reasonable timeframe = NOW.  In my opinion, this is a huge exaggeration of the situation, and I understand why Core would generally ignore this kind of FUD.  They know we'll have to hard fork, but they want to approach this thing from a scientific angle and make sure that it works the way it's supposed to.  That being said, I agree that Core should think about throwing a bone and giving everyone some sort of idea for when the HF could reasonably occur, which could result in possibly reducing a lot of the toxicity that has been pervading this community for so long.

I was actually just recently looking into selling on localbitcoins, but came to the conclusion that buying on an exchange and then reselling on either localbitcoins or Mycelium at a profit technically makes you a money transmitter due to Fincen's 2013 ruling, no matter what your volume is.  As a result, sellers are probably operating illegally unless they pony up $40k or so for money transmitter licenses.  
As I understand it, liquidating what you already have is probably ok, but repeatedly buying bitcoin at a certain price and then reselling at a markup on localbitcoins makes you a money transmitter in the eyes of the state.  I'm sure people still do it, because the market is still small enough to fly under the radar, but I would be very careful with any plans for such business.

Like, "choosing to believe" and "temporarily getting discouraged" and top comment commending OP and admitting he was 
weak for "beginning to doubt".  I was raised in a fairly fundamentalist Christian house and this shit gave me flashbacks.  I'm as big a fan of bitcoin as anyone, and a hodler, and I get the sentiment, but I also understand why this shit might sound weird to an outsider.  Oh well.

I've been on the fence during the blocksize debate, cautiously leaning on the side of bigger blocks (XT seemed a little too extreme, but it got the ball rolling, I think 2-4-8 is reasonable but I understand the arguments from the small blockers about decentralization risks) but Mike Hearn's exit/attack on Bitcoin, and his employment/coordination with R3 have given me pause and actually made me sympathize with small blockers more than ever before...we've always been worried about a government shutting us down outright, but I think this is actually how we'll be attacked by powerful adversaries...with sneaky dividing techniques, co-opt attempts, and mass media FUD.  It highlights more than ever that bitcoin needs to stay as decentralized and censorship resistant as possible above all...this is what gives it value.  Especially when we have segregated witness, sidechains, and LN in the pipeline for scaling and other innovations.

Assuming you are in the US
Step 1: register with a reputed exchange like Coinbase, Gemini, etc.
Step 2: Buy bitcoin
Step 3: Buy a hardware wallet, like Trezor, Keepkey, Ledger...I've only used Trezor, so it's the only one I would recommend.  These should be easy to figure out if you are reasonably competent.  If you don't want to buy a hardware wallet, use your problem solving skills to figure out a paper wallet or just use a phone wallet.
Step 4: Transfer bitcoin from the exchange of your choice to the wallet of your choice
Step 5: HODL
I really don't understand the difficulty

I agree with the first part of your post.  If bad actors can successfully take down Bitcoin through deception or any other tactics, it was doomed from the start.  I hope this isn't the case (In my opinion this isn't the case, but what do I know).  I don't agree that it's impossible to know a lie when you see one, or that intent is as private as a private key.  A lie can be objectively proven, and a person's actions often make their intent crystal clear.  If your opponent is objectively lying you are absolutely not doing your argument a disservice by calling him a liar.  How can you even have an honest argument if one side is objectively lying or just making shit up?

I know that it's a common narrative that the core devs are bought and paid for by blockstream, and intentionally keeping the blocksize low as an economic throttle for financial gain.  I almost bought into it at first because it jerks our emotions...but I think it's a leap to assume all "small blockers" have ulterior motives and want to hurt bitcoin.  It's not a conspiracy theory I believe in.  Your point with the Satoshi quote about the blocksize limit being a temporary spam filter is a good point, but things have changed since then, there's a lot of money and business riding on this, and I think it's worth stepping back and thinking about the risks of a hard fork especially with all the technology in the pipeline for bitcoin.  I'm not fully advocating for either side (small vs big blocks) I just think the small blockers only want to protect what we have, and keep bitcoin as decentralized as possible.  My two cents

I agree with you that growth is important, and that soon we'll need 2MB blocks, or even higher.  But I disagree that we need an emergency hard fork right away to do it, and I think the creation of panic around this issue is disingenuous.  Bitcoin *is* growing, but it will not break if transaction fees go a few pennies higher for a few months while the developers implement careful, intelligent solutions.   What will break bitcoin is a situation where it becomes centralized and vulnerable to sabotage or takeover.  And if it gets to a point where it truly isn't working, we can hard fork as an emergency...I just don't think that's going to happen though, and the constant FUD suggesting it is or will seems incredibly suspicious to me.  I just think we should err on the side of caution.

I think it is more the idea that certain well placed actors are manipulating the ongoing debate, stoking the fires for their own gain,  etc., rather than a claim that the whole previous 2 years + of scaling debate is all just about a ploy to pump altcoins...I mean you can obviously see that any perceived crisis in bitcoin in the recent past has been capitalized on by altcoin pumpers (the previous ETH pump/dump/fork for example)
Edit:  So, I think it's an oversimplification to say that ALL the drama is a ploy to pump altcoins, but certainly a lot of it is.  I mean, look at the altcoins right now lol.

I actually had a very similar question recently in another thread and was informed that Coinbase is insured in case of their cold storage reserves being hacked...however most people who lose money on Coinbase are likely to be hacked on their personal devices through phishing, keylogging, etc...if a hacker gains access to your account and drains it, you have no recourse.  This is why people suggest cold storage.

Coinbase is basically a brokerage, you are paying fees to them for the convenience of using your bank account/debit card to easily purchase bitcoin.  It is usually pretty close to market price, but can be a little more expensive with the fees.  If you don't want to pay the fees and are looking to make more trades, you'll have to register with an actual exchange, and possibly get verified, etc. etc.  Coinbase isn't really a good choice for active trading.

I bought a good chunk of my current holdings with a credit card (intro 0% APR for 18 months) when I didn't really have further capital to invest.  I didn't go too overboard, but I had to work for a while to pay off the debt before the interest payments kicked in.  It worked pretty well for me, obviously, but this was also when bitcoin was dropping back into the 400-300-200 dollar ranges before the last bear market ended.   It was too enticing to resist scooping up the cheap coins.  I fully realized how ridiculous it was by conventional wisdom, but I did it anyway and now I'm glad I did.

How the fuck is that at all obvious from your comment?  It doesn't even make sense.  You're mocking people for "believing increases"?  What? lol is English your first language, if not I apologize but you seem like you can barely form coherent sentences and you lack reading comprehension.  OP was making a joke about noobs freaking out over a 20% drop in price, saying "welcome to crypto" sarcastically because that kind of drop is run of the mill in this market, I'm not sure if you're aware, but the price is extremely volatile and routinely crashes and rises crazier percentages than that.  Nobody is "dismissing decreases", actually its the opposite, OP is acknowledging that there are very frequent severe decreases, and making fun of noobs for freaking out about it. Also, luckily for many of us here "belief" in price increases isn't necessary, it's kind of just a fact at the moment lol. Belief has nothing to do with it, maybe your vocabulary is small and you were thinking of another word.  Lots of people are pretty understandably excited at the moment because the price of the thing they own has risen 1000% on the year (like for really real, not just a belief), people have been making a lot of money, and you're over here struggling to read and write, going "hurr durr bitcoiners stupid, u believe in price increase?"

@_date: 2017-11-26 20:47:29
Ah, I stand corrected.  Although it should be noted that only the coins held by Coinbase "online" are insured.  Am I correct to assume that if a breach occurred and coins were stolen, customers would be paid out in fiat?  This could still be problematic, say if you held 10 coins that were stolen in a breach of Coinbase's online wallets, and it took some time to receive a fiat insurance payment, and the coins value rose significantly in the meantime.  
Also, there is the fact that coins are not insured if a customer's account is compromised...this risk can be mitigated by using a strong password and 2fa, but it's certainly possible.  It's still safer to hold your coins in a hardware wallet, and more in line with the entire purpose of bitcoin to begin with.

Yes, I believe if Coinbase suspends your account, they allow you to withdraw your bitcoin...I wasn't really talking about that scenario.  OP is asking if it's safe to store that much money on an exchange, and based on the ecosystem in the past, with hacked exchanges, exchanges running off with customer funds, or running fractional reserves or other frauds, the general answer is NO, it's not safe.  It's happened many many times.  However, in the case of Gemini (and Coinbase), you can rest fairly easy that your USD isn't going anywhere, they are regulated and insured.  My example was referring to the recent bitcoin cash hard fork, folks who held their own private keys at the time of the fork suddenly had an equal amount of BCH and BTC....they were able to separate them and sell, hold, spend, do whatever they want...folks who let Coinbase hold their bitcoin for them are still waiting for Coinbase to give them their bitcoin cash.  Also, even though USD is insured on these exchanges, your bitcoin is not.  In the event that the exchange is hacked, or an attacker gains access to your account and steals you bitcoin, you are out of luck.  These are only two examples.  If you aren't sure what I'm talking about, look up "hard forks"

No problem. I also wanted to add, if you got into this for ideological reasons (I want my value to increase, but I also am in this for more than just profit), bubbles and mania don't change this.  They are a part of the necessary steps in bootstrapping this thing to a level where it can make some real changes.  If you are thinking of selling most of your coins with the idea that you can probably buy them all back at a lower price, that is pure profit motive, and nothing to do with ideology.  And there's nothing wrong with that, but from my perspective, with a profit motive in mind, it is incredibly risky to ever sell that percentage of your holdings unless you're completely ok with a scenario where the price does another 5x and you may never get them back.  If you have seen your crypto wealth grow to levels you are uncomfortable with relative to your other wealth, by all means diversify and spread out the risk, but I still think you're crazy for thinking of selling 80% haha.  Regardless I wish you good luck.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:03:26
Dude you're crazy.

I completely understand your concern, and we are talking about real money, so each person involved has to make their own decisions about what is best for them in their own particular situation according to their risk tolerance.  And yes, obviously everyone is hyped AF right now, and there is plenty of blind optimism going around, but I guess my point is that this has happened before, and will very likely happen again.  The fundamentals are as strong as they've ever been...and most long term hodlers recognize the pattern.  I'm not saying it's a bad idea to take some profit just in case, but if you've been in this for a while you know how difficult it is to time the market.  How many people in the past sold everything and cried later?  Do what you have to do, if you need the money you should sell, you are the only one who knows your situation, but damn....80%.  I don't think I could do it.

There was no harm done partly because there was widespread community outrage and backlash against the incompetent attack.  What creates more *instability* in the market, a buggy takeover attempt with no replay protection coded by one shitty developer and shilled by a bunch of CEOs in direct contention with the community and every competent developer currently working on the network, OR the people on this subreddit that rightfully got worked up over it?

In my opinion (and probably most others here, or they wouldn't be here) it is unlikely to go to zero at this point.  But anything is possible, it is still very much an experiment.  It is far more likely to go through a long period of painful correction, in the past 3 bubbles it has lost as much as 90%, 70%, 80% respectively before going back up.  Which is why, if you are just looking to make a quick buck, you should probably not throw any more money in....if you really understand the technology and its implications, and you are willing to wait and hodl, perhaps for years, until the value goes up, I say fuck it, up your stack to 1 btc, maybe you can buy a house with it one day.

Do you mean posts like this, or the attacks to which the post is referring?  If you mean the S2X attack, I kind of understand where you're coming from, although I think you're wrong.  If you mean posts like this, I would counter that deciding whether or not to invest in a potentially disruptive technology based solely on a random internet post is incredibly dumb and lazy.  Either way, whether or not you invest is obviously up to you, the only person who will be affected by your decision is yourself.

How do you figure it has a low price tag?  Just because the cost of a single whole token is only 23 cents?  It has a circulating supply of 3.6 billion tokens.  If that was a reason to invest, I would be buying dogecoin, or penny stocks.  Not to mention the price is up 30x in 1 year, I wouldn't call that a low price tag.

Cool idea.  I think it's likely that he is gone, and the coins are locked up forever, but I love the idea that he is just sitting on them, waiting for the right moment to use them for good.  It would make him even more of a benevolent genius hero than he already is.
Also, I like your valuation of the bitcoin price when Satoshi decides to spread the wealth.  In 20 years, the world population will be around 9 billion...1 million bitcoins divided by 9 billion comes out to 0.0001.  If that equals $500 USD, 1 bitcoin is $5 million :)

Spend £4k and increase your holdings to 1 bitcoin, keep £2k just in case you need it.  But only if you are willing to hodl for at least 5 years, and only if you wouldn't be too upset if you ended up losing that money.  Do you have any debt, is your school paid for? 
Edit:  Or you could dollar cost average, start making weekly buys of smaller amounts, you might end up with more or less, but you wouldn't be putting all money in at once.

TIL being excited about getting rich is autism
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:03:33
The highest fees will be included first, so you would want to add up the number of txs from top to bottom...so, according to the chart you posted here, you would add up 16+37+64, etc. until you get down to "+521" which equals 2,327 txs.  So if you absolutely need to get into the next block, you would want to include a fee of at least 280 sat/byte, which corresponds with that number.  If I understand correctly though, it's always possible that other higher fee transactions could come through in the meantime and bump you down in line, so if it's THAT important you might want to pay a little higher fee.  
Edit:  Now I'm second guessing my understanding, so if I'm wrong, someone please correct me.
For transactions where getting into the next block isn't that important, I've found  to be pretty useful and fairly accurate.  Like, if you're just sending money from one address to another you control, and you're willing to wait a day and want to pay less fees.
Hope this helps.

Very similar situation with coinbase, they are FDIC insured up to 250k for USD...pretty much like a bank, but if you are buying bitcoin there, you should immediately transfer it to a wallet you control.  Perfect example is with all these shitcoin forks going on now, people with bitcoin stored on Coinbase are still waiting for control of money that is rightfully theirs...and if your account gets hacked, or Coinbase gets hacked, the bitcoin is not insured and you are shit out of luck.

I am interested in an answer to this too, as I am still learning, but I don't think this is correct.  If I understand correctly, I think that some 10 sat/byte transactions are now clearing, but they are older transactions that are just now clearing as the mempool is going down...I don't think making a 10 sat/byte transaction right now would likely get you confirmed in the next block.  But, again, I am not an expert and could be wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:51:05
Your USD is safe with Gemini, but as soon as you buy coin, you should immediately transfer it off the exchange to a wallet you control.  If you don't control the private keys, it's not your money.  Gemini is probably one of the safest exchanges though.

I tried all the different ways, and they cannot verify me, and everyone knows support is useless.

I know they are like a brokerage and not an actual exchange, so they derive the price from gdax, maybe the ask/bid spread was super wide on gdax at the time?  Regardless, that is crazy. There's always been a small spread but as the price has risen its gone up a crazy amount. You would also end up paying an additional 1.5% on that purchase putting the fees at $145, and an additional 1.5% when you sell.  I get that its convenient for noobs who don't want to learn exchange mechanics, but fuck that.  I'm kind of pissed I was so lazy about switching for so long now that I calculate up all the fees they got from me over the years.

I am interested in opinions on this as well.  I've read from some people that it will suppress the price, similar to the gold market.  I've read from others that it will stabilize the price somewhat, and end the wild volatile digital gold rush days, although it may still go up over time.  And I've read from others that will have no long term effect either way...I have nothing to back this up, but my gut tells me that long term, it won't have much of an effect in terms of suppressing the price if bitcoin really is what we think it is...decentralized, censorship resistant, limited supply, sound money.

First of all, the $ value of the transaction is irrelevant, if I'm not mistaken.  Second, what is "full fee"?  What fee did you pay?  And if it took an hour to get a confirmation...so what?  It happens all the time.  Look at this OP from 2013 


From the top comment, Satoshi's response to the same question years before


If you are crying about bitcoin being "unusable" because you had to wait an hour for a confirmation, or pay 10 cents more on a transaction fee, you never had a firm understanding of what makes bitcoin valuable in the first place.

The sudden drops can be kind of scary sometimes, but the real pain is in the long, drawn out bear markets...the last one was a slow 1 year bleed down over 80%, and then almost another year sideways before it started going back up.  It takes a lot of belief and confidence in the technology to scoop up those cheap coins when others are losing confidence and there is no end in sight.
There has always been FUD, hostility, attacks, and drama and there probably will be for quite some time.  It sounds like you have a good attitude towards the experiment, it helps to not have invested more than you can afford to lose...no matter what happens, we will all be a part of history :)

I don't really think any developers are doing anything with the specific goal of creating/fostering a premature fee market, it's more like they are acknowledging that a fee market must emerge eventually, and they are rejecting the doom and gloom fear mongering scenarios posited by those who demand big blocks now at any cost.  Bitcoin will not break if the fees go up a little bit while we figure out how to properly scale it. 
The eventual fee market is necessary to incentivize miners to secure the network when the bitcoin block reward becomes less and less in the future...the reason nobody advocates for smaller blocks now to accelerate the growth of a fee market is because an accelerated fee market created deliberately by decreasing the block size is not necessary.  But that's not to say that a small fee market emerging for a little while would be the end of the world, either.
@_date: 2016-02-25 04:39:05
So, it isn't true that after being unconfirmed for 72 hours, the transaction is dropped and the coin is returned to the sender?  When you say the lowest-fee transactions will likely remain unconfirmed forever, it seems like you're implying that the money is just lost in limbo, unrecoverable.
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:52:14
I agree that people should be aware of the current state of bitcoin, and if necessary, adjust their fees to pay 15 cents instead of 5, especially if they are sending an urgent transaction.  This situation does not spell doom for bitcoin.  Sorry, I'm just sick of seeing the thinly veiled block size/hard fork debate posts in every single thread on every single topic.

What are you talking about?  There is no bandwidth problem for the roadmap to solve until you raise the block size, that's the whole point.  Raising the block size *creates* the bandwidth problem, leading to node centralization.  So, yes, the roadmap does solve the bandwidth problem by resisting hard fork block size raises too soon, and not allowing the problem to occur in the first place.  I was only pointing out the incessant straw man argument that raising block sizes will be fine because modern hard drives are capable of storing the whole blockchain.  This argument has nothing to do with any of the otherwise valid concerns about raising the block size and demonstrates either ignorance or willful deception.

Thanks for the clarification...considering the information you've just provided, I think it's a bit disingenuous for you to be commenting everywhere on this sub that low-fee transactions will soon remain unconfirmed forever if we don't raise the block size, especially considering your involvement with Classic.  The false implications, political posturing, and half-truths are pretty transparent.

@_date: 2016-02-02 23:10:34
What doesn't solve what problem?  I was replying to a comment seemingly supporting big 10MB blocks with the stated reason being that modern hard drives can easily hold the whole blockchain.  This is a straw man argument I see all day every day here, nobody opposes raising the block size due to hard drive storage limitations, and yet somehow this argument continues to propagate here. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 03:05:27
Really?  I feel like I see it all the time.  When developers explain time and time again the risks and drawbacks of hard forks or raised block sizes, people sarcastically dismiss them as conspirators to strangle *adoption*, or when any mention of a temporary fee market comes up, the crowd gets riled up and predicts bitcoin's doom because this would strangle *adoption*...it's gotten to the point where any new, cool information posted about the future potential of bitcoin has the inevitable shitpost "not with 3 transactions per second, adoption will never happen" somewhere in the comment section.

It's the fourth time actually, but your point is still valid.
Edit: Just for those who might not be aware, in June 2011 it went to $30 and crashed down to like $2 and didn't surpass that previous ATH again for nearly 2 years.  Then it ran up to over $200 in April 2013 and crashed to around $65, and then we had the bubble up to $1200 7 months after that.  And then, as we all know, it took about 3 years and 4 months to surpass that previous ATH.

but your original implication was that it's irrelevant if bitcoin is killed because it has failed to scale, and now certain altcoins have better features like fast, cheap transactions...your statement is false, because these altcoins are no closer to solving scaling than bitcoin is...they are faster simply because nobody uses them.  If any of these coins' transaction volumes ever became a fraction of what is being done on the bitcoin network, they would run into the same issues.

This is the part where I say "you can't use it yet, its still in testnet", and you say its vaporware or something, right?  Look, you are the one making claims that bitcoin has failed to scale and is too expensive to use, and that therefore the better solution will be to use altcoins or centralized off chain services.  I'm simply pointing out what you already know, that decentralized second layer tech like LN will be the real solution.  
@_date: 2017-09-10 06:57:15

Your blog post says in bold letters "we will call the chain with the most accumulated difficulty bitcoin."   Then, almost as a footnote, theres the part about "maybe" taking other factors into consideration.  Calling the chain with the most accumulated difficulty bitcoin is NOT the same as letting the market decide.  It is the opposite, it is letting the miners alone decide.  Stop being disingenuous.
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:24:28
You are right, but I'm talking more about those people who invested just a little, and have seen incredible returns, but are still hodling.  Its way less crazy to invest 5-10k into bitcoin when you have very little to no net worth, than it is to bet 100k on blackjack or bitcoin.  I suspect some people with no net worth to speak of got inspired by bitcoin and sunk in 5-10k over a few years and now they are sitting with a relatively nice net worth, all in btc.

I don't think you're grasping what I'm talking about here.  Many people with little to no "net worth" to begin with chose bitcoin as their first investment, after their necessities were covered, and put in a very modest amount over a few years.  Putting $150 a month into bitcoin instead of spending it on bars or Starbucks or whatever isn't idiotic, and now some of those people have a nice little net worth, all in btc, that they wouldn't have had otherwise

This is a good point except you could also just buy bitcoin at market rate and sell for the premium on localbitcoins, so it's not really a great reason to get paid solely in bitcoin.  Not to mention that you would probably still be running afoul of money transmitter laws in the US.

There are lots of legitimate gripes about Coinbase, including their recent political posturing around the block size debate and many reports of poor user experience, but this just seems like a shitpost.  You give no information on the situation and you just seem like a shill.  Plus you use the sentence "I've seen people lose 25,000 dollars worth of BTC from bitcoin"

I think there is quite a bit of satire going on there, as well as a lot of trolls that just enjoy getting a rise.  Trolling is pretty common everywhere, not just in bitcoin, so I can understand where those come from...I think it's also just kind of a place where you can criticize bitcoin, the myriad of crazy characters involved, and whatever else without being downvoted into oblivion or censored.  It is a weird phenomenon for sure though.

I second this.  If you want to keep a substantial number of coins completely safe from attackers you either need to go with a paper wallet or a hardware wallet.  Trezor is awesome, it's still kind of expensive, there are others out there.  I have a Trezor and love it.  
@_date: 2016-05-07 06:57:14
Any clues on some of the best sites to pull this on?  Is it easier when depositing larger amounts (say $1k vs $100)?  For example, could I deposit $1k on one of these sites and only make very small bets so as not to lose all my money, then withdraw?  Or is it more like you have to bet a certain amount of money to unlock the bonus?  Just curious, haha
Edit: Also, do said sites make the bonus rules clear, or must you dig around a bit to find the fine print?

OPs post wasn't about "the blockchain" which is on topic.  It was about the incessant hand wringing and debate about banks and corporations trying to implement private permissioned blockchains (pretty much the definition of an altcoin) I think that all of these topics are pretty relevant to bitcoin despite whatever rules are in place for this subreddit, but the point stands...xt discussion should have been just as allowed as nasdaqcoin, citicoin, etc

Just in case you are ignorant, Core said the code for SegWit would be released in April, which it was.  Since April, it has been tested extensively before going live (which debunks another false argument from the trolls in r/btc, that SegWit is largely untested)  But I'm thinking you probably already knew this.
@_date: 2016-07-03 03:59:29
Maybe you don't have very good reading comprehension
In February:






SegWit code was released in April 2016...it is currently undergoing extensive testing and is close to going live...would you be happier if it went live immediately with no testing at all, putting this 10+billion dollar experiment at risk?  What is your point, anyway?
Edit:  I find the mental gymnastics displayed by r/btc trolls hilarious...some of you claim SegWit is dangerous because it is completely untested...some of you parse words and make fun of Core because SegWit isn't live yet (due to testing)...some of you do both?

I asked this question in another thread and got this answer:
Trezor is an embedded device, so it doesn't have a hard drive. SatoshiLabs doesn't have any info on flash memory on their website, so it seems they're just using the on-board memory with their CPU (ARM Cortex M3). This is outside the scope of this leak in particular, but at this point, I'm assuming the NSA has compromised just about everything we use on a hardware level (and every level above that), including Intel, AMD, and ARM CPUs. They've been doing this shit since at least the early 1990s, starting with the Clipper chip at the latest. Snowden said if a device is ever connected to a network, the NSA owns it, and I see no reason to think he's not telling the truth at this point. Basically, we're rapidly approaching a 1984 scenario (Samsung even makes telescreens now), and I'm not sure what can be done to stop it.
That being said, I doubt the NSA is interested in stealing your BTC. Also, there's absolutely no such thing as perfect security when you're talking about nation-state level adversaries. They have essentially limitless funding (if Congress doesn't give them enough money, just sell crack to the inner cities or guns to the cartels). It's not something I'd really worry about on a personal level unless you're funding ISIS or running a darknet market right now. It's terrifying what these fucking traitors will be able to do as Moore's Law continues to hold true, though. I think Orwell will be remembered as an optimist at this rate, if he's remembered at all.

And you could be right about poker specifically, I'm just thinking from a perspective of being previously puzzled on why third person games, or cartoony third person platformers like Lucky's Tale (basically the equivalent of Mario 64 in its time) would be cool in VR. After finally trying VR, I've realized it really enhances many experiences that you wouldn't imagine as typical VR use cases...one of my favorite games so far is basically a revamped version of the old arcade game Off Road (game is called BlazeRush), where you race little cars from an above view.  When it actually feels like you are "in" the world you are playing in, it opens up all kinds of things.  Plus, there are few truly social things you can do in VR at the moment, for now, so I think a VR poker room where you can look around and talk with other players could be really cool.  Of course, I might just still be in that WOWOWOW stage of VR at the moment where everything is amazing....even the home screen blows my mind when I put the thing on every time, lol
Edit:  There is a social room kind of program called Big Screen currently available where you are in a living room type of environment with other people and everyone has their own computer screen, you can kind of move around the room and check out what everyone is doing on their actual computer screen, whether it's watching a movie, working on a programming project, etc, while talking with anyone in your vicinity through the mic.....it tracks head movement so there are floating heads (other people) and you can tell which way they are looking in the virtual environment.  I kind of imagine a poker table where you can look around and also see where other people are looking, whether they are looking down and re-checking their cards currently, etc.
