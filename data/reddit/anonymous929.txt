Is there any reason someone couldn't put a satellite over China that beams internet to them, accept payments in Bitcoin, and bypass all of their censorship?

If you’re looking for a quick profit, like in a matter of days or weeks or months, there’s no way to know.
If you’re looking to hodl for a number of years because of Bitcoin’s “to the moon” potential, buy now.

The gist of it is that there’s an exact distance from the earth at which one orbit happens to take exactly 24 hours, which also happens to be the amount of time it takes the earth to rotate. So if you want a satellite to appear to the ground to remain in one spot without moving, you give it a circular orbit at that exact height at the equator in the same direction as the earth’s spin.

The government couldn’t tax $21 trillion if it tried. Everyone would just leave the country. Not to mention unfunded liabilities.
The government is going to have to print like crazy, which means the debt will be paid indirectly by everyone holding USD.

Nobody will have anything if the USD loses its value? Do resources, factories, raw materials, etc. disappear if a bunch of green paper disappears?
There will certainly be a world recession because the existing infrastructures dependent on the USD will have to transition, everyone who’s savings are in USD will lose a lot of money through inflation. But the thing that will screw everyone is the USD losing its value, so they’ll have a huge incentive to look for currencies that aren’t inflating, such as BTC.
On the contrary, a world recession will eventually be highly profitable for anyone that HODLs their BTC.

The government is on the road to bankruptcy.
The fact that Bitcoin isn’t backed by the government is why it’s valuable.

The only reason anyone would give bitcoin to a bank is if the bank is compensating you, like with interest.
Otherwise the bitcoin network and bitcoin wallets already perform all of the day to day functions that your bank performs for your USD.

You could be right, but the KJV definitely uses “ye” that way. The first one that comes to mind is “Be ye therefore perfect”.

1. Not thy keys, not thy bitcoin
2. Thou shalt run thine own node, lest thou desirest to be dependent on third parties for verification
3. Thou shalt not put more money in than thou canst afford to lose
4. Thou shalt not use hot (online) wallets to store meaningful amounts of money
5. Thou shalt help a fellow newbie with advice and explanations
6. Thou shalt not reuse public addresses
7. Thou shalt contribute to projects thou desirest to see succeeding (code review, testing, documentation writing, translations, donations, etc.)
8. Be thou humble. There are no experts on bitcoin. We are all learning and evolving.
9. If thou needest to look at the price, thou shalt zoom out
10. Be ye excellent to one another
No guarantees that my translation is perfect, but it's an improvement. I was hoping to find a use for "zoomest", but unfortunately it didn't work in that context. Maybe I screwed up the Bill and Ted's reference, but wouldn't that be mixing archaic speech with the future anyways?

Cloud mining: just don’t do it

Let’s say hypothetically Bitcoin did get something wrong: the electricity costs are too high, the number of transactions per block is too low, whatever. Which scenario is more likely: 
1. A different cryptocurrency drives Bitcoin to $0 because it got the parameters right
2. The Bitcoin network collectively agrees to continue using Bitcoin but with the corrected parameters
I think  simply because for many who are not yet initiated into the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrency are all essentially synonymous. Bitcoin’s name recognition can’t be beat. Even if scenario  represents a hard fork, such as Bitcoin Cash, you’re still better off buying Bitcoin now so that you have assets in the original chain and the new forked chain/currency.

If Bitcoin is destabilizing centralized currencies by merely existing, then that’s an admission that Bitcoin is a better currency.

When we see massive price changes and long term trends one way or the other, we read the news looking for an explanation. Was there a sudden announcement from a government somewhere that can be traced to this shock to the market?
The reality is that Bitcoin's price over time has very little to do with what's in the news, and everything to do with human behavior. Humans see the price falling, and they start selling. They see the price going up, and they start buying. News can certainly impact how people feel about where the price is going, but the long growth trend in 2017 and the long decline in 2018 are mostly just stories of lots of individuals making individual choices based on little more than their gut impressions. We've seen the price swing one way, we've seen it swing the other way, give it enough time and we'll see it swing back again, and so on. Ignore the news.

If they call me and legitimately need my personal information, I explain my rule, hang up, look the correct phone number up online, and call it to resolve the issue.

I’d be less willing to buy bonds or otherwise loan the government money if I knew that 100% of it had to be paid back by taxes rather than inflating the value of the currency. Not just because a change in taxes is more political and requires passing more boundaries, but also because by definition the government printing money to pay the debt they owe me means that the value of the money they’re paying me is lower.
@_date: 2018-11-13 02:13:41
My standard rule is that I only give personal information to companies I call, not the other way around.

The fact that the government can't print any to pay for their spending. They could barely tax it even if they tried.

You have your history backwards. The Fed was established in 1913, the Great Depression was 1929, and then the Fed began taking steps against the Gold Standard in 1933. The government was still converting USD to gold until 1971.
The Fed’s argument for existence is that they provide stability to the economy and security from bank runs, however in practice ever since the Fed was established the stock market has been through boom and bust cycles, with bubbles driven by low interest rates controlled by the Fed, the bubbles pop when the Fed has to raise rates again, and the Fed is forced to lower the rates again to boost the economy. On average those interest rates never quite go back up to what they were before, meaning the next big crash will probably put us into negative interest rates. Low interest rates drive debt, debt drives excessive resource consumption. If you’re concerned about climate change which you blame on human consumption of resources, then you should be concerned about government spending and the Fed driving consumerism through low rates. I could go on but it’s all tied together.
That was a rant. Let me start over. TL:DR: the free market is good. A free market in money is perhaps the most important free market an economy can and should have. Blockchain technology subverts government control in pretty much every possible way, and those of us who distrust the government think that’s a good thing.

Yeah that part didn't really make sense to me either. What keeps anyone from cheating is that everyone else has a copy of the ledger and can immediately call you out if you lie.

They want their stock broker to package it like any other investment. They probably have no idea that you just get a wallet and go buy some. Just owning Bitcoin like everyone else is the best way to invest.
