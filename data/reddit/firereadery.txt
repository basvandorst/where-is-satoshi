Do you believe your friend? If so, you should buy. If you wait for bitcoin to drop lower you are just being greedy because you want to optimise the gains.
Anyways, I would not blindly trust anyone. Read up on bitcoin and make an informed decision you are comfortable with.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:29:23
I think people are in relatively low spirits because they see the current situation and forget that there are hundreds and hundreds of developers that are working on improving bitcoin right now. Various teams are simultaneously working on lightning, companies are launching extremely powerful sidechains such as Rootstock and core developers are also hard at work on a variety of improvements. 
The problems is that many people think that bitcoin stands still and will not improve. They assume that bitcoin is a sitting duck and nobody is doing anything. Believe me, if someone feels the urge to do something it is all the involved developers and parties.
Unfortunately bitcoin is too decentralised to have a proper marketing team that constantly publishes roadmaps and updates the community on the current progress. That my ease you mind. But don’t think for a second they are complacent.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:57:38
I am not only talking about LN. LN is not even being developed by the core developers but six different teams working in parallel on it. The core developers are working on other measures.
Speaking of LN though... don’t you agree that centralisation on higher layers is better than centralisation on lower ones? Once you take measures that increase centralisation in the base layer, the ones above cannot reduce it. So better do it the other way round.
@_date: 2018-01-05 05:32:50
The trouble with bits is that it’s also used for other stuff. Your transaction fees are tied to size for instance. Imagine someone saying: “I’m sending 8000 bits and the fee is set to 250 sat/byte... but I’m paying way more??” or “Woah, I’m adding a 8kbit transaction to the blockchain”.
I agree we need to find an abbreviation but a word commonly used in computer science to quantify information is bound to cause some confusion, especially since to fully understand bitcoin you will be confronted with bits and bytes (blocksize, transaction fees, the protocol itself has reserved bits). I’d rather we find another word or we make learning bitcoin unnecessarily more confusing.

That would be an amazing idea imho! If this community is able to make Andreas a rich man, I am sure many would put their money where their mouth is and financially support bounties.
I would participate in bounties such as:
- The first 5 merchants that implement LN on mainnet
- The first exchange that supports LN
- The first mainnet iOS client that is LN compatible
- The first LN implementation that officially goes to mainnet (even as an alpha)
Why don’t you do a separate Reddit post with this proposal? I reckon it merits more exposure as it could be a great initiative that could help all non developers to actively contribute!

Core supports Segwit but not through the gui. They wanted to have that but given the whole segwit2x chaos they had to prioritise network-security related features and push the Segwit gui back. Now they are working on it and it looks close to being ready.

So out of all altcoins you think that bitcoin cash matches those criteria the best? What about litecoin which is very close to the original design and has a block time of only 2.5 minutes? That’s way faster confirmations than bitcoin cash!
I’m not trying to promote alts, I am just trying to understand why out of all altcoins you picked bitcoin cash as being the best altcoin.

Ok, lets do some adversarial thinking. What could the US do to stop bitcoin? Disclaimer: I do not advocate such action but it is important to understand what could realistically happen.
Within a country it’s quite simple to seriously damage bitcoin. You could simply ban companies from accepting bitcoin as a payment. This would result in online shops not being able to accept it and POS systems in physical stores would not support it. Any major chain would not take bitcoins and any smaller company would be afraid to say yes to any stranger asking “do you take bitcoin?”.
So, while it is impossible to block, you could make it practically impossible for widespread adoption.
Second measure they could take: while bitcoin is not a permitted mean of exchange and payment, Libra could be allowed. So in fact you would stop bitcoin and favour a corporate and backdoored competitor. That in turn would push the vast majority of businesses to accept Libra while shunning bitcoin. And the 95% of sheep customers would hail its benefits. “Oh, Libra is so cool and convenient, everybody accepts it. Plus Facebook has my back and reverses the transactions to those scammers that try to steal my money. And they also directly report my spendings to the IRS. How convenient. We truly live in the future now.”
The black market might keep using bitcoin, but you won’t be able to pay your mechanic in bitcoin under such a scenario.
Sure, everyone always says that bitcoin cannot be blocked. And that’s true. But DO NOT underestimate the damage a major government could do to it. Do not laugh about a governments inability to block bitcoin. That’s naive.
@_date: 2019-07-22 13:20:38
That’s a highly underrated comment. The day that a blockchain supports virtually free transactions stored within huge blocks, I will store data on there! Transactions must cost something, otherwise the thing will just be a huge resource hog...
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:19:37
Sure... I was however wondering how to do it practically. There are so many bitcoin powered services and devices (such as ATMs). How could one safely deploy such an upgrade? I think it would need many many months...
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:18:50
I get your point however there is one thing that is also important: once you increase the blocksize you can’t go back. Every small element that decreases decentralisation or privacy on the base layer carries through all other layers. You are practically settling for something that cannot be undone.
I think the approach of putting higher centralisation and less privacy in exchange for more speed and capacity on a level above the blockchain is not only sane, it’s the right thing to do in the long term.
If you are in bitcoin for the short term gains, sure, then a blocksize increase may help right now. But if you are looking at the long game you see all developers working for a long-term solution. You have things such as instant (almost) zero fee payments coming. Alts may be cool for now, but they will have to catch up on lightning. 10 Minute per Block? With lightning the transaction is carried out instantly. Yes, given the current situation alts may even overtake bitcoin in real world usage. But the Day lightning works there will be a very strong technical argument to why bitcoin is superior. And again, it’s already working very well on the testnet so it’s not even that far off!
All good things require patience. I admit I am inpatient as well, but that’s only when I look at the price.

We have them. We just need patience. It’s not as if tomorrow all lightning devs would stop and throw themselves at another coin.
It’s a shame that many see Bitcoin as a short term investment vehicle and price is the only measure of success.
That being said, I sometimes get a tad impatient too. But great minds are working at real solutions and they are really close. We just need patience.

@_date: 2017-12-09 13:06:29
I see your point but be careful not to underestimate the power of the lawmakers. Their simplest way of severely damaging bitcoin would be to just make a law that forbids any company to accept or promote bitcoin.
Sure, they can’t block it or enforce it... it’s p2p. But believe me... if businesses are banned from accepting bitcoin it’s going to be tough. It becomes useless as an official method of payment and pushed into some black markets. And then it just becomes easier and easier to also criminalise anyone caught possessing bitcoin. 
Sure, that’s unfair... but don’t think just because bitcoin is p2p it is safe from serious troubles.
That said... I don’t believe any western government would do that. That’s too late now.

Not really. You know, if at every opportunity we spend bitcoin rather than fiat, we legitimise it. Even if the retailer then just converts it into fiat he will start looking at data and say “damn, we sure need to keep that bitcoin payment option, it is x% of our sales”. At some point some supplier may even offer them a discount if they pay in bitcoin. And they will go “damn, we could get a 5% discount if we pay the coffee beans in bitcoin. Aren’t we getting paid in bitcon? Can we keep some to pay our suppliers?”. And if Starbucks accepts bitcoin but changes them to fiat, maybe one of their competitors will want to accept bitcoin as well... and maybe they won’t convert back everything.
My point: If we just go about hodling and think that retailers converting bitcoin to fiat are useless, we miss how important even this simple step is.

I understand you point of view but, as you can clearly see, many don’t. Don’t you think there is more to it than just them being all stupid? Everyone has reasons for any actions. Some may choose an iPhone simply because they have money to burn and the convenience of knowing the apps are extremely vetted is worth them the inconvenience of loosing flexibility. Some people prefer the design and are happy to spend the money because they have enough.
There are people who buy an expensive Swiss watch while a cheap Casio would be more precise and cost only a fraction. I personally may not do that, but calling them stupid would be extremely patronising and close minded to their perception of the world.

@_date: 2018-05-11 14:40:00
You are talking about your experience and you use that lens to infer about other people. You see someone with an iPhone and you assume he is an idiot because you can’t fathom why someone could like it. Now you have the logical inference “iPhone -&gt; moron”.
That is prejudice in my book.
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:56:33

I agree to some part but I’d argue that the world is a magnificent place and curiosity allows us to grow. I found out about bitcoin because I heard of it and didn’t dismiss it as some kind of nerd money. It seemed fishy at first but it proved to be extremely useful. There are reasons for preferring some goods over others and I feel it’s always wrong to dismiss people as stupid just because they take one action over another one. Everyone has different backgrounds, preferences and reasons. Sure, obeying your guts makes things easier and is an important factor when time is of the essence. But that will not allow for personal growth, only for prejudice.

@_date: 2018-05-14 16:44:26
I completely agree with you. We may keep proclaiming that bitcoin cannot be censored... but one fact remain: no bitcoin business can set foot over there, no merchant will be able to accept bitcoin in Zimbabwe and small business won’t be able to stick a “bitcoin accepted here” on their door. That will effectively stop many honest citizens from using bitcoin, let alone learning about it. Unfortunately.
I know I will get downvotes for this, but I am convinced that governments can do great harm to bitcoin adoption.
That being said, Zimbabwe is a relatively small country and if the government sees bitcoin being successful all around the world they won’t be able to keep it forbidden fort long.
@_date: 2018-05-08 06:44:18
You did a great job! I am testing it right now. The feedback from my side is that it is not for the everyday user. The software is still relatively slow, error messages are cryptic, a newbie would have no idea what a channel is and that he has to first open one. I don’t want to diminish your work, on the contrary, I feel you are doing great work and I am sure CoinClip will only get better.
I just dream of a wallet that is so simple a newbie would not need to know anything about channels or connections. It would just be “here is your balance on your checking account (lightning) and your savings account (BTC). Do you want to send, receive or transfer between checking and saving? That would be my dream LN wallet....

Because even if you know that a 4K television set is going to cost way less in five years you still buy it now-ish. And food... you simply need it now, so you'll pay.
Sure, hording may hurt the economy right now but it is delayed spending. I think countries should be happy if the saving rate of the general population increases and social costs decrease because people can afford that medical treatment.
In my view inflation is just forcing people to spend now so as to get the economy some kind of instant gratification... but encourages unwise behaviour, debt and a critically low saving rate. And the countries love it because it's basically like an invisible tax.
That's my take on it, I know I may be a loner :-)
@_date: 2017-03-17 09:47:47
Think of it from another point of view. The underlying blockchain is like a huge shared database. It is being used as a huge ledger but others are already using it to permanently encode data. Wikileaks even wrote the whole cablegate leak to the bitcoin blockchain.
Bitcoin is great for money transfer but if it is too cheap, people will use it to store their stuff on. Everything ranging from illegal material, personal backups and porn. And that's the problem with increasing the blocksize indefinitely. There will never be almost free money transfer because if it's too cheap, people will hog it with other stuff.
Resources are used as they become available. Once you could fit a computer game onto a floppy disc. As soon as CD-Rom's became available, the size of a game jumped to 600 MB... because there was cheap space available. I am convinced that the same applies to the blockchain. If we had 32 Mb blocks right now, it would be attractive to place any kind of crap such as pirated songs on the blockchain. Or a frame of a live cam every 10 minutes. Stored forever. And the price for each transaction would go up again...
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:13:59
That would at least show their hand. Many claim that miners did not upgrade to 0.13 because upgrades are difficult, new compilers are needed and whatnot. If we see miners adopting 0.14+ features but not signalling for Segwit at least we know where they stand.

Lower prices will affect the inefficient and small miners first. It is actually a cleanse that benefits the larger miners!
@_date: 2017-02-27 05:38:00
Consider that if you really want VISA level transaction volumes you would also need to solve the issue that it currently takes 10 minutes on average for a confirmation.
That means there is no real way around off-chain transactions / lightning networks. The thought that increasing the blocksize would transform bitcoin into the magic VISA competitor is a bit too simplistic...

Your points are all good but they don’t consider that Satoshi may have actively tried to obfuscate his writing style.

I completely agree about the potential ambiguity we find in our common language. But we are also talking about money. Something so essential to our existence.
We always keep saying that everybody should learn how bitcoin works before putting money in it. It's a new concept and thus it's so easy for a new user to get hacked, to get scammed or to loose everything. Think about the implications if someone puts his savings into bitcoin and makes one tiny mistake? We are talking about money and there are bound to see people with a low IQ using it.
I am happy to use an alternative name for fractions of a bitcoin but why deliberately use a word that is used for other things in the domain of cryptocurrencies? We can decide that right now and yet of all the options we chose something ambiguous!

I said it in another comment but I think it’s worth repeating:
Before even discussing at what’s IN the hard fork, we should at HOW it is supposed to happen. I cannot in good conscience consider any hard fork that expects all participants within a distributed network to update the software within three months and with no replay protection.
We are putting a networks worth billions at stake. We are putting bitcoins reputation at stake.
It may be the best compromise, it may have features that could catapult bitcoin to the moon. I don’t care about the contents, I have to stop considering Segwit2X after reading the update plan. Anyone should.
@_date: 2017-01-22 15:58:56
My wallet has a 256 AES bit encryption. Does it mean that I have to pay 256 bits? Bitcoin is so new and confusing but why should I pay for encrypting my wallet? Who should I pay?

There is one more important factor that keeps being overlooked: if some miners really use covert ASICBOOST, they have a big incentive to switch towards mining BCH very soon.
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:38:18
If ViaBTC uses covert asicboost, then they have no reason to hope that Segwit2x is a success. Their optimal course of action is to switch to mine BCH on the 22. August. That’s when Segwit activates on BTC (thus disabling asicboost there) and that’s also when difficulty resets. And, by chance, it seems that it resets on BCH the same day as well.

Honestly it is irresponsible to do a hard fork in 3 months and throw all caution out of the window. I would have probably supported a well planned hard fork with a timeframe of 18 months or so. But 3 months? No replay protection? Can you really support a reckless timeframe with no real risk mitigation?
There has been no software update been successfully pushed through any network in so little time. Not even Tesla or iPhone software updates (which pretty much actively remind you to take action) are universally applied to all devices within three months. 
Yet here for some reason many think that three months is enough time for node owners to learn about 2x, go to some non-core repository, trust it, download a new software, install it and run it. And ah, even if there are still some old clients somewhere, there will be no issues. So let’s not plan in any protections.
This is reckless and unrealistic.
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:38:39
No reason?
Who is irresponsible here? Someone expecting the whole bitcoin network to update within 3 months? Without replay protection?
Not even the windows security patches or android updates hit all devices within three months, let alone six.
So you think anyone refusing a safe upgrade is irresponsible and playing chicken? I may very well be for a well though out hard fork with a clear plan and safety measures. But not even replay protection? Are you really calling yourself a cautious and responsible user?
@_date: 2017-08-09 03:53:35
If BIP148 was not the catalyst, then the NYA would have simply put Segwit as well as the 2MB HF into one single hard fork. The incredible rush and added complexity to separate both and create a complex activation mechanism is a testament to the fact that BIP148 had its role.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:02:59
It’s not only about that. It’s a reckless timeframe! Core developers could probably kill Segwit2X quite easily by announcing a hard fork to 2MB (plus other items off the Hard Fork wish list) in 18 months.
That would be a meaningful timeframe to slowly update clients, prepare for any unforeseen issues and do a clean transition. But 3 Months? No way!
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:04:40
10 days, I was rounding down :)
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:16:19
And what eight year plan is the Segwit2X plan based on? The one without any protective measures?
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:41:30
You are looking at the contents of SegWit2x rather than looking at how it will come about. If you understand how they plan do deploy SegWit2x you won’t even get to debate the contents.
Without looking at what SegWit2x plans to achieve, look at how it is supposed to happen: a hard fork that takes place three months from now and has no protective measures such as replay protection.
Believe me, it’s impossible that all users (by that I not only mean miners but include merchants, ATM’s wallets, private node owners etc) switch to a software that has to be downloaded from somewhere else than the official Bitcoin repository, needs to be trusted, has to be installed, tested and run. It is furthermore reckless to even think about a fork that has no protective measures such as for instance replay protection.
As you notice I am not even touching whether the SegWit2x is a good upgrade or not. That debate should not even take place until a clear and safe upgrade plan is proposed. At that point I’ll happily discuss the merits and disadvantages of a further blocksize doubling.
It’s our money after all!
@_date: 2017-08-21 04:45:38
I think you have misunderstood me. I am not against a hard fork. I am just against a hard fork that follows an unrealistic timeframe and for whatever reason doesn’t implement any security measures. Even if the risk is small, we are talking about a decentralised network that spans the planet and is worth billions. This is our money that is being put at risk.
Again, this is not against hard forks. This is against badly executed ones.
@_date: 2017-08-21 05:10:30
The thing is the following: Microsoft is unable to push security patches to all users within three months. And they can use pop ups, reminders and pretty much force the user to update. Even they are unable.
In Bitcoin this is far more difficult. We are bound to see users using old code years from now. That’s why we need a clean and safe hard fork. Not some code that has been cobbled together in short time, that expects all participants of the network to quickly update and offers no replay protection.
Things are bound to go wrong. The reputation of bitcoin is at risk. Our money is at risk.
That’s why soft forks are generally superior. That’s why hard forks require careful planning, sufficient lead times and, above all, replay protection.
@_date: 2017-01-23 10:45:38
It confuses a user who wants to understand how bitcoin works. That may prompt to stop learning more ("ah damn, what the hell, let me buy some bitcoins") and may then cause the person to do critical mistakes. 
I agree that it will affect few users and I agree that probably we two would be smart and determined enough to read on. But why risk it? Why assume that everybody is as smart? Why induce a hurdle that could easily be avoided using another word that has no double meaning in the domain of cryptocurrencies? 
Don't get me wrong, I love the concept of using a catchy word to describe sub-units, but of ALL words one could come up with, "bit" is an ambiguous choice.
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:54:44
It has nothing to do with doubling the blocksize. For me the issue is that the timeframe is not conservative at all. 3 months for the whole bitcoin network to update? No major software release manages that. Not Apple with the iPhones, not Microsoft with windows security patches, not Tesla with the latest software. Hoping that the whole network updates in 3 months is absolutely absurd. As would 6. As would probably 9.
To make matters worse, there are not even security measures that ensure a smooth and safe transition. There is for instance no replay protection.
That’s what this whole post was about: core would never do such a recklessly rushed hard fork. The matter is not even the blocksize increase, the whole HF plan of Segwit2x is so incredibly dangerous and irrationally  rushed... it feels as like if there were a couple of children saying “we want 2 MB blocks now!” without thinking about how to do it.
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:50:51
You post this claim in rapid succession to almost every comment thread but never elaborate on it. I suggest you create a post on the topic so we can discuss why you think that LN (that is not in production yet) creates so many problems.
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:21:45
Well, there is one reason why it shouldn’t move forward in the current form. As you don’t want to wreak havoc and given that the mempool is quite empty right now you’ll surely agree to a less rushed approach. The current SegWit2x approach is extremely rushed (its impossible that all nodes update until November, issues are bound to happen) and there is no proper replay protection. These things are bound to wreck havoc. Before even considering SegWit2x and what it aims to do we should reject it due to its absolutely reckless and rushed deployment plan.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:15:28
Unfortunately those that use covert asicboost have all reason to ditch Segwit... 
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:52:54
I think I would support such a proposal by the core developers. But only if it is well planned, has a long lead time (e.g. 18 months) and offers mechanisms that minimise the risk (replay protection).
We are talking about a distributed system spanning the whole planet and worth billions. This is the last place for careless rushing. In my opinion the plan from the Segwit2X proponents is unrealistic and will create unnecessary bad media coverage (people using old clients, replay attacks, general confusion)
@_date: 2017-08-17 07:41:25
It would be great for bitcoin if they were caught. It would establish the idea amongst lawmakers and politicians that “you can’t really use bitcoin for nefarious purposes as it is traceable after all”.

@_date: 2017-08-21 04:06:09
So let’s go on and take the risk? There have been very few hard forks and none on such a successful and large network.
Just because you never had a car accident, let’s not put on seat belts?
Now just because someone makes some assumptions and doesn’t care about risks it’s ok to throw all caution out the window and fork without any protective measures?
That’s my point of contention. I am not even debating the blocksize doubling. For all you know I may be very happy with it.
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:48:10
You need to be very careful about these things because there are many indirect risks. People may find out who you are, where you live. They may use this to run scams, break in or do worse (kidnappings or whatever). I’m not here to scare you but to make you aware that you basically said “look, there are 400 BTC, try to get them”.
400 BTC is a lot of motivation... you just painted a target on your digital forehead. Never post such information with a real account. I strongly advise you to delete your post ASAP.
@_date: 2017-08-09 03:46:54
I get your argument. I am however confused by “we promised” and “we lied”. Lying is a pretty strong and loaded verb that implies malice. Can you expand how we as users promised something and how we as users lied? I don’t recall promising something and don’t recall being dishonest about anything.
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:49:40
Before even discussing what’s IN the hard fork, we should look at HOW it is supposed to happen. I cannot in good conscience consider any hard fork that expects all participants within a distributed network to update the software within three months and with no replay protection.
We are putting a networks worth billions at stake. We are putting bitcoins reputation at stake.
It may be the best compromise, it may have features that could catapult bitcoin to the moon. I don’t care about the contents, I have to stop considering Segwit2X after reading the update plan. Anyone should.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:18:30
The signaled acceptance for the plan to activate Segwit and then fork to larger blocks. But the NYA did not specify how it is done. The way the current implementation achieves the block size increase (e.g. without replay protection) may very well cause reconsiderations.
We shall see, but in the current form many miners can realistically back out of the deal and say “there is no client that implements the NYA in a safe way, thus we have no means to uphold the agreement”.
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:52:43
Exactly. That’s why the NYA agreement is meaningless as rational miners will drop it in a heartbeat if they think it’s not profitable.
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:40:08
Pardon my honest ignorance. I think Zap is really cool, will it however be possible to get a truly seamless integration of lightning payments? Will it be possible for a user to just send some funds to an address without having to open channels, set various IPs etc?

Asicboost will be disabled by Segwit. So just wait a week and it will be off. That may then however prompt the affected miners to support other chains which still allow covert asicboost.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:46:44
First of all we don’t know who will be the majority chain. Right now many miners switched to BCH, so who knows what they will prefer come November. We have seen bitwalla reneging the agreement, how many will do so in the future? Maybe everyone is happy mining Bitcoin Cash? Maybe the majority is unhappy about SegWit2x because first implementations of lightning are showing promise? Nobody can foresee the future. Anyone doing a hard fork should not be so smug to expect to be the majority chain and thus not implement replay protection. Things change. For better or for worse.
It is as if I would not put on safety belts just because I expect not to crash. Is that a sensible and safe approach? Would you entrust someone who is that careless with your savings? Your money?
Secondly, bitcoin core developers are coherent in that they profess safe development practices. Adding replay protection would mean to do a hard fork and ask all nodes to update software within three months. I am sure most agree that this is unrealistic, no major software developer is able to get all clients to update within such a short timeframe. As however SegWit2x clients are still in development and embraces the hard fork approach, it is most sensible to add it there. Minimum effort to do it right now, minimum risk for everybody, win win!
@_date: 2017-08-26 05:45:31
A few lone developers that contribute to the core code are proposing a pow change. You proved my point that it’s not “core” that wants to change POW but some developers that participate in writing core code. You know, as strange as this may sound to many, open source development has many indipendently operating developers.
Each with his/her ideology. Everyone can contribute. There is however no central voice for core. So Luke and Eric are free to code up a POW change. But saying that this is “core” pushing for a POW is a misinterpreting the situation.

I think 'bit' is a somewhat confusing denomination as it somehow implies smallest possible unit... and it can be confused with the bits in a computer. I personally think that if someone tells me "send me 0.7 bits" it would just throw me off. 
Wouldn't mBTC be more useful as "milli" (as in the decimal system) implies "1/1000"? We could then talk about nano, deci, micro etc while staying coherent.
This is a honest question, I am not trying to go against this "bit" word that I have already seen thrown around, I am just curious about why everyone thinks it's so practical while I personally just find it confusing.

I have a possibly very dumb question. Is it true that if A and B use lightning, any transaction between can only start with an invoice? That is if A wants to send money to B, B has to send an invoice first? Or can A also send some money to B without B having to create an invoice?
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:20:08
It’s not difficult to increase blocksize. It however is very difficult to roll out an update through the whole network in such a limited timeframe.
Again: Microsoft isn’t able to push a security patch to all machines in such a short amount of time. Why should anyone expect that in a decentralised currency worth billions it is somehow different?
And if it really HAS to be that quick (as if we had some sort of incredible emergency) why not include replay protection? Why plan for an unsafe upgrade?
@_date: 2017-08-21 04:01:07
That’s the problem. Assumptions. Just because some people assume Segwit2X will be the legitimate chain they think they can just throw out all caution? What they have not considered is a large amount of uninformed users that within three months will open their bitcoin client and for some reason be on a different chain. It’s unrealistic to get everyone to update within three months. Even Microsoft is unable to push out important security patches to all machines in three months.

Next to that, one should never forget that while you may be able to afford a cheap hard drive and good connection, some places around the globe have way lower income and internet is capped. So increasing the blocksize max not directly affect you but will definitely affect many people in other countries. As we are talking about a global currency, that really matters.
That’s unfortunately a common fallacy here. It’s easy to assume everyone on reddit is accustomed to the comforts of the west but in reality the world is an incredibly diverse place and such differences are enormous.

What do you think about my point that it is impossible to bring the whole network to download some binaries from a new repository, install it and run it within three months? Do you agree that there is at least some degree of risk and that you always should be prudent, especially when we talk about a distributed network worth billions? I mean, it’s my and your money at risk. Do you support the SegWit2x taking that gamble?

Core is not talking about changing POW. A minority of core developers are.

@_date: 2018-06-03 05:27:28
Right. The thought that increasing the blocksize would solve all capacity issues would be akin to try scaling the internet by opening up all the roads and just putting additional copper lines down there. Internet got as efficient and fast as it is now through new technologies (e.g. fibre), improved compression algorithms, better and cheaper CPU’s to support that... just doubling the phone lines would only have helped a small bit.

While I do really appreciate your energy, I personally don’t know if I would use a service different than fiverr, even if it would support lightning. I find the fee on fiverr relatively small for jobs that are anyways quite inexpensive. In exchange I get some kind of customer support, I have an app that works well, a reliable website and a huge selection of professionals for all kinds of strange jobs. Strangely enough, the fee actually gives me some confidence that I am dealing with some sort of serious service.
I am not saying I would never use your site but I just want to give you a sincere warning: be prepared to spend a lot on marketing to make your platform a credible alternative. Validate your idea by spending as little as you can... and be prepared to accept it you find out the market is not interested. I see so many founders enamoured with their idea that they can’t accept facts... don’t do that mistake.
That being said, I am not saying you are doing things wrong, just that I probably wouldn’t use your service even if it worked halfway decently. I’m just one voice out of millions and you may ignore me. But if you hear my opinion more than once, start asking yourself if there is any truth to that. Best of luck!

Well, they were competent enough to have some kind of setup that allows them to cover the losses. Granted, it’s not something that should have happened, but they have a plan B. In my eyes that is not really total incompetence.

Look at the OSI model and the difference of issues you encounter on the various layers. You will notice that even though YouTube allows you to stream video in “almost” real time, your local network connection pipes it into many many L2 frames limited to 1500 bytes.
This is why it should be any different (since you asked): YouTube is based on those small frames such as Lightning is based on the oh-so inefficient bitcoin. But as you see, the limitations are addressed by the various layers that, to put it simply, solve lower level problems in smart ways. If a lower layer has some limitations, the ones above do not necessarily share them but often address them.
So saying that lightning will have high fees just because bitcoin has high fees is a wrong assumption. You could open a channel now and keep it open for 5 years. Assume that then the fees on the base layer increase dramatically: you can exchange those bitcoins through the open lighting channel thousands of times back and forth. And for that you would pay virtually zero fees. It’s all more complex than that but my point is: your premise that lightning carries over the same disadvantages that bitcoin has is a tad too simplistic.
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:10:32
I think spamming bitcoin is actually often misunderstood. $5 transaction fees only apply to those that want the transaction to go through, not to the spammer.
If you want to spam bitcoin, you broadcast thousands of transactions with such a low fee that you know they will never be confirmed. That way the mempool grows and the general fees rise.
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:43:14
I think Segwit 2X is the needless risk. It was developed with no replay protection in place and it follows a timeframe that is extremely tight. Even if the developers now supported 2X, it is unrealistic to expect everyone to upgrade within three months.
Such things don’t happen. A software rollout on a distributed system such as bitcoin in three months is not really possible.
I may agree to a hard fork that is well planned, protected by good code and replay protection. But the expectation that everyone updates until November is imho the needless risk.
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:09:09
This is something that gets repeated very often. But if they are so keen on making money with their offchain solutions, where are they? They had years to further their evil plot and write those offchain solution, yet I don’t see them.

@_date: 2019-06-02 06:03:39
That’s if you assume bitcoin stays put in terms of technology. Fortunately it doesn’t. Lightning is maturing, Schnorr signature aggregation is on the horizon, more and more exchanges are batching their transactions. When internet was new, YouTube was unthinkable. But the technology did not stand still. That’s something the mainstream often ignores: bitcoin is not a static concept but keeps improving. Bitcoin from 5 years ago is not the same it is today.

It depends where you live, but if taxes are not an issue you can just contact an exchange, tell them you are a whale and have them sell your stash in units of 10 per hour. It would take a while but it wouldn’t crash the price. They are usually quite glad to support you.

I am actually even more confused as to why you said no above? When reading about gold silver certificates I noticed they claim to be backed by physical assets. If they can, I presume we could as well? How come you said we could not?

I think that Bitcoin itself would not be weakened but the claim of it being backed by gold would. 
I agree that this is not something that we need, but I would find it funny if we could somehow claim that Bitcoin is backed by gold as well.
@_date: 2019-12-10 05:47:58

@_date: 2019-12-10 05:11:02
That’s an insightful answer. Can you elaborate a bit on the reasons? I am genuinely curious what allows an asset to be called “backed by gold”.
@_date: 2019-04-29 08:49:37
One of the reasons is that, contrary to the beliefs of many, the bitcoin ecosystem is not standing still and set in stone. Segwit came (and effectively expanded the space available within a block), many exchanges implemented batching and so forth. And there are many more improvements that will improve the overall efficiency even further.
@_date: 2017-04-29 16:32:02
The more serious and largely adopted bitcoin becomes the less it should try to be the most innovative cryptocurrency. The more money is in bitcoin and the less rushed any major change should be. 
Ideally in the future other cryptocurrencies will be a testbed for innovation while bitcoin follows a few years later... once we know the new features are tested. I am all for a scalable bitcoin, I however also think we should not cram in every innovation as soon as it happens just to be leaders at all cost. Sooner or later we need to grow up and protect the value by being wise and careful.
Right now I think it's wise to see the benefits of Segwit on litecoin and then adopt them in bitcoin.

I think this one might be interesting. UASF on Litecoin would have been less contentious as around 70% of miners were already for Segwit. However in Vertcoin the miner support is less than 50% (as far as I can tell). 
That means we can witness a much more risky and contentious UASF. Which will teach us important lessons, one way or another!

I like the same cautious approach when thinking about my money. What is a year of delay in rolling out major overhauls in the grand scheme of things? I prefer bitcoin being the safe asset that innovates, yes, but with a certain degree of caution. That's value too, especially for people putting in their life savings.
Let the other alt coins try out new stuff. We can incorporate it if it works well.

Of course I do. I was just laying out how low fees and quick transaction times (compared to other payment methods) for cross-border transactions already make bitcoin a great global currency. But yeah, of course there is more to being the one global currency. Such as the fact of being decentralised and not controlled by any central bank. However speed and low fees are important factors.
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:05:47
Well I guess you agree that for international transactions it is already superior to most traditional banking solutions which generally have relatively high fees. That simple thing makes bitcoin a truly amazing cross-border currency. Next, look at things that are on the horizon such as lightning.
It is in the nature of things: if there is ever a free global blockchain based currency I can assure you I would use it to back up my whole computer (I would encorde the data in thousands of transactions)...

I really love LN but I feel there is no proper communication going on. I am not aware of progress on the various implementations, developers keep saying that LN is ready “soon”.

I‘d argue that Bitcoin is a protocol for communicating and exchanging value whereas a Nokia is a device. Http is still here, TCP/IP is still there...  and the Nokia 3310 would still be able to call the latest iPhone. I would not compare a protocol to a terminal or a device.
Sure, there are better alternatives to HTTP but the latter kept being improved and what we use today is an improved version of the original protocol. I can very well imagine Bitcoin staying for a long time. Not forever... but for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:41:42
I am saying something else. When billions are at stake (as are my savings) we should do changes in a safe way.
For instance: why not add replay protection to SegWit2X and use a longer timeframe for deployment? Who do things in a rushed rather than a safe way? Do we currently have a gun to our heads and need to take needless risks?
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:47:12
That’s the magic of it, isn’t it? Lightning settles on the blockchain from time to time but in regular use you can pay other parties without having to wait for the blockchain to store the payment!

First of all: you seem to be thinking solely about the price and potential increases. Please never invest in anything unless you understand it well enough. Once you know how bitcoin really works, you understand what’s ahead you know the advantages and disadvantages, you have an idea about the risks ... once that happens you will be able to assess on your own whether crypto is something that you think will go up or not.
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:26:46
How did you establish that value for the most likely bottom?
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:35:08
Unfortunately with Revolut, Robinhood and similar services you usually can neither transfer bitcoin in nor out. Doing it that way allows them to drastically simplify their whole AML because you basically trade within their cocoon. They have full transparency about what you do and they prevent you from using bitcoins for anything else than trading.
It’s fun for a quick speculative buy but it’s ignoring the USPs for bitcoin.

Well, let those that view bitcoin purely as a speculative asset sell. And for me, to be honest, thats not the end of the world. The fork threats are gone, rogue miners seem to behave, lightning, schnorr, Mast are being worked on. I rarely had such a good feeling about bitcoin. Let the speculators go, most probably don’t event know how bitcoin works... bitcoin may have halved in price but it has for sure not halved in progress!

@_date: 2017-10-05 14:47:52
It should be open for scrutiny under every aspect. But we must be prudent. Hard forks can be discussed, even controversial topics such as doubling the blocksize. As you say, nothing is sacred and we should not grasp at satoshis vision. But given that bitcoin is an extremely important and valuable project, we must be prudent.
For me prudence means being patient, testing a lot, and not rushing anything due to politics, fear, spite or greed. Which I currently only see in the approach taken by the core developers. And I praise them highly for their unwavering prudence.
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:31:18
I am more worried about bitcoin atms working on one chain, wallets sending bitcoins on another one, non-techies downloading the official client and being confused, replay mayhem... 
Getting every user, every device, every node to upgrade within less then two months is unrealistic. There will be many unaware users loosing money using “bitcoin” because there are diffident interpretations and implementations.
You may say that all is fine. I think that’s very optimistic. I believe it is extremely dangerous to just skip strong replay protection and deploy on short timescales because “it will be fine”.
@_date: 2018-03-25 06:03:06
That sound interesting but can you elaborate on what you mean when you say blockchain technology? That’s nothing more than a technology for storing data in a distributed way... Couldn’t you use a distributed database for that? Or are you doing something based on a cryptocurrency / bitcoin?

Successfully driving a car does not require you to wear seat belts. It’s opt-in. And to be honest, I don’t care if you wear them while you drive. As long as you don’t put other people at risk.
Here we are however talking about a billion dollar decentralised crypto currency. SegWit2x is putting my savings at risk because someone thought it would be ok not to put in safety mechanisms. I am sorry but I can’t support any initiative that hard forks in a reckless way, puts my money at risk, rushes things. Even if there may be merits, the way it’s done is too risky for me to even consider it.
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:20:22
I respectfully disagree. Of all possible words, bits is a word associated to quantify computer memory and should thus not also used as a unit for payment. Bitcoin as it stands is a new paradigm and is fairly complex to newbies. If we overload a word that is fairly well known we confuse people on a topic that is already very hard to grasp.
Your connection speed is measured in megabits, fees are expressed in Satoshi per byte... imagine someone trying to explain why something costs as much as his broadband connection is fast... and that the fees he has to pay do not depend on the amount of the transaction even if they depend on the bytes of his transaction expressed in bits.
I would rather we use uBTC, Satoshi, Sat or even Coin (let me send you 5 megacoins). Everything but not bits, let’s not needlessly confuse new joiners...
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:39:18

I am curious about your rebuttal of the detailed rationale the core developers gave about this banning of nodes. It made sense to me but apparently you think their reasoning has some flaws?
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:23:16
I am very sorry you somehow feel the need to respond so sternly. It was not my intention to attack you personally but rather to have a civil conversation and exchange of ideas.
I agree with your analysis about the history of the word bit. But don’t you agree that using the same term for different things within the same domain could lead to at least some confusion? I feel that within the digital world the term “bit” is generally accepted to be associated with data.
I also agree that a connection is measured in bits, kilobits, megabits, gigabits ... per second. I may be not be on your par intellectually, but I can assure you that there are people who understand even less about bitcoin then both of us. And they will wonder why their connection is for gigabits/sec but that is in no way related to gigabits in the bitcoin domain.
I also get that you think of fees in EUR, however that implies some exchange rate. In Bitcoin they are expressed as Satoshi per byte. Or, as you would prefer, in bit per byte.
Now I get that you are very smart and are not confused by this. But why would you want to make bitcoin more difficult to understand to those that are not as smart? Believe me, for the common person, bitcoin is a completely new concept and is very difficult to get in its entirety. Why make it more difficult on purpose just because for you it’s obvious?
I am just saying: there are so many alternatives. Out of all of them, why go for bit? I support anything short that is not already overloaded within the digital domain.
@_date: 2017-09-01 04:20:01
It is not nonsense. If you wanted to spam you would just insert transactions that have such a low fee that they will most probably not be included. That bloats the mempool, skews the fee estimation and incentivises costlier transactions. And in case they DO get confirmed, you pay little anyways.
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:06:43
Ah, then I apologise, you meant something else. I was referring to all the transactions that involve a business and which usually rely on terms and conditions. That’s the case with exchanges and any online shop that is a legal entity somewhere.
Say a business sells you 2X coin calling it “Bitcoin” and you only buy it because everybody says “Bitcoin is great”... you may feel scammed as soon as you find out that you can’t send them to your “official Bitcoin” wallet on your computer. You simply didn’t get what you wanted and paid for. Is this a fraud done by the exchange? Can an exchange sell you something and call it something else? Courts will have to establish whether a company can sell something like 2X coins under the name of Bitcoin.
You can’t sell a copper bar calling it gold, but can you sell 2X and call it bicon?
You may not like it, but someone will look at whether the business was acting in or against the best interests of the buyer.
@_date: 2017-10-15 07:59:56
You should. Hodling is one thing, but realise that you give bitcoin value by actually using it whenever you can. The more you use it, the more you will see other companies wanting a piece of the pie as well and starting to accept bitcoin. The more you use it the more people will talk about it.
Ok, sometimes fees may be high but in the end you compensate them by the rising price. If a few weeks ago you created a wallet just for casual expenses and put a small amount in, you would have easily compensated all fees by the rise in value.
Another advantage of using a low security and low value wallet: it acts as a kind of honeypot for potential hackers: the moment you see your low-security wallet is hacked, you can assume your computer / smartphone is infected and you should take precautions.
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:04:24
If there is a litigation the courts will decide. And it’s not sure who will end being considered bitcoin by the courts: the implementation where the most links point to (on google, Wikipedia ecc), the one considered bitcoin by the exchanges... it’s going to get messy, that’s for sure
@_date: 2017-09-06 05:42:03
Who is the core developer that I may contact for arranging such a push back?
Anyhow, I thought you said SegWit2x would be the new reference client, so shouldn’t they show leadership and responsibility by planning for a safe and sensible rollout?
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:50:20
On a philosophical level I would agree that they should not . But in reality they will. They have to establish whether an exchange acted wrongfully or not when delivering 2X coins under the name of “Bitcoin” to a customer expecting “Bitcoin” that would be transferable into the wallet of his official client.
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:31:45
They may have been waiting for a good excuse not to be the first ones to bail. Given however that some major actors are switching, I fully expect them to do so as well.

It is really unfortunate that while trying to be an olive branch it is being executed so badly.
It is rushed and doesn’t even implement safety measures such as replay protection. Bitcoin Core, or any other developer with some grain of common sense, cannot in good faith support a deployment plan that is so unnecessarily risky.
Please note that I am not debating whether 2X is a good idea or not. I don’t get into that debate because the execution of SegWit2X is inherently so risky that we should oppose it no matter how potentially amazing the contents.

I would say that in order to encourage bitcoin payments you would need to just offer a discount on all services paid in bitcoin. That would nudge a few people over, even if the discount is quite small (you could have it as small as the credit card fees you are saving).
As a software I invite you to look at “BTCPay server”. It is free, open source, already supports lightning and is increasingly used. From my understanding it even allows you to have the client pay in BTC but you get USD (should you want that). While it is powerful it may however require some tech skills to set up unfortunately...

Consider that all the other alts have much less hashing power behind them (security), are in many cases way more centralised and have a much much shorter track record. Sure, you can polemically say “much wow”, it doesn’t change the fact that these considerations are very important if you really want to store value safely. I agree that eth may be one of the few valid alternatives according to the criteria I cited above.
@_date: 2018-04-22 05:19:30
It would unfortunately be very simple. They may not block the acquisition of bitcoin but they just need to proclaim that the only legal tender any business can accept would be the dollar or the e-dollar. As a result bitcoin would practically disappear from all POS terminals and US based online stores. Stores would not have their “bitcoin accepted here” stickers anymore.
Sure, there may be some stores still secretly accepting bitcoin (nobody would be really able to
enforce a total ban) but let’s be honest: the average joe living in the US would see no real use in bitcoin anymore.
That said I hope it will never happen. My point however is: don’t downplay the power of the regulator! That’s very dangerous!
@_date: 2018-04-23 03:45:42
So you have heard about it but didn’t try it? It is really quite remarkable, I really wonder how you can say there has not been any progress made. Even Peter Todd apparently went from the critics to the believers yesterday. So you really should try it and you will see how incredible it is.

Think about it in another way: if fees were too low I would start to encode the backups of my computer in transactions and store them on the blockchain. The storage space on the great immutable blockchain is intended for transactions but it would be misused for all kinds of other stuff. We saw that throughout the history of computing: the more space became available, the more it was used. Microsoft Word used to fit on a floppy disk, now it uses hundreds of MB of data.
If blocks were larger, people would find ways to fill them up somehow. Maybe some idiotic exchanges would start adding a scan of your ID attached to every transaction... because that would solve them some AML issues and with large blocks they could (I know it’s stupid... but you never know). I can’t predict how things will evolve, but historically more space always led it to be used up somehow.
Transactions must have a price or we would succumb to spam or huge amounts of data.
@_date: 2017-05-12 04:08:15
This is not a foolproof method, but if for any reason you really must enter a password on a potentially infected computer, activate a screen keyboard. Mix entering the password through physical keys, clicking on the screen keyboard, clicking outside the password field, type a few characters so they are not recorded as your password and so on. It takes much longer to enter a password that way, but at least you avoid the naive keyloggers that just record hardware keys. They would only record a part of the password plus some characters that are not part of it.
That said, a clean system is much safer. But if you must use a contaminated system, this is a countermeasure that may save you.

I don't mean they should lead the movement but at least offer an informed and neutral opinion on potential risks or the lack thereof. They know the protocol best and can at least give some insights. Then anyone can make up his own mind. I am wary of running a software which somebody tells me is fine... but no dev really commented on. I feel there is so much silence about UASF that I don't know what to think. And yes, I am not a bitcoin developer, so I need some expert guidance to properly make up my mind.
@_date: 2017-05-11 13:44:00
Ah, sure, now I understand what you meant. I thought you meant that UASF with 10% of nodes signalling for UASF was enough... my bad 
@_date: 2017-05-22 03:52:11
Well, in theory you could run their code until Segwit is activated, then switch back to the core client...
@_date: 2017-05-16 05:41:08
That is true, my concern however is that UASF cannot gain community support if there are no experienced devs either contributing or at least giving their blessing.
Without some official binaries and some degree of testing/analysis I myself am wary of running UASF's. I know I can get UASF for bip 148 running on my node somehow... but unless there is some simple and trusted binary there to download I am too afraid to install it. I know, that's lazy, complacent... but I'm sure I'm not the only one thinking like this.
@_date: 2017-05-14 09:41:33
Could we somehow set up a way to donate bitcoins to all the pools that signalled for Segwit during a certain period? For instance we donate now to an address whose contents are distributed in 6 months to all the pools that are signalling Segwit for one month on a row?
Ok, that's probably a crazy though... but as we are talking about digital money I reckon it should be possible to set up some kind of incentive scheme based on donations...

That’s important. As a naive user I don’t want to know my balance in lightning or in on-chain. I want one balance and ideally I will not even know that there is something called “lightning”. I just transfer coins and... sometimes it’s quicker and sometimes it takes 10-20 minutes. But it works.
I also would hide the information about “channels”. No grandma will want to know what that is. It’s just confusing. You may have an advanced view with all kinds of geeky info but what the masses ultimately need is a wallet with a balance and a big transfer button. What happens behind the scenes should be hidden. That’s my idea on how to accelerate adoption.
I applaud you for your allowance approach. That’s nice and “grandma” compatible!
@_date: 2017-06-06 09:18:52
It doesn't depend on your phrase. The problem is that you are taking the topmost word for each letter. That means that you will NEVER have any seed with the word "tourist". You are basically excluding all words that are in position &gt; 25 for each letter. That's a lot. Plus you know that if you can't have the word "tackle" without also having the word "table". Basically these small rules exclude an incredible amount of combinations.
I "think" you are reducing the keyspace from 25^2048 to 25^26
That's still a lot but it's WAY less!
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:54:16
The way I see it, you reduce the search space significantly. For each character you start from the top and will thus never use the last characters in the alphabet. It is highly probable that there is "table" in your seed while "thunder" can't be in there, even if your magic phrase is 25 times t.
That helps an attacker a lot! Now I'm not a mathematician but I have got the feeling that your method reduces the search space too much...

How many words could your seed start with? One of the 26 words that are on top of the alphabet. Not 2048 that are in the whole list, but the first word has to be one of 26. It can't be "tourist", that's impossible. But it could be "table".
Now the second word. From how many do you chose the second word? Again, 26 and not 2048.

Well, an attacker might be writing a code right now to get your funds. I know I could. So anyone using this method of hiding the seed now or in the future could be vulnerable. I agree though that you could change the algorithm... but once you reveal it, someone somewhere may start coding.
Keep in mind that the seed is not tied to your physical device. Once someone has the seed, he can get to your funds, even if he sits on the other side of the world.
Don't get me wrong, I like the gist of the idea but I am just trying to protect you.

That's great, but what happens in the case of a re-org? If the core chain is longer at the beginning but then gets overtaken by the UASF chain, all my transactions on done on breadwallet would disappear? That's kinda scary...
