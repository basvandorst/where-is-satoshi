Hi Chooseaname111, I'm Venezuelan, and no not really. $4 is just enough to buy 1 kilo of meat in the cheapest market. The thing is that most Venezuelans don't get paid $4 as no one would be able to survive with that, so companies are starting to pay them more now that dollars are legal. It's still not enough to get by in most cases, so a lot of people get help from their family abroad, others have multiple jobs. Some others (like me) get by working online. Food became really expensive, so now a small family budget for only food will usually be over $200/month. The budget becomes more expensive as you add basic necessities such as toiletries and medicines.   
As of your other questions.
\&gt; Also what is the situation at restaurants, how much would a dish cost? 
 I can't afford going to restaurants but from what I've heard there are normal restaurants where prices are $10-$20 or so, while there are very luxurious restaurants that are frequented by government officials and the people who work with them, as well as rich people with companies I suppose.   
\&gt; Are there many travellers there right now? I imagine not many but for the ones that are there they must be able to buy so much for so little ?!   
Not many travelers I suppose, Venezuela is known for having a high crime rate so most foreigners won't want to come here (even tho crime has decreased a bit). And I think they they would buy more in Colombia or Brazil than they'd do here. In the past things used to be very cheap here but not anymore. Now we have international prices on everything except for services (that are still cheap).  
If you have more questions feel free to ask.

Hi, not OP but also Venezuelan. Yes, there is power but it goes out every now and then, especially when it rains or when there are protests. Some places have been without power for months.
