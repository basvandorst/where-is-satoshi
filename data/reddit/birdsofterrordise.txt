I'm a teacher and have been around a lot of teachers.
0% is literally reserved for two things: cheating and outright not doing it. Ethically, you can't give a kid a zero if work is there and this isn't an exacting skill like science or math. Also he would likely get points or a rubric grade- especially at 5th grade. Furthermore, the size of the kid's letters is very close to the teacher's. You can try slanting and writing "bad" but this is pitiful. 
But the biggest ringer why this is a fake assignment is the ponzi line. That is not in the curriculum, not even in high school economics, let alone 5th grade. Hell most Americans would have no idea what that is and you expect me to buy that a 5th grader would have to write an essay on it as punishment. Get real. s/he would likely just suggest other topics they felt were appropriate, not something like this. Hope you enjoy these people's money.

It's seriously so cultish- once you understand The Word^TM, man, *you'll totally get it!* and if you don't damnation/hell/insert flavor of choice here.

Again, you clearly do not understand what accountants do. Come back when you can use something other than buzzwords like "disruption" and you stop conflating auditors with accountants. You clearly have a chip on your shoulder about the pay they receive , but that would make sense as you don't understand what it is they actually do.

You're right, it is more of a collective delusion.

I sub for all grades, 5th and 6th my favorites and I can straight up tell you that this is bullshit. The literally bad teachers would probably write 10/10 and hand it back. In our elem ed classes it is standard practice that 0 is only for cheating and at out refusal for assignments (lates are always tolerable provided they get in before the grading period ends.) I sub in over a dozen districts and been to many more. I've been working with that age group for almost 8 years and I can definitely say this whole thing smells like bullshit. Congrats, he got a bunch of people to eat it up.

But does the value of your bitcoin you accepted drop more than 3% in a day? 
@_date: 2014-04-07 11:52:02
So it isn't supposed to be a currency? Oh okay, not yet a currency.  Well then what in the hell is it supposed to be used for? The rationalization is impressive in this one.

No one here talks about the ridiculous energy bills these people rack up from mining either. Not only is it thousands and thousands of dollars for equipment, but the usage is frankly absurd and for what?

Please tell me more about the international wire transfers you are conducting? Money to Nigerian princes?

Because I'm the government "out to get you".  No, I think you're making a stupid decision and businesses need stability to thrive. Cue in a year or two when bitcoin is worth nothing or fail to use it for legit purposes and you're on here asking for handouts because the price has gotten so low that you're in need of help because it pegged your life to imaginary money.

FUD? Can't be bothered to write it out?  I don't need to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt, when it is painfully obvious what is going on. You can choose to cover your ears and go lalalalalala or you can wake up and show some skepticism.

Then we raise taxes to get into the city, raise the cost of parking, and make public transit more attractive.
@_date: 2014-04-07 11:55:54
So why do you think this is possibly okay for a currency? You realize that people need to pay bills or life necessities NOW, not later when the price increases. That's why deflationary currency is such a load of shit. You think a business can wait a month for the currency to increase to pay their suppliers? Hell no.

Oh boy, I am sure you do. You can make up a bullshit meeting  and get more karma. And buddy you don't ask for coins here because that would be called begging and it is not allowed so any clever way to get tips. And it was clever- people tripping over themselves to tip you and "stick it to education" without any sort of half critical thought. Sorry, still bullshit.

I actually just shared this with some teachers in the lounge. They were really confused as to what teacher has time for a 3 line justification (Incomplete! Unacceptable! Ponzi scheme!) much less the exclamation points.  He could be using his own notebook that could be college ruled, but one teacher was like, why isn't a 5th grader using wide ruled paper? Also, not a single teacher said they would mark this zero, even if he was wildly off topic and wrote about lemurs playing in daffodils for five pages, he would still get partial credit.

You really should. Get out while you can, salvage what you can, and maybe all the life vests haven't been taken yet.

Any mental gymnastics to get yourself to sleep at night, buddy.

UM being FDIC insured is kind of a big deal.
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:52:32
LOL. OK. In just a single day, the price can vary over $100 per coin (do you even realize how insane that is?) And at one point last year it was over $1000 per coin. Recently it was $200-300--doesn't sound much like double-plus does it? Unless this is 1984 and that is what you consider "double plus good".

The bitcoin community is so afraid of skepticism, it is increasingly unable to be self-aware and challenge itself. Then again, maybe it never was able to be or to do either of those things.
@_date: 2014-12-05 21:24:17
Truly, most teachers don't even want to deal with the pitfalls of giving zeros if there is some work present, that's what makes this questionable. And it isn't like the assignment was turned in late--there are no LATES written on it, just "supposedly" someone with something against bitcoin? Ok. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:11:23
Are you comically bad at ordering things on websites? Also, your story sounds so goddamn fake. I can't believe anyone would honestly take you seriously.
@_date: 2014-04-07 11:50:20
You're right, it needs a spectacular finish.
@_date: 2014-04-07 11:48:54
But then you missed the "point" of using bitcoin in the first place. Bitcoin can't do that, thus really can't survive.
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:59:58
Do you even know what an accountant actually does?
