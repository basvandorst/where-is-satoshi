there is absolutely no reason for me to need bitcoin.  there is no bitcoin market in my area, and talks about cryptocurrency usually ends with the company proposing its own currency.  i see countless investors praising bitcoin, and i can only imagine its because they put a lot of money into something that can be duplicated by literally anyone at any time.  certainly with enough money, joe investment could persuade his invested companies to adopt bitcoin transactions, establishing local markets to introduce bitcoin and get people comfortable using it.  i think more realistically companies will prefer their own coin, where they can control the price and transaction validations.  im not saying bitcoin will go away, or lose value; i just dont think its the end all be all they praise it to be.  also i couldnt imagine driving to the store with the last of my bitcoin hoping i have enough when i get there for a soda, holding up the cashier waiting for a spike.

yes, idk why you are confused, that is correct.  total investment/ total bitcoins = average exchange rate

“As I have explained previously, Bitcoin is not money. Bitcoin is a protocol. If you treat it in this way, with the correct assumptions, you can start the process of putting Bitcoin in a proper context, allowing you to make rational suggestions about the sort of services that might be profitable based on it.”
this is the best part.

well you spent $30 for how many bitcoin?

a crypto-shop, lemme know how that works out.  youd prolly do better mining and reserving your own bitcoin, as the exchange is fairly simple (and the atms scalp like 10%+), and could following the same 2:FA as the atms.

its interesting that big banks are pushing for stronger cryptomarkets.  i feel if digital market currencies were to be established, markets would prefer more stable digital coins if not their own.  “this product cost 14 tokens which equals $14USD, sorry we dont accept cash for products but we sell tokens.”  sounds silly. 
i just dont see why a business would opt for transparency.  once their wallet is identified, all their transactions are public.  am i wrong?
what i can see are corporations establishing private ledger coins for tracking purchases and expenses within the companies.  perhaps offering services for these coins as a means to outsource labor.
