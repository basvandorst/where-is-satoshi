well, one has to distinguish between the fundamental benefit of providing public funding to companies (without such funding, ventures might not be pursued, products not built -&gt; less economic activity) and the rampant manipulation/distortion on top of it (induced by money printing -&gt; skews economic incentives for companies)
what I'm saying is that there are legit and (mutually) beneficial reasons for lending/loaning...even if not used for capitalisation but because of an individual's

except they aren't... even a crypto-currency that is an identical copy of bitcoin is inferior in terms of actual use because of
* less hashing power, ergo less security and higher risk of double spend attacks
* less infrastructure and adoption, ergo less real-world utility
I agree about the marketing thing and I like doge as an entry mechanism into cryptocurrency: it has a lighthearted and playful nature precisely because it has low value/actual utility, noone wants to experiment with "real" money;
one symptom: while bitcoin transactions currently impose 8 cent fees, doge doesn't
unfortunately that also means that while doge can teach people about the transactional utility of cryptocurrencies, it's low value will keep them from learning about the essential security aspect (why bother if it's close to free)

the term "cryptocurrency" refers to digital, p2p (i.e. decentralized) currencies, therefore the assertion that cryptocurrencies have been around before, is simply false; virtual currencies on the other hand have been around for quite a while and it would indeed be odd to be excited about them

"This will come as somewhat a disappointment to many of you, but I believe it is necessary if we are to be secure from the start. We are currently considering adding hours to the launch time to allow us to continue fixing bugs and patching security holes that have been uncovered. In addition, it is likely we will disable the bitcoin process on launch until we can gauge the traffic more accurately - this is to protect your bitcoins as high traffic sites and bitcoin processes do not work well over Tor.
I will try to keep you updated, but launch time will probably not be 4:20PM UTC I am afraid."

"The hype surrounding Bitcoin has escalated in recent months and its market value has rocketed; the price of a single Bitcoin hit a new peak of $1,242 on Friday on the Mt Gox exchange, established in Tokyo in 2009 as a trading card exchange.
Critics warn of a speculative bubble although its proponents believe that the currency could be widely adopted as a method of making payments outside the traditional banking system. Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and other government officials around the world have said virtual currencies could have benefits if they can be regulated to prevent money laundering.
Increased trading in the decentralised virtual currency has begun to attract the attention of regulators
Holders of the Alderney Bitcoin would not be able to spend it in stores but would be able to exchange it for a virtual Bitcoin by travelling to the island.
Alderney hopes that by minting the first physical Bitcoin it will raise its profile as the “go-to” destination for the virtual currency, as it seeks to expand its offshore credentials beyond the online gambling sector.
David Janczewski, head of new business at the Royal Mint confirmed it had been approached by the finance minister of Alderney to “explore the possibility of manufacturing a physical commemorative coin with a Bitcoin theme”.
“Discussions have not progressed further and at this stage it remains nothing more than a concept,” he added.
But the controversy around Bitcoin has made the Alderney plan a sensitive subject. The Treasury, which owns the Royal Mint, declined to comment on the plans. George Osborne, the British chancellor, also holds the title of Master of the Mint.
The plans have been steered by chairman of the island’s finance committee, and are understood to have the support of Alderney’s president, although they still need to be approved by the island’s 10-member parliament.
A number of private companies have produced physical Bitcoins, although they are not backed by an official mint. Instead they feature a holographic strip, which is peeled off to reveal the private key then redeemed online.
How would Alderney’s plan work?
An independent company will provide the Bitcoins. If the price plunged, neither Alderney nor the Royal Mint would lose anything.
The company would put the Bitcoins in an escrow account at an agreed price.
Meanwhile, the Royal Mint would take customers’ orders for its minted Bitcoins and receive money from those coin sales.
The virtual Bitcoins backing the physical coins would be held in digital storage facilities by Alderney.
The Mint would issue the commemorative Bitcoin, paying for the value of the gold content itself. Alderney would receive royalties from sales of the coins.
Coins could be redeemed for sterling at any point in Alderney for the price of a Bitcoin on that day."

No, the fees are actually likely to get higher with the implementation of floating fees in 0.9.
Quote Gavin:
 "With the state of the network today, that would result in Bitcoin-Qt suggesting that the user give a typical 257-byte transaction a fee of between 0.0001 and 0.001 BTC"
 that´s 6.5cents to 65cents

whole article:
"Silicon Valley is starting to catch Bitcoin fever – though the entrepreneurs and venture capitalists being drawn to the virtual currency claim that the biggest profits will come from using it to build a new digital finance industry rather than just as a vehicle for speculation.
Digital currency companies that have attracted early rounds of venture capital in recent weeks include Circle Internet Financial, headed by Jeremy Allaire, a serial entrepreneur from the media technology industry, and Ripple Labs, whose founder, Chris Larsen, was behind pioneering peer-to-peer lending company Prosper.
Prominent investors who have been drawn to the field include Jim Breyer, a partner at Accel and early backer of Facebook, as well as Google’s venture capital arm, which has invested in Ripple and Buttercoin, a Bitcoin exchange.
Bitcoin’s tech industry backers argue that the shared protocols and common technology standards on which it is based echo the open technologies that lie at the heart of the internet. That could make it the foundation for a low-cost, standards-based financial system independent of the traditional banking industry.
“It reminds me of the internet protocols in the mid-1990s,” said Jim Breyer, who is also a director of retailer Walmart. Bitcoin was an “enormous ecommerce opportunity” for merchants, because it could greatly reduce transactions costs and make it easier to buy online, said Mr Breyer, who contributed to a $9m investment in Circle – the biggest first-round financing for a payments start-up, according to the company.
“It’s sort of like we’re in 1996,” said Mr Larsen. That could make possible the same sort of disruption in finance that the media and communications worlds faced with the rise of the internet. While riding the Bitcoin wave, his company has also created its own virtual currency, Ripples.
An open digital currency platform made it possible for start-ups to create a wide range of financial applications, similar to the way companies such as Google broke into the media world by building on the internet’s HTTP protocol, Mr Larsen said.
However, Silicon Valley faces a number of hurdles if it wants to take a lead in the creation of a virtual financial system. Regulators in the US have been more cautious than in other countries, making banks nervous about setting up accounts for Bitcoin companies and putting a chill over investment in the new field.
Brazil, Germany and Russia had taken a more open stance, contributing to a wave of Bitcoin exchanges and other virtual currency start-ups in those countries, said Micky Malka of Ribbit Capital, a Silicon Valley investor in financial services. China has become the focal point for much of the innovation, according to venture capitalists, given the speculative investment frenzy there and lower penetration of traditional financial services.
Silicon Valley’s Bitcoin start-ups claim that comments by regulators at a Senate hearing two weeks ago show that US attitudes are changing. In written testimony, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said virtual currencies held “long-term promise” for innovation in finance, though they also raised the risk of money-laundering and other crimes.
Fans say Bitcoin’s open protocols make it possible for payments to flow as freely and cheaply as email, leading to a race to build low-cost payment systems founded on the virtual currency. Entrepreneurs such as Mr Allaire at Circle say this gives merchants a strong incentive to adopt the currency, in that they would escape charges from payment card companies. “There’s an enormous 3 per cent tax on a large share of the world’s payments,” he said.
For consumers, using currencies like Bitcoin could present a way round fees and foreign exchange costs, which consume up to 10 per cent of international remittances, said Mr Larsen.
Meanwhile, the huge volatility in the Bitcoin price, which soared above $1,000 last week, has created a headache for start-ups that hope it will come to be seen as a stable and widely accepted medium of exchange rather than a speculative commodity.
“The bubble craziness of the currency was not a positive for me in any way,” said Mr Breyer at Accel.
The tech start-ups claim they will be able to sidestep into other virtual currencies should faith in Bitcoin evaporate. Some, like Ripple, have invented their own."
