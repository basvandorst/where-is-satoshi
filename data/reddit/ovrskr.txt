The difference is that Europeans (especially in the East) have live through all that shit and know why the freedom to use Bitcoin should be defended. There's still communists in France and Germany and such, but yea.
In the USA it's all about regulating everything down and sending people to jail for mishandling obscure clauses of the law (which in the case of cryptocurrencies is *not even codified*). Once it is, you can bet there will be a few very public cases with obscene long sentences to "send a message".

What are your metrics then? The housing bubble here hasn't popped up yet, unemployment is at euro-levels in the East of the country, and household debt is higher than it has ever been in the states.
Sure there's growth, but it's all debt really, to a degree that surpasses every other country out there even.

They sure have the "right", in the sense that repercussions for looting will be few, but you have to put money where your mouth is. Capitalism's tenets lies in cooperation, and win-win exchanges. If you're to bring up capitalism, then the act of grabbing everything without holding your end of the deal (the deal is clearly stated, if you think the content benefited you, donate accordingly), well that just doesn't hold up to any sort of standard.

meh, I don't live in that country, so I could care less. I would say that it seems to fit though, they could keep the coins for arbitrary reasons. it's easy to conceive of a way coins could be illegally used, so the state could make up a bullshit reason like that and keep them
@_date: 2014-12-03 13:27:30
of course not, there's ample empirical evidence that this state does not follow its own laws, and abuses people with civil forfeiture daily.

they would back your investment for a given percentage.
that way you get safety, and you don't violate the non-aggression principle (ie, libertarian-friendly in the Bitcoin spirit, unlike regulation at a fiat level).
@_date: 2014-11-20 16:35:17
It's a bit sad. alts are a wild ride, and part of the reason might be that the bitcoin core devs strongly discourage smart folks to try and make the situation a bit better

The guy is struck in his own Western bubble. Look around the world and see how the alternatives are doing. THIS is what Bitcoin is about right now, not buying a futon on Overstock.com.
This is also why I think his analysis is misguided. The libertarians have the moral upper ground; the 'well balanced' people he talks about are those willing to close their eyes on the fact that they hold the world reserve's currency and still have the gov to back their asses.. or so they think
@_date: 2014-07-07 07:55:55

Technically the coins aren't lost, it's just that silly humans misplace the keys. There is one exception to that, burn addresses for which we do not know if there exists a corresponding private key.
Fair enough, it will end. We'll be dead then, but maybe someone else will see it.

well, technically so is Bitcoin. Unless you don't agree minting will end somewhere in 2150?
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:44:19
For the foreseeable future, Bitcoin's inflation will be much higher than dogecoin's (mathematically some 10+ years.)
Either way, during most of its life Dogecoin's reward halving algorithm worked much the same as Bitcoin's, albeit with different parameters, and the halving didn't have that much of an effect people hoped it would have, either because it was already factored into the price, or miners' inflation had a bigger impact on deflating the price.
Bitcoin will never be deflationary, because the block reward can never go negative, thus the coin supply cannot go down. The usual keyneysian definition of 'deflation' can be thrown out the window, because Bitcoin is not centrally controlled and it makes no sense to apply the term meaning the result of price rise following government spending (or the converse thereof.)

Because they only consider the financial freedom aspect of it all. Singapore routinely ranks among the worst in terms of press freedom and many things are very strictly controlled, so I'm not sure how that could be. Then again people also think Somalia is ancap paradise, so whatever.

This is false, you need to support all nodes, otherwise your client will fork off from the main Bitcoin network. Either way, with Bitcoin, it is not obvious what the protocol is, it is a though problem. If you don't believe me, look at the history of btcd, they already forked the network a number of times.
So it's not exactly _majority_ like a democracy, bitcoin is a network of _concensus_, if you don't agree with the network, you're out. It's unfortunate that the implementation is ill defined, but there you go, no point going about reimplementing it in Go...
@_date: 2016-05-22 02:18:07
The USA certainly can (weak TLS).
Anyway there's no crypto involved with the basic bitcoin stuff, only with encrypting the wallet. The rest is all hash functions and network code pretty much

I want to agree with you, but it is not obvious to me that the various undefined behaviours of C (not to mention C++ is _not_ context-free) always map to the same precise turing machine grammar (or at least equivalent ones).
Of course that was a long time ago, for sure now the codebase has been combed over a billion times, but the point still stands because legacy.
Either way, I am humbled to see nullc replied :-)
@_date: 2015-03-24 04:04:58
Of course it is permissible, the compiler certainly doesn't care to stop you, it is simply.. undefined. The fact that we have -Werror is tangential to this, though certainly nice for people using GCC, which did not comprise Satoshi, at least initially.
I think we may be splitting hair, since I know for a fact there's no way a compiler from Microsoft from 1998 (VC++6.0 afaik?) conforms to any kind of standard acceptably anyway =P.
