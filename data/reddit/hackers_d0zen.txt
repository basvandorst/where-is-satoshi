I don’t think that’s how it works.  Fiat literally means ‘by decree’, so fiat currency exists as currency only ‘by decree’.  Bitcoin exists as currency outside of any official decree, and independent of national adoption.

I guarantee there are two crypto transactions you can make today that will double your money, and if you know what they are you aren’t telling anyone else.  Nobody knows the future.

I have no idea, just that this link was posted somewhere on Reddit earlier, and they did a great job of using Medium's "unpublished article" feature.

I agree with you.  Traditional investment takes a lot of time to move assets, deal with brokers and middle men, regulation, settlement, etc.
Crypto is the traditional investment model in 32x fast forward.  We have had plenty of time to consolidate, in the new paradigm.

You want a system where math works differently based on the net worth of individuals?  
Sounds dystopian and horrible to me.

You are right, but this would collapse the many bubbles going on right now, since credit would be way more expensive.  This would crash the global economy.  
While in theory this would mean BTC would have its moment to shine, what would most likely happen is a quick moon (&gt;$10M), then governments say the crash is the fault of BTC, and start seizing hardware (and people....).
I think central banks maintaining a loose monetary policy with a slow climb for BTC, both in value and mind share, is the best route.

Ok, but here's the thing: the wheel is a universally useful object, whereas block chain is pretty specifically​ useful to crypto currency.  Where other application would I need to combine massive 1:1 duplication, digital signing, distributed hashing, and a public ledger?  Any other use I've seen proposed would work just as well without one or more of those features.
I'm seriously asking, as I'm confused when people say that blockchain is some huge technical leap forward.

What you just described is perfectly fair.  The rich can make the market jump using their money, and the poor cannot.
This is a fair system.

For most people, the internet is a waste of time.  
Take email for example: it takes less than 30 seconds to drop a letter in the mailbox, the government runs a mandatory delivery service, everyone has the ability to get a letter delivered.  I can find anyone’s address in the YellowPages; I have no idea where to find everyone’s email address.  I can even send packages!  Try that with email.
Music, for another supposed ‘use case’ of the internet.  Installing a sound card for your computer is time consuming and expensive and besides, 9600 baud is far too slow to transfer good quality music anyway!  In the time it takes to boot my computer I can be two songs deep into my favorite vinyl.  Also, how many songs can even fit on a hard drive anyway?  Even low quality mp3 files take up two megabytes, so about 100 or so?  I have more than that on my bottom shelf in my library on 8 track.
And so on ....

Who values the collateral?  What happens if the collateral value drops before the loan is repaid?  What happens if the value of the collateral drops and the loan is not repaid?
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:29:40
The banks are holding the mortgage backed collateral and the T-Bills.  I agree that the T-Bills won’t drop instantly (though the likelihood that they will goes up with these kinds of issues) but the mortgage-backed securities are exactly the asset that went to zero almost instantly back in 2008.  The banks most certainly do NOT control the value of the MBS.

Who values the assets that backs those repo deals?  What if their value suddenly drops?
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:54:51
I guess that is where I disagree.  You are right that the banks can’t be blindsided, but not because the value is stable or even realistic.
No one participates in a loan if it is not in their interest to do so. 
They are holding the financial system hostage here the same way they did the rating agencies.  
What happens if the Fed does not make the loans?  Is the Fed really in a position to say ‘no’?
The banks have left the ratings agencies in the dust, they no longer matter when it comes to valuation.  The Fed loan itself validates the valuation of the MBS, and any other asset the banks want to appreciate in value.
It’s also in the interest of the Fed for the ‘market’ to value MBS higher, since the Fed itself holds about [1.4B in MBS](  Not a lot, but they certainly benefit from higher valuations in the same asset class.
So when the music stops and the real value of an MBS is discovered, it won’t be over the course of months, though unraveling CDOs and invalidating ratings.  Something will break somewhere (LIBOR, energy, water, etc.), and the collateral will be valued correctly by circumstance.  
When that happens, the dog will wag the tail, and the illusion will break almost immediately.

The most frightening statement the Fed can make is that action is being taken is due to current market conditions being “against Fed policy”.
They amount of assumptions that have to be made for this statement to be true are mind-boggling:
-  The Fed’s current policy and actions have been insufficient to prevent the condition up to this point 
- The Fed believes that immediate action can prevent the condition that could not be prevented by previous actions
- The Fed believes the immediate action will not make the condition worse
I won’t link to a list of recent immediate actions by the Fed, you get the idea.
You are right to be concerned.
Edit:  I believe that is a straight-up smokescreen so that people will make this specific talking point.  At that level, does the statement really make sense?  It is binary, either they prevent the condition or they do not.

Thanks for responding as an expert in the field.
What happens if a 2008 scenario occurs and the mortgage bonds become worthless very quickly?
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:14:06
No, the collateral is held by the banks that are short cash and need the loan.
