Yep. Then I will cash out wait for retreacement get back in the rocketship and go to 50k
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:57:32
Prior starting going down I move my money to tether and I set 3 buying orders. 50% 10600 30% 9600 and 20% 8700
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:53:42
So close to my first buy in :)
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:07:05
Me too. Maybe a little under 8 but it won't stop until 25 to 30k after
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:08:33
I dont. Charts don't care about FUD or bias. I'm all for Bitcoin but it has to go lower before it goes to the moon
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:18:46
Nice dude Good for you. I been buying altcoins like there is no tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:08:35
I am not dude. Check the charts and technical analysis. This is momenteraly only.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:13:09
I got out at 14k and was telling some people here that it was expected to go at least to 8.5k but they made fun of me.... Now I'm just parked in tether
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:17:54
We will. Get some buy orders around 8700
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:09:34
This how a healthy market should look like. Retreacement, consolidation and to the moon
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:05:54
Don't listen to the FUD. It should go down to 8ish or a bit less and then back up. Believe it or not this retracement is healthy. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:52:59
It will go up! if you are trap at the top just hodl. You don't want to lose your position.( Just my opinion not a financial advice)
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:34:17
Remember dude hodl. It will come back up eventually
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:49:26
If you check right now, the BTC is in a big bearish trend. 8700 is my basement. that why I have entries at 10600 and 9600. Not trying to FUD, bitcoin is going to go back up and possible pass the all time high. Once bitcoin hits 12600 (panic zone) weak hands will start to massive sell. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:29:22
I disagree 
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:16:28
Good for you. I will be expecting a message from you soon :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:44:28
Thanks for the info, please keep me posted
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:23:51
this is not the bottom
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:16:13
Totally agree with you. It should go down to at least 8700ish might be a bit Dipper, but once the bottom has been reached it will go up really quick
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:54:43
It will at least hit 10600
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:01:22
Next it will hit 9800
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:12:28
Charts, technical analysis, historical data... You don't have to do it but this are my entry points 
BUY1: 10600
BUY2: 9800
BUY3: 8600 
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:47:47
Check the charts, if it hits 12600 is going down fast from there
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:26:44
I know! I have been warning people. If they want to hodl that is fine the price will go back up. But a lot of shaky hands will sell and lose a ton of money once it goes down more
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:27:22
It should go down to 9ish or 8ish before it goes back up. This retracement is actually healthy for the coin growth
