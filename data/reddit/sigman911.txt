When I was starting out of course you get scammed. You have to learn. Ask questions on the forums. The pro trader's will help you. If you have any questions feel free to ask me. You can always just goto sell bitcoin section and sell whichever method you feel is good for you.

paypal hates bitcoin.. So they wouldn't take your side on that matter. For now on don't send the BTC over a blockchain, send it via paper wallet with keys written down so you have proof that you sent the payment to the address. Also keep all transcript's.

I would check state laws before I decided to sell/ship to anyone to make sure its legal.

lol thats like 25lb's... i guess they like a workout. These are poly plates so they are a lot lighter than the steel one's. They also come with plates for side's of the body as well.

damn!! I was too late :(

I disagree. I think like any other currency market has its ups and downs but it hit the high early due to Mt.Gox but with ALL the new publicity and big investors and small investors it is gaining traction. With that said, like the stock market it tends to take time to build up higher.

its not stolen nor military issued. It meets military specifications.
@_date: 2016-09-22 00:10:30
if its legal to own just about anywhere how would it bring trouble? It can be used for anything. I know people who go jogging with it on so it'll be a better work out.

I'd say always have a paper/offline wallet to store anything you can't recoup from if stolen.. IMO I keep only maybe 1btc or so online an everything else is offline safely stored.

if you sold bitcoins using paypal and didn't have any real in hand proof like a tracking # where you mail them the keys or something.. your screwed. take it as lesson learned and bite the bullet and don't do it again over paypal.

I'm a floridian and guns&amp;drugs are a very common thing here. Especially guns.
@_date: 2016-09-21 20:14:38

Lol definitely not a game type of body armor, real deal mil-spec armor.
@_date: 2016-09-21 22:58:44
i doubt it would be any good in airsoft, these are meant to block real firearm rounds.
@_date: 2016-09-22 19:53:44
check the legislature because its not. Also google body armor for sale. Its ALL over the web for sale legally my friend, you are uninformed.
@_date: 2016-09-19 23:47:16
learn how to short sell and re-buy. Best thing to do with your investment. Learn how to read the chart's but even then overall its just a guesstimate.

Why not? It will attract bitcoin user's and also introduce people to the currency. Good for all.
@_date: 2016-09-18 23:42:44
yes depending on how your buying the BTC. There's a lot of scams that happen on LBC especially cash deposit's or if you don't have any feedback or trade history.
