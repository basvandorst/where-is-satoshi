Welcome. So, how much did you buy? 
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:22:41
Well, I bought my bitcoin at 1400 usd so this doesn't really add up 
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:11:05
Joke. But looking good though, smashing through 9000 mark.

Man, daytrading is so stressful. Always been a big hodler. But I sold at 7800 usd, thinking it would go further down to support at 7200. Of course it immediately went back up 400 usd, spiking my cortisol as a result. Let's see what happens now..

Thanks for the kind words &lt;3 Please do eleborate. I'm all ears for constructive criticism. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:38:01
Those are some positive words. Thanks :)

Yea, I'm certainly itching, that you got right 
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:21:27
Yeah, better not. Because if it's a substantial amount I will have to activate my hackskillz.

Break through the resistance please

LOL. Exactly what I'm holding in the back of my mind as a thing to watch out for. I've been keeping an eye on tradingview ideas and I still believe it will drop below my sell-off point. Though, I'm still scared. This is like the 3rd or 4th time I had to tell myself like 'Wtf are you doing!?'. I also had a big meeting for a new job and going into the appointment all I could think of was: 'You stupid retard, you f*cked up ur bitcoin'

I see!

How does Ledger decide what happens? When using a ledger, don't you control your own private keys? 
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:17:38
Wonder what happens if you cash out. Weird bug. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 20:31:11
Seems to be a display bug. Cashing out 1 bitcoin won't award you with 200k on your bank account

Coinbase has a FAQ about this
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:27:46
Yes. From coinbase to GDAX and vice versa. But that's it.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought SegWit2x wasn't the right way to go? I mean, it does give us SegWit, but is it the preferable way to go?
