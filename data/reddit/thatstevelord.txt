Because the people in charge control the system, the media and almost all sources of information that influence people. Every now and again corruption appears that annoy people, but ultimately they're led to believe that they're individually powerless and are kept divided by false choices, distractions and propaganda to ensure that they remain powerless. They're also so entrenched within the system that some of them will fight to maintain the status quo, even though the system itself deliberately pits them against each other.

I wasn't aware this was a big thing. I buy large lumps of bitcoin on a fairly irregular basis to pay for various projects. I'm not doing anything dodgy or anything, just supporting the currency. Should I stop, or maybe buy in smaller amounts more regularly?
