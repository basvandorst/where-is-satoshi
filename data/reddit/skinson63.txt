Wrong, Pb is the symbol for Lead. It comes from the french "PlomB", which obviously means lead :)

And has one of your past trades ever opened a position?

ok i think i isolated the bug, it comes from the fact that you dont have a deposit address for dogecoin or for bitcoin. There's a problem in the Json parser that throws exception when there is no adress. Can you try to create at least one address for Btc and one for Xdg while i m fixing the code?
[edit] i have fixed the bug and am uploading to Playstore atm. Sorry for inconveniance 
And to answer your question, bug reports are monthly :/

mmh. That's strange. When you say after logging in you mean during profile creation or during app launch?

Dang, i must have another bug hidden in the parser. I ve been through it looking for bugs, but since everything runs fine with my account i have trouble finding where the problem lays. Do you have many different open orders at the same time?

Oh i might have an idea on why it crashes, i d say it s either because your Kraken account isn't tier one verified, or you didnt give the api key the needed authorizations ( which are all but the withdrawal one ). And for the balance, they are defaulted to 0 but updated as soon as the Kraken server answers.

Deposit funds authorization is needed because when you long click your balance, it gives you your deposit address for quick copy paste and ledger entries gives the history of the account. Maan i wish i could see the stacktrace of your phone when the app crashes :/
Does the app write something before it crashes? like a Toast message?

Okay I found another "bug" in the parser, I hadn't seen that when some of your past trades had opened a position, the Kraken API sent more infos than regular trades, which crashed the app.  
I know i'm being demanding but would you be kind enough to update the app once it's available on the Playstore? It takes them about 3-4 hours
It's not much, but I ll be glad to offer you my help for anything i can help with :)
