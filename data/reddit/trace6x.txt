So say Bitcoin becomes 'banned'  but that's OK because plenty of illegal things are banned but still happen. Is that really much of an argument if bitcoin is limited to places like the dark web? Like I don't see myself buying petrol or groceries with bitcoin from major companies if it's been outlawed.

Definitely hurt emotionally, I'm interested in the long term aspects of bitcoin but I'm also interested in day trading.
