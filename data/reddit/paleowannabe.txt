I just wonder how difficult would it be to bind bitcoin and BitTorrent together for a joint payable digital distribution platform?  Something like... I don't know - distributed hash that makes sense and points to downloadable content only after validating it with transaction hash... I don't know,  I'm babbling

Well, I read an article yrsterday that a private held hospital (a freaking hospital!) will start accepting bitcoins soon, with main goal od easing payments for outlanders...

Or some other 2 factor auth, like Google authenticator - this can be installed in a number of places, just in case you don't own a yubikey (I should get one, though...)

No, they'd just have to be honest about their marketing. If they said "hey, we have this business idea that may or may not work, and we'd like to invite you to participate in the risk but perhaps get some rewards sometime in the future" - it's totally different than saying "throw money at us and get a functioning product". It's different risk profile. The product for initial sale would be partnership (which can be delivered as a contract), and after a product had been created - they can sell it using escrow, and use capital gains to reward early investors according to contract.

Here's a rough idea: a webservice, basically like the pirate bay, where the artist (ANY artist, in fact any digital goods provider) can upload his stuff and set a price payable in BTC. Once the visitor comes, he can have a limited preview of the material (to see that it's legit - although there should of course be some verification on the business side), and then they can pay the price and access the torrent. Moreover - the transaction is stored in Bitcoin network, which means that whenever they feel like downloading the files again - anywhere they wish - they can simply pop in the address from which they made a payment (it can be transferred to them as a receipt via email), and boom - they can download the torrent again.

Heh, then maybe (just maybe) the production means would get shifted back from unnecessary crap that everyone buys because their neighbours have it too, to necessities. 
Yes, I understand that majority of goods cannot be produced individually right now (think: high-end electronics), but it might boost specialization and openness (It might not be feasible for me to produce a whole iPhone, but maybe I could be producing some pretty damn good phone screens - but then I better make sure it can fit as many existing and future platforms as possible, so that many customers can purchase it and make me a good ROI on my investment in a factory of screens)

Let me know when you'll be in need of quality assurance - I do it for a living, and I might be able to find some spare time to help you out!

I know this is grim for some people, but technically - if someone has bitcoins, and uhm... dies - doesn't this make the remainder of the system more valuable due to limited supply? 
Then if I'm right, the right strategy is not to kill yourself, but rather wait for others to do it instead, as your savings will then be saved! (but now everyone knows this strategy so we're back at "Spartans, HOOOOOLD").
Which is fine by me.
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:38:54
I never invested in stock previously, only through mutual investment funds, where such strategy was never possible. And it hurt like hell that I hadn't had any cash set aside at my exchange (NOT Mt. Gox) with buy orders at even 50%. But the market fluctuates, and I will definitely set such orders in the future. I probably will have options to automatically buy some at 25% drop, and buy with all I have at -50% - as well as an order to cash out a little at +30-+50%, as I will be needing some hard fiat cash in the future, and I don't see anything wrong with reaping a little profit there.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:38:36
Well, I like it. It actually gives me a little hope to be able to buy some cheap coins on my payday :)

You're how old again? FML, I could'be gotten into mining when I was your age 3 years ago, I too would be a fucking millionaire.
Where were you then, and why didn't you just pat my head with a shovel not to stop?
But seriously - congratulations. Very sincere congratulations. Please don't fuck it all up - I think that if you're willing to buy some luxury items now, it'd be wise of you to see a decent advisor, and just see how you can leverage your cash. And probably diversify, and not cash out all at once. But these are just my thoughts.

Do you think we could actually see cents per BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:16:06
Why now? Why couldn't it have crashed over the weekend, so that I could purchase shitload of coins after my salary on Monday? 
... Or maybe it will hold low price until Monday? Please, bitcoin god, please!

Well, right now (why now, I have no idea) it is on the frontpage of major (probably the biggest) polish newspaper webpage.
The article is of awful quality, but not terribly wrong - however the good thing is it got spotted by one of the most verbal BTC supporters in Poland, which used it to leverage marketing for the first Bitcoin Conference in Poland, which is to take place in a couple of days. 
I think the publicity will be good, ultimately. Fiats are going down the drain, eventually, and people will start looking for alternatives. We had our trial hour - what we should do now is:
- make sure some reliable and distributed exchanges pop up on the radar
- make sure there is a lot of proper, correct information about fundamentals available for people seeking knowledge - remember that Bitcoin is first of all a *disruptive* technology, very unusual for the unfamiliar. And FUD is our worst enemy
- make sure that more and more traders start accepting BTC, and that useful tools appear. We had for example an accounting office in Poland which started accepting BTC and they actually helped customers to set it up - great concept! I too am willing to offer my trade (software quality consulting services) to anyone in need for some spare BTC. 
So the future will come, but it's up to us to either make or break it.

Can you imagine a holographic cube, where if you look one way - you see for example your business logo, the other way - and you see a BTC address? That would be some cool-ass shit. Or a morphing display - your business logo gets warped into a BTCQR every time a new payment address is generated (so for example for every new transaction). God damn it, the possibilities are endless, and we don't have to get stuck with those boring POSes
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:30:49
That's why phone wallets and NFC POSes must become reality! I love it how all the pieces are slowly falling into places.

I guess it's very good that (as of now) people are showing huge confidence in BTC. And seriously? Even if long term (say 1-2 years) the value were to drop a little, I still think this is an amazing long-long-term investment. Way better than my retirement fund, or whatever - that's why I'm going to invest systematically in BTC, even if these are to be small amounts.
