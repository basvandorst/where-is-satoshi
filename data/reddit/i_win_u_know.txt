lol Bitcoin will do no such thing. Anyone who thinks Bitcoin will have the capacity to handle even a fraction of the transactions visa has is delusional. Bitcoin must be dethroned if crypto is going to overtake visa. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 16:03:33
I'm order for a crypto to overtake visa, it will have to handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. Something Bitcoin will never be able to do. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 22:02:53
I think that because those are the facts. Bitcoin will never scale to visa's levels. It's not an opinion, it's a fact. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 18:05:32
LN puts Bitcoin nowhere near the amount of transactions visa has. Everyone here fails to realize this. Sure it technically is layer 2 but you're lying to yourself if you think Bitcoin will ever be ready for visa's amount of transactions. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 18:06:24
LN is not a solution that puts Bitcoin to visa's level of transactions per second. There are no plans that Bitcoin will ever do this. Time to move on.

Why does r/Bitcoin censor then? What do they have to hide? It takes just a little bit of research, and you'll easily see why Bitcoin is purposefully being held back. You can demean me all you want. The writing is on the wall.

Bad look for this sub.
@_date: 2018-09-13 22:08:39
It's called blockstream. This isn't anything new I'm telling you, but it doesn't take much more than a brain and two eyes to see the very powers Bitcoin was meant to destroy have taken ahold and thwarted progress. It's not tough to grasp. Why would the powers Bitcoin seeks to destroy just allow it to happen?
@_date: 2018-09-11 21:57:24
Lol, not with bitcoin we're not. You think bitcoin is even 10 years from handling global adoption? Something is going to dethrone bitcoin, because it has to.
@_date: 2018-09-13 22:04:26
But it doesn't. And it won't. Bitcoin is meant to be a store of value, not a crypto used to buy and sell goods. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 16:40:28


Because there is nothing on the horizon being done by BTC. Maybe it's BCH, or DASH, or something else that's equally as ridiculous, but BTC has no future plans to implement layer 2 solutions.
@_date: 2018-09-14 13:36:03
Just like the rest. Deflect, demean character, don't address any of the points given. You have some growing up to do yourself. I spent maybe 5 minutes total responding to you. This fake idea you have of me is more pathetic than any comment I've had so far. Maybe find a more productive way to participate in discussion, or move along. 
You probably own a cat and smell like cat piss. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 22:03:20
It won't though. Bitcoin is a store of value. That's it. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:19:21
I think it's a little too late to try and redeem this sub. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:25:48
This is a bad look for the sub. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 13:24:25
So is this just a make fun of something that shouldn't bother you sub now?
This is the only stuff that gets upvoted nowadays, and it's the reason why I steer clear of BTC. There's plenty of alts that aren't a huge pathetic circle jerk. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 13:41:15
Yeah, still not going to trust Bitcoin. His answers did not suffice.
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:39:51
It's funny because Bitcoin core folks literally do this. BCH's tech is superior and seeks to do what Bitcoin originally set out to do, but they refuse to see it and shame anyone who sees BCH for what it REALLY is.
@_date: 2018-10-20 16:44:28
Bitcoin = Big banks 
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:15:36
American Express should be promoting Bitcoin core. Wasn't it their devs that encouraged people use credit cards instead?
@_date: 2018-10-14 21:28:15
Lol BTC and mass adoption don't mix. The devs said so themselves. They're telling BTC users to literally use credit cards and fiat lmao!
Edit: downvotes = salt
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:53:59
lol it's funny how quickly Bitcoin core maximalists adopted the term "2nd layer" after ethereum. I've looked into it. Bitcoin's "2nd layer" refers to Bitcoin becoming centralized. These fast transactions will be a result of people trusting other people to confirm transactions. Aka: big banks disguised as blockchain. 
But go ahead and believe what you want. There's no reason a self proclaimed oligarchy in mining (by big banks) would want to stunt the growth of a technology that seeks to destroy big banks. 
Are you really that obtuse, or just trying to control the narrative?
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:03:17
Lol ok, that's fine and dandy, but it's still a bunch of big wigs deciding what the company is going to do. Last I checked, most millennials don't have enough to by the number of shares to determine the direction of a company. There's a really good comment below that pretty much says buying stocks is contributing to the corrupt system that crypto seeks to destroy. I got into crypto because big banks can suck a bag of dicks. 
And your second paragraph is laughable. Sure, when I buy crypto, I don't own part of a company that's blasting people like me in the ass. But when I buy crypto, it's taking money out of that system that's blasting me in the ass. It's why I'm in crypto. I own it. I DO. Not some shitty corporation that seeks to take my money some other way. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:43:57
Tell this to the top comment. The stock market is more of a joke than crypto. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:40:21
Nah. I like to own what I buy. I don't like a bunch of big wigs deciding what the company I own shares in is doing.  Nice try, but crypto is the future. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:42:25
The fact that you're claiming literally every crypto is a scam but Bitcoin makes me hesitant to believe anything you say. Top that with the fact the this sub is the only crypto sub that censors conflicting opinions. Bitcoin is shooting itself in the foot because of people like you. 
Edit: found a shill lol
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:54:54
I think there's plenty of promise elsewhere, maybe even better tech, and I think it's ignorant to think otherwise. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:00:27
Why is it always claimed bitcoin will do this, when pretty much anyone in the community knows that it's not bitcoin, but crypto?
