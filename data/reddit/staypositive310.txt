Gemini Trading is the best if you can qualify
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:37:53
Yes.  
@_date: 2017-08-29 01:20:11
Yes. Zero fees.  They're great and they are best for big legitimate purchases of BTC and ETH.  They do their due diligence on you though and it takes time but if you're serious about no fees out it's a good fit.

You're losing money ergo bitcoin but coinbase is very ethical so don't worry

Glad Fidelity is out in front with coinbase may spark the masses to buy only one bitcoin a piece.

This is already well known that is why bitcoin is actually law enforcement friendly in my humble opinion. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:05:52
I like Gemini trading the most to buy BTC, their data and pricing is spot on.  But takes a while to get approved and their fees are amazing to send zero.  
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:26:17
Follow the dollar for sure and see how weak it will be but given Chicago Board of options CBOE will be offering futures contracts (bitcoins need buying) will 100x the demand for free BTC and that ain't gonna be easy unless........
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:13:03
Unless you're willing to see BTC as a long term store of value you'll try to catch a falling knife and lose every time.  HODL and wait 5 years. 250,000 per BTC or more.  It's going to be approved in Japan HAS approved BTC (not BTH) South Korea, UK, Australia, it's being sold in Austrian post offices, Canadians are huge users of BTC as a payment system (not as a per se store of value), Singapore, CHINA (very smart people) and so many more in Africa, South America (Argentina), EU, Isle of Mann.  The US is lagging way behind but we're gaining momentum.  As both a payment system and store of value, and given the hash power, all other coins are second but not irrelevant.  
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:53:13
Should we all be excited by the scalable nature of SegWit or am I missing something.  
@_date: 2017-09-02 05:21:58
Buy more btc
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:29:59
BTC is being adopted by the Chicago Board of Option trading and as derivatives within the next 6 months or so.  I say hodl and buy more if you can afford to sit out the wild swings which you must.   Also do not Check price daily if you're not a trader IMO.  
@_date: 2017-09-03 07:04:11
No.  Just BTC long term.  
@_date: 2017-07-20 03:23:30
In any divorce there are monetary losses.  If we get a dual chain, each trying to convince everyone their bitcoin is the real slim shady, we all will lose a lot of money and progress for the future of mankind including how AI will pay for transactions.
