I can agree with the longevity before failure argument, they are all doomed to failure just that some fail faster than others. I would argue that what you are referring to as "capitalism" is an aberrant form due to the centralised banking fiat monetary system they typically are based upon. 
Pure capitalism would be based on free market competitive monetary structures with so-called free banking, which has not been bought to full fruition anywhere in the world AFAIK, but some period and countries have come close with good success before the mob showed up to wreck things. (Scotland, Panama). America has had a good run in hind sight.

It seems to me this is the way Bakkt remains a commodities futures operation  (ICE partner regulated by CFTC) but yet manages to open the door to settlements of all the major international currency crosses, i.e. essentially a global banking clearing function masquerading as a "commodity futures contract exchange" (that happens to have next day physical delivery of the underlying).
Edit: the allegory in the article is how they (Loeffler?) are sculpting the "regulated futures market" (a flawed piece of stone that other sculptors had rejected) into a beautiful, famous statue of David, (Bakkt) a la Michelangelo. 


If it was same day delivery it may come under SEC jurisdiction.

You're wrong. A security critical bug cannot create a hard fork, it's just created some nodes that have gone awol. I'm not sure what kind of definition you are using for a "hard fork" but it seems to be leading to nonsensical conclusions.

It's a little more nuanced than that too though, since bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins it might be arguable that some of the yet-to-be-mined coins add value to the total network present value also, as do "proven reserves" of gold/silver mines. The two extremes of this argument is to take total network value as market cap using pricex21million or total market cap based on currently available supply ... bike-shedding at that point though as it is probably somewhere in between the range.

I think a ramp makes a lot of sense. Just issue XX kBytes blockspace per block.
Then we can bikeshed on how to eventually ramp down on the ramp .... it probably needs to be some kind of decaying function since simple linear or super-linear growth leaves the problem open. I suggest ramp down the ramp every block halving so that fee pressure builds on a similar time/rate that reward subsidy drops.

A "big block" was defined as 1 MByte in 2010.
Your quote of 50% per year is incredibly optimistic, other studies which have been pointed out numerous times on r/bitcoin (which I assume you chose to ignore in your selection) show about 20% per year. Moreover 50% has been plucked out of context and slapped on as a wild assumption for the real connection/transmission speed growth on the real bitcoin network using real bitcoin data which could easily be slower again if recent investigations are anything to go by.
To be safe, you would first need to collect more data on the actual bitcoin network, given that it is a protocol layer involving messaging limited by 32MB message size that runs on top of TCP/IP. Then scale 1 MB up for the past 4 years ... you might get something close to what I would call a "big block".

No one has shown with any rigour, except more hand-waving, how those "long-standing trends in broadband and computing performance growth", you seem to claim exist with certainty, are translated into real numbers predicting bitcoin network performance.

@_date: 2015-06-01 06:47:57
Same conclusion I came to  . Use this growth as a technical hard limit for big block spam protection in conjunction with a dynamic soft limit to provide fee pressure for background spam protection, e.g. something like
    if total_fees_last_2016 &gt; K*total_reward_last_2016
        then max_blocksize = J*max_blocksize
for a dynamic limit that grows when fee pressure gets more than some percentage of reward, but only up to the hard limit. This would allow for smooth transition between reward-fee models in the long term also. We can study what K and J factors (functions?) are optimal to tweak.

No it is not all that uncommon ... and P2P networks need 2-way comms so using download or backhaul speeds for benchmarks is wrong.
Also many government filters interrupt, disconnect or throttle upload because they are trying to disrupt p2p file-sharing so even the ISP advertised speeds are bogus, you need to actually measure it on the network and over longer time frames to get good data on real world upload speeds.

There is no difference in my opinion where the source of funding comes from as that is merely a value judgement, i.e. red team versus blue team.
The fact there is a source of funding is sufficient to question any motives.

I think all of these "conflicted cheap accusations" stem from a fundamental misunderstanding and a reversal of cause and effect thinking. How is it that 9-out-of-10 clearly bright, up-to-speed technological minds are 'conflicted' even before they formed their company? That just doesn't make sense. Here's what makes sense.
These guys could see the writing on the wall long before anyone else, big blocks are not going to scale in the near future, the numbers just don't stack up at the railroad tracks (bandwidth) level of analysis. What does stack up is, and makes way more sense in terms of building out using known technology development templates, is that they see we can use the blockchain as an anchor to key in and secure higher layers. This is comparatively uncontroversial, many tech. stacks use layers to scale development. And many others also came to similar conclusions already in 2011 onwards.
So what did they do next? They set about forming companies to profit off higher layer technology development. Who can blame them? They just spent 2-3 years of their professional lives developing a public good platform that allows for permissionless innovation for FREE.
It is much like the electricity network DC versus AC battle. DC couldn't scale because transmission over distances becomes prohibitive in terms of the diameter of the wires needed to efficiently transport current. Tesla showed up with the AC, and Westinghouse realised this guy had the answer so formed a company to profit from what was clearly a superior tech. Bravo Tesla and Westinghouse for sticking to their guns and profiting off AC. Was Westinghouse 'conflicted'? C'mon, it's just a cheap smear tactic.
Scaling using layers is the obvious answer to anybody with systems experience. Bigger blocks are in the near term, and ultimately unsustainable, or immutable data would be ubiquitous and free, not scarce and valuable. Google could cache the entire WWW onto the blockchain in reductio ad absurdum. Unfortunately systems guys are in the minority and usually struggle articulating the vision of what a completed stack could look like.
Conflicted? No. Ahead of the curve? quite likely.

In the long term, the global networks that succeed are run on commoditised hardware, not specialist kit like ASIC miners.

@_date: 2015-06-01 12:52:54
There is a disconnect between fees and rewards until the network transitions to the low rewards regime. The rewards hugely subsidise the hashing power (security) early in this transition phase such that the fees are comparatively insignificant and the miners lack an incentive to develop the fee market at this low level. When rewards dwindle they will develop a functioning fee market that will then pay to secure the hashing power.
Devising a safe transitional regime between rewards to fees appears to be the crux of the problem here.

You probably also need to add in the bitcoin-killing extension to the big-block attack that the max_block_size limit was put in place to prevent.
A 51% miner attack using too-big-to-relay-in-10-minutes-blocks using contemporary bandwidth. (It would actually start kicking in before 51% but becomes game over at that point).
A regular 51% attack can double-spend their own TX but not an ELE.

Time does have an objective existence, clocks and watches are the most obvious manmade manifestations of this but the underlying physical processes timepieces exploit are the best evidence for the existence of time.

We are talking about all nodes, not just miners on 'high-end' connections (do such entites even exist?, most hashpower is in China who complain about poor upload connectivity). Also you're (purposely?) ignoring upload speed trends, etc, etc on the real bitcoin network (different comms protocol) using real bitcoin data transfers.
You can't just pull a law-of-bandwidth out of context and expect it to be directly applicable to the bitcoin network. That's just cartoon engineering, like the back-of-envelope speculations gavin is so fond of.

He simply ignores all the wallet software development and other infrastructure that will need to be put in place to have a functioning fee market.

In my mind a "payment channel", as described in the original literature regarding bitcoin smart contracts, is necessarily settled on the bitcoin blockchain.
I'm not sure whether statistical analysis of payment channel transactions is necessary, desirable or feasible.

It is better than putting a hard-coded number that you know will likely need to be changed in 5-10 years since the exponential growth estimate might not need to be changed if all goes well.

I think the word 'governed' is perfect for Gavin to use. It lets us know where he stands. It is safe to say that he clearly now stands with his [paymasters]( who have talking about ["governance"]( of bitcoin from day one and can be considered a voice of the establishment. 
The threat to hard fork can be considered a power grab since he doesn't have support of the core devs.
@_date: 2015-06-01 13:02:15
You could hardfork at any time that it seems like blocksize is "outpacing network technology". At best you have only 1 hardfork left to turn it off to contend with, if the growth is about right and then volume levels off such that growth is no longer needed. Scheduling hardforks every 2 years doesn't seem ideal.

Same conclusion I came to  . Use this growth as a technical hard limit for big block spam protection in conjunction with a dynamic soft limit to provide fee pressure for background spam protection, e.g. something like
    if total_fees_last_2016 &gt; K*total_reward_last_2016
        then max_blocksize = J*max_blocksize
for a dynamic limit that grows when fee pressure gets more than some percentage of reward, but only up to the hard limit. This would allow for smooth transition between reward-fee models in the long term also. We can study what K and J factors (functions?) are optimal to tweak.
@_date: 2015-06-17 23:29:51

It is a good point. there is no way he is withdrawing any significant portion of his managed portfolios into physical cash because the logistics of moving say 10% of GBP4 bill, i.e. 400 million is impractical.
So the question is why does he not do as he says for his clients? His motives here are to probably cause a run into cash which will benefit his other positions, short banks, bonds, etc. Not that that is a bad thing but it is worth noting that not even a small percentage &lt;1% of total financial asset wealth could be converted into physical cash today. However, physical cash itself today is now only a paper promise to pay which would probably become worthless in such a situation anyway. This ain't gonna be your grampappy's bank run.

Hearn has vested interests in these business models that rely on bigger blocks:
Lighthouse's 'crowdfunding' is more like tribe-funding because the size of the crowd is limited by the blocksize 
BitcoinJ will be better able to compete with the federated server models of Electrum and libbitcoin (currently it is getting smoked) so he becomes more relevant again.

Yes, but only coins and notes are bearer instruments like bitcoins.
If you don't have the keys it ain't your cash. Bank accounts and bonds requires third and sometimes other intermediaries, courts, bailiffs etc to ascertain true ownership. They are known as weaker forms of money, representative money, kind of like fiat derivatives. And fiat is a government promise (another counter party) to begin with anyway.

Let's put this ridiculous notion to sleep once and for ever ....
A node that mines is incentivised to mine by the block generation reward and fees, yes. Also any node can choose not to mine.
A node that keeps a full list of all transactions since the genesis block (a full storage node) is incentivised to do so for reasons of its own, data analysis, paranoid security, etc. In fact, almost all nodes do not keep this full record right now with varying levels of pruning being active in the Satosho client. Some nodes even keep a very limited set of the transactions db, SPV nodes, and choose to have a very small storage overhead.
Each node is incentivised to carry exactly as much storage overhead as its security and functionality requires.
If you believe that your node has ZERO incentive to carry any storage then you should build a node that carries no blockchain data whatsoever. But what would you have at that point? NOT a bitcoin node.
See? Every genuine bitcoin node has an incentive to run some level of storage overhead ....

@_date: 2014-09-04 21:37:27
There is another factor you haven't accounted for, the bitcoins mined today could be involved in transactions for decades. So if that is the case you need to amortise the cost of mining over the total life of the coins against all the total economic good they provide for all the transactions they will be involved in.
Like a piece of gold when it is mined, it can provide economic benefits as a transactional good for centuries.
So the 10% per year cost (right now) is paying for future economic benefits also, albeit mostly unquantifiable without a crystal ball. 
It is also connected to bitcoin's inherent collectability.

I like this proposal very much. It is searching for the solution in the right parameter space.
- a dynamic soft-limit with a negative feedback controller for linking rewards and fees to prevent spam (road markings)
- a physical hard limit to prevent network crash (guardrails)

Good piece. Wall St. absence was really something of mystery but I've heard first and second hand similar reactions, experiences. There is a sub-subset of traditional finance that 'gets it' but for now the majority just don't and seem to not want to think about it. In fact, I think maybe the majority are really not that smart or clued in to even get close .... perhaps some of the top guys but they are hedging for now.
It might be better for all concerned anyway if the next wave of new adopters are gamblers, cross-border transferees and millions of people in developing countries with limited access to banking stashing mBits on their smartphones. The tools are mostly there now for the majority of them to do this safely enough that the risk/complexity balances the benefits they gain. Wall St. will come when they figure it out and the convenience meets their risk/reward profile.

Open Transactions is the first implementation of a triple entry accounting system as foreseen by the cryptofinancial pioneers like Ian Grigg. Each signed receipt has the cryptographic signature of both parties to the transaction and the notary.
Bitcoin is different in that while the blockchain is immutable and viewable by both transacting parties, it does not notarise the transaction ... but some people call it triple-entry, which confuses the matter.

Not necessarily, they could get pretty good security, maybe perfectly adequate, for penny-stock transfers using merged mining. Or they could use the namecoin ledger which already has a big chunk of bitcoin merge-miners simultaneously securing it also. Or a merge-mined sidechain. They are just learning about this stuff so who knows what else they may come up with. 
Bitcoin is the gold standard for decentralised (trustless) secured transaction journalling but not everything needs gold standard security, or can afford it. It is also why graffitiing THE blockchain needs to be priced out of the market.

The reality is that freedom is not for most people. Oh sure, they'll pay lip service to it, but when push comes to shove and you tell them what sacrifices are necessary they'll roll over and accept restrictions in exchange for convenience.
It's going to shit and there's nothing you or I can do about it. Well we could push to accelerate it and bring about the necessary purge but that would be wicked on the other end of the scale.

Low fees are insufficient to protect the network. The blockchain is full of graffitti spam transactions and growing uncontrollably beyond bandwidth technology improvements. Bandwidth improvements wont support 16MB until 2026, at current improvement rates. We need some hard fee pressure, maybe from a dynamic soft block limit and a hard limit to stop the train going off the tracks totally into centralised, governmental control.

think the belief that miners can eventually be funded by a fee market is
wishful thinking. Thus, I am not against the proposed block size increase.However, the issue of long-term mining incentives remains. So far, the only proven method to incentivize mining has been direct block reward.


to put an end to the original block halving schedule, and to keep the
block reward constant (this is what Monero does, btw). That solution is
So it begins ... one "easy" solution increase blocksize to simple 20MB followed by another "easy" solution "just a little bit of inflation" to pay for them ...

Whole industries of compliance and wasteful intermediation are threatening to topple over like rotten old trees under force of the bitcoin bulldozer.

Thanks for interesting braindump elux. 
A massively distributed, chip-level hardware platform for general purpose virtual computing (cloud-like) and resource allocation negotiations between networked devices. The 21inc platform uses btc to secure the interconnects and fund the FLOPS and ACKS ... in a similar way that ether is the gas for ethereum contract instruction executions.
If 21 is building a general purpose distributed virtual computing stack, from hardware level up, instruction set, networking, crypto OS ... they got a lot of work to do ... :)  Like an 'ethereum' for Bitcoin ... but a btc which will then have an order of magnitude more utility than ether.
If bitcoin was the ENIAC, ethereum the UNIVAC 1103 then what 21inc are working on is the CDC 3000 or 6000 series equivalent DCPU (decentralised CPU).

He made the argument that mining 'on-board' the device meant you wouldn't have to access the satoshis at premium from somewhere else. A mining chip of this size is never going to earn a block of 25 btc and therefore will necessarily be sent the bitcoins from somewhere else ... in fact they are not sent but the keys the local wallet holds will be credited some on the blockchain. The whole description for that benefit is either disingenuous or misunderstands how bitcoin functions. So the mining chip will be generating a large amount of network activity communicating with the 21pool with 'getworks' and they are worried about generating satoshis locally to save costs?
Something doesn't add up.

I'm not twisting your logic, more correctly I am taking it to its logical absurd conclusion, reductio ad absurdum, is the latin phrase.
Now you need to define what a "sufficient" number of nodes is, and you see why we don't have consensus. Increasing transactions is not necessarily primary because we can build layer-2 solutions to increase capacity (number of transactions). In fact, I would say transaction volume has been demonstrated to not be primary but keeping the 'sufficient' number of nodes is primary.

Bitcoin's value is also largely being driven by medium of exchange function.
Shifting money easily, without permission, across borders and around the globe is a major use case that is growing rapidly. All that 'speculation' and 'storing of value' is based on some real world, rubber-meets-the-road, economic benefits that bitcoin provides to be valuable in the first place.

The fact that bitcoin is superior as a settlements/clearing network not payments has been obvious for a long time.

Core have not added it to their codebase because they see it as technically contentious and I agree with them. It is not cut and dried what is the best option at this point but it is definitely risky to hardfork in this environment so its a no go for them for now until is safe to do so.
Open Bazaar should have had payment channels in their dev roadmap from the get go ... so I do not have a lot of sympathy for butthurt due to bad planning (don't mention the conflict of interest in pushing to externalise costs of development onto blockchain bloat). StorJ maybe a similar situation but I don't know it in detail.
None of these questions are new, novel or unforeseen. Someone who was very close to Satoshi (if not himself) launched namecoin in 2011 to keep such blockchain database storage apps off bitcoin and then implemented merged-mining to give it the security hashing engine of bitcoin. These guys have totally dropped the ball by trying to stick every last blockchain app onto bitcoin's blockchain with merged-mining already developed, tested and working in 2011.
I tried to tell a lot of these VC's in 2013 they were putting money up for business models that ignored the upcoming challenges of the underlying bitcoin protocol but they didn't want to hear a bar of it ... so what can you do?

They use teams to program HFT algos and sophisticated hardware stacks, high speed communications, etc to hack the markets. They play by whatever 'rules' are set, right up to the legally questionable boundaries, even right around the rules, inside the loopholes and then get laws changed.

I would deny that "utility of a money depends on the amount of people using it".
Network effect is indeed the metric but for a monetary network it is the amount of *value* using the network not the amount of people.
1.2 billion in India use rupee, does that make it strong? Same for 1 billion people using Chinese yuan. To further the point the yuan recently shows strength because of the value of economic activity China now commands, not the number of people which have been mostly constant throughout its appreciation. The two are weakly related but not directly and inarguably as you are stating as fact.

How do you throttle the bandwidth? Do you limit the number of connected nodes or stop relaying a percentage of transactions? Or something else?
Tunable bandwidth throttling seems like it might have a wider appeal if you could make that code available as a script or module for other full node operators.

FUDster strikes with a post playing the victim as FUDster ... a cunning plan indeed. But here's the thing, you are (intentionally?) conflating the network and the tradeable asset token, while the banksters want to politically separate the blockchain network from the currency, yet can't.
The technical reason why the network will/must be a settlement layer is simple, read this:
- the network on average moved 200k TX daily last month
- 6 months before that it moved approx 100k TX daily
- 12 months before that it moved approx 50k TX daily
Some simple b.o.e. calcs say that in 3-6 months time we will hit a 400k TX daily demand and soon after that 800k daily. The exponential TX growth demand is right now going parabolic and it DOESN"T MATTER how big we raise the blocksize it technologically cannot handle it in the near, medium and probably longer terms also. It is better to hit the limit sooner rather than later to see what needs fixing and then raise as the technology allows under the normal operational conditions that bitcoin will be saturated at the max_block_size for the forseeable future.

You use the same logic that was used to explain to everyone, when bitcoin was worth 10cents, that it would defintiely fail because it was a deflationary currency and that meant everyone would buy it and not spend it so that would make the price go down.

I'm anything but confused this looks like the classic silicon valley patina of something radical 'decentralised' with a good dose of bait 'n switch into a data-mining dragnet when users come to practically use it ... sacrificing privacy for convenience. At least be honest with yourselves.
Onename requires an email for registration into a central server, how is that not centralising?
I said 'require .... to easily use'.
Yes it is "optional" but come on which mainstream user is going to to go through the full rigamarole to use a fully decentralised human-radable naming service? Looks like the business model is built on the bet that lazy humans will always sacrifice valuable, marketable personal information in exchange for convenience, and mixed in with a dirty little bit of deceit too.

Yes. Have a look at the Open Transactions project for a bitcoin-backed blinded bearer certificate type of system. Highly scalable, very low computational cost on the transactions but you give up some security to necessary auditing (and/or provable reserves) of the issuer.

It is marginally useful for the network if you know that no-one else is running a full node from the same physical site (which is going to be near on impossible to find out for most VPS providers). If someone else is running a full node from the same physical site then you are adding next to nothing to bitcoin networks' distributed redundancy.
For your own personal benefits, you may gain convenience by connecting a local SPV client to the cloud full node but you will never know 100% what the security of that node is since you do not control the physical layer. Malware, spyware, data-harvesting, DDOS, firmware corruption ... the list is pretty long.

The other side is strangely silent on this crucial point.
When is it exactly they think is the optimal time to hit the blocksize limit? All they ever say is "not now". So if not now then when is it and how do they justify that with engineering or economic arguments?
@_date: 2015-05-27 01:24:22
Bitcoin will only scale to "universal currency' with additional layers. It is not "pushing the problem off", bitcoin NEEDS new layers yesterday.
Increasing blocksize too much now will only delay the development of those desperately needed new layers risking that they will never get built and hinder the ecosystem forever.

1) You may be right about burst bandwidth for new block notifications but most of the nodes who need that are using the fast relay network already.
2) Zero-conf is completely useless so that part is a moot point.
Thin-blocks seems like a nice approach that needs looking into but it depends on what the node's requirements are, I expect we will get more delineation as the specific requirements for different node use cases becomes apparent from market forces. Which is why the layered architecture approach is the obvious way to proceed in a broad sense. Think of the Satoshi client as a prototype, monolithic implementation that can be spun off into many different directions/layers.

@_date: 2016-01-21 00:03:40
IF those million chinese ever show up we can bump the blocksize if/when fees get out of control high ... right now that looks like a slim possibility and other transaction capacity upgrades might get rolled out quickly also when the profit models become apparent. Risk/reward doesn't stack up for a risky hardfork, today.

Correct, there is little discernible objective difference between a **Miner Activated Hard Fork - MAHF** and the much-discussed 51% hostile mining attack.

Exactly. Jihan has a lot on the line by developing/owning the fab shop and largest mining operation, it centralises the risks (and rewards) enormously. The less ASICs he sells to outsiders the more he internalises the fab shop development cost risk. Concentrated risk and control is what bitcoin is designed to solve, so presently he represents a manifestation of a flaw in the protocol.
He needs to tread very, very carefully to get himself out of that minefield he's been lured into.

I'm starting to get a bad feeling about OB ... too much hype leading up to the actual launch can easily lead to disappointment from over-inflated expectations.
Also the way drwasho and brianhoffman have spent an inordinate amount of time throwing weight around to try and influence the bitcoin capacity development debate (which they aren't well qualified to do imho) bodes ill for OB. What are they worried about? Has the OB tent been built on a technical foundation of sand?

Well the demands for Core to commit to a date for a HF blocksize increase seems like an opening to demand a date, even if approximate, for when the first "fee event" system test (which will require numerous upgrades and security overhauls) will be scheduled also.
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:03:08
And I bet the miners are thinking for the long term "if we have control we can HF to keep rewards going forever ..." ... assuming they are greedy enough to block developments like segwit over the perceived loss of some paltry fees.

Segwit was developed, implemented and tested through a Herculean effort by a large team of collaborating developers imho in record time. Subsequently political manoeuvrings have squandered most of that time advantage leveraging miners to block roll-out for non-technical reasons. Your pointing your rifle at the wrong camp in that regard.
The long-term solution is far from "meaningless", it is essential and needs to be in place before 2020 at the latest.

Why not 74% or 76%?
@_date: 2015-05-27 10:37:38
Increasing blocksize incorrectly means that fees will not rise to compensate for decreasing reward schedule as designed. At which point, the calls will come to keep the reward at some "low" inflation number, say ~2.25%, to incentivise the mining. These calls have already started by the way ... read above.
tl;dr make sure fees never work then call for continued mining reward to 'fix' it aka inflation.

I think I'm beginning to really like this guy Wang Chun.
All developers have to treat miners (and all users) as untrusted entities, it's nothing personal, it is simply the nature of adversarial network design where the participants cannot be trusted. There is probably some mix-up in the translation to Mandarin when devs say things like "malicious miners" or "misbehaving nodes", "bad actors" etc which are simply crypto-jargon terms for categorising and conceptualising all the adversarial threats on the network.
It wouldn't be helpful if good guys on the mining side felt targeted or treated like enemies because of some misunderstandings and poor translations (or god-forbid, intentional misinformation spreading).

All this is prefaced on that LN even becomes popular, it may be a flop or have a flaw in practice that makes it non-viable. The demand for high-security settlement TX that take 6 confirms (~ 1 hour) is only going to grow and LN TX only overlap minimally with that market (instantaneous). The miners are the natural operators for the main LN routing hubs. LN users opening and closing channels will preferentially pay miner LN nodes since they are able to most likely (guarantee?) ensure these critical TX occur securely.
Finally developers have gone out their way to ensure that on-chain fees are a critical part of considerations since in the medium to long-term the whole network security POW incentive is transitioning to fee-based from rewards-based. Whoever wrote this has not been keeping up with developments or is viewing through a very miner-centric lens and has probably been misinformed on the motives of developers.

You could/should do this on the Namecoin blockchain. Namecoin has merged mining so has a large proportion of the bitcoin hashing power securing it, i.e. probably good enough for what you are doing here.
It will cost you a fraction of the cost of using bitcoin, the data fields have been designed to handle exactly these kind of applications ... and the namecoiners will welcome your business. The code bases are almost identical now with Namecoin client rebasing on Core recently so any coding changes required will be minimal.

Not really, because the original meaning of cash was for the paper notes that were bearer instruments representing redeemable wharehouse receits for precious metal deposits. Over the years that has morphed into all kinds of other meanings for 'cash' with the 'evolution' of fiat currencies and diluted backings of paper notes. To the point that nowadays people can use cash to mean anything from a paper debt note, that can only be used to redeem into other debts (not at all a bearer instrument) to an electronic number representation of these paper debt notes in a bank database that is a liability belonging to the account holder who thinks it represents 'cash'.

There was no such thing as 'normal' meaning of electronic cash before bitcoin so that was the only was he could have been using that meaning.

Came to here to say this. Also an enhanced change like SW allows more apps to attach to the network giving the underlying currency, bitcoin, more potential value as a technology for storage and transfer of value.
They truly seem to be stupid enough to be working against their own best interests, or have ulterior motives.
@_date: 2016-01-12 04:19:47
I think a lot of the redditard DevHate is driven simply by underlying envy.
They know they will never achieve such heights so seek to drag down by any angle of ridicule or perceived infraction of common-sensibilities. In essence, just basic petty jealousy.
I don't see it improving any time soon and most likely will drive most of the current core devs away, who will inevitably be replaced by more mediocre, bland, 'palatable' political animals that are soothing for the masses. Because they will not envy mediocrity like themselves and will no longer be filled with jealous DevHateRage.

The blocking of SegWit by the "big blocks emergency" crowd (which morphed into BU because we-know-best-therefore EC bandwagon) is extremely short-sighted and there is an element of vindictiveness to it also I think.
It'll be looked back upon as an error by this 'faction' in gaining any future credence or merit towards influencing bitcoin's evolution. Their scorched-earth attacks against the core devs seems to stem more from some badly bruised egos (or VC-funded bust business models) and not any serious technical arguments that stand up to scrutiny.
Bitgold is the El Dorado for the cypherpunks.

We will inevitably have a "fee event" (thanks Garzik for the scare phrase soundbite) at some stage in the Bitcoin's network future, unless it fails miserably and becomes entirely unpopular. Hitting the max_block_size is a genuine measure of success or spam, so we can only know it is genuine with fees rising upon hitting max_block_size.
It is technically preferable that we have this "fee event" sooner rather than later in bitcoin's development, think of it like a live system test for the future. After we demonstrate/debug/test the network functioning in fee-paying mode and much of the ancillary surrounding wallets and upper layers have been prepared to handle such events then we are in good shape for the future. If it is by then demonstrated that raising the max_block_size is safely within the current technological limits of the day then we may not have another "fee event" for years but will be better prepared in the case such a future outcome arises, predictably or unexpectedly. It will be another belt to the braces of the max_block_size bitcoin already possess. A functioning fee market infrastructure held in reserve is another level of robustness for the medium term and something that is inevitably necessary to develop/implement for the long term transition to fee driven security model anyway.
We should not put this off, bite the bullet and do this now, design for success.

Satoshi uses electronic cash in the classical sense, as do all cypherpunks since Chaum's seminal paper on the subject, i.e. private, p2p, bearer instrument (the user controls the private keys offline). 
The payment system of the bitcoin network is bound by its technological limitations. It can be compared somewhere between the current legacy settlement and electronic payments systems, which themselves are evolving rapidly with technology.

Actually it is the problem of relative rent versus salary ... rents have inflated at the rate of inflation for 3-4 decades while regular salaries have been almost stagnant.

Yeah, that might be quite an interesting combination of variables to use ... you could tinker with the weightings a bit also to come up with something more predictive of the 'market sentiment', psychology, confidence or whatever you want to call it. Like monetary stock for example is extremely widely held, every person has dollars in their wallets, checking or savings accounts that is ready to trade for goods at any instance (supply) and mostly people will accept dollars for goods so the other side is always balanced by an equal breadth and depth of demand. But if there is some kind of fiat crises of confidence suddenly all that stock can appear on the supply side of the market, looking to get out at any price, e.g. Venezuela.

Except no one would have followed the chain with the broken "changed rules" (as you call them), so it was at best an orphan branch.

I think they should implement payment channels. So that they don't ever get full control of your bitcoin and you can just bet in portions up to the amount you place in the channel.
They could then add on bidirectional channels and user-user direct bitcoin TX options later, essentially bitcoin casinos are a natural first application for payment channel hubs.

You're most likely insinuating there is some "miners having hard time with Core segwit" issue with the upgrade to the compiler requirement to C++11.

Then lo 'n behold here's the evidence that shows up conveniently inside a massive dragnet operation, who woulda thunk judge?!

Where did you lose the plot so badly? You seemed to have your head screwed on right at one point.
Their business model is based on what the underlying technology can handle (also they have a very broad remit ... just develop and see what infrastructure needs building). It's just too bad very few others had the foresight to see the writing on the wall. Bitcoin was always going to be a settlement network, it's just the nature of it when you run the numbers, unless it becomes centralised and then it is not interesting, just another PayPal. Why do you think I was so interested in OT before those monetas asshats scuttled that project? It is ideal for a scaling layer. OT/LN are solutions to bitcoin's scaling while remaining decentralised and you are pushing for more centralisation ... I just don't know where you are coming from.
They have no 'fiduciary interest' in LN, they only started looking into it a month ago. Next month they could be developing on OT and then what would you be saying?

A miner who would do this has a similar motivation as a sustained 51% attack, to destroy bitcoin, i.e. they are not going to care they missed out on 1 block reward (that they just made worthless) ... yet it is orders of magnitude cheaper than a sustained 51% attack. The cost to prevent such an indigestible block attack needs to be equal to, or larger (~same O()) than, the total value stored in the Bitcoin system .... ergo block limit necessary. Hacky, ugh, yes, but necessary for now until we get our thinking caps on.
Optimistically we can come up with a similar mechanism to the difficulty targeting adjustment where an honest majority can enforce a suitable blocksize limit. Then the cost to attack with 'too large' blocks is similar as a 51% attack. The parameter space has several variables that complicates it greatly but I don't think it is intractable. Your paper is a good start mapping out some relations in the BTC/kByte costing space. For example, it maybe that we can come up with a good system that incentivises full nodes towards specialist hardware development (as we have seen amazingly in the fpga/ASIC miner frontiers) that will allow transaction volume growth above technological rates of commodity hardware/bandwidth (another reason not to bake in a growth rate). But how would the network know this was happening in meatspace? Appropriate feedback mechanisms need to be found that allow the free fee market to develop naturally as it takes over from reward issuance and maintain a secure blocksize limit but allows for 'paid for' capacity growth.

Witholding your funds to extract identity information is something akin to extortion (althought I'm sure the men with guns have made some rules to that effect so it is LBC's choice to exploit them). Worse than that they are imposing themselves, or threatening to impose themselves, as a potentially capricious 3rd party in the middle of every LBC transaction, so should stop calling themselves peer-to-peer (false advertising).

I have been following the recent block size debates through the mailing list.  I had hoped the debate would resolve and that a fork proposal would achieve widespread consensus.  However with the formal release of Bitcoin XT 0.11A, this looks unlikely to happen, and so I am forced to share my concerns about this very dangerous fork.
The developers of this pretender-Bitcoin claim to be following my original vision, but nothing could be further from the truth.  When I designed Bitcoin, I designed it in such a way as to make future modifications to the consensus rules difficult without near unanimous agreement.  Bitcoin was designed to be protected from the influence of charismatic leaders, even if their name is Gavin Andresen, Barack Obama, or Satoshi Nakamoto.  Nearly everyone has to agree on a change, and they have to do it without being forced or pressured into it.  By doing a fork in this way, these developers are violating the "original vision" they claim to honour.
They use my old writings to make claims about what Bitcoin was supposed to be.  However I acknowledge that a lot has changed since that time, and new knowledge has been gained that contradicts some of my early opinions.  For example I didn't anticipate pooled mining and its effects on the security of the network.  Making Bitcoin a competitive monetary system while also preserving its security properties is not a trivial problem, and we should take more time to come up with a robust solution.  I suspect we need a better incentive for users to run nodes instead of relying solely on altruism.
If two developers can fork Bitcoin and succeed in redefining what "Bitcoin" is, in the face of widespread technical criticism and through the use of populist tactics, then I will have no choice but to declare Bitcoin a failed project.  Bitcoin was meant to be both technically and socially robust.  This present situation has been very disappointing to watch unfold.

@_date: 2015-07-15 06:00:37
I'm glad someone here is happy to put real numbers to these problems. Here's a worrying new bottleneck that I think the spam testing has shown up that I haven't seen discussed elsewhere, afaik.
As the mempool fills up two immediate questions for any node jump right out:
- how big shall I let the mempool get?
- which transactions shall I dump first to keep the mempool size sensible?"
The first question is going to be node-dependent and immediately leads to a conclusion about the min spec. for a bitcoin fully-validating node (non-mining specifically). The second question has more facets to it but basically lower-fee TX and then older TX that aren't making it into blocks can be dumped.
For arguments sake let's say the mempool is being kept maximally full by spam, plus other genuine TX, continuously in the case of sustained attack. A policy of dumping TX older than ~2 days means that an optimal size of the mempool to target will be around 288 blocks worth, or little less accounting for less than full blocks. The logic here is if you set your dust limit (minrelaytxfee) at such a level that the mempool holds around 256*max_block_size of TX then it is targetting similar capacity mempool as removing TX that are 2 days old.
So what this means is any **fully-validating node needs to have RAM capacity for ~256*max_block_size mempools**. An 8MB block will require a min spec. for RAM of 2GByte for mempool alone to be effective as minimally forwarding node holding only 2 days worth of TX in RAM. Under BIP101 this will be RAM requirements of 4 GByte in 2018 and 8GByte in 2020 for nothing but mempool.

I have been following the recent block size debates through the mailing list.  I had hoped the debate would resolve and that a fork proposal would achieve widespread consensus.  However with the formal release of Bitcoin XT 0.11A, this looks unlikely to happen, and so I am forced to share my concerns about this very dangerous fork.
The developers of this pretender-Bitcoin claim to be following my original vision, but nothing could be further from the truth.  When I designed Bitcoin, I designed it in such a way as to make future modifications to the consensus rules difficult without near unanimous agreement.  Bitcoin was designed to be protected from the influence of charismatic leaders, even if their name is Gavin Andresen, Barack Obama, or Satoshi Nakamoto.  Nearly everyone has to agree on a change, and they have to do it without being forced or pressured into it.  By doing a fork in this way, these developers are violating the "original vision" they claim to honour.
They use my old writings to make claims about what Bitcoin was supposed to be.  However I acknowledge that a lot has changed since that time, and new knowledge has been gained that contradicts some of my early opinions.  For example I didn't anticipate pooled mining and its effects on the security of the network.  Making Bitcoin a competitive monetary system while also preserving its security properties is not a trivial problem, and we should take more time to come up with a robust solution.  I suspect we need a better incentive for users to run nodes instead of relying solely on altruism.
If two developers can fork Bitcoin and succeed in redefining what "Bitcoin" is, in the face of widespread technical criticism and through the use of populist tactics, then I will have no choice but to declare Bitcoin a failed project.  Bitcoin was meant to be both technically and socially robust.  This present situation has been very disappointing to watch unfold.

Look into -minrelaytxfee=0.0001 and -limitfreerelay=5 command line or bitcoin.conf file settings options to control mempool size. These options also have the net effect of giving autonomy to the nodes to decide what they consider useless transactions to forward and save to mempool.

I think you may have fundamentally misunderstood what the blocksize limit is in place for, and your paper seems to reflect that. While you concentrate on capacity and fee markets as core tenets, you have not addressed the security aspect of a malicious miner producing large (indigestible) blocks.
It is not at all about ideology, except maybe in the sense of a disagreement in design philosophies. First bitcoin needs to be technically secure or else it is worthless and endless fee market analyses will not help much in that regard when considering the no-limit block scenario. No one arguing from the no-limit block angle can prove that Bitcoin would be technically secure, afaik.

So far we have not yet had 5 years since satoshi said that. Now tell me do "bandwidth and storage seem trivial" right now for "whatever size micropayments you need"? Clearly not, we need to let the clock run some more. 5 years was a best case scenario estimate out into unknowable future.

I like how even though the total number of unconf TX has stayed high the total btc value of the unconf tx has come down from ~100k to 45k and dropping. Which means that initially higher valuer tx were caught up in the backlog but now the fee market has started working (amazingly bootstrapped inside a few days) then the lesser-value/spammier tx are now the predominant unconf. Eventually the spam will be dropped off the mempool and with better mempool management (that core devs have already worked on foreseeing exactly this scenario) it will get culled out post haste.

What this guy is suggesting is the benign version of what will actually happen. Picture this: 
- there are &gt; 14 million bitcoins on each side of a hardfork , one with large block capability and one without
- it is easy to write a smart contract that will detonate on occurrence of the fork or a 'too large' block
- a certain percentage of those coins owners do not want to hold the 'other' coin at any cost
- coin owners can dump the coins they own on the unwanted fork into a TX spamming bot bomb that spams the hell out of the chain on the unwanted fork at smart contract trigger
- the large block fork defences will need to be to superior to the small block fork in the same measure as the increase in blocksize they allow
"'Tis a dangerous web we weave when at first we seek to deceive."
There are no good outcomes from a hard fork not based on consensus. On the contrary, the economic incentives ensure they will be nasty, it is the way the system was built. Play along or leave.

The mempool 'fullness' (per node selectable) feeding back to a floating minrelaytxfee combined with timed cleaning of mempool is a very elegant solution to quite a few problems.
It means TX that are not making it into blocks are dropped and those that in all probability will never make it into blocks (spam) are not even relayed around the network. It cleverly, and correctly dynamically expands 'dust' TX treatment to spam when the network is flooded.

My aim was to point out that the claim "we won't see 8MB blocks for years" is dangerously focusing on the capacity question not the security question. It would be dangerous to assume some level of omniscience that all advantageous angles/incentives opened up by large blocks can be known a priori. I.e. if 8MB (or XX blocks) can break bitcoin in some way it will be advantageous to some party somewhere and attempted is a safe assumption.
The question for me is really, "with today's technology, can we defend 8MB blocks?" ... maybe. Obviously we would all like more capacity and if bitcoin is popular it will likely fill up what ever capacity it can defend, given the current technology and for some years yet still. The Internet itself is the same in that regard, a DDOS attack is not much different than an overload due to a popular event/incident, e.g. "Kim K. sat down on Facebook and broke it". Except with bitcoin/money if we had a "Kim K. sat down on the blockchain and broke it" moment it would be good to know it could fail gracefully and get back up again.

Doubling down with the biggest Martingale bet in history using the collateral of the combined G7's state assets was not a smart move.

Either it was intentional FUD or he was wrong.
We have seen fee pressure and it is the future. Now how do we keep blocksize at just the right fee pressure I wonder, hmmm?
    if total_fees_last_2016 &gt; K*total_reward_last_2016
    then max_blocksize = J*max_blocksize
for a dynamic limit that grows when fee pressure gets more than some percentage of reward, but only up to the hard limit. This would allow for smooth transition between reward-fee models in the long term also. We can study what K and J factors (functions?) are optimal to tweak.

Worse was that luke-jr was right about BIP16/17 and now we have to carry Gavin's P2SH screw-up technical debt baggage with us forever ... and the BIP 70 payment protocol was almost as big of POS privacy backdoor that no-one uses anyway ... more technical debt.

Are they really the nutjobs or is it the establishment economists who have bought ultra-centralised monetary system and now insane things like negative interest rates, cash bans and levels of debt that have become mathematically impossible to pay back yet they call for more debt?!
How can a society function economically if the most basic unit of trade, money, is subject to flights of fantasy like these? To me it looks like a Soviet Union style collapse is coming for the economies based on the global system of centralised banking.

Hi Justus ... specific specification sounds redundantly redundant.

No. Just stop.
Some of it definitely looks like a genuine bump in transactions. A big chunk was a clever 'spamming' of low-value tx that had a fee just-above-default fee that most dumb static-fee wallets use. Some of it is due to other excitables piling-on sending complete garbage tx that will just get dumped eventually.
Most genuine fee paying transactions are going through and mempool/fee-handling code development is being prioritized now (long overdue) with some real world data to work on.
tl;dr all good.

The masses appear to be comfortable being controlled and coddled by jealous masters.

@_date: 2016-02-22 05:29:43
The process is explicitly clear, you need to get the approval of the network to run your code in an overwhelming majority. And you need to do that by convincing the nodes with science and data-backed justifications, not politicking.
Gavin's paucity of data-backed arguments and technical soundness has been shameful, as has his politically-timed outbursts which stoke the rumours of his possibly compromised agenda. Comp. science can indeed solve this, but not how Gavin (or Mike) are doing it.

Au contraire, I'm getting the horrible sense of deja vu ... like Coinbase is morphing in to Mt.Gox2.0, Mt. GoxReloaded or whatever you want to call it.
A centralised service that became an exchange where people stupidly left many coins for safe keeping (web wallet), with a high profile leader who clearly has ambitions to be a 'mover 'n shaker' in influencing bitcoin's 'direction'. 
tl;dr a big fat target of coins susceptible to hacking, coercion, corruptibility, etc by govt. or other bad actors.

The HK agreement was a set-up from the beginning. The devs who went there to "do a deal' with the miners were stupid to think it was anything but sitting down to deal with the devils themselves. It is clear now the miners were never discussing any changes in good faith but were all there simply to make sure they could game the situation secretly to their best advantage.
You can bet that devs will never ever go near any kind of 'collaborative agreement' with double-dealing, lying, cheating ASIC miners. It's a den of thieves, the whole ASIC mining shit show has been a disaster for bitcoin since the rorts started back in 2014.

The miners have their own TX selection algorithms for filling blocks, usually higher fee TX go in blocks first. Stale TX that hang around in the mempools without ever getting into blocks for whatever reason just get dropped eventually. There is dev work to more actively manage the Core node mempools and drop off spammier (dust) TX with regular cleaning or not even relaying them if the mempool is filling up, which has now gained some new impetus.

No. There is no "one true" mempool network wide, each node has it's own version, loosely the same though. E.g. If your mempool got too big you could just stop your node, start it again with empty mempool and it would take quite a long time to fill up again.

Somewhat true, the modern versions of cash have morphed into central bank debt notes and other bearer instruments, clearly a liability since they are money substitutes for the precious metals they formerly represented. 
Bitcoin is closer to the historical meaning of cash, liquid without liabilities. Hence the "digital gold" label I guess.

If we are getting pedantic and rigorous in our definitions then first begin with the blockchain. It is NOT a ledger but more correctly a journal, that records every transaction. The 'ledger' is the UTXO (unspent transaction output) set contained within and must be extracted or searched (parsed) before knowing who owns what.
So 
i) multiple copies of a transaction journal are held and verified by a consensus of the distributed nodes
ii) the ledger is the UTXO subset contained within the journal (blockchain)
That might give you some better technical foundations for a correct and useful refinement.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security." - Declaration of Independence

You're conveniently obscuring why the debt note of the Fed. Res. was needed to be legislated as "Legal Tender" ... I'll explain a little since you don't want to, in all courts of law you cannot extinguish a debt with another debt. Extinguishing of a debt demands redemption in full, by all logic, reason and legal precedent.
This is why debt 'money' needs to be specifically labelled as "Legal Tender" on the debt note itself or it would be unworkable in courts of law for the extinguishing of debts.
It's not as simple as you are making out. In fact, it is incredibly complicated and convoluted as a consequence of Fed. Res. debt note currency being a legislative hack to get around the US constitutional limits prohibiting the issuance of elastic money, like an infinitely expandable fiat paper currency supply.

It's likely that the "internet of early 90's" analogy is going to be incorrect in its details, mostly because all analogies breakdown at some level of comparison. Also, I've been thinking more recently that the "TCP/IP of money" protocol level analogy is also going to miss the mark for the reason that it is too close an analogy that underestimates the absolutely basic nature of the invention.
Yes, bitcoin is a wire comms. protocol like TCP/UDP/HTTP/SMTP etc but it is also quite a bit more than all of those. It is the first demonstration of a virtual verifiable grid machine operating on top of an untrusted networked, cloud-processing base layer. Granted, the task that it is performing is mundane, that of a simple transaction processing engine and record keeping, but then so were the tasks of the early computers usually simply glorified adding machines, (read IBM's history), if not code breaking.
Think about what bitcoin is; it has an ISA (instruction set architecture)- the OP_CODES, the mempool and UTXO (somewhat analogous to RAM and I/O) and the blockchain (analogous to long-term storage albeit immutable, i.e. HDD). It is a virtual machine operating as trusted, distributed processor on top of an untrusted, networked grid hardware layer. In comparison, I would say we are at a similar level of development as say 10-12 years after the arrival of ENIAC

Monetas sucked most of the oxygen out of the open source project to get their venture flying and now has recently gone closed source.
It is arguable whether the voting pools concept would have ever worked in practice because of the synchronous vs. asynchronous conflict requirements of the notary-client TX signing and the audit server to notary communications.
Payment channel hub-spoke or even multi-hop off-chain TX routing, which may be able to encorporate blind signing, and sidechains seem like better solutions all around anyway.

Precisely. The economists are essentially doubling down now with public policy rhetoric (war on cash, etc, etc) after all the failed Keynesian monetary experiments that are causing this explosion of wealth seeking refuge from crazy Central Bank economists monetary experiments. The ultimate conclusion is totalitarian facist economies because the economists won't admit they are wrong and accept responsibility for destroying the economic, financial and monetary systems and setting back humanity by decades.
If the Keynesian economists admit they were wrong now they would be hanged, and not before time either.

but "bitcoin is blah-de-blah blah fud fud .."
"oh how can it be that bad, there's only 21 million of them!?"
"it's harmless, there only ever be 21 million."
Logic-free emotional memes like this are remarkably effective for mainstream appeal. They don't want to think too hard and it gives a warm feeling that it is not threatening, scary, difficult thing to be feared. 21 million is a number that can be comprehended, most people cannot tell you how many millions in a billion, let alone a trillion. Misinforming, gross over-simplification arguments like these have worked very well for pushing fiat and inflation into universal acceptance for a century.

If you think blockchain is the crucial concept behind bitcoin that will transform financial services you have sadly missed the point.
The crucial concept is none other than the re-discovery of simple, raw free market capitalism, something previously slowly moved away from and now totally banished from capital money markets.
A distributed free market for money is the secret that makes bitcoin work more so than the chained hashing of transaction block files.

This is probably just the 'hot wallet'. i.e. spending money he left lying around if you found it in "desktop shortcuts".  Frankly I'm skeptical of your claims because you don't detail the type of wallet (bitcoin-qt, electrum, etc) or what method you used to check addresses, etc, verify the balances.
If this is just the hot wallet then it is likely there is a cold wallet with significant holdings somewhere else amongst his digital estate. AFAIK it is yours by law if you purchased the property that exclusively contains the physical bitcoin keys.

This is where you, and many others major misunderstanding lies.

Hub-spoke payment channels can be done in an untrusted manner with multi-sig and ntimelock. Lightning seems to be suggesting a form of off-chain TX routing using networked hubs, it seems plausible but the mechanics need to be worked out.
Also it may be that the hubs could participate in the channels with blinded signatures, and all that entails.

The economy that allows more individual privacy in financial affairs is more efficient due to lower total friction of money flows, less inhibition by participants to engage (no chilling effects) and generally more vibrant (adaptive) due to experimentation with new innovations, on all scales of economic activity.
Jurisdictional arbitrage will mean better economies based on better policies will outperform those that have highly-centralised structures and top-down imposed rules. In the end, the Soviet Union and the communist Eastern bloc just imploded in a heap of wasted, ineffective churn. TPTB cannot impose such restrictive policies from on top and not expect consequences from such gross meddling in individual micro-economic affairs.
Better money makes better economies, the lesson from history is clear and they ignore it at their peril, and many of ours unfortunately.

No it's not ignorance. The monetary system is totally broken. Wealth inequality figures tell you all you need to know about how broken the monetary system is in ultimately providing a fair and equitable system of wealth distribution in accordance with healthy civilised societies.
If you want to dig further take a look at the Fed's ballooning balance sheet of zombie bank assets and other 'dead body' debts leftover from the financial crises that had a huge TARP pulled over them. GAAP rules were suspended by an act of congress so bankster CEOs didn't go to prison for 'trading while insolvent', mark-to-market assets that were worthless were given fictitious mark-to-model valuations and then used to back the next bubble in a pyramid scheme for the ages. For anybody that can do basic accounting there is no doubt the monetary system is totally busted.

I find it really interesting how he is telling them *exactly* what they want to hear ... and when they applaud and express agreement he makes a point of repeating and emphasising *what they want to hear*.
It's like watching all those other trainwrecks that humans produce when a mob of willing true-believers link up with an evangelical. These people are clamouring to be misled and taken advantage of, it's pretty sad and stunning at the same time.

The halving will be "priced in" on the day of the halving.
100 days after the halving, 180,000 less coins coming to market will be priced in.
200 days after halving, 360,000 less coins will be priced in.
If $480 was approx. break even mining cost before halving, $960 will be approx. break even mining cost after halving. Simple linear interpolation gives us an approx. $720 target for the day of halving ... allow some smoothing few months either side to price that in.

Interesting idea, the multi-faceted nature of bitcoin and variety of target markets makes this possible.

Yes it remains valid. It is also, imo, a great unused feature of bitcoin. They are much like a signed cheque (but not yet cashed or deposited).

Autotools chain (autoconf, automake and libtool, etc) is only way to go for cross-compilation and packaging s/ware across all platforms, it's only system that has the needed flexibility.

The only HF will likely be the last one so the implemented blocksize increase algorithm needs to be "forever" ... i.e. well beyond the foreseeable future. In this context, the 'excuse' you seek for not increasing the blocksize is "the technology does not currently exist".

These are some poignant observations.
I have long wondered about the loss of economic growth and wealth incurred by introducing bureaucratically motivated transaction costs. Things like AML/KYC costs, maximum cash transactions sizes, elimination of bearer bonds/stocks, tax compliance costs, etc, etc. It seems likely these bureaucratic introduced costs into transaction chains could be having a material effect on reducing GDP in even 'advanced' countries. I.e. they are regressive macro-economic actions, maybe even seriously so.

Was wondering why a Secret Service agent was involved in what seems like a local law enforcement action?
Who is he? Is he working for the US Treasury? Why is he posing as a criminal selling stolen credit card numbers? Are those credit card numbers actually stolen? Did he steal them?

@_date: 2017-07-27 10:11:01
The Federal Reserve is a public/private partnership with the major banks and much of its funding goes directly to those banks, not US Treasury bonds. The Federal Reserve Act 1913 specifically provides a remedy for any 'elastic money' issued by the Fed in violation of the Constitution, redemption of Federal Reserve debt notes for 'lawful money' which can only be issued by the US Treasury Department.

These two agents were just using this poor guy to get themselves up to speed on bitcoin and create a name for themselves most likely. Hope they get their stupid arses cracked and the departments get sued ...

.... to attract a member of the opposite sex for possible procreation is the most likely answer.
Prospective mates are attracted to displays of wealth, talents and competency since it is more likely to ensure any subsequent offspring will be well provided for.
