Ah, that makes sense now.  Thanks for the explanation.  Obviously, I found it a little confusing.  Maybe it would make sense to display that information differently since it's really just a status indicator.  Or maybe I'm just slow.

Hey we should throw some kind of party.  This is at least the 15th [Year of Linux!](  One more and she's legal in some places...

Please figure this out!  I spend 8-10 hours a week on a trainer for free right now...
Seriously, I remember seeing an article a couple of years ago about a prison somewhere that allowed inmates to offset their sentence somehow by generating electricity on trainers.  Surely a bunch of crypto geeks could come up with something.

You have to post in the newbies forum and then wait 4 hours or something like that.  There's a sticky there.

My mac was missing quite a few python modules when I did this yesterday.  Looking at my history I installed ecdsa, slowaes, tlslite, qrcode, trezor (which needed cython, I think?).  Several of these weren't in macports and slowaes wasn't in pip.

You have to back it up somehow.  You can do worse than pushing an encrypted file to dropbox.  I'm not comfortable with that for a main wallet but for a day-to-day wallet then why not.
The time machine option kind of confuses me, though.  Time machine is already backing up the whole machine.

Scroll past the 'online' part and click on a city and you'll find people selling bitcoins in person for euros.

Just so you know the last transaction I sent with no fee took 2 or 3 days to get in a block

bitcoin-qt isn't deterministic so new addresses generated after you enabled encryption should be safe.  Personally, I'd still create a brand new wallet anyway and transfer my coins.  
Maybe now is a good time to consider moving your wallet to an offline armory or electrum setup.

He chimed in yesterday giving this app his blessing.  Said they reviewed the code and were happy with it.

They probably don't need to maintain it. I suspect this just became a community project.

No one is buying this dude. The backdating is the same kind of underhanded shadiness we expect from Chinese copycats.

It could be a new bank account opened using a stolen identity. The attacker has to front the cash for the initial coinbase purchase but no one else knows that account exists.

Oh please. No one was posting to websites in 1994. We bitched about things on irc, usenet, and sometimes even aol chat rooms.

Schwab isn't really an online bank.  They have a few [branches](  Lots of banks have phone apps you can deposit checks with and some will let you use a scanner.  Snail mail is usually an option, too.  
Gotta watch the limits though.  I can only deposit $1k with schwab's phone app but a credit union I use will let me deposit $10k with a scanner or $20k with their phone app.

I'm sure it doesn't actually help, but just so you know, people run full bitcoind nodes on raspberry pis that you can get for $30 or so.

This is no different than that effort to make homeless people wear wireless access points. It is not ok.

If someone has your private key they have the right to spend your bitcoins.  That password you have to enter is just because your client encrypts your private key to store it.

It's part of American football. The goalposts stand in the end zone and one way to score points is to kick the ball through them. It's roughly analogous to a soccer (futbol?) net. In conversation it's used to mean the target or objective, I suppose. 
So, you originally said something like 'how many people can just press a button to change pools' and when someone else said its built into some things you asked how many people would notice. The objective changed from switching pools to noticing there's a problem. To restate his metaphor, you moved the goalposts.
