@_date: 2014-11-12 01:35:46
The idea of giving 100 dollars in bit coins makes a lot of sense. MIT wants the bit coin market to spread and among its undergraduate community is simply genius. Lots of smart as hell students who will use it for useful stuff :)
@_date: 2014-11-12 01:38:56
hmm i think i might keep some online because that way my slow ass internet dosent have to sync each time :)
@_date: 2014-11-12 04:09:39

If you hold your breath long enough you die :(
@_date: 2014-11-12 05:04:15
guess I'm not cool enough to be a gentlemen because i am just confused
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:46:45

@_date: 2014-11-12 05:38:20
being a wife beater is not funny at all
Takes gentlemen badge away
@_date: 2014-11-12 04:30:10

Yeah a lot of markets got shut down recently. Some flaw in TOR or?
@_date: 2014-11-12 05:48:24
@_date: 2014-11-12 02:58:01
omg your the best
literally by replying to your comment somehow it thought i was gonna tip it very confused had to cancel a 1 dollar 50 cent tip because i am not sure what i said to do that
@_date: 2014-11-12 13:07:10
haha true that
@_date: 2014-11-12 12:56:58
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:10:45
to many rich tippers
@_date: 2014-11-12 02:55:38
Hmm i mean buy low sell high. Honestly if the bit coin drops under 300 maybe purchase one wait for it to go to the 350-400 range make a quick profit. If you have the money to invest its profitable
@_date: 2014-11-12 13:06:58
i am gentlemen
@_date: 2014-11-12 02:07:29
currently looking at and really don't want to be a moocher so I'm hoping to give back when i have enough :)
@_date: 2014-11-12 04:26:01
what about paper wallets?
@_date: 2014-11-12 05:23:48

@_date: 2014-11-12 01:56:02

and why the negative votes :(
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:30:50
@_date: 2014-11-13 21:10:49
Curious what are all your opinions on the matter
@_date: 2014-11-12 03:46:44
DO NOT PANIC BUY
DO NOT PANIC SELL
Hmm have you traded with alt coins as well or just btc 
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:13:22
yeah not a lot of big tippers :(
@_date: 2014-11-12 05:13:28
@_date: 2014-11-14 01:51:53
yeah but the most was like .50 cent :(
@_date: 2014-11-12 01:55:50

I think bitcoin can change the world because it has technology behind it. The bill is "out dated" with the current surplus of technology and people wanting to be annoymous.
