What are you using for bitcoin price? Your price is about 1000€ above what Gdax displays and it gives me weird get-rich-quick ideas.

You can use google translator for entire article, here are more interesting parts translated by human:
# What is opinion of Czech National Bank (ČNB) towards cryptocurency regullation attempts of some countries? For example, European Union tries to bind exchances under money-laundering directive. What's ČNB's stand on this issue?
We believe that best is to let everyone to try whatever they want, but without any guarantees of state actions in case when something goes wrong. **Don't help, don't protect, don't hold hands.** But rules about exaction of money-laundering restrictions, which are in authority of Office of finnance analysis (Finanční analytický úřad) and rules about Bitcoin regulations are political decissions, only partially related to Central Bank. After all, money-laundering rules are already applied to Bitcoin.
I can say for myself that in European talks about cryptocurency topics, which are held and will be held for long time, we, unlike our colleges from Greece and Italy, will surelly stand on side of those, who are saying no to regulation. We are not trying to create some prescriptive, detailed rules, as those would be contraproductive in the end. We don't have much to gain by doing so and it could cause people to think bout cryptocurencies in terms of convetional currency, and that's something I'd like to prevent.
# Do you hold same stance towards anonymous cryptocurencies and decentralised markets?
For me, it's general philosophical approach. But we know that Bitcoin is in regulatory trap - more it will be used, more voices will call for creating and extending regulations, both from government and people. Sometimes I say to cryptocurency fans: Either you'll success, and get more and more bind by rules, or you'll fail and remain marginal, existing in legally gray area. Take your choice.
*emphasis by me. Traslated part begins with "Jak se vůbec staví ČNB ke snaze..."*

So, Coinbase not knowing that this is possible is weird, but they really weren't able to fix it on their side...
And they were probably unaware that he has private key for "random" address he used.
