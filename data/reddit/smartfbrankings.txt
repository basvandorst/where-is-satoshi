Bitcoin where users must trust others is far worse than existing systems we have based on trust.


Total network failure won't happen.  It just kicks those users off of using Bitcoin (or relying on a trust model).  You are making a strawman argument.


So you want to build a model based on trust.  Great!  There's a solution for you - PayPal.  Stop trying to make Bitcoin PayPal.


Witness data will now be higher proportions than it was before, meaning you'll see higher than 1.7 MB.  Of course, adoption will take some time.


It's charged at a discount compared to the regular chain data.


They are just obtuse greedy pigs, not a demon.

I think you are missing the more obvious reasoning - they need to show revenue or user growth to get that precious VC money in a new round, or at the very least, survive without it.
The Bitcoin/blockchain VC bubble is gone, and companies are going to have to survive on their own, or show to investors that they are worth throwing more money at.  When you show poor growth metrics and a bubble pops on dumb money being thrown at these companies, you need to buckle down and actually try making a profit rather than just piss money away and some rich clueless idiot refills your coffers.

Well, 0.13 was released, so now it just takes turning on the switch and miners to activate.  What's your hurry?


Nodes don't ensure the difficulty.  If you want to trust central providers, I suggest using PayPal for your ledger.  It will be much cheaper for you in the long run.


At best it's 4MB.  1.7 is based on current usage patterns, which of course will change as the costs change.

Increasing cost isn't done in a vacuum - it's done at the benefit of lowering validation costs.
@_date: 2016-08-27 18:58:40


So you are OK with low-value transactions happening in a more centralized layer with low fees I presume.  With nodes - you price out entire users, not just a few use cases that can move to reasonable alternatives.


Why do you assume all transactions must happen on chain?  The "network" includes multiple layers.


I'm yet to see this, they seem to be all aboard the altcoin bandwagon and are interested in division and splits and potential profits than any kind of increasing the network effect.
The PayPal quote is direct from Ver.  There is a way to turn it into it - you make it so only big businesses run nodes, there are very few miners, then you end up with those entities getting heavily regulated, much like PayPal was.  Ver directly said he found that risk acceptable, as long as it meant more adoption (e.g. making him rich).


Not advocating forks is a good way to show you are against division.

Do you understand how Bitcoin's security model works?  Nodes you don't control don't secure Bitcoin.  Are you confusing miners with nodes?


I make no predictions about what will happen, other than you are more likely to see things that are cheaper in the future. 


If you sell steak and chicken for $1/lb, and change the price of chicken to $.25/lb, I'd expect the proportion of chicken to steak purchased to move toward more chicken.


Who said majority is priced out?  The biggest use case for Bitcoin is speculation and black markets, and is not even close to priced out.


Not sure what "it" is, but a change in the cost of witness data *is* that change.


Both will sell their soul in hopes of making a dollar.  Ver has repeatedly done so, and Voorhees is a full-time shitcoin pumper now.

I've attacked the message plenty.  Roger's message is that he's OK with turning into PayPal if it makes him rich (aka Bitcoin's price goes way up).  He's stated it.  Voorhees owns a business that soley exists to shill shitcoins.  There's no messenger attack.

Payment channels were only useful in a single direction in the past.  They also were subject to malleability.  Also in the past, fees were trivial.  There were use cases where they didn't make sense.
They still don't make sense in micro-transaction commerce for the most part.  Pre-buying $5 worth of video content and having that ledger maintained by Streamium is not really a huge downside compared to paying by the second.  At worst, you are out a small amount of money.
Now imagine rather than depositing at an exchange and leaving huge amounts of coins there, you simply had a channel between them.  You could deposit only when you were executing a trade, and withdrawal immediately such that they could not steal your funds.  Only your fiat is tied up.  This is a far better system and actually solves a real problem.  This wasn't possible in the past because of the bi-directional channel issue, the low fees already present, and malleability.
I don't expect it to be super widely used for some time as well - Bitcoin as payments is still a ways off from being useful.  It needs to solve problems that are not solvable today, or wait until there is wider adoption of Bitcoin as a store of value.

LN will make sense when people will need to conduct business with many different people.  I see it evolving with time.  But right now, the number of participants in the ecosystem are small enough, and the ones handling coins are even smaller, such that it won't be super common, at least until a larger scale adoption happens.

Malleability had to have workarounds but you always were in a spot where you were vulnerable to having funds held hostage by the other party without recourse.  Bidirectional was only possible once CLTV came about, and that had fixed time limits.  It's pretty new to have this in great shape.


Obviously having a network between exchanges is better than a single one, but still better than what we have today.  Anywhere where you need to have a large amount of money available quickly but don't want to have a custodian of the money works well.


What I mean is solve real world problems in unique ways that give a huge advantage, not just "but with the Bitcoin!" applications.  You have to look at Bitcoin's distinguishing characteristics - stable money, censorship resistance, irrevocability.  So places that are ripe with fraud and revocation of funds are a great place to start.  Online gambling has huge fraud rates and this helps a ton.  It also needs censorship resistance, as the banking system in the US is the bottleneck whenever governments want to thwart it.  Money works in places where they have little to no other options than terrible local currencies.  Being able to buy electricity in China and use that to take capital out of China through Bitcoins is a great example of a huge use case that previously doesn't really exist.
As for the shops accepting Bitcoin - it's really not solving any kind of novel problem.  Payment networks exist, and are superior to Bitcoin, and will be for a long time, especially in person.  If I am trying to do business with someone in a country where it's difficult to send funds, it's a different story.

The electricity market (at least here) has wholesalers bid every x minutes from providers.  The retail price to consumers varies, but is more reliable and fixed.  Sometimes retail electricity sellers will give discounts for certain times of day or charge fixed amounts, but the system works well.  Bitcoin is incredibly similar, except that it is very early on and we are all buying wholesale.

Don't see how it's a micropayment channel - everything is on-chain.
ShapeShift isn't an exchange, it's just a retailer that's selling inventory (and buying it themselves). It's the equivalent of a currency changer at an airport.
Erik certainly is underestimate the risk to users (user funds are not at risk!).  There's always risk that ShapeShift is simply unable to pay out to funds sent to them at any point.  But they reduced one level of risk by not holding customer funds any longer than needed, which is still a bit better.
When there is unsure demand, you build the simplest model possible, then if it's proven, you can enhance it.  There was no reason to know if this would even be something useful, and if it warranted building a fully secure system.  So build a less secure version, see if demand is there, and improve upon it (or pave the way for someone else to).

There's a tradeoff between security and usability.  As a user, you can manage your risk with something like this by only trading small amounts at a time.  That mitigation easily limits your risk, and you have the convenience of not having to wait for an order to be ready.  That small downside of risk is the price people pay for that convenience.  Those who want ultimate security for large trades can set up atomic swaps with trading partners with real security.

No, it's just not delivering what it's promising.  It's nothing more than running a WordPress site on your own box.

Timeouts are a thing of the past with CSV, and at worst you have a delay getting your funds back (user-configurable though).
Routing payments is just a more sophisticated version of the payment channel idea.  However, you might not be dealing with known entities, who might be unreliable in routing, which can make the whole system useless.  If you are routing funds directly to the receiver, chances are they will cooperate at a higher rate.

I don't think we should be doing this exclusively for miner revenue.  Miners can soft-fork a limit if it maximized revenue if it was something they wanted to do, so it's not really important.


The problem is you are assuming the conclusion.  Whether or not blocks are full shouldn't really matter.  If we can handle bigger blocks without giving up other things, then do it, if not, we cannot, even if blocks are full.  We have a fee system, we have a pricing system, and we have a mechanism for allowing those fees to change over time.  Full blocks are not a crisis.  Yes, it sucks for people who want to send free transactions, but it sucked for anyone who wanted to homestead when all the land was claimed.  Times change.
Second of all, we are getting a doubling with SW, in a much faster time frame than a hard fork could be safely deployed.


Most people think about this backwards.  These people have worked on Bitcoin for quite some time and know its limitations.  They have put huge efforts in optimizing things to keep us going where we are today.  They see that the limit is being reached where we don't have any more magic bullets.  They see how the system *can* safely scale or improve.  So they form a company around this.  But they open source it as well, and others are working on it.  In fact, LN was first proposed by non BS employees and after BS was created.  The employees have an incentive structure tied heavily toward the future value of Bitcoins (far more than others).  Yet other companies, who also have clear conflicts of interest like Coinbase, are given free passes on this.  Companies that have done NOTHING to actually improve Bitcoin, NOTHING to actually scale, other than threaten to split the community into two to appease their investors who likely will lose their ass in the company soon.

I never said we would get large blocks.  But we would get large blocks as soon as it gives any miner an advantage (more fees/slower propagation/etc...).
There is plenty of empirical evidence of it - you can look at orphan rates and consolidation of mining pools.  If you disagree, I'm curious what would actually be evidence that could convince you.
I figured it was Peter R's disproven talk before I even clicked it.  See my post earlier about mining on Mars.  It's completely bogus built on numerous bad assumptions.  He is a charlatan and a liar.  He had two people point out the flaws and continued to ignore them and publish.
Whether it needs or not is entirely subjective.  I haven't seen any evidence it *needs* to for anything other than ensuring that no one ever pays transaction fees that are more than a small amount or that would incentivize wallet software to be written properly.

Yes, tracking users flags is completely useless as there is no way to uniquely identify nodes and provides very little incentives to actually be correct.  For example, as a miner I could kick off 1000 notes faking support for 10MB, some miners might see that as a signal to mine those blocks, then I reject them anyway and the miner gets screwed.

A single or double in the context of Bitcoin is say Bitcoin continues to grow, maybe at a rate of 10-20% per year.  In terms of a business in the early stage, it might be 25-50% YoY Annual Growth without taking on debt and remaining profitable.  All boring things for SV VC.
And no, the goal is not to "drive up fees".  The goal is to make sure Bitcoin stays censorship resistant sound money that does not rely on trusting third parties.
Core developers should be focused on protecting that core ethos and not appeasing "big investors" who will sacrifice any of those properties at the first chance to smell an exit.
I'll make a bet now on it- pretty much all of these VC-funded (&gt; $20M) Bitcoin Companies will pivot into the non-Bitcoin space or go under.  Coinbase will become a shitty PayPal, BitPay will probably go under, 21inc will do god knows what.
The point is that they aren't interested in a conservative growth of Bitcoin or Bitcoin users.  They just want moon or bust.  If it destroys the whole project, who cares, they took their shot and failed.

They are not reversing transactions.  They are orphaning blocks (and presumably including those transactions).
These miners wouldn't try to do it by surprise, they could coordinate it, and even activate in sync.  Miners would do this to increase their revenue by reducing supply.  This is cartel 101, and is super easy.  Except they can actually punish defectors, unlike other cartels.

Miners do not "process" transactions either by that definition either.  And nodes do not validate transactions, but validate blocks.


Really?  You must have missed BIP101 or Bitcoin Unlimited.
A hard drive is not sufficient.  You need to talk about network traffic, CPU usage (right now a bottleneck) for validation.
Yes, SegWit gives that increase, which is why increasing the limit to 2MB with SegWit is a bad idea.


I'd prefer not to have the bump but I'll accept it if we get malleability killed.

We can toy with parameters but all it does is change the extent of the same effect.  It doesn't play out differently in the result (mars at an advantage greater than hash rate).  This is not intended to show extent or magnitude but sign.  So long as delay&gt; 0 and hashpower &gt; 50%, the effect is the same.  You have it backwards, China having its blocks delayed gives them an edge with the majority of hash power.

@_date: 2015-12-14 14:56:05
Having a 75% threshold is not incompatible and signaling could actually encourage it.  A miner is not going to waste effort unless he is certain he won't be on a bad chain, and this is pretty much impossible without signaling.
However, making an incompatible soft fork could very well let both solutions exist, letting those who care about different value propositions to pick a different chain.  Those who value cheap transactions above all else can go to a Gigachain and those who value anti-censorship and being able to validate their own transactions can stick to a smaller chain.
It's too bad the XT crowd couldn't just wait for sidechains so that we could all use the same currency and move it back and forth as needed.

For the sake of simplicity, just assume every Bitcoin full node is a lightning node too.  When you connect to someone, you form a channel with them.  You don't even have to be in constant communication - you can get offline, come back the next day, whatever.
Now if you want to send money to Best Buy, in a well connected network, there would be many paths to them!  You might be connected to 8 peers, each connected to 8, and eventually someone is connected to Best Buy (Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, right?).  So you are able to say "route X funds to Best Buy).  Your software finds a path (or several paths), and starts pushing the money along the way.  The next node pushes until it makes it to Best Buy.  Suppose you sent from A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;Best Buy.  A sends to B, B sends to C, C sends to D, D sends to Best Buy.  The beauty of it is, B can't just take your payment.  He can only get paid if he pays C.  And C can only get paid if he proves he paid B.  And D can only get paid if he can prove he gets paid by C, and Best Buy can only get paid when A releases the funds to start it and Best Buy let's him know that it's all ready to go through.
Potentially very decentralized.  Economic incentives for operating a node, keeping keys online, and so forth could make it more hub-spokeish, but it's entirely technically feasible to run decentralized.

@_date: 2015-12-22 15:54:06
You are validating, but not everything.  There are very few limited attacks that can take place on an upupgraded node.  Mining nodes have the most to lose, and do need to upgrade, but a check is in place that makes sure 95% have upgraded, so it's not a concern.
The level of safety of an unupgraded node that relies on confirmations is incredibly high after a soft fork.  Furthermore, there's nothing that can be done to prevent soft forks, so arguing about it is moot.
@_date: 2015-12-22 18:04:00
"rely on", no, only SPV users rely on it.  The rest verify it.
MIners are *not* the ultimate source unless you blindly follow longest chains, like SPV users do.

That may have been true in the days of decentralized mining rigs, but the pools are quite equivalent to miners now with large mining operations.
@_date: 2015-12-29 02:15:27
This is untrue, BIP101 would activate with a mere ~70% of miners signalling intent to mine, which is far from any kinds of consensus, and a few false votes and a lucky stream leave it as a dangerous split where there are two forks for a long period of time (hopefully until everyone returns to the old rules and orphan those who disrupted things).
But it does have no change of being adopted, fortunately miners are not stupid.
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:37:31
Why would a large business do this with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-12-07 19:18:19
This scales by allowing layers to develop where they need to to *actually* scale Bitcoin.  Blockchains do not scale linearly, which is a major issue.  This solves the issue in a way that merely changing the block size does not.  I'd prefer the discounting of witness data didn't occur, but if that's what it takes to get malleability solved, I'll take it.

Open Transactions is a ledger but does not use blockchains internally.  But you could have an asset that is on a blockchain that could be locked with a multi-signature scheme in which the instruments of OT could be used (cash, checks, etc...).  You could withdrawal by proving you owned the assets and the multi-signature parties would sign a transaction to withdrawal your Bitcoins.
It is a great complimentary technology to Bitcoin, and far superior to spamming the blockchain with all Tunisian transactions.

No slip.
Blocks filling up is irrelevant to whether the size is technically feasible or not.


Deliberately, yes.  But not totally unnecessarily.  It is a protection against flooding of blocks making it more costly to operate a node and provide a bigger advantage for large miners.
Why throttle the system?  The same way you put a governor on an engine and not let it the engine blow up by overheating.

The consensus rules are the most "centralized" part - it's the part we all must agree on.  You are free to use other consensus rules if you can find other people who prefer to use those.
This will all become moot with sidechains - people can use the same currency to follow whatever rules they want for their use cases, and if they need to switch back, they can.
@_date: 2015-12-24 20:15:57
You are defining centralized nodes in a different manner.  Is BitPay's Bitcoin node(s) centralized because they might connect to a lot of people?  Or that a lot of people send transactions to them?
The economics will dictate the makeup of the network, but there is no technical requirement for a hub-and-spoke system, where very few routes exist.


The amount just needs to cover a small amount of business needed.  Remember, Target, right now, will not get paid for quite some time after a CC purchase.  So they already are floating quite a lot, this will be nothing for them.
So let's say Target sets up a LN account for $100,000 spread across many nodes.  Say they are well connected and connect to 100 users for $1000 each.  Someone checks out and buys $100 worth.  That user has a route where they pay $100 to Target.  Target now has a balance of $100,100.  Say that 100 users each push through, and it happens to go through each of their connections.  So each node connected has a $900 of their funds in the Target Channel (and +$100 balance on some other connection).  Target now has $110,000.  They pay their employees their wages for the day.  Say they have $9000 in wages to pay in Bitcoin.  They now push back in the other direction through those same nodes (who push to the employee's accounts).  So they don't need to maintain any kind of huge balance, they simply push it out as needed, no different than Target maintaining a bank account with reserves to pay payroll, pay suppliers.
An equal payment, afaik, is not required, up front.  Target could, if it found a willing node, open a channel where they have very little money deposited, and the other side perhaps bigger.  A node connected to target would be willing to do this because it would expect a large volume of business to happen and could make fees.  So the nodes put up money, connect to target, then push as sales are made.  Then, target pushes back to pay bills or sell coins on Coinbase or pay wages.
The concept of "$200 into their Starbucks LN Channel" does not make sense.  The channels are for use across any participant in the LN.  You don't lock it in with a single entity.  That concept has existed for some time (payment channels).  A payment channel does not require two directions, and Starbucks would not need to put anything up front since it is not needed to pay customers.  They could, however, open payment channels with suppliers and workers, if they wanted to.  This concept is obsoleted by LN, where you don't have to connect directly to whoever you wish to interact with.

Anything can be ignored, even priority transactions, which is why this is a policy change, not consensus change.
Yes, it is possible that all miners agree to never process a certain transaction even when they have room.  But fees could be part of it, maybe they don't like a specific transaction format (soft-forks do this all the time!).
You may have trouble getting other nodes to pass on your zero-fee transactions, but such is true of any potential transaction.

It depends on the size of the transactions and what percentage is witness data.  The 7 tx/s was based on the smallest reasonable transaction possible.  Multisig transactions would take up more space, so you could have fewer than 7 tx/s for those.  But now a multisig transaction would take up the same space as single sig (or close to it), and then the signatures take up the extra space.
@_date: 2015-12-17 00:30:12
The reward size meaning the amount awarded over time.  If the price goes up or down too much (due to too many or too few miners selling!), that's an economic event.  According to Jeff's logic, we need a central committee to address that by changing the coin release schedule to make sure things don't change too much, because users need to be protected through central decision making.  Why fees are relevant but inflation/deflation aren't is beyond me.

Trying to understand why that is the case - producing a valid header but invalid block is expensive.  If you can create a valid header, you are basically giving up a subsidy you would have found mining as a way to attack a subset of miners.  I haven't thought through the details sufficiently to rule out this attack, but I haven't seen how it could be impacted other than someone who wants to throw a lot of money to cause a small disruption for a few miners.
Rogue miners in a pool who withhold solutions would be a bigger threat from what I've seen.

Why must a currency be stable in value?  I'd rather have one that keeps increasing in value!


Complete economic myth.  Computers get faster, tvs get better, every year.  The same dollar you spend on electronics could buy you much more in a following year.  Yet you buy those things now.  People have time preferences for wanting something now rather than later, so even an increasing value of currency does not deter spending.  It deters frivolous spending.

Great!  You did seem more educated than the typical "BIG BLOCKS NOW!" crowd.


Oh, back to ignorance again.  This is not very complex or risky.  It's been rolled out in test systems for quite some time as well.
Of course, Seg Wit's main intent is not to make the blocksize bigger.  That's one effect it has, but wasn't the motivating purpose for it.


Not really.  Only if they care about it.


Nah, they are full of hot air and end up compromising anyway (which is why the debt limit constant increases is identical to this type of "compromise").
I am unwilling to sacrifice the things that make Bitcoin work so that some freeloaders can get free transactions.  Sorry.


We are.  Bitcoin has strengths and weaknesses (something you don't get if you get your information from Andreas Antonopolous videos or from reading If you were trying to use a hammer to put a screw into a piece of wood, I'd suggest using a screwdriver.  It doesn't mean hammers are no good, they just aren't good *at that job*.  Those that want free instant transactions should *not* use Bitcoin.  It's not good at that job, and will *never* be able to do better than alternatives.  It's like trying to make a car that floats on water and flies.  I'd rather use a boat when I need to travel on water, and a plane when I need to fly.


Whether or not an alternative exists is irrelevant.  You don't strap rockets onto cars because planes haven't been invented yet.  There is no crisis.  The worst that happens is fees go up a bit, and some silly use cases disappear.  Oh no! 


Such alternatives exist.  They work much better than Bitcoin (except when you need Bitcoin's fundamental properties).  So go use them!  It's OK!  Just because sometimes I drive doesn't mean I hate planes and boats.


You keep making this argument that I am not making.  Fee markets exist to help the public good of the blockchain exist for all to use, not so miners can make money.  Miners already can constrain the blocks if they wanted to, so it doesn't exist for them.

I'll dig it up, it's in my history (and I shamelessly stole it from someone else, probably I don't have time to write it again or find it (I'll get to it later if needed), but the basis of the analogy is imagine post-colonization of Mars, where Mars is 22 minutes away through communication from Earth.  Put 75% of miners on Mars and 25% on Earth.  When miners on Mars find a block, they send it to Earth and it arrives 22 minutes later.  Miners on Earth do the same.
If there was a wormhole to communicate instantly and everyone just mining on first blocks seen, you'd expect 75% of blocks found on Mars, 25% on Earth.  Without the wormhole, what % would you expect to be found on Mars vs. Earth?  You have said that being stuck behind a large delay makes you disadvantaged, so that would mean &gt;25% from Earth.

They have advantages now, and are just exploiting it, but it could get a lot worse.  If that ship is sailed, then Bitcoin is already dead, unless we fix it.
And IBLT-like propagation - the problem is this is horribly broken and miners can easily ignore it when it's in their interest.  


Unfortunately, there really is no way of knowing.  I know you desperately want this to be true.  But hope is not a plan.  Interest does nothing if the plan is broken.  A reasonable approach of taking the minimum changes to minimize risk is so much preferable when there *are* problems, and waiting until there actually are real problems instead of speculation is another good approach.


Yes.  Now decrease the number of nodes running, and how much more likely is it that you connect to one honest node?

Anyone can run an OT server, issue currencies of their choosing, and so forth.  Did I use it for a transfer of value? No.  Currencies require multiple parties to agree to its value.
Now, a Bitcoin-multi-sig federated server with transactions happening with OT is not something that is working right now, but I'm pretty sure this is something that a group is working on right now with a company for this exact purpose.  Bitcoin, the currency, is not limited by 3 transactions per second, just settlement on the blockchain.

Why is block 300,001B invalid?  Both originate from the same block (300,000, which is valid in Hearncoin).  Both are equally valid at that point in time.  Block 300,001 follows Hearncoin rules.  It follows Hearncoin's chain.  It has the right difficulty.

The incentive to cheat goes up a lot when no one is able to keep you in check, vs. a system where someone could potentially audit you at any point.
Which is why # of nodes is far less of an important measure compared to cost of running a node (even if temporarily) and likelihood of that node being attacked (running a full node that can be easily sybil attacked for example).

I think those are all positive steps with Factom!  Centralization vs. decentralization is all about trade-offs and use cases.  In a case where I need to trust anyway, centralization isn't that bad (if you can have a way that they cannot forge things, that's good enough).  But what is nice, is your application works just fine without spamming the blockchain.  In the end, your application is about creating unforgeable records that are sequenced. 
Factom is a bit parasitic on Bitcoin - but at least the damage is minimized.  Bitcoin pays a small price (1 small tx every 10 minutes) for it, so it's not a huge deal.
I agree you are acting against the interests of Factom, and that you have Bitcoin's interests in your intent.  I don't think you are acting out of ill intent and likely not even in opposition with values I have.
I am mostly just against the argument that all these companies need something, therefore we ought to significantly change/break Bitcoin to support them.  If it's in the interest of *users* of Bitcoin, that is the rationale.  These companies exist to serve us, not the other way around.  Their time horizon is different than many of the users (I'll HODL far longer than any of their runways), so they should not speak for me.  Each of these businesses, if they truly believe in Bitcoin, should lock up a significant part of funding in a time-locked transaction on the blockchain to show their interests align.  I'll take them seriously at that point.
@_date: 2015-06-24 17:34:52


No.  Can we just stop assuming the intent of any opposition is to destroy Bitcoin?  We might disagree in what gives it value, but that doesn't mean someone has ill intent.
Yes, it's complex.  Costs increase, maybe value increases.  Maybe it doesn't.  It's speculative, but we at least look at what effect it has.


Speculation.  We at least would know what happens when blocks fill up, how fee markets develop, how off-chain transactions develop.  Would this be the ultra-growth VC-like drive for adoption?  Probably not, but we solve problems earlier and then grow.


Not sure I get this.  If there's centralization, those who are biggest and most centralized benefit.  You are acting like that's a positive.


Past performance does not guarantee future results.  


It's not purely number of nodes, it's ease of running a node on demand as well, and cost of being sybil attacked.  These are serious concerns.
I'd rather take extra care of decentralization (the only key distinguishing feature of Bitcoin compared to alternatives) at the expense of growth, than throw the baby out with the bathwater.  If we sacrifice decentralization seeking growth, Bitcoin will just lose to systems optimized for centralization.  But hey, we might have a short term ride to dump our Bitcoins that we are bagholders for!

That's a big part, but usability definitely improves.  Look at cars you had to turn a crank on to start.  They were horribly unsafe, weren't that fast, inefficient beasts.  Look at computing, even over the last 20 years and how much more usable things come.  That is the key to mainstream adoption.
Kids are willing to try things, and that's what starts the bleeding edge of technology.  If you don't know anything, then the cost of learning is not high, compared to when you already know something, learning something new is a bigger investment since you can already do what you want with what you already know.  I used to think it was because old people were dumb or something, but getting older myself and seeing my kids pick up things so fast, I definitely can see where it's coming from.

Oh I agree entirely.  I've been around a while, when Mt. Gox was the only game in town and had just gotten started and you had to jump through 3 layers to get coins.  Then you had to run a full node to have a wallet, and the default wallet sucked big time.
We still have a tremendous way to go for mainstream adoption, but it's worlds better.  Just don't expect it to come overnight.
@_date: 2015-12-29 17:10:35
Yes, that's more accurate, sorry for the confusion!
It's a common pool resource, not public good.


They aren't charged fixed rates (and such a process would be impossible, since rebates are always possible).  They are charged whatever a miner feels like (could be 0, could be a large amount).  Is the cost low enough?  Maybe, but that depends on block size and miners incentives.  There are some block sizes and costs that make this completely untenable.  This limit was in place to make sure such a situation didn't get out of hand - a safety rail.  Without it, it may be safe if miner incentives line up properly with user incentives, but not necessarily.


It's not just space it's transfer of data as well.  Upload speeds are most constrained and are essential to avoid sybill attacks.  Verification using CPU also is a concern, it's the biggest bottleneck in synching right now.


CT does require more disk space (although I think this mostly would go in witness data IIRC, which is likely a motivation for SW).  RBF takes up no extra disk space.  Pegs are only interesting if you need them, and the SPV proof would be in the witness data again, which can easily be pruned after verification (though still a concern!).  I don't discriminate in what data could be stored, as long as the total data is restricted properly, and prices can dictate this.
This isn't a black and white issue - at every increase in cost, some nodes get knocked off the network (either the benefit isn't worth the cost, or it isn't even possible to keep up).  Some of this must be acceptable (oh no, someone on a 56k modem cannot keep up anymore), but clearly there is an upper bound where the dynamics change greatly.  We need to approach it with caution and err on the side of being conservative.  Transactions are like goldfish- they'll grow to the size of their tank as there are near unlimited use cases for stuffing data in a hugely replicated database and pricing is the only mechanism that can limit this.  Keeping out non-Bitcoin use that does not add value to Bitcoin is preferable.  If someone wants to crete a massive data store, applications can be tailored for that without destroying Bitcoin.

How can you tell the good from the bad?  Look at the % of holdings of the owners in Bitcoin vs. the companies.  The higher % of Bitcoin ownership, the better, as their interests are more closely aligned with Bitcoin users.  It's not 100%, but that works.
Secondly, look at how their business model is intended to work.  If it's business model is dependent on a centralized Bitcoin layer 0, where users depend on them, it's going to be bad.  If they depend on serving above that layer, it's good.  FWIW, I'd consider Factom the business to be in that category, and a good thing for not fucking up Bitcoin with spam of land titles!

He brought it up as a worst case scenario in case he cannot get miners on board.  You are right, that's the case, where miners veto his change.
I just showed you that the small chain needs only 50%+1 of the hashing power (cumulatively since the fork) and it effectively 51% attacks the big chain.  I don't think miners even consider switching unless they expect 80-90% of miners to switch with them.

Ok, so wallet companies.  Pretty much all which exist without a business plan other than begging for money (or in the most evil cases, partnering with the government to "stop crime" through tracking).  The one's I've seen attempt to make money do so from skimming some of transactions.  Of course their interests will only be in increasing number of transactions!  That's the only way they stay in business!  So it's silly to use their opinion as anything useful as what's good for Bitcoin.
Tainted coins can come in many forms, which could be registering who you are for every transaction, and they can make sure you pay taxes on it.
Not surprised they would be in favor of something that gives them numerous tools (combined with deanoymonization tools like Coinbase), that could link things together for them very easily.

There are a lot of spoiled users who are used to free transactions and cannot spare a nickel to pay them.
Yes, people paid transactions they probably didn't need to pay, and the relaying of blocks had limits (that were overridable!) for what transactions could be set.  Transaction fees have always been to the point of being virtually free (with small enough values to prevent a free spam attack).
Yes, 300% increase, if you have the urgency to get it in the next block.  Still an incredible value.
Yes, this cap did not always exist.  If you bought when the cap didn't exist, I'll have some sympathy for you.  No, there is no clear intention to remove it.  There never has been other than imagined in the heads of those who view Bitcoin as a cheaper VISA.

Depends how large, of course.  For any significant scaling, it almost certainly would.  Which is why no one with even the slimmest of technical knowledge believes this is possible (not Gavin, not Jeff, etc...).


So who does in order to maintain the useful properties of Bitcoin?  If you believe the useful properties are different, perhaps you could enumerate them.
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:57:14
No need for subjective censorship.  We've been able to control this through a maximum block size and throw relay limits for fees.

@_date: 2015-12-17 01:55:11
Correct - fee paying.  If the fees were 1 penny for 1 GB, you'd see everyone's personal music collection, porn, etc... uploaded to the blockchain.  Fortunately, that isn't possible and it would make Bitcoin a lot worse if it were happening.
We have things similar - people who freeload with low fee transactions to bounce unwanted nickels around, and now everyone with a validating node bears the cost of it forever.  This is a classic public goods problem.
But at least we are in the Blockstream conspiracy lad.

Perfect, we agree.  Decentralization matters, beyond all else.  And yes, I'm totally fine with not everyone running a node!  I haven't run a node in a while, mostly because benefits &lt; costs.


What if Bitcoin just wasn't well suited for paying for coffees without sacrificing centralization?  Is buying coffees really that useful compared to alternatives?

Why create an economic earthquake?  When is the right time to do so?  I don't think there is a right answer, but my thoughts are you create it as early as feasible.  In the early stages, perhaps it was too early because it would never get started.  You want it to affect the least number of people possible and you want it to happen early on so proper expectations are set.  If anything, we waited too long.
Kicking the can might be the right choice, but not due to the logic Jeff proposes, which is investors made bad decisions and they need to get bailed out based on faulty assumptions.
Like it or not, Bitcoin today is fundamentally a speculative investment more than anything.  There are some places it shines in real world use cases (sex and drugs are the two big places).  I'm not terribly interested in bailing out poor investment choices based on bad assumptions and promises that were never made.

The original code had an "accidental" 32MB limit due to protocol rules (though this wasn't consensus code).
Selfish Mining was not even known when 1MB was added.  It was added as an anti DDOS attack by a malicious miner.
Expecting an increase is not the same as a plan for it.  This is no different than banks making stupid investments expecting to get bailed out, then crying that when they aren't bailed out that their expectations weren't met and now there is chaos.
An economic event like Jeff is proposing is a great way to shake out bad investments, much like letting the banks fail would have been better than bailing them out.

Yeah, Garzik is making some really weird arugments over and over, full of logical fallacies.
I've never heard the wallet provider issues.  More of the objections are about economic change events and other weird things.
As for wallets- I'm not sure what to expect, but does it really matter?  They don't support it, they still work just fine.  Addresses users use will look in the old format and still work.  It just comes down to being able to send to people who want SW, and if so, then they might be able to support it, if not, no big deal.
I'm not sure wallet providers have this huge incentive - it's not like their success is based on customer's transaction fees.  Barely any have any kind of business model at all.

Question for If the price of Bitcoin changes rapidly, that clearly is an Economic Change Event.  So if the price rises a lot, are we obligated to make sure things are proper by changing the mining rate to match this, so the price doesn't change too much?

The last bullet, unfortunately, is a bit trickier.  It's a prisoner's dilemma - miners can't "sacrifice" for the greater good, because someone else just takes advantage short term and hurts them.  However, they could in fact coordinate efforts and punish defectors (such as soft forks to limit block sizes they view as detrimental) in some cases.
I expect miners to work together to do what's best for Bitcoin when possible, but it's far too easy for "cheaters" to exist when there is no penalty for defection.

Sometimes there is a spite element, where you'd rather die than surrender, but centralized powers that have overwhelming forces can profit from war.

I don't think it's necessarily true that the reward needs to be identical, and there are a lot of factors in place that could alter it, such as Bitcoin price.  
For example, if the Bitcoin price doubles by the halving, miners would be making the same $ amount from mining.  It's complex.  In the end game, who knows if it's sustainable, and 100 years into the future has a lot of things that could change, and raising the block limit then would probably be extremely obvious to at least some level to compensate.
I don't agree that there's a  "correct" price for the miners, and it's very possible they are being overcompensated right now compared to needed security (long term), simply because it makes sense to bootstrap the network early and bootstrap currency distribution.
But thanks for at least explaining the number, it at least comes from something logical, rather than a lot of the fear based nonsense that's out there.
The $9 number is interesting - I think it's a great argument for those who argue Bitcoin is a cheap transaction network.  It's very, very costly.  It's paid for through inflation right now, but for Bitcoin to be useful, it needs to be useful in spite of expense.  Otherwise, we could just use a cheaper centralized solution.
Many people have been misled or misunderstood the expense of a decentralized consensus system.  It's very costly.  But IMO it's worth it.  That's why Bitcoin needs to stay unique and focus on where it drives value rather than just copycat every centralized system out there without the benefits of centralization and without the benefits of decentralization.
Bitcoin could be very, very useful even if transactions were $1 each for a ton of use cases.  While it might not be useful for small transactions, it still beats the pants off of a great deal of systems that involve trust and settlement and fraud.  Let's win where we have the advantage instead of trying to compete where we don't have it.

4% is the absolute high end for merchants with any volume.  You are neglecting training costs of accepting Bitcoin, operational costs of maintaining that network as well. 
You are neglecting the fees to acquire Bitcoin, which are in the 1% range as well.  So you are paying extra to use Bitcoin.  Not ot mention I get cash back of at least 1% on my cards.  So I'd have to be willing to pay 2% effectively to benefit the business.  They need to give me a 2% discount for it to be worth it for me, which eats up all of their supposed savings.

Cost of a node is one consideration.  Mining centralization is another concern.

Yes, we need to fix things.  Things get fixed when there is a little pain.  I'd much rather fix things now than fix things at 20x usage.  Even worse, I'd hate to just kick the can down the road again after another increase.
Limiting popularity and providing a market to solve these issues is probably the best thing Bitcoin needs *right now*.  Sure, sucks for all the VC's who want to free-ride off of Bitcoin.  But it just opens the door for another set to move in, fix things, and let us move forward instead of put some duct tape on an issue and consider it solved.

Pure nodes isn't an absolute decentralization measure.  Ease of running a full node helps, although if few nodes exist, it's easier to get sybil attacked, which is one of the dangers of centralization.

Sure I can.  You are asking me to define an arbitrary border between centralization and decentralization.  It's not black and white.




Correct.  Decentralization is a means to an end - censorship resistance and lack of control.


Part of the story.  Bitcoin cannot have transactions without value.  Value is the key part of the equation - it must be money.




I have never made that assumption and even explained exactly that.


Everyone would be vulnerable here.


Yep.  Which is why it's complex.


Disagree, it's complex, but centralization of mining is very easy to measure, for example.  I can see how many pools exist.  That's how many people I need to buy off/threaten with jail to censor transactions to my whims.  Node centralization is harder, but ability to run a node and number of nodes are good metrics to use.


Sending a bunch of transactions doesn't give value, otherwise Dogecoin would be worth a lot more.  What gives value is people who treat it as money, not as a passthrough.


So how do we reconcile competing interests here.  Some miners want big blocks, some want small, some users want big, some want small.   Now what?  What are you actually proposing?  "The market will decide?"
Your solution is to push Bitcoin to the centralization maximum before people quit?

If there is no limit, the fees will trend toward the marginal mining cost of including a transaction.  Chances are this is a pretty small number.  Unless a cartel forms that starts orphaning those who include too small fees, this is what will happen, and it seems like based on current assumptions, this is a small number for fee.

The young are far more likely to do things that are new and (currently) inefficient, just to be at the forefront.  They like to challenge the status quo, even if it means a bit extra work.  They like to build and explore and don't have the artificial limitations age and experience can put on them.  They can see things more cleanly and innocently and without biases, which I think helps with new technology, where older people tend to view technology through a lens of their experiences (email?  We already have faxes!  What good is this?!).  Hell, even I was very reluctant to get a smart phone until just last year - "I already have a computer, what do I need this for?".
But I also think a lot of it comes down to, say starting from scratch, Bitcoin would be easier to use than legacy systems.  But starting from knowing how to use legacy systems and already being integrated with them, the benefits of using Bitcoin are smaller than the learning curve, the older folks won't switch.
@_date: 2015-06-18 00:59:02
You realize that a fork isn't starting from scratch with a new genesis block?  They start from the same point.
To expand on it, say Mike plans his great fork at block 300,000.  The first 299,999 blocks is always the same.  Block 300,000 comes.  One miner finds a block that is .99 MB.  He submits its.  Mike's network and Bitcoin network see this, and say "great, let's use block 300,000!".
No divergence yet.
The next miner comes along and mines block 300,001H and it's 1.1 MB.  Bitcoin rejects this block.  Hearncoin accepts it.
Now another miner comes along and mines a block chained off of 300,000 (the last block in Bitcoin), and it's .98MB.  That's block 300,001B for Bitcoin AND Hearncoin, although there's some ambiguity on Hearncoin on which block will win.  Most miners will mine on the first block they see, but they can choose whatever they want.
Now another miner comes along and mines block 300,002B and it's .99MB.  At this point, clients of Hearncoin see that the original chain is longer and has more work, therefore it MUST be the truth!  So they abandon 300,001H, and accept 300,002B as the true chain.
Miners now start mining on 300,002B no matter what chain.  The same process repeats itself, but let's say 2 blocks are found on Hearncoin first.  So 300,003H and 300,004H exist.  Bitcoin still thinks there are only 300,002 blocks.  A Bitcoin miner now finds 300,003B.  Now, the Bitcoin mining network, if larger in strength, will always win the race against the Hearncoin miners in the long run.  Even if a temporary set of blocks is found, and even if the Hearncoin miners continue to mine on that chain, it will lose, given the current rules.  Eventually, Bitcoin passes it, and it loses.
Even if Hearncoin is 1,000 blocks ahead, say 55% of miners are on Hearncoin and 45% on Bitcoin, and the networks diverge, if a sudden change in value convinces miners to switch back to Bitcoin ( say 10% switch), that means that, eventually, likely in a few weeks, Bitcoin's network will outrun Hearncoin.  Hearncoin clients will now abandon every transaction that occurred since the split, and honor Bitcoin.  All transactions that occurred on Hearncoin and not Bitcoin are unwound, and you have a serious clusterfuck for anyone who used Hearncoin.
Which is why you need checkpoints.

True, until Hearn decided to push even harder when ignored.


There always is a limit.  There is a finite space to store things, finite bandwidth in the world.


This is a bit simplistic.  Mining rigs have a lifetime far less than 4 years now.  So it should already be priced in.


I've made this argument before.  Miners can only be more strict than users preferences.  That still gives them a lot of censorship power.


Very few heating appliances make sense here for using electricity.  It's possible, but it's still a ways off.  Even so, mining rigs like this still need a full node to mine.  If you have 10 million mining toasters and 2 pools, that's a huge danger for centralization.  That's the bigger concern.

There is nothing about the market that will guarantee Bitcoin exists in a decentralized fashion.  It simply changes into something else at that point.  Maybe that's acceptable to you.

Mining rigs themselves don't need a huge amount of bandwidth - the nodes could be located further away.  Mining operations could locate near free/cheap electricity, and put nodes near good bandwidth areas, and just need low latency between the places.
The issue is if changing the parameters gives an edge to larger pools, that's a much bigger issue.
@_date: 2015-06-23 20:52:14
It's a valid concern, certainly, though it's far from a given to work.  Maybe working through such a scenario and how it would impact fees might work out, especially since so much of the cost is borne by one miner, and benefits spread across all.
@_date: 2015-06-21 01:19:26


Sure.  But at that scale, you break decentralization.  Bitcoin without decentralization is terribly inefficient with no upsides compared to centralized alternatives.


Agreed.  But that's kicking the can down the road and you end up with bad behavior for a massively larger number of people.


Agreed, but that's because there is more profit potential and less risk.  I understand your point, grow first, then let everything get shitty, then there's more money to throw at it, but there's also a bigger fall-off.
I'm a fan of fail fast learning.  Learn when we have early adopters tolerant to slightly bad behavior, if it actually is a disaster, we can still act quickly and bump things.


I think we found the biggest crux.  Think about how Bitcoin can be negatively affected by decentralization and what the benefits of decentralization are.  Censoring transactions, whitelists, are something governments would want, and could easily control through centralized mining.  Centralized nodes enable miners to operate dishonestly as well and increases risks of sybil attacks.
3000tps is just not even close to possible with today's  Bitcoin and the infrastructure that exists.  Maybe in 50 years it will be trivial, and by all means go for it.  But, this isn't something to tinker with.  Tinker with it in small, measurable increments rather than going for the 20x increase or 2x every 2 years forever nonsense being proposed.  This very well could have a serious impact on decentralization, which basically is the death of Bitcoin in terms of providing any value at all.  It might not, but let's at least take some baby steps before diving in head first without measuring the depth.

Bitcoin mining is quite monopolistic as cartel behavior and enforcement is very easy to pull off by pools and cheating can be punished through orphaning. 
However, big miners having an edge in larger blocks means their marginal value for including a transaction is lower, thus, they will be able to outcompete small miners increasing centralization.
Maximizing miner revenue not a bad thing to aim for, though should not occur at expense of decentralization.

Unfortunately "needing"  more transaction space does not mean simply increasing it is without consequences.  It is an engineering trade-off.  Need is a very strong word - if the space is not increased, Bitcoin will not fundamentally break, but simply fees will increase to price out the least useful use cases of Bitcoin.  Bram Cohen had a great article on this.  Wallets and nodes need small upgrades (of features that keep getting delayed because "well, no crisis, so why use them!") to better handle being able to cancel/spend transactions with more fees.
Miners themselves are locked up a bit, but much shorter term than you are giving them credit.  Mining rigs go obsolete incredibly fast, so the value of Bitcoin in say 2020 is irrelevant to the value of a rig today.  So that investment is all about maximizing short term gains, which may come at the expense of long term gains.  They also suffer from the tragedy of the commons.  What is good for mining in general may not be good for individual miners.
As for why we are centralized - it's pretty clear, so I'm not sure where you are confused.  Chips are incredibly expensive to develop (your friend the Factom CEO can tell you about how hard that model is!), and if they are profitable to operate, you might as well operate yourself rather than put all the effort into reselling.  So you end up with a very few number of people making chips, then operating them.  Add in the cost of running decentralized mining (running a full node, making sure it's running and not screwed up), which scales better than linerally to expand (economies of scale), add in centralized mining advantages (lower orphan rates), and have it be a commodity (Eligus cannot differentiate itself from F2Pool in the marketplace of finding good hashes), and you have centralized mining.
The only way to counter this IMO is to have mining chips get to a point where they are so cheap to make and manufacture, they simply go to hundreds of operations (all which can have access to cheap power - which is hard to compete against free from Chinese taxpayer subsidies), and centralized mining advantages disappear (possibly changing the protocol to make pool mining unfeasible by making whoever finds the hash capable of stealing the entire reward from a pool.

The block size should be as large as technology allows.  If the limitations of the block size means we need to discover better layers on top, that is what is needed without sacrificing what is good about Bitcoin.  If it allows for larger blocks, then transactions can be cheaper.
Moving off spam from the Blockchain (non-Bitcoin uses) is fine.  It provides no value to Bitcoin.  Users who are interested in such information can be responsible for tracking it, similar to how things like Factom or ChainDB are handling it.

The further you divide a currency, the less valuable it becomes.  Network effect is powerful.
We all win when we work together with money.  However, when there are different goals (those who prefer cheap transactions might prefer ripple or stellar to Bitcoin where those who prefer censorship resistance might prefer Bitcoin), there might be a split.  Ideally, a single currency used with different transaction models and security models would be best.  Sidechains show the greatest amount of promise in this area.

You seem to ignore the real impact to centralization that occurs by increasing orphan rates of Chinese miners.


No one says this is holy or magical.


Every rule that exists in Bitcoin's consensus mechanism could be considered central planning.  We could just have a timestamping application if you'd like, with signed blocks by miners.
@_date: 2015-06-21 20:15:15


This scheme is not mandatory, nor could it be, so miners that have an edge in delaying blocks would simply not use this technique.


*should* be uncontroversial?  Who are you to decide what should or shouldn't be controversial.  It either is or it isn't.  If it isn't, there's little risk.  If it is, there's risk.  Sure, less risk if everyone is already stuck with it than having to keep doing it.  But if going to 2MB is a success and nothing bad happens, there will be very few arguments against a further increase down the line.


I agree, but I don't see any better alternatives.


No, what I'm saying is the cost of operating nodes with higher requirements goes up, which removes incentives to run nodes.  Therefore there are fewer nodes, therefore the number of nodes an attacker needs to run to be successful goes down.  Nodes can only handle so many connections.
Keep in mind the 167KB/s is assuming only a single send of each transaction received, which is far from what will happen, especially with leeching SPV nodes.  That's to maintain a single connection.

Incorrect, there is tons of gold in the core for example.  And there are asteroids and other non-earth sources of gold.


False.  It's still increasing at 2% per year in supply.


Which is why gold can never be as good a money as Bitcoin.  It is the hardest money of all.  No amount of demand can create more Bitcoin.  The most that can happen is a very slight pull of it forward in time.


Another strike against gold.


Intrinsic value doesn't mean shit other than a price floor.  It makes it a *worse* money.  


Why would anyone not just use silver tin instead of gold?


Money that has utility is strictly worse.  Now you are competing with other use cases and mixing value.


Your lack of understanding of money is probably why.  I suggest reading The Bitcoin Standard to improve this lack of understanding.


Bitcoin is not a popularity contest.  It's something that people will have no choice but to adopt.  Retail is the least interesting of adopters, they will be the last to adopt when they have no choice.  There's a reason these large institutions are getting involved now.  It's actually a significant hedge for the wealthy.  


This is a zero sum economy argument.  Bitcoin *adds* wealth by serving a use case - wealth protection and censorship resistant payments.  This *adds* value where it wasn't there before.  Did Apple grow in value because it needed additional suckers to buy its stock, or because it is creating value?


Complete garbage stat.  I could create as many wallets as exist today by spamming dust.  Much of these "wallets" are basically useless dust addresses that no one cares about.  If I throw a lot of pennies on the ground, and have a $100 bill in my wallet, does it matter that "99% of the locations of money in my house hold &lt;1% of my wealth"


I've heard this same thing since Bitcoin rose to an "insane" value of $1.  "What are you morons doing buying at $1?  It's just the early adopters that got in at $.05 that are going to get rich!"  Yawn.  This argument has been tired for 7 years.


Once hyperbitcoinization happens, of course hodlers will spend Bitcoin.  They'll have no other option, no one will accept any other payments.  They also have a limited lifespan and acquiring riches just to take to your grave is silly.

Running the nodes isn't the problem.  It's the mining centralization that's the issue.  Censorship occurs when miners only mine certain transactions that meet criteria needed, such as "only whitelist coins".  Or have collected Know Your Customer documentation for every transaction.
Hypothetically, let's say that big mining pools had a significant edge over small ones.  In that case, governments can easily take action against those operators to force their will.  Nodes are powerless in that case.  You have a significant censorship over Bitcoin, and basically destroy it's usefulness.
It's not the expense of the node in that case.
Expense of nodes is another issue, and basically changes calculus on when to run a node.  I run a node when I value verification of the network more than the cost to operate a node.  As a relatively small-time holder, running a node right now is still fairly cheap (though mostly through annoyance of chewing up CPU and bandwidth and storage on a machine I would be using).  I just don't get much benefit right now, and there are enough other people "keeping an eye on things" that if miners did cheat, I'd know.  I'd probably start up my node if I was receiving a large transaction, and then shut it off after I figured it was safe.
As that expense rises (which it will by increasing the block size), more marginal cases of verification become too costly to run.  Those that require more validation and more value from it keep them running longer, but certainly some shut off.  Now here, the risk is from sybil attacks.  Attackers can attack more marginal cases more easily since there are fewer nodes, and can fool others into thinking transactions occurred when in fact they did not.  That's the risk there, two separate issues, but certainly important ones.
I'm very concerned about the first one, as mining is already dangerously centralized today, and miners are relatively unsophisticated in terms of realizing how they can gain an edge.

I don't agree with this and would like to see why you think this.  Profit motives are tremendous.  Exchanges SUCKED (lol Mt. Gox) until there was a profit motive for it.  Now we have healthy competition.  Without the possibility of profit, you limit it to hobbyists.


Only because adoption -&gt; profits.  VC is dumping money in not out of the goodness of their hearts to help adopters, but because it represents an opportunity to profit.


I just don't follow this logic.  People come to Bitcoin (reasons unclear).  Then, someone just decides to create something for the hell of it because a lot of people use it?
Sure, adoption is one driver of profit potential, but there are many paths to get there.  People will not build things (other than for fun) for problems that do not exist and are unlikely to exist for some time.  So I'm just failing to see where that's coming from.
Thank you for staying civil in this conversation.  We both *want* similar things, we just have different ideas on how to get there.

You really are thick, aren't you Paul?
There are several "stable states" for Bitcoin.  They range from total failure to worldwide adoption and abandonment of other forms of money, and pretty much everywhere in between.
The way a lot of these companies that take on VC are structured is that they heavily depend on certain outcomes while they themselves fail in a world where Bitcoin otherwise would succeed (but not to the level they depend on). SV investment is common in the "home run" model, where you must have explosive growth to stay alive (and keep raising more funds, because profits and bootstrapping? Those are for suckers).  When Bitcoin naturally goes through hot and cool times, they suffer because the cool times keep them from raising more funds and they go under (since they aren't even close to profitable).  So they are more willing to take a risky change in Bitcoin, that may fuck everything up on the chance that it might be a gamechanger.
This is where the baseball analogy comes into play that you are too thick to understand.  In baseball, a single or double are very desirable outcomes where you are clearly better off.  But in the SV VC model, those are just as bad as striking out.  So you swing for the fences at anything that resembles a pitch, because that's the only way to get a home run.  You don't take a safe outcome when those opportunity arises.  This results in more strikeouts (Bitcoin completely falls apart and becomes worthless) and more homeruns (widespread adoption).  Meanwhile, I don't consider outcomes like doubles or singles bad.  If all Bitcoin does is take over 5% of the black/grey markets in the next 20 years, I consider that a huge positive.  Coinbase would be long out of business.  Sure, I'd love to have some huge outcomes too!  But Bitcoin is too important to destroy in the hopes that it might bring a homerun.

I agree.  Shopping with Bitcoin is something I view mostly as a joke, as it offers no real benefits.  There's a reason no one outside of the most devoted Bitcoiners do this, it's not terribly valuable!


When I shop online, I have about the same amount of effort, except I don't have to wire fiat to an exchange to acquire Bitcoins first.


If this is such a good deal for merchants, where are the discounts?  Hint:  It's not really that good a deal, and the savings it provides is destroyed by the cost of acquiring coin.


This is overblown.  I've had my CC# stolen, you get a call, tell them what you didn't buy, and get a new card.  And using Bitcoin doesn't insulate me, since I'm still having to use my card a ton anyway.  The risk and cost really makes this worth maybe a few cents at most.


I'm not sure Bitcoin has a significant edge over WU right now anyway.  You still need to acquire coin (painful, costly), and then convert back on the other end (often times impossible).  Setting up the WU model of having stores process for you adds the costs back.  So I'm not sure where this model *actually* is better.  Until people actually want Bitcoin on the other side without conversion, this doesn't really add up.


I disagree with this characterization.  I view "the system" as a much wider ecosystem built on top of an open framework.  Like it or not, Bitcoin simply does not scale.  It breaks down at some level, whether it's through having to add trust through node centralization or through price of transactions.  It simply does not have a good way to scale to global scales.  It's far more important to look in the more near term future.  Bitcoin can scale quite easily to any reasonable expectations in the next few years even without changing the block size.
Bitcoin already is elitist right now, though.  It's too costly and difficult to acquire to make sense for most people to use other than enthusiasts or people with niche needs.  That's ok, though, the internet used to be heavily elitist, and is completely open now to the masses.


You are thinking in today's models with Bitcoin's state potentially 10 years down the road.  I don't think it's reasonable to make assumptions about what the entire ecosystem will look like then.  For the next few years, a reasonable transaction fee (say 10-25 cents max) is not elitist and helps congestion enough.  If using Bitcoin for a transaction is not worth 10-25 cents, it's a joke use case for the most part.  Prove me wrong on this one.  Show me a use case where 10-25 cents somehow breaks the model down where it otherwise would make sense.


I'm in favor of new systems being built on top!  I think that's where we disagree. I vastly prefer an open bottom layer and trust-less semi-decentralized layers on top, rather than a trustful centralized bottom layer.
Moving cases where Bitcoin has no competitive advantage from alternatives is perfectly reasonable IMO.  If Bitcoin had vast competitive advantages in those use cases, we'd already have mass adoption.

There you go.  When people stop needing as many transactions, fees go down.   Then more use cases become profitable on chain, and then things fill up.
Costs are a bit different - larger tx's increase orphan risk, but for large miners that's actually an advantage (so a negative cost).
Not sure how the wholesale/retail compare happens here.  There is a scale, but this basically comes down to giving an advantage to large miners when they can make large blocks!  That's not a good thing!
But when supply is less constrained, price will go toward marginal costs, and when supply is constrained, cost will go toward what people will be willing to spend.  
But when there is less demand (which LN would hopefully do!), would mean fewer people are bidding for a limited resource, which would make prices drop.

I get that there's a subsidy and it will be there for a while.  It's not guaranteed the price of transactions would need to go up, only to provide that level of income.  Price also plays a factor.
Raising the limit does not cause growth by itself.
Thinking about it in terms of "spreading the fees across transactions" is not how economics work as well.  There is a demand curve, which may be elastic or inelastic.  It may be possible to cover 25 BTC of fees with 1MB much easier than 10MB!  The opposite may also be true - depending on the demand curve.
The benefit of creating the fee market now is to help understand that demand curve better and to gradually adjust users to such a market.  Allow wallets to handle congestion better while there are fewer number of users.  Allow the behaviors that need to occur, the patches like RBF that are desperately needed to get deployed so that in any mainstream adoption, people have a good experience, rather than get massively disrupted by a late fee market, or we end up with no security.
@_date: 2015-12-20 20:34:57
Unexpected?  To whom?  This has been known for years.
Yes, miners do have some operational costs that require a bit longer term (I'm sure bribes aren't cheap, and the warehouse/power requirements, etc...).   And miners success depends on two things- success of mining more blocks and success of a higher price - enumerated over timeframes of their investments.
I'm not sure price really matters too much on this - other than it may have been profitable to sell miners at unprofitable rates to the public when the public was more naive, and the public may have been fooled more by rising prices (or bailed out by it in an otherwise poor investment).
If the block size provides any advantage to consolidated miners, it certainly does have an effect.
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:02:58

The reason why miners prefer smaller blocks is due to propagation.  Changing propagation to simply send the header, and mining during verification removes this restriction, if I understand it correctly.
Simply put - the force that counteracts miners wanting to include every fee-carrying transaction is not something that can be guaranteed into the future.

Bitcoin, itself, remains decentralized.  You may prefer a centralized solution if you want speed and cheap transactions, and they are low value.  Or you can pay a fee in line with everything else.
But, if you view Bitcoin as a payment network, yeah it probably will fail, since it's a pretty shitty payment network and always will be, no matter what the block size is.

No.  Miners add work to the network making old transactions hard to reverse.  Transactions on LN arenlong settled and buried under work.  If the hash rate drops, old transactions are still secured by the old work.
@_date: 2015-06-03 00:05:20
If the new fork cannot win the hash race, it will get raced out of existence.  The profitability for miners on each fork will be determined by coin value and difficulty.  Thus, if the old fork has a higher value than the new fork, it will end up winning the race, orphaning the new fork.
Never catching up with the mempool is not a doomsday scenario.  Transactions get dropped out of the mempool, someone is free to try again, and we'll continue on.
Exchanges have no reasons not to support both forks.

It's not that clear.  One can win for a while, then the other could overrule that.  That is a serious risk with this fork.
@_date: 2015-06-18 01:55:05
Centralized mining is a far bigger risk to me than centralized nodes.  All I need is one peer to give me the truth, and I can be correct, even if the rest lie.  For miners, they become very susceptible to things like white-lists, regulations, etc... when centralized.  That's my concern.  Especially with this fork.  If it costs $20 a month to run a node, that sucks, but there's still enough of an incentive to pool resources and share a few nodes and trust them on some scale.
Different codebase is another issue.  Consensus needs to be the same codebase or else risk exists, but I would like to see more diversity here.
Thanks for the link.
I am not opposed to an increase, if the effects are studied and given proper time to analyze, and improvements be made.

FSS-RBF is not very user friendly - it creates a situation where you need an UTXO for every single modification to your transaction, which causes you to have less available to spend at any point and to bloat transactions (both costing you more and creating more congestion).
Full RBF allows you to simply make a revision to the transaction with no additional costs, and revise it as many times as you'd like.

Miners aren't the only ones bearing the expense.  The expense is borne by everyone who wishes to validate the network.  The cap is a way to limit that expense by the users of the network.  Until you find a way for these users to be compensated, you risk driving their expenses up, and there are consequences to that.

There is constant training and maintenance, though.  Staff turns over and needs to be re-trained.  No device lasts forever and always needs to be upgraded.  This is an ongoing expense.


I'm aware, but they also don't offer a discount for paying another method.  I can always donate 1% to the merchants if I really feel bad about their peril, I suppose.


Most of these are for buying stolen items.


And 2% is barely any reason to jump through so many hoops and ride a currency that has extreme volatility and is hard to secure and use except for the biggest enthusiasts.

@_date: 2015-06-16 18:08:53
This is untrue based on Hearn's comments.  He wants to push it through no matter what, including the case where &lt;50% of miners support it.
It's impossible to judge 75% support of anything, even if you were judging miners, since miners can lie or change their minds.  Miners will have an incentive to mine on whatever chain gives them the most profit, and what they think has that profit might very well be different once a fork occurs, so no malicious intent of a miner is even needed.

You said "winning" fork.  I guess it depends by what you mean by winning.
There is a scenario where new fork gets orphaned, which is, eventually, 51% of the mining power decides to move back to the old fork.  In this case, it's clear the old fork wins.  That's what I'm considering winning.
In any other scenario, both forks live on.  The difficulty of the old fork adjusts and those who want to stay on the old chain are welcome to do so.  The price will determine hashing power, and everyone moves forward, on their different path.
@_date: 2015-12-23 03:06:56

@_date: 2015-06-24 18:25:13


No, this is not my intent.  My intent is to retain Bitcoin's key value proposition - decentralization.


Running a node produces some amount of value, and the cost to operate compared to that value is what matters.  Costs go up, without increasing that value, nodes turn off.


This isn't so simple.  If no one runs nodes except a few, I'm vulnerable to sybil attacks.  If I cannot validate transactions, Bitcoin as a whole loses value to me, and I cannot trust it, so centralization may move me to not use Bitcoin.


It's a grayscale, there is no such thing as "good enough".  It's a complicated problem which is why consensus is hard.


Transactions are possible through centralized solutions in plenty of ways that will outcompete Bitcoin.  That's not the baby.


So how does the market decide what block size should be?  We all have to agree for consensus.  There are conflicting importances of various features.  How is this possible?  Just fork everything and let it settle in the dust?

@_date: 2015-06-27 00:16:03
It's no different than any other tragedy of the commons situation.  Consider a group of fisherman in a sea.  If they all think selfishly, they overfish, kill off the industry, and each is worse off.  Each fisherman could decide to fish in a selfless (short term) way, but unless the other fisherman agree, he's simply at a huge disadvantage to them, and likely goes out of business, and other fisherman who aren't so kind take over.  This problem is easily solved through a production quota system or property rights.  Fisherman who overfish are punished, and everyone ends up being better off.
Miners may as a whole choose to want to self-regulate, but incentive structures matter, and ultimately, many may have to act against long term interests or risk being run out of business.  Relying on miners hoping to selflessly mine for long term interests without the ability to punish defectors will result in an obvious result.
Miners could mine empty blocks today, but it's not costing them anything to include transactions that include fees.  Mining empty blocks isn't selfish, it's stupid.  With the exception of building on unverified blocks that have headers that make it across, of course.

A small amount of pain will just spur the code for this, you are seeing it now with miners going to RBF patches.  Wallets will learn that their users will abandon them for other wallets when they behave badly with congestion.  Wallet competition exists and those that best handle it will win.  Those who haven't taken this seriously will lose, and deserve to.

Sometimes it's time for a divorce.  I'm not sure we are there, but it might be worth considering.  There really are two camps - those that value censorship resistance as something that is something we are unwilling to compromise, and those that want free/cheap transactions, including micro-transactions.  These ideas are incompatible on a blockchain with any significant usage.  They worked out in the early stages of the relationship, but as things grow, split apart.  Now, we each want different things with different solutions which will sacrifice or destroy the other.
We can stay together for the sake of the kids, or acknowledge irreconcilable differences and split.  But then there is just bitter fighting over who gets "The Kids" - in this case, the name Bitcoin.
Rather than having an uncomplicated divorce and split, you have contention and attacks.  The truce should focus on managing this split without resorting to destroying each other.
@_date: 2015-12-27 18:51:55
20% each means 3 people (or 3 court orders) effectively censor Bitcoin.  And of course, it assumes these pools are even separately controlled.  And this isn't the age of pools just pledging allegiance temporarily, this is centrally controlled mining farms in a vertical operation.
Bumping against the limit doesn't mean that the network is ready.  It just means there is demand for cheap transactions at the current low price.  Miners collecting more fees is far from a given (and probably incorrect) - revenue = quantity * price.  If the price was 2x higher at 1MB than 2MB, then 1MB ends up with more revenue for miners.  Of course, miners can restrict blocks to try to drive up the price as well through a BIP 100-like soft fork, so it's not a huge deal.


If you are interested, this information is available.  Simply bumping the number doesn't buy very much (double the limits still doesn't really make much more possible, is 6-12tps really that much better if you are looking at *actual* scaling?).  However, solutions like LN enable a much greater amount of scaling (and require SW to end malleability).  Sidechains are useful for experimenting and making additions without requiring consent of everyone involved and limiting risk to only those who choose to go to that sidechain while maintaining the currency's value.    Simply increasing the size gets us very little other than a temporary boost that does nothing long term.  Continuing to increase the limit (as BIP101 does), relies on technology increasing far greater than it has shown to do in the past, or relies on changing the security model to simply trusting miners.  They are not solutions for scaling.

You are saying you need increasing growth of user base for adoption.  That's pretty much requiring pyramid scheme behavior.  Stability is fine, and should happen in the end.  Mass adoption is not required for stability. 


That has nothing to do with economics and more to do with a prediction.  And I think Satoshi was likely wrong here.  Bitcoin can survive as a niche currency for niche use cases, where it has properties far superior to alternatives in some use cases but not others.


That's not what I was asking.  You can't judge decentralization by user base.

It's not about subsidizing, it's about centralization. 


Strangely the price and number of transactions is not really correlated all that much.  




Miners can always set this at any point in time even if there was no hard limit, so that's not really what this is about.  This is entirely about protecting users from dangers of centralization.  Making it harder to run nodes, which means you must rely more on trust.  Making it less profitable for smaller miners, meaning that large miners control a greater share, and can do things like censor your transactions.
Show your work on how a block limit increases centralization.  No simulation or argument has ever shown this.

I can't speak for Todd, but I think he would view decentralization as a related variable to node count, but not the exclusive measure of it (- chime in if I'm wrong).  
As for the Blockstream smear, it's far more likely these guys have a common vision of how they view Bitcoin, rather than any other motive.  I don't think Hearn is motivated other than anything than coming to Bitcoin from a completely different view point and a different background (reliability engineer, downtime = THE DEVIL, anti-libertarian, not fearful of governments at all, etc...).  Everything is very clear from the lens of looking at where people are coming from, rather than assume ulterior motives.  Gavin is the one who is surprising me here to be honest.  I can't figure out where he's coming from.  I got involved in Bitcoin right around the time Satoshi disappeared, which was right around the time Gavin was taking the lead, then went to the CIA to give a presentation.  We should assume everyone is compromised, and Bitcoin must stand up to it, even if it's not true.  In most cases it's not.  I just cannot figure out how Gavin plays into this and why he's so convinced this is a crisis.

I do!  Part of the market is users setting a limit of the size of blocks they are willing to accept.  The market has judged consensus to be far more valuable than fragmentation and this limit will only be changed when the benefits outweigh the costs.


I don't!  The miners will decide this just fine on their own, and unlimited blocks will lead to miners deciding this.  However, miners with the lowest marginal costs will be able to include the most transactions.  This cost can even be negative if a big block can harm smaller miners and you gain an edge!  These situations are harmful in that Bitcoin now becomes more centralized behind fewer miners and pools, allowing for easier censorship.


Nope.  Users can do what they want!  By all mean switch to a chain that produces huge blocks.  You are free to do so today, and you are free to encourage miners to do the same, or change the POW algorithm or make a non-backward compatible fork so that your fork can persist even without miners following you!
But a user is also benefited by being in sync with the rest of the network as well, and there is a significant cost in a split.  The fact that no one has switched to a bigger block in a split shows how valuable this property is.  What good is a money if you are the only one who uses it?
The network effect just makes it far more important to be in sync with everyone else rather than have the optimized solution.  That is the free market at work.  Of course, nothing is stopping you from modifying the constant yourself, running the code, and seeing what happens.  It would range from benign (no miners agree, you just see the same thing) to very bad (a short-lived fork exists, you think you receive money, release goods/services, and the fork dies).
Enjoy the free market!

The new chain follows the same rules (plus is less strict), so every valid block on the old chain is potentially valid on the new one.  This is why Hearn needs to put centralized checkpoints in place in case miners decide not to mine on his chain.

- It's new.  People knee-jerk against anything new that they don't understand pretty reliably.
- People have made a lot of money on it.  This breeds jealousy, so anyone who was in the right place and right time didn't deserve their wealth, therefore they want to see it fail so those people don't actually gain on them.
- Poor presentation by enthusiasts.  Many enthusiasts have the fervor of a religious zealot and over-represent the benefits of Bitcoin, or speak to a world view most people don't understand (anti-authoritarian, anti-bank, even anti-war).
- It really isn't that useful for most people now, therefore they see this just as hype with no substance.  
- Association with drugs, money laundering, terrorism, child porn.  Most new technologies tend to be utilized best by black markets, so of course Bitcoin has had success here.  Add in a few other bogeymen and you lead to issues.
- No one is "in charge".  This really scares a lot of people.  This drives people to religion and big government.  Religious folks want to have an all-knowing, all-powerful God handling their affairs, alleviating any responsibility to them.  Beyond that, many others turn to the government as their Big Brother to look out for them.  Bitcoin doesn't have that, and no one is going to look out for you, no one is in charge, no one can undo things when you screw up.  This is scary to a lot of people.
- There are still questions.  The Bitcoin economy is incomplete and not ready for a lot of mainstream uses.  It's not the easiest to use, it's not the safest if you don't know what you are doing.  So this scares people, so they don't like it.

What you call stalling is making sure we have consensus and ability to do it and aren't overlooking anything.  We should err on the side of caution, especially when there is no crisis.
Avoiding hard forks is not a bad thing, as hard forks require a massive upgrade campaign which can be difficult (see how many times Windows had to delay cancelling support for XP).  A soft fork can be deployed much easier with support level measured accurately.

This is incorrect since miners who would seek to maximize revenues can shrink blocks however they see fit.  Obviously they want to balance long term and short term consequences so they may not seek to maximize immediate revenue.
But you are neglecting the public good problem from the blockchain being something that is useful to non-miners and that they have no control over.  This is a balance - as a user I want the blockchain to be small enough that I can handle it easily at low cost, but I want it to be large enough to allow for more people to interact with.  I've seen no other option to balance this other than a fixed cap.  Flex caps have promise but change incentives quite a bit.
For those not caring about running a full node, it's a no brainer to just increase it to whatever level - they will just trust whoever serves them data and trust miners not to inflate.  This debate really isn't about them.

He got a lot right, for sure.  He didn't get the scale part right.  He was mistaken about how mining would work out.
Even incentives have a lot to learn - we haven't seen what happens when the block reward decreases to a very low level, and that could very well be wrong.

It's the same thing when people appeal to what the Founding Fathers's intent was in the US.

The downsides of "reaching capacity" of a hosted website vs. Bitcoin are significantly different, for starters.  The behavior as you start reaching capacity are also different.
The decentralization aspect is also different.  For a centralized service like Google Maps, you only need to consider costs and serving the customer.  Decentralization is another angle to consider impact, and simply isn't relevant when using the compare.
The competition is also different.  If Google Maps goes down, people are going to have several other choices immediately available, and chances are a lot of those people never come back.
The market is a lot different as well.  Bitcoin is not even at early adopter phase, and comparing it to mainstream adoption of something like Google Maps has flaws.  Super early adopters are far more tolerant of flaws than mainstream adopters.  If they weren't, they wouldn't have jumped through the many hoops to come to Bitcoin in the first place.  I'd also *rather* have the pain now than say let's say that Bitcoin adoption rates went up 40x.

The new fork will still use the rules - chain with most fork is the real chain.  This means if 60% of miners use the old rules, which are also valid on the new chain, the users of the new network will see the same chain as users of the old network.  Miners on the new chain will get orphaned and lose everything.  Users who split coins and hold on the new chain lose everything.
The alternative to this is checkpoints, which Hearn has suggested as a last resort.  Of course, this is a never-ending game, because you can just have miners continuing to mine small blocks and even orphan larger locks even on the new chain, requiring more checkpoints.  This ends when people just trade their security model for having Chairman Hearn sign every block as valid or not.
@_date: 2015-06-18 00:25:23
I've explained it a few times.  I can try again if you want.
There is a set of rules that form a valid block currently.  There is a set of rules that would form a valid block in the fork.  The former set of rules is an inclusive subset of the latter rules.  This means, all things being equal, every block that is valid in the previous chain is valid in the new chain.  Say 40% of miners started mining the new chain rules, and 60% the old chain rules.  In this case, all the old clients instantly reject any new blocks from the new rule miners.  The new clients will accept whichever chain has the most work.  That chain, in the long run, will be the one with the most miners.  If the most miners are on the old chain, then the chains never diverge, other than miners on the new chain occasionally winning, then getting orphaned.  Miners on the new chain lose their ass in this case, and with any sense, move to the old chain anyway.  Difficulty does reset to 60% of what it was in that case, but that's irrelevant.
A checkpoint serves as a way of forcing new clients to ignore the most work chain.  For example, the chains diverge, Mike sets a checkpoint.  This means even if the other chain gets more work, the chains stay apart.  Of course, miners on the new chain could decide to just mine small blocks.  Which requires more checkpoints, and so forth.  There is nothing to FORCE miners to mine big blocks, unless that was somehow a new consensus rule.
So without checkpoints (or something equivalent), miners can veto the upgrade.
@_date: 2015-12-28 19:48:24


I process transactions too!  I run a full node!


They probably would, at least the miners who gain an advantage from slow block propagation, or large miners who are better equipped to handle big blocks which will knock out their competition.
The block size limit keeps the blockchain manageable such that many users (not just large miners) can actually validate the network and transactions, and not just trust miners or full nodes to tell the truth (or give up privacy to do so).


The capacity constraint is not artificial though.  It's how you handle public goods.  You set fishing quotas because you don't want overfishing, not because you want to make the price of fish high.  You set pollution caps because you want to limit the amount of pollution, not because you want to set power requirements high.
Blockchain bloat is the tarnishing of a public good, like pollution or overfishing.  The miners are not the only parties involved in the ability to access the blockchain - users also are.
The fee market is independent.  It will develop when space is restricted and is not a catastrophe- it was something envisioned by Satoshi.  I'm not suggesting this to raise income of miners (miners can force this at any point they choose without our consent anyway).  I'm suggesting it to protect regular users, who actually want the ability to validate their own transactions.

Not ignoring it at all.  Bitcoin has just as many unique and non-replaceable properties.   Gold is far from scarce, as any increase in value will just lead to more mining.  There is an absolute massive amounts of gold in the ocean for example that would become profitable to extract at certain prices.  Don't even get started on mining asteroids.  That's exactly proof that gold's scarcity is worse than Bitcoin's.  Gold becomes valuable enough and the supply gets increased through new forms of mining it.
The only thing gold has is legacy.  Literally the only thing it has on Bitcoin.  Every year Bitcoin survives decreases that until Bitcoin is just as normal as gold.
Take $6400 of gold and you'll likely end up with $6400 with gold in a few years, give or take 25-200%.  Take $6400 of Bitcoin and you'll likely end up with about $0 or $100,000+ of Bitcoin in a few years.  If you can't handle risk, go with gold.
@_date: 2015-06-18 00:29:00
This is not really true, at least if the only change was "allow up to 20MB blocks".  The chain with the most work and is valid wins.  1MB chains are valid on the new one, and if the majority of the miners stick with the old rules (similar to a soft fork), everyone who mines a &gt;1MB block will get orphaned. This is why miners will not switch unless they think the vast majority of other miners will switch.  Miners who guess wrong will lose.

Complete and utter trash.  So much bad information based on faulty assumptions.
The entire premise is built on it being a "hub and spoke" system.  This is incorrect.  While early documents did use a technical definition of hub and spoke, it does not mean that users would connect this way.  Core and LN would be indistinguishable, and users would not even notice a difference.


This is the first glaring assumption.  What is the cost of running a "hub"?  He provides zero details and just says it will be expensive.  What is this cost?


Another false assumption.  This example assumes only a single path from Alice to Bob.  There's no reason there wouldn't be multiple paths.


This is only true if money is actually inaccessible.  People put money in checking accounts and savings accounts that provide (near) instant access for virtually no interest today.  People put their money in because it provides them access to things (writing checks, sending money, using Debit Cards).  By having funds locked up in a channel, it is a cost (I have to wait a small amount to get it out), but I also have access to spend my funds on LN, which is a big benefit.  It's only slightly worse than having it in a hot-accessible wallet, and about the same amount of accessibility as being in a cold wallet.


Simply untrue.  You can use as little or as much as you want.


"I have no idea" followed with random numbers is usually not a compelling argument.  This again assumes a hub argument, where you want to open channels with large numbers of people for large amounts.  There is no reason why you couldn't set one up with $10 across 8 people.
He then goes onto this case of not having connections in the LN that connect people.  It does not take a large web to connect everyone (those who disagree should consider playing 6-degrees of Kevin Bacon, or simply look at Bitcoin, and try to make the assumption that a transaction you send might not make it to the miners).


This is simply not a problem.  Nodes can appear on and offline at will and the network functions fine.  If you are already running a Bitcoin node (which will be how you run a LN node), you'll leave your computer on most of the time anyway and sometimes be offline.  


More making up numbers to fit his conclusion.  Where is he getting these numbers?


Duh, how else do they verify they got a payment?  
Just really poor arguments all around, assuming a conclusion, making up numbers to fit his point, and completely misunderstanding how things work (strawman arguments).  Such a shame people spend this much energy criticizing something they don't even understand.

Transactions fees are a very minor blip.  We already have tons of ways to spend without transaction fees, or very minor ones.  Bitcoin cannot win on that.  To win, it needs to serve some purpose far greater than cheap fees.  It has had massive inflation since its creation which is only now just reaching reasonable levels, but it does provide future promise that does not exist.  And it allows payments to occur that otherwise could not happen.
Look at the crackdown on gambling sites that blocked banks in the US from having users fund legal overseas gambling sites.  Look at what has happened with VISA and Mastercard with being kicked out of Backpage.  Look at Silk Road and the marketplaces that have come in its ashes.  Competition cannot win there.  Bitcoin will prevail in those cases.
For users to adopt, they need a compelling reason.  The cypherpunks are already here.  The libertarian/gold bug types are mostly here.  Some of the techno-geek types are here, but what compelling case is for the rest?  You can hope for adoption, but they need something to be actually useful for them.  This payment distraction is exactly that.  I thought we would have learned from the last "merchant adoption" frenzy where nothing happened but the price dropping and early adopters cashing out that we would learn that merchant adoption does absolutely nothing for increasing the value of Bitcoin.  It's a joke.
So before scaling for no purpose other than to scale, maybe ask, why would it scale? And make sure those properties aren't thrown out the window in order to get it to "scale".
Dunning-Kruger explains exactly why so many "arm-chair" users want to increase the size.

Put 75% of hashpower on Mars.  25% on Earth.  With wormholes and instant propagation, 75%/25% block split.  Sometimes Earth finds it first, Mars builds on top, sometimes the opposite.  0% orphan rate.
Now we'll add the 22 minute delay.  When Mars finds a block first, all Martian miners get the block nearly instantly.  Earth miners will still keep mining for another 22 minutes on the previous block.
How do Earth miners get their blocks to Mars's chain, which will on average be longer?
First, Earth needs to mine a block.  The send it to Mars.  In the time it takes Earth to send it to Mars (22 minutes), Mars needs to be unlucky and not have found a block.  If Mars finds a block in that time, they ignore the Earth block.  So that's one way to get in.
Earth gets a block to Mars when P(M not finding a block &lt; 22 minutes).  Mars has a block discovery rate of a mean of 15 minutes on a Poisson distribution.  So 22% of that time, Mars hasn't found a block and includes Earth's block.  Now to account for the other 78% of the time Earth finds a block.
If Mars does find a block, it gets trickier.  Mars keeps mining it's chain, and Earth on its.  The blocks get sent and ignored unless one views the other as ahead.  Earth still has a chance to win on Mars if it can find another block (and transmit it) before Mars finds one.  The mean time for Earth to find a block is 40 minutes.  This gives Mars roughly an hour on average to find a block.  Something Mars does 98% of the time.  So in the average case, Earth has a 2% chance additionally to get their block included.
Earth could get lucky, and find a second block very fast and send it (say Earth is lucky and gets a block in 5 minutes, and sends it).  Mars has 27 minutes to find another block to bring it back to a stalemate (from their perspective).  That's 42% of the time it's back to even, and 58% of that time Earth gets it to Mars in time.  Earth only accomplishes finding a block that fast &lt;1% of the time, so it's pretty insignificant.
So these are all low percentage events that happen.  So even when Earth is finding a block, they are getting orphaned huge amounts of the time.  On the order of 60-70%.
Now obviously this is a toy example with extreme scales to demonstrate it more clearly.  But replace Mars with China, and 22 minute time delay with Great Firewall or "hard to validate blocks", and you have a similar concept.  The orphan rate shrinks from 60-70% to something lower, on the magnitude of a few %, but remember that mining is a very low margin game.  A few % orphan rate can make a big difference in profits, which will lead miners to point toward more centralized hashing powers or simply not invest.
I'd love to turn this into some kind of simulated video or demonstration where you can trigger events and it would show probabilities.
Hopefully you can see why having slowly propagating blocks can actually work as an advantage to large miners.  By keeping others from seeing my blocks, in situations where more hashpower is mining on mine than old chains, I can essentially turn other miners into orphan-magnets.  Which is why selfish mining is a concern for centralization and indirect selfish mining through naturally occurring slow blocks is a concern even when miners are "altruistic".

Yes, we can if we need it.  No one is denying that.  Just there is no clear definition of what need means.  What if it worked just fine except we had to pay a dime for transactions?  Is it needed?  Needed also implies looking at tradeoffs and seeing how things are also effected.

Flex cap definitely seems like the right approach, but getting the incentives right will be tricky.
Dynamic fees already exist, although wallets are pretty shitty for handling this and the stubbornness that prevented RBF from being rolled out has made it harder.
@_date: 2015-12-29 21:43:26
Including transactions is at the discretion of the miner.  If they are unable to validate a block fast enough, they have two options - keep mining and get the reward, or just wait.  Waiting is worse for the network, since you have less hashpower securing previous transactions, so might as well have them mine.
This will go away when the block reward drops.  In fact, you'll probably see miners stop mining waiting for a big enough backlog to start mining again.  There could be some very strange incentives that pop up with little block reward.
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:57:36
I don't see how consensus now is harder than later.  We already have a pretty broad ecosystem, and any significant opposition will exist now or later nearly the same.  If anything, a second hard fork should be easier, since we'll know what worked and didn't and be able to work on those areas.
As for your speed, upload speed is definitely on the high end.  It's about the top end of what is available where I live, which is a fairly major metropolis in the US.  Running a node tends to affect other people connected's performance - Netflix starts lagging, other people have performance issues, especially after a resync.  I actually did run out of disk space since I had dual boot partitions, so I either need to reinstall everything or try to reclaim disk space which is a huge pain in the ass.

The sum of the parts is less than the whole in the case of division, unless you end up with some worst of both worlds compromise where both values get broken (not cheap and not decentralized).
XT sidechain would have been ideal, but the anti-blockstream conspiratards would never go for that.  XT users generally don't run full nodes and subscribe to a "trust the miners" philosophy anyway, so an SPV sidechain for them would be perfect.

Call anyone who disagrees a troll, it might be true.  You spit out buzzwords that meant nothing together.


It might.  But it doesn't mean I WANT that.  This is called a trade-off.  Sometimes you must choose between several competing things that you value.  That doesn't mean something you value is not actually wanted, but simply it is not as high a priority.
Adoption and usage are different animals as well.


It might hurt adoption (it would certainly hurt usage!, adoption is not as obvious), but it certainly increases incentives to create scalable, secure solutions.  This doesn't mean I *want* to hurt adoption.  I also would prefer to have pain now rather than later, as adopters now are more core believers in the ethos and are more tolerant of inconveniences.
For Bitcoin to rise to $9/transaction, even on a 1MB block, would represent an unbelievable amount of growth in adoption and usage.  It's completely unrealistic it occurs in the short term and long term, as it would take way too much growth to shoot up now, and it would have so much time to build alternatives that would alleviate demand.  If we kept a 1MB block, I'd expect the fee to grow to no higher than 20-30 cents per transaction, which is still cheaper than credit cards, at most.  That's pretty much a worse case scenario and would represent a great deal of adoption growth.
But don't forget that choosing one side of a trade-off means that you actually WANT the other thing to happen.  It's like saying because I bought something at the store, I *wanted* to have less money.  That's ridiculous, so quit making up lies.  It's a sign of desperation in your arguments.

Hot water derived through electricity is inefficient compared to other sources.  Electricity is just not that efficient for these things.

Revenue = Price * Quantity.  You cannot simply say that you need a massive number of transactions without describing how the price is affected.
Also, suppose all Bitcoins are locked in LN and no one ever wants to settle.  In that case, what does it matter if miners have revenue or not?  The benefit of miners is to make transactions difficult to reverse.  If there are no new transactions, then there is nothing that needs to be protected.

In this case, effectively, it would be dead, but technically alive.
It gets more interesting with say a 90%/10% split.  In a 10% split, you end up with 20 weeks before resetting, you have 100 minute average block times.  The adjustment drops to roughly to 5 week intervals with 25 minute block times, followed by a return to normal times.
A hard fork would be possible in this case as well, where holdouts realize mining power won't mine, so a hard fork that resets difficulty manually, but that guarantees that the big block fork cannot be outrun.

This type of crime already would show a tendency away from rational, and more toward short term gratification without considering long term consequences.
And any case, thieves killing someone who does not comply may be a more rational long term play, where now those they threaten now have a reason to want to comply, even knowing the thief is worse off.
Victim Compiles:  Loses $X
Victim Does not Comply: Loses $0/ chance of being murdered
Thief gives up after no luck: $0
Thief murders after no luck: $0/threat of going to Jail.
So the Victim's behavior here is determined by the thieves believed actions.  The best thing a Thief can do is give every indication he will murder you if you do not comply and to make the victim think he is irrational.

I'm aware of block rewards, and it's great for bootstrapping the network.  Miners can of course mine smaller blocks to force bigger fees if they want, so that's not the concern.
The concern is how you allocate space to a fixed limit.  Prices do that.  The fees could be destroyed for all I care, but the purpose is the same - determine the most efficient uses of a public good and let those who are willing to bid the most use it when the resource itself is scarce.  Having to pay a fee is not a crisis.

Yes you could cash out on an exchange, and spending on Amazon is exactly that.  However, look at all the idiots on here who proclaim great victory when every merchant adopts.  They will start decreasing their holdings to spend rather than just sitting tight.  There are certainly people where the friction of spending is less than exchanging.  For example, it's much easier for me to spend than go through coinbase to cash out or even an exchange where I don't even have an account.
The mining keeping the price down is insufficient, as the market cap would remain the same in that case, and clearly it has dropped -   We are seeing far more than a dilution in value of each coin, we are seeing even more dropping.  Miners selling coins is nothing new as well.

A 21 computer chip is completely non-viable as a for-profit miner, and these types of applications almost always will be the case.  And even worse, those miners are hard-coded to only work with one pool, so it might as well be the factory.
And having someone on staff to monitor thousands or millions times more scale than something else is insignificantly cheap compared to those devices being run by individuals.


WAT.  This makes no sense.  First, governments aren't going to hold any significant amount of coin as investment.  You read one rumor about a tiny island nation that might do something (and probably won't).  That's a far cry from anything.

FSS-RBF- I explained, it requires users to make bigger and bigger transactions (which cost more fees), and requires you to have a new UTXO for every single change you make.  It's completely unusable.
The difference between opt-in and full is opt-in provides an illusion of security that isn't there.  It's like putting a guard rail next to a cliff with 4 rusty bolts holding it in.

And miners without those connections would create smaller blocks, putting them at a disadvantage in collecting fees.  No one thinks every block would be 20MB, but yeah, certainly no one thinks that there is some requirement that blocks be 20MB.
Isn't that big block advantage taken away if there was relaying of headers of new blocks, and immediate mining occurred on those headers?  Of course, no one can force sending headers only, so it may be for nothing.

The opposite has been the case.  Speculation has been the vast majority of adoption, and speculators want a rising price.  A rising price signals speculators to jump in and not miss out, which rises the price more.  Hence every bubble and adoption rise.  The adoption from other purposes (mostly black markets) is minimal compared to this, especially since most black market adopters aren't long term holders and just flip in and out quickly.

Yes, everything hits the block chain, it's just batched up.
As for manipulating prices and all, don't see how that is relevant.  The debt is steady in Bitcoins and Bitcard is simply an intermediary.  The transfer technically happens at the time of sale.  Bob has some exposure to Bitcoin prices in this situation.  But this assumes he wants that exposure, otherwise he'd use something similar to BitPay or Coinbase where they would just sell Bitcoins in bulk at some point and reimburse based on time of sale in dollars or Euros or whatever asset the merchant wants.  This business becomes much simpler than something like BitPay and lower fee (in principle) because they are just collecting a bunch of funds and then just repackaging them together to send in different directions.
The situation isn't that BitCard owes Bob $500 worth of Bitcoins, he simply is owed a fixed number if bits, and Bob can use his judgement to determine when he wants to actually collect, and weigh the disadvantages of transaction fees to amount he is getting.  The important part here is every single transaction in the chain basically disappears, unless BitCard chooses to keep them.
There's a part I omitted about refunds to protect BitCard from holding them hostage, but there's mostly a solution to that with a future refund that can be given out and is only valid if BitCard (or Bob in the reverse case) hasn't redeemed any transaction after a set period of time.

The one place where merchant adoption does help is in the cases where you want to pay someone who is on the fence about Bitcoin, and when they see they have lots of options to cash out, they'll accept Bitcoin as a payment and redeem when necessary.  I'm curious how many numbers this is.  Which is why I encourage people to settle debts with friends or doing business with individuals to send Bitcoins if possible.  This assumes they *actually accept* Bitcoins rather than put them in Coinbase and get cash.  But even that seems preferable in that it gets someone comfortable.

A central service could exist, but would not need to be trusted on any level, as they could instantly update their payment channel to each person in their network.  Or just do it completely off-chain with something like OT or even just internal accounting (for small balances, who cares about high security).

Yes, today's world, today's software.  Minor changes fix this very easily.  Bitcoin in general is just a terrible user experience anyway, adding a few more hiccups doesn't exactly make that big a difference, at least in my opinion.  And those hiccups are easily solved, especially when there is pressure to solve them.


You are arguing against a case I am not making.


I view ordinary commerce is a very minor part of Bitcoin, especially today.  Maybe down the road.  It gives such little value to the currency and is such a trivial use case and Bitcoin is not even better than alternatives here.  Black-market commerce, certainly it is better, and this already happens off-chain in many cases.
I have no fear of trust-less centralized solutions.  I fear centralized-trust based systems, which Bitcoin could become very easily as you make it more difficult to run a node.  This is far from the case of PayPal, where you have a trusted third party.  I do not advocate trusted third parties.

This is untrue.  Without checkpoints, the majority of miners will orphan any miners who decide to mine big blocks, thus a small chain becomes the one with the most work on XT.  Miners aren't stupid enough to switch to something where they'll lose their money, so they would want a minimum 75% to move forward, and even that number is likely too low for a miner to really risk it.

The nice thing about Bitcoin is you can know if you actually control the Bitcoins if you want to hold them yourselves rather than coupons.  But then again, people continue to get burned letting others hold their Bitcoins and treating coupons as identical (Mt. Gox, Zhou Tong, etc...).

People who pay with checks already do this.
@_date: 2014-10-26 14:35:12
Say you are on an exchange, and you just pool everyone's money together.  You deposit Bitcoins, and you get an IOU from Mt. Gox for Bitcoins.  You deposit dollars, you get an IOU for dollars from Mt. Gox.  You make a trade, you actually swap IOUs that are in their database.  When you deposit the dollars, your account gets a +$100 IOU, and Mt. Gox accounts themselves -$100 IOU.  Their bank account holds a balance of $100, so it should even out.
A naked short allows you to sell an IOU you don't have (it can just be printed out of thin air, it's just a ledger entry).  You can sell your balance negative.  If you are shorting BTC, you sell an IOU you never had, so your BTC balance goes to -1BTC, Mt. Gox would get a balance of +1 BTC (meaning you owe them the BTC at some point).  This might be something where you have collateral (you keep $500 in your account, if BTC crosses $450, they force you to buy one and pay them back).
So that's how you sell something you don't have.

You are missing something.  Why are mainstream users going to even bother with frictionless acquisitions of Bitcoins?

Does this introduce the first two, who were motivated to acquire them before?  Probably not.  Does it increase speculators?  Probably not with the falling price.
It may turn speculators eventually if enough current adopters now can acquire more coins at low prices to stabalize things and get a run going, though.

@_date: 2014-10-01 21:20:35


Argument by assertion.


Completely backwards.  If the price is "low", and people buy it, that brings the price back to the "appropriate" level.  Without someone to do this, the price would keep falling lower and lower, or higher and higher, as no one would try to balance out these swings.  You bring up Forex, which is dominated by speculators, which do exactly that, keep things relatively stable.  For if they didn't, it would swing wildly any time anyone needed to switch from one currency to another.


Argument by assertion again.


Hey more assertions without anything to back them up.  You are speaking of Unit of Account rather than currency.  Which is fine, don't use Bitcoin as a unit of account.  This does not make it less useful.  So things aren't denominated in Bitcoin, who cares?


So you rail against speculators, and the solution is to have more speculators HODL?  LOL.  Your confusion of the word currency with Unit of Account has led you down this path of complete idiocy.

This would be no different than today.  Some businesses run nodes and accept payments that way.  Some businesses use centralized payment processors (like BitPay, Coinbase), like today.  If they outsource their payments, then it simply moves the connectivity to users like Coinbase and BitPay.  This is not a specific criticism to LN, but to centralized payment processors, which exist with or without LN.


Coinbase already does this today.  So I'm not sure what your question is.  Some routes may go through there, some may not.


How do businesses such as Target, Dell, Best Buy, etc..., have inventory?  Staff?  They only need enough to cover small number of costs.  Say Target accepted Bitcoin directly.  They have expenses.  They either need to pay for these expenses in Bitcoin or in fiat.  So they have a route that goes to some employees or suppliers that are due payments.  Their node receives payments and pushes it back out to those it owes money to (or to cash out).  It only needs small amounts at any point in time.  This is no different than saying a business like Target cannot happen because they need to have change in the tills to give out to customers who need change.

It gets even more muddled when the funding to such scientists comes from governmental bodies.  The more severe and exaggerated damages are, and the more urgent the crisis is, the more funding they get.
Imagine you are studying something you think is very important and essential.  You need to constantly convince your boss how much money to spend in such in your department.  You are more likely than most people to feel your research is important (why would you waste your life on something not important?!).  But it's tougher to sell this to your boss.  So you need to show as much evidence as possible to show him how important and essential it is, and what will happen if you don't get funding!  Your boss also needs to get support from his boss.  If he can use this to advantage he will as well.
The natural result is that all dangers are exaggerated, costs to "solve" the problem are underestimated, and the political powers use this manufactured crisis for their own benefits.
Of course, you end up with opposition parties who want to go the other way, and just deny anything you have to say because it serves their interests.
What we really need to look at is.
1) Is it happening?
2) What is the impact if we do nothing.
3) What are the options for action?
4) What are the costs of each action?
5) What are the benefits of each action?
Notice I didn't put "Did we cause it" on the list.  Totally unimportant.  If an asteroid was coming toward earth, it wouldn't matter if some gravitational pull by a probe pulled it closer or it was just bad luck, we'd need to act because the cost of inaction is too severe.

If everyone wanted to hoard Bitcoin, the price would raise considerably until people who had Bitcoin were so rich they would want to cash some out just to enjoy life (e.g. no longer hoard).

Top 10 is stretching it quite a bit.  That is some pretty illiquid crap currencies in there.  I think Dogecoin will displace Litecoin once the "ASICFREE!!!!" hype is destroyed from Litecoin.  Dogecoin doesn't have that issue since it doesn't pretend to be Silver to Gold.
I do disagree that the idea of treating a currency as worthless is a good idea.  It's a good idea to bootstrap, and Doge has bootstrap better than any cryptocurrency I can think of.  It's still a long way down, but it's fun and that's all that matters.  It's a sign of immaturity or overmaturity of a currency when everyone just spends it as fast as they can get it.  Doge is still in its infancy and is growing its community.  Good for them doing what they are doing.  Once people would rather have than give, things change.  Bitcoin had this at one point, and it went away when it matured.  Doge may grow beyond this or it may not.
Retailer use is pointless since retailers just discard and go to their favored currency ($, Euro, Bitcoin, etc...).  It just is another sink for Doge to lose value.

And the end result is obvious that all FRBs in a fixed supply will end in a bank run, the only way to properly manage it is to not play.
The reason that the bank runs were less frequent here is that the dollars were indistinguishable.  You cannot create a Bitcoin out of thin air, and there is always more risk in having a Bitcoin in a FRB, therefore the FRB fake bitcoins will always be worth less than a Bitcoin.  Someone accepting payment in fake bitcoins doesn't get the interest, so they would immediately redeem for Bitcoins, beginning the depletion of assets.  The only way a Bitcoin FRB could exist for any period of time is if no one knows that's what it was (Gox).

What a persuasive argument.


The differences between an insecure algorithm and one under attack are not different at all in their affects.  If it is under attack, it proves it is not the most secure, unless all other networks are also under an attack.


You don't know that.  We don't know it won't happen now.  This is an uncertain game.  There is not a black and white separation of secure and insecure, only degrees of security.
Less miners doesn't always mean less security.  Greater hash rate doesn't mean more security between algorithms.

I've been around long enough to see how this works.  Perhaps he believes he is actually helping things, I have no idea what's going on in his mind.  Typically, they will believe that they need to be actively involved in meddling in everyone's matters to make sure everyone is safe and every child gets a pony.  People who become regulators only do so when they believe that their role is so important that there would be chaos without them.  So they have their biases in almost all cases.
I'm sure he was given guidance by those who were the most politically connected.  That's just how it works.  They of course have interests in overly broad rules, and the regulator gets a lot of inputs and will just add every regulation on top of each other, since it all is helpful, and just adding more rules makes everything better.  Of course the politically connected steer it towards their interests, and can continue to rent seek and drive out any threats to their livelihood through excess regulation.  This is nothing new, and has been going on for hundreds of years (if not thousands).  Occasionally, there is enough popular opinion to fight back, or something slips through before they can get their hands on it (the internet is a good example), but those cases are rare.
But keep living in your bubble.  Maybe study up on some history.  The difference between the Mafia and the Government is that the Mafia only wanted 10%.

That depends how you define rational.  It is more complex, of course, but incentives do matter.  Even if you have someone wishing to spite attack, if it was that cheap, there would be plenty of people willing to add hash power to the network for personal gain, which increases the cost.
We are going faster than Moore's law for now, but will eventually be bound by it.
And yes, it does get more expensive.  Look back 4 or 5 years, and tell me the cost of a 51% attack.  I guarantee it was cheaper than it is now.  Cherry picking the cost now vs. 2 years ago doesn't mean much by itself, and in fact, seems to be an assertion, as the entire Bitcoin value was considerably lower than it is today.

Buying a safe that costs $100 and is used to protect a low amount of valuables is equally foolish.  I don't buy a top of the line safe to protect something dirt cheap.
LOL @ "which could become".  Obviously reevaluate at that point.  If you get ripped off for $1K, deal with it.  Using $100 to protect $1K is just idiocy.  What credit cards are you paying fees for?  Because it's baked in, whether you use it or not.
This question all comes down to how much you have to protect and what the alternatives are.  If I can be reasonably safe in protecting a small amount, and deal with the risk if I lose it, then it's foolish to act otherwise.  Getting a LoJack on a beater car is about the same as using $100 to lock up $1000 in Bitcoins.

Tx1a makes it into block 1A, but not into block 1B.  You see block 1A first and think it is the next.  1B is seen first by a lot of miners.  Sender of Tx1a makes a double-spend that has a higher fee (tx1b), which gets to miners.  They act in their self interest and include the higher fee transaction (replace-by-fee patch).  Block 2B is found and published with Tx1b.

Bitcoin is unique compared to dollars.  Even though it is less liquid, it provides other advantages, such as lower transaction costs, speed of payment, security, etc...  So it fills a niche and can survive without being dominant.  Any competitor to Bitcoin will need to improve on some factor of those issues to either defeat Bitcoin or fill a niche.  I believe the one positive argument out of the affirmative team was that it was possible for other currencies to exist to serve some niche.  For example, if the Bitcoin blockchain becomes too expensive for some kinds of transactions, it might be beneficial to have a "cheaper" one, that maybe does not provide the same level of security, but can exist for smaller cases.
Namecoin might be the only example I can think of that serves this purpose.  It has value in having a network effect (it would be dumb to have lots of different DNS lookup coins), and can be it's own blockchain with different needs than Bitcoin.  They can exist in parallel, namecoins will hold some value, although much less than Bitcoins.

Depends which people you are talking about.  Again, you place an over-importance on the current set of miners as the only set of miners that could ever exist.  Miners are a commodity, to be replaced by whoever gives the best result at the best price.  Obviously long term effects of arbitrarily shifting exist, but the consensus system makes it unlikely to occur unless it's a significant problem.  If Bitcoin ended up switching from the current crop of ASIC miners to whoever is mining Litecoin with Scrypt ASICs to whoever is mining other coins with CPUs several times due to attacks, it would cost whoever is running the attacks significant sums of money for only temporary stoppages.  It becomes an extremely expensive attack very quickly.  The current mining investors get hurt.  Oh well.  Sucks, but providing an ineffective product (network security) usually leads to being knocked out of business.

As for  it's possible that a separate chain is needed for niche activities, although its unlikely for those coins to retain any value since they make no sense to hold long term.
If you want to listen to why they are scams, you could listen to any number of podcasts that feature Daniel, like the one in this thread, or read any of his work.  It's not very complex.
The projects themselves may end up being successful, but the coins will be worthless.  The projects will just get forked into a Bitcoin-accepting version if they achieve any amount of success.

It depends on the amount they are buying.  And Coinbase certainly isn't faster for these cases.  It takes quite a while to get my coins, unless you get verified at level 2.  While you may consider it niche, it's going to be much more common in the future, when Bitcoin is *actually useful* in more areas, rather than just a speculation tool.
There also is the trust issue of linking your bank account with Coinbase, which many will be unwilling to do, and instead just putting cash into a machine and being done with it.
This type of model is very common in Latin America with online gaming.  You go to an office that will accept funds, and then the funds are available for you to gamble with.  Sometimes they even provide the computers for you!  ATMs would follow this model.  I put funds in, send to a friend, to gamble with, whatever, and he receives it on the other end and cashes it out when he's ready.  I could see this even being beneficial for small money transfers across the country or remittance.  Way less hassle than dealing with Coinbase in many cases.

Implement it the code to publish "I want to hard fork" into blocks that are mined if they agree.  If above some threshold of blocks mined, start publishing larger blocks and anyone who disagrees will use a different chain.  Set the threshold large enough that it only gets adopted if a huge percentage agree.  This only looks at miners of course, and if miners want to adopt this but users don't in large numbers, the miners end up mining blocks that are ignored by users and give them meaningless coins.
It's going to be pretty hard to convince a lot of people to adopt that change, although he's got his "Bitcoin Foundation" pulpit he can stand on and a lot of people will just accept it at face value.

You deposit 100 dollars in a bank.  You have $100 in your bank account.  $10 will stay in the vault.  The bank then will loan out $90 of those to someone else, who deposits in their account, who now also thinks they have $90.  $81 of that gets loaned out, and there's now $19 in the bank vault, and they owe a total of $190 to people.  This continues until there is $900 outstanding and all $100 is back in the bank.
Now people come to cash out their $900.  Only $100 is actually the vault.

The assumption that miners operate at an optimal level is faulty.  If you cut off the block reward from them, it may mean tx fees increase, it may mean many miners just shut down, or it may mean nothing.  The high frontloading of rewards is such that the network grows in strength faster than demand would otherwise stipulate, similar to how a lot of startups operate at a loss initially to grow faster than they otherwise would.

The energy put into PoW is fairly significant - right now we are looking at smoething like $15/transaction due to the subsidy.  Without that subsidy, we'd have far less security, and all of the eggs would be in that same basic.  There's nothing wrong with that, it just is pretty expensive compared to a centralized solution.
Now the security benefit is certainly reasonable - you'll be better protected in those cases.  But there's a cost.  And keep in mind in such a system that is already centralized by its nature, the issuer needs to still worry about being attacked and have fake tickets issued at the will of an attacker.  That could even invalidate the other tickets issued.  So it's a problem you aren't going to avoid (centralization).  The only problem being solved with decentralization is transferring of ownership, which a venue really doesn't care about too much, and can easily handle with centralization if they did care about it.
Then again, places like Stubhub are able to charge huge fees to consumers because of the risk of tickets being invalid and being able to guarantee validity and refund/get more tickets for someone if they turn out to be invalid is expensive.

3)  It's just easier to copy an address or scan a QR code than use a credit card.
4)  I can get a discount sometimes.
I won't use Bitcoin with companies I consider a chargeback risk.  I'm not sure how I'm vulnerable to additional scams or wallet stealing.
Instant transactions are pointless for online purchases, as I won't get my goods immediately anyway.
You can get Bitcoins in ways other than buying them, and I agree if you don't want to hold Bitcoins, acquiring them for spending is silly in most cases, unless they don't take other methods of payment.

You keep your money in your coinbase linked bank account until you need coins.  The advantages would be less/no fees for that conversion, and having it done immediately.

Mining centralization would be something that would be worthy of a change, but it is a very tough problem to solve.  Experiment through an alt-coin first, and see what happens.
Instant can be solved without any kind of protocol changes.  Trying to centralize Bitcoin to support instant rather than adding central entities on top is the problem.  The idea that people spending Bitcoins will drive its value is also highly flawed.  Crowdfunding is the only thing that seems like it could be useful, although I'm sure Hearn will find a way to screw it up.
I'm all about building layers on top of Bitcoin to support it.  Only when there are drastic flaws (like the advantages pooled miners get from centralizing) should there even be a consideration of protocol changes.  Loosening some rules, like OP Codes that are disabled for relaying or allowing more complex signing would also be useful, but again, doesn't really require a protocol change, just a loosening of what is considered standard.

No one is saying that you will likely lose it.  You need to be able to stay cool if you do lose it.  When it has dropped 75% (like it has several times), you need to not freak out and jump off a bridge or cash out because it means so much to you.  Getting people to only invest at a level they feel comfortable with is the right decision.
Once you have the mindset it all will be lost, you won't freak out if it goes down.  You can only be happy with how things go.

Rising or decreasing prices doesn't matter at all for this.  If the price rises, it changes the equation on whether or not you get protection.  If it gets stolen before the price rises, then you rebuy at low prices.  There is no shortage of obtaining coins, thus, no opportunity cost lost in stolen coins.  The only exception is if the price rises so quickly that I cannot get a Trezor or protect my coins in that window, where I need to have one ahead of time.  Things happen quickly, but the alternatives are quite good for my use case (HODLING).  The amount of hackings have decreased tremendously since wallet software improved through basic security measures, and cold storage has become much more accessible for those without it.
I already have a secure, free, solution for passwords and identities, and it certainly wouldn't be useful for me.

I didn't say they couldn't buy it, just that it wasn't effective.  Risk of theft in most use cases is minimal now and generally easy.  To justify spending $100 to protect anything less than $10000 of assets is probably silly and overkill.  Even at the $10K mark, you are looking at a 1% cost of holding, and really only makes sense if you need frequent transactions.
For niche cases of very large holders who are also frequently needing access, it works great.
But yeah, the smaller number of early adopters like yourself sitting on massive Bitcoin holdings, it's probably a trivial purchase.

Sure, it's definitely different competencies, but if one is significantly more profitable on one end, that's the business you want to be in and get the competencies for it.  B2C is a pain in the ass and dealing with chargebacks and complaints and support would mean you would need to have huge margins to make up for it, hard to not have the competency to run it yourself.  It's just lack of funding that would get you to selling presales.  Which is basically the game plan of every major mining operation right now.

Everyone tipping with Dogecoin shows how worthless it is.  Random people get it, show appreciation with a meaningless/worthless gesture, then people pass it along because it's easier to just pass on your trash to someone else than to keep it for yourself.
Thus, Doge has a high velocity, as it's a poor store of value.  Everyone knows memes have very small lifetimes, thus it's a game of pass the buck when you get a small tip, since cashing it out is not worth the effort.

Yeah, the franchise network is much more feasible here because you don't need to trust anyone.

You could have a set of unspent tx outputs that exist at some block.  That is the new "genesis" block in some sense.  Chain from that point.  You still need to trust that the utxo at that point was correct and the difficulty of that block is correct going forward, as you have no proof that is actually correct.

There's no way to prove it one way or another, but I think the idea that Cyprus was any kind of driver is likely wrong.  Yes, there are limited tools, but keep in mind where people are most limited, they are not going to really have access to escape to Bitcoins in that case.  Most people are overconfident and don't think it will happen to them until it's too late.  People will already have their assets locked before they even think to convert them to anything else in the bail-in situation, and it won't make a dent on Bitcoin in those cases.  You basically need a situation where somehow Bitcoin is easily available and assets can only be converted to Bitcoin - I'm not sure I'm seeing where that scenario would exist.

You are looking at someone who is a mainstream adopter or laggard, not an innovator or early adopter.
Keep in mind, I don't personally think like this, but it represents people who are later adopters.  You have to understand their motivations.  They don't care about "what could be".  They care about what is useful for them now.  And it's not that useful for them right now, barring a few use cases or few locations.  In fact, it's not only not compelling, but it's remarkably worse.  People who try to "live on Bitcoin" can, but it's usually more inconvenient and costly.
So it's not for them, yet.  You can, try to get them excited about what it might be used for in the future, that it isn't used for now.  The people who adopt now are either people who enjoy being on the forefront of technologies and get pleasure out of the growing pains of being first, or they are people who are trying to see into the future and see it as something more valuable (and either want to make money or be a part of something that will grow).
You aren't going to convince them to use it now, unless it really is more useful for them.  So find a use case where it is more useful for them, and if you cannot, don't sweat it.  It's not ready for them yet, and they aren't ready for it.

I have no special knowledge of the business dealings, but affiliates may very well get a cut.  They might also do it "for free" just to increase business for other services they offer (e.g. grocery store opening it so people spend money there).
Correct, the whole third party model might not give Bitcoin an edge in remittance.  A p2p model likely does give an edge, but there's no money to be made there.  And still there's no edge now, getting Bitcoin is still reasonably expensive, and someone on the receiving end would have little use for you.  It's definitely a chicken and the egg issue.  Maybe this is one place merchant adoption actually helps - if people in these other countries do not have access to something like a credit card to order goods online from a place like overstock or dell, they might prefer having Bitcoins precisely for this purpose.

Even if it was affiliates, there's a pretty reasonable level of trust from the endpoints to trust WU to pay up on anything they owe.
As for cheaper, it's possible they are large enough they can charge higher prices than there would be if the marketplace was competitive.  The only other part I can see that's better is authentication of users picking up remittance.  I'd imagine there's some sort of governmental id check on the pickup end, and that might be susceptible to fraud or just expensive.  Either the end user uses a private key authorization in the BTC case or they are stuck with old mechanisms.
This changes a lot when you have demand for actual Bitcoin in those countries.  For example, it might be easier to buy foreign goods, so they'll want to keep some.

It's reasonable to compare things, lots of things have some similarities.  The key is to figure out why the similarities matter, and why the differences don't matter.
Your "hoarding" argument was fantastic and I think you could have pushed it further.  Imagine all stores and restaurants only took gift cards as payment.  You could only buy giftcards from shareholders of the company, who were given a fixed amount relative to their investment.  That's pretty much an appcoin.  The harder it is to hunt down a shareholder to get a gift card, the more valuable they are, even if the gift cards were denominated in "1 hamburger", instead of dollars.  People would hoard these just because it's a pain to acquire them and you might want to eat.  But change it up by having a machine that allows you to exchange any card at a market rate for cash of every shop with virtually no fee (say a fraction of a penny).  You have no incentive to hoard the cards anymore, you simply buy one outside the store, go in and use it, then walk out.
Also, if you would have known he was going the gift card route, you could have spoken of the unpopularity of gift cards as gifts (from receiving them).  People give them as gifts to avoid being tacky, not because they provide some kind of value.  The going rate for gift cards is substantially below market, and Johnston even admitted (or at least almost admitted it) as much.  People simply do not buy gift cards for themselves unless sold at a discount.
The frequent filer mile comparison is great, and I think one of you caught him on that, asking if he had ever purchased them.  Of course not!  There is one time to purchase them, and that's when they are about to expire and you need enough to redeem them.  No one in their right mind would.  I think you could have attacked that stronger with the gift card by asking if he ever bought gift cards for himself, and it only comes down to "well, this restaurant was offering you $10 in free gift cards if you bought $100, so I bought some.".  Or "If I buy an HEB Gift Card, I can use it to buy gas at an 11 cent discount per gallon".  It pretty much proves they are less valuable.
Another point I wish you would have hit them with harder is how there is no benefit of a network effect from having a service that accepts a special token.  They mention the whole "well, people love to evangelize their terrible investment" argument as why services that use Bitcoin aren't at the level of app-coin token services.  The trivality of forking any Open-Source project that has its own token, and switching that for Bitcoin will destroy any successful service.  Or even another  app-coin that doesn't need as much investment for infrastructure - the profit from investors will simply disappear as copy-cats exist, and there's no reason to use Storj vs. Storj2.0 if one is cheaper than the other.
They did have one good point - the appcoin model is a great business model for raising money.  Which is why they are following that path - it's a great way to get a lot of sucker investors who otherwise wouldn't be allowed to invest in something they can promote, give themselves discounts on the "IPO", then turn it over.  It's Wolf of Wall Street over and over.  They get in first, they dump it off to suckers, then can move onto the next coin while all these projects are in development, and come out ahead without having to do anything other than fleece the sheep.

I think the biggest thing most early adopters forget is that other people don't have the same political motivation, knowledge of the monetary system, or other motivations.  They need it to actually give them value.  There was a huge class of people who entered with greed on the mind exclusively (miners are great of this), or users (silk road customers).  They found value or the possibility of getting in early on something.  There are others I know who see the potential of a speculative rise and don't have any other reason to care, and that's huge.  And when the price rises, it helps so many other things in the ecosystem, including publicity, that it's foolish not to think otherwise.  Unless you have some kind of unique skillset or free time, there's not much else most people can do.

You probably couldn't buy that exact amount with the dollar amount you spent, since the USD price is only divisible to pennies.
Doing the math, this almost surely is the case.  It looks like the exchange rate you got was $363.16 per coin, which comes out exactly to what you got (actually rounded you up as it comes out to .10964643).  So you got a free bit.

There's no way to add a fee to a tx without signing it again (unless the tx was created with some options that allow modification), but you spend it (to yourself) with a fee, and miners have an incentive to include both the fee-less tx and the one with the fee that covers both.
I'm speaking exclusively about how the rules work, nodes can do whatever they want, keeping things for days or not.  Nodes can determine what they do with a perceived double spend (relay or not).  I don't follow all the latest developments of every wallet out there, and I doubt too many actually allow this kind of behavior by default.  The default behavior IIRC is as you describe above, just keep it queued up, and don't relay any other spending of that node.  You could probably connect directly to mining pools and send a transaction direct to them.
I believe there is a patch that some miners might apply that is fee-by-child, that some nodes might use.

And PhD at the high school level makes more sense (although still lol if you get a PhD and are teaching kids unless you absolutely love it, which is still lol to waste your time getting a PhD).
But here's a great example of what teachers really do wrong and why I'm strongly in favor of unschooling:
Here you have a student who expresses an unpopular belief, and rather than making it an educational movement, squashes this unconformity.

The market isn't liquid enough to acquire that many coins on an exchange at "market price".
Someone who wants to acquire a lot of coins would be happy to pay slightly above "market price" since they couldn't otherwise get such coins without moving the market.  Someone who wants to sell a lot of coins would be happy to sell for slightly lower than market price since they couldn't sell them all on an exchange otherwise.  So there's a range of what will be paid.
Since it's an auction, all it takes is one person willing to pay above market to get to that price.

There are more than 2 assets people could get into than USD and Bitcoin.  And even so, it would take a complete collapse of the dollar to even make Bitcoin a more "stable" place to be.  Hell, if any fraction of USD flees for Bitcoin, that by itself would increase instability greatly.  There are hundreds of other places for this fleeing money to go other than Bitcoin as well, many with much longer track records and more security.

Except no one buys coins to spend them at merchants, barring very rare circumstances.  Bitcoin is far inferior for mainstream merchant adoption.  The exception being circumstances where you can't use traditional means or it's very expensive.

Think of it more like a pre-paid debit card in some sense.  Say I set up a service called "BitCard".  You deposit 10,000 bits in your account, which is basically a "joint" account between BitCard and you.  Neither of you can spend Bitcoins out of this without both parties agreeing.  Initially, Bitcard gives you a "refund" transaction that gives you back the full amount back to you to avoid the risk of having your coins locked up forever.  This transaction is post-dated such that it cannot be used for some time, and will be voided if you come up with a new agreement before then.
10,000 bits is big enough that you can pay the transaction fee to get in the block chain and it's no big deal.  So you ship the 10,000 bits to the joint account, and it sits there waiting for you to spend it.  Now lets say you have lots of micro merchants that sell items that cost only a few bits.  It would be inefficient to waste blockchain space just for these tiny transactions.  Now suppose these merchants also partnered with BitCard, such that they have the opposite direction, BitCard has a 10,000 bit payment they lock up with each merchant (with the initial sum going 100% back to BitCard) and updating it as purchases are made, and once it gets filled, the merchants can cash it in (or any other point up to that point).  Any time someone buys a good from them, BitCard will adjust the transaction such that the merchant now gets some of the money in the joint account.  But it's not sent right away, just updated in a transaction that hasn't been set yet.
Probably makes sense to see it in practice:
Alice locks up 10,000 bits with BitCard.
Bob wants to sell a digital download of a songs he recorded for 500 bits per song
Carol accepts microdonations for her blogging.
Alice decides to buy 3 songs from Bob.  She updates a transaction with BitCard to instead give BitCard 1500 bits, and her refund is now 8500.  Then she decides to donate 100 bits to Carol.  So her transaction is updated up to 1600 bits and her refund is 8400.  She continues this process until she spends 7000 bits and decides to complete the transaction batch.  Bitcard then will publish a transaction to the blockchain that gives them 7000 bits, and 3000 back to Alice. She pays two transaction fees (one to fund, one to spend).
On the other end, Bob has 15 different customers buy his music.  BitCard sets up a transaction with 10,000 bits going to themselves, and 0 for Bob.  Every time a customer buys the music, BitCard authorizes the spending of 500 bits to Bob instead of BitCard.  After time has passed, Bob wants his payment, so he submits the 7500 bit transaction to the blockchain.
This system involves little trust, is all off blockchain, and just sends transactions in batches.  Worst case scenario, someone authrorizes a small microtransaction that is not honored by BitCard and they stop doing business with them.
In theory, someone doing a lot of business with one party could just open the channel directly with the other party, and update it any time a "debt" needs to be paid.

If you are new to something and you dive in head first into something like mining without doing your homework, you aren't thinking well.  When I was just getting into Bitcoin, I looked at buy vs. mine, did some basic calculations and it was obvious I had no edge mining.  It did not take much thought to do this.  The fact that miners are incapable of this kind of thought shows they are incapable of acting rationally when it comes to holding/spending coins from mining.
A lot of miners have lucked out due to price increases (which they would have gotten even better returns going long into Bitcoin), but now they haven't had that advantage.

For a merchant, Bitcoin is better than a credit card because it is irrevocable.  This means I am not going to get screwed by fraud or chargebacks.  It allows me to serve markets I might not otherwise have been able to participate in, at an incredible low cost.  I don't have to worry about what a bank finds objectionable or risky.
For a buyer, it allows me a lot more security with a push-based approach than a pull-based credit card.  Whenever I do business with someone with a credit card, I must give up *my* information regarding the purchase.  They have access to my account number.  If they lose it to hackers, I am the one who pays the price of having to reset all of my accounts, fight any fraudulent charges, etc..., not them.  If they are fraudulent and decide to keep billing me with a recurrent payment without giving me the ability to cancel easily (or if I forget to cancel on time), they cannot keep accessing my Bitcoins.  They can only get what I immediately authorize.
Now some of the protections of a credit card are missing.  The advantage here is that I only pay for those protections when I really want them.  I don't need to pay for them for purchases from merchants I trust very well.  There is much less friction in being able to accept payments - I can pay my friends in Bitcoin where I can't really pay them with a credit card.
If Bitcoin is truly advantageous from a cost perspective from merchants, then much of that savings will get passed on to the consumer, or else another merchant will.  So it's not a one-way street.  Basically, you should be comparing Bitcoin to cash, not credit cards.  Bitcoin is superior to cash in that I can transmit it to anyone nearly instantly at almost no cost with no risk of being intercepted.  I can store it easier and more cheaply than cash.  As a merchant, I can accept it without having to worry about employee theft, much like I would with cash. That's the better comparison.

Bad news, their acceptance really doesn't mean much other than it's in their system.  If there's a problem, you'll find out in 2-3 years after you've piled up a few more returns reporting the same stuff, accusing you of owing a lot more money.  They are slow as hell.  I had returns questioned several years down the road, had to dig up old documentation to fight it.  Was a huge pain in the ass.  Don't let this make you overconfident that you did it correctly or that it won't be a huge pain later.  Especially when there is very little clear guidance.  But if you do your best and make every honest effort, you'll at least only be hit with financial penalties instead of jail time.

Historically, a lot of gold was mined and that was currency, so it's hard to even know that for sure.
In the long run, it has a limit of 0% though, so it's really not that big a deal, just that there is going to be more coins.  If you are using or investing in DOGE for long term investment potential, you are doing it wrong.
Anyone legitimately scared of a fad-coin like Doge is the types of people who panic sell on every dip.  I'm glad it has gotten going.  The cryptoworld needs approachable currency that's easy to obtain and play around with.  Bitcoin was the same way for a long period of time, and this is just the next wave of users way of adopting without having to jump through a ton of hoops to get it, but get to feel and experience it.  Anyone who becomes comfortable with any cryptocurrency and does not invest their life savings or do stupid things to get it is going to become an advocate that gives us all more credibility.

You clearly don't understand what I was proposing.  The merchant would not ship if the timelocked transaction was valid.  That is why I propose once the funds are locked into a single account, making a new transaction that invalidates the timelock transaction.
Yes, in this case, it's not a big deal if you have to handshake, unless it's somehow unfeasible to have that communication.  However, this drawback would still exist if you required a refund transaction.
My original use case has nothing to do with this situation.  I was dealing with a futures market, where one party could sit on the signed transaction and not publish it unless he was going to win.  This doesn't make sense in this case.
You didn't illustrate it, as you just simply do not understand what I proposed.  I might have been unclear.

It doesn't matter if someone can buy direct from Dell (which gets dumped immediately anyway), or if they can sell for themselves on exchanges, get fiat, and use.  As long as I can convert Bitcoin to value (e.g. it is relatively liquid), then it doesn't really matter how.  The slight of hand of using merchants as an exchange is simply that, a slight of hand.
The only way Bitcoin retains any value is by ending up with someone who wishes to hold it for a period of time.  When no one wants to hold it and it just moves nearly instantly, it has virtually no value (the coins themselves, not the network).

I'm curious where it is easier to acquire Bitcoins than a credit card of any kind (prepaid, debit, credit, secured credit).  Genuinely curious.
@_date: 2014-09-24 23:30:13
I assume you have never gotten your credit card stolen through identity theft or had a fraudulent charge.  It's a pain.  First, you may be without your card (while the new one is being shipped).  You may need to actually call the credit card companies and deal with it.  You need to be paying close attention to your card to make sure nothing is run up as well.  It's just a hassle.  If you end up with a new card due to fraud or even suspected fraud, you might need to update any recurring payments you have set up, since everything relies on the same number.  At best, it's a few hours of your time getting it right.  From other kinds of identity theft, it can be even worse.  I never have to worry about my card being skimmed as well.  Lastly, I didn't mention this, but it's typically much easier.  If I want to pay something with Bitcoin, I can just copy/paste an address or scan a QR code and press OK.  No personal information typing in, having to dig up my card and expiration and all.
But if you enjoy watching your monthly statement looking for fraudulent charges and trying to remember every detail of every transaction later, go for it.  I've seen cases where waiters have modified tips (again, I either have to keep track of this myself and check up on it later, or just push and never have to worry).  I believe the credit card industry will push to a more "push" friendly method, where you approve amounts explicitly and electronically, a one-time number is generated, and that's what the merchant can get.

Think about this for a second: 
Q: Why do you have dollars to spend to begin with?
A: You must balance the risk of Bitcoin's volatility with it's possibility for appreciation.  This leads you to have a ratio of Bitcoins to Dollars you are willing to hold.  This ratio can change at any point in time based on your net worth, life situation, the price of Bitcoin, world events, etc...
So you have an ideal ratio based on the current situation, since you are a rational investor who is making the best decision he can make.  It now becomes time where you prefer owning product X over $Y worth of savings.  You can spend your dollars.  But now your ratio is screwed!  You have too many Bitcoins for your comfort level, so you would need to sell some Bitcoins into $.
Now this is impractical to always sell a portion of every asset at a perfect ratio on every purchase.  But instead, people tend to square up every so often.  And they will.  So if you hold too much cash, you'll buy a chunk of Bitcoins.  And if you hold too much Bitcoins, you might spend or sell some.
Once owning dollars has no value to you, you only spend Bitcoins, since that's all you have, and the second anyone sends you a dollar, you convert it into Bitcoins (or at least try to spend it as fast as possible).

@_date: 2014-07-20 14:16:04
The idea that it will be "sensible", and can adjust, as what is sensible changes with time is quite flawed.  Market conditions change a lot, and you either need to call in a ton of loans, somehow get a bunch of new deposits, or tell people wishing to withdrawal to pound sand.  There is a direct conflict of on-demand deposits along with loaning that same money out.  If you call it on-demand* deposits (subject to availability), then it's a different function.  Time demand deposits allow you to remove this conflict, where you cannot have a massive change of what is "sensible" at whims, but must play out over a longer period of time.

Saving has tremendous benefits for the economy - namely saving is a way to signal you want to consume in the future over today, allowing assets to be allocated toward productive purposes now to be consumed in the future.  It allows for cheaper investment since fewer goods are being consumed immediately, which allows for assets with long term productive capabilities to be produced.
@_date: 2014-12-22 18:50:12
If you buy immediately, you gain nothing by holding extra Bitcoins.  If you believe, in general, Bitcoin will be worth more than fiat over any time period, holding Bitcoin for some amount of time is the advantage here.  The longer the hold period, the better, of course.
When you instantly rebuy coins, there is no hold period, you are basically purchasing coins on demand.

Anyone concerned with moving up the chain and becomes a teacher is a moron.  Around here, having a masters might mean you get an extra $100 a year.  And either way, it's just more jumping through hoops and time and money more than any kind of actual accomplishment.  Getting a PhD is just hilariously dumb unless you are just trying to become a superintendent or something.  But the fact we even require such level of education for glorified day care workers is even more hilarious.
Yep, Dunning Kruger is a huge factor here along with being threatened by kids who know more than them.  Subconsciously this leads to lashing out at the kids who aren't the ones who just quietly follow directions and instead question the authority of the teacher, especially ones that show themselves to be less knowledgeable than the kids themselves.  Smart people aren't threatened here, and they use it as an opportunity to learn.  Dumb people are immediately threatened and must "put them in their place", rather than be exposed by everyone else as a moron.

My comment was based on the assumption that security was not an issue with the sidechain, which is the biggest drawback by far.  If there's actually a 2-way peg that's safe (huge assumption), this is a much better situation in that users that don't care can just stick with the most secure chain and not worry about losing out on speculative value.

1)  Agree.
2) Lack of volume is primarily due to Goxing risk of leaving anything on an exchange.  It's only starting to get big enough to get reputable exchanges into the mix that aren't a threat to steal your money.
3)  Agree.  The focus on coffee shop spending is silly.  Use Bitcoin where it is best served, particularly in previously costly transactions rather things that can be handled trivially now.
4) Mass adoption will remove these fluctuations.  Bigger market and better exchanges will solve this problem, along with the real ability to short.
5) Agree
6) Agree
Good post.  I think you have put a bit of the cart before the horse and just aren't used to seeing things in the super early adopter stage, and that this is normal for this stage.  The key is to get past that.  We don't need mainstream adoption.  We need infrastructure improvements and many other things before we even get close to mainstream adoption.  I want to see a great business adoption use case where it actually is beneficial (remittance anyone?!) where the users are not even aware Bitcoin is used.  That will happen far before mass adoption.

Agreed.  It's a sideshow for idiots.  It only makes sense after broader adoption occurs for other reasons (where it actually gives substantial advantages, not operates at a slight disadvantage).  People fail to realize that distributed consensus generally is more expensive (but possibly more secure) than centralized systems.  This will limit the number of significant edges it has.  These will be applications where trust is tough, censorship is prevalent, or access to other means is highly limited.  Anything other than attacking issues with those problems is a waste of time right now.

Think about it this way.  You have a 1024 sided dice.  That's a lot of sides!  Roll it twice and write down the rolls you get.  That's 1,048,576 combinations, but it's easy to write down 2 numbers.  Now roll it 10 more times.  That is an enormous number.  Numbers are hard to error check against and it's easy to make a mistake, and getting one number wrong would be catastrophic.  So instead we replace each number with a word.  There are 1024 words possible to choose from in the electrum dictionary, and each one starts with 3 unique characters, so you can't really make a mistake.  This creates a very long number that is easier to keep track of but is big enough no one can guess it.
There are some extra pieces of information that are used to validate that it's correct so you cannot just get one word wrong and have a valid value.  It will tell you there is  a problem instead.

When the value of your Bitcoins drops to $900, you are forced to sell all your Bitcoins to pay your loan back.  That price depends on what you bought them for, and how many you have, and how leveraged you are.  You can see how it's a cascading effect, whereas one margin call may cause another and may cause another, almost instantly.  
There is some risk to the person making the loan, as there may not be any buyers at the price needed to pay him back in full.  Say the market is very thin, with very few buyers sitting waiting.  The price may drop 10%, making the margin call happen, but when he sells, there's not enough liquidity to even give him $900.  In this case, the person making the loan may be SOL, or may have some kind of insurance.  The trick is, this is going to cause lots of margin calls to occur, and making the insurance pay out huge or those loaning get screwed.  So be careful when you loan your coins for margin traders, they may not be able to pay you back!  Some places offer great interest on deals like this, but it's easy to neglect the risk.  Or the insurance that you thought you had gets wiped out as everyone else also gets hit, and they cannot pay everyone back.

Why would you spend millions of dollars on something that only serves a very small valued market?  Why would you buy a Trezor to protect $100 worth of Bitcoins?  If all the Bitcoins in the world are only worth $1M, would it make any sense spending $100K developing a product to protect them?  Or to buy them?
Also, raising prices gives early adopters more money to invest towards those efforts that otherwise would not happen.  Roger Ver isn't going to have the kind of capital to invest if Bitcoin is worth $1 instead of $1000.

Trying to stick the Bitcoin model on the existing economy is dumb, barring a few cases (remittance).  Find new things where you can ONLY do it with Bitcoins.  Make it so people need to have them or want to have them.  The rest will follow.  Once people want Bitcoins, you will find people who accept them as payments, merchants will adopt and can pay suppliers in Bitcoins who can pay wages in Bitcoins.  Saying we need merchant adoption is like saying we need to build roads so someone will invent cars.

Actually now that I thought about this more, the bigger news will be when the second site accepts it.  At that point, you'll see an incentive to hold Bitcoins as a player.  A player wants the ability to switch between multiple sites quickly.  In the distant past, when I played a lot, this meant just leaving a good chunk of money on Neteller, and being able to reallocate as needed.  It still took a while to cash out of sites (and likely still will, just for security reasons, they don't want to send money unless they are sure it's legit), and going in and out of Neteller was slow, so you kept money in Neteller.  The same problem exists now with Bitcoin - it's still reasonably slow to get in and out (exchanges), or costly (ATMs).  So users who want to maintain a bankroll may very well keep it in Bitcoins to be able to convert back and forth.  This also allows players to keep a much smaller bankroll on a site since conversion is easy and cheap.
On the other hand, when wallets start offering USD holdings (I believe Coinbase is doing this now?) that you hold in USD and immediately convert when you are ready to play.
The other side effect is a lot of people that just become comfortable with the idea of Bitcoin and using it, and start using it to settle debts between each other.  Poker players by nature are risk averse, and if they see the possibility of a good return on Bitcoin, they may just decide to hold where they wouldn't have looked at it in the past.

The incentives must hold true to make it such that the miner does not benefit more by doing things that are detrimental to Bitcoin.
There are benefits to pools outside of reducing variance.  Larger pools can actually increase their payouts with the same hashrates due to efficiency, "greedy mining", and being able to reach more nodes very quickly when blocks are found to reduce orphan rates.

It's the exact opposite, we understand exactly how it works.  No one is buying Bitcoin to dump on merchants to replace with fiat, when they can spend with fiat to begin with.

Let me try to explain it more clearly.  A and B each send a TX to a multisig address and each gets a refund post-dated in the future before committing to send.  Barring tx malleability, these funds each arrive at some point.  Once both funds are there, another tx is created out of those two outputs and sent to the same address.  This is broadcast before the timelock expires, thus invalidating the refunds.
Trust me, I'm fully aware how the blockchain works and transaction works.  I have implemented this exact scheme before and put it into the blockchain.
Calling it trustless is a misnomer. You basically have a better incentive, not a trustless system.  Though you have the serious game of chicken problem where whoever appears to be the most stubborn will win more than his fair share.  Trust absolutely is needed.

We need minimizing risk on transactions without waiting in some cases, which there are many solutions proposed besides 0-confirm transactions.

Spam is arbitrary.  The idea is you limit a resource to an arbitrary limit so that it prevents growth beyond an acceptable level for most nodes.
Block size prevents it by not having nodes have to download huge blocks and store huge blocks.  You are right, there's no incentive to store a 100 TB blockchain unless you are mining or really really interested in security.

In essence, they can do it now since the interest rate they get from the Fed is so low.  The Fed lets them borrow money virtually for free to pump into loans.  The idea is to throw a ton of money into the economy so that all this new money is bidding for goods and services and stocks and that makes the nominal value go up and makes it look like we are doing better than we are.  This benefits debtors (which the USGovt is a huge one) since it devalues the currency, and gives the illusion of growth (see the stock market).  Savers who are not speculating in these bubble assets get punished heavily.

It's tough because current adopters who are hugely invested and got most of their wealth from the price rising are not really generating more wealth and instead are enjoying it.

I have no idea what it is, what the point of it is, how it could be used, other than "wow, random free internet bux for people".
There's nothing about "calling" them colored coins, that's an implementation of blockchain based assets.  Appcoin does not imply colored coins.  Appcoin has nothing to do with it.  An Appcoin is a token that is redeemable for some distributed service, usually presold to enrich IPO creators and the founders.

Though I do see it could be useful in situations where you need to transfer funds between banks without waiting for confirmation or reversibility.

How does some random merchant accepting Bitpay Dollars drive acceptance?  "Look, now you can buy this currency jumping through hoops and spendable at 25 places instead of 20 now retains its value even worse than Zimbabwe Dollars!"
I hear of these theoretical people who are on the fence until some random third rate merchant accepts Bitpay Dollars, and then they are going to jump on board, but they are about as common as a mermaid or unicorn in reality.

You believe that Bitcoin will go up in the future.  You have $100 you want to invest.  You could buy $100 worth of Bitcoins, or you could use your $100 as collateral to buy $1000 worth of Bitcoins (10x margin).  The problem is, if you buy $1000 worth of Bitcoins, you could lose $1000, and only have $100 to pay the person you owe money to!  So once the value of your Bitcoins drop $100, you are forced to sell, losing everything you put in, but the person who loaned you money doesn't lose anything.
If a lot of people are trading on margin, this can cause a chain reaction.  When the price drops 10%, all the 10x margin traders have to sell.  This means the price gets pushed down even more, which might make the 9x margin traders have to sell.  Which pushes the price down and makes the 8x margin traders have to sell.  And so forth.  And if it gets severe enough, a huge crash occurs, almost instantly on an exchange, since everyone is having to sell to cover their losses.  This happens very quickly, before people can react and start buying at the low prices.  This is why you'll see a huge flash crash then a rocket back up, where everyone wants to buy at the cheap price and is racing each other.  However, a lot of the damage is done.

Sucks for the CC companies, but really besides places that you have a CC saved, it's a minimal hassle.  Charges get reversed with minimal effort.
Plus the entire system is switching to a more push-based with things like Apple Wallet creating one-time CC numbers.  It's not that difficult of a problem to solve without turning the world on its head.  And it's a huge pain in the ass to redo everything.
But the whole concept of putting a CC online was just so foreign back in 1995-1996, you had to think it was insane.  Even with the stories now, it's still no big deal for the vast majority of people.  Hell, a lot of those hacking issues aren't even from online payments but POS systems.

You have more hope than I for fellow Americans, unless it really hits it.  We have fudged inflation numbers that people don't even believe it's happening.  Compared to other currencies, USD is probably one of the better in terms of inflation, and Bitcoin will be very unstable (up and down), and most people are willing to sacrifice some expectation to reduce volatility, especially when it comes to their livelihood.   I'm only putting money into Bitcoin that I wouldn't be upset if I lost 80% of it, even though I think it has a great chance of doubling (or more!) in the next few years.  I'm not going to dump so much in that I am screwed if it does drop a bunch.

I agree that it would be an interesting model.  A forum where anyone who wants to post pays 10 bits per post (or some other amount).  You end up with 8 votes for that, which you can distribute.  Or you can use one as a downvote! A self-moderating forum.  Perhaps if enough of the same posts get downvoted, you get that vote back!
You could get a small number of votes for lurking as well.  The better posters will in theory end up with more than they put in, essentially getting paid for contributing.  The worst posters get culled.
Now would the system work in practice?  Too many downvotes are given out for disagreement rather than just bad posting.  But its an interesting idea.  And yes, it would add up, and it would be an anti-spam mechanism.

It's not meant to be an insult.  You clearly are a Bitcoin noob.  We all were once.  It's nothing to be ashamed of, you ask questions and you learn.

It's network latency, not scrypt, that's the bottleneck.  You are much likely to have two blocks solved at nearly the same time with smaller confirmation times, which will result in a fork a great deal of the time.  It will get resolved usually, but that opens the door to having a double-spend on the two different forks.

They certainly will work, a buyer who deposits 3BTC just to get back 3BTC is an idiot.  He only refunds the 3BTC in case the seller does not put up 1 BTC collateral. 
You can also have a handshaking process of unsigned inputs and merging into a single transaction as well, although you still end up in states where one user has a fully signed transaction and the other does not.  Whether he can use this as an attack might not be important in this use case (it was an attack in my original use case for it).
The ratios are unimportant for the technical feasibility of this.  It may not even be a ratio, but simply a reasonably large enough penalty to incentivize spending it.  That being said, game theory comes into play where someone can use leverage against the other to get more than their fare share at the end.  It's a game of chicken in some ways, as one party would rather get *something* back rather than nothing, although depending on his levels of spite, he might prefer nothing.
Practically, this may not be worth it in most cases, and 3rd party escrow still might be better.

The problem is you are making a lot of assumptions (for whatever reason) about the law in the US.  There's a lot of nonsense on here from naive koolaid drinkers that probably implanted this into your head.
There's a lot of tax laws that you might find surprising.  For example, if I offer to mow your lawn and you decide to give me a haircut in return, those events are taxable.  Do people report this stuff?  Typically not for small things.
You are right that "Bitcoin cannot be governed or touched", that doesn't mean actors that can be governed or touched do not have the laws apply to them.  I'm curious why you started making these assumptions, which, to anyone with any life experience, appear to be extremely naive and simplistic.  Not to be bashing you, it's just quite strange.

Biggest reason for the drop was the fraudulent rise last year.  The price was completely out of balance with reality due to the Gox bugs that let hackers buy coins with no real money, inflating the price, which soon reflected on other markets due to arbitrage, til Gox shut down and left everyone holding bags.  This was simply unwinding what never should have occurred.

Yep, basically everything we've been seeing for the past 6 months in price drops multiplied.  Every potential institutional investor who missed the boat on the rise has got to be super excited of the idea of having early adopters dump, dump, and dump to them all while feeling proud about how they are "helping Bitcoin" by giving them to a merchant who doesn't give any care for Bitcoin, just wants the fiat, just so they can have the Amazon seal of approval.  If Amazon announces, I wait for the small rise from people getting excited about it, thinking it will make a difference, then get out.  Wait a few months until the coins have been dumped and the price plummets, then get back in.
@_date: 2014-11-04 15:52:50
Agree 100%, and the crowd tends to have no way of seeing things through other peoples eyes ("what do you mean it's controversial that the USD is going to collapse in the next 5 years?!").  It's this fanaticism and lack of grounding that makes a lot of gold, something people get from only being in an echo chamber and considering anyone who disagrees to be a troll.
Many uses of Bitcoin are trying basically solutions in search of a problem.  This is why replacing traditional payment methods is so boring to me.  It's not advantageous at all.  Stick to what Bitcoin has a huge edge on, where people actually can get benefits without having to be sold on the philosophical arguments, and you have success.  Of course, a lot of people think that its ability to use for those purposes actually is a bug not a feature, though.

You can do that today.  Create a new address (A).  Send coins there.  Then create a transaction out of that address to another address (B) where you hold the private key and set the lock time to be whenever you want to use it in the future.  Destroy the private key for A, and keep the transaction.

Whether or not you run a node is irrelevant.  You don't even need coins.  You simply don't accept them or you do.  A forked Bitcoin is no different than something like Litecoin or Dogecoin.  If I am relying on a web wallet and they decide to instead support some forked version of Bitcoin, barring them holding coins for me, I take my private keys and go to the network I want to be on and they can pound sand.

The USD also has value because you need it to pay taxes and it is forced to be used by legal tender laws.  The rest is nonsense, as you could just get dollars seconds before you need them on Forex, buy oil, and whoever wants to sell you the oil divests of oil instantly.  There simply is not enough oil out there being sold that can offset that velocity.
Now with Bitcoin, that kind of velocity does not exist in the current form, but you are correct, having something that can be only be bought in Bitcoins would help... oh wait, that already existed and helped bootstrap the currency several years ago, called Silk Road.
Discounts would help some, but people could just get Bitcoins immediately before spending, and it doesn't do much.
Now this all refers to first world places, but with crappy banking systems, you'll likely see this benefit come into play faster.  If you are in China, and want to purchase a Dell computer, you are going to pay out the ass in local currency, be unable to get a foreign credit card, and can pay using Bitcoins and save a huge amount.

Miners are far less than 1/2 of the network and are replaceable.  They serve at the whim of the nodes.  The second they provide less security than another option, they are dropped.  Miners offer a value proposition - securing the block chain at a cost of rewards.  The second that value proposition isn't worth it, a new set of miners will be used.

The miners contract is contingent on being able to secure the network.  If they cannot do this, then their contract is null and void.
If a 51% attack is successful, it won't prove anything about block chain systems in general, only that specific case.  When Luke Dashjr attacked alt coins, did it somehow prove Satoshi wrong?  All it did was prove that those coins were not secure.  Every network, every possibility must be disproven before Satoshi is disproven.  If the current algorithm was set up in a way that the NSA could easily create hashes but the general public could not, and it was 51% attacked, it wouldn't prove Satoshi wrong, it would just prove that algorithm to be insecure.  If two large pool operators went insane and 51% attacked for a little, then regained their sanity, it wouldn't disprove much.  It would just show the degree of security currently there.
Security is not black and white.  There are shades of gray.  There are things that are more and less secure.  More security is not always better.  There's a saying - if you have never missed a flight, you spend too much time at the airport.  If your coin hasn't been attacked, you probably are spending too much on security.
Keep in mind in the event of an attack, there are many unprofitable miners who have Bitcoin interests, who would mine at a loss for a while to withstand an attack to protect the value of their investments.  And the idea that changing an insecure algorithm somehow is game over is ludicrous.  It would be game over for those who are heavily invested in custom hardware.  It would be game on for everyone else who is able to participate in both mining and using Bitcoin.  Unless it was attacked again.  Which gets to my point, you need to not only make the first attack and continue it at great expense, you must thwart all reactions and continue on.  Present miners get hurt, but that's the cost of doing business.

I've done this on a few rare occasions and it makes sense then.
1)  Private sales of large value items.  I'm taking cash every time here, not trusting some random to give me a check that may or may not clear and may or may not be authentic.  He's paying me in cash (and meeting me in a bank where I can get it validated immediately).
2)  Casinos.  Can't use a CC for this without paying sky-high cash advance fees.  So I would bring cash and it's not that big a deal.
3)  International Travel.  Get crushed by transaction fees here.
4)  Discount for paying cash.  Sometimes this happens, especially for larger amounts, where the merchant will give you a decent discount if you pay with cash.

@_date: 2014-06-10 16:54:35
A continued 51% attack would be a war of attrition.  Knocking Bitcoin down only to see it back up and operational again, and having to reinvest in a new set of hardware to perform attacks becomes a battle of wills.  Yes, it may kill some ASIC investments.  I view it as no different than an SHA-256 weakness that needs to be corrected.  It's a risk as being a miner, that the algorithm may change when there is no other choice.
Closed loop Bitcoin economy is completely irrelevant, and incorrect.  Electricity remains a primary cost, and is not a closed loop. 
Miners that provide a network that can be 51% attacked are not providing a secure network, thus no value.  Remember, we are talking about a scenario where we are stuck using an algorithm that can be attacked, that somehow you are claiming the interests of these miners should somehow be considered at all.  They are irrelevant.
As for POS, I would consider it a temporary crutch until an alternative can be reached.  So you live with some centralization for a small period of time to avoid a complete catastrophe.  Pragmatism wins.
Yes, something happens, and then you change algorithms.  Sorry, miners, but China will have to keep playing wack-a-mole and realize it's futile.  Much cheaper to just execute a few known users and make examples of them.  That does far more damage for Bitcoin in China.
You act like *the current miners* is the same as *all possible miners*.  This is simply untrue.  The system relies on miners.  The system does not rely on *the current miners* at all.  They are replaceable.  The second they become useless, they will be replaced, like an overpaid union worker, by bringing in scabs.
Sorry you wasted so much money on mining equipment.

2% will get you plenty of regular payments, with 120 blocks a day found, you'll have a .3% chance of not finding a block within 2 days.
You are right, it would be best to have the current system make pools.  People could configure to see what kind of variance they will take or the max number of contributors they want in with them or something like that, and just build up separate chains for each group.  It could be instantly reconfigured for every block as well.

I trust Coinbase as much as you can reasonably trust a company.  I don't trust the regulatory bodies that can go after Coinbase on a whim.  If their TOS changes, your coins might be stuck until you fill out the appropriate paperwork/submit to the appropriate anal probe/etc...  I don't think Coinbase is run by malicious, evil, or incompetent people.  It's just that they are subject to a lot of regulation or pressures that could negatively impact you and prevent you from being able to access your coins when you want them.  Coinbase is nice for me as a temporary way to get or take coins out.
It's not even unlikely, they started locking down people who started using gambling sites that are likely legal, but afraid of attracting a court case to prove it.

It's not that you need words.  Let's just say there are 10,000 albums you choose from.
If you randomly pick 1, it's 10,000 choices, so it's just over 13 bits of entropy.  If you pick 2, it's 100,000,000, or just over 26 bits of entropy.  5 gives you 66 bits of entropy, which is pretty weak.  This assume repeats of albums, which rules out some choices.  To get anything realistically tough, you'd need 10 albums or so.  Or a bigger data set of what you are going for.  And you shouldn't arbitrarily choose them,  you establish a list ahead of time, and then use a good source of randomness to generate which items you choose from that list.

Think of it as an "alt-coin" on top of Bitcoin.  In many cases, it will represent a centrally held asset, like 1USD in an account.  Anyone who presents that 1USDCoin would be entitled to 1USD.
Think about how this could work with exchanges - you have various banks take deposits and issue their own coins representing assets.  You transfer them to an exchange, and trade.  Each bank has their own coin that could be exchanged for crypto.  When you want fiat, you exchange the fiatcoin for the bankcoin of your choice (which may or may not be at the same rate!), and then cash it out at your local branch.

If it was unreasonable, the business could refuse taking credit cards.  Turns out, it's not that bad a deal for them in most cases, as cash has its own issues.  It's very easy for workers to steal.  It's a pain to deposit every night and you risk getting robbed.  It's not cost-free.  And most merchants pay fairly minimal fees in this case.  Otherwise, they'd be happy to offer a discount.  But it turns out, it doesn't really save them much to use Bitcoin, especially when you have to add in training for something no one will use.
The business makes the choice of what to accept and what to not accept.  They accept things that make business sense and don't when they don't.  If one payment method was really that superior, they'd bend over backwards to accept it and encourage its use.  Strangely, they do not do this.

Visa could theoretically give Amazon 0% if it made Visa more used in other environments.  Say Amazon exclusively took Visa, then it might be worth it for Visa to charge 0%, and make up for it when people who have to get Visa cards spend elsewhere.
Of course, you have no clue about confidential agreements between Amazon and Visa.  We are just speculating.  But they hold pretty large negotiating power as the world largest retailer that accepts credit cards, and losing them would be dreadful for Visa.

PayPal solved a problem that simply did not have a solution in its day.  The vast majority of people who are willing and able to purchase online have a solution involving credit cards.  Merchant adoption at this point is merely a way to avoid exchanges when people who already adopted Bitcoins for other reasons want to reduce their holdings in Bitcoin.  That being said, having a reputable business accepting them is always a good PR move, since it moves the conversation away from "those wackos who buy drugs with that digital currency" to being something more legitimate in their minds.

Yes and no.  Personally, that's how I am investing on it - that it WILL get adopted for other purposes and solve problems that are interesting (not this boring merchant adoption crap).  I think it will solve new problems that haven't been attempted yet, rather than just applying a solution that might not even be better onto an existing system.
Now there are plenty of others who don't even believe in Bitcoin long term, but believe that other people will, and want to get in before them.  There's nothing wrong with this viewpoint, either.

Acquiring Bitcoins with CC/fiat then going into a merchant, then right back into fiat isn't going to be as cheap as just staying in fiat the whole time.  So there won't really be lower fees.  Traditional payments just are not very disruptive of an area for Bitcoin to enter.  Where it will shine is opening up new markets, where such payments weren't really possible before (reaching those without access to CCs/bank accounts), funding things banks are frowning upon or controlling, escaping capital controls, etc...
People will respond to incentives, but there needs to be one.  Does Overstock even offer a discount for using Bitcoin?  The only incentive I see is "support Bitcoin".  That and "Bitcoin is the only way to buy XYZ".

There is no reason to adopt for the vast majority out there.
Right now we have
* ideological adoption - people who want the idea of Bitcoin to succeed and grow based on fundamental properties it has
* opportunistic adoption - people who adopt Bitcoin because it serves some unique purpose (funding a gambling site, buy drugs, etc...)
* speculative adoption - people who think that adoption will be greater in the future, therefore more valuable.
Time to look at where adoption stages are.  
As for ideological, I think we are close to the peak in developed world.  People who are attracted to the ideas of Bitcoin have already heard of it and have gotten in or decided to not get involved.
Opportunistic is an area that can have growth, although there have been virtually no developments in this area, and a lot of people avoiding this due to things like Silk Road busts.  Something like Pokerstars adopting would help here.  Bitcoin needs to be able to solve a problem MUCH better than alternatives to get here.  This could work in places with garbage currencies, wealth protection from governments seizing assets, etc...  This is largely non-existent in the US.
Speculative adoption is still in fairly early stages.  It's still fairly difficult to get and secure coins.  Lots of people might want to speculate but not worry about the details themselves.  It's too small for bigger investment to get in.  Room for growth.  Areas like improved services and security certainly helps this case.
 is spot on - until Bitcoin makes someones life better, the vast majority won't adopt.  It's too volatile for them to want to speculate and most people aren't going to adopt on ideology.

Miners do need financial incentive.  The trouble is when that incentive is insufficient to secure the network.  A new algorithm is the only alternative.  This isn't something users should change lightly, and only should be a last resort.  It is possible SHA-256 is cracked or sufficiently weakened.  That doesn't mean we should continue to use an algorithm just to make miners feel better.
50% miners is arbitrary way to define it.  Miners provide some value for the network.  The network of users provides some value for the network.  One can be replaced much easier than the others.  If Bitcoin switched to something like Scrypt, and all the users were on board but none of the miners, life would go on.  If you took all the users of Bitcoin out and just started with the mining network, how fast would that deteriorate?  That's a pretty good proof which side of the equation is more important.
Getting the miners back isn't that important.  Getting miners is important.  It's silly to think that the set of miners we have today is the only set that exists.  Most miners must enter mining with a short-term mindset anyway, and a miner that becomes useless after 6 months instead of a year hurts, but isn't catastrophic.
In your scenario, with the bottoming out, only becomes an issue when every algorithm possible comes under attack, and continuously.  People do not lose coins in such scenarios.  It would be pretty harmful, but you have a last known good ledger, and a sufficient number of people would agree on what the last known good block was before the attack.
I know plenty of POS's issues.  That's why I classify it as a last resort only after all other options.
If you aren't interested in fantasyland, why do you continue to harp on this sustained 50%+1 attack nonsense and worlds where miners are far more relevant than reality.

My (blind) guess would be as follows:
1)  They have a rate they convert Bitcoins to dollars based on exchanges for consumers.  If they can find a way to get someone to pay a premium for the coins, they can take that as profit.  Investors wanting to buy large amounts of coins might pay a slight premium for this.
2)  Their business plan consists of holding Bitcoins and using the increase in value to be their profit center.  Right now, keeping prices low by stimulating people to dump coins on the market can keep the price low while they acquire out of the profits from above.  Bitcoin either succeeds and they become very wealthy just out of Bitcoins, far more than any actual profit from fees, or it blows up and their business is worthless anyway.

Take this example for how spending money in the real world works vs. Bitcoin.  I've taken some liberties to simplify for the beginner, so experts, bear with them.
I go to spend cash at a store.  I have several bills in my wallet.  Each have some value associated with it.  I might have a $100 bill, 5 $1 bills, 2 $20 bills, etc...  I find something I want to purchase at the store.  It costs $133.  I don't have $133 exactly to give to the cashier, so I combine my $100, 2 $20, and 3 $1 bills to the cashier.  The cashier then gives me back a $10 bill, and puts the rest into the register.
Bitcoin works mostly this way, although there are some subtle differences.  Bitcoin is capable of making bills of *any* size.  I could create a 100BTC "note", a .0000001BTC "note", I could create a 9.1235BTC "note".  Your wallet contains all of these "notes".  When you wish to spend some of them on a transaction, you do it the same way.  Say I wish to spend 0.16BTC.  I look in my wallet, I see a .01BTC note, a 9.2BTC note, and a few others.  I can't just send the 9.2  BTC note to the sender, he'd need to give me change.  But Bitcoin has a way to "convert" notes into other notes.  You can combine as many as you'd like and produce new bills (so long as they add up to what you put in).  So in this case, I'll just take the 9.2 BTC note and split it into two parts - 9.04 and .16.  In the process of creating new bills, I actually assign ownership of it to who I want to transfer it to.  This uses the public key of the recipient.  Now, only he can spend it in the future.  The 9.04 bill left, I want to give it back to myself.  So I put my own public key on it so I can keep spending it.
In your case, you broke the change into two spots.  Why this happened, it's not clear.  Something about how blockchain.info split your change decided to do this.  But it doesn't matter, it's no different than the cashier giving me 2 $5 bills as change rather than 1 $10 bill.

I go to a farmers market and there are 5 guys selling eggs.  They each have 10 dozen eggs, and there is no one else selling eggs for the next 5 counties, and the eggs have to be sold that day.  What price will they get for their eggs compared to the same market with the same customers if they had 1000 dozen eggs?  This is basic economics.
No, hoarding is good.    Hoarding is a sign that you are having something valuable and won't easily part with it.  You don't (typically) hoard things that are worthless.  You hoard things you feel are valuable or will be more valuable in the future.

Do you really think much changes when there is one pool at 51% vs. 2 pools at say 30%?  I would be more worried of two large but less threatening pools.  The ability to coerce 2 operators vs. one is not a huge difference, and that assumes the two pools actually have different operators.  A malicious pool operator would split resources between different pools to appear to be weaker.
I'm not trying to argue centralization of mining isn't an issue (it is), but rather that not much really changed recently.  Perhaps you could argue that any faith in the community to self-police and switch pools on potential threats is diminished.

Yes, if you think the price is going down, holding Bitcoins is dumb.  Replenishing Bitcoins when you expect the price to drop is even dumber.

Node is a very clear term.  Miners are almost always nodes, or at least will connect directly to one.  A node simply means an entity that uses the Bitcoin protocol to communicate with other nodes.  This has a wide variety of node types (SPV, full node, miners, etc...).
Right now there is a lack of incentive in running a full node, as defined as having the entire blockchain and being able to serve it up, along with relaying transactions, as how do you prove you are operating one?  The simplest answer is you can get paid any time you answer a request from another node.  Nodes could then operate as services to entities that do not want to have the full blockchain and get paid for these services, possibly using a micropayment channel.  This would offset the costs of operating a node, and nodes that are able to provide the most value will get paid the most.

Listen to Peter Todd on this topic, he explains it very well why big pools gain an advantage here they otherwise wouldn't through economies of scale.
Each added sidechain you wish to merge mine has a cost to process transactions and validate.  The bigger you are, the more of those costs you can absorb (fixed cost vs. variable revenue based on your size).  Therefore the large pools will always have an edge here as they will be able to handle more side chains, therefore increasing revenue for participants.

The trajectory can be exponential and still be super small.  That's how starting with a small amount of users means when it's exponential.  The general public doesn't care?  Because such a small minority has Bitcoins.  If any significant portion of the population had Bitcoins in any significant amount (say $50 each for 1% of the world's population), we'd have a much higher price.
People may care about the problems (but not even that much, because they keep doing the same things) but they won't view Bitcoin as the answer.  The vast majority of people still view it as some kind of ponzi scheme at worst or nerd money at best.

Looking at the transaction feed tells you not as much.  I have moved transactions around almost without care because it was so cheap.  If it cost a little, I'd still get the same usefulness out of Bitcoin, but I might cut transactions by 5x.
It doesn't stop people from using Bitcoin, it stops people from using it for trivial usages.  Bitcoin does not solve problems right now, so it's not like it prevents any of that from going on, and if 5 cents isn't enough value to solve a problem, there's no way Bitcoin was that valuable for them anyway.

3) There was a reasonable approach that would meet all needs on the horizon (Hint: There is not).

1) is actually a feature not a bug.  Money is not productive by itself.  Saving it for later allows prices now to drop so that investment is cheaper and also signals that you will be able to gain money from people who will spend later.  This signals to invest and actually grows an economy through increasing productive capacity rather than throwing away resources now for current desires.
2)  This will signal not taking debt (aka borrowing from the future production) for non-productive means.  Oh noes, people won't get into debt slavery.  How horrible (for the bankers).
3)  On an adopted currency, the only way value does down with a fixed asset is if productivity increases or population increases.  If productivity increases, wages should keep up with that productivity gains.  Someone who gains productivity at average rates will not see their wages drop.  Someone who gains productivity at an above average rate will still see gains.  Someone who gains productivity increase at a below average rate will see their nominal wages drop, although it will still allow more purchasing power than before.
Basically, deflationary currencies are bad news for bankers and big debtors (governments).  No wonder why their shills argue so vehemently against it.  The key argument they love to throw is that deflation is associated with bad economic times.  This is true in inflationary debt-based economies because you end up with business cycles of boom and bust, where booms happen where people think they are investing in productive assets due to the ease of acquiring money (aka inflation), but all of the calculations people make are incorrect since their costs increase having to compete with everyone else making correct decisions on the individual level.  This leads to a bust cycle with debts going bad which decreases the money supply.  But he has the cause and effect backwards.  Saying deflation causes depressions is like saying that umbrellas cause the rain.

Blocks only exist after being mined.  There are other spam prevention measures as well, many transactions are not even relayed by the network even though they are valid.
You are getting it for the most part - there is contention for the 1MB of space, which will generally go to the highest fee paying txs.  Anyone wishing to use the scarce resource now must compete with everyone else, as there is only a limited amount of space.  You cannot just dump transactions arbitrarily without paying a price (assuming there is contention).  Think of it like a cap-and-trade system for pollution.  Say there is some societal-optimal level of pollution that can occur.  You don't just let everyone pollute because it harms everyone.  So you set a cap, and people bid for the permits to "pollute".  1MB is deemed an acceptable level of burden for full nodes, and the "biding" is transactions that are submitted to miners, who prioritize by fees.

This makes no sense.  That's the definition of stable, keeping the price relatively constant over time.


And driving the price to the "correct value" sooner rather than later is what speculators do.


Except everything.  And I didn't know currencies were "commodities".
Either you have an unusual definition of speculator or just have no clue what you are talking about.


Bitcoin is just as useful if it is used as a unit of account or not.  What people use as a unit of account is irrelevant.  If I accept Japanese Yen for my product, but change the price daily based on the exchange rate to USD, does it make the Yen any less of a currency?


What if you could see the future and saw that it *was* going to be useful in the future in the ways you imagine.  You see it is *more* useful in the future than it is now.  By taking a good now and moving it to the future, you are smoothing things out through time.  This is the job of the speculator.  This drives the future value to the present, thus making everything you want happen.  Without the speculators, it would never be able to take off.
But apparently you read one too many blog posts railing against evil speculators and have your mind made up.

Decentralization is almost always more expensive that centralization (from a cost perspective).  However, monopolistic practices can make it more expensive for the consumer.  I do want to get a better understanding of how venues deal with places like Ticketmaster - if they provide a service but charge no fee (just get it from the consumer), then they might not have a strong incentive to switch.  Likewise, digital tickets could exist with centralization (just trade through the venue).  One possible advantage I could see is if you had atomic transfers of tickets with Bitcoins.  That way if someone does try a double-spend, your Bitcoins basically get refunded to you.
Seems like Bitcoin conferences are a good target market for something like this getting started, but I can see why they wouldn't want to allow resale.
It seems like this has to get sold to the venue/issuer, and I'm just failing to find a good elevator pitch for them on why it would be a good idea or what problem it solves.

I think a lot of people are missing the big picture, where this could really help adoption.  The transfer of fiat into Bitcoins is expensive and slow right now.  By putting the USD layer on top of Bitcoin, you make that process much easier.  You increase liquidity of exchanges without having to wire money.

No.  What matters is how long someone mines on a different block than your own, and if another mining node validates another block at the same height as yours faster than yours (because yours was too slow to get there), he'll choose the other guys, making yours more likely to get orphaned.

I view it as an opportunity.  The Bitcoin ecosystem is immature and fragile right now.  It needs to strengthen.  When there is pain, there is opportunity.  Where there is high costs, there is potential profit for innovation.  The reason this stuff does not happen now is because there is no potential gain.  This is why kicking the can down the road is dangerous.  Let's feel the pain now, while those who actually are into Bitcoin because they LIKE it and WANT it to succeed make up the majority rather than those who don't care and just are in it because it serves some need.
@_date: 2015-05-23 22:21:32
The attack was entirely on why Gavin brings up variance as if it somehow wipes out the advantage gained in this scenario.
Where are Gavin's numbers accounting for costs?  What is the margin of these miners?
As for my numbers - you don't get to just throw out random guesses and say "well, disprove it!"  I called bullshit, because it is clearly bullshit and he's not accounting for a very important factor in the equation.
Gavin's "numbers" do nothing to show the profitability.  I see nothing that accounts for cost, which is simply missing in his arguments.
So, the automatic dismissal of .3% as not significant is bunk.  The onus is on him to show it is actually somehow a meaningless difference.
@_date: 2015-05-23 01:57:10
You are mistaking an edge for variance.  Vegas may have a .5% edge at blackjack with significant variance, but if they gave up that edge, it would make a huge difference on profits.
A miner giving up .3% on average will affect profitability a ton.  What do you think the margin is for a miner?

The US doesn't really need it.  It's a minor improvement for most people, but it really doesn't have enough to really get people to use unless they have to or there is some use case where they need to use it.  Which is why it's almost exclusively a speculative tool in the US.

Bitcoin will succeed when it solves a multitude problems uniquely that cannot be solved (effectively) using other currencies.  It will never gain any traction based on competing against a bigger network (fiat) with no significant advantages.

Having a room has costs.  Mining a block, you have those costs regardless of block size.
The incremental cost of including a tx is next to nothing.  Therefore, it makes sense to include any block that meets that criteria, because someone else will.  Cartel behavior is not possible in something as decentralized as Bitcoin.  Miners who belong to such a pool will receive greater profits mining with a different pool, which is why no one has such a rule.

This is not true at all.  If 51% ever sustain the old chain long enough, it becomes the ACTUAL chain on the new chain.  It orphans everything that happened after the fork.
If a 51% attack came the other direction, miners would be giving up potential profits and incurring real costs when they could have just mined profitably to gain.  They have to REALLY want to screw the old chain in this case, which is not obvious.

Hotels are nowhere near the commodities that something like a miner is, and nowhere near as decentralized.
Yes, I'm aware how hotels work.  I'm debating whether or not it's relevant to miners.


No, it does.  Miners are not hotels.  A miner sets a policy on his own with some non-trivial hashing power of no less than .001 BTC fee per tx.  He makes a slight disruption to people trying to send for less, for when he mines a block, he refuses to include them.  His competition now benefits, since they grab those transactions and include them.


According to your theory, they should hold out for $5/transaction since it's a hotel room analogy.  People get annoyed and pay more since transactions sometimes take longer.
Any miner that mines for a pool that sets a higher than marginal cost for transactions loses money.  Losing money can be a strategy to harm competition, but in a market like mining that is decentralized, there is no way to coordinate such a strategy.

Likewise, Bitcoin will thrive in areas where there *aren't* activities going on now, due to lack of trust, lack of access, or just some other factor where it couldn't be done.

Yes, my ban seems to be suspiciously timed to when I started making more vocal criticisms of BU.
@_date: 2017-02-10 22:19:04
There's nothing extreme about it.


That's because BU's entire model is based on 51% attacks.


There always will be a 40th percentile of where the EB is defined.  This is inevitable that 40% of miners will consider a certain size excessive, and 60% won't. 


They don't need to be radically different.  For example, Bitcoin.com pool was using a value of 1.0026 MB as valid blocks, barely more than 1.0MB, and they had a fork.


Actually incentives will favor miners who choose to make 33% of the network mine blocks that will be orphaned after wasting 4 blocks or more.  You can get your competitors mining blocks that are doomed at zero cost.  What miner would reject this easy method to increase profits?


There will be an endless supply of low fee transactions ready to enter the network, there's no such thing as 2-3x peak sizes.


I agree, this is why miners will never actually mine on BU without actually having a near monopoly on mining and not caring what others do.


Not at all.  Miners will always mine the valid chain with the most work.  Under BU, all chains are valid irregardless of size, therefore the only way it works like today is if all miners decide to have an EB of infinity.
@_date: 2015-05-31 13:56:05

Why would a cold wallet have to figure out how to transfer them in?  This only needs to occur when a cold wallet holder needs to spend, which he would have to do anyway.  This is far less disruptive than if everyone decided to abandon Bitcoin for an Alt-coin and every minute a cold-wallet holder waits, he loses value.  Here, he has no rush to get out.
Don't refer to the Bitcoin Protocol as Bitcoin Core.  They are different things.  Though it does show you are completely ignorant and your opinions are nothing more than FUD.  It's funny your arguments are actually in favor of side chains rather than against them.
Yes, alt-coins can be attacked, especially merged-mined coins.  This is nothing new and one of the drawbacks of sidechains, although the same factor exists for alt-coins.  You can pretend alt-coins don't exist or you can just accept they will exist, and this is a way to make it easier for people to live in that world (if it works).

Say it's 10 seconds vs. 20 seconds for you to get to sufficient miners to reduce risk.  It's a bit harder in reality since propogation hits different nodes at different times.  But let's idealize this by saying you can send a block that gets everywhere in 10 seconds that is smaller, or a bigger one in 20 seconds.  It's a small period of time compared to the 10 minutes on average it takes to find a block.  If you find a block, chances that anyone else finds a block in the next 20 seconds is ~1/30.  Or the next 10 seconds in ~1/60.  They face the same propagation challenges as you, so assume they always choose small, you always choose big.  This means they get an extra 10 seconds to find a block over you.  If you do not beat them by 10 seconds, you get orphaned.  Your reward is 25 Bitcoins.  If you choose to mine big blocks in this case, your risking 1/60 * 25 Bitcoins - (extra tx fees).  So you better be putting in at least .42BTC in tx fees for that extra 10 seconds!  Your intuition is wrong on this one.  There are significant risks.  As the reward shrinks and tx fees account for a greater percentage of miners income, this incentive changes.

1.  It does not require, but gives an alternative.  And even so, increasing the size does not do anything other than kick the can further down the road, as it's not any kind of permanent solution and perpetually kicking this can down the road will eventually create a Bitcoin that only centralized entities can use.

That's the problem with these solutions - they are sticking Bitcoin into situations they are not good at solving.  The problems it solves well are:
1)  Lack of trust between receiver and sender.  This allows settlement to be guaranteed and irreversible.  Great when dealing with high-fraud potential transactions. 
2) Censorship resistance.  This makes it difficult for governments to block payment for services.  Great for black/grey markets.
3) Inflation resistance.  Somewhat poor right now, but it evens out and even this can be accounted for.  Great for storage of value.
4)  Decentralized ownership.  Tracking ownership of goods without relying on a central party.  Great for ownership records and transferring.
Remittance from a P2P perspective is expensive for a few reasons - labor of operating B&amp;M businesses that conduct the exchanges, taxes/regulatory costs - going to be expensive to comply with many different local laws many with high costs of doing business or fees.  Bitcoin won't really be helpful for the current model of remittance where you have affiliated networks conducting business since the trust level is generally high.  The legal side will be similar.  Where it might help is a more decentralized network of payments, where anyone can set up shop as a transmitter and someone else could be a receiver, and neither party really has to trust each other.  This could allow for greater access, less central choke points and possibly lower labor costs.  But compliance could be even more expensive.
I'm skeptical how much of these costs could be recovered.  No one is going to invest into a costly industry without potential for profit.

We're past the point of people being like "oh, Bitcoin, that's that drug money, right?".  People already know it can buy real stuff.  People already know there are places that accept it.  No one in their right mind is going to buy Bitcoin just to spend it at Dell.  Unless they care about anonymity a LOT, or they simply do not have access to a banking system (but somehow can get Bitcoins easier than a Visa Gift Card -- pretty much no one in the first world, although this could definitely be bigger in places like China), or they have no other way of buying it (dice sites).  The positive parts it has is from people who will now *accept* Bitcoins to settle a debt, and were unlikely to do so for lack of being able to cash out in the past.  The ability to cash out is fairly easy, but the speculative aspect of it is far greater anyway, where people want to accept Bitcoins because it's a lottery ticket.
@_date: 2015-05-04 00:36:01

I explained exactly how it works.  All it takes is getting a transaction in one chain accepted and not the other.  Since one has bigger blocks than what would be allowed in the other, this is obvious that it will happen sooner or later, or Gavincoin isn't even needed.


You need a jump to conclusions mat for this one.  You have no clue what will happen when the block size is hit consistently.  The fees will raise at some point, and people find ways to avoid paying a fee for trivial stuff.  But if there is no pushing for it, those solutions have no incentive to be built.
Yes, fixing a bug does not count as a controversial hard fork.  Everyone was on board and there was zero debate.

@_date: 2014-09-10 14:19:57
In many cases, no.  Because a lot of the problems don't come out for a long time.  Then you have the cost of converting old systems over, which is enormous.  So polishing the turd is preferable many times than starting from scratch.  It's like the ultimate game of Jenga - keep pulling out blocks and putting them on top.  You can probably go another level or two higher and it will stand, but you know it's coming down violently when it does come down.
They'll die off eventually, but there's a ton of legacy code.  Anyone starting from scratch is not going to be using these languages, though.

The key is, if Bitcoin is successful, people won't know they are using it at first.  Then they won't have any choice to use it if it takes off.  I see a success category underneath where the "IT WILL TAKE OVER THE WORLD" fanatics have - even if it is the de facto currency for black market transactions, it will be a huge success.

@_date: 2017-02-23 16:18:41
Yes there is a block weight, which allows for up to 4MB, depending how the transactions are included.


Sure, it's possible.  But that doesn't make it safe to include more.


It's backwards compatible with older versions.  You cannot make an invalid block for old nodes that is valid for upgraded ones.


So if even 10MB blocks are not enough to satisfy scaling, we should think smarter, such as layer 2 solutions like LN.

It's only not wasteful while there isn't a better way.  Now, there hasn't been.  And certainly the level of security might be overkill for this size of the network based on the huge subsidy compared to value, but that gets fixed with time and might actually be beneficial to grow the network security faster than the network needs for a while to make it harder to attack.

You are assuming that an individual benefits from switching pools and it's just laziness.  Miners will mine whichever is most profitable, and do not have the impact to make any cost of having a large pool benefit them.
Think of it this way - you have a large community orchard where anyone can go and pick the fruit whenever they want.  The best case scenario for the community is to wait until the fruit is ripe, then split up the fruit equally.  However, individual actors could decide to take fruit a day before peak ripeness to get some fruit, then get their share of what's left.  Eventually, what happens, is everyone is picking the fruit as soon as it is barely edible, or else they get nothing at all.
Mining is like this.  There are incentives to join these pools (pick now).  There are benefits to the community if they do not join the pool (pick later).  The miner wants everyone else to not join the pool so Bitcoin does best, but individually he can "cheat" and join the most profitable pool, even if it is harmful for Bitcoin.
You are requiring the miner to be "good" or "altruistic" to have things succeed.  Unsustainable.

You are confusing volatility with expected value.  Dice sites have tremendous volatility and a thin margin.  If you think cutting their EV by .3% has no effect on profitability because it falls within the noise, you are highly mistaken.
Mining by its nature is not going to have huge margins.  Even small cuts in expected revenue can have tremendous effects on the profitability.  The onus is on Gavin, who dismisses it as "no big deal" to prove that they have sufficient margins already that .3% is nothing anyone will care about or not.  And margins would have to be extremely high for someone to not care about making more somewhere else.

You can also have a minimal trust system with OT, multisig, and continuous audits along with digital cash off-chain, that eventually settles on the blockchain, but again, that doesn't fit into your preconceived notions of how the problem should be solved.
There are numerous ways to solve this problem without the expense of bloating a blockchain to the point of being unusable or expensive.

In every one of those cases, you could easily argue that the business controls the keys.  If you have any kind of multisig where they hold one key, you could have that case.

Gavin's 40% increases is even dumber than just a kick the can down the road.
I'd be open to the change if there was a need for it, or any actual benefit given the tradeoffs.  There is not a crisis now.  Hard forks that add useful functionality without tradeoffs are something I'm incredibly open to.  Hard forks in response to crises also make a strong case, along with hard forking whenever there is an obvious bug.  I am opposed to hard forks that fundamentally challenge the two biggest value propositions of Bitcoin - Decentralization and Censorship Resistance.

But no one holds onto checks, they cash them, usually almost instantly.  Compare this to dollar bills, which exist for a while, and may or may not get deposited into an account.
The way this *could* work, is if you had a transfer to another account at the same institution.  Suppose Coinbase went FRB and didn't have the Bitcoins they claimed to.  Now while you couldn't write a check or anything, you could transfer from your Coinbase account to someone elses.  And they might very well accept that payment at no discount, since everyone assumes they can always get the coins out (and Coinbase claims to have all coins secured).  Now let's say Coinbase hired Mark Karpeles as head of security, and he "loses" some coins, but is too embarrassed to tell anyone about it.  So Coinbase keeps operating without the coins, everyone's balance is higher than what Coinbase has in its "vaults", but you have essentially FRB.  Anyone who transfers internal within Coinbase thinks everything is fine.  But if enough people cash out, they are screwed.  Now replace "loses" with "loans" to some bad business who cannot pay back debts, and you have the same situation.  People do get wise, especially when you can actually OWN YOUR OWN KEY, and decide to stay away.

Yep, Gavincoin, even years down the road, could become irrelevant.  Though, the fix is easy, such as what is described here:
What is the incentive for a miner to cooperate?  Miners can believe one chain is the best, follow the rules, etc..., but they will, in the end, follow the money.  Miners will not honor votes simply to honor them when there's money to be made going against them.  A miner that chooses the 1MB side may reluctantly upgrade.  A miner that chooses the 20MB side, may choose to take advantage of lower difficulty on the 1MB side if the price is right.  Voting by miners is not terribly helpful.  The miner that takes the first step in making that currently invalid block will be the one who actually puts anything substantial on the line, and very easily could have his block orphaned now, or orphaned down the road.
@_date: 2014-11-20 17:26:49

This is not hard.
@_date: 2015-05-05 02:51:57
This is not really true, only settlement must occur on the chain.
Transactions can occur anywhere.  The key is to keep transactions such that failures that exist do not harm honest participants and that there is as little trust as possible.  This can be done with many systems other than the expensive proof of work based distributed consensus.

Bitcoin Unlimited's broken model certainly is a serious matter.


There is no world where a deterministic, known value is safer than an unknown, dynamic, and possibly incorrect number (there's  no reason miners will even be honest in what their true EB values are).


Not sure why names are relevant, when ideas are easily described.  You don't have to be a game  theory expert to find holes in this proposal.  Your assertions that they wouldn't engage doesn't make it true.  There is an academic paper that already covers this subject describing selfish mining that cane easily be extended here.


Which is why I believe that the effective result of BU will be an unlimited block size with miners unable to reign in any miners who violate their EB values.


This may be why miners, users, and businesses are rejecting BU.


You mean when there was a fixed relay limit (which has been removed?)  Situations where 1MB is the max block size - which, by removing, changes the dynamics completely (e.g. a miner can't gain much of an advantage from 1MB, but very easily could by mining a 1GB block).


There's always been a block limit of 1MB.  The limit has not been "worked up".  Miners voluntarily mined smaller blocks, and that's it.


The miners mining BU have no intention of actually mining with the BU rules.  They are simply pawns in a political game involving Jihan Wu and Core.  This is why the only pool that actually forked off the network was Roger Ver's pool.  However, if mining is sufficiently centralized  (and they believe economic nodes will follow them), they would do it.  That's the other rub- the economic nodes will reject the BU blocks even if there was a vast majority of miners wishing to run it.


I agree with you on this, EB will be infinite and we will now have a system where the majority of miners can knock off the minority (unable to validate), and we run into a system where only a few datacenters can even validate transactions.  This is a dream scenario for those looking to co-opt the Bitcoin network.

You are selling gold for Bitcoin.  You set an AD to 4.  You see a block where someone pays you $100,000 in Bitcoin.  You get a confirmation.  You wait 4 blocks.  Still confirmed, all looks good!  You wait 6 more blocks, still looks good!  So you give up your gold, the guy walks out the door.
5 minutes later, your node shows that you have no funds from that transaction.  You trace the input, and see that he instead paid someone else the $100,000.
Wait, this can't be!  I set AD to 4!  I waited for 10 confirms!
But here's what happened:
At block X, two blocks were mined, one that was under your EB setting, and one above.  You take the one that's below it, clearly, and reject the other.  It contains your payment.  You have no idea that X' exists.
Meanwhile, 60% of the miners are mining on X', and 40% on X.  You see blocks X, X+1, X+2, ...., X+10.  All look good.  Meanwhile, the X' chain is slowly outgrowing the X chain.  When you have X+5, they have X'+8.  Still not enough to trigger your client into accepting it.  Finally, when you see X+10, X'+14 is published, and your client wipes out all of the X chain blocks, and starts following the X+10 block.
You now have -$100,000 in gold and $0 in Bitcoins from the transaction.
Sorry for your losses.

You are talking about a hard fork.


So your theory is miners will just stop mining what people want mined?  Interesting theory.


You may not, but it still has value.  And something can have value even without a fixed supply, esp if the inflation rate is known and predictable.  Bitcoin will have inflation until the day I die, but it still has value.


Only because users would reject those blocks, not because miners have it in their interests.

RBF is a policy of miners.  They don't have to honor Opt-in if they don't want (and rational ones won't).
QR codes are dependent on wallet implementation and typically don't define fee.


0-conf are not safe, period.  However, if you know the identity of who is buying from you and have recourse, or you can revoke the service, then it might be worth the risk. Also if it's low value.

Sure.  I had to deal with a similar situation.  You create your deposit transaction and get the hash of it.  Create a transaction that refunds your deposit back to yourself, but locked for a week in the future (or some other time frame).  Have B sign it.  B does the same for you.  You both deposit.  Once the deposit has been made, you create a transaction that sends both deposits to the same address, both parties sign, and now the refunds are invalid and the funds are locked.  If either party doesn't deposit, you wait a week and redeem your refund.

Common sense.  GBMiners is supportive of SegWit, then a day after Jihan visits, they are running BU and have increased hashpower.  ViaBTC comes out of nowhere, and magically has a huge amount of Bitmain chips pointed at them.  A few more pools appear out of nowhere, and hashpower disappears from Antpool to point at those pools.

You seem to not understand basic economics.  Miners will want to include the higher fee (per byte) transactions.  Sure, congestion will not disappear, but those who pay the fee will jump the queue.  Those who gain the most value from using Bitcoin will get to use it, and those who are using it for trivial purposes or trolling can sit in the mempool hoping someone lets them ride for free.
You use the term race condition.  That word, I do not think it means what you think it means.
Fees decrease demand, not increase supply.  That is a sufficient way to control congestion.  It's been used on tollways for years with great success.  It also pushes people towards alternatives when the costs don't make sense.

The most preferred upgrade path is users and miners work together and deploy upon nearly all miners are upgraded.  This minimizes any chain splits.
In the event that miners are uncooperative or the threat, you upgrade without them.  This can lead to a potential chain split, depending on the contents and what miners decide to do, but in the end, users have the power.

Miners can veto the hard forks that are backward compatible.

@_date: 2015-05-04 16:23:35
I never intentionally tried to make that argument.
Let me rephrase.  Gavincoin will have some &gt;1MB blocks that are invalid on Bitcoin.  Those will contain transactions that will take much longer to confirm on Bitcoin.  Some transactions from Gavincoin will make it into a later block in Bitcoin, while others will sit in the mempool until they expire, especially as more blocks exceed the 1MB limit in Bitcoin.  Once that happens it's trivially easy to spend on Gavincoin and keep your coins in Bitcoin.  By spending to yourself, you can separate the coins you own into different addresses and control.

But the vast majority of that is being bought by consumers/end users.  And as long as it is unprofitable for miners to purchase it just for mining, then there is no incentive to collect it just for mining.


Every time you create an incentive this also forms the basis of leveraging that incentive, as a meta-incentive, to obtain more of it. And this leads to centralization of power and geometric distribution curves. This is not the dam, this is the very physics which enables one to build dams.

The better question is why didn't the price go down?  Merchant adoption just puts downward pressure.  Except in the case where people are unable to buy things, except using Bitcoins, and can acquire Bitcoins.  A guy in China who would have to pay like crazy with Chinese Yuan for a Dell but can pay with Bitcoin might drive the price up ever so slightly, but all the early adopters cashing out for their new gaming rigs will only bring it down.

Supply and demand.  Increasing price decreases demand for transactions.  The marginal transactions ("hey, look, here's a nickel I'll send you as a tip!") disappear, and serious use cases persist.  They move to dogecoin or changetip or other resources.  Bitcoin remains the leader and valuable and spam gets moved to other alternatives.

It is not EXTRA profit, it is extra revenue.  That is a big difference.  Because you are neglecting costs.  .3% increase in revenue in tight-margin businesses is gigantic.
And you are right, if you are in a small pool, you stand to lose .33% by being in a small pool, because you are mining below average, and the bigger pools are mining above average.
As transactions make a greater part of revenue of miners, there is no shooting yourself in the foot with slow-to-propagate miners, there is a real competitive disadvantage with missing out on fees.
I have no idea why you bring up variance in this conversation.

Why would this happen?  Because the block sizes are 20MB Gavincoin and 1MB in the Bitcoin.  So I can send coins in the Gavincoin chain with no or super low fees, they get mined.

The old chain simply cannot keep up with the new one, because size limits, therefore, it's trivial.

Doing this would be suicide.  There's even an academic paper that shows that Bitcoin breaks when there is not a backlog or coinbase reward.


You seem to think arguments only have weight when an authority gives their opinion. That's a fallacy.


BU relies on hopes and dreams and ignores all adversarial thinking.


That's incorrect. At one point, Satoshi's dice made up 94% of the traffic.  Without limits, it would have remained high, because there is near endless demand for near free transactions.  Instead, it was priced out and gambing sites today use more efficient means without polluting all nodes for the entire history forward of Bitcoin.


What makes you think that what people put into the mempool wouldn't change?  If there was a 1GB block size, I could create several 100MB transactions and pay a Satoshi to back up files.  KimDotCom might start stuffing files to share on EVERY computer that stores the blockchain.  This cannot happen now because of the limit, therefore no one tries.


Every new pool that pops up out of nowhere has the fingerprints of him on it. For example, when Ponzi Scammers GBMiners switched over, Jihan Wu was there a day before.


Miners are always free to mine alt-coins.  But a hard fork is up to users.  And miners mining blocks no one accept won't be worth very much.


Not like a hard fork, as a hard fork gives users the option to continue. In the above scenario, a miner cannot even keep up with validating transactions and is purged from the network completely.


You are incorrect in thinking I even think this.  Choose your own chain!  Choose Dogecoin or Litecoin or CLAMS or UnlimitedCoin.  That's your freedom.  Feel free to exit at any time.

Actually this is improved.  With the two-way-peg, it doesn't matter where my coins are.  I can switch between chains at will.  I can't do that with any alt-coins, I need to try to guess which alt-coin would have an advantage, and if I guess wrongly, I lose.  Though I have the potential to gain in that scenario.


Only affects those who go to that chain, no worse than 51% attack on alt-coins.  The only legitimate concern I see is that this system will not work (for reasons Peter Todd outlined).  And if it doesn't work, it only really affects those who put their coins at risk.

It depends what you are defining as a successful attack.  1-3 block Finney attack double-spends, yes.  But these attacks are temporary and just change the security model for accepting transactions.  Users would just require a larger number of confirmations where it is not economical to attack.  The chain still lives on providing utility.


This is based on a lot of assumptions.  In reality, price/difficulty ratio will define what this shrinks to.  If the old chain is more valuable than expected, miners will come back.  If less so, then more miners will defect, seeking profits.


You are assuming that miners *should* make the switch.  Miners serving a community still committed to staying put will be in demand and will be able to earn.  This is different than a soft fork, where miners who don't upgrade will have no market to serve as their blocks get orphaned.

The transaction was certainly valid.  But Bitcoin is not deterministic in what will be accepted by miners.
Sending another transaction with the hope it gets processed so you do not lose money is intent to defraud, although it's pretty clear the intent was not to defraud, especially with the offers to immediately pay the money back.  There needs to be harm for any kind of crime to be committed.  For example, if someone tells me that I can press a magic combination on a gas pump and it will let me pump for free, I try it and get a small amount of gas and immediately go inside to pay for it, there is no harm.

Since miners need to sell coins to operate, chances are they will follow the economy.  If the economy is not there, then it doesn't matter.


Which doesn't happen in any known client.

No, they enforce the old rules.  And the signature is valid (anyone can spend).
What you cannot predict is whether or not future miners will orphan the block or not.  Miners can decide to orphan blocks for any reason they choose, including whether or not the blocks have extra data that is expected, or simply because they don't like the block.
Suppose miners made a secret rule that all block ids must have at least 1 "b" in them in hex.  A majority of miners decide to enforce this rule, and orphan any block without a 'b' in it.  This does not mean that users are not validating blocks - they are.  It just happens that some blocks they see as valid may get orphaned.  Same thing if the miners never had this rule, and a chain was orphaned just due to bad luck.  Users can never predict that a block that is valid will always be included in the longest chain.

BU does not "activate".  It's just a free for all of orphaning each other when miners decide to fork.
Miners currently are not set to accept or mine blocks &gt; 1MB, which is identical to Core as well, so they won't fork off no matter what happens.


On the other hand, SegWit has a well defined signalling process, where miners can know what others are doing.  And signalling it without running code isn't even that wreckless.  You won't mine an invalid block unless you purposefully try.  But I recokon no miners signalling are not running the software.

Backed implies directly redeemable for something.
Gives value is the reason why something is valuable.  A currency backed by gold is valuable because it can be redeemed for gold and gold is valuable.  USD are not backed by anything at all (though it used to be backed by gold!).
Bitcoin is backed by nothing (you can't redeem it for computing power, as some mistakenly have said in the past).  But same with USD.  But USD has value because people accept it, taxes are required to be paid in it.  Bitcoin has value because it is accepted, can be transported around the world nearly instantly, is very divisible, is fungible, is durable, and is impossible to counterfeit.

A change increasing blocksize without upgrading clients would almost surely fork the blockchain if any miners stay behind.  Clients would also reject blocks that are valid, thus miss transactions.
It's not that big of a deal, though, and can be mitigating with obtaining consensus before making a change.
Then again, I would not be surprised if there was sufficient pushback against increasing the block size and an intentional fork if there was any substantial support.  A lot of people are blowing up a non-issue "omg block size too small" into FUD, which will then be used to be the end of the non-data-center nodes.  Yay centralization!
@_date: 2017-02-20 22:25:03
If it gets costly, that's a huge incentive for miners to cheat and include transactions rather than mine empty blocks, and even for miners to return to this chain.  After a few weeks max, things return to normal.
Meanwhile the other chain also suffers similar delays since it's only operating at 75% power and there is a lot of increased demand due to people wanting to split coins to sell one side or the other.
In any case, you'll see a drastic spike in traffic on each chain with huge backlogs.

Fees are not paid proportionally to amount, but resources used.

There's nothing in Bitcoin's protocol level to stop users from intentionally or unintentionally overpay for transactions.  Just because one bozo accidentally sends a 10BTC fee to a miner doesn't mean the network forced him to.

Merchants are never forced to accept RBF.  They can politely decline an RBF payment, and offer a refund after a non-RBF is sent.

There was a hard fork that was required when there was an accidental fork when the soft limit was changed above 500kb.  Once the limit was expanded, it caused the network to fork.  Fixing this required a hard fork.

Explain the attack vector for the soft fork, and how it does not apply to a node with a hard fork.  And of course, if you want your node to follow hard fork behavior, you can easily have it do that in the event of a soft fork.

I'm not talking about securing Project Gutenberg.
The first appearance of the claim might be considered legitimate in this case.  It doesn't help on initial claims, but it does going forward.
It appears that this would work by registering land, which is a process which stores it in a hash.  Yes, the initial process is possible for fraud, but once it gets past that, it's a helluva lot better.  The fraud that exists at registration time exists regardless of the system.
I do believe the entire document set does need to be public for this to work, otherwise you could have 15 titles on the same land and no one would know the difference.  But you'd only be interested in land titles in Guatemala, rather than some other record keeping entity around.

No, the block limit is removed from the code.  It is replaced by block weigh, which more closely follows the resources needed to process the block.  This allows up to 4MB blocks.  Old nodes would only see 1MB of this block, maximum.


Every solution will require a hard limit.  So in this case, you can say nothing is scaling.

People are generally as honest as they have to be.  When there are incentives to be honest, people will be honest.  When there aren't, honesty is much less likely.
Imagine you have a bank vault that has a large group outside of it with lots of cameras pointing toward the inside, monitoring everything that happens.  Everyone in this group knows who owns what inside of it.  One by one, someone enters the vault and is allowed to remove their money.  People watch on the camera to ensure no one takes more than their share.  To no one's surprise, no one steals any money, as there would be an angry mob waiting for them if they did.
Now turn off the cameras.  To no one's surprise, the second guy enters the vault, and there is no money left.
We can trust miners to be honest because we are all actively ensuring they are.

I wanted to touch on this in more detail.
I think everyone wants to increase capacity as quickly as safely possible without compromising the system.  Fortunately, we don't need a massive increase immediately.  Fees are still quite low, backlogs are regularly pushed through.  There is a list of all of the wallets who plan to add support for SegWit that is quite extensive.  I think your estimate of years is off from what people are committed to, and Core developers are actively helping wallets upgrade to support SegWit.  So I certainly understand the concern that SegWit will be too little too late, it will be ready and used by many very quickly.
A hard fork, when safely deployed, will take more time than a soft fork.  With a hard fork, you need to make sure *everyone* has upgraded well in advance.  We don't have software for a hard for now, and likely won't have it for a few months (Classic developers were telling me hoping to have it in March).  From that point, you need to upgrade everyone.  This would take a few more months if we were rushing it as fast as reasonably possible.  So you are looking at no increases until maybe close to the end of the year.  A soft fork, on the other hand, could safely be deployed as soon as a month after software is ready.  The SW soft fork is already developed and in test now.  If your goal is speed of deployment, the SW soft fork is the best option.  I understand there may be other concerns, so if so, please raise them.

@_date: 2016-03-04 20:08:14
I'm speaking honestly.  Miners that have additional requirements do not make any validation done by nodes lessened.
SW transaction are explicitly constructed so that no signature is needed.  People who choose to receive transactions as SegWit transactions pass on the risk to miners, and may choose to follow a minority fork if miners are not on board.
As for a user validating a block - what happens?  A node sees a block that contains a transaction that is anyone can spend.  The block is valid.  However, a bunch of other miners reject that block and instead put down different blocks.  So the node is in no worse shape than when miners orphan blocks, which happens *every day*.  It is no less secure than the security risk of orphaned blocks.  Are you arguing that any block that is orphaned is somehow as dangerous as not validating the block?
A node that wants to use Seg Witness transactions will upgrade his node.  So he is at no risk that someone can steal his coins being anyone can spend, since he will follow a minority chain that only lets him spend the transactions.  No security risk, and he is validating the transactions he cares about.
So, no, there is no security risk, and only those who care about extra signatures need to validate them.

There are several negative possibilities.  Running a full node becomes much harder.  This has many implications other than just hobbyists, but also centralizes mining with longer propagation times.  It destroys incentives for improvements to Bitcoin that would actually make it scale more than kicking the can down the road would do.  And it sets a very dangerous precedent for what kind of changes in the future could be tried to be put into a hard fork.

And miners can choose any arbitrary rule they want for rejecting blocks.  Miners can choose to reject blocks that don't come with a secret handshake on a private channel.

Let's assume you are right that miners both vote with honest intent, and will follow through for a while (even if it makes sense not to).  You end up with two viable forks.  25% is quite a lot of hashpower and causes a little short term pain as difficulty resets, but it's pretty easy to ride this out.  We end up with two forks for quite a while.  Mining hashpower follows the price/difficulty ratio once things stabilize.
There are incentives to be on the longest chain.  There are incentives to be on a chain that cannot be orphaned as well.  There are incentives to be on chains that best offer properties that give Bitcoin it's unique value proposition.  It's complex.
You have a lot of wishful thinking about faking being silly.  If you are a miner, and you can knock out your competition that represents 40-45% of the market share for a significant loss, it's a no-brainer.  We've seen mining pools be victims of sophisticated withholding attacks which actually have a cost associated with them.  Miners have one main incentive - profit.  Being on the majority doesn't give them more profits by default.  Price determines this.  If it is profitable to mine the minority chain, they will.  This is seen all the time as miners hop between alt-coins all the time.
If the goal is to fragment the ecosystem and cause damage, 75-80% is a perfect number.  If the goal is to have a consensus-based fork where everyone is on board, you want a much higher number.  We cannot rely on wishful thinking.
@_date: 2015-05-31 13:36:45
There's no reason to think that the voting will reflect miners actual actions.  There is a real incentive to vote differently than what you intend to do.  If you favor large blocks, you want to have the smallest amount possible to do it, with the others trying to mine the lower value fork.  If you favor smaller blocks, you can vote for the bigger blocks and hope people go on that fork, then you get to mine the smaller blocks alone.
Without any penalty for voting differently than your actions, the vote is completely useless other than knowing who is paying attention.

No one is doing this to increase fees.  Miners can already do this, and already have decided not to do this.  Miners are the only direct beneficiaries of larger fees, so I see no reason to force the issue for them.

Yes it is difficult.  And that's the point, it should be much greater.  We should be moving together and only do things that benefit all at the expense of none.  The only objections should be trivial and from troublemakers.
50% is not consensus, and the concept of "50% consensus" does not exist, Consensus is not a percentage.  50% consensus is No Consensus.  75% consensus is No Consensus.
When the system can be easily changed (by whims of masses, by a developer who has gone rogue or been manipulated or threatened), it's very fragile.  A small amount of stress to those systems will result in their positive properties being destroyed.  I would consider a system of multiple checks and balances much more anti-fragile than one that any single component could cause the whole thing to change or break.
Most of this "anti-fragile" meme is just gobbledegook coming out of Antonopolous videos where it gets the derps excited without actually thinking about it.  The actual concept of anti-fragility is gaining through chaos applies more to Bitcoin as a currency becoming more valuable as the world becomes more chaotic.  This is almost exclusively because it avoids the whims of politicians, masses, or rogue dictators destroying it.

No one is tricking anything.  The transaction *is* valid.  It's just it might never make it as part of the longest chain (just like a transaction that has too low of a fee, or that miners decide to block from being accepted for *any* reason they choose).

@_date: 2016-01-14 19:21:23
If something drops in value, but I get more of it, I still can be better off.
For example, overfishing.  With a given fish population, the ecosystem is healthy.  There are enough fish to continue at a certain rate for eternity.  Fisherman are heavily invested in that ecosystem with boats and nets and so forth.  They clearly have an incentive to make sure the fish population stays stable.
But overfishing occurs and each fisherman is locally incentivized to overfish.  His individual overfishing does not drastically contribute to any problems, and if he chooses not to overfish, others will at his expense.  Thus everyone overfishes and the ecosystem is destroyed.  This is where everyone's local incentives lead to a worse result for all.
Mining is much the same way, where individual miners can stand to gain more locally by acting a certain way, which causes long term issues.  And if they decide *not* to act that way, the problem still occurs by those who *are* willing to exploit at the "good" miners expense.  The good miner goes out of business and the exploitative miners dominate.
Self policing can exist only when the miners themselves are able to set rules and policies to punish "cheaters".  In this case, miners may very well decide to punish those who make big blocks by intentionally orphaning them with a soft-fork-like limit.  The trouble is the big miners stand the most to gain and have the most power in enforcing such a limit.  Beyond that, it's trivially easy for miners to pretend to be separate pools or under separate control simply for image.

Segwit is a soft fork that requires 95% of miners to signal it.

First it needs to be activated by miners.  Once that happens, many wallets are already ready, and more will soon be ready after that (and likely before activation), so you'll see a considerable increase.

Not really.  Look at how the system is designed and look at alternatives if you were optimizing for cost.  You wouldn't design such a system with an expensive proof of work mining system.  That cost is there, whether it's taken from subsidies (which makes holding less valuable) or transactions (which makes transactions less valuable).  It's a very expensive system.


No one is trying to play economics.  No one is advocating trying to create a fee market just to create one (miners can do this any time they want, and they are the beneficiaries of such a system).  What people are saying is a fee market is not something to be terrified of.


Oh wait, I thought the point was to have cheap payments?  Maybe you are seeing it's not, and what it is designed for.


No, this is my point exactly.  It is designed for that purpose, AT GREAT EXPENSE.  Bitcoin is *NOT* about cheap fees (although maybe they'll be kind of cheap if subsidized by holders), it's about an open system that can operate globally without interference from others.  The reality is, such a system is more costly than updating a single database ledger.  Such costs don't get paid for by magical unicorns dropping money to people.  They get paid by users.  And for Bitcoin to be useful in those areas, it needs to be able to be funded by users who find those properties valuable.  Users that do not find them valuable and look for the cheapest option will continue to use systems in place today that are built for solving that problem (or new systems that are designed for solving that problem).  Bitcoin solves an entirely different problem and solves it well, so let's focus on making that part work well, rather than throwing it all away just so a few people can throw pennies at each other for free.

But you may think "wait, this is not good!  I better set AD to 0!"
So you do.  You always accept the most work.
But we'll go with a 40/60 split for miners again.  But this time, the 40% side gets a little behind, but then gets lucky (which will happen).
You accept block X'.  It has your payment.  Block X has a payment to himself instead.  You then see block X'+1 (meanwhile, miners with EB of 1MB ignore these blocks).  Since the hashpower is close and they get a little lucky, they manage to stay within 1 block of X'.  Then with a bit of luck, they overtake the X' chain.  At this point, the X'  miners all switch to X, along with your node.  You now have -$100,000 in gold, and $0 in Bitcoin.
You may think "well, this is unlikely, a minority outrunning a majority!"  But, turns out, 45% of the hashpower is a FAVORITE to outrun the 55% hashpower before falling 4 blocks behind.  Run the math.  So 40% doesn't take an extreme amount of luck to make this happen, just like sometimes blocks are found within 2 minutes instead of 10.
Sorry for your losses.

1000 blocks does not take 70 days.  It's 7 days. The math has already been shown how likely it is to happen with less support (I forget the exact paper, but it even had pretty drawings for the Peter R disciples to consume.
And yes, miners could intentionally prevent the fork if they wanted to, and they could fake support for it, causing it to trigger in clients with new rules, having them mine blocks that will be orphaned until someone manually intervenes and reverts them back to the real rules.
The fork is intentionally triggered at a dangerous level precisely to force the issue at the expense of consensus even at the mining level.  Mike Hearn chose to play a game of chicken, where he drives head on into traffic, hoping everyone gets out of the way and follows his new rules.  It is reckless and dangerous, even among those who want to change the rules.

Decentralization is a means to an end.
Some good metrics to consider:
- Cost to run a validating node (useful for determining how dependent we are on miners)
- Distribution and cost of controlling transaction selection (useful for determining how hard it would be to censor)
- Distribution of hashpower (useful for determining how people can react if a mining pool behaves badly)


User base isn't really why these things are hard to stamp out - in fact, some things with large user bases are easy to stamp out, and some things with very small user bases are quite hard to stamp out.  Why are drugs hard to stamp out?  Because drugs can be grown in many locations and distributed easily without being detected.  This is why online gambling was pretty easy to stamp out, even though it may have had as many if not more users.  Online gambling relied on centralized payment networks to fund, and the government just needed to threaten the banks on this one, and it shut down a considerable amount.
As for your plan- 


This is a really dumb idea for governments.  While it could cause a temporary disruption, changing the hashing algorithm is something that takes minimal effort to do and makes the whole operation worthless.


A better approach since it doesn't take a huge investment.  This is where having mining decentralized is very helpful.  In an ideal situation, the governments have no clue where the hashpower is even located, and even if it does, it's in so many different jurisdictions or locations that shutting it down is infeasible.  This is like saying goverments can just shut down the producers of drugs.  If there's only a single plant that is capable of making it, it's super easy.  If it's something that anyone can grow in their backyard or basement, it's impossible to stop.


A better approach.  But, Bitcoin would still be super useful for criminals at this point, so all it does is harm more legitimate users.  Useful if a government wants to stop mainstream adoption.  But, Bitcoin still is worth the threat in many cases, and nearly impossible to have governments detect this.  Also it is highly unlikely to happen given the laws of the US and EU (China I could see this happening).


This is the most likely attack, as it's super easy to manipulate the community to turn on itself.  In fact, I think this is exactly what we are seeing today.  It won't shut down Bitcoin, but if you can get the community to devour itself and cripple the strengths of the currency, it is controlled.

Provoking an overreaction from one side can be as powerful as any kind of overwhelming force.  The powerful generally will not want any kind of upheaval or chaos.  Those without power have the least to lose (e.g. some poor peasant will lose a lot less than Trump in a thermonuclear war).  Milo is playing this game - say outrageous things and provoke (e.g. troll) in an attempt to draw an overreaction from the other side, which firms up support on his side.  Trump plays this same game as well.
The key is to get more support on your side so that it's politically unpalatable to oppose you.  Using violence is the quickest way to stop this.  I would not be surprised if false flags happened in these cases quite often.  I think I remember in some BLM protest, there were police officers undercover instigating some of the violence in order to justify police action/turn public opinion against them.  That being said, there is so much irrationality and emotion right now, it's trivially easy to just say a few things to get a massive overreaction and violence from the most extreme.

Yes, you are describing FSS RBF.


How does it use it for no reason?  I'm not sure you quite understand how RBF works and what is on the blocks.  FSS RBF reduces privacy far worse, RBF reduces no privacy (if you think it does, can you outline this)?
opt-in RBF does not increase fraud potential one bit, as it is opt-in.  full-RBF is not something that we can stop a miner from running, so that risk is always there.  Opt-in clearly marks an intent to allow changes, and those accepting transactions know that risk is there.  They can plan accordingly.

Different people want different goals.  Sometimes those goals are close enough to try to work together, but sometimes they are vastly different.  What if a significant portion of the island is content with staying there?  Should they be forced to participate in the escape efforts?  Perhaps the two groups can agree to peacefully exist and work together for food and shelter, but diverge elsewhere.  Maybe their goals are identical or completely compatible for some time, even years.  When they first arrive at the island, everyone agrees to survive first, and there is no reason to even think about leaving the island.  But once time meets those needs, or resources become scarce enough that a choice needs to be made, their common purpose dissolves.
The division in Bitcoin is the result of trade-offs and vastly different opinions on what Bitcoin solves.  One group values cheap transactions highly.  One group values monetary sovereignty highly.  These goals were compatible for the early days of Bitcoin before it became terribly popular.  Both groups got what they needed.  But we are hitting a crossroads, where actual tradeoffs need to be made.  We cannot have it both ways.  So rather than try to work together and end up with a crappy system for both sets of users, why not diverge paths, wish each other well, and let each achieve their own goals?  Those wishing to leave the island shouldn't drag those who wish to stay simply because they are good fisherman or would be useful on the journey.
Mike Hearn's choice to leave Bitcoin represented that choice to move to a path more consistent with his vision.  Good for him.  I applaud his efforts far more than the efforts of Gavin, the Toomims, Olivier, and the others, who, instead of  finding a better solution for their goals, try to drag a peacefully existing people out to sea on a mission that may very well end in failure, when they are happy to exist as is.

There are specific attack vectors that can be used.  Pieter Wuille outlined them pretty well here:
For the most part, there aren't any interesting attacks that make a full node at risk.
BTW, I think you have a misunderstanding of how the soft fork transactions work.  They *do* make sense to the unupgraded nodes, they just have a looser meaning of what makes them valid.  So to an upgraded node, it appears that the transaction is valid with a large subset of signatures, but turns out it is actually much more narrow.  This only gets the node in trouble if it accepts a 0-conf version spend of this transaction, but the same problem would exist today if I created an anyone can spend transaction in the same way.
The biggest problem is an upgraded node may follow a chain that will be orphaned for a small period of time.  This is why waiting for miners to upgrade to a large consensus level is essential.

Sure, it might be lower. But it's not necessarily less secure - miners could come back to mine for profit for gains just as easily.  But if it's proportionally priced compared to difficulty, miners can go to it and profit.
For example, say Fork A has a difficulty of .25X and a price of .30Y, while Fork B has a difficulty of .75X and .70Y.  Miners would be dumb to mine on B, so they would switch to A for a while, drive the difficulty up, then move back.  Miners can be very fickle here.  They aren't going to mine at a loss attacking the short chain when their competitors are going to mine the long chain for profit.
The price will dictate where miners go, not the other way around.  If miners start acting maliciously, then it destroys confidence in all coins.

In the end, if two groups have diverse enough needs, if the benefits of working together and cooperating are less than the benefits of a breakup, then divorces will happen.  Ideally, we'll have some kind of two-way peg mechanism that allows an independent currency to exist and allow users to use features they need that would disturb others.  However, with as much power as soft-forks have, we may be able to give everyone their cake to have and eat it too.  Users can opt-in to features they need and not harm others who do not need it.

If the price is stable, they'll have to turn off rigs, and if the price drops, they have to turn off rigs, but if the price goes up, they can survive.  So you make a desperate bid for a fork, hoping maybe that winning will make the price goes up.

It depends how much support each side has.  The proposed hard forks have very unsafe levels of 75% advertised support (which means &lt;75% due to getting lucky at some point, and false support).  They almost guarantee that the split would happen prematurely.
Surely the rest will switch?  That depends on the change and the support of it.  Mike hand-waves to say it will be swift to switch over, but I think he fundamentally misunderstands why people value certain things, and changing things will lead some to stay with the original rules.  Plus, you can swap coins between each side, and there are committed people who *will* do this.


I'm sure you can use Google.  Developer Email list is probably a good place to go.


Correct.  You can do this if you want.  I wouldn't recommend it, but hey, if you love hard forks so much, you can treat soft forks like hard forks as long as the soft fork is written in such a way (and most try to).


That's the entire point.  When you see a block that is "invalid" due to new rules that you don't know about, it's a short-lived minority chain that no one cares about.  That's how you get defrauded (potentially).  Except with a soft fork, this chain dies very quickly, the attack vector is much more narrow.  Eventually miners who accidentally mine these chains will upgrade or lose money.

I know, a lot of you derps are slow on this one.  With 75% support, you need a lucky streak with 70% or less, which means 30% are not voting for it, meaning they will be able to continue mining their fork with minimal interruption.  It guarantees that both forks are viable.  This increases risk for any miners who decide to mine with the new rules as even a small amount of fake support can doom them, and any miscalculations in price or value of each potential chain could lead other miners to switching back to the other forks, thus orphaning the "new" chain when the original chain outgrows it.

I'm not asking it to be bent to any specific individual.  However, if the only individuals capable of running nodes are central datacenters, we are no better off than previous legacy systems.


This is just handwaving.  There's no reason to believe that the impact of the value is proportional to the externalities miner produce, nor that certain miners self-regulation is directly tied toward value.

It's easy to take things without context.
We should not make technical changes that risk the whole system to prevent a fee market.  Allowing one to develop when necessary, within the safe limits of the system, is preferable to artificially bumping block size beyond safe limits, simply to avoid a fee market.  The context of this mail was one where the development of a fee market is considered a huge risk and hazard, and Pieter is refuting the claim that we cannot let one happen sooner than later.
A fee market developing is not a catastrophe in itself.  However, we should allow blocks to be as large as technically feasible, and if miners do decide to change their demand for a fee market, they will be the ones who restrict block sizes to force it.

This is incorrect.  You don't need everyone to upgrade, which is why this is beneficial.  We won't need to fill 2MB blocks for quite some time, so a gradual improvement in what is practically possible will keep fees low and transactions from getting backed up.
Many wallets are committed to using SW immediately.  The others that aren't have people willing to help bring them up to speed.  Worst case scenario, if a wallet refuses to upgrade, you can move your keys to a wallet that does support it to take advantage of the benefits.

Bitcoin Unlimited's broken model certainly is a serious matter.


There is no world where a deterministic, known value is safer than an unknown, dynamic, and possibly incorrect number (there's  no reason miners will even be honest in what their true EB values are).


Not sure why names are relevant, when ideas are easily described.  You don't have to be a game  theory expert to find holes in this proposal.  Your assertions that they wouldn't engage doesn't make it true.  There is an academic paper that already covers this subject describing selfish mining that cane easily be extended here.


Which is why I believe that the effective result of BU will be an unlimited block size with miners unable to reign in any miners who violate their EB values.


This may be why miners, users, and businesses are rejecting BU.


You mean when there was a fixed relay limit (which has been removed?)  Situations where 1MB is the max block size - which, by removing, changes the dynamics completely (e.g. a miner can't gain much of an advantage from 1MB, but very easily could by mining a 1GB block).


There's always been a block limit of 1MB.  The limit has not been "worked up".  Miners voluntarily mined smaller blocks, and that's it.


The miners mining BU have no intention of actually mining with the BU rules.  They are simply pawns in a political game involving Jihan Wu and Core.  This is why the only pool that actually forked off the network was Roger Ver's pool.  However, if mining is sufficiently centralized  (and they believe economic nodes will follow them), they would do it.  That's the other rub- the economic nodes will reject the BU blocks even if there was a vast majority of miners wishing to run it.


I agree with you on this, EB will be infinite and we will now have a system where the majority of miners can knock off the minority (unable to validate), and we run into a system where only a few datacenters can even validate transactions.  This is a dream scenario for those looking to co-opt the Bitcoin network.

A miner may prefer *not* to fork and may vote for the fork anyway, lessening his competition.  This has nothing to do with acquiring hash.
A miner may change his mind later (maybe the new fork isn't as profitable as he hoped).
A miner may increase his share by adding hashpower on the old chain (this his old vote is not representative of the hashpower at activation time, or even down the road).
This is why hard forks on minimal activation thresholds are very risky to those forking.

So a bartender at a restaurant is a client.  Interesting theory.


Actually, it did.  Ever since Satoshi changed the consensus code to be 1MB, it has been the rule.  Which is basically the vast majority of Bitcoin's life, and the even more vast majority of the time other people have used it.


And miners are perfectly free to mine altcoins to support this.  They cannot force users to accept this in place of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:15:15


It is allowed to be up to 4MB, and with typical transaction usage, would be around 2.1MB.


It sounds like you do not understand it.  SegWit blocks will be greater than 1MB (assuming they contain any SegWit tx and are full).  However, it is possible to construct a backwards compatible block for unupgraded nodes that is 1MB that they will accept.


I'm just basing it on current usage.  I would expect larger than that since when the price of something is lowered, you typically get more of it than before, so multi-sig now becomes cheaper.


I'm talking about BU, not a block size increase.  BU completely removes the ability of users to audit the blocks miners produce, and allows the majority of miners to create blocks that other miners cannot audit (thus drive them from the network).

This is not what BU does.
And you simply cannot change that number - you will need to have every single user (at least every user you want to participate) do it at the same instant.  Otherwise you need some type of trigger or flag date, which is more complex.  And you need everyone else to upgrade to the same thing.

So Coinbase is switching to Feathercoin?  It has a longer chain than Bitcoin.


Consensus, that word does not mean what you think it means.  I believe the word you are looking for is "signaling" or "approval".
Since Coinbase will "always support the longest chain in Bitcoin", does that mean if miners decide to mine 1GB blocks, and XT has an 8MB limit, that you will follow the 1GB chain?

I do not fear competition.  It's just working toward the same goals on the underlying layers that power everyone is more productive for all parties than reinventing the wheel over and over again.  This is why open source software has been so successful.  Spending twice the resources to produce the same thing, or slight variations, reinventing wheels, produces less.
All of those examples you list are based on the same base, the same protocol.  Sometimes collaboration is not possible and sometimes there are different goals trying to be accomplished, in which case, competition is more useful.

That's not true, otherwise it would switch to Feathercoin which is longer.  And even so, it ignores longer chains that follow different rules (XT would not follow a long 1GB block chain).


No, they use a much safer 95% threshold, and even so, soft forks do not require consensus.
@_date: 2016-01-11 16:22:12


That happens to a hard fork too, and is more likely.  In the hard fork case, these chains never get orphaned.  In a soft fork case, these blocks get quickly orphaned.  So hard forks are more dangerous in this case than soft forks.  It's even more so when the hard forks trigger at a very low activation rate (75% "support" is an example of guaranteeing two chains will exist for some time).


It may be informative, but only because it is riddled with errors and has been explained why it's wrong many times.  Mike continues to spout his incorrect views in spite of this criticism.  Mike seems to only care about his pet project, the unverified SPV case, and even in this case, soft forks can be set up such that unupgraded nodes do not recognize upgraded blocks (which is the hard fork behavior).


This is a false dichotomy.  Un-upgraded soft fork nodes are far more secure than un-upgraded hard fork nodes in terms of being fooled.  If I want to attack an unupgraded hard forked node, I just need a single block and as long as it takes to attack.  If I want to attack soft fork unupgraded nodes, I need to time it perfectly and only have a small window before my attack is removed.  And such an attack is entirely possible today through Finney attacks and are not unique to soft forks.

No, it wouldn't, because the small chain is valid on the big chain.  This means if the small chain ever is more valuable, miners will switch back and orphan the big chain, possibly months later.


No.  Validating nodes *need* to validate blocks, or else be subject to attacks by miners.

Merchant can accept RBF in many situations  just fine.  For example, the reddit gold scenario that recently came up.  User buys reddit gold with Bitcoin.  Even if it's 0-conf RBF, the merchant can accept the payment, and the user can have Gold turned on.  If the payment is reversed, the gold can be turned off, and the user possibly banned.
FSS-RBF does not solve many problems usefully.  The goal of RBF in this context is to allow for uncertainty of fees without overpaying.  The goal is to save you money and bump the fee when needed.  With FSS-RBF, you are forced to increase the transaction size every time you want to bump the fees.  This ends up with you paying more each attempt.  You also have a limited number of inputs to add, so you may need to try with higher fee jumps than you otherwise would try.  It's a nice idea in theory that does not work well in practice.

More than a centralized solution that offers nothing new except higher costs.
It may be that Bitcoin simply isn't terribly useful or just cannot have mass adoption while maintaining being decentralized.  That is unfortunate, but being mad about it won't change reality.  Blockchains do not scale, and just increasing capacity limits doesn't actually cause it to scale.
So rather than keep going down this lie, maybe its better to stop any investment that will be wasted in this area, and instead focus it on areas where scaling can occur.  I'm surprised this is controversial from a guy who started a company designed to actually help build solutions outside of the chain, but still get the security of the chain.  *That* is actually scaling.

You are correct that a minority fork could exist with a soft fork which would result in 2 chains existing for a long time (if not forever).  In the event a minority of miners and some users decide to use a soft fork, they would be on a chain with less work that could exist in perpetuity.  However, the activation thresholds are set such that this is very unlikely.
The miner support is not a proxy of consensus.  It is a proxy for determining whether there will be two chains existing for a long time.  When the miner support levels are high enough, this risk becomes low.  Miners could invoke an extremely unpopular change through soft fork with no regard for consensus (for example, miners could decide to never mine blocks bigger than 10KB, and orphan any miner who does). If they did this, and they had majority support of miners, no blocks would ever exist longer than a few confirmations that were bigger than 10KB.  Even if 100% of users were against this.

- Switching without an actual attack is unlikely to have consensus.

The word safe must first be defined.
The safest approach IMO would be to ensure widespread adoption of wallets that are aware of chain splits, and then force users into making an action before accepting one chain.  This can be useful even if there is no planned fork, just to see a transaction is in one block but not another when a normal orphaning occurs.

You are assuming a couple of things that probably are not true.
1)  The number of transactions remains constant, no matter what the block size.  This really isn't likely to be true - there only are room for N transactions at any interval in time, there's no reason to think that people don't change their behavior (move to off-chain/payment channels/alternatives/stop using) if they have little chance to get a payment in for a low cost.
2)  The protocol for broadcasting transactions does not change.  This is already unlikely to be true, as there will be little incentive to broadcast transactions that are unlikely to make it into blocks in the near future, or try to receive them.  New filters that allow nodes to communicate what an acceptable tx fee is to other nodes will allow them to keep the lowest value transactions from ever being broadcast to them.  This message is very cheap, and just requires a periodic update.
So fewer transactions will be passed around the network when the block size is N vs. 2N, assuming blocks are reasonably full at the 2N level and there is a backlog at N.

Each Bitcoin transaction consists of inputs and outputs.  The sum of the outputs minus the sum of the inputs is the fee.  There is no explicit fee.
So you can lower one of the outputs, and the fee goes up.  But you don't know which output are the "real" ones, so you'd have to keep them the same.  So you need to add an input (and another output).  Welp, that wasn't enough fee added, so time to try again.  Time, to add another input.  Eventually you run out of inputs.  And each time you try again, your transaction gets larger, making it more expensive!  So it's a pretty unworkable solution.

It's not a matter of seeing the big picture.  It's that their vote is not bound to anything.  They cannot trust their competitors are telling the truth.
You don't see how a false vote can harm them?  Let's say I control 25% of the network.  Say 45% of the network is voting for the change.  I can vote for the change, bringing it up to 70%.  This looks like a reasonable amount of miners.
Now you have 45% of miners going for the fork that will get orphaned.  You keep mining 1 MB blocks (there's no rule against this!), and outrun the other chain.  They get orphaned and lose all their work with no rewards.  It's pretty simple.  This is no different than selfish mining attacks, where I can get competitors to mine chains that will be orphaned, they lose, I win.
Miners in a pool cannot vote reliably by any means.  And miners in pools can change pools all the time.  The vote just is not reliable.  And someone may vote one way, and then the wind changes a little, and they see a profit opportunity on the other side.  Remember, there will still be some demand for 1MB blocks as there are significant people that will only support that chain.  Miners can find a much lower difficulty on that side (and potentially a lower price), and just decide to mine for profit.
You keep saying bigger picture, but miners cannot act collectively.  Study up on prisoners dilemma.  Unless you have miners actively have something to lose by voting differently than reality.

It doesn't require anything.  Users that want to use the stricter rules are free to do so.

There are plenty of ways to solve the unreliability problem, and assuming it would never be solved is silly.  Such static analysis without accounting for how things can easily change is worthless.
The idea miners could not include transactions is a fundamental misunderstanding of game theory.  Miners don't incur any additional costs other than propagation delays when including transactions.  Thus, if they decide to let transactions sit, their competitors will grab them and benefit.  The only way this works is if a cartel started orphaning blocks that included low-fee transactions.

Miners are smart enough to realize one coin is more valuable than mining one of two coins.  So they'll be smart to just check SegWit blocks, and not fork.

No one said it's on a whim.  The market signals the miner where to mine.  Most miners are in the business of making money, not dumping huge amounts of cash into idealism.  They will mine where it is most profitable.  They can make best guesses about what they think is profitable, and be wrong, and divert.  No business operates on perfect knowledge, and the smart ones are the ones that can see where they erred and quickly change paths.
A fake signaling is not risking any investment - perhaps he views the fork as a threat to the value of Bitcoin, so if he can trigger it, then make it work so badly that it collapses back to one, he can improve the value of Bitcoin.
But, the lack of adversarial thinking of the Classic team and supporters is why they end up taking stupid risks where there very obvious ways for it to fail.  They just can dismiss anything other than hoping for the best as FUD.

Great, guaranteeing a block is invalid can happen.  But you can't prove a block is "valid" with all rules a majority of miners use, so that's really not that useful.


And you cannot detect invalid transactions that miners decide to reject by orphaning in other ways.  You are no more vulnerable than before.


Great!  So once a lot of blocks stack on top of it, you know that block won't get orphaned, or at least it is very unlikely!  Just like any block you see.


And in this case, you need to make sure there is sufficient work on top of your block such that it won't be rejected.  Someone could send coins to an anyone can spend address in the past, and have those go to you, and that block could be orphaned down the road.  You are in the same boat.


How can you validate about mining rules they decide to enforce but not tell anyone?  


You can never guarantee detection of what miners consider invalid blocks.  You can only set your own rules for what you consider valid and invalid.

That's one scenario (out of the several I proposed).  They could even let Classic exist for a few days to make the effects even more devastating.  Who knows, maybe the miners can even open up a huge short position before the chaos and profit, especially if they are unlikely to be profitable in the future due to difficulty increases.
Classification as pariahs - what does this matter?  Mining isn't based on reputation.  Plus it's easy to spin it.  "We thought it had more support than it did, and wanted to have things return to safety since the other miners didn't come on board".  They could even just divert hashpower to other pools so that they don't even appear to switch back.  Lots of ways to do this.

Any successful hard fork will take more time and effort and add more risk than a soft fork like SegWit.  SegWit will also add true scalability of 1000x+ with enabling LN.  BU might be able to scale 2-4x at most before it starts seriously hurting the decentralized properties of Bitcoin.
Roger's argument that BTC Use drives value is incorrect.  People must want to hold a currency for it to have value.  It is true that someone may want to hold something because it can be easily spent, but people also hold things of value for other reason.  Gold is not easily spent but many people hold it and it gives it significant value.  The same is said of fine art, real estate, etc...
LN will allow increased security in spending (near instant payments without doublespend risks), with lower fees.  It's any wonder miners are against this proposal.  They want users like you to pay through the nose.  Roger is in bed with these miners, so don't think he's arguing for your benefit.

I don't need to trust any peer as I can verify the PoW in the header the merkle branch of my transactions myself.
You need to define what you mean by honest.  Satoshi has a clear definition that is often times misinterpreted by people wishing to get people to reduce their own security.  You seem to have a reasonable understanding of things, so I can only conclude you are intentionally trying to harm people by letting their guard down.

If they don't know what they need to attack, they can't plan.


Pretty easy to me, switch POW algorithm, problem solved.  They attack, do it again.  Each time they get virtually no benefit, and extreme cost.
Each attack costs hundreds of millions of dollars for a slight inconvenience on the network while people upgrade.  Not very smart.  Much better to just co-opt and regulate.

It's a super easy move, miners can just orphan any big blocks, and there are their fees.
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:24:47
The idea is Miners can vote on a block size limit.  You can use this basic idea however you want, but say miners wanted to increase tx fees by squeezing supply (cartel behavior/monopoly pricing), they signal what they want the next block size to be through signaling, and as long as enough miners are committed to the voting, they orphan any defectors.  A simple majority of miners can decide this.
@_date: 2016-01-29 21:20:19
Technically, there isn't a huge difference, and we probably do not need to diverge at this point.  But this argument is not really technical, it's about governance.


I'm not sure that's true.  Look at Gavin's own words on this. Gavin, even back in 2010, said he did not value the monetary value of Bitcoins, and held very few.  He viewed Bitcoin as a payment network, similar to VISA, where the value of your Bitcoins didn't matter.
Many share this belief.  But even if they do value it, many value it *less* than other properties, such as free/ultracheap transactions.   Yes, everyone wants to have an unlimited capacity, costless, fair, uncesnorable (ok not Hearn here), network.  But we have real engineering tradeoffs where you cannot have everything.  Everyone has different preferences on what tradeoffs they would make.
I'm curious, though, I'd be interested in a survey of what people view Bitcoin as - "A Payment Network" or "A Settlement Layer", assuming it can only be one.  I'm willing to bet a very high correlation between those who would prefer bigger blocks (say even 32MB or up) to the first, and those who prefer much smaller limits to be in the latter camp.
Fortunately, we are in a spot where it's possible to serve both.  That won't always be possible, and this conflict will re-emerge down the road (hopefully! It would be a sign of Bitcoin growing and becoming more useful).  Maybe there will be an answer then, or maybe not.  Maybe it's worth keeping those who want to go out to sea on the island for a little bit to increase chances of survival and maybe a passing ship goes past and can rescue them more safely.
And if this really is about increasing capacity, we aren't far off, so erring on the side of caution, and choosing a safe path through a tested deployment method that does not require kicking everyone who does not upgrade off the network would be the wise choice, and hopefully the stakeholders can come to this same conclusion.
@_date: 2016-01-30 22:42:59

Making consensus rules where fees are part of validity of blocks.  It's impossible to actually do anything.


This is not possible.  There  is no way to prove something did or didn't propagate through the network.  Miners can receive tx out of band.


Large miners have an advantage with big blocks since they have less orphan risk.  Therefore they will be more profitable, creating more miner centralization.

Volatility is not a zero sum game, as the cap has gone up considerably.  Trading is a zero sum game.
You are confusing Low Risk Safe Haven with store of value.
I am speculating that Bitcoin will be more useful as money in the future than it is now.  That's a great use case.  I can protect my savings by having it in a form of money that will grow in value rather than one that will shrink like fiat.
There are other use cases where it is more valuable, like cross-border payments, especially when payments are costly.  It's much cheaper for someone to send me Bitcoin than wire funds.  Also, it's a lot easier for me to do grey area things in Bitcoin, especially items that have huge amounts of fraud risk (gambling is a great one).
Remittances and micro-purchases are mostly areas where that Bitcoin is not particularly great.  Being able to send money regardless of what tyrannical regimes think, and without being able to inflate your money is the key use case.

Majority of hashpower, dingleberry.  It doesn't get orphaned because they have the majority.


It's the only logical one.  If you aren't using the Bitcoin network,  you aren't a user on it.  Any definition of distributed systems would work this way.  If you are not participating, you aren't a user.  Even if you ask someone who is.


Not all nodes are created equally, but nothing about a UASF  says only exchanges.  It's possible exchanges are enough to drive miners to their senses, but all users should upgrade.


No, I've been a Bitcoin user and in the guts of the technical mix for 6 years now.  I don't need to read propaganda to understand how it works.  It seems clear you do  not understand what a UASF is.  Guess you will have to learn the hard way.

The biggest risk is sending coins post-fork.  You end up sending transactions that are valid on both chains, so you may end up giving someone coins on a chain you didn't intend!
But expect transactions to be heavily backlogged as miners split, and people rush to try to split coins!
@_date: 2016-01-22 22:01:27

Bitcoin will not be able to compete on price long term.  It only can do this now because it is funded by massive amounts of inflation.  This will end.  If the goal of Bitcoin was to make a cheap payment network, it could be done *much* better with a different design.

Yes, that's correct RBF has no restrictions on how things change.  FSS RBF requires an additional input and output, and the original outputs to be identical.

Determining consensus isn't something you can have a formal process for.  It's challenging, and it's one of the reasons why hard forks are difficult.  In some cases, there will be no reasonable disagreement (say there was a nasty bug that required a hard fork to fix, and everyone agreed it was a good idea except people trying to troll).
Miners have veto power in backward compatible hard forks.  That's simply because they can reject the new rules and keep mining on the existing rule set, and nothing can stop them.  What miners think doesn't always align with everyone else, and whats good for large miners may not be good for small ones.
Large companies can give opinions on what they might think is best, but what they think is best does not always align with Bitcoin users.  For example, large companies have an incentive to make their importance greater, and if no one was able to run a node but large companies, these companies would gain at the expense of users.
Developers can also give opinions on what they feel is safe and can choose what to work on.  They cannot be coerced into developing solutions they feel are unsafe any more than a doctor can be coerced into performing an unsafe medical procedure.  They can be nothing more than advisors.
Users can decide what rules to follow and what software to run and what companies to use.  They have the ultimate power.  If there is consensus from users, then a hard fork would be far less dangerous.  I think we are close to consensus that a 2MB bump is probably safe.
If a hard fork occurs, all of the above have some choice but also are somewhat restricted.
Businesses will have to follow what people want.  Miners will only mine what makes sense to mine.  The ratio of price to difficulty of each fork will give them direction on where to mine, and most will act in what gives them the most profits.  Developers will work on whatever project interests them most or whatever they are paid to do.  Users will use the fork provides the most utility.
If all of these align on a single fork, with a tiny minority on the other side, then you have clear consensus.  Yes, it's hard, if not impossible to measure for all but the most obvious changes.  But that's why Bitcoin is great.  It's not a democracy subject to the whims of masses.  It's incredibly hard to change in ways that don't benefit all.

Ah, economics, the pseudoscience degree!
Use whatever terms you want, its just semantic nittery.  Finance will be a different animal simply because how books work.
Terms I find useful:
Speculation: buying something in the hopes that someone else finds it more useful in the future.
Investing: Taking something now and making something that will produce more value in the long run.
Store of Value: I wish to defer consumption to a later date and do not want to lose purchasing power.
All of the above have no specific time horizons.  
As for the value, you are right about transaction medium giving value.  It depends on velocity more than anything.  Velocity can be quite fast with Bitcoin, although the cost and time spent with offramps and onramps might make people hold longer than they might otherwise choose to.
Speculation actually allows these other use cases, as it gives underlying value and provides liquidity to those using it as a transaction medium.  There's blind speculation, where people buy something they know would provide no use, but hope to find a greater fool, and there's speculating in an asset where you might have better knowledge of the future than others.  People can and do speculate in naked assets that are simply used to dump to someone else, and while there likely are some speculators in Bitcoin who believe it will crash to 0, quite a lot are more focused on the being ahead of the curve.
I expect the biggest gain in use case is those wishing to store wealth beyond the controls of others.  The transaction medium *can* give some value as people choose to hold cash over other assets due to liquidity and unexpected opportunities/costs of cashing out of other assets.  I hold enough cash reserves to be able to spend on things I may need (or know I need in the future) and wish to avoid the pain/cost of cashing out more productive assets.  As Bitcoin grows as a transaction medium, it becomes more valuable to keep a Bitcoin reserve.  This happens when it's more beneficial for me to use Bitcoins (maybe Bitcoin is the only payment method, maybe it's cheaper).

The first is to understand how Bitcoin transactions work, because how they are displayed to users is not typically how they are constructed under the hood, and this adds to confusion.
Think of Bitcoin existing as a sets of coins with different amounts of metal in them.  These are what you were previously paid.  So if someone sends you a coin with 1.01BTC, and someone else sends you a coin with .75BTC, you have both coins in your coin purse.
A transaction is handing some of your coins to a miner with instructions on how to make new coins.  You could hand him the 1.01 BTC coin, and tell the miner to make a .25BTC (and send to a merchant) and a .75BTC (and send back to yourself), and keep the .01BTC as a fee.  The miner melts the coins down, then creates 3 new coins (one for the miner, one for the merchant, one for the change).  The important part is you have to melt the entire coin.
There is no indication to the miner which coin is the change and which is the payment.  In fact, you could have only one output, you could have 20 outputs.  The miner doesn't know if you are paying .75 to the merchant or as change.  So there is no indication of what the "payment" is.  So FSS works by ensuring that every coin that was previously requested is AT LEAST as big as before.  The only way to increase the fee is to add an extra coin to the mix.  This makes the instructions longer, and more expensive.
There is simply no way to know what is change and what isn't.

75% is not a hard rule for BU (BU has no rules, only "emergent consensus").  They are free to fork off at 72%, 61%, or 51% (or even 2%, as Roger's pool attempted).
If SegWit got something like 80-85% on the Bitcoin chain after BU forkers forked off, it wouldn't be unreasonable to see a few remaining miners signal.

No, because miners had minimum fees (or priority requirements).  They also couldn't go past the 1MB limit.  So much for my business plan to store DVDs on the blockchain, and give people encryption keys to play them.  So the demand was there!  There was never a time where miners would mine for free.

Yes, the block gets eventually validated.  But in the mean time, only the miner who created it can include transactions (and gain fees and extra revenue).  Thus it has an edge.
Not sure why you are talking about 2MB - everyone agrees 2MB is safe.  We are talking about removing the limit, and what would happen without it.

Core has proposed an increase that goes to 4MB, safely.

There is value and there is utility, and these things are different (though sometimes related).

Unfortunately the day of separate pool operators and hashpower is mostly over.  Mining operations require enough capital investment now and have advantages of economies of scale such that they run their own pools (and let others contribute, because might as well gain even more advantages with being a large pool).

95% vs. 5% means that you'd likely get lucky with 90% pretty often, and 10 to 1 ratio cripples the other chain pretty bad to a halt.  This means the minority chain could be attacked reasonably cheaply without giving up much on the main chain and the confirm time would take multiple months to adjust without manual intervention.
94% would probably work! 98% is safer but a 10 to 1 margin is likely sufficient.
There's no magic number.  75% is definitely too small for obvious reasons.

Hashrate and economic majority are different things.  We do not want a system where a small number of miners can force users into an undesirable change.  Miners must ensure that people actually want their coins they mine, and the economic majority (independent of miners) decide this.

2) You follow a fork that appears to have support, but turns out does not.  A few weeks later, miners retreat back to the original fork and orphan the forked chain, leaving everyone who got coins on the new fork emptyhanded.

You don't need a finite resource for it to apply.  You just need something where one person benefits and it makes it worse for others.  Pollution is another great example.
Users of Bitcoin want the chain to be as small as possible (to make it easier for them to verify), but need it to include as many other people as possible to give Bitcoin value.  It's a trade-off.
The last fish has value, yes, but fisherman end up with increased costs and not as much benefits.  You end up with something less desirable and fisherman are worse off than if they self-policed.


Fortunately these attempts have failed.


Except miners are not a uniform entity and compete with each other.  They would need to self-police for this to work, and even then, the benefits of miners may be enough to make it slightly worse for everyone else.

With BU, the majority of miners have the power to generate blocks too large for many users to validate. What part of that is even remotely controversial?


If you aren't operating a node, you aren't a user in the system.  You are merely a customer of someone who is a user.


It's obfuscated.  I read a good article about it. 


Large miners have the power to create blocks so large small miners cannot validate them.  So small miners join bigger pools.  Large miners also have the ability to safely create blocks without the risk of being orphaned (small miners don't know what the majority will try to orphan or not, but large miners can guarantee they won't be orphaned).


This is incorrect.  Miners choose what order of transactions to include in blocks.  That's it.


Users have the vast majority of the power now.  BU is like a voluntary surrender of arms, typically something most dictators try to get their citizens to do before becoming tyrannical.

10% does not fork off unless they change the rules to invalidate.  In that case, the fork is not at risk of being orphaned, only attacked.
In the case where 60% break off, and the new rules are compatible with the old rules (1MB blocks are valid in 2MB limit, for example), if 15% of miners switch back, they end up orphaning the 2MB chain and both chains converge.  This is really bad to anyone on the 2MB chain.

Agreed - if you select a single trusted node, you trust that node (and if you operate it, you are trusting yourself/your networking/key management abilities to not get an impersonator pretending to be your node).


Yes, you need an actual node for this, not a light node. Whether its your personally controlled node or not, you need to select a trusted node.
The point is, any kind of "light" node setup, where you still are peering with parties on the network, you are vulnerable to a single node who produces a block that has enough work, but is invalid, and that single node can overrule an entire sea of honest nodes you are connected to.


Not sure where mining came into play here, but the point is without a full node (or relying on a full node someone else operates), you trust the miners (or the weakest of the set of nodes you connect to).

51% attacks are not free.  They cost real resources and have opportunity costs.  So it's possible to perform a double spend, but he has a cost. 
If you receive payment of a significant enough value that it is cost effective for someone to attack you, you should wait until sufficient work until the attack is not economical (be sure to account for cases where the attacker has done this to multiple people, so a $1MM value might take $10MM to attack, but if he does it to 15 people, it's proftable).


If no one validates, then not only can a miner double spend, but he can create coins out of thin air.  This means rather than having to own $15MM of Bitcoins to try to double spend, he now can just do it without even purchasing coins, and even try for $200MM without any cost.  The attack vector is exponentially wider.


Trying to discourage people from defending themselves makes me wonder why you would honestly tell how PoW security even works.
@_date: 2017-03-30 13:55:07
That's exactly what a soft fork does.   A soft fork is a tightening of rules.  A soft fork uses economic incentives to ensure that miners follow that path.  This does not always work immediately.  BIP66 had miners signal they would support it, but they didn't (due to SPV mining).  This lead to a chain split.
While a UASF can lead to messier situations than a MASF, there is no fundamental difference.  A MASF can still have miners be incorrect and lead to chain splits.  Economics is the driver in both cases - if the chain with the tighter rules produces more value to users, then miners will choose to mine that to sell their coins at a premium.


I believe a few miners have already signalled support for this chain, so I think you are off there.  If the economy is behind this chain, some miners will enforce it, and if economics are there, all will follow (though some reluctantly).  Just like BIP66.

Yes, we are. Key management is only one component. With all, you could theoretically have a custodial key management done, even your own full node! For example, I could have custodian accept a payment for me, but I could still monitor it got paid with my full node.
As for how your wallet monitors transactions, there are three main flavors:
1) Full node - fully validates every block since genesis and uses combination of PoW and consensus rules to determine the UTXO set.
2) Trusted node - same as 1, except it's not under your control. 
3) "SPV" node - connects to "random" nodes, which will use the proof of work of a block to try to show validity of a block (the idea here is that miners will have a costly attack to cheat in this system because most full nodes of economic value will reject their blocks). However, you are now basically passing your economic value to all other full nodes in terms of consensus rules being enforced.
With  you have your choice of providers who you can trust. For  you can't. You are simply relying on the miners acting in an economic interest aligned with your own, which depends on other people in camps  and  If  grows large enough (or  and  operators wish to have changes), then miners basically can change the rules, and you may no longer even be able to validate your money, even if you wanted to.
In all three, you can have your own keys or not. That's irrelevant. Blockchain.info wallets - you have your own keys. Coinbase wallets - you have your own keys. But if their node decides that B2X or some other fork is Bitcoin, you'll never know you weren't really paid.
Luke's extremism is what keeps Bitcoin valuable. We need more Luke's being extreme. This is why Bitcoin didn't get co-opted, like ETH did.
I also would like to make it clear, trusting others is not necessarily the problem. It's less of a problem when you choose who you can trust. I trust that my wife won't slit my throat in the middle of the night, even though I know she could. I wouldn't trust some random hobo off the street with that. I might distrust Coinbase, but trust a specific Electrum server. That's all pretty reasonable. Maybe I trust Coinbase won't scam me because I can sue them if they lie to me. I would not, however, just trust miners, who I have no clue who they are, and could change very easily, especially based on incentives, who can anonymously attack without any recourse. That's a big difference and the issue with anything that's simply looking at PoW chains to decide validity.

Yes.  This is trivial to do, since one chain will contain more transactions than the other, thus you just send a transaction that is likely to get confirmed on one and not on the other, and then double-spend on the small network with a high fee once it was accepted on the large network.


Yes, which is why your thesis that there is no demand for alt-chains is wrong.


Maybe, but those small people is what gives Bitcoin all of its value (HODLers).


A contentious hard fork should not be pushed.  That's different than saying never hard fork.


The blocksize is entirely relevant to a full node - as it is a consensus rule.


I don't think you understand how SW works.  Old transactions work fine.  Only new transactions are affected.  All new style transactions also are validated as true.  It's possible you see a block that will get orphaned due to the new style transaction failing a new rule, but a block *also* could get orphaned today with the same affect.  So there is no security change.


Correct.  A soft fork is risky to miners who do not upgrade.  A hard fork is risky to EVERYONE who does not upgrade.

@_date: 2016-03-04 21:24:18


Great.  So you can validate a block.  That doesn't mean miners won't decide to orphan it for any reason they choose.  You have *zero* guarantee a mined block that is valid will ever be part of the longest chain, nor will it be in the future.


The only way this happens is if you *asked* for money in SW.  As for being in a block - this is true for ALL blocks - all blocks *may* be orphaned.  Plan accordingly.


Great, and this is also true that miners could choose to arbitrarily orphan *any* block for *any* reason.  Just because you find a block is valid doesn't mean miners won't abandon it.  So nothing changes with SW - miners are just choosing to abandon some blocks.  You need to be prepared for this *anyway*.

That is not what consensus means except in crazy-XT land.
And even so, even in crazy-XT land, the longest chain is still ignored if it violates rules it sets (you couldn't create 42 million coins in XT even with a long chain, you couldn't send 8GB blocks now, etc...).

There is no way to know if it adds more value than the fees.  It's pure speculation.  Meanwhile, fees are rising and continue to rise, and miner are raking it in.  Bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

This is wrong, because you can't tell who is honest. You can only tell who has the most work, and use that to define honesty. You have nothing else you can use, so you are essentially trusting the miners out of the peers you select (either random peers or a select set of peers). You could of course go into safe mode (shut down, alert the user) if multiple trusted nodes end up on different paths, but you could never have a functional fake-spv node follow that kind of rule.

There are two ways you could increase things -aggregate and individual ownership.
However, it comes down to cost benefit.  If there are large scale users, they are likely to check.  Small scale ones get pushed off.
But if I have to tolerate spam and the only benefit is a few more nodes online for checking their property titles, screw em, they can use systems designed for that and timestamp in Bitcoin.

This is the case for every soft fork ever.  Those nodes never can fully validate the new rules.  It is backwards compatible because those nodes are still able to function and simply see something they know they can't understand and ignore it.


Yes, miners now can create bloat blocks that users/other miners cannot validate in BU.  If they have sufficient hashpower, users must accept these blocks due to AD settings.


I'm well aware of how it's disguised to work.
@_date: 2016-01-13 00:55:43
The goal is to minimize viability of two chains existing at the same point.  It's a subjective tradeoff between a "troll" vote stopping it vs. the bad situation of having two chains.  Yes 95% is an opinion because there is no objective right answer, other than some answers being obviously bad (100% is obviously bad because 1 bad block by someone wanting to obstruct can do so, and 50% is clearly too low because the risk of orphaning is too great).

There are multiple digital currencies.  What there hasn't been, is fracturing and splitting.  Once the rules are subject to change based on the whims of masses and whatever lies are fed to miners, nothing is sacred, and there is no reason to trust anything in it.

Sure if the UAF coins are worth more, then miners would probably switch and reorganize the legacy chain, but this a very dangerous situation which will interrupt all bitcoin businesses.
Businesses should prepare and be aware.  A few days of miners being hardheaded is a lot easier to deal with than a soft fork and will provide businesses with immediate benefits.


A chain split is unlikely to last more than a few days (if it even occurs).  Unlike a hard fork, a chain split is not permanent.  Replay protection is not needed.  During a chain split, users should exercise caution and ensure they are paid on both chains.

I sell hotdogs for $5.  They cost me $1 each to make.  I sell 200 hot dogs per day.
According to this logic, I should sell 400 hot dogs per day!  Then I can make 2x as much!  Except it doesn't work this way.  The only way I sell 400 hot dogs is if I lower my price.  So it depends greatly at where I have to cut my price to whether or not I make more money.  If I lower it to $2.50, I end up with the same revenue, but less profits.  If I could sell at $3, I end up with the same profit for 2x as much work.  If I sell for $4 each, I end up with more profit!
You need to understand the demand curve (quantity demanded at each potential price) to understand what your revenue will do at various price points.

Just because an alert is out doesn't mean it is zero risk.  Software upgrades must occur.  People must get the software, install it.  For large organizations this takes manpower and effort.  It still took miners 36 days to upgrade the last soft fork, even though it only took a handful of actual machines to change.
We still need software and to test it before even scheduling such a flag day, which is at least 2 months away.  How much time do you feel is reasonable after having a release candidate and sufficient testing to deploy?

Not true.


Also not true (existing users can increase holdings to grow price)

The 20MB number was completely untested and even once basic tests showed it was completely unworkable, it was revised to 8.  The 8 number was chosen exclusively because it was a "lucky number" in Chinese.  But that number was tested and communicated with miners, and was also found to be unsafe.  I want to thank for his work on this.
I don't think anyone is objecting to 2MB at this point.  What we want to do is to get something deployed as fast as safely possible and with benefits to help enable massive scaling in the future.  A hard fork requires a greater deal of coordination and cannot be rushed out safely.  On the other hand, SW as a SF can be deployed quickly and safely, and has code ready.
We all want to scale as much as reasonably possible.  Unfortunately the technical reality is that it is not really safe to increase blocks by a huge amount right now.  I also want to thank for his work helping to close an attack vector against bigger blocks with his signature limitation.
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:03:05


It does this by moving data to a place that existing clients don't know to look for it, and in a way that lets them know they don't fully understand it.  It's exactly doing this, allowing blocks to grow up to theoretically up to 4MB.


This is incorrect. On Testnet, there were already Segwit blocks above 3.5MB.  It LITERALLY is bigger.


Not without completely breaking compatibility with the existing network or making it so that old nodes are unable to see the new transactions completely.  


This is incorrect.

Speculation and gambling are not the same thing.  Speculating is finding an asset that is undervalued at one point in time and bringing it to a future time where it is more valuable.  This is no different than taking food to an area that has a food shortage (and high prices) from an area where food is cheap and plentiful.  This is like saying the transportation industry is not a use case because it moves goods from less needed places to more needed.  Speculation needs not be random or guessing, but educated guesses.

I was talking about BlockFi. But even for Gemini, a lot of times this insurance only protects against certain kinds of losses. And insurance companies can go bust as well, which for an asset like Bitcoin if a large portion was lost or stolen and had to be repaid, it would create a massive spike in the market to the point insurance companies could not rebuy it.

A miner activated soft fork is subject to the same surface vector - miners signaling does not guarantee they actually will enforce it.  We saw this in the past with BIP66.
Miners have a good incentive to quickly resolve a chain split, and this can be done by setting up a border node to make sure they don't mine on top of invalid SegWit blocks.  If not, they will lose money.
@_date: 2017-03-04 18:33:06
Fees can be gamed.  You can pay miners out of band, they can rebate out of band, etc...  Centralizing prices rarely works.
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:19:17
If I understand this correctly, then there are two different block formats (one sent to old nodes, and one sent to SegWit compatible nodes)?  Is this correct?

I agree that 5% hashpower will have a lot of trouble due to possibility of attack being so great and fairly cheap.
The mistake is thinking things are permanent.  A 75% vote does not guarantee 75% support, there are a few charts which shows when you have a true support of 70% or so, you are likely to activate it after a lucky streak.  For example, a coin flip will be heads 50% of the time (true support of heads = 50%), but if you flip a coin in a row over and over, and stop whenever you demonstrate 70% support (7 out of a streak of 10 flips), you can guarantee it won't take very long to trigger the coin being at 70% support.  1000 blocks is a fairly significant amount, but over a long enough period of time, 65-70% of hashpower will be enough to trigger it.  Also the voting mechanism makes miners have nothing at stake by changing  their mind or voting intent.  Say a fork was showing around 45% support and I controlled a mining pool of 20%.  I could get 45% of my competitors to mine a worthless fork simply by activating the fork through signalling, then never mining on it.  They end up mining a few blocks every now and then, then getting outran, and lose money.  They can't figure out what is going on.  I may even help them build up the chain a little then go back and orphan them.  So 75% is far from anything certain.
If the miners did actually split 75/25, both chains remain usable.  The new chain is somewhat slower, and the old chain is only 25% slower in getting blocks.  After one difficulty period (8 weeks in this case), the difficulty would reset and the fork resumes normal speed.  To attack the small fork, a full 1/3 of miners need to pull off to actively attack.  By doing this, they forgo any benefits of mining their fork, which is costly.  Compare this to only having 1/19 attack in the 95% case.  It's a *huge* difference.  So the smaller fork could survive for some time without much usability loss and with less risk of attack.  Then it comes down to price.  Miners will, inevitably, mine on the fork that gives them the most profit.  Miners will choose this based on only two parameters - price and difficulty.  Fees *may* play a role if things get crazy, but that's just another advantage for the small blocks.  If the price of the small coin is 30% of the price of the large coin, but has 25% the difficulty, miners will switch until they hit equilibrium.  We see this with alt-coins all the time.  The equilibrium will be ensure the ratio of miners on each fork matches the ratio of prices.  This means the new fork *must* stay at a higher price to survive.  The second it doesn't, miners abandon it and return to the original fork, dooming the new fork and all of the transactions on it.  Eventually the old fork wins, and everyone who had new coins are out of luck.
The 75% case *may* work out if it can turn into a groundswell of support, but 25% is a pretty significant amount actively not wanting something.  Add in that users preferences do not always match miners hashpower alliances, and you could have it get ugly.  The prices of both forks have a great chance of both cratering during the chaos, adding to miner confusion and switching.  In times of chaos, people tend to retreat to safe havens, and in this case, it would be the original rules.
This is why such a low threshold is dangerous and risky, even if you agree with it.

I reserved Bitcoin Classic about 7 months ago (far before this project) anticipating that a contentious hard fork may occur.  I believed the name "Classic" to be a good name for following the original rules, and kept it, just in case.  This was around the time where was constantly being brigaded and any post against XT was downvoted to oblivion.  I created Classic as a place to continue on a decentralized version of Bitcoin to allow those who wanted to keep running the project to talk.
Fast forward 7 months and I found out that the latest coup attempt used the same name as the space I was holding in case someone attempted a coup.  Quite ironic.
I was then approached by some of the Classic maintainers to transfer the name.  They wouldn't tell me what it was for, so I held it.

You keep assuming that BU developers are competent enough to pull this off and that miners would join them in an attack.  The attackers would have to outnumber the non-attackers.  Lots of big if's.  And the only thing it would accomplish is a POW fork.

Not sure 100%.  Would have to run the math.  If I randomly connect to nodes, I just need 1 honest node to avoid a sybil.  Say I open 8 connections.  There are N total nodes and M nodes that will try to attack me.  The odds of not having an honest peer is 1-(M/N)^8.  So if N increases, I need to increase M to have the same rate, although that assumes peers are random and they aren't isolating me in other ways.
I would say that a regular user is far less likely to do a sybil attack, so the more regular users spinning up full nodes, the less likely I am to be attacked.  If you have a situation where it's costly, you may end up with more nodes, but more % of attackers, which affects security.  The more nodes who rely on less security (unverified SPV vs. full), the more the incentive to attack.  For example, if I want to attack people and no one uses SPV, I wouldn't try an attack.  If half people do, it becomes more profitable and if 90% do, I can execute an attack much more successfully on them.

You are comparing apples to oranges.

Nothing is "changed" in this case.  Old nodes validate just fine.  95% is designed to protect miners and SPV users.  95% may be too restrictive, but if I'm going to err, it's on safety over upgrades.

Say there are 2 chains, 1 with honest miners and 1 with dishonest, and the dishonest ones have more PoW.  
If you connect via fake-SPV mode (aka Hearn SPV), you peer with a bunch of random nodes. If you connect to a single node that follows the more-work but dishonest chain, you will ignore EVERY other node that tells you the truth. It uses PoW as the tiebreaker for any disputes between the nodes you connect to.
You have no idea if the full nodes you connect to are actual Bitcoin nodes or some variant with a different ruleset.

It's pretty much the same UX as before - you see it's sent from your phone, your wallet knows it sent it, and you can see that.  The vendor's UX remains the same - they have no payment until there is confirms, and can tell you that.




Unfortunately this feedback is often wrong and useless, as a vendor seeing it means nothing about whether it ever will get mined.  It causes a lot of UX issues when it's marked as received, but never gets confirmed.  Rather than rely on a false indicator, instead, it is better to provide accurate feedback "Pending Receipt, 0 Confirms".

@_date: 2016-06-10 14:03:52
It's not a distinction in the terms it was used, only by those who interpret things colloquially (either for their own benefit, or out of ignorance).
Think about some different monetary instruments:
* Cash
* Personal Checks
* Bank Checks
* Traveler's Checks
* Money Orders
* Securities
* Monetary Commodities (gold/silver)
* Credit
All are forms of money, but have different properties. 
Cash typically refers to a physical coin or bill that is a bearer asset.  This means that it is immediately settled upon receipt.  We rely on an issuer of the cash to create a difficult to counterfeit money (stamping a coin, printing a bill) and also rely on the issuer not to inflate the money supply (which will devalue it).
Checks do not settle upon transmission.  A check is a written promise to take something from someone's account.  A check is redeemed at the institution that created it, and is debited from the receivers account and credited to the bearer of the check.  If the funds are not there, the bearer of the check is out of luck.  Banks may initially credit your account before this verification occurred (which sometimes can take weeks due to banking inefficiencies and legacy systems), but if the check actually bounces, they'll take the money out of your account.
Gold/Silver functions much like cash, except there is no central authority issuing it.  Banks may stamp gold or silver coins to make it easier to verify them, though.  Bearer assets.
Securities can be in several categories - some can be bearer assets, some can be more like checks, it depends.
Credit is similar to a check, except there is less risk for the merchant, as the issuer of the card vouches for the funds and if the creditor does not pay, the issuer of the card is on the hook for squaring up.
If Bitcoin is digital cash, it *must* be a settlement network.  Any deviation from that leaves it as something other than cash.  While Bitcoin is not physical like other forms of cash, the digital nature of it is the only thing that distinguishes it from cash's other properties, and cryptography ensures that it cannot be copied, like other digital assets.
The P2P part refers to the issuer.  Rather than have a central bank, we have a decentralized set of issuers that is verified by peers of the network.  Miners can issue the coins, and users can ensure the supply is not being inflated any differently than the promise of the design of the network (50 coins, then 25 coins, then 12.5 coins per block, etc...).
So rather than having a centrally issued physical cash, we have a Peer to Peer, digital cash.  Substituting physical digital, and centrally issued with peer to peer, you can see the key differences between Bitcoin and other forms of cash.

They can cheat, at great expense.  That's always been the case.  The benefit of cheating must be greater than the cost of executing (including opportunity cost) the attack for Bitcoin's security model to work.  A government who wishes to attack Bitcoin would be far more likely to employ other methods to attack, such as ordering miners to only mine transactions they find valid (much cheaper than making your own chips and taking over).
To profit by cheating, typically that's done through a double-spend.  Which is why you need to be careful for such attacks when releasing goods to those you don't have recourse against.

@_date: 2017-03-07 17:07:30


That is true.  This is why it's important to validate!  Too many people have gotten careless and assume good faith when they shouldn't.


The way to check is simple.  You make a fork, and if it has economic majorities behind it, it orphans the other chain.  If it doesn't, then you don't have it.  Life is uncertain.  Even if miners signal support, it doesn't mean they actually would support it (see BIP 66).  Users must protect themselves.

Jevon's Paradox might mean more demand for on-chain transactions. The amount of transactions aren't constant. Liquid will be more expensive than Bitcoin (at least at today's fees), so it's more of a "premium" way to send money.


Reasons for using Lightning really aren't just about fees, it's about speed and micro-payments. Many lightning payments would be uneconomical *today* even when we don't have much fee pressure. Or even in the past. For example, you can make payments smaller than even can be made on some of the cheapest, crappiest altcoins with Lightning.

I haven't been able to, nor has anyone else at this point.  Sure, it's not impossible, but we have to work with the possibility that it might not.


No one is saying it isn't possible ever, but it just isn't known now.  For example something like Mimblewimble shows that perhaps maybe it is, with some changes.  But what is known is that what is known today simply does not scale without sacrificing quite a bit (and at which point, you might as well just remove POW and make a database updated on a central ledger).
Things do not come into existence through wishing and hoping.  They come into existence through hard work and research.  I'm sure we all would wish for flying cars and all that, but reality is it's not really very efficient compared to the alternatives.  Does that mean they will be impossible forever?  No.


Decentralization is definitely not Boolean.  Some things are more decentralized than others, and measurably so.  


So put it on a central server, that's the lowest amount of decentralization possible.  Call it PayPal....


Thank goodness you do not decide this.  


Miners are honest because they are audited by the entire network.  Remove this auditing capability and you change the incentive structure considerably.
Just because it's hard to measure or isn't an exact number, doesn't mean it's something that should be thrown away.
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:39:21
But Segwit *does* address scaling (both immediate, on-chain scaling, and allows for easier applications where off-chain becomes more trustless).
They are not independent in the current form.  If SegWit did not have a blocksize increase, then you could perhaps argue, but it does.


But it also is about replacing block size with block weight.  Segwit transactions do not save space (in fact, they take up a small amount more space).  They increase capacity.

So SegWit meets this definition, as it is covered in the POW hash.  But this is a poor definition, because something that anchors into the Bitcoin blockchain (say a hash of a set of documents), is also part of that hash.

They would all be in a single transaction in.  There is no way to know multiple funders of an escrow balance because multiple UTXO's go into inputs anyway.  You have no idea if it's coming from the same source or not.  Paying out would have to be defined as well with new addresses.
Obviously I will want to make sure Bruce is on board, and having a 2/3 multisig would be ideal for the addresses to make sure Bruce doesn't run with it (trust Bruce, but why add the risk if I don't need to).

Griefing Unlimited nodes isn't pointless.  And if your goal is to reduce bandwidth for peer nodes (who won't care as much about latency), they can just use "blocksonly" mode.  XThin cannot improve upon that since its the bare minimum of what needs to propagate.

51% means that for $12,000 you could send 49% of the miners on a wild goose chase mining invalid blocks. SPV users would get confused, and unupgraded nodes would follow the wrong chain and people would lose money.
It also means that dumb luck or fake signalling could easily make the activation a fraud, and not really the majority.

First, addresses don't have "balances". Second, if you want to do this, you import the address you care about into the wallet, and rescan from the block you want to start looking from. If you generate an address in a wallet outside of core, just import it into the node before you receive any funds and you'll be able to track it.

It may take some raw transaction manipulation to get it done without a native wallet (keep key wherever you want and use to sign when conditions are right).  For the stakes involved, that can be verified by whoever you need.  If btc1 does implement replay protection then perhaps there is a way to automate it even without escrow.

We already have seen a significant amount of hashpower already defect to BCH.
It's utterly stupid to think that miners will follow anything other than the most profitable chain long term.


Without explicit action accepting it, they stay with the current chain.  So the burden is on the forkers.

This can be done, but it would result in a chain split between nodes that did not upgrade and those that did.  SPV wallets would likely follow the hashpower.  In the event of overwhelming support from the ecosystem and the miners refusing to go along, this could be done.  Miners that don't go along would mine low-value coins that only a few people would recognize, thus they would have to come along.  Without the overwhelming support, you end up with a chain split, a loss of the network effect, and likely a lot of lost money.  Unless the change is something that injects a ton of value into the network, it's probably not a price worth paying.  This is the same reason forkers haven't forked with a minority of hashpower yet as well (They could fork right away, but they know they would lose).


Unfortunately Bitcoin's largest flaw having miners validate blocks.

Your examples aren't really how Bitcoin works.  Are you a new user?  If so, I can show you how it's different.


Not sure what scenario this is supposed to represent. Every wallet I've ever used, tells you that it was able to broadcast a transaction to the network or not.  I've never seen anything equivalent to this in any wallet.


This sounds like the experience of using a wallet, having the wallet attempt to broadcast, and either being told it won't pass on the transaction for whatever reason, or it is successful.  In the Bitcoin case, there is no way to know if the waitress actually tells the cook to make it or not.  There's no way to tell if the cook has decided to make different orders instead of yours, even if he did get the order.  The cook might decide he'd rather work on a large order, or create pizzas for his friends instead.  The fact that the waitress told you anything back is somewhat useful, but doesn't tell you much.  In this case, your peers that reject or accept your transaction are equivalent to the waitress, and DO give you that feedback.


I have no idea what this scenario is.  Block explorers don't really give you any insight on whether a transaction will be mined or not.  It's a distraction of information if anything, giving you something you think might be useful, and when it's not, you get angry and yell at the pizza place.

I didn't claim you were wrong.  I said the argument doesn't follow.
For example.  All humans are mammals.  Sam is a mammal.  Therefore Sam is a human.
I can point out how the conclusion does not follow.  That does not mean Sam *isn't* a human - he might be, or he might not be.  The point is, you have provided no evidence he *is* a human.  You claim he is a human, and want me to claim he "isn't a human". Sorry dear, logic doesn't work with that.  Those making claims are the ones that need to back them up, not wait for someone to "disprove it".
But in any case, in this situation, Sam *might* be a gorilla, so that proves the logic is invalid.
In your case, while the investment in mining likely is to increase during a price rise, it could follow that those who are already large miners just increase disproportionately compared to everyone else, leaving your statement about "price rise will lead to more mining hashpower" true, but your conclusion is not true (in this case) because the large miners just gained compared to everyone else.

This assumption isn't true.  It requires their costs be less than their revenue.  Eliminating competition is another way to maximize profits.


BU does not allow users to follow the hashpower when it comes to block rewards, block time, validity of signatures.  For example, maybe the majority of miners will want to roll back a theft - users prevent that by validating signatures.  Take a stand for Nakamoto consensus, and allow miners to decide once and for all who the rightful owners of coins are.  After all, they have an incentive to make the price high.

The signal doesn't even have an effect.  It's worse.  Even if it was perfect, miners will just proceed how they want, since the max depth acceptance just means they keep going, and eventually everyone falls in line.

No, there's no way to prove you are actually running BU, which is a huge part of the problem with their signaling mechanism.  It's trivially easy to lie and trick competing miners into mining invalid blocks that you and the majority of the network won't accept.
F2Pool claims to have done this when signaling support for Bitcoin Classic after they agreed to only run Core a while back.  It's pretty foolish to run code that may generate invalid blocks, with a team of lightweights, just to make a political point.  So it's pretty likely they aren't actually running BU.  With the exception of the Bitcoin.com pool, where Roger has plenty of resources to burn bribing hashpower to come to his pool, and he has completely incompetent boobs like running the show, upgrading a production network without bothering to test it.

Throw a few bones where it matters, and especially where it's costless (that's why politicians of both parties LOVE that abortion is a hot button issue).

True, federated may work out OK.


If you are increasing hashpower beyond the natural state of mining, that's going to be unprofitable.  Esp. if there is a tank in price due to a miner attacking in this way to cause problems - more miners drop out, and the attackers share increases as mining moves to mining on a loss.

Correct.  Might not be in a warehouse, might be botnets, might just be regular users.
The incentive structure of Bitcoin is such that it is more profitable to mine on the chain than attack.  So greed would go a long way, just like it did from the beginning.

Yep, if they lose every orphan race, along with Ver's bribes, that pool gets quite expensive, and no one has to attack anything.
Of course, once those blocks are losing orphan races, there's even an extra incentive for other miners to try to put a block to race against them for extra profit.
Miner signalling is about safety for non-validating nodes, but if it becomes a political mechanism, then miners can quickly put an end to it, all while ensuring security for the non-validating miners.

Cat herding an open source project is basically the dirty work of a project.  
Gavin was chosen because in the early days of the project, there really weren't a lot of people doing or willing to do that work.  Gavin was given some extra access that allowed him to do it so it freed Satoshi up to do other things.  That happened well before Satoshi disappeared.
I think some other people also had commit access at that time besides Satoshi and Gavin.  Gavin just took it upon himself to do a lot of the cat herding.
Satoshi disappeared without any warning or fanfare.  He may not have even had a choice in the matter.  We have no idea.  But there certainly was not any kind of "turn things over to Gavin".  That's invented history that Gavin made up.

I'm not your monkey.  Investigate for yourself and come to your own conclusion.  Or don't.
@_date: 2016-12-03 04:22:08
Yes, why?
@_date: 2016-11-04 17:21:56
You realize the only reason they are configured that way is because of the legality of it, right?
Pot is grown in large warehouses like this today in Colorado, but not in other places where it's illegal.  People adapt to conditions.  Unless you ban electricity or the internet, you will not ban miners.

You don't need Bitcoin to hire poor kids.

Need to actually explain this.  It does not follow.


Baseless assumption


Baseless assumption (and irrelevant)

Another baseless assumption.
Lots of really poor logical arguments on things are causing really bad conclusions.

They pretty much got rid of shadowbans except for spammers.  They  have temporary suspensions visible only to the user tho.

Bitcoin Unlimited is not supposed to be run by miners, it's only supposed to be for users.
@_date: 2016-11-22 02:21:27
Often times incentives can force rational actors to act in detrimental ways long term, and even short term.  Relying  on miners to act in concert in benevolent ways is not a way to succeed.
@_date: 2016-12-04 13:41:38
If it ever comes down to ViaBTC being the lone holdout, they'll just get their blocks orphaned.
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:17:43
Because reddit will only make permanent suspensions visible, and he no longer is suspended.
Hint: I've been temporarily suspended by reddit admins before due his staff making up lies.  It was not visible to anyone.
@_date: 2016-12-04 15:35:11
There's really no way to know for sure if it's an attack or not.  Hell, just a few random orphanings might be enough to hurt their profits.
The signaling is for users to synchronize behavior, not a vote in the hands of miners who know best for us.  Miners seeing that there is more value for them with an expanded Bitcoin are perfectly within their rights to send a message to anyone who might seek to buy hashpower just to disrupt Bitcoin in the future.

Users who accept their blocks hire them, and buy the coins off of their chains.


An economic node is a node that defines what has value.
@_date: 2016-11-20 00:56:57
They believe the only true Bitcoin is the original one, and any coins with SegWit outputs will be vulnerable to theft if miners ever revert back to The One True Version, IIRC.

Cash refers to the bearer bond nature of Bitcoin.  In fact, Bitcoin's creator in fact refers to the similarities between Bitcoin and gold quite often when explaining why it would have monetary value.
Cash settlement means that it would be final, and no further objections could occur.  Nothing to do with cheap or fast.  When I pay cash for something, I can no longer do a chargeback.
The Wiki was created by Mike Hearn, someone who vastly misunderstands the nature of Bitcoin and it's usefulness (see the Hearnia obituary article he wrote, and the results of Bitcoin since then, where every prediction he made has been proven wrong).


Nope.  I've been around longer than so-called experts like Roger Ver.  Keep making assumptions.

He is permabanned.
@_date: 2016-11-25 01:54:44
Ironically, something like that would need SegWit to do the payment channels.

It is.  You control a contract that you can publish at any time that will give you your full balance back.  If someone else publishes a previous version of the contract, you or anyone else may confiscate ALL of the funds of your adversary.

The transactions are only seen by the nodes along the way (and depending on how routing is set up, the nodes may not even know the destinations).

Blockchain.info is consistently one of the shittiest wallets out there.
@_date: 2016-12-06 18:53:04
The marginal price to get into a block might easily drop by 90% as well, even if people don't fill up the space, which makes the price just as expensive.  And unlike a spam attack, where people are just temporarily delayed, the damage here is permanent to the blockchain filled with tons of spam.

You can send a transaction with ridiculous fees at any time.  I sent at the lowest priority level through core, because I didn't have any urgency to have it get paid (sending a friend back some money he sent to me to test Bitcoin), and was tempted to even go lower than the lowest, but 4 cents, who gives a fuck about that?

BU doesn't have a dynamic block size system.  It has a free-for-all orphan everyone system. 
Why would you think SegWit with a Hard Fork would get any traction at all?  I would oppose it strongly.
@_date: 2016-12-07 15:39:15
Great, so you do know.  So when I say two situations are similar, there's a word for that (hint: it's not strawman).
@_date: 2016-11-02 15:02:51
No, they aren't.  They are hired labor of the network.
@_date: 2016-11-01 20:26:53
Bitcoin Unlimited is more of a Trump-like molitov cocktail thrown at Core than anything serious.
I'm not even sure it's own creators think it is anything serious, and the fact that they got a few people to actually consider it something serious is the best part of the joke.

Ive seen this reported quite often.  And not all crosswalks are this way (especially on non busy streets with fewer pedestrians), but office thermostats are usually duds.  They exist because it pacifies people thinking they have control in a situation where they don't, which is identical to why Unlimited put in the parameters.

@_date: 2016-11-25 17:07:19
The context of the quote basically is the opposite of the spirit of what he is quoting.  This is dishonesty (and par for the course for Bitcoin Trump).
@_date: 2016-11-06 18:46:04
The difference is there was no solution in place, nor one that could have been safely  in place faster than SegWit.
@_date: 2016-11-26 01:08:32
You just stick to baseless Blockstream conspiracies that have 1/1000th the evidence.
@_date: 2016-11-12 02:12:21
Yep, also, most  people don't want to waste time in a cesspool.
@_date: 2016-11-02 00:23:58
The result is that the controls serve no purpose other than to head-fake users into thinking they have more control than they do.
Where do you disagree?
@_date: 2016-11-18 22:36:38
Contrary to what no-nothings like Gavin say, it actually takes time to roll out significant upgrades in businesses.
If I were betting, I'd bet it will take 6 months.  My best guess is we get to around 80-85% by Jan 1, and Roger continues his tantrum.  Eventually miners get fed up and start orphaning those blocks, and we get SegWit.
@_date: 2016-11-25 17:56:42
Even the bots?
@_date: 2016-11-17 18:55:24
You can also choose to mine on top of equally heighted blocks where one supports SegWit and one does not at virtually no risk.
@_date: 2016-11-16 03:05:37
My count would be a lot higher if didn't decide to reverse Roger's whitelist addition of me.  I'm now effectively limited in participation, because of the egregious crime of calling someone a "whiny bitch".  Something that happens much worse on a regular basis there.
Fact of the matter is, is far more censored than here.
@_date: 2016-11-04 16:01:51
Are they really open to it? Or were they being nice?
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:13:17
No, I knew exactly what I was talking about, he was permabanned, and they reversed it.
@_date: 2016-11-25 17:58:49
But they can try to get you quit working on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-23 21:46:40
I doubt miners are mining at a loss.  However, miners who are locked into fixed contracts for electricity or otherwise have high fixed to variable costs may be mining with rigs that never return a profit.

@_date: 2016-11-02 01:28:32


Wut, that doesn't mean anything.  What is a "current blockchain"?


So why does BU, champions of Nakamoto Consensus, refuse to implement this?
@_date: 2016-11-02 17:37:20
Yes, it is, for that chain.  It just has a different genesis block than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-27 18:57:12
Jtoomim's complaints were mostly correct- the 3.7MB blocks are mostly just for show.
@_date: 2016-11-08 13:23:52

Make a re-genesis block, reset difficulty to 1, and have fun.
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:30:14
BTCC just had one of their servers that didn't upgrade.
Upgrading can take time.  I don't think anyone expected it to be ready in the first period.  There's a reason why these things are cautiously deployed instead of thrown to the wind like ETH.

WTF is a proxy coin?
@_date: 2016-11-04 15:28:32


Which is my point - what makes you confident they'll go to a far more complex and unproven technology when they haven't even taken a really simple step.


Or maybe this gets them to build something useless, waste effort, give up, and go back to pencil and paper.
@_date: 2016-11-28 02:42:09
So you are saying SegWit is no worse than what we have today in terms of worst case scenario?  While 2MB would allow for a much greater attack?
@_date: 2016-12-21 20:44:13
Congrats Alex!
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:55:30
There is no urgency to signal right away.  People should take their time and upgrade as they can, not rush things out.  This isn't Ethereum.
@_date: 2016-11-22 13:26:11
Not everyone is the enemy.  But we shouldn't mistakenly think just because a business model relies on exploiting the Bitcoin blockchain doesn't mean they are allies or have common interests.

@_date: 2016-11-21 22:23:45
Perhaps. But I doubt it, the scaling urgency is vastly overblown.

If that was the case, expect orphans.
@_date: 2016-11-27 23:23:30
It's more about removing users as being able to validate the miners.  From there, you hand the network over to miners, where the network is trivially easy to control/censor/inflate.

@_date: 2016-11-20 00:58:45
Keep in mind, people like Roger Ver and Jeff Garzik talk about these companies that are waiting for the opportunity to "use bitcoin" aka bloat the chain with non-monetary spam, as ways of externalizing costs onto others.
I'd actually be more worried about spam today than then.  Especially since it's pretty easy for miners to SPV mine and just stop validating and not worry about orphan risk being in a large pool.
@_date: 2016-12-25 19:53:28
No, you cant have my Bitcoins.

Yes, they can block them.  Once miners are upgraded to 0.13.1 safely, and ViaBTC still has hashrate and wants to hold the entire ecosystem hostage, miners will have little tolerance for their antics.
@_date: 2016-12-07 02:25:10

You have to live through a few of these and not set yourself up for failure by having more money than you'll safely be able to ignore for 5 years.
Buying in at $800 a few years ago sucked too.
Buying in at $14 a few years before that also sucked too for a while.
What sucks even more is unloading those positions at a loss (or even a moderate gain).
If you are a trader trying to time short term movements, you are going to get REKT.  If you believe Bitcoin has a legitimate shot at massive potential, you need to set your time horizon realistically.

So if the price is close, and switches back and forth, people have to switch names?  This sounds retarded.
How are you judging market price?  If a hard fork reduced the unit by 1/10th, and the value of a single "coin" was higher, how do you account for it?  Or do you multiply by number of coins in circulation?  If so, what if a fork granted Satoshi 10 billion coins as a reward (with no way or not to prove they are unspendable)?
That is by far one of the dumber metrics I've ever seen to decide a name.

Cash may or may not require a hefty transaction fee.  It's not a transaction fee that makes something cash-like or not.  
Zero-confirm transactions are very much like checks.  They are promises to pay, but the funds may not be there by the time it's cashed.  But people still accept checks in many cases - if you know who the user is and have recourse if he stiffs you, or if the amount is low where it's not a huge deal if the payment is invalid, or if you can take back what you gave to them, such as digital content.

But it's a soft fork.  The reason why it's high is because when there have been lower thresholds in the past, you'd end up with temporary splits where users who didn't upgrade might follow the wrong chain.   It's a safety mechanism.


Except miners get revenue too.  So all someone needs to do to block any progress in the future is to profitably hold 5% of the hashpower.  As the price tanks, they simply can scale back as other miners become unprofitable.
Miners will act if holdouts start affecting value.

Yes, and that's why I expect miners to take advantage of their power by orphaning miners who try to be obstructionists.

I viewed Bitcoin as digital gold, as did Bitcoin's creator.  In fact, some of my earliest posts on Bitcointalk are about how Bitcoin is a poor alternative to existing payment solutions for most use cases.  My interest in Bitcoin came from serving the underserved, particularly after the government regulations cracked down on two perfectly reasonable uses of money - prediction markets and poker.  The banking system censored all transactions to the point where many providers had to shut down.  Bitcoin completely destroys this, as we are seeing today with the popularity of Bitcoin used to transfer money across borders and regardless of regulation.

Bitcoin should have a wide range of ways to get the blockchain to be decentralized.  The more ways, the better.


How?  Resilient to what?


I agree with the mining part, and we are pretty screwed there.  It may very well be because node costs are too high.


How?  The price when we had empty blocks was often free or maybe a penny.  Now people are paying 5-10x that.  You'd need to increase the block size 10-50x to make up for that, and doing that might even lower the price even more.

Yes.  That could easily be a single node pretending to be thousands.  And even so, miners will do what is in their interests in BU, as BU completely removes all choice from users, but replaces it with the illusion of a choice.
But you are missing the point.  If 95% of nodes went to BU and signaled they only wanted 1MB blocks, miners would be able to, against their wishes, serve them big blocks that they would accept.

Some miners are pure profit plays, but some people who wish to acquire Bitcoin see mining as advantageous.  If you want to buy $100MM worth of Bitcoin, good luck doing that on the market without moving the price.  Your only opportunity is to mine.

You don't "sell for electricity costs" in this scenario.  You have cash (or cashflow) that you use to pay electricity in order to acquire coins.
Now sure, you would need to add hardware to keep at that rate, but you also would have more value in coins by that point in USD as well in most scenarios (hashpower cannot continue to keep rising unless efficiency rises or price goes up).

Are you advocating for a 5% increase in block size?  Why would the fees be the same?  When you produce more of something, the price drops.


Raising it has basically made mining fees their entire profit margin.

So why would BU make a client that intentionally does not follow "Nakamoto Consensus"?
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:16:37
While this is mostly true, there are some other affects at play.
When someone chooses to acquire Bitcoin with fiat, they have two options - mine for them, or buy them.  While most people are not suited for mining, it's certainly a significant amount of demand for some.  If you have massive sources of power, warehouses to house them or can acquire them, then mining *can* be a more effective way to get lots of Bitcoin than just buying it.
When the economics of mining changes from being better to worse, the money that would go into mining now goes into buying, meaning that those who would have mined to acquire now add to buy pressure.
It's never quite this simple as mining has a lot of sunk costs and delays - if you want to mine, you'll place orders well in advance, set up factories, etc...  So when conditions change from favorable to unfavorable, much of that money is already spent.  But new entrants now are choosing to *not* start that process, and instead can just acquire by directly buying.  So you see what looks like a price floor.  At the most extreme cases, mining goes not just below profitability, but below production costs.  At this point, you are better off turning off your miners, and in the most extreme cases, you default on any leases or loans you have for your facilities.  At that point, you see a bit of a supply slowdown (which does readjust, but the difference between a 10%/2 week mining vs. flat mining mean 725,000 coins mined in a year vs. 650,000 coins. 75,000 coins is $450MM in a year at $6k prices.  You have $450MM in less supply, and that's a pretty significant pressure pushing the price to at least some form of stability, if not a rise in value.
Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment as well as the onboarding nature means it's not quite as simple.  It's only recently getting below typical inflation targets, meaning there was significant stock being added as a percentage of total amount held.
What also is interesting is the massive amounts of hashpower that has come online.  This means there are enormous real costs going on.  At peak efficiency and power rates, you are looking at nearly $2MM per day on electricity costs.   That's significant downward pressure (either reduced demand because someone prepaid, or sell presure to cover costs).  That doesn't cover staffing or building costs of a data center.
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:14:46
Wrong.  On average it's been something like 9.5 minutes because of hashpower increasing.  This means that the adjustment is always adjusting based on past conditions, not current.
@_date: 2016-11-25 03:28:32

Yeah, Gavin had worn out his welcome long ago.  That part's well known.  His anti-collaborative behavior and divisiveness goes way back, to when he tried to kick one of the top developers, from the project after Gavin single-handedly rejected a superior version of P2SH.  Gavin has been toxic for quite a while, but fortunately stopped participating as well.


He whines that Bitcoin moves too slow and is the only open source model that doesn't follow it.  It's in one of the videos with him and Gavin.


No, because unupgraded users don't use SegWit, so it doesn't matter.  You still are able to validate everything else.


I'll be happy to.  BU allows miners to create blocks that you cannot even validate the inflation rate or that miners haven't even just stolen from holders.  If they create blocks that users cannot validate reasonably, users will just stop validating.


This has nothing to do with a potential fork of the chain where the block limit is removed from user software with BU (which it does, through it's fake limits, that are overridden if miners ask three times in a row, aka Mustafa from Austin Powers).  Try validating a 100MB block or 1GB block.  Why do you think Jihan is building that massive data center?  The Chinese Mining Cartel is selling you all a trojan horse so they can own Bitcoin.

It's been a while since I followed this, but I remember a few mechanisms where the you do something like that to initially color coins (e.g. 1 output that is a magic tag, then the other output is the coins that are colored).  Then any time that UTXO is spent, there's a protocol for how those are transferred.  For example, if you spend that UTXO, the first two outputs that add up to the amount of the UTXO are a transfer, and the rest is just treated as Bitcoins (to allow paying for fees).  Thus, if all members of your route hold the same colored coins, you can have a series of transactions that are updated in the same way as if it were Bitcoins.

Some people have locked in contracts with guaranteed minimums from electric companies.

Mining has moved a lot from China at that point.  Yes, a lot of hashpower is at optimal rates, but it's not always that simple.
Mining pools doesn't mean that's where the hashpower is located.


If you prepaid for electricity, you are going to mine no matter what (unless bankruptcy and liquidation is better).  If you have non-BTC currency and the option to turn off mining when its unprofitable (and stop paying electricity costs), you are foolish to continue to mine less Bitcoin than you could get by just buying.
Mining is paying an up front cost to get the option to buy Bitcoins at a discount in the future.  The trick is you don't know how much you'll be able to buy for a fixed amount (electricity).

The difference is miners can choose to orphan blocks that others choose.
Miners may have implemented many soft forks you have no clue they did.
Other users may have UASF'd and miners may be agreeing with them, and if you are running "old" software, you'll have no idea. That's the whole benefit of soft forks is old nodes don't know. That's also the drawback, it's harder to reject them.

Downvoters don't even care, they are part of this mindless pitchfork mob who think anything not jumping up and down in favor of XT deserves to be downvoted.  Don't really give a shit.
Certainly, there is a huge amount of pressure in being the first to mine a big block.  You put up a lot of risk.  You need to be very confident that far greater than 50% will follow you for a long time.  If not, you get orphaned.  Mining the small chain is 0 risk, since the big chain will honor you until someone else breaks the chain.
Let's say one pool votes for it and has 30%.  75% passes, that 30% stays on the short chain, the other 45% mining the big chain will get orphaned and lose everything.  As a miner, I wouldn't touch the big chain unless I thought 95% of the other miners were on board or someone else mined first.

The current rules, which have been the rules for years, absolutely is the default position.
Bitcoin is quite centralized right now, and we are seeing miners that don't fully validate, the vast majority of users relying on SPV or worse level of security.  There's no fee market, and the only reason why we have any security is due to a very large inflation rate.
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:36:25

Whether or not you run XT or not has zero effect until miners switch, or XT decides to come up with a new POW scheme that is incompatible with existing blocks.

Wallets will either support using the old rules or the forked rules.  Once a block exists that meets one rule but not the other, it's possible to send a transaction in one that does not confirm in the other.  This means your coins get split.
Your wallet will only follow one chain, unless the wallet is modified to check both chains.

Well, XT can only exist separately (until Hearn gets impatient again and puts a checkpoint in) when a chain with more work exists.  That may exist for some period of time when 50%+1 of the mined blocks are coming from XT-compatible nodes.
Of course, if the plan goes to shit and miners decide to go back to Bitcoin, XT-only blocks gets orphaned and users of XT lose their money.  Bitcoin is not affected in such case.

Miners only vote, votes are not any kind of binding agreement, as we witnessed with the last soft fork.  The only thing that matters is a vote happens (with honest or dishonest miners), and 50%+1 actually mine that chain over the long run.
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:54:48


Miners only incentive is to mine the chain that gives them the most profit.  If XT is worth $X and BTC is worth $Y, the higher ratio of price to difficulty gets mined, and if it's even remotely close that BTC has a chance of winning, miners are much safer staying with Bitcoin than being stuck on a fork that will get orphaned.
@_date: 2015-08-01 00:16:45

75% voting does not mean 75% will even mine one block on that chain, let alone, continuously mine on that chain.

So when you have coins on one fork but not another (as the forks diverge and diverge) - each with only a fraction of the hashpower, you end up with coins on one fork but not another.  You send coins to someone who claims they never got them.  They have to then go into the other fork to recover coins, or they are lost forever.  It's a fucking mess.
How does a miner pick the one that follows the longest chain?  The only way to even know this is to run all implementations!
But it does seem simple to you.  In reality, it's a fucking disaster.

Yes, you can switch algorithms, and that is what I'm talking about - a case where miners misbehave or abandon the Bitcoin network, leaving it susceptible to attack.  It would only be in a case where it is already insecure due to a possible 51% attack from hostile miners.


You are confusing the fact that today's miners do not equate to every possible miner in the future.
Miners can all decide to give themselves 50 Bitcoins per block tomorrow, and I will ignore them.  Some miners will realize mining 25 Bitcoins on a valid chain is better than 50 on a worthless chain.

The issue is when a large number of nodes follow this model, or only a very small number have the full chain, or are too busy serving it to serve you.
As for "faking 10k"- you don't need to do this.  You have no idea that 100k exists or not, you can be misled into thinking the chain is only 90,001 blocks.
But you are convinced you are right and won't even look at the attack, so good luck with that.

Let's say there's another analogy, I am a woodworker in my spare time and take wood and build furniture with it. That furniture is worth more than the wood when I finish it. Does the IRS force me to claim my unsold inventory as income at that time? Of course not. It's not income yet. When I sell it, I either pay income taxes on the full value as a hobbyist (and can't deduct materials, electricity, etc...), or I keep track of my expenses if I expected to make a profit, and deduct losses when I sell it (losses carry forward to some extent in a business setting if you made no profit).
I'd say those arguments are quite strong for BTC mining - I have unsold inventory that I have claimed zero profit on until the time I sell it.

Yep.  And XT is doomed if it ever becomes less valuable than BTC due to this, no matter what miners previously voted on.


And all things aren't equal.  If I cannot validate my chain, it's useless to me.


Only for some people.  People bitch about fees as cheap as they are now, and once you eliminate scarcity of block space and the subsidy decreases, you are in a tough spot.  Do you just accept an insecure network?  Somehow try to force fees to go up through fixed fees that are centrally managed?  Or just have an eternal 1-2% subsidy.  Some people are *already* proposing this.  Once Bitcoin becomes subject to the whims of the majority, this is inevitable to eventually happen.


What if it wasn't weaker or are you only defining weaker to mean whatever chain has the most hashing power?  A chain that ends in centralization and censorship that gets outcompeted by centralized solutions anyways is much weaker in my opinion.

The most important thing in an economy is consistency.  Bad rules that are constant are better than better rules that are constantly changing.
@_date: 2015-08-31 02:53:26
There could be advantages in limiting other miners.
For example, OPEC functions (or used to) as a cartel, getting higher prices by forcing members to limit production.  This results in greater profits.
Miners ideally (in their interests) would co-ordinate to keep block sizes small enough to maximize revenue by having fees increase with a limited space.  Anyone who does not follow gets orphaned.

This has nothing to do with Ethereum, as the same system on RSK has the same flaws (except you have BTC backing it, which is a bit better than a shitcoin like ETH).


It liquidates 100% if you can't maintain the collateral compared to what the oracle claims the price is. 


It only makes sense to lock up your ETH to get "DAI" if you want to keep your ETH position while still having cash to spend on other things, which basically means you are buying more ETH with that DAI (which you can lock up, get more DAI, and then buy more ETH!).  It's by far the primary use case of it.


ETHtards wish to simply change the old financial system to instead enrich themselves instead. Build the same broken financial systems (instead of issuing loans based on overvalued shit-real estate, issue them to a shitcoin instead), but with them in the middle. DeFi (really CeFi) is simply someone else who wants to be the new middleman, and the new money printer.  Bitcoin is unique in actually breaking that financial system, with a money that can't be printed out of thin air, that isn't subject to a central foundation controlling its rules.
The market is speaking very clearly on this, as well. Just 2 years ago, people were talking about a Flippening, meanwhile, ETH can barely keep 10% of Bitcoin's value (and now only because they discovered that ponzi-like schemes for DAI incentivize leveraged buying and locked up supply to try to boost the price, much like demand for buying ETH to get ICOs locked up the price until it crashed down).

It's certainly not safe.
Risk profiles vary on a lot of things.  If you trust your sender, it's incredibly safe, but that takes away a big part of why you use Bitcoin.  If you don't trust your sender, it's dependent greatly on various conditions out there, and what your mitigation is. Of course, a lot of people have their head in the sand thinking it actually is safe today if it weren't for those darn miners "cheating" a rule that isn't a protocol rule.

This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of money.  Money is most valuable when it is universally accepted.  This is partially why the USD has so much value - it's the world's reserve currency.
Splitting the money fragments it.  This is different than splitting the protocol - you could have the same money with different protocols in a sidechain system.
The best system is to have a variety of security models and features with a unified currency that can move between the models.  Everyone can get what they want very easily in these cases.

The argument is against block sizes that automatically double every 2 years.  You are straw-manning the argument against it.
Raising the block size does not scale Bitcoin to any significant level.  It just doesn't work, and is kicking the can down the road.
The 1MB limit was way too big initially and probably should have been a lot smaller so the pain would have been more well defined earlier.


Where is there any real analysis on this other than hope?


And it very well could end up with miners using 8MB blocks as an advantage against smaller miners filled with spam.

It's a good idea in theory but bad in practice.
If I am a miner, I need to run all implementations because I don't want my block to get orphaned by other miners.  Any time I would make an invalid block on any of the implementations- I am at risk of being orphaned.  The only safe thing to do is run them all.
As someone accepting Bitcoins, I need to run all implementations to ensure that my coins are actually something others would accept and to make sure I'm not on some fork.
This just doesn't work well in practice and really doesn't give much benefit.  For example, let's say there was a consensus bug in Bitcoin that said any transaction that sends exactly 83 coins to an address is invalid.  It's a peculiar bug, but really not a huge impact.  If this happened, people could just change it to a slightly different amount and be fine.  Having another implementation that does accept that transaction would result in a fork, and you end up getting orphaned or on a long-running fork.  It's actually better to just be compatible with the bug.

Long run, it isn't used?  Wait until there's a fee market.  Then it will be used.


What is unusual now is going to be typical in the future.


Receiver pays a fee manually?  You talking CPFP?  What makes you think a receiver is interested in making sure it goes through by paying extra?


Yeah, it's a big fee increase.  1% amount again is just pulled out of your ass.


That ship has sailed.  Miners have realized they can make more by taking higher fees rather than an arbitrary "first seen" output.  It's like wishing you could believe in Santa Claus after you realize it's a lie.


A wallet that has higher fees being invisible?  No thanks. Wallets that must keep small unspent transactions around just to use for fees?  No thanks.

Here's one example: 
I'm pretty sure there have been larger attacks.
Anyway, Bitcoin needs to be anti-fragile - not dependent on trust or goodwill, but working in spite of it.  If you trust the sender, accepting 0-conf is safe.  If the sender is some unknown person you have no recourse against, then don't risk it.
RBF won't hurt you if you trust your sender since they are honest, so what's the harm?
@_date: 2015-07-26 02:05:04
1)  Not sure what you are proposing here.  I lock up funds with a hub, with a refund.  I authorize the hub to pass funds on to other hubs/end nodes periodically.  They now have access.  There's nothing that can be double-spent since everything requires 2 keys.
2)  You can't use the same coins since the coins require 2 signatures - you and the hub.
3)  Not sure on this one.
4)  Has nothing to do with these concerns.  The concern is I cannot trust the hub to disappear/hold my funds hostage.  To prevent this, I ask for them to sign a refund for all my funds, but not redeemable for some time.  The issue is, they can sign it, but my transaction that funds it gets changed, so my refund is not valid.  The hub cannot steal my funds, but they can leave them where no one can touch them without cooperation.  They could have evil intent, and perhaps say "I'll give you half or nothing, if you cooperate", and you'd be better off just losing half your money than all.  The refund transaction prevents this.

I don't think that's true it needs to hit the chain. What needs to happen is secure, trustless solutions denominated in Bitcoin.  That is inclusive of but not the same as on-chain settlement.


Arbitrary doesn't mean much.  It likely was too high, judging by mining centralization today.  But, we have it.


This actually concerns me.  We *need* fees to secure the network, as the block reward will run out.  Now, we may end up with a much more secure network with more tx and smallish fees or with a smaller block with higher fees, but either way, there needs to be fees for this to work.


I agree, but volume doesn't give value.  The solution might be to have a reasonable max, and then put a soft-fork policy in place for miners to set block size max at a place that maximizes mining revenue, where they coordinate.
The economics and technological impact are just really great and hard to predict, so that's why I am going to favor small changes with limited side effects to sweeping changes without safety switches.

You don't know what the miners are actually doing.  There's no way to know for certain what transactions they have or have not seen.  It's not deterministic.  You can guess and have evidence, but it's impossible to know.


Good, this can be a step in the right direction.  But it's only a matter of time before miners figure out they can make more money with RBF, and users get sick of the FSS RBF limitations.


You clearly don't understand motivation for doing this.  It's not to fuck with bagholders.  It's to build a secure Bitcoin ecosystem without relying on centralization.
Anyway, 0-conf can be relatively safe with notary multi-sig like GreenAddress.  So people who rely on bad security will get burned is not my problem.  There are answers.  They are too lazy or cheap to implement them.

That doesn't mean that the reward to miners is guaranteed to stay the same.


Very simplistic argument.  This didn't happen the last halving.  Why?


The fee won't go higher than the cost of alternatives.  Armchair economics doesn't get us any closer to what the market will decide (and I know you hate markets).


Yeah if we have your ridiculous guesses of $100 tx fee.


Not sure why you are assuming locking your salary into this or the fees.  But hey, let's make up numbers!


Instant transactions is one.  Being able to increment in small charges without trust and having to create an account for every service you need is another.  I'd be a LOT better off if I was playing on a dice site without having to deposit to them, and could just use LN to settle balances periodically.

What world are you accepting $5000 of payment and giving up services right away and needing the money fast, but not being able to wait for a confirm?  This is a really weird choice.


Again you are confused.  Full RBF has nothing to do with scorched earth unless combined with CPFP.


Ah, you are one of those people that use the word game theory without understanding what it means (much like your understanding of RBF).


Sure.  But it shouldn't be invisible.  And it being *possible* requires having extra unspent transactions laying around, forcing you to tie them together and reduce privacy.

You don't know if it makes sense or not.  There are a lot of variables here.  As long as most people are doing what they are supposed to be doing, it's very low risk.

@_date: 2015-07-02 15:18:25


I CPU mined 4+ years ago, but no mining since then.
Centralization of mining may be normal, but it opens up multiple attack vectors to Bitcoin and should be avoided.  Typically centralization comes from economies of scale and specialization advantages.  Which is why we must be careful in introducing changes that affect these variables.


And there is no fee pressure or fee market now.  So of course fees make up nothing.  And continuing to expand the block size just ensures fees continue to be miniscule, and miner benefits and security is affected.  Keep the block size too small and there isn't enough, make it too large, and the fees are too small to make income.


But miners already have a mechanism for it.  They can orphan big blocks if they so choose.  Nothing can stop them.  Saying you don't want it is like saying you don't like gravity.


Miners are not the ones I want to trust here.  They have different incentives.


There's not really such a thing as an all math version.  And picturing what might exist in 20 years is again just wild speculation.  Science fiction has shown time and time again people often overestimate the future or just plain get tons of things wrong.  You are purely speculating and extrapolating old patterns that must, at some point, come to an end.  If it does come true, you won't get any objections about manually changing this again.  If it's so obvious, who objects?

There are people and organizations I would trust to not dilute my holdings more than a government.  That's a great feature, whether or not you would use it.  There are more safeguards that could be put in check with multi-sig and auditing.


This is just flat out wrong.  Multi-sig with federated servers constantly auditing each other is a protection.  Less safe than full block validation, but even Bitcoin isn't full-proof, as people like two-bit-idiot could get enough people on board with InflationCoin that they hard fork the 21m coin limit and have eternal inflation.

I'm not suggesting stopping it.  Miners have incentives to not do it when possible and reasonable.  However, the incentives line up for miners to do it for longer as blocks become harder to validate and how it matters.  Mining on headers makes sense until you can validate the block, and then you can get tx fees, which of course will matter more.  Once block rewards drop, mining on headers will be pointless.

Proof of burn is useful for establishing reputation.

If my reputation is ever negative, I can create a new account on a whim.  However, if I have burned some coin, I can prove that I have something to lose if this account gets negative reputation.

That's one solution.  There are more.  But yeah, centralized solutions where no one can actually do harm is far better than blind faith in miners.

No, it doesn't. It operates entirely by trusting oracles hand selected by the MKR team (and controlled by the token owners, of which can switch it). It has an "emergency switch" that can shut it down if the MKR team deems it worthy of shutting down.


- Anyone with enough MKR tokens can switch out the oracles, give a false price, and liquidate everyone.
- During a price crash, the contract cannot liquidate fast enough. This breaks the peg.

Running a miner only makes sense if its an attempt at profit, no one is an enthusiast for high electricity bills and noise and heat.
If you really want to worry about it, you could also just consider paying taxes when selling the coin with a 0 cost basis, and nothing until then. Not a tax attorney but I've heard of some people doing that. You may pay a bit more taxes in that side, but if you believe Bitcoin will be worth a lot more or next to nothing when you sell, then it might only be a small factor.

I'm trying to figure out the exact attack here and find that link, I know I saw it, but the idea was a slowly propagating block could actually be advantageous for you, which was really similar to a block discarding attack.  I believe the issue was you hold back blocks until you see others have sent one, then you quickly send yours through the network.  It's similar in this case, in that you just send your slow big block early, which takes forever to get through to some % of the network, but gets to another set fast (say you are in China, and can connect to each other fast, but not outside).  In this case, the Chinese miners see your blocks first, start mining on them, and in the mean time, other blocks may hit.  It's basically the selfish mining attack, but utilizing others.  I wish I could find that exact white paper.
The point is, there's a lot of complexity here, and simply, there will be a lot of unintended consequences by tweaking things.  I'd be very open to a minor tweaking, say changing to 2MB initially, and re-evaluating.  If nothing happens bad, then there will be far less objections about doing it as technology advances.  If bad stuff happens, we limit the damage.  You don't push a car down a hill without having brakes on it.  There needs to be a mechanism to keep it from going out of control.
If Bitcoin needs to raise an 8GB cap, it will basically have failed in its mission.  Bye bye decentralization.  But, say you are right, and technology evolves, Bitcoin is refactored enough to handle problems it cannot solve now, then who is going to object to making it larger then?

Miners who pass up transactions with any fee less than their marginal cost to include it are at a disadvantage to miners who do include it.
This is like saying a gas station owner could just charge $50 for gasoline since he's free to set his own price.  Maybe some desperate sap comes along and can't make it to the next station and buys a few ounces, but it's not going to work for him.
You also have where different miners have different marginal costs.  It happens that large miners will generally have lower costs of including smaller fee transactions, thus giving them an even bigger advantage, increasing mining centralization.
Mining centralization is problematic because it leads to a system where it is easy to censor transactions, even to the point where miners could exclude smaller miners who avoid such censorship through a 51% attack.

Some miners do benefit from large blocks that take a long time to propagate or validate.


This check holds things in one direction. However, such efforts would require catel-behavior of punishing defectors who make bigger blocks.  Soft-forking is effectively what happens here, and sure, it's possible, and miners could do this.  However, there is no check in the opposite direction- if miners benefited for whatever reason from bigger locks, whether it was through attacking other miners leading to their higher orphan rate or maximizing income at the expense of decentralization.  There simply isn't a check without a hard limit or trusting the miners (or some type of algorithm for calculating a hard limit that is flexible).


I'm not sure why you think I haven't.  Let's not speculate on what actual sizes are, and instead consider worst case scenarios, which is mostly max size blocks immediately.  Yes, requiring exponential growth for a long period of time is incredibly foolish.  It's possible Moore's Law and other similar things continue.  It's also possible they don't, especially when it comes to laying physical infrastructure that is expensive.  This also assumes that doubling of resources is sufficient to keep up with doubling of block size, which isn't really possible given the way Bitcoin is designed, as it scales O(n^2).
Is it hard to imagine?  No.  A lot of things aren't hard to imagine.  I remember what people thought 2015 would be like in Back to the Future Part 2, but I'm still waiting for my flying car.

One reason is that you cannot really acquire a large amount of coins without driving the price up.  VCs are looking for making a large amount of money, and unless they are buying several million worth of coins, its not really worth it.

The effect is the same, but how often it occurs would differ.  Bigger blocks will take longer to propagate and validate, so miners would be mining on headers for much longer in this scenario.

There is no universal value of something.  There are only individual values.  And in this case, we have something - someone valued the pebble at $1000.  That's all it means.  It doesn't mean anyone else does.  If a stock goes from $100 to $80, nothing is destroyed, it just means different people's values of things changed.
Does a miner who spends $10,000 to dig out gold establish value?  Clearly he values the gold he might find &gt; $10,000, otherwise he wouldn't do it.

Remember, it's profit, not revenue that matters.  Mining 100 Bitcoins while spending 50 Bitcoins (and Bitcoin is worth $1000) is worth less than mining 50 Bitcoins and spending 49 Bitcoins (when Bitcoin is worth $20,000).

No, it depends on orphan rate and validation times.  There are plenty of cases where it makes sense to SPV mine.  No complex game theory, just basic calculations.


The seen vs. the unseen.  SPV mining successfully gains more than that vs. waiting for validation for some cases.  Sure, they lost out this time, but it still doesn't mean they should change their plan.

@_date: 2017-04-02 15:35:35
I'm proposing the exact same model that has always worked for Btcoin.


Chain splits have occurred before when miners failed to enforce soft forks.  What happens is miners lose money and then realize they have worthless coins, and return to the economic majority.
The entire basis of Bitcoin working is miners being incentivized to follow the rules enforced by users, not dictating what users need to follow.
If you believe miners, not users, rule Bitcoin, please jump ship to an altcoin.
Miners cannot stay profitable while refusing  to serve customers.  Try opening a restaurant that serves food that people don't want, and see how long you can stay in business.

This is why LN will not exist in the hub and spoke system you seem to keep assuming is guaranteed.
You have 1,000 people who each may want to spend $2000 more than what they have today, or get paid to a balance of up to $2000 more than they have today.  In this case, each user creates say 2 channels with other users each for $1000 in each direction.  This requires $200,000 deposited - the sum from each user.

There are attacks that exist that certain conditions and certain distributions of hashing power benefit from slowing down block propagation. This is easily done with 8MB blocks being filled.  Chines miners could very well use this to their advantage to screw up the non-Chinese miners, for example.


And I'm open to any proposal that doesn't leave the block size in the hands of miners or perpetually degrade Bitcoin.  Bitcoin scales poorly, and doubling block sizes would make 4x hardware requirements needed.


This is the problem.  Increasing the block size perpetually does not solve the problem.

They can do this, but it costs them money.  But it's their choice.

Their shitty bandwidth actually benefits them if they have the majority of the hashpower.
In this case - when China finds a block, it takes a long time for the rest of the world to find out about it.  During this time, Chinese miners can all start working on the next block, but other miners are still stuck working on an older block.  This gives the Chinese miner an advantage whenever they find a block.  Whenever the "rest of the world" miners find a block, the opposite happens - Chinese miners find out about it slowly, putting them at a disadvantage.  If China has the majority of hashpower (which seems to be the case now), then they will end up harming those outside the world more than they are harmed by others finding blocks that are slow for them to get.

No, I read it correctly.
Channels do not need to be open for any more time than a reasonable time to challenge an attempted publication of an earlier version of the transaction.  1-2 days seems plenty of time.
If someone wants to move $20M through LN, all they need to do is open enough channels through people who can as a sum move $20M to the right place.  Though, in that case, the recipient would either need to have a set of channels open that are capable of paying $20M, or the recipient can just open a channel directly with them for $20M.

A million people providing $2,000 worth of liquidity is a ton of liquidity.  They provide liquidity to each other through a P2P network.


Again, you treat an assumption as an axiom.  No, you do not need a hot wallet to participate.  For example, I could open a channel with someone where I must require manual intervention to sign such that I provide 100% of the liquidity.  My partner in the channel will have no issue with this, as they are risking nothing participating with me.  If I go offline or am slow to respond, then they lose nothing.

Again, you are taking a simplistic view.  Mining equipment is a sunk cost, with a marginal cost to operate.  It may be possible that mining equipment that will never pay for itself is still better to leave running.  As long as the marginal cost of operation is less than the reward, it will stay on.  So a 50% drop is extremely simple thinking.

Mining rigs go obsolete extremely quickly.  Mining farms need to constantly be reinvesting to stay relevant.
There's no reason why miners would be in any substantial position 10 years from now if Bitcoin takes off - mining always moves to the marginal value with some lag with the time it takes to catch up.  Even if those miners existed in 10 years, they wouldn't be in any great position.
If miners wanted to be Bitcoin speculators, they could just buy Bitcoins instead of mine them.  They are interested in profits, nothing else.

You can always select a fee way too high and get it accepted.  But that's a cost as well!  Much better to start low for not super urgent transactions and move up from there.  You are neglecting the cost of overpaying for tx fees most times so it's "good enough".  It would be far better for a user or wallet to start low and work it's way up, unless it's needed urgently.

This is where intuition fails.  It seems counter-intuitive that something where other people find out about my blocks slowly actually hurts others.  The amount of time to find a block is the same no matter what but propagation is slower.
Let's say there is a world where 60% of the miners are very well connected to each other (maybe they are the same pool, and pretending to be several pools), and 40% are not.  But the 60%'s blocks take 2 minutes to send to the 40%.
In this case, when the big pool finds a block, the 40% is still working on the previous block.  The small pool finds a block that is very small and fast to propagate, and send it to the 60% during this 2 minute period.  But the 60% ignores it, since it already has a block of the same height, instead building on the block it already found.  So the 40%'s block gets orphaned.  On average, the big pool will find the next block, and then the small pool keeps building a chain that it knows about, until the small pool finally finds out that the big pool is ahead.
Thus, the small pool, even with fast propagation, loses.


You are confusing specialization and investment with centralization.  Investment and growth actually will happen more when there are greater profits to be had - it diverts investment away from other areas where there are normal or less than normal profits into areas with high profits, until that is driven back down. 


That's the key, the incentives are not perfect, and actually incentivize centralization since it is advantageous for bigger miners to not publish as fast as possible.  If the incentives do not align with the desired outcome (censorship resistant mining), then the end result is not guaranteed, and in fact, is unlikely to occur.  We are seeing that today with validationless mining, pool centralization, geographical concentration, etc...

Default behavior is arbitrary, and we should expect miners to use the most profitable method of filling their blocks.  The fact that miners are dumb and hate money doesn't tell us much.


Because there's no way of knowing if a transaction has been RBFed.  It's a "be nice, please" flag more than meaning anything.


And that's where we differ.  I want Bitcoin to be anti-fragile.  To succeed in the face of untrusted adversaries, and not to rely on good neighbors.  We should be assuming everyone is out to get us, and STILL succeed.  Bitcoin is useless in a world where trust is sufficient.

Big miners actually benefit by slow propagation due to the same effects in selfish mining.  Thus, mining becomes even more centralized.


It depends a lot on miners ability and willingness to try to get edges.  As mining becomes less marginally profitable, miners will be more willing to seek additional edges.  With the upcoming halvening, I would expect these affects to be great.  Miners are already increasing small edges through things like RBF.

Think of miners as rolling a gigantic dice with 2^128 sides that takes a certain amount of energy to roll.  If the roll is less than a target value, you found a block!  If not, you roll again.  Once you found it, you send the proof that you rolled a great number (which can be easily verified) - which is the header along with the content of the block (which proves the header is for a valid block).
That's pretty much about it.

Great.  When you come up with a way to do this, pull requests are welcome.


Security is not any worse than before.  Unconfirmed transactions may never be confirmed by a miner and have no guarantee of ever being confirmed (same still applies before and after).  A block that is confirmed may be orphaned (due to a race, due to miners choosing to, etc...).  Nothing changes.


As a redditor for only 2 months, I wonder how you knew this.
SPV wallets provide zero security, they do not check the miners at all.  A full node checks the rules it cares about, thus, provides infinitely more security.  Miners cannot include an invalid transaction to you.

Who is overselling or hiding this?  All I see is it more accurately reflects the true costs of a mining node in terms of resources.


They don't delete it, they never ask for it.  They validate all they care about.  The fact some people use anyone can spend transactions in a new way has zero effect on them.  The only ones affected are mining nodes that need to validate more to make sure they don't get orphaned.


What is the attack vector that you think an unupgraded client is vulnerable to?  What attack vectors are SPV clients vulnerable to?


No, they blindly trust miners.  Miners can create billions of coins out of thin air, they can double-spend, they can sybil, etc...  None of those attacks are possible against unupgraded full nodes.

Because an SPV validates nothing at all.  I used your terminology as "partially validating".  Nodes validate the rules they care about.

Truth is no one really does, when we are predicting things like this. Even if you think it's likely Bitcoin goes near 0, but there's a chance it reaches a crazy amount, it's worth it to buy some. You need to be pretty certain against it to bet against it, or think it has no chance of going up much.
Economists are particularly blinded in the reasons for Bitcoin because if Keynesian thought that pollutes their minds, where savings is bad, and loans are good and somehow create wealth out of thin air. It's a prolonged set of brainwashing that make their positions so poor, and since they have no skin in the game (other than protecting themselves), they just jump through contortions that would make Cirque Du Soleil proud. Nothing is more contrary to what they have devoted their life to than Bitcoin, and having it succeed would mean they utterly failed, and when your entire livelihood is dependent on certain things being true, you'll believe them even under the most strong evidence against them and find ways to justify it even with the most insane arguments.
Some of this does apply to a lot of irrational Bitcoiners, who view success as inevitable, although at least they have skin in the game.

Did I claim it was permissionless? 
A federated sidechain is superior to a single custodian, which is the designed use case of Liquid (having funds you normally would have to custody at an exchange anyway).
Federated sidechains are not the answer to everything. It would have been nice if sidechains could have had a lot of the features people hoped, but like most new ideas, they need to be vetted and when flaws are found, you either address them or accept the limitations.
I'm sure people who got excited about cold fusion or perpetual motion might have seen a lot of promise then, but reality is a bitch, and unfortunately we live in a world with constraints.
Miners cannot steal funds in a federated sidechain, which is a big difference because miners are not identifiable and have no recourse. In a federated chain, the actors are known and could easily face recourse if they decided to steal funds, much like they do today when an exchange decides to just steal customer funds. Hacking a single exchange is possible today, and hacking a large number of them would be considerably harder.
Fortunately, the creators of the original mined sidechain idea realized these flaws and adjusted, rather than whining incessantly about someone finding a problem in them.

Ah, a Ramsey-ite debt-phobe.
Debt is a tool, and can be used foolishly or wisely.  People make foolish mistakes by committing to high interest rate debt that they cannot afford to pay off.
Smart debt can be an enormous tool to enable wealth.  Businesses do this all the time.  A mortgage on a house where money is incredibly cheap right now is an enormous wealth-building tool.
Worst case scenario, the guy has quite a good amount of savings with  this plan (I don't know the terms of the debt, but say it's 3 years).  That's $900/month, and he'd have an extra $2100 to sock away for bad times (only $900 less than before, and now he has $30k bitcoin as assets).
He has liquid assets - his Bitcoin.  But he also has next to no living expenses since he's living at his parents house.
If you don't recommend any kind of debt to invest in anything, you're basically ruling out almost every serious business with growth potential, and ruling out any kind of reasonable retirement plan as you'll just be socking money into cash in order to pay for everything with cash.
No debt is great advice for retards who can't figure out that 16.99% interest is worse than 2.9%.  But if your IQ is above 75 or you have any amount of self control, maybe reconsider.

fees and price go hand in hand, if an OTC has better access to Liquidity, you basically are paying a higher fee to get a better price. OTC's will have access to more exchanges than most people, so they can spread the demand around more. Or they have someone else who is wanting the other side of the deal, so they don't have to touch it.
So you may pay higher in the "fee" column with OTC, but you may actually end up with a better overall deal by not having slippage.

AsicBoost isn't evil.  Patent monopolies are evil.  Patents are  direct threat to decentralization in Bitcoin mining.  Covert AsicBoost could be done by miners who were willing to circumvent this monopoly (but they had to make up fake reasons for blocking SegWit, otherwise they would admit to violating a patent).  
AsicBoost is now part of the BDPL.  This means that it's open to all who choose to share their patents, thus preventing a patent monopoly from adding centralization pressure.
Furthermore, this form of AsicBoost does not have the negative impacts on protocol upgrades or on block size.  Covert AsicBoost resulted in incentives to create empty or tiny blocks, and interfered with a lot of useful tech that needed a merkle root in the coinbase, such as SegWit.
Version rolling has none of those negative side effects.  The only downside is that BIP8 supported 28 parallel soft forks in the past, and now that number has been decreased.  Even so, the chances we need 28 parallel soft forks at the same time is so negligible that it doesn't matter if we reduce it a little bit.
The last difference is this is now in the open, and everyone can see who is doing it, and who isn't.

See you are going to extremes, that I'm risking losing it all.  It's that kind of black and white thinking that really irritates me about Ramsey's cult.
I come from a poker background.  There were players that were reckless and took shots higher than they should have and even if they were winning players they would lose due to bad variance.  Or smart players that had adequate bankrolls that would require epic downswings to lose.  But that doesn't make all poker risky in the same sense.  The guys risking it all would get rekt by an eventual downswing, and maybe a few come out filthy rich.  The guy taking reasonable shots (where there still is risk) would have more chances of success.  But it doesn't mean they are both taking on equal risk.
Every situation is different.  You have to look at the odds of certain bad things happening, and if they are correlated.  So he could lose his job.  Whether or not he takes the loan doesn't make much of a difference in this risk - he's still living with his parents, except now he has a shorter time frame to find a new job.  And very worst case scenario, he has to liquidate some coins and loses some money.  Not the end of the world for him.  If he was in his parents basement building a business without any income - that would also be a risk.  But how risky is it for him?  He could fail at it, and would have less money than if he took a steady job.  It's the same idea.  He's very fortunate, his monthly nut would still only be &lt;$1000 even if his bitcoin loan completely fucked him, which is far less than someone who has a year-long lease and loses their job.  So buying bitcoin in this case is less risky than him moving out of his parents house, and surely that wouldn't be super risky.

@_date: 2018-02-26 19:56:39
Depends on my situation.  If I had $3k/month of disposable income, and a pretty low interest rate (4.9%) here, I can repay the whole thing within a year. Risk is I lose my job and don't have that spare income, and I could have used that money to buy savings.
Let me throw out another hypothetical.  You own real estate.  It appreciates.  You decide to sell that real estate and buy another piece of real estate at equal price to what you are selling, and you own 80% of it.  You have two options: 
1) take out a loan for 80% market value of the house and put down 20%, and take the rest of the cash and invest it.  You can comfortably afford the loan payment on the house over the term, and the interest rate is relatively low (&lt;5%).
2) put your entire equity toward a down payment, have a smaller down payment, and don't have any money to invest.
Would you say in comparing situations that it would be unwise to do 1 instead of 2?  It's a bit more risky (then again, having a massive amount of your net worth tied into a single asset is also risky).
I would argue 1 is not substantially more risky than 2, as long as you can withstand a downturn where you lose your job and have enough savings to pay your mortgage until you find a new one.
But really, it's not much different.  He can safely repay the debt even if Bitcoin goes to shit in less than a year at a reasonable interest rate.
The only question here is if the risk is worth the 5% premium of having money now.  I would say 5% is pretty cheap here.
Hell, if he was buying a car and took out $30k in debt on it, it wouldn't even be that crazy, and buying Bitcoin is surely better than a depreciating asset like a car.

Invest in means of production, R&amp;D, etc...
Do you think no one consumes anything, or ever will?  If everyone hoards, and goods are being produced, I'm gonna buy the shit out of it and live like a king.  Eventually there gets to be a point where people say "fuck deferred consumption, this is great now".  Plus people already have a time preference for consuming in the present.
Hoarded cash isn't investment, correct.  It's simply a representation of a preference for deferred consumption.
Yes, if it all of a sudden went, prices go up, and then the preference for consumption goes down.  But if you see a bunch of people holding cash for future consumpion, and prices are low, you can make a killing preparing for it and investing (e.g. R&amp;D, expanding factories, etc...) so that you can produce a ton when the time comes to change.
You talk about the gold standard like it was a bad thing.  Yes, you had quick, painful, but fast recovering depressions.  Unlike the fiat era where recessions and depressions drug on and took longer to recover from.

Ok... What's your point?  Prices drop and people are incentivized to invest to support the future demand from savers, or people are incentivized to spend now instead of later.
Money is not productive at all, so if it is hoarded or spent doesn't matter.  The only thing that matters is the productive parts of the economy and weather they are being consumed or used as investments to be able to produce more goods later.  A society that is able to defer consumption is able to invest more into producing, thus is able to produce even more later.
Too much Keynsian brain poisoning has occurred to think that people become rich by consuming and destroying productive capital instead of saving and investment.

The reason for this is obvious - selling a token that people can gamble on thinking it might go up in value, even though there is no logical reason for this.

This is the use case that potentially is useful, as proof of existence is fairly boring and easy to pull off without any kind of sophisticated mechanism.
Now I have not done my homework on this side of Factom yet, mostly sticking to assuming that this system will work, and looking at economics of it.
Proof of non-existence seems as simple as providing all of the information available (regarding whatever subject you are limiting scope to), and proving it existed in a certain order.  Am I missing something groundbreaking going on?  And Factom does not actually store the documents (you'd rely on doing it yourself or put in Storj, etc...), but rather, just stores hashes for you, and proves that *you* (or whatever entity is represented by a key) has only stored those items.  So it would be your responsibility to figure out a way to deliver the actual documents to whoever is interested.  For example, in the Counterparty or Mastercoin example, you are storing possibly a ton of data in the blockchain representing transfers of ownerships, that then any client can parse through and figure out who the rightful owner of any asset is.  But if I have a Mastercoin asset of gold, I don't care about a Mastercoin asset of silver, so I don't want to wade through all that crap, and I can just look at all the gold "chain" of ownership, and prove I have what I have.  Am I missing something?

There's no such thing as a minimum fee enforced by miners - it's completely arbitrary and up to miners.  The economics of the situation are simple - if you don't pick up profitable transactions to include, your competitors will in the next block.  While this is non-zero, you would need substantial volume to make up for it.  If your argument is we need to have big blocks to enable fees to match block reward, you'd have to have $1 transactions and a 4x block size, or $.10 block size and a 40x block size (and 40x volume), that was full.  That was the whole point - arbitrarily selecting an income model for miners doesn't maximize revenue for them nor is it especially useful.

It might blow your mind, but there's actually a whole scripting language as part of the transaction protocol, and you can send much more complicated transactions than just to an address.

And since I'm tired of this exchange, here's how you do it:
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:39:45
There is no doubt that Halong had to be extremely careful to avoid tipping off Bitmain for many reasons.  The form factor of course looks very similar - there are only so many ways to design boxes that disperse heat efficiently.  Not surprising everyone uses a very similar look for them.  And designing SHA-256 algorithms, again, not much you can do to make it that much more efficient since we are near the end of the silicon limits.
The vast majority of chinese pools are just Jihan/Bitmain fronts, so maybe they'll not support it, but they will be at a significant disadvantage.  It doesn't matter, either they don't support it, and they lose market share, or they do support it.  Miners are moving out of China anyway, so soon it won't matter.  So yes, pools will need to upgrade.  AFAIK, it's all open source and they can do this.  Either they support this feature, or lose out on market share.
Yes, they could try to find another optimization.  However, that's like saying they will just invent flying cars.  AsicBoost methods have been known for years, and even so, no one has been able to find anything better.  Doing so will require significant research and development.  It will take years.
And yes, S9's will soon be as useful as space heaters.  Bitmain has the opportunity to begin to play nice and abandon their monopolistic practices, or they will get crushed into irrelevance.  Which might be their choice, since they are eying the "central bank crypto partner" pivot at this time.

I'm not saying it's a good idea.
A blockchain would give a record to people that you just have to trust with a database, if everyone has a copy, and you have rules about rewriting history, nodes would reject a rewritten history in this case.

This is where the idea of charging $.001 per hash falls apart.  I just bulk things myself.
Though, one part I haven't put much detail into is the supposed claim that it proves that you *didn't* put some data into Factom.  Having a master document requires you reveal everything you could have put into the chain and prove there's nothing else.  Probably possible, but it's a bit different than just proof of existence.

How is it going to fail?  Because it's entire business model is based on stealing electricity from stupid people who don't notice it.  There is no reason why inefficient mining devices will be able to compete against efficient operations in a race to the bottom.
And no, IoT doesn't need every device to mine.  Each device could be set up with an initial balance and replenished over time if needed without any need for mining.  I don't need to mine to use  Bitcoin right now, there's no reason why my fridge would need to.

The fidelity stuff is just, from what I understand, not really a transaction involving Bitcoin, but just timestamping information.
The value added by paying fees is extremely minimal (someone does need to acquire coins for this purpose), so if that's what we want, we are better off letting fees raise high so holders can sell for more profit.
@_date: 2015-09-03 21:23:38


This is just Hearn propaganda.  It is in no ways true. If miners do not want to follow what people want, they will be mining a worthless alt-coin, and miners who are smart enough to see their mistake will go back to mining a coin with value within the parameters of the network.

Sounds like Hearn's nonsense is rubbing off on you.  Hearn is the one saying "long chain wins, derp, who cares about validity!"
The current plan does require mining from the majority of miners.  But, when it fails, I'm sure Mike will just decide to make an incompatible version and start with a smaller set of miners.
Miners attacking is expensive and has a real cost.  It's something where you'd prefer other miners attack rather than you, so it's a bit overestimated in how much of an attack would happen.
Voting for miners is a good way to signal intent, especially when they can take unilateral action, as is the case with soft forks.  But the second they start wagging the dog, there will be a serious threat of altering the POW algorithm to bankrupt the miners.  We can see very quickly who is wagging who.
@_date: 2015-09-23 18:12:20
If you believe the price of Bitcoin will go up, you are better served buying Bitcoin now, unless you can mine it under the cost it costs now to buy.  If you prefer to hold Bitcoin, you need to measure the cost in Bitcoin, not dollars.  You can get roughly 2.75 BTC for $400, so the device better mine 2.75BTC to be worth it for you.
If you prefer to hold dollars, then the only thing that matters is the price of Bitcoin when you mine it, and in that case, if you require Bitcoin to go up, you were better off buying Bitcoin and selling in the future anyway.

The "largest computing network in the world handling it" is a misunderstanding of the issue.  Mining is one issue, and all miners are are devices that turn electricity into heat and sometimes get lucky.  That's not a very "useful" network other than proving work is being done (which is a very useful part, but its not really processing anything).
Off-chain can be done in a wide variety of ways from completely trusted and insecure to fairly secure with only mild attacks that can be done.

This assumes that there needs to be some constant level of support denominated in Bitcoins, that goes to the miner.  If Bitcoin's value goes up, miners make more in real value.  Or it doesn't and they don't make as much.  OP still has not described why this is a *real* problem.


Assumes this is a problem.  That's not a safe assumption.


[citation needed]


If this is the case, the value is up a lot, therefore miners get more fees in real value.

Because we have a significant number of miners SPV miners, and it only takes a small number to lie about intent to screw over a ton of other miners by making them mine a soon-to-be-orphaned fork.

If you are trying to find a working business model, there's no need for VC and scaling.  VC capital is all about scaling a business that needs scaling.  The whole BitPay thing was about trying to get as many merchants on board because once you had all the merchants, profit, or something.  I do wonder how much of their business model was built on top of floating Bitcoin, hoping it would continue to rise.  That had to take a hard hit with the price drop.

If your block is slow to propagate, you keep working on that block, others don't.  If you find another block in that time, and others are still working on the previous block, your two blocks, even when propagating slowly, will win out.  You don't need to magically speed it up.

Transactions can be really big, even if it was fixed per KB, miners get their own fees, so it's pointless.
@_date: 2015-09-02 18:12:29
Why would someone pay to get a free spot?  Because it would allow them access that they otherwise wouldn't get.  Say there are 1MB worth of transactions that go into the 900KB of "paying" spots, and 500KB of free transactions waiting to get into the 100KB of free space.  A miner would rather have someone pay them for prioritizing for getting in the line ahead, and someone paying a small out of band fee would be cheaper or faster than waiting in line for the paying spots.
Are you putting a cap for the amount of free or cap for amount of paying?
If it's a cap for amount of free, then the opposite could happen- a miner makes a deal with someone to give a refund up to some amount to allow them to get in, making it look like they are paying a fee but not really.
There's no way to effectively police what a miner decides to get into a block or not, other than following protocol consensus rules.

They could have, you know, had a normal IPO process with a Dutch Auction or Reverse blind auction and set an amount to be sold and let people bid on the price, and let people make rational decisions, but this isn't intended to be about rational decisions.  Or they are just morons.

I'm not sure how you'd say it's like POS.  It's more of escrow.  If I make a connection with you, we both put up some coins that get locked up.  I make lots of connections to other people.  They do the same.  Eventually everyone is connected through some paths on the network.  You want to make a payment, you pay me, I take a small cut, and pay the next person in line (who takes a cut) until it makes it to the end.  For this to work, I need to have money tied up so that if I need to pay someone down the chain, I have funds already escrowed with them.

They need someone sourcing the cards that cheap.  This model has existed for a while, and it basically always comes down to stolen cards.  Look at other sites, it's never that much off: 
But yes, I agree that spending coins when it makes sense is a good idea!  Artificial support of Bitcoin "transactions" where it is not beneficial is useless, though there are places where the benefits of Bitcoin work very well (for example, funding gambling sites with high levels of chargebacks, or even failure to do business with US banks).
@_date: 2015-04-02 15:00:09
No, I mean I send a contract to two people for the same thing, say I transfer a title to two people.  What keeps me from double-spending?  In Bitcoin, it's because everyone sees the blockchain, and only one valid transaction can be added spending each output.  In a system not honored by the protocol, you have a bunch of messages, and the protocol rules of those messages determine which is valid.  But until I can scan the entire chain and prove that you don't have a title as well as myself, I am not safe from double spend.
Proof of existence is easy.  Proof of non-existence is harder.

Furthermore, it would be incredibly dumb for miners to prioritize this way.  The 2 block limit is also a bit weird, why so small?  Variance of block times is pretty high, so why not make it so that when there are lucky blocks in a row after a backlog, there's plenty to fill.

A permissioned ledger doesn't really compete with Bitcoin - it's tuned for solving its problems, and an open ledger like Bitcoin is tuned for solving its problems well.

I have no idea what you are getting at or why it relates.  There are instantaneous power auctions for electricity that have a market, but you can't have speculators buying electricity and storing it for later for these markets.
However, it may be possible for services to "guarantee" inclusion, and be on the hook if they don't get in.  Maybe this is the solution you are looking for?

You say this like there are universal things good or bad for Bitcoin (even adoption is one that isn't universal).  Things for Bitcoin is it continues on in a secure way.

Correct, you didn't account for this.  Either the tx rate is &lt;1MB/10mins and the mempool and you can't fill 4MB blocks, or the tx rate is &gt;1MB/10 mins, which causes 1MB block nodes to consume infinite memory.

It's a matter of paying with a super low fee that never would have gotten confirmed, and sending another transaction to a few miners.  There were scripts for this.


You act like someone is jacking up fees.  This is the invisible hand of the marketplace, not an act of jacking it up.  You want to interfere with that.


So basically the equivalent of a bus driver in IT.


You have shown you have no understanding of how Bitcoin works.  Miners don't control Bitcoin. Did you miss the Ethereum fork?  You can't force people to accept something just because miners do.  I'll reject miners who choose to mine an altcoin.  You have a complete lack of coordination in this system, you have replay attacks.  For what?

Majority of nodes doesn't mean anything.

This could result in a network split if users didn't upgrade and the majority of miner started ignoring the SegWit rules.

Bitcoin Classic was poorly thought out and had a weak development team, but it's orders better than Unlimited.  Unlimited will ultimately destroy any kind of confidence in consensus, have constant forks, and ultimately, put the miners in sole control.  It's an abomination.

That doesn't mean it's "supposed" to be that way forever.
The fact that Satoshi missed this shows he was a bright guy (or set of people), but didn't have everything figured out.  Bitcoin cannot be functional based on a set of gentlemen agreements.


This really wouldn't have helped.  Things will always go to where there is power the cheapest.
IMO, the biggest thing he screwed up was having miners even have to evaluate transactions.  That should have been a user-level item.  Just have miners store data, up to some limit, and let users determine what is valid, what isn't.


Citation needed
You don't see it working?  The same techniques will be used - go to miners, show them charts showing them riches, and dangers if they don't follow.  Get them to try to force users to use that.


Miners really don't make decisions, other than to try to pursue the most profit.  Users will give information for that.

It's a redefinition of an existing opcode in a backward compatible way.  If you don't care about this feature, you won't lose money.  You will accept blocks that miners will reject, but since miners won't be producing any invalid blocks (or those that do get orphaned quickly, with the 95% threshhold), you do not end up with anything corrupt.
Why is it preferable?  Because it does not require people who do not care about it to upgrade, and does not have the coordination problems a hard fork exists.  It also does not end up with two competing chains that end up going on forever.

In-person spending of Bitcoins is not a terribly useful use case.  This is a solved problem with other means and Bitcoin does it very poorly (even with LN).  Using Bitcoin where it has strong advantages is the key, rather than trying to jam it into use cases it makes no sense.
Yes, many use cases stop making sense at different levels.  Fees will price things so that they are used most efficiently and alternatives will pop up for use cases that are no longer viable.  You can have considerable amount of functionality with 1MB and likely would be fine for a considerable amount of time - enough time to try to help with the problems that larger blocks would likely cause and technology to improve.

Reddit is a shitty platform for discussion.  It's a great platform for sharing cat pictures or AMAs.
Upvotes and down votes are not "intended" to be based on whether a post is "I agree" or "I disgaree", but evolve into that.  Especially when you can silence people you disagree with.
Furthermore, has rules where a small number of accounts can "flag" posts, and have them deleted, regardless of content, hidden from the moderation logs.
In any case, Reddit by default does not align with Roger Ver's goal of openness and censorship free platforms, but he has some simple tools he can put in place to fix that.  He refuses.  So I'll call him on his hypocrisy.

To be fair, we probably have way more security than needed right now, and either intentionally or accidentally, we ended up with such a model so that we could bootstrap the network to a high level before anyone would be able to do anything about it.
I'm not as worried if the (relative) hash rate does fall in the future, though.  Incentives are such that you must give up a lot in order to attack.  Nation states have better tools at their disposal than trying to double spend on the network or roll back transactions.  They simply regulate, co-opt, or use social engineering techniques to destroy value.  Far cheaper.  Just hire someone to concern troll and split the network through hard forks.

Without a fee market, there is no security for Bitcoin in the long run.
I am not asking fees to equal 25btc per block.
The fee market can only develop through miners who refuse transactions without fees, which only happens when there is either 1) a cost in including an extra transaction to the block to the miner (which isn't the case for large miners, who actually benefit from slow to validate blocks) or 2) there is limited space in blocks.

Well, I understand why the company creates wealth.
What I think you find hard to understand, is that Bitcoin creates wealth too, by allowing certain things to happen, that people want, that otherwise wouldn't.  Things you despise and hate, but add wealth and value to people's lives.  And people like you, who suck on the teat of slavery, no longer can stop.
@_date: 2015-11-12 20:37:41
Tx Fees certainly could be part of it.
Dilution on a sidechain also could happen, which is equivalent to increasing the total number of coins.
@_date: 2015-11-12 15:20:49
True for LN but not for Sidechains.  In Sidechains, coins can live as long as they want on the sidechain.  Think of sidechains as an alt-coin that doesn't have its own currency, instead you "borrow" them from Bitcoin.  It gives all the interesting parts of alt-coins (different rules, different features, different security models) without competing against Bitcoin the currency.

Yes, people made profit.  Where are the offsetting losses?


But the guy who bought at $1200 has something valuable.


Madoff's investors had zero assets backing up their investment.


How does this follow?
Let me start with something less controversial:  Someone founds a company that makes computers, let's call it "Pear Computers".  They offer shares for $1 and sell a million of them.  After 25 years, the shares are now worth $1000 each.  Did someone lose money here, or was wealth created?
@_date: 2015-11-12 18:38:41
Front running is taking knowledge of a trade that has not been made yet, and moving your order in front of it.
Example:  I am a broker, and my client says he is going to sell 1M shares of XOM.  I need to execute the trade for him.  So I first short XOM, then I execute his trade, then I close my position.  This harms my client because my short will drive the price down a bit before he is even able to sell. 
Low latency takes advantage of trades/orders that already occur.  You can use this to try to "correct" the market faster than others.  It actually can increase liquidity. 
Example: Someone sells 1M shares of XOM driving the price down, and I realize that it's probably a big player selling that will eventually get eaten up in the market.  I buy cheaper, then re-sell when it starts going back up based on this knowledge.
They will find out about this trade sooner than others, but it's not like they are under obligation to the people with slow connections to act in their interests.

With a market of fees it will be different, they will be inactivated to send to the bigger pool and pay them directly. (and the pool asking for paying in advance, as a subscription)
Or they could just pay a fee and the next miner picks it up.  And this has nothing to do with Lightning in particular.




I think you have this misconception of what a hub is and thinking there is some association with a miner.  It's not even really a hub and spoke system, it's p2p.

It was trivial to double-spend even before RBF.  This has been proven over and over again.


There's no reason we need it all at once.  If fees are actually too high, people will switch to using it.  If not, it's not so urgent, is it?

Open source development is a bit tricky, where you can see an opportunity in the future, but you put up the work up front, and others benefit from it and you gain little from it personally, other than being the expert on it.

I agree there is a tx backlog.  Show me how that slows adoption.


Yes, because merchant adoption doesn't drive user adoption.  It's been played out 2-3 years ago, and it didn't do shit.

I do like this new approach of avoiding the SEC in the IPOCoins.  How much access does one Factoid give me?  Oh wait, its a currency that I can use to trade for something else that I can trade for something else, and then have a unicorn shit out another coin to magically give me something to put on the chain.
The price is variable, and even if it wasn't, there's nothing to stop servers from requiring a payment in factoids/energy credits/magic beans along with something valuable.  There is zero incentive to hold Factoids longer than what you might need in a very short period, therefore the price will be very, very close to zero.  Except at the IPO time... errr I mean "software presale", of course.

So X Factoids come onto the market through "inflation" every day.  Y Factoids are consumed every day to convert to entry credits.  Number of entry credits consumed is B.  Assume X=Y for now, which would mean no hoarding and immediate consumption.
To simplify the process, assume there is a daily sale of entry credits for $, and a daily release of Factoids.  If the number of entry credits increase, the $ coming in increases, and the Factoids released daily remain the same (is this correct)?.   This Factoids would rise (in terms of dollars) in this case if the # of entries increase, and cost of entries remain the same in terms of dollars.
Is anything wrong here so far?
Thank you for your patience.

You are mistaking a current feature that may or may not be there in the future as a key feature.  It's not there, and there's no promise of it.  The ability to work with untrusted parties is the other huge advantage, as you do not need to establish any kind of relationship to have payments.

To be honest, it may very well be this, I never could get questions answered.  If it's the latter, you end up with users who get stuck on a minority chain without being aware, which ends up with tons of forks (Peter handwaves and assumes everyone will realize this and converge by either setting their limits high or not, aka emergent consensus).
So your options are everyone getting their own fork, or the miners controlling the network.

Sidechains are one way to do that.  And changes have happened before, and probably will, as long as they are pretty close to unanimous.  The block size increase proposal is the first major test.  It's a semi-controversial change that the die-hards will fight and ignore, and plenty of people will jump on board.  Based on that, we'll learn a lot about semi-controversial hard forks.

So if this is the case, you have a case for speculators, who anticipate growth of Factom usage, and buy some when it's cheap, and sell over time when usage increases.  Once you hit a steady-state, then all are consumed daily.
You have the first serious problem if the price is set incorrectly at $.001 per credit.  A competitor pops up or alternative pops up at a cheaper rate, and then you have zero usage.  What mechanisms are in place for maintaining a competitive pricing for Entry credits?  This seems a lot like central planning.  This is especially problematic since there is no real network effect (unless I'm missing something), and you have an open source protocol that uses Factoid2s and gives the same service.
The pre-sale is problematic as well, as you have no reasonable knowledge of what percentage of Factoids you will get for your investment, thus no ability to price them properly.  That's a big potential problem, whereas something like a Dutch Auction solves the issue of having to guess what other participants will do to value what you are buying.  Factoids by themselves have no direct value, only the percentage of what you own.
The last big issue is the inflation rate is not really clearly defined, and can have a significant effect on the value.  If you are creating 20% of the initial Factoids per year or per day, it's a huge difference.  This needs to be squared away way before the crowd sale.
The nature of burning certainly makes this more desirable than most Appcoins.  The speculative nature will allow for the potential for some growth, since there's a reasonable chance of project failure with the tokens being completely worthless (even you said, most projects fail).
Until the issues above are resolved, it's nearly impossible to make any kind of rational investment in the crowd sale.  This may be intentional, especially since the nature of the uncapped sale.  That could be a mistake in that a lot of investors who might view the project as a potential success, having only investors who have no idea what they are doing and just gambling.  But it's certainly a lot better than I originally thought, and thanks for sticking through it.  Even if I had a reasonable expectation for a certain number of entries happening per day in the future at a given likelihood, there's no proper way to value Factoids now.

None of those are App Coins, with the exception of Bitcoin.  All are redeemable for something.  This argument was debunked on LTB.
It's possible you guys aren't dishonest and are just idiots, though.  I'll grant you that.
1) Bitcoin - is an AppCoin.  But also is a form of money, superior to fiat in many ways, which is why it has value and people are willing to hold it.  Also has significant friction to obtain or convert with other forms of money.
2) MPesa - directly redeemable for something useful at a fixed rate.
3)  Tokens - directly redeemable at a fixed rate for something useful.  Also sold at a discount (outside of a store) or immediately consumed.  No one holds tokens unless accidentally.
4)  Gold - Value determined by fixed rate - you can purchase X for Y gold in the game.  There is incentive to hold it since this rate is set.
5)  Airline miles - redeemable for something based on value, and would be sold at a discount.  Not really comparable.  Sells at a discount (if even transferrable).
6)  Redeemable at a fixed rate.  Sell at a discount.
7)  Redeemable at a fixed rate.  Sell at a discount.
8)  Redeemable at a fixed rate for dollars.  Not comparable.  Unless talking tournament chips, which have zero value.
None of these matter, except Bitcoin, which is unique.  Unless you are arguing that Factoids are superior to Bitcoin in terms of money, or factoids are particularly difficult to obtain when needed, there is no reason to hold Factoids over Bitcoin, other than the brief period of time you are using them to access your system.  Which will put their value as close to zero as possible, given that velocity will be significant, even if your system gets significant usage.

A lot of assumptions in there.  Let's not make assumptions and work through this logically.  Nor leap to conclusions like it has to be a currency.  The question is: why would anyone want to hold Factoids?  In particular, why should anyone invest in this token sale.
The only reason I have seen is:
1) I'm a Factom server and I get paid in Factoids for contributing to the network.
2) I can acquire them now at a price less than someone will pay me for them in the future.

It's hard to justify investing in something that there's a reasonable chance it isn't going to be "needed" for a long time, especially if Gavin's proposal goes through.  The block size increase proposal is equivalent to setting the minimum wage to $.01 an hour.  It would have virtually no effect compared to having no limit in the short term.
Better to prove this technology on a use case where it would be more beneficial, get the kinks worked out, and modify nodes to require this kind of payment.  Then again, if the blockchain blows up and casual nodes disappear, this model might become profitable naturally for nodes.

Don't understand why it varies or how that happens, and assuming it to be fixed at least makes it easier to understand.


Sure, you can donate them.  Selling them usually costs you more fees than its worth.  The key is, you can't reasonably sell them to someone.  Which is fine, just limits their value.


Let's agree on what is meant by "hold".  Hold I mean keep for a period of time longer than what is necessary to use them.  I hold dollars because I may miss out on opportunities to buy things if it's tied up in less liquid (but more productive) assets.  I hold productive assets because they increase in value or are otherwise useful to me.  I hold unproductive/consumable assets when it's expensive to obtain them when I need them.
Entry credits are much like a consumable (consider it like food in your pantry).  They are a means to an end and provide no direct value until consumed.  Why do I stockpile food?  I hate going to the grocery store every day, so that's one reason.  In case of emergencies and not being able to obtain food during such an emergency is another.
So why would I hoard entry credits?  If purchasing them is a pain (maybe they are so cheap, and there is a tx fee to buy them, I need to buy them in bulk, so I buy 1000 of them at a time, and just hoard them).  Or maybe I buy them now because it would be more expensive to buy them in the future.  Maybe you have other good reasons that I would prefer to have a lot of energy credits rather than a more flexible currency like Bitcoin.


Do not understand this.  Someone steals your entry credits key, can't they just post entries into the ledger until you use them?  Not sure how it's relevant to the discussion, which is "are Factoids worth buying".


Ok, so if they have fixed value in dollars, then you have a gift card.  Which is fine, it has a value, but investing in a Gift card is silly, and buying gift cards at anything other than a gift or discount is silly.
So I think I have a reasonable understanding of the economics needed in this, and will just assume the protocol works (big assumption, there are a LOT of moving parts, and the chances of getting everything right is very low).
So the question is- why would anyone buy Factoids other than immediately before needing them to convert to entry credits to use in the ledger.  The only reason to hold entry credits is obtaining them as needed is unfeasible (too small of value each to buy individually).  Am I missing anything?

Except Bitcoin was accepted as a store of value far before it became useful.
Bitcoin is only useful because other people view it as a store of value.  You have it completely backwards.

Good.  This is the Core Roadmap.  Scale safely within limits while minimizing splits.  Allow organic growth to the 2MB range.  Evaluate from there.

Instant confirmations represent very few actual reasons.  In-person trustless payments have a solution- cash.
BTW, average block time whenever a payment is paid is still 10 minutes.
Trustless cheap micropayments are also not something that are terribly needed - as they could be done in several other forms - with altcoins that have less security, bulk payment to an entity then credited (this is the most common method).  And they are low value transactions.
Privacy is certainly increased, but the current model is sufficient for the vast majority of transactions and other means that might be more expensive are still viable when you really need privacy.
I can understand the paranoia a little bit - it comes from something very simple, though.  If you see a problem that exists and a potential solution - that is how you can benefit by creating that solution.  However, your incentives are such that you need that problem to be solved by your solution.  This gets people who think that you are trying to cause the problem rather than point it out.
@_date: 2015-11-04 19:05:59
0-conf usability would be the same as it is now.  Use for trusted positions or where little can be lost.  Nothing is being broken that isn't already broken.
The nuances of "accept it in these cases but no others" is difficult to get right and really should be done with extreme caution, rather than the norm.  People would be far better to just not worry about 0-conf (we have cash to use for in person instant transactions) use cases, and just use an actual secure model.  Accept 0-conf when you would accept a check without any validation of its validity.
@_date: 2015-11-10 14:55:06
It's an optimization that saves some, but doesn't get beyond 2x scaling of what you had, and it only works when others are playing nice (sending transactions you already have).  You still need to get the transactions anyway, and you need to know how to order them to form the block.

There are very few use cases where 0-conf fall apart - you typically would do it in-person and have some identification of who you are dealing with if they try to scam you.  It's no different than accepting a check.  If you can do that safely, you can accept 0-conf safely.

If 51% of miners upgrade, you'll see two forks - small block fork and big block fork.  If the small block fork ever temporarily outruns the big fork, the big fork is then reversed and miners would start mining on top of the small chain until a new fork is created.

Marginal cost even in economies of scale is rarely negative, but it drops a lot.  Bitcoin is unique with miners, as you can actually harm your competition while benefiting yourself.


Unsophisticated miners today does not mean the theory is broken.  There's a cap on the block size which prevents things from getting too warped.

This is incorrect.  Tokens only have value if someone finds value in holding them.  There is no rational reason to hold a factoid, as they can be obtained to access the protocol on demand.  Are you guaranteeing some kind of access rate per factoid, or is it a moving rate?

Best case scenario, a single PC would validate a 1GB block in 137 seconds.
Storage requirements would be 53TB/year.  Good luck on that one without a datacenter.
Now consider bandwidth.  Lots of capped data plans.  In an optimized situation, you are talking 10Mbps down just for keeping up with the chain.  To send to a single peer, another 10Mbps up.

Yes, profit/incentive are basically interchangable here.
I'm not saying one ought to do something so that something gets built, but simply that a profit potential is what will really grow this area.  Things tend to grow much faster when there is a way to profit from building them.  Sure, things do get built for the love of it, but profit can go a long way.
I do not think we should do anything simply to force the issue, but rather, the argument "it's not built yet, therefore it doesn't count" is flawed.  Things tend to not get built until there is an actual reason to build them.

With no hoarding, the value of X factoids must support the volume of entries written into Factom per day.
Yes, as long as velocity is not infinite, and there is some value in using them, they would have some value.  The key is how much value, especially since there is a pre-sale of them coming up.  Smart investors will want to know why they are buying something.
So there's no reason to own a Factoid until you need it.  That sounds like the value will be as low as possible for the usage.


Let's not jump to conclusions and work to that logically.  The reason to hold Factoids is because you believe they might be worth more in the future.  Is this correct?  One step at a time.

Currency is different in that it is subject to whims and I can get my money devalued at their whims.  If someone is holding an asset for me, that's a bad time for centralization.  If someone is just doing business with me, I don't really care.  As long as I have a choice of providers, who cares?


We'll see what the market decides about centralization on this.  I'm not sure it matters.  Add in Johnston's involvement and constant insistence on selling tokens, and you can see where skepticism reigns.

And as a consumer, I would much prefer to have reversibility.  So the merchant offers what the consumer wants, and accounts for that risk.  Businesses with high amounts of chargebacks are well served by accepting Bitcoin, although even Bitcoin users would strongly prefer the chargeback method for their own protection in most cases.  This leads to an adverse selection, where only honest people use Bitcoin and scammers will still use chargebacks, or you refuse to accept PayPal and credit, and then you lose 99% of your customers.

The fact it is arbitrary does not mean it isn't important.  It also doesn't need to be optimal.
Satoshi's intentions are also irrelevant.  The only part that matters is what the effects are on changing it.
Changing a parameter of a system that works because it might not be optimal introduces a great deal of risk with very little benefit.
For example, it's entirely arbitrary that the game of football has a 100 yard field, or baseball has 90 feet between bases.  Maybe baseball would be better if it was 100 feet or 80 feet.  Entirely arbitrary, but changing the rules in the middle of a game without any research or results because it is arbitrary is worse than having a potentially "sub-optimal" game.

Expanding the block size is also theoretical.  We may find downsides there, too.

@_date: 2015-10-16 01:12:57
It's a new idea, so there are a lot of things that need to really be worked out and see what incentives really exist, and poking holes is the first step.
It's not about skipping over blocks (although they could, which is a different attack), but about re-writing microblocks to have a double-spend.  The only penalty for a miner doing that is losing the reward.  You only identify miners that make their identity known anyway.  And identifying does not really protect against fraud.
There may still be advantages to this over the current system, but making faster confirmations without risk is not really one of them.

1) Isn't going to drive value, it will decrease value.  Being stuck with something I don't have a use for and just need to sell is simple increase of supply without demand.  No worries, this happens with miners today in the Bitcoin world.

Just because both involve unknowns doesn't mean it's identical.
No one buys Google Stock at IPO knowing what the price will be in the future.  But they know the price they are paying relative to the value they get (stake in the company).  This is worse because you have no idea what stake you are even getting (in terms of Factoids).  It's like saying you'll buy Google Stock for $20, but having no idea what the float is.

It's not just storage space.  It's bandwidth requirements.  It's effect on when you disconnect for a while.  All of these are effects toward pushing away from running a full node.  How strong?  That's where we cannot be certain, but it certainly has *some* impact.
Pruning has an affect as well. You aren't able to contribute back as a full node.  Someone that needs that info to validate needs to look at fewer places and is more susceptible to attacks.

Imagine you have an image of a check you send to someone.  Someone takes this check, and puts an extra "0" in front of the first number, so instead of paying $12.23, it says $012.23.  It's still for the same amount, still to the same person, and still valid.  However, if someone is taking pictures of every check, they'll notice you have two checks with the same number out there.  Eventually, one of the copies of the check will confirm in the blockchain, and it will straighten itself out.

That's not really true, though, unless you count storage of value as a use.
Say for example that there was a very useful system that was used, but it's token was inflated at 100% per day.  But it had awesome security, was instant, fraud proof, etc....  It's token would be very useful (assuming it had any value at all), but no one would hold it any length of time, and it's value would be very close to 0 (assuming it wasn't 0).
If the USD was only accepted at 7/11 already assumes it has no storage of value.  Because no one prefers to hold it (otherwise they would accept it).  You basically have everything backwards.  No one wants to hold something that does not hold value, whether or not it can be redeemed somewhere or not.  And no one ever accepts it for redemption (unless they dump it instantly, like using Bitpay), unless they think it is a good store of value.  You'd think 2 years of increased "usefulness" through merchant adoption and continually falling prices would help people realize this, but apparently not.

The question is, why is someone holding a Factoid other than that's what they were paid in (Gift Card), and no one has wanted to convert them yet.

You hold money in your wallet precisely because it is a speculative asset - it allows you to make sure you do not miss an opportunity that you could not otherwise take advantage of by not having that cash.  If the money in your wallet would deteriorate after a week of being in your wallet, you'd probably spend it as fast as possible to get anything you could so you wouldn't lose out.  The money would be worth very little.
Being able to store value *is* useful.  It allows me to produce things now, and defer my receiving of things until the future.  This is extremely useful, as many goods go bad, and allows me to create things in spurts, while consume more continuously.  It also allows the opposite, for me to create over consistent periods of time, consume slightly less, save, and then be able to get something valuable later.
Store of value does not require crazy returns or getting rich, it simply refers to a way to defer a favor of production into the future.


There is no such thing as "socially valuable".  There is only individual preferences.  Sometimes these preferences conflict with each other.  There is no such thing as "net utility" and thinking there is will only lead to errors in logic.

If you judge on content, Johnston made zero valid points and got destroyed, mostly by Pierre.  In fact, most of the debate is seeing Pierre and Daniel just stunned that such dumb logic was used.
Your fundamental misunderstanding on why the dollar has value might be part of why you are viewing this wrongly.
The only way any token has any value is if it is directly transferable for something else valuable (gift card, airline miles), or if someone prefers to hold it as a form of money (gold, dollars, Bitcoins).  Factoids being destroyed rather than passed on is a huge improvement over most Appcoin pure scams.

But settling a LN transaction is the very last thing you do, and speed really isn't important.  If you want a low fee, you can get it easily by paying a low fee and waiting.  Even then, why does Hub X care about your transaction going through fast?

They use them because gift cards are less valuable than the corresponding cash value.  The reason for this should be obvious.  Gift cards are only valuable as gifts, or when purchased at a discount.  So not really relevant.  Plus they represent some fixed value.
Remember, we are only talking about the token having VALUE.  Not whether your protocol works or the system works (which is a requirement for it to even to have consideration for value).  For something to have value, it needs to be directly redeemable for something of value (Chuck E Cheese Token - I can use one token to play a game, I don't pick up a bunch of tokens at an exchange and go in and see what the rate of redemption is for that day based on popularity).  It's pretty fixed.
Todd doesn't criticize the token because he isn't an economist and knows his limits and only is looking at it technically.  Of course, even with that, he concludes, he's highly skeptical the token will have any value.  So that's two strikes - one from technical side, one from simple economics of money.
Yes, when Vitalik calls your system too complex, you have a major problem.


Dancing in circles.  Why did I say you had to be a non profit?  You could have gotten investors and provided a valuable service as a for profit enterprise.  This did not happen.  I question why.  Again, it's an overly complex mechanism that is a solution searching for a problem, where the requirement is to require some extra token to be sold.


I'm giving you a freebie on this one!  I'll assume it actually works!  Yet it still fails the economic test. 


So either Factoids aren't going to go up in value, in which case, why buy in a presale, or they might go up in value! in which case, susceptible to D Johnston pump and dump tactics that follow him throughout his history.

The 7tx/sec number just assumes what parts settle then.  There are so many better ways to handle the bulk of the operation.  The key feature of the first layer is a guaranteed inflation rate over time.  That just cannot be replicated elsewhere.  There are cryptographically based transaction systems that are much more well suited for fast transactions (Open Transactions, Lightning, Off-Chain Multiparty Federations, etc...).
Saying the numbers are probably right is just guessing.  This is an extremely complicated system with many feedback variables, attacks that haven't even been conceived, and an already overly-centralized mining network.  To be honest, we probably have the number too high!  The other factor that's interesting is with rewards continuing to half, the dynamics of the situation change greatly into uncharted territories as fees take up a larger portion of the income of miners.
There is so much frivolous use of the blockchain right now, we do have a ton of room to expand.  Bitcoin as a settlement layer will stay useful with fairly significant fee increases (10-100x where we are today), which shows we have quite a bit of time.  Yes, we lose out on coffees and other uninteresting use cases.  But that pain will drive other solutions needs and should provide a financial incentive to get that work done.

Solution assumes a problem.  Volatility exists until there is a sufficient size where advanced trading can occur.  The problem is, no one quite knows what Bitcoin will really be worth in a few years.  That leads to volatility.  Thinking otherwise is like thinking it would be great if people could flap their arms and fly.
There are solutions for this.  You can lock the value of your Bitcoin in dollars, and switch before a purchase.  As a merchant you can have people pay you in Bitcoin and have it converted to dollars.

Unless you get a dumb loan, cars will depreciate roughly at the value of the loan, so it's not really that bad.  Houses depreciate, but property appreciates, so again, usually not as bad.  Most loans are at reasonable interest rates because there is collateral as well.  Anyone loaning money for you to buy Bitcoins is going to be giving you a huge rate, or is a fool.
Dumping money you cannot afford (aka getting a loan) into an asset that may go up 100% in a few weeks or go down 80% in a few weeks is pretty silly.
Yes, he could sell it off because his timing was lucky.  Getting a loan for Bitcoins when they were $1000 or $800 or $600 or $400 would not have that luxury.  If you can afford to gamble, great, but if you cannot, you are setting yourself up for disaster.

Ok, so now we are worrying about pure speculation part.
So you have two reasons for speculation:
1) Tulip-mania.  You expect a greater fool to exist down the road.  People will speculate for this reason.
2) Fundamental value changes over time.
Let's ignore 1 for now, as it pretty much means that eventually the bottom falls out since there's a limit on the number of fools out there.
For  to be true, we need to work backwards on Entry credits.  Entry credits only go up in cost (relative to Bitcoin) when the Bitcoin protocol TX fees go up.  Since you are basing this on some rate (1/100-1/1000th... still not sure why there is a range) and that is calculated into the burn exchange rate, not much controversy here.  And since you never hold Entry Credits longer than needed (no incentive to do this, since constant rate, and easily obtainable), that value will be pretty fixed.
What changes is the exchange rate of Factoids for Entry Credits.
Any disputes so far?
So I need some clarification here, I looked in the whitepaper, could not find this, and I know you mentioned it.  Factoids are generated and given to participating servers that do the processing, at some inflation rate based on the initial supply.  Am I missing anything here?  Is it a fixed rate per server?  Fixed based on how much they contribute?  Fixed based on how many entry credits each gives access to?  This is the missing piece.
@_date: 2015-03-19 00:56:16


How many energy credits does a Factoid entitle me to?  What does an energy credit entitle me to?  You are missing the bigger issue, as I'm not debating whether Factom would or would not work regardless of price of Factoids.  The entire debate is that Factoids themselves will retain little to no value.  Regardless of how successful your project is.  Why in the world would anyone HOLD Factoids?  I can answer that for Bitcoins.  I can answer that for every other thing you list that has value (and a lot of them is, because I CAN'T get rid of it without taking a huge loss or paying a large fee).  No one has ever answered why holding a Factoid is a good idea.  It's a fundamental misunderstanding of how money works and why people prefer to hold money.
I know what a token at chucky cheese gets me.  I know what frequent flier miles get me.  What does a Factoid actually get me?


You should listen to the debate if you actually want to know what you are getting into and defend this nonsense.  Instead of just parroting what the maestro is sending down (with the nosense of reward points).  They pinned him in a corner, and asked him if he would prefer a gift card to a single store, or cash, and he knew he was screwed, and somehow tried to weasel out and say "well, maybe a gift card, if I got it cheaper" or some nonsense.  It was the 5 D's of dodgeball from him, and it was clear who was the winner.


There's no reason why Daniel would waste his time on this.  In fact, I'm finding it a bit silly I am, and it's almost to the point where let fools and their money be parted.  But, this silly little conscience of mine combined with schadenfreude of seeing the appcoin scam model fail drives me to waste too much time on reddit.
I'm not talking anything about the protocol.  Sure, it's more complicated than needed by a lot (as even Peter Todd suggested) simply because the requirement of any D Johnston investment to include a rube goldberg token system of running tokens through a unicorns ass so he can presell them and profit after getting an initial cut at a discount, or through a pump and dump scheme, but that's besides the point.


Sure, you could, if there were investors that were accredited and actually would invest in such nonsense.  I seem to think going this route makes me think there isn't a good plan, so that's why the target is naive investors who are afraid to "miss out" on the next big token, or hope to flip it for a profit before it becomes worthless.  So you invent something 10x more complicated than needed, because it doesn't fit the predetermined model of appcoin scams.

It's a move by desperate folks who need another bubble to not be at a loss, who want any kind of news or growth to bring their investments back above water.


Of course, this is assuming we don't have something successful right now.  


Far from true.  The value of a currency only is based on the willingness of someone to hold it.  You'd have to have Ether be a preferred currency to hold, not use, or make it so hard to obtain or very illiquid.
Most of these urgent needs to change things are basically under the assumption that we have failed if we don't get some kind of explosive VC-like growth, or just reek of desperation.
I'm unaware of anything where "you can't do that with Bitcoin yet" use cases are, or how they add any value.  I think you are just making that mistake again where assuming any time someone "uses" bitcoin to bloat the blockchain, that automatically makes tokens more valuable.  The usefulness of the network and the value of the token are quite decoupled!

Established or not has no bearing.
Even with VC, you know exactly what stake you are getting.  Sure it may get diluted, but you don't even have that in this case!  And when it's diluted in the future, they add cash to the equation, which doesn't decrease your value.  If you held a 2nd Factoid Sale, where Factom Foundation got all the cash, it would dilute Factoid holders with no increase in value.
However, I figure this design is a feature and not a bug.
@_date: 2015-03-02 22:22:26
Supermajority of miners doesn't mean anything if they decide to mine an alt-coin.
The engineering tradeoff is the tradeoff between amount of transactions per block and how much resources it takes to run a node.  If you make the block size too big, it becomes extremely centralized to run a node and you have problems.  If it is too small, the network is unusable for any practical purpose.  The key is finding the right balance.
The other problem you are missing is what happens when your node goes offline for any kind of extended period of time - you need to play catchup.  That's a pretty big amount right now.
And you are only looking at the 20MB situation, whereas Gavin's proposal keeps increasing it over and over again, assuming resources will keep up.  Or they don't and we end up with a few data centers that can hold us hostage.

Yep.  And the black market is the most compelling use case for people to adopt.  This is what got random people who have no political motivation to get some coins.  Then add in grey-market gambling sites.  Again, something where people will jump through hoops because there is no other way.  Add in other use cases where trust is hard to come by, the legal system isn't terribly helpful, and you'll have more adoption.  Eventually, it makes sense for people to just accept payments in Bitcoin since it's widely used.
Trying to get old models to adopt Bitcoin with near-zero benefit (or worse, cost) is silly.  Bitcoin needs to do NEW things that cannot be easily done elsewhere.  There are plenty of opportunities for this, but everyone is too busy worrying about paying for their coffee with Bitcoin to actually do this.

One creates a bigger burden on running the node.  That impacts how you interface with Bitcoin.  More people turn to SPVs or end up on relying on trusting nodes.  SPVs rely on trusting miners.

I'd recommend learning why USD has value besides assuming it's for paying taxes.  Hint: Lots of people who don't pay US taxes find the USD valuable.


Because you are clearly very involved with Johnston and seen his explanations on this before. 
I have never seen a gift card not denominated in USD or in terms of an exact item (good for one free meal up to $15).  Yes, a store can raise prices, but it does that with USD as well, so you have a cash equivalent.  Are you claiming Factoids are cash equivalent?
People do not choose to hold tokens unless they have no choice or view they will rise in value.  Which is actually a good counterpoint for you, since Factom servers will be stuck with Factoids to sell for operating.  They end up holding.  And you try to limit your exposure as little as possible in these areas when you can avoid it.  You don't buy 10 years worth of subway cards, you buy what you need that limits transaction costs (including time).  So people will buy entry credits simply to avoid having to buy a fraction of a penny at a time.  But they typically won't hold Factoids unless they are speculating.
Remember, the argument is that the tokens will hold value, not that people will be stuck with them like an unused gift card or other item you'd prefer to have the cash value for them.  Yes, if you create a non-liquid item and hand them to people, they'll have to hold them.  That doesn't give them value.
So the question is, why would someone participate in your crowd sale?  It seems like if you really wanted to make a software presale (which I guess is the legal loophole to this), you'd instead offer Entry Credits at a discount if purchased initially.  But that wouldn't raise enough money, since only people who actually plan on using the protocol would buy them, and the discount would have to be substantial to justify buying an ill-liquid item that has a reasonable chance of being worthless (most projects fail).
Is there even a price set per factoid for the initial batch?

I am yet to see a single skilled developer participating.  Can you tell me which skilled developers are participating?


You don't need to do this.  You can just have it create it on the fly in the code to pad the coinbase appropriately.  This is called good coding practices where your users and customers don't shoot themselves in the foot without relying on others to do what they need.

Number of exchanges means nothing, a lot of the big exchanges did not sign on.  BitGo didn't even sign on.  This has no consensus.

No, they also require the mempool to be in a certain state.


Assuming they have the transactions.


No, I am basing it on the fact that it isn't reviewed by anyone who has any experience in the field.  If a quack doctor comes to me with a new treatment, I don't need to review it to know it's probably unsafe if every qualified doctor out there rejects it.


I never said it was trivial.  It would have been trivial to do this in the code too, but they likely forgot about it.

No, the biggest fear is mining centralization.

If the majority of nodes are not relaying transactions below a certain point, you still have a higher percentage paying higher fees, which ratchets.

There are a couple of problems.  If you stand to gain more than the block reward by cheating, you can do so and benefit.  You also *know* your double-spend will succeed, where a traditional double spend will only allow you to succeed if you are lucky enough.  This makes the benefit much greater in ng.  You can't even really be safe if you accept a small-ish payment and figure it's not worth it for them to steal, since they could have many small payments out that get double-spent.  In the end, we end up waiting for the full confirmation to occur anyway.
Other potential issues - DDOS attacks are possible once the winner is found, since you can attack a single entity rather than the whole network.

No, it's scarce no matter what.  There is only so much space that can be used to store the data.  Maybe you don't understand basic economics to understand the concept of scarcity.  Hell, even if the block size were unlimited, miners would be reluctant to make too big of blocks since they'd be unable to propagate them fast enough to avoid forks.
I'm supporting Bitcoin to buy coffee!  I don't think that needs to be on the block chain, just as dollars can be used to buy coffee, but we don't need a wire transfer for each coffee transaction.
Centralized layers on top of a decentralized system is still decentralized.  Hell, you don't even need that centralized of a solution on top.  But decentralization doesn't get built upon a centralized core.

Not really.  Because I don't know what I'm buying.  This is why you don't see IPOs where you offer unlimited amounts of shares.

With an unlimited ICO, you have no way to make an educated decision on what is going on.  My 1 BTC investment might end up with .000000001% of Factoids or 1%.  I have no clue.

Miners can generate empty blocks, which is what I said, block transactions.  The "attack the network" is something you didn't make clear.  They cannot double spend without a 51% attack.  They cannot violate rules of the network on their own, and a hard fork is a violation of such rules.  They can only do this if others agree to it.

You are talking like it's a sure thing where everyone has decided by 1000 blocks.  If there is any controversy in the change, some will think that A is better, some will think B is better.  A chain gets ahead if miners decide one might be more profitable.  They can very well be wrong.  If the value miners get on the other chain is more, they move back.  Miners will act in their interests.
Those who moved to a chain that they think will be used but isn't, will lose money.  Those that stay on the chain and turns out no one stays with them, will lose money.


Obviously I'm talking about money that is spent AFTER a chain happens.


Why do you assume users will be aware of what is going on?  What about those who don't upgrade?  What if people upgrade, but that chain isn't accepted and people revert back?  Losses all around.
This is why it should be avoided and a fork that leaves this open as a possibility is reckless.

Easy.  You have a wallet on Coinbase.  You have an auto-refill option when spending.  You go to a Coinbase merchant.  You buy "with Bitcoin".  It autodrafts your fiat account, and sends that money the merchant.  Then your coins get moved into your own account, minus the 1% fee.
Spending on a merchant that accepts Bitpay dollars or Coinbase dollars does not distribute Bitcoins.

They are known to be the right magnitude because we have a reasonable level of being able to ascertain what would happen if we moved it considerably larger (or smaller).  Bitcoin being more complicated makes it such that changing the parameters by orders of magnitude is not clear.  And changing it only small amounts (1.2MB for example) gets you virtually nothing you didn't already have.

This happens everywhere.  Any "large" amount of cash is considered suspicious and grounds for further searches.  Furthermore, asset forfeiture does not require any individual being charged with a crime, as the asset is considered part of a crime, and needs to "sue" to be won back, and the costs eat significantly into the amount returned.
Asset forfeiture funds police departments significantly.

No, BIP91 only becomes active after 80% signalling.  BIP148 would activate SegWit even if only 50% of miners enforced it.

I don't mind the model.  I do mind taking advantage of people for investment with false promises and/or extremely flawed models.  Then add in the scams of trying to get rid of worthless Mastercoin with the Maidsafe fiasco by creating false demand, then leaving the companies as bag holders.  Add in the APIcoin fiasco where you try to find a way to dump your unsuccessful project on the public buying up more tokens and magic beans that aren't going to be worth anything.  Your track record is not good.  So consider me skeptical.  It's very hard to distinguish from complete naivety (believing your BS) or just an outright scam.
Yes, those projects were able to do something (I take your word on this, I don't really follow them closely), at the expense of rube investors.

So what?  We follow the longest valid chain (according to the 148 rules).  If miners follow 91, that's their prerogative, not ours. If they don't, then we need to be as strong as ever in support of 148 as its the last chance to get SegWit.

Your inability to think of a way to do it doesn't mean it's impossible.
There are plenty of ways this could be done, for example, parties lock up extra funds, and when released, volatility is taken into account.  Or one party bears the risk of volatility, which is entirely reasonable.

No, probably not if you are asking it.


How many merchants accept Bitcoin and how many use services like Coinbase and Bitpay is a great example.


The only thing that is needed to be known is that at extreme levels it certainly decreases (which is obvious, and if it's not, I can make it that way for you), and that different people have different points where they'll stop.
And running a node or not is the least of the concerns for increasing the block size.

Trivial use cases disappear first.  Bitcoin is one of the greatest monetary inventions of history.  If it is not worth $1 to use, how is it in any way anything more than a toy?

Money is not a productive asset.  Money under a mattress frees up goods now to be purchased cheaper.  This allows consumers to get cheaper goods and investors to make investments (because they have a future demand for goods through savings) and also have lower prices.  The idea that money in a mattress somehow is harming anything is silly.  It is merely delayed consumption, which benefits immediate consumption and investment.

We know how mining works.  Mining revenue trends toward mining costs since difficulty adjusts.  If there are jumps in price, then it can exceed it.
Miners do not benefit from high prices but from beating their competition (long term).  ASICBoost is the key to that win.  The reason for this is if mining revenues temporarily rise, it just encourages more competition and the revenues must be shared by more.

Of course it's hard, but when you get rewarded for taking larger risks that are poorer investments, more of it will happen.  Taking fewer risks is sometimes a good idea.

Scalability is far from trivial, and fungibility can be solved in many known ways with virtually no risk.
@_date: 2015-10-08 16:26:54
But we have a limit, and this completely kills the chance that someone even attempts to put in a huge amount of data.  There's little edge to be gained in sending a huge block, since there is a limit right now - no one can even make an attack by bloating 10-20MB of junk to make slow blocks.
And if you are saying that if we had no block limit, there's not even enough transactions for it, it won't matter, then you should have no objection to a small enough block limit that holds all reasonable transaction usage.
@_date: 2015-10-05 20:11:38
And in the mean time, you have two forks executing, with diverging transactions.  Possibly for weeks or longer if the impact is trivial (the extra pop operation on multisig verification is a great example of a "bug" that doesn't bother anything).

So you want to trust a centralized group of miners for the security of your money.  Who could very well inflate the entire supply of money without your knowledge.
The 20MB size will make it painful, but I'm more worried about the next few upgrades after that.
I'm well aware of SPV.  However, it requires honest full nodes.  Without that, you are left believing something is valid that isn't.  You are just trusting that a bunch of people are telling you something that is true.
Your lack of understanding about the multitude of off-chain transaction options out there does not mean it is not possible.
Your post about wire transfers is a straw man.  Choose a real argument and I'll respond.
My post says nothing about the ideal cost of the network.  Simply that there are tradeoffs.  And whether Bitcoin transactions happen on or off chain doesn't mean they won't happen.  Assuming the solution is where you get into trouble.

I have no idea what you mean by "none of transactions will show up".  Transactions show up, just possibly a different set on each fork.  Not sure why there are a low number of connected nodes - the other nodes on your fork would have trouble finding peers, so you'd eventually find each other.

An ethereum bubble is completely irrelevant to Bitcoin.  In fact, if people get involved in those first, then eventually come on board, as they will as those projects fade, then great!  The marketshare that matters is the global money marketplace, and altcoins are a blip, and still better than the alternative of fiat.  I welcome any success they have at fiat's expense.  That success does not come at Bitcoin's expense, or at least hasn't lately.  The only l reason to care is if you are a short term trader.


I can see why you are concerned and have doubts when you buy into such obvious crap schemes.
@_date: 2016-05-26 18:24:27


Nope.  If it breaks old clients, it's a hard fork.  If everyone comes along, it's Bitcoin, and if not, it's an alt-coin.


No one has ever used the term hard fork in this way, other than people trying to justify promoting alt-coins.
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:38:16
If a bunch of miners decide to mine an alt-coin tomorrow, we aren't screwed, we just have slower block times for a few weeks.  You are vastly overestimating the power of miners.  They can only follow the rules *we* set.
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:27:23
You can claim whatever you want is the default, it's irrelevant.  I'm not assuming any norm.  Bitcoin, by it's nature, is as secure as cash.  Whether you use it in suboptimal ways is as irrelevant as saying cash is insecure because I left it in my mailbox and someone stole it.

Because it's trivially easy to create a chain that is super long then.

Having your coffee transactions stored with the same security (and cost) as transferring millions of dollars worth of value is a pretty silly assumption.
There are plenty of ways to handle this with more decentralized models, just not exactly like Bitcoin.  Bitcoin will always have slow-ish settle times (extremely fast compared to the current systems, though!), and it's necessary for POW to function.  Quit trying to force a square peg into a round hole.

Speculation does not have to be temporary.


The assumption is that usefulness somehow impacts the price.  It's far more complicated than this.  Plenty of useful technologies don't have a valuable asset.


This is silly, as there is no requirement to hold a cryptocurrency for a long period of time to use it (unless your use is storage).  Just buy what you need immediately before using it and be done with it.


I can see why you made such a foolish investment.  Failing to understand how money works and assuming that it's usefulness somehow automatically equates to value.
For example, if there was a near-zero friction Bitcoin to Ether converter (and no surprise, there are), people could hold Bitcoin if they anticipated it was a better store of value, then convert for Ether when needed.  Ether would be nearly worthless, and Bitcoin would hold all of the value of the system.

Once again, hardcoding a pre-made block would be fucking stupid. Which part of that statement confuses you?
I never suggested making a premade block.  I simply suggested that if their mempool does not reach 1MB, they pad the coinbase to follow their own rules.  Very simple to do and safe.


Not sure who a lot of these are by first name.
Jeff = Garzik?  If so, not skilled or competent in protocol design.
James Hilliard - you mean he patched up shaolin fry's code and put it in?  What is his experience in protocol development.
No idea who the others you refer to by first name only are.  How many commits do they have for bitcoin?


That idea is fucking dumb.
No, you simply create a huge output in your coinbase of 0 value that is full of garbage data if your mempool is too small.  Probably &lt; 10 lines of code to do this.  Which is necessary if you actually want to write a test for this (which begs the question, why is there no test for testing this feature?)


Then it is fucking insane to do it and risk splitting the network.


Miners do not get to change the rules.  Users must change their software to follow them.  Miners mining invalid blocks are as useful at measuring something as looking at miners that are mining ethereum.


I understand the functionality of the code just fine.  I'm yet to see you find a single example of where I haven't.

Yes, if there are no tradeoffs, then it's an easy decision.  The problem is, there are tradeoffs that exist.  Going through an intermediary for trivial purchases while keeping your savings and larger purchases more protected is not a huge trade-off.  Making it harder to run a node without a massive amount of bandwidth and a huge amount of storage dedicated just to running the node is part of a tradeoff.  It's not all roses on either side.

When you loosen the rules, those who follow the tighter rules will follow a different chain.  This is a guaranteed chain split.


I never said they didn't, I said a successful soft fork guarantees no split.


A compatible hard fork without majority hashpower support (now or at any time in the future) gets wiped out.  This is a huge risk for following it.

Just create a transaction that sends it to a 1-of-2 multisig address controlled by Bob and Carol.  Any one of them can then sign the first one, then spend immediately.
This seems rather pointless, as it's basically a 1 of 2 multisig transaction at that point.

Ok, so to have a successful hard fork, you are saying you need 100% support from the community.


You should correct your post to reflect that fact if you value intellectual honesty.

Accepting zero confirm transactions with a high-level of confidence exists only when you can trust miners to act against their own interests.  You are heavily relying on trust, as nothing can realistically and safely give any trustless security to zero-conf transactions.
@_date: 2015-02-13 22:06:05
Because that's the way the defaults are set up, and miners are lazy.
You don't need to offer double-spend as a service, just re-prioritize transactions (e.g. use the patch).
Get arrested?  For what?  How can you even prove which is the "double spend".  Until something is in a block, there is no reason to believe there won't be a different transaction using that input.
Why wouldn't they accept a higher fee transaction over a lower one?  Altruism is the only reason.

I forgot about the 4x cap, good catch.
The trouble with this idea is you actually max out after only 7 quadruplings.  So let's say those blocks were done nearly instantly, you only have 7*2016 blocks of a head start before you are down to 10 minute block times for the rest of the year (unless you start doing something weird with shutting down for a while and starting back - which I don't think would work, but hard to disprove all possible theories).

There are far more important characteristics for money than just being rare.  It needs to be divisible, easy to identify/hard to counterfeit, easily transportable, does not spoil, etc...
Gold's commercial uses are actually fairly limited compared to its supply, and mostly modern.  Fiat money is completely useless (other than maybe wiping your ass or burning), yet has tremendous value.  People hold it because it is something that stores value reasonably well and has other properties of money.


This is more of a requirement for it being money than anything.  And money is more valuable the easier it is to exchange for something.  Chickens would make poor money because you'd need to find someone who actually wants a chicken right then, or else he has to hold the chicken and keep track of it, etc...
Yes, a lot of this is chicken-egg type stuff.  People might not hold Bitcoin unless they feel confident others will want it someday (and they were able to interact with such people).  Speculation is a key catalyst for starting that process.  The fact I can buy some, I don't even really care to use it or not, in the hopes that it will be worth more, actually benefits you even if you just want to use it and never hold.  The more valuable it gets, the more liquid it becomes, and the more you are able to buy with it without moving the market.  Right now, if you wanted to spend $1M in Bitcoin, it would have significant impact in the liquidity.  If Bitcoin had a $1T market cap, it would be a drop in the bucket.  This benefits all users.  Getting mad that someone is getting rich is silly - they actually help you, even if you are upset they don't really want to "use" Bitcoin.

There are plenty of cases of malinvestment in the present, where things are obvious they are fail.  But greed rules very often, especially when cash is cheap.  The whole business cycle theory even shows why it's rational to be greedy like this with cheap money.  This affects a lot.
This has nothing to do with the idea that you have a lot of ideas of which it's hard to tell what will stick, and a few will stick.  There are plenty of techniques now to help fail faster without needing as much capital to waste, though, and you'll see more productive results and the end of the "throw a ton of money at a bunch of crap and hope to hit a bulls eye" style of VC that has dominated the past.
A lot of bubbles are obvious even as they are going on, but you are missing out sitting on the sideline when you can try to get in and get out before the crash.

Hype causes malinvestment.  People dump money into lots of really dumb things that could otherwise have been used for great things.  See all the 2.0 scamcoin/premine bullshit that goes on, and how much money has been lost on that.  Think about how much of that investment would be around in Bitcoin if it just sat tight and did nothing.  They had to pay the bills or their employees/founders had to pay bills, coins are sold that were meant for investment in the new paradigm, and we have a huge downward pressure, far more than even merchant sales.
That's the difference between hype (no substance, just a nice coating) and promotion.
Notice this was geared at startups, but Bitcoin.  Truth is, the vast majority of these startups are going to fail.  They (the vast majority) are run by amateurs, they don't really provide real value, and have an influx of cheap VC capital coming in due to the free money being printed, combined with naive scam-IPO funders that are looking to get something when Bitcoin is down.
A few of these companies are actually semi-decent ideas (although I have no idea if they actually have good business plans, that's another story), like Coinbase/Circle/BitPay/remittance to Philippines, etc... where they are providing a necessary on and off-ramp to Bitcoin.  But I'm failing to see the other startups that are doing anything innovative that will drive that kind of need for infrastructure, thus dooming the models of the above.  I'm sure there are a few, and the good ones are probably stealth, but I haven't been impressed.  It's Pets.com all over again, where people just try to take some old business model, slap Bitcoin on it, and then somehow think it will take them to the moon.

Definitely not convinced that the token is needed, but I at least understand how it works, mostly.  It adds several extra levels of complexity for the possibility of minor benefits that many might not care about, and seems to exist exclusively as a way to fund the project.
No idea why you bring up Warren Buffet, it's completely different.  There's a reason why companies don't float an unlimited of stock in an IPO.  Since you are selling to unsophisticated rubes as those who will fund the project, with a strong fear of missing out element (the escalating price is exactly this).
The problem is there is NO way to value your Factoid investment.  It's complete gambling.  And the number of idiots out there who throw money at completely obvious scams and ponzis means that throwing the promise of a real project behind it will have a decent number of idiots who are just pure gambling on the tokens, thus devaluing anyone who is trying to make an educated investment.
The fact that the details on how the conversion works along with how inflation even works shows no one is even close to knowing what an educated investment is in this.  You might as well just be asking for donations at that point, and inflating through the servers to create the coins.  But, that wouldn't please your master.

Following its own protocol = a horrible idea.  I agree following FrakenSegwit's rule is a horrible idea since it will fork you off the network.


So you need to have a direct connection to miners who will enforce this?  You realize that the miners will reject transactions that are invalid before it activates?


Pretty easy to do this.
Too bad there's virtually no chance miners actually follow the hard fork.  There's no chance they run this code that is unreviewed and seems to only be written by a D-list developer.  It's just a way to save face for miners to activate SegWit before getting UASF'd.  It will die off as quickly as BU and BC after SegWit activates.
@_date: 2016-05-15 21:14:52


You change how the block header is structured.  This has no effect on most of the miners that don't try to make optimizations based on parts not changing.  But ASIC boost miners can't apply their optimization anymore.
As for 21, I don't know enough details, just saw the mailing list, but I'd imagine it would have to do with optimizations on how they iterate over different hashes, that make assumptions about how the header is structured that are different than others.  But I'm only speculating.

Maybe the problem is the mindset is completely backwards - that we should trust people, people who hold hundreds of millions of dollars on our behalf, by default, rather than being skeptical until proven otherwise.  That is Gavin's  problem, he assumes code to be bug-free until proven otherwise, massive changes to the economics of mining to be safe until proven otherwise, rather than the opposite.  This is a lack of security mindset and a reason why Gavin really is out of his league.

There are no workarounds?  You need to look into things more.  There are at least 4 I can think of.  They are only unsatisfactory when you assume the solution must be "the blockchain through direct transactions".  Bitcoin is terrible for many applications.  Let's develop Bitcoin for what it does best, and let augmenting services do the rest.  There is far too much reliance on benevolence of nodes and miners now, and if Bitcoin does take off, things will change anyway.
More fearmongering here from the OMG DO SOMETHING NOW camp.  If Bitcoin becomes unusable in 5 years, there's no reason to think that a hard-fork couldn't be done.  Hell, you could even have a voting system based on who holds coins at some point and only move with 90% approval of voting people.  It's not that complicated.

There were plenty of morons in early.  People saying Bitcoin would hit $5MM (like Falkvinge) or end war (Ver).  A lot of the early interest in Bitcoin was from people who didn't really understand the tech (not many of us did, I know I didn't fully appreciate it even when I bought some in 2011), and simply projected what they really wanted into it.  Hence all the people who thought Bitcoin would be always free and cheap on-chain.

Example of low quality code:
* Garzik not understanding the weight limit and getting bailed out at the last minute after someone pointed it out.
* The mining code not being updated to properly produce valid blocks.
* The completely closed review process (assuming its happening), along with completely ignoring all technical review of proposals.
* The stupid 1MB mandatory block, that could have been solved with a hard fork bit.
* Trying to deploy a hard fork without consensus of the network.
* The signalception of signalling to signal when instead miners could just activate SegWit (or enforce 148, which is far simpler, rather than perform a censorship attack on the network)
While you may have reviewed the code (and I could too), are you qualified to judge the effects of it?  I know I certainly am not- Bitcoin is quite complex and it takes domain experts years to become good enough to know.  Bitcoin Unlimited "looks clean and straightforward" too, yet it had numerous bugs that took it down.  Garzik's entire attitude toward it ("Well, people won't do bad things") shows he is not reviewing things from an adversarial mindset.
If they think they can execute a controversial fork in 3 months without community support, they are insane.  If Bitcoin can be co-opted by a few unprofitable VC-backed companies and the miners, then it is a monstrosity and deserves to die.  It is a useless project at that point.

You realize you need a coincidence of wants for this to occur?
Someone needs to buy with Bitcoins when someone is working wants to be paid in Bitcoins (otherwise you cannot pay out daily).  This works when both happen on the same day (although still is a pain with paperwork, as even the exchange rate changes between time of acceptance and time of paying worker).  You need to deduct their wages through your payroll provider based on what you paid them, still come up with fiat for paying into the employer portion of SS/Medicare (in the US), withholdings, etc...  You need to do this DAILY now instead of bi-weekly or whatever you normally use.
You do this, for the benefit of.... NOTHING.  You add time and labor so that you don't have to use those evil middlemen who charge 0%.  Instead, your employee could just use Bitwage to get wages converted to Bitcoin on their own consistently, at a rate they choose, and you could just use Bitpay or Coinbase if you are so insistent on reducing risk.

Factoids are being generated and distributed to the Factom servers, no?  So whether it's the same one moving around or simply a recycling process is basically the same thing.  If I have to pay Bitcoin to miners to include my transaction, and they are rewarded in Bitcoin for it, it's the same effect, with one less level of indirection.  Of course, it might be at different rates in the Factom case.


I'm missing how this is needed, I thought I could just burn Factoids into entry credits.  If you are just saying someone might hold Factoids so that you can buy entry credits for Bitcoin/pesos/etc... with an extra level of indirection, sure, someone might sell Factoids (basically entry credits that have been immediately converted).  Why can't someone who is in the business of selling entry credits for dollars/Bitcoin/pesos just acquire Factoids whenever a new customer shows up?  I can't imagine the transfer process of Factoid for Bitcoin to be terribly slow.
The servers are holding Factoids because that's how they get paid and need to get rid of them somehow to acquire whatever they find desirable, right?
Am I missing something?

There is exactly no reason to use a blockchain for an autonomous car rental or AirBnB (due, a car and a house is centralized, there is no benefit to decentralizing).  Prediction markets require oracles anyway, which, don't need the complexity of Ethereum.

No, it assumes there is 1MB of transactions in the mempool that will be included.

We are so far from a billion users, we can cross that bridge when we get closer.
Let's work on getting the first million before fucking it up.
Are you suggesting we somehow figure out exactly what cap should be set for eternity?  That's pretty crazy as well.  I'd trust the 1MB cap over that solution, barring something like Justus's proposal to incentivize nodes (which is a great idea, but far too early to rely on right now).
I say we see how much a problem 1MB is now with a smaller ecosystem, we can feel the pain as needed, and make an informed decision rather than get into these religious wars over something we are all speculating on.  If Peter Todd's camp is right, we'll see lots of opportunities for off-chain transactions.  If Gavin's camp is right, we'll see Bitcoin grind to a halt and become more expensive to use, and can justify expansion better.
Odds that Bitcoin ever has 1B users has to be &lt;.1%.  I know people here won't want to hear that, but it's likely true.

@_date: 2015-02-10 18:26:36
These are great ideas, but the key will be how to get it implemented.  I do wonder if it makes sense to build something on top of Bitcoin first as a proof of concept.  Say a smart-contract matching network, where you do "mastercoin-y" like things like bids and asks, but rather than publishing to the blockchain and requiring a scamcoin, you instead have a p2p network with its own mempool of orders and every node tries to match an order to get a cut of the commission (and pays to relay).  This can be done without any changes to Bitcoin, can provide the groundwork for such a p2p platform, work out any problems, without needing anyone on board.  Of course, building a Bitcoin node built on these principles is possible without any core changes as well, but this might be a good starting point.
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:55:14

Valid question.  Hype, by its definition, would mean unsubstantiated value proposition.  I view hype as something that is beyond what it is capable of.

You keep using the word collateral.  
Definition: Collateral is an asset or group of assets that a borrower or guarantor has pledged as security for a loan. The lender has the legal right to seize and sell the asset(s) if the borrower is unable to pay back the loan by the agreed date.
So in masternodes - how does a masternode lose it's collateral?  What can it do to cause collateral to be lost?

I found it, I was somehow searching for Energy Credits instead of Entry Credits (no idea where I got this).  Tell me where I am misunderstanding any of this.
A lot of it is vague, and I'm going to give you guys an honest shot at this, so it's unfair to completely dismiss anything until I really get it.  And to be honest, a lot seems overly convoluted to force a solution into the problem, but let's just give you the benefit of the doubt on this.
Some amount of factoids are presold.  They are worth some value based on trading.  And let's just say, there's some initial value because someone believes they should be worth something.  And that's all that matters, the whole project could fail eventually, but as long as someone believes initially, there's value initially.  And I have no doubts that will be the case.
Entry credits give me entry into the system.  Mechanics aside about how that technically can be done are not important to this.  I can store a record for 1 credit.  I cannot sell entry credits.  Entry credits will be fixed to 1/100th of the cost of a Bitcoin transaction (1/1000th of a tx fee?), at a rate determined by asking a bunch of trusted entities.  So if I can stick a record in the blockchain for 10,000 bits on my own, Factom lets me do it at 1 energy credit.  I can stockpile energy credits if I want, but could never sell them (Airline miles in some sense).  So an energy credit should be worth roughly 1/100th of the tx fee of Bitcoin, with some discount (I'm stuck with them and can't transfer them, so I want a discount to hold them instead of money).  I suppose I could give away my private key to someone, but they'd have no proof that I destroyed my copy of it, so they'd only buy if they planned to immediately burn them all (like buying a Gift Card online).
I get entry credits by burning Factoids.  I got Factoids through a presale or through exchanges, or through inflation.  The conversation rate of Factoids to Entry Credits is floating based on the exchange rate of Factoids to Bitcoins and the Bitcoin tx fee.
Is there anything I have misunderstood or got wrong?

Oh people get involved in things they know will fail all the time, as long as they can pass the buck to someone else.  See the subprime mortgage debacle.  The companies involved were happy to get involved as long as they could pawn it off on someone else.  They'll hold assets they knew were crap because they were hoping they could sell them for more.  This happens all the time.  Hell, there are people who think Bitcoin will fail, but think that they can time things right and buy low and sell high.

Mostly an argument by assuming its own conclusion.
Like any engineering problem, there are trade-offs.  Increasing the block size to infinite has a host of problems and having it arbitrarily small has its own.  There must be a middle ground.  Even if the blockchain should be increased to (20MB/40MB/1GB/etc...) at some point, there actually is some benefit to seeing what actually develops when space in the chain becomes scarce.  Opportunities will arise to work around that limit and really grow things.
I'm not aware of anyone saying that there shouldn't be a limit at all, as there are obvious problems with such an approach.  So let's build around it for now and increase it when it actually is needed and we understand limitations and drawbacks and advantages to effectively decide the tradeoffs.  This is quite dangerous since consensus is so critical.

You are correct I don't get the point of a masternode or why you reward them.

Think of the ownership of Bitcoin as if it were a set of gold bars in different quantities.  The amount of Bitcoin is equal to the "weight" of the bar.
Every time someone sends you Bitcoin, you get a new gold bar, for the amount you needed.
If you need to send someone Bitcoin, you can't just chip off the gold bar and give it to them.  You need to take it to someone who will melt the gold down, and create new gold bars - some for you and some for who you want to send to.  If you have a single gold bar big enough to pay whoever you want, you can just use that.  The goldsmith then melts it down, pours new bars, and gives them to the people who they belong to, and takes a small cut.
Each bar you hold can be used as an input.  Each bar you spend is an output.

The other big thing you need to worry about is of course pricing and chain splits. How do you handle a hard fork? What defines an upgrade vs. a chain split, etc...
I'd love to see a Bitcoin ETF out there, but it's not any kind of conspiracy to say there really are some underlying issues that need to be resolved before such a product could be brought to market.
The whole markets in general are very thinly traded and immature with a lot of fake volume happening on places. I wouldn't envy anyone trying to make an index or ETF, which needs to deal with this kind of stuff.
I'm a lot less likely to believe this is any kind of conspiracy more than just something that regulators really don't know how to deal with because it's something that hasn't been done before and nothing else out there really is comparable.

I didn't say the industry is in decline.  I said it's a stupid investment.  There's a big difference.  Sure, you'll get a few lucky loans that might pay off, but all-in-all, even with USD, your risk level will greatly outpace your returns.
Adding in Bitcoin, where the loans not only need to match the risk level, but also the increasing valuation of Bitcoin, makes it a completely losing proposition.  At least with the fiat based P2P loans, there generally are protections in place and identity verification and ways to collect if the loans go south.  With Bitcoin, you get none of that.  It's all risk and none of the rewards.
So tell me, someone who cannot get a loan otherwise, will somehow have an opportunity where they can pay back above the default/incomplete payback risk rate, AND outmatch Bitcoin's returns?  Color me a bit skeptical.

You can use the SIGHASH_SINGLE option to allow modifications to an unpublished transaction.
In the simplest case, I construct a transaction with a single input and single output (and a small fee).  I can construct the transaction with the SIGHASH_SINGLE option for the input.  This means the signature on that input are valid, as long as the matching output (in the same position) doesn't change.
If I wanted to bump a fee, I could add another input and output to it.  This is less overhead than creating a second transaction like CPFP.

There were healthy returns at Bitcoin Savings and Loan too, but that doesn't mean it was a good investment.


So you loan out 1 BTC at $600, and expect to get paid back 15% interest in USD (say $690).  Bitcoin's price goes up to $700.  You now lost $10, and put yourself out to risk.  You are divesting from Bitcoins in this case, and throwing money down the toilet.

It's a much better assumption that when limitations exist, that solutions will be created to work around them, especially when such solutions are theoretically described today with a great deal of clarity.
You can say you don't want things, but it doesn't really impact usability.  Being able to settle within the blockchain every 17 years isn't a use case.  It's a mechanism for a use case (settling a debt/transferring assets).  Assuming this is the only way to do this is foolish.
There's nothing against Bitcoin's mission that states that you cannot have services built on top of it.  If so, you should rally against pools and force everyone to solo mine.

Not all attacks are equally easy to pull off, nor are all attacks equally as dangerous to pull off.
What can a sybil attack against Bitcoin do, and what is the cost to execute it?  Now compare to Dash.


That's not what collateral means.


Which means the cost is easier to pull off.


Yes, because you don't know what a sybil attack is.  Dash, if I understand correctly, rewards "masternodes".  However, theres no way to know if there is one masternode or thousands, as one large holder could just split his Dash to represent different masternodes.  This means that all it takes is that one node to, without cost, influence the network.  There is no penalty for doing anything wrong, so the masternode that proves ownership of Dash has nothing at stake.


Chances are they didn't use names you recognized.

If you encrypt them, that means that any kind of head injury or death means losing access.
The problem is extremely complicated and a balance between coin theft and coin loss. The tools out there are still pretty poor, especially for the non-technical person. Put it this way, say your grandmother was going to buy 100k of Bitcoin. She barely can operate the remote control. Would you feel more comfortable with her leaving her coins in Xapo or having her attempt to use a ledger and not fuck it up, and store backups. And make sure one of her evil grandkids don't go and break into her safe and steal the funds. Or that when she dies, any password uses will be lost.
We need more people being their own bank, but it's quite hard. Some solutions are coming along like Casa HODL, but those may only be useful for those with 100k or more. For someone who has small amounts and can bear a loss, leaving your keys put might actually be the best thing for them. Everyone is different. There's a reason I don't just keep my cash in a mattress, and instead use a bank for it. Could I build a safe that has enough security to protect my cash? Maybe, but it's just not worth it for the most part.

They are doing custody, so yes, no intention of owning the keys. But this typically is to protect the underlying owner of the asset - they are investing other people's money anyway, and it's not like they are going to have it sent down the portfolio, or make people send it back if the fund manager decides to sell.  They typically have to have things held by licensed custodians for these types of accounts.

@_date: 2013-03-25 20:14:02
If reward drops (either through price drop or costs increase due to difficulty increases), then many miners will stop mining.  If everyone responds perfectly (and everyone is unprofitable), no blocks are mined and the difficulty can never reset.  This is very unlikely, as someone will mine, although it could take a long time.  It also might be that the network becomes so bogged down, only transactions with very high fees get accepted, and the fees might be high enough such that someone becomes profitable again and mines, which eventually resets the difficult.y
Fees only is fine, since difficulty adjusts.  Reward is useful as a bootstrapping technique but not essential to mining long term.
Long term it should be marginally profitable for miners.  If profit is too great, then more will enter, driving difficulty up and lowering  profit.  If it becomes unprofitable, as long as it only happens slowly and different miners have different costs, you will see difficulty decrease or costs decrease (through more efficient miners), which will keep it marginally profitable.
The profits you see for miners now is partially due to the time it takes to get a rig set up, along with the uncertainty that the profit will continue over time.  If it's profitable today but not profitable in a month, you lost your investment.
It's a great system that keeps mining from dominating the economy but provides enough of a reward to keep the system secure.

You can't create new UTXO without miners doing that for you, so I'd say the miners are the goldsmiths.  I'd much prefer they be referred to as melders than miners.  I also hate the term "address" as well, as that seems to signify something you reuse, rather than an invoice number.
The analogy is not perfect - blocks getting orphaned magically restores your gold after it's been melted down, for example, but it's pretty accurate.
Obviously there are more sophisticated parts like only the owner of the gold able to specify how things should be divided/joined, where a goldsmith wouldn't need to follow orders.

The law/credit card agreements actually makes this a pain to do.  He can give a "cash discount".  According to the agreements, he actually cannot even refuse a sale below a certain amount.  If someone tries to buy 10 cents worth of stuff, and the processing fee is $.15, the merchant eats the cost.  CC Companies offering all their protections aren't free, and its passed onto the customers anyway.
For a transaction like this with zero fraud risk is perfect for Bitcoin in its current state.  If Bitcoin grows, we'll see a market where someone has more protections but costs more.

The big assumption is that it will be on power.  You have to look at fixed costs and how they will be part of the recovery.  It may cost $.01/hr to operate a mining rig that generates $1/hr, but still be unprofitable due to having a high fixed startup cost.  A lot of miners look at the marginal costs of producing blocks, but neglect startup costs.  As mining becomes more ASIC-based, you will see fewer power requirements and more up-front costs to be part of the "cost of securing the network".  This is a good thing.

Risk/Reward.  The big cases are different and make a difference.  This is some small useless account to them with little reward for them and big danger.  They aren't going to stick their necks out for him.  They are going to save it for when they actually benefit huge (Libor/HSBC/etc...)
I saw the same thing with online gaming.  The laws are written to make the banks enforce the laws for the government, and the banks freak out about anything that might possibly be gaming related, and it isn't worth the risk.
I am not defending them, just explaining why their actions and why they are rational from the situation.  The situation is far more complicated than you make it out to be, there are many, many interests that sometimes coincide and sometimes are opposed.  After California's idiotic pursuit of Bitcoin Foundation, a bank based in San Francisco is going to try to not piss off the wrong people over some tiny account.  They aren't threatened enough to care about Bitcoin taking them over.
The banks do routinely get slaps on the wrists for minor issues even if the major problems do occur (and typically those are by the bigger players than some small regional bank).  To run a phony system, you need to have the big guys get away with murder but catch the small players for jaywalking, and hit them hard on that.  Then the big players scoop up the remains and move along.  There also is an incentive to avoid trouble unless there are big payouts.  A smart thief will not try to rob a convenience store in broad daylight to get $50.  He will find a way to subtly get a bigger payout with less risk.  This is the same thing.

Someone else sells on Gox and the price goes down (or someone buys on another exchange causing its price to go up relative to Gox).  You have cash on Gox (stuck in Limbo).  Price on Bitstamp is much higher, so you buy Bitcoins on Gox and sell on the other exchange.  This causes the other price to go down.  
Someone buys on Gox driving price up relative to other exchanges (or sells on other exchange driving their price lower).  You have cash on other exchanges.  You sell coins on Gox if premium is high enough, buy on other exchange with reserve funds you have.  Wait a few months and guaranteed profit.

And the price is the collective result of the knowledge out there, combined with risk tolerances, amount available to bet, other opportunities, etc...
There are "incorrect" prices when risk tolerances and amounts available to bet limit things.  Someone with perfect knowledge theoretically could single-handedly set the market at the proper price by continuing to bet for or against it until it was properly priced.  However, he will run out of funds if he is contrary to the collective knowledge, thus we end up with an improper price.
The more participants in a given market, the more parties you have on both sides and more opportunities to take advantage of incorrect prices, so it eventually works out.  But the market is certainly not perfectly efficient.

There are many factors in determing the exchange rate between &lt;Exchange BTC Credit&gt; vs. &lt;BTC&gt; and &lt;Exchange Fiat Credit&gt; vs. &lt;Fiat&gt;, such as risk, insolvency, delays in getting money to or from a site, etc...
You have 4 exchange rates because none are exchanging the same things.

But it wasn't impossible to trade, there was record volume.  That is the opposite of shutting down the exchange.  Shutting things down is more likely to stop the panic than anything else.  Which is why we are seeing it continue to plummet today, even though the other exchanges are functioning normally.
I do agree that Mt. Gox needs to either increase their capacity or place restrictions (order size?) to prioritize bigger trades which take the same amount of capacity as smaller ones, but bring in less value.

The gambling win occurs right away, at the fair market value of the coins.  You can itemize losses.  Each session should be counted as a gain or a loss.  What a session is for something like Satoshi dice is not clear in the law.
In your case, if you buy 10 BTC and gamble it at Satoshi dice right away when Bitcoin is worth $10, you have a gain of 100 * $10 = $1000.  Report that as gambling income.  In a year, say Bitcoin is worth $1000 and you sell.  You have gained 110 * $990 in capital gains.

You basically took something valuable and got junk in return.  You are a modern day Jack who just sold his cow for magic beans.
In any case, besides the obvious flaws with the economic system he is proposing and the scammy nature of collecting Bitcoins and handing out junk in return, I do look forward to seeing JR present on this idea and see if he can actually answer any questions on this, or just wave his hands like everything I've ever seen on Mastercoin.

Decentralization does not resist attacks.  You not only need to make sure every pool operator isn't evil, but those who wish to attack cannot do so.  Pool operators have too much to lose, but an external attacker does not.  Make it hard for external attackers to attack.  If the market drives the most efficient miners to provide more protection, this will make things harder to attack.

The harder it is to find those people, and the more costly it is to meet them, then the less useful they become.  The harder they are to obtain, the fewer people can join that club.  Exchanges are a very low-cost way for anyone to be able to join it.  Instead, we now have a high cover charge (meeting takes time and money and is riskier than wiring money to an established place).  But it sounds like you are a day trader with a longer time horizon.

This can be done right now, but you need someone to rescue the coins for you since the network won't relay the locktime transaction.  Give the lock time'd spending transaction to friends.
Another trouble with this is you don't unlock the address but every input.  So any time you get a new input, you have to create a new locked-time transaction to spend it.

Because they have no other good options for funding PayPal.  People will be more likely to *accept* Bitcoins as payments if they can spend them easily on things.
@_date: 2013-10-17 18:05:14
The problem with that is they need to pay for the mining equipment, which is really expensive.  Someone who is purely interested in currency speculation would have purchased the coins.  Someone who is interested in making a profit from mining without speculating would sell coins to recoup the investment.  Add in that many of the ASICs are paid for with Bitcoins, the creators of the ASICs have expenses that need to be paid in fiat, and that leads to more selling.
That being said, there is a HUGE amount of speculation.  I also think there is room for plenty more speculation to drive things up more.

Here is the best argument against deflation I can think of-
The assumption is people would rather hold Bitcoins than other goods, given its appreciation.  But most people only look at the buyer, without looking at the seller.  Why doesn't the seller who accepts Bitcoins not have this same preference?  Shouldn't be be looking to unload his wares or services at an extreme discount if it means he could acquire Bitcoins?  Trade is a 2-way street.
The answer is obvious why he doesn't do such a thing.  He'd have to give a discount to make up for the preference of Bitcoins to goods.  Say he had to give an 80% discount to get Bitcoins from a customer, where he could get full price for $.  He'd be a fool to accept the Bitcoins at such a discount!  He could instead accept the cash, and buy Bitcoins and get 5x as many of them!  So it's pretty obvious why that doesn't happen.
The same thing in reverse applies to those who have Bitcoins.  They prefer Bitcoins so clearly, so why are they not just stopping all spending and only buying Bitcoins?  For the reasons Erik clearly outlined.
@_date: 2013-10-17 20:05:30
I'm not talking about paying the electricity bill.  I'm talking about paying for the unit yourself.
And if they are so concerned in speculating on currency, they would have just bought Bitcoins and waited for it to rise, since that would be much more profitable.
Then again, most miners are morons, so making a rational choice is not exactly what happens.

Sure, you could say they are speculating on dollars, then.  And most arb traders are going to use a relatively stable currency as a baseline for profits rather than one that routinely doubles and halves its value.
The same could be said over someone arbing stocks or metals or anything else.  They don't care that they might have made more.  They might have lost too.  They aren't in the business of gambling.

Foundation has nothing to do with Satoshi, so not sure why that's relevant.
Satoshi certainly isn't unreachable.  Have you not been paying attention to what has been going on with the NSA spying?  Hell, there are pretty good arguments that Satoshi is already known.
Either contributing to the source code puts a target on your back or it doesn't.  Nothing changed in that area.  Perhaps a slightly bigger one, but Gavin was recognized as a leader and contributor.
Likely this move just shows ignorance and shows they don't even know what they are talking about.  Remember, the government agencies are filled with people about filling up the tubes with too much information.  They are generally not technically savvy.
The foundation may get targeted, and worst case scenario it is disbanded, and we are where we were before the foundation existed.
