And I‘ll take a 10% cut for this advice

Hopefully someday!

Also the customer plays a big role.

Well if you open the bottle you bought it in, it‘s open sauce
@_date: 2018-05-10 08:39:11
No no, I mean 20000 and the rest.
@_date: 2018-05-16 10:53:05
Shame on me! Here you go:

Thank you. I'm not sure I agree that encouraging merchants to accept BTC is equivalent to "I want to get rid of my BTC" (it's more like, "I see value in this commodity that is built to work like the money we are used to but infinitely better, and there is a very good chance that the currency will continue to experience deflation rather than inflation. Why don't you try it out?") but the rest of the article makes a lot of sense. Hoarders increase scarcity, but obviously there has to be buying pressure for the price to increase too. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:56:40
The former
@_date: 2018-08-20 17:36:52
I had exactly the same train of thought as you, so I upvoted your comment too. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 08:19:23
He is. Extremely fun.

If you find one, send it my way 3MZt2ku78kXGTFP99vaPY3yUY7cUqsWzkD

But that‘s two unknowns and only one equation

If you have an internet connection, maybe 1 satoshi
@_date: 2018-05-19 13:06:14
While we're at it, does anybody know of a simple Python script for parsing the blockchain into a file with a list of addresses and balances? 
I've got Bitcoin Core up and running but haven't found anything that I'm able to use on the .blk files. 
Edit: Windows 10 but I've Ubuntu on a VirtualBox with more limited resources. 
Why is this being downvoted?
@_date: 2018-05-10 08:18:16
And the rest

I have a feeling that this post is going to be relevant again tonight
@_date: 2018-05-21 14:02:39
You are welcome

It‘s a Tambo

Ternio claims over 1 million TPS and they‘ve published third party confirmation, though a gut feeling tells me to take that with a pinch of salt, starting with the fact that they‘ve only just started their ICO after a few months of presale and airdrop.  
But the hashgraph protocol is something we should all be keeping an eye on. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:16:41
Well spotted. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 21:00:49
There are decentralised solutions out there that can handle that much and more, and it‘s only a matter of time until the BTC network can handle it too. Ridiculing it won‘t seem so ridiculous in the not-too-distant future. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 21:58:31
Nobody. Go to the address he posted; it‘s still there.
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:03:35
Precisely my thoughts. No problems are solved if they stick to the fees they are known for. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 21:59:51
Sure. That was their third party confirmation, decentralised at least, though probably not a large network. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 13:56:30
Maybe you pay when you order, and only after a couple of confirmations does your pizza go in the oven. 
Will Lightning solve the confirmation problem? 
@_date: 2018-11-03 13:19:09
Probably Room 77
@_date: 2018-03-07 09:07:48
And if it doesn‘t, it certainly won‘t help with decentralisation.

Finally, an app with a functioning widget. UI is sleek and very intuitive. Good work!

You can pay your taxes to me in crypto if you want. PM me for more info

Goos points! Thanks. I‘ve also been sceptical of the public blockchain system and am starting to form the opinion that privacy coins are the way forward.
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:12:14
Isn‘t that just the worst? I hate forgetting to do that.
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:37:14
How do you figure that one out? Gold varies in purity, aesthetics, form and in other ways, while x BTC is and always will be just x BTC.
@_date: 2016-07-11 13:38:52
Am I 18-24 or 24-30 if I'm 24? Otherwise happy to fill it out!
