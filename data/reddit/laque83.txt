I had the same idea last night before heading to sleep.
"This is why two thousand one four won't be like nineteen eighty four"

When I heard the news of tmibile a banking venture I immediately thought of tmobile becoming an American m-pesa.
I also thought about bitcoin as well because m-pesa also does bitcoin.

I don't think this is legit. Usually deal long forms are printed on a hardcopy form impact/laser printed from a DMS (dealer managment system) application and are not done in excel. Additionaly if they would be done electronically they would be from within a webpage which would then be printed out on paper. 
This excel thing seems shady.
Just saying I've worked nearly 10 years in a multifranchise corporate office.

I just got back from Vegas two days ago and yesterday at work I check bitfunder. i I have over 91,000 shares bought between when it was .0005-.0008 (around 3/4 being bought at 0.0008) I am having a hard time keeping my breakfast down this morning as well.....

did you happen to buy your btc from bitstamp?
Also, you should invest your btc into websites like bitfunder.com(virtual btc stock exchange)

I couldn't handle picostocks. As someone who regularlly looks at Command line interfaces quite often that was way more than i could deal with when working with bitcoin. From the look of it 100TH doesn't trade on bitfunder.

I work for a multi franchise car dealership and I have purchased many vehicles in my life and have never seen a finance deal recap look like this. 
I don't think this is legit.

Question: My dev account expired 4 days after ios 7 released. I went ahead and installed ios 7 knowing my sub would expire. Would I still need to have a dev account/udid registered to get updates? I may be intrested as I paid 6.99 pounds(us 11$) to have someone add my udid but never got any confirmation other than paypal's reciept. I've emailed them, but I have gotten no further word, so I've put in a request for a refund from paypal.
Once I find out what the deal is with this other company i'll be sending you a msg to add me

bad/good design or not. 
you don't change a sites appearance without giving the user notice or the ability to toggle the change.
If your bank changes the entire look/feel of a website when you log in without mentioning it even after you've logged in you  would think you might of just been scammed/phished. Coinbase isn't housing my excel spreadsheets it's housing MY currency.
