It has a bug where it will crash after ~50 days, but I will see if I can make an update this week :-)

I've updated the source to sort out the bug where it crashes after ~50 days: 
I've seen no issues fetching the actual data from the API :)

Now wait till CoinSalad figures it out: 
The market likes it:

Some Ruckus APs might run OpenWRT, you could use the original project where I got the idea from: 
Or get a super cheap ESP8266 for a few bucks ;-)
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:20:04
Cool, and thanks!
I really like the error message, I might 'upstream-integrate' that in the future :)
I still need to figure out (most likely one Google search away) how to read/write settings to the ESP8266's memory so I can make changes persistent, and add a hardware reset button on GPIO2 to default settings (it should create a connectable SSID for first time configuration).

Hmm but the radios are the hardware, and OpenWRT the software - right? Anyway good luck! Glad you like it \^_\^

That shouldn't be too hard.
It would require a battery (like one or more 18650 cells), some power converter, charging circuit and the actual solar power.
The ESP-01 version of the ESP8266 (the one in the picture) runs well if it has at least rougly 1 amp of power at 3.3v. I've had one running at 800mA but it sometimes had trouble being stable.
If you [search for]( 3.3v solar projects you can find a lot of information.
Of course it would still need a working WiFi-connection to pull data.

Ah, that's supported!
If you run the installation steps of the Arduino IDE + support for the Nodemcu [here]( you should be able to upload this software into your device.
Just download the .ino file, change the SSID and WiFi password and off you go!

Ahhh thanks for explaining, that makes sense yes. Nice hardware. I only knew the name from their long range products back in the day (pcmcia wifi cards for use in harbors and such).
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:04:32
What type/model do you have?
Is it an [Arduino Uno-like board]( Or an [ESP-01](
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:05:57
I saw your $ fork ;-) maybe I should make it an option in the settings ^_^
I tought about hosting a small webpage on the internal IP that allows you to reconfigure it. Maybe in the next version. :)
Edit: also thanks!
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:47:39
Did some quick Google'ing:
Should work fine!
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:53:33
To be honest thats quite easy to do :-) 
It runs fine on this hardware: 
I'll let you know if I ever decide to do that ^_^
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:48:53
Yes this was the idea - I want to connect the whole device into a wall socket connector. ;-)
The configuration page is fairly simple to do, so is the reset to default option and also writing/reading the EEPROM aparently (see other comment). It's just putting that all together, and having a firmware update mechanism in place (ESP8266 supports OTA updates). Matter of time ;-)

I got the idea from a friend who referenced project: [bitcoin-ssid-ticker: Bitcoin price ticker over wifi SSID names](
However that requires mdk3/OpenWRT and a capable device that is quite a bit more expensive than the super tiny ESP8266.
You can grab a ESP8266 in Arduino UNO compatible form for a few dollars/euros, put this software on it, power it using a phone charger and forget about it.
An example of the wireless signal: [screenshot of my phone](
It is auto-updated every 30 seconds.

Good luck! :)
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:23:29
I might somewhere in the future, but no plans for anytime soon - and hey, it's open source - please go ahead!
