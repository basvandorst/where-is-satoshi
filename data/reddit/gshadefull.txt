The payment processor helps f64 integrate the bitcoin payment on our site. 
You DO NOT NEED to create an account with them. 
When shopping on f64, when checking out, select the bitcoin payment option.  You will be redirected to the payment processor and you just have to scan the qr code.  No other accounts needed. 
Hope this cleared things up :)

You can pay with bitcoin for orders that will be delivered. You just have to choose it first. 
Also, to what email address did you write to?

You are welcome! You do not need to sign up to pay.  Just scan the qr code :)

And they also deliver in the EU, not just Romania.

Also, the option is not hidden, it's in the same list as all other payment options...

Hopefully,  F64 will enable sales across Europe next year :)

Yes I am,  I work at f64, why do you ask?

If you have any more questions, I'll be happy to answer...

It says right in this blog post :) 
"Bitcoinul poate fi folosit pentru cumpărături pe F64.ro, întrucât tocmai ce am introdus și această modalitate de plată."
Bitcoin can be used to make purchases on f64.ro, as we have just introduced it as a payment option.

Thanks for pointing that out, it is an old banner, it will be replaced

The best part about the bitcoin launch was that the GPeC Summit was sponsored by Visa and MasterCard. 
They were thanked by btcxchange.ro's CEO for the opportunity to present Bitcoin.

I am new in the bitcoin world and I can say it it was easy to install a wallet on my phone, secure it and get some bits at my local exchange. 
And last week I introduced my 40yo coworker and gave him some bits on the spot.
I hope everybody starts using it, even the homeless.

you have to add your products, select the delivery (second one) and then you will be able to select a payment method, it's the last one.
Hope this helps

I stand corrected, they already do ship in the EU.

I'll tip my hat for that.

If it's a chain,  then the units are links in that chain. Bit links :)
