You can still make money when the bitcoin price is falling. You trade your bitcoin with a short booster on the Coinarch bitcoin trading site. I had a feeling it was going to fall and have made money. It's awesome

Maximiser offers them the chance to earn up to 50% interest, while also buying bitcoins along the way if the price drops.
Customers investing in the Maximiser set an maturity date for their investment. They also agree to purchase bitcoins at a discount to the market price, known as the ‘strike’, when the investment matures.
The Maximiser then calculates a cash settlement price, which is the original amount invested plus a predetermined interest rate based on the maturity date and the strike.
If the bitcoin price is below the strike when the Maximiser matures, the customer must buy the bitcoins at the strike price. If it finishes higher, they receive the cash settlement.
The Maximiser arrangement exposes the customer to losses should the bitcoin price drop substantially by the Maximiser’s maturity date, but it also gives them a healthy return on their investment should the market stay relatively static.

If I want to profit from bitcoins do you think I should buy now or wait and then sell them. Does anyone know any good trading sites where I can leverage .
