Looking back at the last 30 days we've had two rallies attempt to push and hold the 13k barrier and fail, bears pull us back to 10k, and correct back to somewhere in the middle. I've been hodling, but this time if I see the same trend start to form that we've already seen I'm going to sell on the other side of the 13k peak, somewhere around 12.8k. If I'm right, I'll be able to buy back in at around 10k and get a bit more BTC for my money.
If I'm wrong and it's a bear trap that bucks the trend, that's fine, I'm in for less than $500, it's not a huge loss to buy back in at a slightly higher price and miss some profit.
I'm just running an experiment basically. For the long term, it's probably more profitable to hodl.

Fiat atms are just touchscreen fiatbases.
If you wanna be pedantic, anything can be anything.

I'm not trying be be defeatist here, I think it's possible within the next 100-200 years, but getting rid of money is a huge ask. An interim step would likely be one where we return to a barter economy for luxury goods and services, such that everybody helps each other with their own specialized knowledge. But to even get there we need to move to 100% renewable energy and solve world hunger. Not to mention completely remold the social construct of working for a paycheck, ownership of goods, social classes, it goes on and on.
It could happen, some day.

Not really, no? Sure, a post-scarcity Utopia where nobody has to pay for anything would be ideal, but if you go outside and look around you, do you really think we're going to achieve that in our lifetimes?

Isn't that the entire point of a stop loss? To avoid 'showing your hand', and putting pressure on the market in one direction or another, so to speak?
Are some people actually able to view my stop losses on GDAX?

Even if there was a minimum deposit, you could easily get around it by buying through ACH transfer on regular Coinbase, then transferring to Coinbase Pro with zero fees. Your login is the same between both services. That's how I did it when I decided to make the switch.

And when you deposit money in an atm, at least to a checking account, it goes into a huge pool with all the other checking accounts, where the bank does trading on derivatives and bonds to make a profit. Kinda like exchanges buying low and selling high on your BTC. As long as they have the BTC (or Fiat) to pay out at time of asking, the banks won't crash.

As much as I and everybody here would love to see that happen, please don't trust the words of somebody that stands to directly profit off of increased hype, that's dangerous.

Nice! I know I had a wallet on one of my HDDs at one point, but I don't know which wallet software, any of the information for it, and which HDD out of the 6 installed on my computer lol

How do I buy BTC without causing the next dip?
How do I sell BTC without causing the next rally?
I'm a fucking market magician and I never signed up for this.

Ew Chrome-only browser extension.
Oh well looks like you can use it without the extension maybe, I'll try it out.

Mining will stop when it stops becoming profitable, I.E. when the electricity cost to mine BTC outweights the profit of shared pool mining.
The 2028 halfing might be enough to do that for most people, assuming BTC isn't a 6-digit commodity by then.

Sold at 10.6. 
I've resigned myself to the fact that I cannot predict this market in any way. First time the price dipped under the EMA26 on the 5 day chart since July 30th, and right after a double peak at 10.9. All the signs pointed towards a dip. Nope, right back up to 11k.
Part of me wants to pull out and invest in something I have a chance of being able to explain to my family as being something other than just gambling. The other part wants to just join the cult and hodl to the moon.

We show that it is virtually impossible for an individual to day trade for a living, contrary to what course providers claim. We observe all individuals who began to day trade between 2013 and 2015 in the Brazilian equity futures market
Glad I'm not futures trading in Brazil then.
