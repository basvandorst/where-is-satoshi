no worries, I'm writing now some ideas together &amp; will share them later

if they really are the biggest online poker destination then this is really big news!

apparently Armory has this feature at least through the console. I haven't tried it though. Here's the link 
Has anyone else tried this?

once you start caring if you'd lose your bitcoins you should from then on always use cold storage for the majority of your bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-03-07 22:48:09
wow did the fee just go down from 1.5% to 0.5%?
@_date: 2013-03-10 02:26:37
very classy!

on the wiki it says you accept donations, does that mean only donations or you take bitcoin payments for dental services as well?

Can torchat send offline messages? never used either but very interested in them.
What about voice chat?

I agree, I'm also right now more worried about loosing my offline private key(s) as opposed to having it/them stolen. Luckily, SSSS is a great solution for both. I prefer  to  because PassGuardian uses an easily accessible open-source source code at github that you can backup and use even if the website disappears or build on top of it. It also has a SHA3-512 hash and I think the other one does not. And you can run the PassGuardian website offline as well. Load it in any web browser in incognito mode, disconnect from the internet, and do your thing. Of course the safest would be to save the github source code to a USB, transfer it to an always offline computer, and generate your backup codes there.

yup, what's maybe best according to the government (let's not argue about if they are right) might be far from being best for a small city. generating wealth locally and encouraging to keep it local and greatly benefit a local economy, especially when it comes to fundamental goods such as food and vital services.
@_date: 2013-03-09 14:27:54
the idea is to encourage the local economy and not get sucked dry by the near by capital city

could someone help me with setting this up in my own spreadsheet ... it says in the instructions to add some functions to the Gspreadsheet query wrapper ... where is that?
@_date: 2013-03-08 01:44:36
i like it but the main page needs to be even more clear and focused
@_date: 2013-03-10 02:31:29
i said similar and i also mentioned other examples
@_date: 2013-03-16 03:30:23
Looks suspicious ... Hard to believe the person's life turned around like that in a month, from no money &amp; no food to paying a couple of thousand dollars worth of bitcoins for a funeral 
@_date: 2013-03-10 02:24:19
the idea is similar to coupons, collecting miles, or Amazon coins and they seem to work
@_date: 2013-03-09 14:29:15
keep me posted!
@_date: 2013-03-04 04:53:15
just to correct you about the "number of atoms in the universe."
"Two approximate calculations give the number of atoms in the observable universe to be close to 10^80."
@_date: 2013-03-08 10:18:15
added both to the wiki

I hope you don't think I'm the dentist unless you want me to use a hammer :P 
I was putting a list together with all the services I use and need &amp; was wondering if it would be possible to get them all via bitcoin payments. 
I just saw this dentist on the [bitcoin.in trade]( page under dental services. I guess you should be listed there as well. Now we have a choice of two :)
@_date: 2013-03-04 04:59:09
with 512bits it would nicely out do the number of atoms of the universe
@_date: 2013-03-10 02:22:20
Do you think coupons, ways to collect miles, Amazon coins, and others don't encourage people to stay within their predefined ecosystems? In many ways the idea of local money is the same, to restrict it's use for local goods and services within a predefined geographic area.
@_date: 2013-03-09 21:35:24
I understand too little of cryptography to be sure they have ... I sent a message to the bitlogs author &amp; hope to get an answer.
@_date: 2013-03-07 20:59:32
revised list:
* trust (sum total of all the features below)
* value (storage of expended energy)
* decentralized (no central authority)
* costs (low maintenance expenses)
* transparency (of the overall currency system)
* privacy (for users)
* security (difficult to counterfeit &amp; steal)
* mobility (easily transferable, speed)
* durability (resistant to wear &amp; tear)
* fungibility (divisibility)
* scarcity (limited amount)
* recognizability (easy to identify)
* liquidity (wide user acceptance)

seems like a fake, can't find that on twitter ... Anyone got a link to that tweet?
@_date: 2013-03-07 17:29:42
oh man thanks for both of those ... totally for got about them
@_date: 2013-02-28 23:17:58
found it. here are the two links needed:

What would be best practice for those trying to plan ahead in case of death or an accident that results in brain damage?

If it's released with a back door then you can forget it! But if otherwise their ideas are sound we could see the open source community pick it up and create a backdoorless version.
@_date: 2013-03-03 20:57:49
I would go one step further &amp; say you should not use a simple paper wallet &amp; opt for applying Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme to your important private keys 
@_date: 2013-03-09 14:42:54
thanks! this might be the best solution yet for a special purpose currency, to build it on top of bitcoin
@_date: 2013-03-07 20:51:14
i missed that
@_date: 2013-03-09 21:11:07
version 1.0 cryptography was reported as broken  
has that been addressed/changed yet?
@_date: 2013-03-08 16:40:42
don't forget to add yourself to the wiki and other listings
@_date: 2013-03-15 20:24:06
omg lets abandon all currencies because child pornographers have used them in the past &amp; present ... ridiculous
@_date: 2013-03-10 06:48:39
which Shamir's secret sharing tool/website would you use to split the private key(s)?
I know of these two:
@_date: 2013-03-08 01:47:13
ah just that blockchain was asking for feedback about their service and I said I like the idea and might use it in the future when I need it but if they lowered the fee to 0.5% I would use it more frequently &amp; here we have it :)
@_date: 2013-03-09 03:33:47
I meant the adoption by an area/city as the local currency with the support of the community and the local city council. So adoption wouldn't be the problem. I was hoping to find some examples and learn from them.

no way, people in general are not that foresightful. plus many restaurants will always try to sell you desert and then coffee to make the extra profit. how would they do that if you had to know ahead what you will pay for?
@_date: 2013-03-04 05:18:15
is there any implementation of this in a software or web based wallet?
@_date: 2013-03-08 00:10:38
so they listened to the feedback I and others gave over at bitcointalk
