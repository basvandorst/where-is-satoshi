 is a good alternative if you are looking for local places accepting bitcoin
@_date: 2014-02-04 06:36:07
Exactly. For Bitcoin, all the market cap tells is how much someone would have to pay if they bought every single coin in existence right now at a particular price.
A better way to show the "economics" of Bitcoin would be to use such a metric as [transactions per day]( or [transactions per day excluding popular addresses]( These numbers represent actual transactions rather than the number of coins in existence multiplied by an arbitrary "value" for each and every one of these coins.

I've been saying this a lot at our local meetup, the network is more than just the Bitcoin protocol. 
The network of people that has been built on top of Bitcoin is why it will succeed.

It is great to hear how supportive reddit admins are of Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:10:57
This exactly. As unintuitive as it sounds, see if there is a local meetup near you where you can meet once a week to discuss. That way, you get your fill without spending too much time.

I wouldnt use BitJam. I tried it, but lost all my money first loan in. It isn't worth it. You are likely to gain more by just holding your btc than the risk of it disappearing.
@_date: 2013-04-02 05:22:04
So use a different wallet. Electrum is a very easy wallet to understand.

Just bought the bundle, twice. Once for myself and once for a friend. Another plus to this is that I got to introduce my friend to bitcoin! 
Use opportunities like this where someone has a product your friends may actually want to introduce them to bitcoin.

Your blockchain.info stats are only for wallets provided by blockchain. Their service is called "my wallet". This isn't the only wallet service, so the number is likely much larger.
Also, the whole point of Bitcoin is anonymity, and having "wallets" being able to be tracked rather than Addresses would severely compromise the system. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:30:47
The great thing about massive fees is that it will not be a big deal later on. Speed is better lately because of how fast BTC raises in price. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 20:56:59
you can use multiple wallets for multiple identies. Also use another address for each incoming transaction. You can only follow addresses in the blockchain, not wallets. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:29:58
Whats the difference between a restaurant trusting that your bitcoins will actually arrive in their wallet (ie. not double spend) and trusting that your $20 usd is real?
Either way, the risk is there.
@_date: 2013-03-04 12:25:01
Now, I must ask... Whats 
@_date: 2013-03-06 05:00:59
Yes, however I'm sure many of these are people who are re-betting the "same" coins. It would be an interesting feature if someone created an application that, instead of following the transactions that addresses do, follow the bitcoins themselves, similar to the "tree" usage of blockchain.info, but for a larger part of the network rather than just 1 transaction.

If it is only a small amount of USD you need to exchange, consider  as the price difference wont be very much over the small amount [and in the time it takes to get a dwolla account and exchange, BTC may have raised in price enough to offset the difference! :) ]

lol yeah, and BitcoinTip is fairly new too! 
Hopefully that helps. I love when developers give a TL;DR

He did, just by way through me he encountered bitcoins. I had Bitcoin on hand already and decided to use them for this transaction to prevent paypal from taking obnoxious transaction fees from the developers. They are already giving us a fantastic deal on great games, why should we deny them more?

Well that one worked lol. Thanks!
Perhaps it has something to do with flip? 
@_date: 2013-02-25 21:55:43
I'm wondering the other way... Will there be enough of a sellout at one point to push the market back down? I agree, Bitcoins will continue to sell high consistently, but will the market push the value back down temporarily?
@_date: 2013-03-29 04:45:39

They use the sprint network for when you are out of wifi zone, which covers a large area these days. 
The only downside is that you drop calls when you leave a wifi zone and talking at the same time. It automatically re-dials, but is still an inconvenience.
@_date: 2013-03-08 03:14:02
simplest perhaps, but not the most efficient or useful. If you need an all in 1 client that pretty much sets it up for you, check out bitminter.com
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:10:24
And this is only a soft limit. Given a fork, we can easily make BTC more separable. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:41:01
Yeah, but the money you save may be worth it to you?
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:37:00
That means that they are in that address. Any error is on Strongcoin's side, as the bitcoins are still in the wallet
@_date: 2013-02-26 23:35:24
My guess is the 30 is a typo... 30K maybe?
@_date: 2013-03-29 04:19:38
You have to have bitcoin tips at the beginning of a new line. Either start with it at the beginning of the comment or start a new line before saying it.
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:07:06
yes, that would be a potential goal of such a strategy.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:50:46
Well, I'm sure there are people in the US who will do it for you, but that would be extra time +money for shipping
@_date: 2013-10-02 03:57:45
If I remember right, its is when blockchain.info receives the block, which means the time that is listed can be different than the time it was mined.
@_date: 2013-04-01 21:20:50
This isn't too bad for just a GPU if you arn't paying for electricity or don't have easy access to an exchange. I wouldn't use your CPU to mine though, as it provides little extra "speed", costs more electricity, and wears on your system.
TL:DR Not bad for 1 GPU, stop mining with CPU
@_date: 2013-03-26 18:08:01
The better question is, why does this matter? Bitcoins are infinitely divisible, so as soon as half is gone, we can change how much we charge for goods. That is the beauty of the system.
@_date: 2013-03-29 04:31:33
it should... as you see in their simple guide  there are some examples where it is not in the first line.

That is because your client sent the transactions to both chains, and while some got mined on the on the one chain, they eventually got mined on the other also, as the one chain didn't recognize the other. 
In a situation that OP suggests, we would have 2 "valid" block chains because both groups want them to work. 
To update after such a crisis, the Bitcoin community would need to decide on one chain to follow, and then update all the transactions that was processed by the forked Blockchain. This would increase in feasibility and block size as time increases and transactions pile up on both sides.

Market will always determine the dificulty. When the reward halves we may see lots drop out of the network to the point where it is profitable for them.  The combined network could be less than the difficulty but that just means slow blocks for 2 weeks until the dificulty changes to match the new total hashing pool.
@_date: 2013-02-27 00:29:53
That is likely one of the best ways to introduce new people to Bitcoin. Find slightly related subreddits and X-post to them.
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:31:05
sounds like a good addition to the Bitcoin community!
@_date: 2013-02-22 01:03:34
My question is, are you going to have a direct bitcoin adress format (like satoshi dice) or are you going to use "points" or such that players can buy? Perhaps having the option of both would be nice to limit transaction fees for the players?
@_date: 2013-03-29 04:43:04
You likely have more than one address in your wallet. Its no big deal, most wallet software automates when you spend BTC to have some come back to a "change" address. This is likely the case with your situation.
@_date: 2013-03-26 20:50:41
and then, amazingly, the market will level out. Someone has to be willing to buy the bitcoins for the holders to sell them, and those buyers will continue the market as normal.
@_date: 2013-03-29 19:48:16
One potential reason is to try to scare some people. If a large amount of money is spent, some people will try to sell off because they think the market will crash soon. This allows the original person selling to buy back the more bitcoins with the same amount of money. 
Imagine you had bought 10,000 BTC @ $90 USD. Selling it all could reduce the price by ~ $10, giving you ~$85,000. If the market then re-stabilizes at the new $80 USD/BTC, you could buy 1062.5 BTC.

Difficulty - use their link or 
BTC per Block - keep at 25, as this will not change for a while
Conversion rate - The biggest exchange is MTGOX.com, or use  to find the most recent rate. 
Hash Rate - use the advertised hash rate with your asic system, or from this list 
Electricity rate - ask your electricity provider, or use default
Power Consumption - again use value from asic provider or   
Time Frame - However long you expect to mine
Cost of Hardware - your cost for your asic/rig or to get a good estimate,  
profitability decline per year - this is from increasing difficulty due to more hashes joining the entire mining pool
@_date: 2013-03-26 03:04:32
Why does everyone say that there wont be a good ROI... Any bitcoins you mine are not worth what the price is when you mine it, they are worth what the price will be when you exchange it. Mining with an ASIC is similar to buying X amount of coins each day (when mining with a pool). If you sell all those at $1000 even if it is worth only $100 when they are mined, you are still making money.
