More are getting fed up, sure, but so many are still of the opinion that people that object to the government are automatically bad and the government is automatically good. Still more believe anything and everything they're told by the talking heads on Fox, CNN, and the like.
It will literally be people starving to death that causes them to actually *do* anything about this. For so many people, all the things they hear about the 'big bad government' are just BS sprouted from the mouths of batshit crazy conspiracy theorists.

Before I had to underclock the memory on my Radeon HD 5970, I was getting about 650 MHash/sec. Since I've had to downclock the memory due to artifacting issues in games, I get about 550 MHash/sec. I use slush's pool, and have mined about 14 bitcoins since starting a couple of months ago.

I'm personally saving the ones that I mine. My PC needs an upgrade and, as far as I can tell, BitcoinStore is just as good of a place as any to buy parts.

This is just my personal experience, but a few months ago, I saw mining bitcoins as, "Oh hey, I can get cash for these!". Yesterday, I bought a $180 SSD for my PC with .98 bitcoins. So yeah, I'd say that's a pretty damn big increase in utility. For me, anyway.

I did my part yesterday! Got myself a brand new SSD for .98 BTC.
