whats ur country?
@_date: 2015-06-12 09:54:14
that would be awesome!! but let's wait a few days.. some bitcoin resources are still unavailable in russia. And how they re going to regulate transactions in bitcoin??
@_date: 2015-12-03 11:17:46
did u try 247exchange.com? and where r u from?
@_date: 2015-06-13 07:14:52
prepaid credit card?? havent heard of such,to be honest. if you mean prepaid debit card,i'm afraid, there are no trusted exchanges accepting cards without verifying a client..
@_date: 2015-12-03 11:13:30
personally i use  to buy btc with my MC debit card, all goes smoothly, bought many times there.And it is instant
@_date: 2015-12-03 11:15:32
i'm afraid it's not possible to buy btc anonymously with a card.. it's too risky for services to accept cards without identification
@_date: 2014-12-29 08:58:18
it's impossible, serious exchanges want your personal info to prevent themselfes from risks
@_date: 2014-12-29 09:09:10
promising, gonna add it to my bookmarks
@_date: 2015-05-16 05:23:21
great news!! lets wait for the new decisions)
@_date: 2015-05-30 06:34:05
u can find a list of exchanges accepting cc here: 
@_date: 2015-05-22 09:05:30
bitcoin exchange account isnt needed for that if u use fixed rate exchanger
@_date: 2015-05-16 05:27:35
i guess it depends on what type of servie u r charging..
@_date: 2015-05-16 05:24:08
maybe the judges have been paid by bitcoin?)) and nobody can prove it)
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:30:25
my friends from Russia say that bitcoin.org works smoothly these days, without any limitations. it even shows russian version of site
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:20:24
these are only plans, but that would be crazy! however i'm pretty sure they will not do this
@_date: 2015-01-23 07:10:53
finally! i was worried enough,had some pending deals with forum members there
@_date: 2015-05-16 05:30:54
why cant you just withdraw your btc to your Visa or MC debit card everytime you need to make any purchase??
@_date: 2015-01-13 09:41:28
used 247exchange once, bought 1 btc with sepa, all went smart.. though have not tried my card there yet
@_date: 2015-01-23 07:08:24
my friends from russia complained they cant access bitcoin wiki en.bitcoin.it for a week already..
@_date: 2016-03-31 04:06:05
i use [247exchange]( for withdrawing btc to my bank account. Used both swift and sepa.. Last time i sold 20 btc to them and received sepa in just 2 days. their fee was only 0.25%
@_date: 2015-01-15 08:55:55
seems like it depends on internet provider. but these friends of mine are even from different cities, bitcoin.org works perfectly for both of them
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:26:54
looks nice! gonna try it..
@_date: 2015-01-17 05:43:00
plenty of trusted exchanges listed here 
@_date: 2015-05-16 05:16:57
it depends on where you live.. where are u from?
@_date: 2016-01-28 05:14:59
check this list: 
@_date: 2015-08-05 13:08:39
i tried a few exchanges from the list and it was ok.. Never heard of Bitin.co though and i dont see it in this list
@_date: 2015-07-30 08:15:54
check this list: 
@_date: 2016-02-20 05:17:21
but looks like bitcoin might be banned in Russia soon..
@_date: 2016-02-20 05:21:31
you can try  - they accept sepa as well. Bought bitoins with my credit card many times there and it was ok. They have verification, but it was not annoying for me,it was rather quick
@_date: 2016-02-19 12:56:41
my choice is  made many exchanges with them, mostly buying btc with my credit card which is instant. All good, i like 247 for its speed
@_date: 2016-02-17 05:50:19
haha.. no limits.. thats not possible,buddy, but whats your country??
@_date: 2015-04-24 10:55:29
imho it's much more simpler just to trade bitcoin with your common credit or debit card which u use for other purchases then to order a special debit card
@_date: 2015-09-22 10:05:14
i wouldnt advise u to pay to these guys,but if you wish to,maybe this list of sites will be helpful for u: 
@_date: 2015-04-09 13:12:07
not likely. havent heard of such ones. exchanges accepting cc always have a huge verification
@_date: 2015-09-18 05:25:29
"I have a small amount of bitcoins" - how many bitcoins Gref has, i wonder? ))
@_date: 2015-09-26 06:08:30
strange.. few months ago they said they were going to regulate bitcoin, but not forbid it..
@_date: 2015-04-11 10:18:23
that really sux since i'm spending some time in Russia(( and i can't understand rus government's logic..
@_date: 2015-04-21 13:32:35
xbt seems more official and btc seems more simple.. newcommers may not even know what is xbt..
@_date: 2015-09-17 12:03:50
whats ur country?
@_date: 2015-09-05 13:43:30
i guess the best way to pay for such small amount is creditcard.Maybe this exchanges list will be helpful for u.. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 08:16:35
247exchange.com accepts credit cards,it's instant, but after verification. They also accept instant money transfers,not sure about WU though
@_date: 2015-04-29 08:13:51
havent heard of any,all trusted exchanges accepting cc have necessary ID and other verification!!
@_date: 2015-03-15 11:02:30
where are you from?
@_date: 2015-03-20 15:58:24
where r u located?
@_date: 2015-02-05 07:12:09
anyway seems like bitcoin is almost banned in russia..
@_date: 2016-05-11 04:56:10
whats your country?
@_date: 2015-02-20 11:23:01
exchanges always put high % for card to btc operations because there is risk of chargeback, fraud and scam in this case.  So i'm afraid you cant buy btc at the market rate using your card. Btw here is the list of trusted exchanges for purchasing btc with card: 
@_date: 2015-02-05 13:28:17
i guess your government is busy solving more serious problems.. That's why
@_date: 2015-02-26 08:15:14


i bet there is no exchangers who accept credit cards without verification, it's too risky, they are not kamikazes,you know
@_date: 2015-02-18 12:08:08
i guess, floating rate is the reason. they are not sure how much btc will cost tomorrow
@_date: 2015-02-03 04:34:57
congratulations! life can be easy with bitcoin
