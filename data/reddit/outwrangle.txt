People don't want (or need) to carry around *more* things in their pockets.
Instead, we should be able to use a smartphone app. I go to a store that accepts bitcoins, they ring up my purchases, and I send them the appropriate amount of bitcoins from my phone to their server. Then their server sends a receipt to my phone confirming that the transaction is complete, and I am on my way. 
This would be good for P2P transactions as well, because the phones could exchange bitcoins and receipts with each other. I could see this being used in illegal activity, but I guess there could be protection measures for that sort of thing.
Also, in case you get mugged, you should be able to deactivate the app from any internet accessible computer.

Right below GOOOH, which is also kind of cool I guess.

It's showing up for some people and not for others.
No one is quite sure what is going on.
... by any chance, you do live outside the US?

Why is your website so narrow? You have a whole computer screen - use it!
Also, make use of [this handy tool.](

DirecTV does on their *Free Speech TV* network.

Tell that to the 27 million people that listen to NPR.

I know that. 
My point is that it will quickly become illegal if that practice becomes widespread. There *needs* to be measures in place to prevent that from happening, or else the government will step in. All it takes is one politician with an agenda to say "Bitcoin is corrupting your children" to kill Bitcoin, and perhaps even kill the concept of P2P currency entirely.
Also, I don't want to have a wallet either. As things go more an more digital, we are on the verge of being able to combine our wallet and our smartphone into one device. Won't be long until we have driver's licence apps and insurance card apps for our phones.

And the system caught on and stopped it.

You can also make any comparison look bad *if you ignore any case where you make the comparison look good.* It swings both ways, bro.

r/bitcoin was an inside job!

LulzSec has a pretty huge botnet.
I wonder if they have any plans like this.

Goooh seems awfully popular, yet I never really hear about it on Reddit.
There isn't even a subreddit. How odd.
