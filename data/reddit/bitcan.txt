It was just a comment regarding the proposed pyramid structure really. Money can flow in and out of bitcoin so there's no real hierarchical structure as such.
It's flowing in currently but it can easily go the other way.
I agree it's unlikely that any crypto is going to unseat any of the large stable currencies.
It might take the place of some smaller unstable or hyper-inflationary ones.
Even with taxes enforcing the use of a currency as law, many countries operate in practice with several currencies, accepting the dollar or euro alongside their own currency. It's not impossible to imagine a crypto might also complement these.
I agree that no one is forcing anyone to use bitcoin. It will only be if it's easier or cheaper or some other advantage.
It could well be another crypto is the first choice.
Or bitcoin could be improved to be the best. Additional second layer and side chain enhancements may mean that bitcoin is just the final "base layer."
The network effect of bitcoin having the largest user base and mind share may mean that it is the ultimate settlement. People will go where the people are, in the same way that someone could have built a better or cheaper eBay in the past twenty years but the network effect makes an incumbent difficult to remove.
The environmental angle is an interesting point to consider. There's the argument about the vast infrastructure required for traditional banking, or the fact that most miners are set up near hydro electric power which is plentiful. (Seems like Iceland would be a good candidate for mining, with their geothermal energy.)
It's also debatable whether other coins would take precedence because they are more environmentally friendly. It may be that bitcoin is less efficient but ultimately still more profitable because of the price.

I agree with you.
If bitcoin is to become a viable solution for a large proportion of the world's population we need to acknowledge what a colossal goal that is.
Bitcoin isn't in the same phase of its growth as when it was solely the preserve of a few enthusiasts.
We need to get the right solutions in place, which will take time and will constantly evolve anyway.
There's a section in "The Internet of Money" about how the early internet struggled to cope with Usenet, then it struggled with email, then with attachments and so on.
Soon it will struggle with streaming 8k VR or whatever.
That hasn't diminished it's constant increase in value.
The world isn't currently struggling to buy coffee.

Just think of it as currency trading. People have always bought and sold pairs of currencies. This is no different. 
The price is just set by supply and demand, not directly by any policy.
A traditional currency is often bought with a view to the current or future healthiness of a nation's economy.
As a world currency, the price of bitcoin is probably a result of people's current desire to use it to purchase goods or services.
Or an expectation that they will do so in the future. The expectation is that there will be a lot more users than bitcoin, so the price will increase.

Mastering bitcoin is excellent so I recommend understanding that as much as possible.
Other than that, you can get white papers for bitcoin, lightning etc as free PDFs
Coursera has crypto related courses.
This is really good:
