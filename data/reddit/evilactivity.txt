6 HOURS AGO 101
The world’s largest banks are pushing back on the introduction of bitcoin futures, raising concerns with US regulators that the financial system is ill-prepared for the launch of the contracts as the value of the volatile cryptocurrency has soared.
 
The price of bitcoin has risen to a new high of more than $15,000 on several exchanges. Institutional investors have been keen to trade the asset but only via a regulated market.
 
However, the planned launch in the next 10 days of futures contracts by the Chicago exchanges CME Group and CBOE Global Markets, given a green light from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week, has prompted a backlash among the major brokers who backstop trading across the industry.
 
According to a letter from the Futures Industry Association, the main futures industry lobby group whose members include all the largest Wall Street banks, to the CFTC, the rapid introduction of bitcoin futures “did not allow for proper public transparency and input”.
 
The lobby group represents some of the world’s largest brokers, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Citigroup.
 
The CME and CBOE agreed to operate under a self-certified regime for their upcoming contracts, meaning regulators had minimal time to review them formally.
 
The letter, sent to the CFTC on Thursday, insists that using a self-certification scheme for “these novel products does not align with the potential risks that underlie their trading and should be reviewed”.
 
The CFTC warned last week during its approval process that the emerging cryptocurrency markets were largely unregulated and the agency had “limited statutory authority”.
 
“It is also our understanding that not all risk committees of the relevant exchanges were consulted before the certification to launch these products,” the letter added.
 
Futures brokers are worried they will bear the brunt of the risk associated with bitcoin futures, because the margin that backstops the contract is placed in a clearing house.
 
Clearing houses stand between two parties in a trade, managing the risk to the rest of the market if one side should default. They are mutually funded in part by banks to guard against the failure of their largest members.
 
Several brokers among the top 10 largest providers have privately confirmed to the Financial Times that they will not clear the products immediately.
 
ABN Amro told clients it would clear bitcoin futures but only if they submitted requests in writing, and said it would assess the customer’s trading systems and track record in meeting risk limits. “Other factors may be considered [by ABN] in its sole and absolute discretion,” it said in a notice.
 
CBOE said its futures exchange did not have a risk committee, but it consulted with its board and regulatory oversight committee. The OCC, its clearing house, also has a risk committee that reviewed the product.
 
In its filing, CME said it had discussed the specifications of the contracts with customers for around six months. It did not have an immediate comment on Wednesday.

One clearing broker said that it would be open-minded about cryptocurrencies, as they were US dollar products, but only if they were “properly controlled and regulated”. However he added: “We’d still be on the hook in a worst-case scenario as we are exposed as members of the clearing house.”
 
Bob Fitzsimmons, head of Wedbush Futures, a non-bank broker, said his company would back both the CBOE and CME products from day one. “We could sit for hours and have a philosophical debate about bitcoin and its legitimacy and uses, but our job is to service our customers,” he said.
 
Other exchanges are showing interest in bitcoin futures but are more cautious. Thomas Book, chief executive of Deutsche Börse’s Eurex Exchange, said timing was crucial in launching a new derivatives contract.
 
“We still do see challenges that have to be tackled in close discussion with our clients. It is important for an exchange to follow a sustainable approach on this asset class well co-ordinated with the market.”
 
Thomas Peterffy, a pioneer of electronic trading and head of Interactive Brokers, has warned that the introduction of bitcoin futures into a clearing house could increase systemic risk. On Wednesday Interactive said its clients would be unable to short the bitcoin futures market because of the extreme volatility of bitcoin.

We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.
Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.

You're not the only one. From the article:
    It turns out that only 9 of the first 275 checks that I've sent out since the beginning of 2006 have actually been cashed.
So it seems a certificate/acknowledgement is far more valuable than any monetary value. And a message on the blockchain is far less valuable to pretty much everyone than a note with his signature on it.

If someone has access to the private key of your wallet, they can listen to the transactions that are being broadcasted. Once they spot a transaction that's being sent to an address that they can control, they can immediately send out another transaction that's sending funds from that address to another address. It's something you can do yourself as well.
The only reason certain websites/shops require n-confirmations is to prevent the funds from rolling back if there was another chain that became longer where funds were send to another address instead (double-spend attack).
So your private key already got compromised before you sent the funds there (since someone was actively listening for transactions to that wallet). My guess is you used a fake website pretending to be blockchain[.]com or you got infected by some mallware.

Timestamp is specified by the miner who finds the block. Block was probably found shortly after the previous block, combine that with a machine that has its time slightly out of sync could cause this to happen.
Since timestamps are specified by the miner, a certain flexibility has to be allowed.

When you're batching, you reduce the number of outputs as well. When an exchange transfers something to their customer, they (usually/often) create 2 outputs. 1 for the customer, 1 for their change, going back in their wallet.
Now take batching, group 20 withdraw requests in one, making it 21 outputs (again, depending on how it's setup/etc...), 20 outputs going to their customer, 1 for the change.
Before it would generate 20 x 2 = 40 outputs, now it's 21 outputs.

@_date: 2018-03-12 08:52:17
Which is an intended consequence of batching. Where before you would have 2 outputs on average for each transaction (1 for the target, the other for change), now you have a lot less, as each target in the batch share one change output.
For example: 20 batched transactions now has 1 change output, which could have been 20 change outputs in unbatched transactions.
