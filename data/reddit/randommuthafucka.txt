It wasn't "as expensive as a car" when those pre-orders were made. What a moronic argument. They were ~$100.
Were the original bitcoin pizzas 4 million dollars each? Of course not.

Protip: Every time someone buys, someone else is selling.
@_date: 2013-09-05 05:27:40
It hasn't "cost you hundreds of dollars". If you sell now, with a loss then that's your choice.
Personally I'm hoping for another fall so I can buy more at--or close to--$68.
Please carefully consider what your opinion will be if and when the value reaches $1k, or 10k. Or zero. I'm sure you've heard it a million times--don't invest what you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:32:30
Same here brah. If it wasn't for interest in SR (i.e. DMT and Psilocybin) I would never have gotten into Bitcoin when I did. Now that interest and appreciation of value has over tripled my yearly income this year, just from a 4-figure investment.

I don't feel sorry for anyone who sells during these flash crashes. They pretty much happen weekly, if not daily.
If people had done their due diligence, educated themselves, and watched the price for awhile before buying in then they would know to expect it and not freak out.
Thanks for the cheap coins.

Dude, it's a generic email sent out whenever a problem occurs. They have very little support staff. But if you did your research, most of those threads end in the person who complained about the "high risk" email actually had a problem with their bank. The funds available were insufficient, the bank flagged the transaction for whatever reason, etc.
I pay attention to nearly all of those threads because I use Coinbase and I want to be informed if they are doing sketchy stuff.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:53:28

He doesn't even know what a "crash" is. Crashes don't rebound in a day, let alone 20 freaking minutes.
@_date: 2013-07-31 05:13:53
Well, bitcoin is largely deflationary, and some businesses do want investments so that they aren't getting hit by the inflation of USD and other currencies.
As a business owner, this is something I'm doing myself right now--buying stock at cost, selling via the bitcoin network, and saving those coins due to my belief that the value will rise.
That is opposed to letting my savings sit in a normal bank savings account at %0.09  interest.
TL;DR - I'm buying bitcoins for roughly 40% of their value by selling products for bitcoin.
Is that going to be good for someone who doesn't want to invest in bitcoin? No. But that was the point of my suggestion--to show the value of bitcoin. People are not used to using a currency that actually gains value while holding on to it.
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:25:40
Hmm, no bitcoin symbol anywhere on the homepage though? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:35:18
Yeah that's kind of.. not the best way to go. He's paying out 16% of every "bit" he buys to fees ://

@_date: 2013-11-27 04:32:32
You are misinformed. You only need to see the transfer, and maybe one confirmation at best--for a VERY large purchase.

If bitcoin doesn't work (we don't know what that reason is *right now*), then it would be best to make a new crypto that fixes that exact problem, rather than going with the next most popular one "just because".

@_date: 2013-11-28 19:06:13
You have to add a Visa to your account so they can charge it if the bank transfer fails... which is why it takes so long for you to get your BTC in the first place.
@_date: 2013-09-02 10:59:17
How does that solve a problem in which Person 1 says they didn't receive a product ordered and Person 2 says they sent it?
Or another example, as many escrow services rely on tracking services to at least prove that something was sent and delivered... Person one orders item valued at ฿5.0 but claim they have received a different item, some worthless book or a literal brick etc. that weighs approximately or equal to what the ordered item weighs. Tracking, in this instance actually proves nothing--only that something was sent and delivered.

Hi Matt Miller. Mind telling us why you lied saying you had to give your social security number to be able to buy bitcoin? I have a Coinbase account and I didn't have to give my SSN. Why do you make it sound like it is anymore troublesome than it is opening a bank account?
We have to give identification because of government regulation, not because it's a part of Bitcoin's complexity.

What does that even mean? If you're going to arbitrage bitcoin, you don't need some intermediary coin to do it--you just buy the bitcoin from where it is cheaper and sell it where it is selling for more. That's all arbitrage is.
So what are you talking about when you say use it for bitcoin arbitrage?
@_date: 2013-10-21 07:09:05
How about.... you read the subreddit history for the past 6 months rather than asking to be spoonfed all the info or something.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:59:39
So, something with the means to replace other money, was never meant to place other money, which is... pretty damn valuable.
And it's **not** even a currency--it's money. Currency is basically a placeholder--a representation of money. Money is better. Bitcoin has all the characteristics of money. And it's obviously valuable, so I'm not sure what abstract point you think you're making.
You seem to be sort of a nutjob. It's been fun.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:34:58
You don't know that. You're applying ancient archetypes to something completely new.
Imagine trying to ban/outlaw the computer, and by that I mean any computer--period. Or cars, by which tens of thousands of people die every single year--much more than terrorism and many forms of disease.
Outlawing those is not going to happen. It's not even realistic.
If bitcoin/cryptos in general saves value for people in countries like Argentina and Greece and prevents corruption and tyranny... then trust me, cryptocurrencies are not going anywhere. It doesn't matter how illegal any one country makes them, even if for a little while, like alcohol.
They can't even keep drugs out of prison ffs, or make a working healthcare website. You give them too much credit.
And "nothing without fiat"? Do you have any idea how many countries would love to see the end to the petrol dollar? How many countries want to have their currency valued less than some other country's?
The petrol dollar has to end eventually. And then a worldwide currency that is fungible anywhere, in a worldwide economy would seem to be a plausible evolutionary step even without crypto. But with crypto, something they can't stop even if they want to? 
@_date: 2013-10-12 04:51:12

I'd say it's highly likely considering the value has climbed thousands of % this year--much of that just in the last couple of weeks. The price was $2 not that long ago, lol.
I don't follow LTC much but I'd have to imagine there is a mad rush to mine right now. I'd be very curious how fast the difficulty is rising due to people jumping on board.

Those services get people using it, first and foremost. Developing the infrastructure for using bitcoin is arguably the single most important factor for mass adoption.
Again, if you thought bitcoin would be successful on a grande scale, as a world currency, by only those bitcoin fanatic and nerds using it, then I'd love to hear how you think that would happen.
You'd be asking people who don't really care much about bitcoin to take a huge risk for something that they don't even understand. At the very least, people can buy things with their bitcoin. That way it is more fungible, and can more clearly resemble a real currency.
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:32:09
Because (conceivably, anyways) fiat will be basically phased out as people use them less and less due to a superior money entering the market.
But there's no reason why, when that happens, we can't call .00 whatever *dollars* out of tradition. 
Whatever ends up being the common term for certain denominations, that's what it will be. And it won't happen until people are ready for it so I don't see the point in trying to force it.

This. It takes time because a bank transfer takes time. 
Of course you can't cancel. You bought the BTC at the specified rate. The deal is done. If they allowed people to cancel after the fact, then people would abuse that by cancelling if the price drops at all before their BTC is paid for and arrives.
@_date: 2013-09-19 07:15:18

It's a big deal because the currency (it's not ONLY a currency) is really starting to take off. At this moment 1 BTC is trading for almost $800 USD. 2 years ago it was trading for $2.

Again, you're ignoring the difficulty of CREATING the network.
Please explain how a new network is going to be created and replace bitcoin in 20 minutes. 
You're also assuming that bitcoin would *need* replacing. Why would it be replaced? 
 
Let's be honest here. You're applying current technological trends of advancement to bitcoin, which is a currency not a camera on an iphone or a computer hard drive.
That's quite an assumption without a rationale to go with it.
Physical currency has lasted for thousands of years because until recently, nothing could beat it by way of functionality. Making the statement that bitcoin will almost certainly be replaced by some better form (without even saying how this replacement currency is better) is quite bold, indeed.

@_date: 2013-10-31 16:21:37

But enough of that. Please tell me why just holding isn't the best advice, given the fact that the value has always corrected back up? Always. You yourself admit that that is true. Barring some unknown flaw with the protocol, how is that not the best position to hold? (And I'm not saying *how much* to hold) I'm just saying telling people to sell 99% of their BTC is crazy.

No offense, but for someone to trust you, they would be either very foolish or very stupid. I'm not saying you're not trustworthy--but no one knows you're trustworthy. You could screw someone over and there would be literally zero recourse.
That's a lot of money, so I can definitely empathize with you wanting to be careful. You should be careful. But so should anyone that may be able to help you. And going to Paskistan is definately not careful...

@_date: 2013-11-28 19:04:07
Look, that just doesn't make sense.
Say  you are like coinbase--you are selling bitcoin. You agree to sell me a bitcoin at 1000, but then 2 days later the price goes down to 800. Well that's not your fault right? Would you like me to be able to cancel the thing I committed to buying just because it went down in value? (And of course, if the value goes up then it would all be peachy on my end, no doubt)
That would never work. They would go out of business in a day operating like that.
Like others have eluded to, you really haven't done your research  as your clear lack of understanding (and dare say I--common sense) shows.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:52:42
If said country lives in a bubble and never wanted to do International trading or have tourists etc., sure it could work. But would it be valuable anywhere else and matter? Nope.
I mean, all you're describing is national currencies which already exist. You don't need to think hypothetically. You can see real-world examples of what you're talking about. And many of those currencies are worth more in that they can be burned for warmth--than they are worth for trading purposes.

I'm a big fan of Jeffrey Tucker. His enthusiasm for Bitcoin is quite contagious. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:46:15
So would you say that's "fuzzy" math?
The last bubbles (as rises that preceded them) didn't have legitimate reasons to why they existed. The current rise DOES. Mass adoption is beginning.
Is some of it speculation? Of course. But we just had a 21,000 coin sell that rebounded in an hour, then went to a new all-time high. The event that brought on the April crash was nowhere near as potentially damaging as that. And bitstamp went down for a bit today.... and what happened? Nothing.
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:59:13
Congrats! Once the Bloomberg news hits the masses I think you'll be quite pleased with your decision. This week will be **very** interesting.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:49:03
That wasn't an attack. That was just the truth.
If you're so insecure, maybe you're not ready to invest at all.
I was skeptical too. But I spent months learning about everything I could before I bought any. Have you done that or are you just looking for others to tell you what to do?
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:47:23
What infrastructure? lol  There was hardly any back then.... HENCE THE BUBBLE. It was all smoke. It was a little media hype and that was it. It didn't even last a night!
Did we have China buying in hardcore then? Did we have Shopify and hundreds/thousands of merchants accepting bitcoin back then? Hell no, and you know it. Both the infrastructure of April and of 2011 were practically nonexistent.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:46:22
They are deprioritizing address re-use in reaction to the whole CoinValidation thing. I clearly remember it being mentioned, so maybe you should do a little more research OP.

That's cool. I didn't know about the history there so thanks for the explanation.  
I'd never send him money but it doesn't bother me at all that people have :)
I just hope it's legit. If it hits major news outlets and with him supposedly pledging everything over 2 BTC to charity, I just hope it doesn't come out that it was manufactured by him sending the big tips to himself or something, and not making the donation etc.

I didn't say you got out at the bottom of the flash crash, rather you sold, and the people selling during that time *caused* the crash.
So, thanks =)
Why so angry?
What's ropey, exactly? Do you think it's nothing less than amazing that a 21,000 coin sell caused a flash crash that completely rebounded in 90 minutes? That's solidarity.

My advice is to set up an account at Coinbase and then watch the price for a week. Look at the history of the price of Bitcoin. Get level 2 verified. Watch the volatility.
Have money in the bank account that you linked to Coinbase and be ready to buy at any given time. Then, during the next flash crash, buy however much you plan to commit to.
*A flash crash is defined as a short-lived drop in the price. We had one last week when suddenly the price dropped from ~200 to ~160 and went back up to ~190 within a couple of hours--then back up to 200 by the next day.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:22:27
"There are also many factors that may contribute to a crash, you should consider those as well. "
Yep, and one of them is telling noobies who just bought in (most with at least a 1% fee in order to do so) to sell 99% of the coin they just bought.
That's some seriously irresponsible advice and if you're anyone who should be giving advice then you should really know better. And I very much doubt you have taken your own advice.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:08:26
You're fine. You won't be charged more than you agreed to.
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:28:04
Not exactly true, since ASICS can be made for LTC. kncminer has said they might do so. A lot of manufacturers would not bother because people would not buy them until the price of LTC (value rising) demanded it. With increased value leads to increased competition. So unless this LTC bubble pops huge and doesn't rebound, expect ASICs for LTC very soon.
Would ASICs for LTC scale as hugely as SHA-256 does for BTC? No, probably not. But it would still be huge in relation to what you can mine LTC right now with a GPU. If ASICS kick off for LTC then the average user will earn practically nothing by mining LTC--just as that is true with BTC ASICs today.

Jesus Christ. This is normal procedure. If you haven't gotten approved for instant buys then it takes about a week to get your coin because they must get the funds first from your bank, which is SLOW.

Quit fucking bitching about it.

Cold storage. Best option is Armory. You'll want an offline laptop to do the most secure method. Then you can make paper wallets, put them on usb flash drives, etc. to stash, put in bank box, bury... maybe even create horcrux if you want to get really creative.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:04:04
All that you just told me is that you can't predict the future. Guess what--no one can.
Quit worrying about short-term price. Long term is what matters. Either you believe bitcoin will succeed or you don't. And if you do, then long term is ALL that matters (unless of you're you're a seasoned professional day-trader--which I'm guessing.... you're not).

2nd safest is probably an online generated paper wallet. You never want to leave a large amount with any website, which, if hacked, or taken down forever will leave your bitcoin in limbo forever.

So any businesses that accept bitcoin is merely speculating? I think your view is shallow, though not entirely incorrect.
If I accept bitcoin, then I am getting paid for my goods/services. That's definitive "business", right there.
I've grown my business as big as it can get as far as stockroom allows, so my additional capital/savings are accumulating until I can expand. Investing in bitcoin, in my opinion, is a far better investment than letting my money slowly rot in a savings account.
You're free with your opinion--to do with your savings what you will, of course.

If and when bitcoin ever goes global and reaches $100,000+ per coin, will it really matter if you bought at 600 or 900?
And to make my point as to why that could potentially be a disastrous hesitation (assuming you believe in bitcoin and have already decided to invest--at some point),what if, some random day Amazon or some other market leader announces that they will be incorporating bitcoin into their marketplace? The value would skyrocket... maybe tenfold, maybe more.
You wouldn't want to be left *not* holding the bag, if that happened. Just sayin'

The advantage is, you get yours first. Any device like this is cheaper down the road.

And your point is? As more money pours into mining and there are more miners, that number only rises. 
Unless and until LTC surpasses BTC in market cap it will always be cheaper and easier to attack the LTC network.

No--it hasn't. It is still the same cost in bitcoin. Period. How you don't understand that is beyond me.
Just because the value of the USD *lessens* in relation to bitcoin, doesn't mean that the trezor costs more.
If all you think of bitcoin is its value in relation to other currencies, then that's your problem--and your mental limitation.

"Doubling" in the life of bitcoin is not all that substantial, considering it has doubled thousands of times since its birth.
If the volatility is that big of a deal to you, maybe you should gtfo of bitcoin.
If all bitcoin means to you is its relation to one of the many fiat currencies, then maybe you should gtfo of bitcoin.

Why mess with 2 when 1 is easier? Simple logistics.
It's like trying to stick an extra wing on a bird that flies perfectly as is.
It's going to be hard enough convincing the masses all the intricacies of using and maintaining wallets, etc.  Now imagine telling them they need to have all sorts of types of wallets for who knows how many types of coins. 
Litecoin (as an example) doesn't improve on bitcoin enough to matter, and if it ever did, bitcoin could just integrate that improvement if it was deemed as a must-have by the network. 
 It doesn't matter what the exchanges want--it matters what 1-7 billion people want. And few would want to use two "coins" when it's so much easier to only use one.

Every "correction" has been followed by a rebound that fully recovered and pushed to greater all-time highs. **Every one**. You're ignoring the upward trend.
You can always say "if", but the only way for him to truly lose money is "if" he sells for less than he purchased for. And to do so would be betting against the historical data of the bitcoin market.

I recommended buying during all-time highs of 300 all the way up through the Monday Congressional hearing (700). Recommending to not buy during an all-time high is the easiest thing in the world if all you're doing is turning your brain off and looking at the similarity of 2 charts.

Indeed, plus it's also **many** times cheaper, which is what matters most. That factor included, bitcoin wins by a landslide.

I don't know why it's so hard to take in/believe. Apple's stock has multiplied by 228 since initial IPO and market cap of over $1B (now at over $500B).
If you bought Apple at $22, you might be saying that same thing, yet it wouldn't make it any less legit.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:01:40
That's nice. I don't care if you want my opinion or not. That works both ways, as you can tell.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:48:41
Not really. The former sounds like something that could have come about due to an unfortunate accident, or just bad luck or something. 
The latter implies intent, which is quite accurate.

No. No you can't. You can still only buy 1 trezor for 1 bitcoin (the one-day sale tomorrow aside). That hasn't changed.

Begging is not allowed here.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:59:36
The rate is unsustainable, but that doesn't mean there will be some huge bubble burst. It could just simply taper off/slow down.
Saying there will definitely be a massive drop is pure bullshit.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:10:31
Yep. So what you're not including in your little plan is the pitfall of when you get nervous during some crappy little crash flash (which happen every week, if not ever single day in this volatile economy) and you sell all of your coins. Then the price bounces back 2 hours later and you're screwed.
You just lost all of your future investment. Unless of course, you regretfully buy back in having learned your lesson--and in which case you just paid Coinbase a 1% fee on the way out, and then a 1% fee on the way back in.
But maybe you should learn that lesson the hard way.
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:04:33
No I'm really not. Maybe others have done that to you in the past and you have a chip on your shoulder. 
I'm just seriously thankful to be able to buy cheap coins is all.
Peace and cheers and all the best to you.
I know you're skeptical because of past bubbles, but the April bubble and the climb that preceded it was basically all hype. There was no foundation/reason for the climb. But all this stuff with China? And with the U.S. Federal government basically saying they are not our enemy? And with the infrastructure growing every day? This has teeth. This has spine. This has foundation.
This is not a bubble, imo. And I'll be happy to come back and admit I was wrong if that turns out to be the case.
P.S. 620 is nothing to sneer at anyways. Guaranteed you made a sweet gain no matter when you bought in, so that's awesome :)
@_date: 2013-07-07 05:51:48
Because physical objects can be "somewhat" proven to have at least been shipped and delivered (delivery confirmation). That's the primary basis on which Paypal uses to determine the outcome of a dispute.
Was an item actually shipped, and did it arrive?
With nonphysical items, that's not possible, so it's much harder for sellers to be able to prove they completed their part of the transaction. And that makes it much easier for scammers to scam those sellers.
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:55:55
lol you don't need LTC to do that. And what do you mean "when LTC price is lower on stamp than on gox"? LTC isn't on Gox.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:57:19
I cried laughing.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:08:08
1) People made this exact point weeks ago when what Schiff said was new. 
2) Don't beg for upvotes, bitch.

K, so buy more now so you don't have to make a duplicate thread in a year/month/week.

Now is not April. We didn't have anywhere near the infrastructure in April that we do now. Any moron can look at 2 charts and say: "Uhhhhh, these match."
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:45:59
Except it didn't go to 200 when it dropped from 900, did it?
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:46:20
lol. right.
And if they took your advice you're giving **now**... *back then*, and sold at the $2 bubble or $10 bubble or whatever, then they wouldn't even have those valuable coins today.
You know plenty of people sold out at $2, and $10, etc. right?
Because you haven't read enough of the "daytrading" mishaps I'll Never Do That Again posts, and let alone the no-brainer that noobies to bitcoin should be the last people to be trying to daytrade...
Like I said more than once now, holding is best. Selling 99% of our BTC? Worst advice imaginable, actually.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:44:04
Now you understand the meaning of *just hold*.

I'm not sure what your point is. The huge spread between BTCChina and the other exchanges couldn't last forever. China is still the highest.

Once you answer the same question a dozen times, it gets old.
@_date: 2013-10-31 23:42:14
Well, whenever you invested... it's gone up since then right? So to follow your own ill thinking, you would never buy anything until it drops below what you paid for it, right?
I'm sorry, but that's just stupid.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:37:44
It's realistic because IF bitcoin ever attains massive world-wide adoption, it HAS TO get that high just because of the finite amount that exists.
Will that happen? Who knows.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:29:25
So you never sell, yet you tell others to sell? Hmmmm.
@_date: 2013-12-08 10:41:14
You honestly believe ALL the governments of the world would ban bitcoin just because a major government does? Most governments want the petrodollar undermined. You think smaller governments are too stupid to realize that?
Of course companies couldn't use it in that ONE country it was banned. But so what? Did the rest of the world ban alcohol when U.S. did? 
If the U.S. banned bitcoin, that prohibition would probably last for much less time than alcohol prohibition did, because the rest of the world would be passing it by, gleefully as the petrodollar is gutted forever.
And during that time, you'd still have individuals in the U.S. putting their value-dropping dollars into bitcoin as a store of value until prohibition is repealed.
The U.S. can't even keep drugs out of the borders, or out of their prisons. They can't stop online piracy. What makes you think they could possibly stop bitcoin wallets?
Would U.S. prohibition slow down bitcoin adoption? Surely. But **kill** bitcoin? That's funny.

Coinbase now at 604! Add the 1% fee and you're looking at 610 to buy.
Keep in mind, when Gox broke 600 late last night, Coinbase was only at 530.
They are getting SLAMMED.

Contact this guy. It's worth a shot.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:32:22
There are lots of grains of sand on the Earth. What are those worth? There's a lot of gold in the universe. What is that worth when we have access to more than we could ever do with?
Your books only taught you what their authors intended to teach you: how they want you to think, and what they want you to believe.
And you're really breaking that weak-ass argument... econ class, into a discussion about cryptocurrency? Something that is certainly NOT in any of those books.
I get supply and demand, but guess what? What has more demand? Something that can't be counterfeited no matter how many space mountains of gold we find in the next 100,000 years or something which is designed with a limitation from the beginning?
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:34:48
Do the same what? Make weakass "predictions" that have a pretty damn good chance of coming true? Anyone can do that. What's the significance? 
Anyone with any sort of intelligence would call someone out for such nonsense, because it's basically calling a coinflip and then acting like some incredible sage when the flip is in your favor.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:05:49
Sure, by that I mean the second step of your process, buying 1 BTC from the cheaper exchange and moving to the higher valued exchange. You only need bitcoin to do that. How would LTC help with that process?
What is the "more arbitrage opportunities"?

brb, moving to the cool Korea.

Why don't you give him a paper wallet with the tip in it?
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:44:15
There are still LOTS of people that desperately wanted to buy yesterday but could not. Those people have to set up accounts and verify identity etc. That takes time.
Expect gradual rise from that alone, for the next 7 days at least.
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:35:41
No, I'm not saying you should trust anyone. Definitely do not send the .dat to anyone. 
But there are people in the bitcoin community that certainly can be trusted, so maybe someone like that can act as a mediator of sorts.
You've told your story. Now hopefully a clever person can come up with a good solution to this interesting dilemma. Take a little time figuring it out. There's no need to make a hasty move.
@_date: 2013-12-08 11:01:42
Oh thank you, THANK YOU for coming here to warn me. When your system is so good, so kind, and so awesome for me as an individual and as a consumer.

@_date: 2013-11-19 11:21:46

I don't know why you're so paranoid. Maybe you should pose that question to yourself.
Coinbase is super secure and easy. If you're so incredibly worried, unlink your bank account after you buy the coins you want.
You're making this way harder than it should be. You are. It's not on bitcoin or any other entity--it's on you.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:38:08
Ok, so how does that arbitrage work if you never went to USD at all with your example? Can you show me with actual numerical examples?
And say you're dealing with two exchanges that use LTC, wouldn't the LTC value be inflated (LTC2) for the same reason the BT2 value is inflated?
@_date: 2013-10-31 23:47:54
lol, holy shit you are dense. Leave the USD out of it! They don't sell via USD so you are injecting absolute bullshit into the equation.
How much was the plastic trezor when the pre-order was first made available? 1 BCT. How much is it now? 1 BCT.

Dropped 600? We're at 800 and were at 1100, 24 hours ago. Cool math, bro.
"Crash" isn't something that last hours or a couple of days. All we are seeing is weak hands folding. What we're at next week/next month is much more important. If this rather normal volatility scares you, maybe you should not be speculating.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:57:43
Cool story... and maybe you're just a Peter Schiff shill then?
The bitcoin network has intrinsic value. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:49:31
Well, I guess the point is, you don't have to do "Instant Verification" if you don't want to give SSN--and if you're not in a big hurry. I never had to give SSN and that is a fact.
All of the other things you listed you have to give out for any banking activity. I just don't think it was fair criticism.
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:58:29
No, it's not a stretch. You're the one who said governments may try to outlaw cryptocurrency. I merely compared it to another type of good that governments try to stop--which is failing miserably, I might add.

So you want us to just send you BTC directly, not knowing if it's even legit? If you have a link to an actual charitable organization, great, but so far your page looks rather sketchy.
This falls under the begging category, imo.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:15:03
Look, please drop the conspiracy theory crap. When they're selling to you then its because they ran out of coin, so they're basically giving you an IOU for whatever the market rate is. Is it a gamble? Yes, it is. But no one is forcing you to do it. And they certainly aren't trying to screw you, but merely trying to sell you the thing you want to buy.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:45:28
stamp, base, and badgers don't give no fucks, son.
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:03:59
No one *hates* litecoin. It's just unrealistic for more than one cryptocurrency to go full-blown world-wide adoption.
Plus, anything an alt coin integrates and is successful with, bitcoin can integrate as well.
Alt coins can definitely serve a purpose in various niches but only one will be going to the moon.
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:10:32
There is no such thing as a physical bitcoin. These are just paper wallets with the private key that comes with the  physical coin. And the producers of these coins aren't even loading them with bitcoin anymore, because of FINCEN concern. 
You could buy a paper wallet from anyone, and without the huge markup that comes along with it.
@_date: 2013-10-25 07:26:14
That's not too high. If bitcoin reaches 2 trillion--and at that time there are say, 15 billion BTC, then the value of a single Bitcoin would be over $100,000.
@_date: 2013-11-13 03:00:11
Wow, most of your points are absolutely incorrect.
You don't understand bitcoin anymore than Schiff.
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:29:56
Yeah, I love that he enjoys so much giving advice at the end of the clip--as if anyone would listen to his advice after he just proved how ignorant he is.
He even suggested as much that bitcoin is/was only used to buy drugs. Derp.
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:51:54
Haha, he got Schiff to say "I wish I bought bitcoin years ago". Maybe he's starting to get it. Baby steps.

You could always reply with the example of [m-pesa]( which is basically a digital currency which works quite well. In some of these countries, their national currency is much more volatile than bitcoin, if not practically worthless altogether.
Once bitcoin catches on in some of these countries, the "fair trade" this person is discussing will be apparent.
Do many people speculate with bitcoin? Sure, but one does not have to.
@_date: 2013-07-31 04:06:09
Hey OP, if you really want to prove your point to the sellers of this game, you should:
Once a month send an email detailing how much the Bitcoin you would have sent in payment for the game has increased in value, compared to how much the USD has decreased in value due to inflation.
After awhile they just might understand.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:06:22
Of course he says that now as an attempt to save face, lol.
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:28:09
Wow, that huge sell only caused a 90 minute flash crash. We are solid.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:13:37
It is. High risk = we can't give you the bitcoin you agreed to buy because the bank transfer failed.
Do your research. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:47:53

Wow, *that* argument. How low you must go...
Sorry, people are actually being paid in bitcoin. Bitcoin users are actually buying quite a number of goods with it, and that is only getting better. Change doesn't happen overnight. Your argument that it hasn't happened overnight is no way to disprove the adoption process.
There was a point in time when fiat didn't even exist. You know that, right?

This is the best answer. Plus, in 2016-2017 the block reward will halve again so there will be a whole lot less coin coming in which will cut down on the artificial inflation from those "created" coins.
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:24:26

Just to confirm, you're the same guy that said bitcoins were only worth about $1 earlier this year, right?
I mean no disrespect, but I really do think we're long past the $2 bubble at this point. 
You got into bitcoin long before I did, so much respect for that, and I hope you benefited greatly. I just think you're underestimating how fast the infrastructure is developing.

If you're truly a bitcoin supporter, that's the worst argument you can make. The price is in bitcoin--and only bitcoin. Using the perceived value by converting to fiat (and then back to bitcoin, because it is ONLY available to be purchased via bitcoin) does us absolutely no favors.

And you only know it's a bubble after it pops. Until then, it only *might be* a perpetual bubble and **literally is** seeing as how everything ends, anyways--including our universe.
Btw, when is this bubble going to pop? Since you know, right? And after it does, when do we buy back in? Cause you know that too, right? Assuming you didn't want us readers to sell off permanently and all--seeing as how, historically, having bitcoin is better than not having bitcoin and all. Right?

Most ASICs only maintain profitability for a few months. Ask him to show you his expected take in the next few months given the expected mining difficulty increase and factoring in his power consumption.
Eventually (most within 6 months) the power consumption will be greater than the value of coin he's actually receiving.

I predicted rises during all time highs of 300, 350, 400, 500, 600 and 700... something much more daring than predicting a "correction" during an all-time high which is easiest thing in the world to do, imo.

Good points. It's clear that we will need escrow services in the near future. Maybe some new technology will be pioneered that can help prove who is to believed in disputes? But until then, it's hard to imagine any scenario in which there's no possibility of scamming on one side or another.
Even escrow services are far from perfect. But it's much better than nothing, i.e. full, naked risk to one side (buyer or seller).

While theoretically true, it's not currently true because we're still inflationary due to all the coins coming in from mining 7200, and now, 3600 per day. 
Now imagine if all this time we hadn't been getting that inflation. And imagine when those 25 BTC blocks halve, and then halve again in the next 7 years and we truly see that deflationary effect you're talking about.
It *is* a legitimate form of money because it is a vessel for transfer of value--which is all money really is. You can call it bartering or whatever you want. That's all money is--a transfer of value from one person to another based on the belief of that value.
I'm not on the "collect bitcoin" bandwagon. I just see all the advancement and I see the only direction is up. One of the most important things right now is not hoarding--it's infrastructure of commerce. The belief by people has to be there for people to be able to trust it, and that happens when people spend it and when the people they give it to know that they can then spend it--ideally on anything they want.
What's the point of selling, and why would you ever sell if the trend is always up? These "crashes" you seem to goddamned worried about? I don't even flinch. 266 to 80? So what? 900 to 500? So what? I wasn't even worried because I see the big picture, while you're worried about the insignificant day-to-day nonsense.
I "got involved" after months of research before I even bought any because it took awhile to understand how revolutionary it all could be. And if something can be so revolutionary, why are you so worried about current man-made "laws" and "regulations"? They're not real laws--laws of nature. They're man-made. And those laws are only in our head. That can SO easily be changed, as history has shown us time and time again.

Easy, escrow. They already are an escrow service. Sellers must provide successful shipment of items etc.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:38:45
If bitcoin was found to have a fatal flaw, then the next successful coin would be engineered around that flaw. 
It's incredibly unlikely that a current coin would possess that quality, seeing that most of the current alts are clones with a few tweaks to differentiate from the original and the rest.
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:54:12
Bad analogy. You don't need anyone to hold your bitcoin for you--that's one of its best aspects. If you have all your bitcoin on any online CENTRALIZED place, then it's your own fault if your coin gets flushed along with them.
@_date: 2013-11-14 08:22:48
It really is that easy. It just comes down to common sense. Would you trust any random person to hold a significant amount of valuables for you? No? Then just don't do it. And with bitcoin, there's literally no reason to.
BE YOUR OWN BANK is all you need to do.
And don't blame Bitcoin for foolish decisions that *people* make. If someone goes into a casino and puts 100k on black, no one blames the dollar.

The angle is, a lot of the edgiest most daring in the financial community *have already come into the bitcoin market* with their personal money. That's why the price just shot up 1000% in the last couple of months and has stayed there--more or less.

And a fall that bounces back in hours or days is not a crash. A crash is a considerable drop in value for a significant length of time. This is not that.

No one forced BFL to make delivery deadline guarantees. Escrow is "workable" because people who did pay and never received their product have gotten their money back. I think that satisfies the definition of working.
That's all true if money is in escrow--that's the point of escrow. If they go bankrupt the money in escrow is untouchable by BFL as it is not their funds until they deliver the promised goods.

So knowing that, how is selling 99% of BTC holdings as OP has advocated better than just holding?
Plus he's completely reckless with his advice, knowing that there are lots of noobs who just bought in (most with a cost of 1% fee to begin with). And they should sell 99% of their holdings??
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:23:08
They literally ran out of coins due to all the buyers, lol.
So take that as a great sign, but it's probably best to ignore that price until they have liquidity. 
@_date: 2013-09-19 11:46:34
Paypal is an escrow service that allows a trusted seller to access the funds immediately--which I have no doubt BFL were able to do--and did. But they still have to deliver the product...
You're conflating the issues. Your saying "chargebacks are impossible with bitcoin" is as meaningless as saying chargebacks are impossible with cash. Of course chargebacks are not built into bitcoin--they are not built into cash or gold either.
But can we have chargebacks and escrow with bitcoin payments? Absolutely. We can and do have them with cash and credit and gold, too.
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:42:15
I didn't say it's a predictor of success. But he clearly thought it was going to go back anyways, because **he bought back in**.
And just as I can't predict that it will go back up, you cannot predict that it will not.
But that's not the point. The point was, the only way he will definitely, absolutely, 100% realize a loss from the price of BTC going down, is if he sells. Before then, it is still unrealized as to whether or not there was a net loss. If he didn't sell, there's still a possibility that there would be no actual loss.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:30:05
I agree. And FYI OP, when you sell BTC the deposit of USD they send takes ~4 days, but when you buy BTC they try to obtain the USD in 1-2 days tops.
@_date: 2013-07-30 04:48:35
This is a good thing. Bitcoin's value should not depend on the workings--or lack thereof--of any entity.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:14:32
lol, you pretty much "predicted" that bitcoin swings in value ~$100 a day. I could do that every day and be right at least half of the time.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:25:33
Yeah, regret's a bitch.. but at least know that if this thing goes full-blown worldwide adoption, we're less than 1% of that potential RIGHT NOW.
You're going to die someday, one way or another.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:20:19
No, it's not hard to understand it's just something I choose not to dedicate the time to doing. I like to start actual businesses.
I guarantee you make "bad guesses" with your game and you lose money. You're just not admitting to it.
You could just as easily go onto Just Dice and make similar gambles. The thing is, even if I did that I would never claim to be some amazing "prediction expert" when I hit a win--because I see it for what it is, a coin toss.

So, fake and scripted then--got it.
@_date: 2013-09-04 07:46:54
Yeah, I'm with you. "Regulators" don't have the power they like to make people think they do--not over the world, anyways.
I absolutely LOVED Joerg Platzer's responses during the LetsTalkBitcoin Bitcoin Foundation Councilmember Debate.
One quote: "Cryptocurrency will regulate regulators. What we urgently need to do is consult and educate governments in regards to how they could participate in moderating the transition to a cryptoeconomic society so that this transition will be as smooth as possible."
Giving them power, "just because" they're used to having it will only end with Bitcoin becoming just another Paypal. No thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:07:10
I wouldn't even know about Bitcoin (probably) if it wasn't for reading about SR.
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:19:36
What an awful suggestion. 
Would you equally support them cancelling your order if the value of bitcoin halved since you placed your order?
@_date: 2013-11-06 08:45:24
Really? Then you're completely ignoring the difficulty of creating a network that people trust, that is not premined, etc. and that isn't destroyed by manipulation before it gets big enough to matter. 
Bitcoin as already achieved that (so far). That's the hardest factor and you're completely ignoring that point.
You should probably look at the graveyard of the many alt coins and the reasons why it's not as easy as simply making the "coin".
@_date: 2013-12-11 11:47:10
You do raise good points--no doubt. I just think if that they are desperate, they would even take a risk by accepting bitcoin, anyways. I don't think it would be a huge problem either way, especially if they document everything, as other companies in the bitcoin space are doing right now specifically because there is lack of guidance from the IRS.
I can see why they might be hesitant, but if the other option is to to shut down because of lack of funding, then I would think taking all meaningful donations would be the better option.
Even losing 501c status is better than closing down due to lack of funding.
@_date: 2013-10-31 23:36:52
You could say that about everything, so it's a poor argument at best.
Never spend money--got it.

@_date: 2013-08-27 03:28:20
Yeah I agree. I humbly laugh that those that think the U.S. market is a necessity in order for Bitcoin to survive/thrive.
No one nation can stop Bitcoin, and no one nation will have a significant effect on the market even with an outright ban of bitcoin marketplace processing.

Yeah, the amount of Derp in that video is hilarious. If they haven't educated themselves on even some of the basics about bitcoin, then they have no business giving an assumingly educated opinion about it.

Good to know, thanks. That could be a very interesting time, for sure.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:40:27

Yeah i saw that weeks ago, for sure. He said he was waiting for a crash (which I commented was a bad idea) so who knows if he actually bought any.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:13:24
And you think that zero-day vulnerability will be something that litecoin is immune to because of its such limited variability in relation to bitcoin in the first place?
Not bloody likely.

It's not as easy as Electrum, but if you want your mind at ease, that literally there is **no possible way** that your private key could be or could have ever been compromised, then it's worth the investment of the cheap laptop and the extra effort.
Once you get the blockchain downloaded, you can make the wallet within minutes.
There are some really good Armory guides/walkthroughs on youtube.
I've done the process myself, so if you decide to go that route, and run into any snags, feel free to ask me for assistance. The FAQ section on Armory's site is not very good, imo.
If you don't want to deal with all of that, I'd go with Electrum. It would be my next best option.
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:57:33
He sold. If he hadn't, when the price gets back up to his buy price, then he didn't lose anything.

Hmm, even if you're *stealing* power from someone else, making less than a penny a day is not an amount that most people would truly consider profitable.

lol, WHY? What problem are you fixing? You're delusional.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:28:36
The cost of doing a double spend = the cost of aquiring 50% of the mining network. It has nothing to with with scrypt vs. sha-256.
Right now it would cost closer to a billion dollars to do that with the bitcoin network. Litecoin? A small fraction of that.
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:20:08
The more people that want them, the more it will cost to get them. Absolutely basic Supply &amp; Demand.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:46:47
Yeah that would be much better.

Fear not friend. We rise.
@_date: 2013-12-08 10:17:29
But they're not *really* physical. One can remove the BTC from the wallet tied to that physical coin and it will then be useless--except as something to hold in your hand. A physical bitcoin thing is no different than a paper wallet that you are free to give/trade with.
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:10:00
The price rising in the rest of the world, as it is now, and because here it would be very difficult to get.
Say the U.S. bans bitcoin transactions. Well, people will still want to use it as a store of value--and there's nothing governments could do about that, short of literally turning the internet off permanently.
So people would use it as a store of value until that prohibition ended. Why would the value rise? Well, nothing has really changed, aside from prohibition in the U.S. In fact, that might motivate other countries to jump on board just because they know the U.S. will be losing ground in that space.
Many right now think that China is more or less bitcoin friendly partially to undermine the U.S. somewhat, which is certainly in their interest.
Bitcoin used to be sold on Silk Road--and at a markup. Buyers were maybe using it as a laundry (trading cash to BTC or BTC for cash) but not long ago it was harder to get BTC, so some used it for convenience. Imagine Coinbase and every other clearnet option to buy BTC was gone. People would have to go to the deep web or some International outlet to get it--and they would pay a premium which could be pretty hefty. And that would drive up demand even more.
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:41:52
As far as I know there are no laws against accepting bitcoin as a donation. If that were so, then what you say would have merit.
They're just being stubborn and everyone knows it. How many hundreds or thousands of BTC would they have gotten by now, if they had begun accepting BTC donations a year ago?
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:43:30
You said *crash*. Bad boy. No cookie.
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:10:01
They're not suspending sales until the 5th... Maybe you should read what the text *actually* says.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:11:52
What lack of clarity? It says you get an exact amount of BTC for the exact price you paid, lol. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:56:57
I've given specific reason for weeks now as to why this is not a bubble. Feel free to check.
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:32:34
I have no technical ability, friend. 
Here is what I would do. Get a trusted bitcoin community member to mediate the technical stuff with a person like Dave of walletrecoverservices. The trusted member can ideally meet up with the technical person in person and make sure that the .dat and the funds are not taken by the technical person.
Pay them each a decent amount or % and then hope that the wallet can be accessed. Make sure that this is all done transparently with the community watching. And when the wallet is open, maybe donate a little to a bitcoin based charity? 
Also, if I were you I would email Adam @ letstalkbitcoin. He knows all the top peeps, and might be able to direct you to someone who might be able to help with this odd task.
--best of luck.

Yeah. You didn't check anything. I've listed tons of infrastructure examples, and you're just ignoring those because you know I'm right. We didn't have any of that back then.
I'm not preaching a single thing. I'm not trying to get anyone to buy anything. I'm not trying to get anyone to sell anything. But this OP here is advocating people sell 99% of their BTC holdings. That's what I take issue with.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:13:45
Well that's a bummer ://
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:30:14

lol, that's partly my point. The hold strategy is really the best. It DOES keep coming back up no matter what crash has happened. 
What happens when people listen to your terrible blog advice and then the next week some major players like Amazon jump on board and the price really goes nuts?
You're leaving out a whole lot of possibilities when all you're doing is looking at your silly chart similarities.

Bitcoin is much more than just a currency. As an economist, I don't expect you to understand that, but it is beneath you to post here with such a narrow minded view and expect to be taken as some authority on the subject.
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:12:12
Sorry, but for people that are that dumb--I don't care one bit that they miss the *speculatory* bus.  And I'd rather not pander to their ignorance.
If and when they actually end up using bitcoin, it will likely be because bitcoin has won the money War and they are basically forced to. But it will also be very streamlined by then and they won't even have to think about it. What they call it, might not even *be* bitcoin when they are paying--who knows. But it will be very easy for them just like using the internet is now, for most people.

Yeah, they really must not. At best, they could say it's just a pump n' dump. But they wouldn't be able to give any evidence to that claim, even if they did. It's just an obvious counter.
Goldvalue , USD.. many other forms of value could just as easily be called a ponzi and a pump n' dump but the thing with them is: there are actually people controlling those things that we know about **for sure**.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:34:54
I didn't criticize your daytrading. I criticized the amount of self back-patting you are doing compared to how much gain you're actually receiving, and by basically calling coinflips.
I'd love to see your numbers, i.e. actual profit and then compare those to the amount of gain you would have if you had just held. Then we can see how much you're actually gaining--and if all the time you're spending is worth doing it.
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:45:29
I don't. I said I stopped bothering to do so, didn't I?
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:54:32
Every market with a small market cap is like that, or worse. It doesn't mean it's a bubble or that it will fail.
The most successful companies in existence at one time had a very small market cap and a hell of a lot of volatility.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:01:54
Well you did say that giving your SSN is a requirement. It's not. What do you call that?
You purposely or unwittingly gave an impression that it is harder to buy bitcoin than it actually is, and made it sound that it's "shady" as well. Is that your intent? Why not be impartial? And why not do a little research *before* you go on television?
You can do all those things with the currency. It's the government regulations that make things difficult. But you didn't explain that. 
I could send you a billion dollars right now, at a cost of less than a penny. And if I did it right, you'd never know who I was.
I'm sorry for being somewhat harsh, but the comments you and some of your co-hosts made were harsh, and somewhat not true to boot.
I wish you the best with your experiment. And I'm glad to see the community so eager to help you with it. Take care.

You could say the exact same thing about "Tweeter", the Twitter clone you invented and added some minor improvements to. But are people willing to switch over to your site/service for those improvements? Not likely. You could hammer away at them daily regarding how much better your service is, but if not many people are using it, you're incredibly unlikely to gain traction.
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:42:44
True, you don't need blockchain to make wallet, but I suggest doing so in order to test the wallet by sending and receiving from it so that there's no doubt everything works fine. I would never personally send large value in coin to a cold storage wallet without doing so.
But you are 100% correct, that's good to mention.

No matter what "crash" we have had, the value has only risen higher... EVERY TIME--without fail.
Knowing that, how is holding not good advice?
Why are you basically advocating to noobies--who already don't know what they're doing--that they should be selling.. and then buying... and then probably selling again because.. you made another blog post next month.... and basically telling them that they should become some pro daytrader?
@_date: 2013-11-06 10:21:00
What a great realization. 
Thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:40:52
Well, if you were planning on holding--which is the best advice there is--it wouldn't matter one bit when you actually would have received them. The price would have been locked in, and you would have gotten them in ~6 days.
To be honest, I think the having to wait is a good "feature" for noobies so they **can't** sell.
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:43:02
