Cool, it's neat to see this getting out there! As of now I have three copies of the braille whitepaper left, but tomorrow I'm going to make some calls and see if I can get an on-demand production process set up somewhere so more copies can be produced and distributed more efficiently.
Also still working on IcyWallet, but progress is a little slow with a lot going on at work. Getting ready to take some time off for the holidays, though, so I hope to get a solid build out there within the next couple of weeks!

I think I'll have something that can be run safely within the next week or so, and I'm aiming for the full Pi-compatible version by the end of the month.

I'm working on a project called IcyWallet intended for this exact purpose. Development has been a bit slow (I have a super busy full-time job) but I'm making progress. It's intended to run on an air-gapped Raspberry Pi, which boots directly to an audio-based interface that handles seed/wallet generation in a manner that's especially friendly to people who are visually impaired. I'm also working on a parallel web interface for people who prefer to use their own screen reader.

It reads each word and spells them, too ("nose" is a BIP39 word, but "knows" isn't, and they sound identical... and there are several homophones like that on the word list). But before issuing a seed, there's a nice warning about the importance of security, and it suggests using headphones and making sure that the user is capturing their seed words in a safe way. There's also the option of using a [refreshable braille display]( which would let the user read their seed words and literally cover them up with their fingers at the same time (pretty secure!). :-)

A few reasons:
* Node has some really nice packages that lend themselves well to creating a simple, primarily text-driven UI (something that is key for this wallet)
* The [BitcoinJS]( library is very well-established, and pretty awesome; it's a solid anchor point for the Bitcoin/crypto part of the project
* I thought it would be nice to use a more popular language in hopes of attracting more contributors and making it easy for people to do their own thing with the code
Of course at the moment there isn't really any code in the repo (it's still too much of a mess at the moment), but I'm planning to put an early working build out there within the next few days.

Hi, IcyWallet developer here! :) Yes, it's a Raspberry Pi, but the software could run on pretty much anything in theory. I'm just tailoring it for the Pi because I think it makes for a convenient (and inexpensive) airgapped computer for cold storage. Let me know if you have any other questions!
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:54:28
It's a great question. I'm not blind, so I can't speak from experience, but from what I understand most blind folks use hot wallets on mobile phones or other wallets that work with screen readers like the one that Blockchain.info offers.
In IcyWallet's case, there's less of an emphasis on spending/sending (as it's intended to be cold storage), but it will be possible to send coins by following the usual airgapped cold storage process (create the transaction on a live box, have IcyWallet sign the transaction offline, and then broadcast the signed transaction on the live box).
Blind people can do all of this with the use of screen readers and/or refreshable braille displays. Copy and paste is always a good way to go, so there shouldn't ever be a need to type out a full Bitcoin address (just like most sighted people would probably never do either).

Probably not a large audience, but I'm still happy to devote some of my spare time to giving that group a really nice, text/audio-focused UI for safe cold storage.
I'd still do it even if it were for just two people.

I have no doubt that if you put your mind to it, you'll definitely Finnish it. (sorry, I know it's the worst pun ever, but I couldn't resist)
The idea of being able to create new words is fascinating. That makes the project especially exciting!
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:48:38
There are lists [here]( and [here]( and then there's another project page [here]( that appears to be tracking a broader multi-lingual effort.
I wish you success in translating it to Finnish!

Thanks! Speaking of preservation, I believe the Library of Congress has a process for accepting and preserving Braille works, so I'm going to look into what it takes to make that happen.
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:01:18
I can't thank you enough! Thanks for making this happen!

There are a few audio versions floating around out there (on YouTube in particular), and those are great options for blind or visually impaired folks who have no alternative access to the information. But those versions don't consistently cover the numerous technical diagrams throughout the whitepaper, so I feel like anyone who only gets an audio version is missing out on the opportunity to really consume all of the info in the document. I'm really excited that the American Printing House for the Blind has the resources to produce tactile versions of the diagrams and replicate the full experience here.

Thank you! Keep an eye on the project page and I'll share ongoing updates there. :-)

Just wanted to let you know that the request form is now live, [here]( It may be a while before things are finished and copies are ready to ship, but you're welcome to jump into the queue now!
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:04:16
That's awesome that Australia offers services like that. We have similar laws here in the USA that are designed to protect the rights of disabled individuals, though I don't believe there's any assistance or subsidizing of accessibility accomodations. (In other words, if someone needs a copy of something in Braille to do their work, it's up to the company to pay for it.)

I'm so glad to hear that you'll personally benefit from this project! I'm aiming to have the request form up later today, so stay tuned and I'll let you know when you can order a copy. (It might be a while before the APH has everything transcribed and produced, since I'm in the early stages of working through all of that, but I can definitely start to take "pre-orders" now.)

Wow! Thank *you* for helping to make Bitcoin more accessible to people with visual impairments! ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ ⠃⠗⠇

Thank you so much!

I'm glad that this will help you!

Thanks! I wasn't expecting much (if any) response, and I'm still shocked that after just a few hours we now have enough to make this happen. This community is amazing.
