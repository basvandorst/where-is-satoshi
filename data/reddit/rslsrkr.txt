@_date: 2018-07-15 09:58:20
If that is the status of btc in the US then I'm pretty sure banks will attach some of its principle to declare it as an NPA(non-performing asset)

I recently met a random guy in a park and shared some thoughts about bitcoin.He too said stuffs that were related to the black market activity.I tried to explain what is really is but it seemed his concept about the while thing is wrong in the first place.

@_date: 2017-05-27 08:57:14

Thanks to the reporter who highlighted the fact that bitcoin isn't a criminal currency rather usd is used more than often by criminals.

Yes this is normal for exchanges to ask for such KYC documents depending upon the country in which the business has been registered.I myself have used cex.io and I can say they're the best in the business.Just comply with the procedure that they're asking and u will be good to go.
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:06:27
They solved it within 24 hrs.
Thanks but not recommended.
@_date: 2017-05-19 09:11:51
