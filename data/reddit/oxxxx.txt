Just like being responsible for storing cash or gold by yourself. Not a huge risk if you're just being careful about it. That said, a stupid person would probably lose his bitcoin sooner than his cash/gold, so it's a fair point to bring up.

Cash is inconvenient to use and store. I currently use cards for most payments, but they are controlled and monitored by banks, and there are fees involved all over the place. Bitcoin combines the ease of use of credit cards with the freedom and anonymity of cash (yeah I know bitcoin isn't completely anonymous).

Just tried it on gf's phone that has Windows 8.1, it installed fine. Receiving coins works as expected but sending doesn't. Successfully scanning a QR code just lead back to the sending screen as if nothing had happened. Also didn't see any option to enter address manually or copy from clipboard, so seems a bit restricted. Don't know if it works better on W10...

Don't be paranoid. As long as it's small sums of money you can meet wherever. Except maybe if the seller has a van with "Free Candy" painted on it. Then you shouldn't go inside the van. But all the people trading on Mycelium are geeks or hookers anyway so no worries.

Just tried it. No signup (just agreed to the TOS) and a new account was created in Mycelium. Couldn't be easier! Transferred $5 to it as a test and it worked just as advertised. I think this is a big step in the history of Bitcoin!

Well it's kind of unique compared to, say, VPS providers or porn sites in that Reddit doesn't have any direct competitors. So you either buy Gold or you don't. You can't go somewhere else and buy it if you're disappointed with Reddit's service.

[My thread from yesterday]( is relevant here. Even if the initial costs are higher, they could reward long time bitcoin subscribers with an eventually lower monthly fee.

Thanks Paul, but I was just on the phone with Neteller and they've now reopened my account. According to them it was just a routine procedure, to verify my identity. Still seems to be bitcoin related as I've had my Neteller account almost 10 years now and the only time something like this has happened before was when I was traveling around Europe using my card.
@_date: 2015-10-24 21:18:44
Shipped some bitcoin into my Neteller account two days ago to pay for plane tickets. That worked smoothly but I hadn't logged in since and now they've apparently disabled my account, albeit temporarily (I hope).

I assume you were referring to that one.
@_date: 2015-10-01 16:15:42
Wasn't the $1k price mostly due to manipulation at Mt Gox? If you disregard that whole bubble the price is somewhat representative of a consistent rise. $200+ is still a shitload for something that was worth pennies just a few years ago. If/when we get past the block size limit it's (hopefully) just a matter of getting more and more mainstream adoption. A fairly static price is actually good in the sense that people won't just get bitcoin to get rich, but because they believe in it long term as a currency and want to use it as much as possible. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 09:51:59
Mycelium + Trezor.
Great overall app with Trezor, Cashila and Coinapult integration as well as a local market. Smaller spendable amounts in Mycelium, Trezor as storage for the rest.

I'm personally annoyed with all the mindless hodlers here. If everyone were just to hodl, bitcoin wouldn't have any practical use. An ecosystem requires active users. I spend bitcoin wherever I can and usually buy it back to top up. I'm also active trading on Mycelium, both buying and selling equally, to contribute to the ecosystem. In addition I've introduced a lot of people to it. Don't just treat it as gold pressed latinum. It is, or at least should be, a viable currency that you can actively sell and buy commodities with.
@_date: 2015-10-20 20:00:36
Well even if you had an employer who held bitcoin and paid you directly, he still got it from somewhere... Only way you can go "pure" in this scenario is if those coins were mined by your employer. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 05:54:21
Yeah I have a memory of doing this too.

And when bitcoin becomes more widely accepted you won't have to go through exchanges, you can just use bitcoin directly and thus only have pay the tx fee when transferring someone else money.

Is it something you are eXiTed about?

@_date: 2016-05-31 19:15:50
Exhanges usually don't record the day's highest, but the end-of-the-day price (or average, or something).
I'm pretty sure the price was above $500 around the 4th. At least the price Mycelium showed. Don't remember which exchange I had it set to.
edit: Your graph is from Coindesk, right? It's showing the closing prices.
