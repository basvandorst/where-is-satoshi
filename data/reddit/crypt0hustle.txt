No balance, can't send anything. So weird.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:15:20
Thanks for the reply. Here are a few examples.
So on December 9th in my copay wallet right now, I am sending out 0.043239 BTC with a fee of 0.000243btc to this address : 1LqRQgKFDKfm6za8q6esdU2yFYe1zngqJc with tx : 83309d5858cf226c3c0edd360c36a2c0c059db3da3a3582f47df6cd468bf2f80
The reciever who is my brother, has the funds recieved into his wallet. Yet this transaction is not on the blockchain. When I view the transaction in copay it directs me to bitpay insight, which then states transaction does not exist. If I paste this tx into any block explorer it doesn't exist, and if I paste the address of my brother who is recieving the funds, on the blockchain, it says there has been no recieved Bitcoin to the address. On top of this, the balance that was sent out keeps appearing and revanishing in my wallet as if it is there for a second and then disappearing, as well as in my transaction history. I have screenshots and can demonstrate how there is something wrong with copay. This has nothing to do with the mempool.
My transaction did not even touch down in the mempool, but the balance sent out of my copay ? How does this make any sense.. The representative on the copay board keeps going in circles that he encourages us to paste a txid that isn't even real into a blockexplorer other than bitpay insight.. he is also closing all tickets without resolving this problem. By hand i can count 20 people with this issue. Someone even lost 9 btc. This is ridiculous.
Please do not give me the answer that the mempool is too full or this transaction does not exist.. because it does exist, and I'm missing a total of $1500 usd from my wallet which I can view as sent out but unconfirmed and not touching down on the blockchain. I have years of experience in this industry as well as run a business around it. I am familiar with fee acceleration as well as bumping. And this is not something anyone should be dealing with. Where is my money and how are you going to resolve this.
Here is another user who lost 3 btc with copay with similar issues.. no one is talking about this...
Another

Thanks.. I tried this a week ago.. obviously..
These are basics... Like the post says. I'm not a basic user. No transaction found when restored in other wallets, appreciate it though!
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:07:16
Do you think I would comment under my real account saying I do hundreds of transactions a day? Fkin bcash idiot
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:20:52
Stopped using mycelium the day I opened it and it was showing my whole balance sent out when I didn't touch it.. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:36:04
Well, it is a wallet, but coinbase holds your private keys. Which means if the site is down or something were to happen, your btc would be gone. Coinbase is definetly reliable in the sense where they have never been hacked, but it's always good to keep funds off a 3rd party. In my eyes copay was not a 3rd party, but seeing this issue, my btc is lost in their servers, makes me wonder.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:19:44
The fee has nothing to do with it. I could accelerate it if it was on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:40:42
Hey restore the seed in a new wallet. Should be ok
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:09:12
Can you walk me through how to view the address it came from, I was under the impression you can only see this on a block explorer..
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:50:01
Doesn't exist in any block explorer.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:55:57
Hey man I'm actually very calm.. I understand...
But for something to reach mempool it at least has to be displayed in a block explorer. Doesn't it ?
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:18:48
Shoulda got a two tone at least. But congrats
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:43:50
Here's another one who thinks he understands how Bitcoin transactions work. I'm trying to help people in the community. Not spread crap
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:58:26
Yeah exactly but now you're gonna get people telling you it was the fee you sent... Smh
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:31:47
? You're wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:48:34
It only reappears when I clear the transaction cached and once in awhile refresh my wallet about 100 times. But yes I understand that could be an issue, let's hope this comes back to me at some point ?
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:03:08
Restore your seed into a new wallet and send it out to cold storage
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:25:47
Some threads have been closed for weeks. Looks like it's been on-going and they haven't made an effort to fix it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:09:06
Yeah me too, I've put 100's of transactions through.. for over a year now, but just recently this happened.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:13:53
I use green address. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:19:56
So I went, it shows there's a balance of 0.024049 with the address
But in blockexplorer only exists 0.00059
.... Lol
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:39:56
Tell me about it..
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:22:25
Check out genesis.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:19:25
You need about 10k usd to purchase a two way machine to begin. Before that you need a safe good location with good hours who are understanding and open to the tech. Then you need to make sure you have a steady supply of btc all the time. Which means you need local people selling to you, otherwise you have to use an exchange. This means you have to have banking set up as well as constant 50-100k float in and out of the bank / machines / exchanges at all times. 12 hour a day customer support as well as free time to handle issues when they come up. Good luck :)
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:55:13
Deez!!! So many people have responded the same answer. I restored my private keys into 3 different wallets and this transaction or Balance does not exist anywhere..
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:25:14
85 Satoshi / byte is too small ? Are you the idiot paying $25 tx fees? Gtfo
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:27:27
Actually I tried this a week ago and my post got downvoted trolled to the bottom of the list. So I took a different approach and it worked.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:45:44
I'm glad this helped people... I wish this issue upon no one..
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:32:06
Trezor, green address, nano ledger s
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:13:40
I've already done this. No such transaction exists.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:38:41
Sorry you guys are right.. I paid 0.000243 btc to be exact sorry when I wrote this I must have just fumbled that.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:02:37
Why is this labeled as trolling ? The community doesn't think missing funds is an important topic?
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:34:46
Lol appreciate it, this has been discussed many times.. no tx to search in a block explorer because it doesn't even exist.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:57:14
Hahaha been trying for a week in different wallets but nothing.. I'm starting to wonder how this is even possible.. I start to wonder if I even had the btc or if it was even real in the first place... But then I remind myself, if it was me, then other people wouldn't be having similar issues.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:56:33
Yeah I'm not sure, the obviously have some server that's rejecting transactions and the balance is being subtracted from wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:17:01
Yeah I wish this applied to me. Unfortunately I'm not one of the new users who thinks coinbase is a wallet. I have multiple trezors and use mycelium, GreenAddress, samourai as well as copay.. well not anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:35:55
Did that within the first 2 minutes. Thanks tho!
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:46:06
It's not even at the point where I care about the money... This is not safe for any new comer to use or anyone for that matter. I've been trying to shed light on this issue for a week and no one seems to care.. it's not about the funds, it's about the btc going missing and the wallet not doing anything about it for 100's of users... For those who don't believe me...  Check this out..
Then also view closed tickets.. the moderators are closing tickets without even addressing the situation. I think the main moderator there is brain dead.. as he keeps explaining we all need to check the txid in another block explorer cause bitpay insight doesn't work.. yet the transaction is not found in ANY block explorer yet has left my wallet. 
To let everyone know I am an advanced user and am aware of blockexplorers and how Bitcoin works. I have been in this space for years and my company is based around Bitcoin. I do 100's of transactions a day. This is not acceptable.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:43:07
Cringey. Showing off 40k lol..
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:30:06
Hey man I completely agree but for a reputable company wether a scammer is behind it or not should resolve problems like this. I understand the industry is unregulated, but this is just wrong, but there is no user error here.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:15:11
Even if it never reached the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:54:36
Yeah you can absolutely
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:50:09
Prob not. Doesn't sound like it was much. Fingers crossed. Customer service sucks
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:37:17
My question is, will they resolve the issue? Why are they so silent ?
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:10:12
They are now conveniently responding to threads with this response ..
"We are currently experience synchronization issues between our servers and the blockchain because of low tx fees. We are working hard to resolve them, but it can take a few weeks before your transactions to show up. If you need your wallet in a synchronized state immediately do the following:
Send your balance to "xxxxxx" address with a than normal fee for this transaction.Our systems will give preference to this transaction and returns the coins to your wallet. This might take up to 30 minutes."
Removed address due to downvotes.

Before anyone says Redditor for 1 day. This is obviously a throwaway account. I've been in crypto for over 3 years and had hundreds of transactions in and out of my wallets. Yet yesterday was the first time I have actually lost funds during a Bitcoin transaction and it's because of copay wallet.
As you can see above, the funds are being "sent" out of my wallet since yesterday at 12pm. Yet these funds have not even touched down on the blockchain. Since the funds haven't touched the blockchain, means that they should be in my wallet right? Wrong.. copays servers are causing the funds to bounce back between the recepients wallet and mine. My balance is fluctuating btc value non stop, to reflect the transaction before it's sent and then after it's sent. But no one is recieving the btc. If you look at the address on blockchain. It exists but no transactions have been made. This could have been with a large sum of money. People need to be aware. The moderators are not addressing this situation and saying it's the blockchain and I should view the tx in another explorer... But the tx doesn't even exist.
Destination address : 1LqRQgKFDKfm6za8q6esdU2yFYe1zngqJc
The insight bitpay gives me for the txid doesn't even exist...
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:58:03
Would the tx exist immediately after the transaction was sent untill it is dropped ?
A second after the transaction. Was sent and checked on the blockexplorer, it was still "not found"
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:35:34
Not sure I can recommend anything for an online store ! Maybe look into Bitgo?
