Thanks for the suggestions! Im not sure why i didnt think of that hahaha

Who does and who does not have commit keys?
If nobody except a small group of people can author proposed changes then this small group has power over what network participants can and cannot implement.
In other words, they get to decide what this bitcoin society can vote for, even if they can't decide how they vote.

What about when the bitcoin developers exercised power over the protocol and forked the chain to invalidate a hacked chain when some smart miners mined 184billion in bitcoins in 2013 that the devs weren't aware of?
What about when the bitcoin devs released a new update to stop a similar thing happening recently?
Bitcoin might not be a company, but it certainly isn't perfectly immutable when you consider that the core devs have a large amount of power.

I'm not complaining about anything, especially not what your comment says which is not what I thought at all anyway.
I'm just saying bitcoin is not an "always immutable" asset that you assert it to be. Bitcoin devs have literally said they would roll back the chain if a bad exploit in the code was found. Literally just like Ethereum and the DAO fork, this by definition means bitcoin is not 100% immutable.

Once we have sharding this won't matter. Also bitcoin has the same issue too anyway??

Yes they are, if asics are unnecessarily produced and used until they're fried up and chucked away it's terrible. I don't do this with my phone or laptop??? There's no way it's not an issue for BTC adoption. Repeat the process of making miners and burning electricity until they break and you throw them away and you quickly have a huge pile of electric goods waste it's far worse than just usual consumer goods for example a phone or laptop that are used for many years before breaking and being thrown away. So you are wrong.

This is an entirely new proof of stake algorithm all the others currently are not as secure as POW. Casper will be better and you can use basic logic and come to the conclusion that if proof of stake has an infinite cost to attack, you can't attack it forever, proof of work on the other hand has a finite cost to attack. So you can destroy it forever. 
Once a working proof of stake model is made for Ethereum than it will be impossible to attack it forever. Which means it's ultimately better than proof of work will ever be.
This is my opinion, yes. Remind me in a few years and you will be wrong haha

Just because bitcoin can have many outputs and Inputs it doesn't make the median transaction fee accurate for comparing bitcoin and ether. Using the Median is a poor way to measure transaction costs for the "average" person.
Bitcoin lightning network transactions aren't free by the way. It has extremely poor adoption, it forces users to become technically advanced enough in order to use it. It doesn't eliminate any of the negative repucussions from proof of work mining either such as pollution.
On the other hand Ether has proof of stake, sharding, plasma and Casper ffg coming out soon which will reduce fees and also the negative impact on the environment too.
Plus the user is not burdened with more mandatory technical knowledge like they are from lightning.

Yeah cool so bitcoin has no core leadership?
Let's see how well that works out for them over the next two years then ay.
Remind me in two years when you are sad you missed out on all the better projects.

Ethereum, Dfinity, Cardano, Cosmos, or...  Bitcoin?
I pick the first four over BTC. These are copies that improve upon bitcoin design entirely, Ethereum and Dfinity will shit all over how slow and expensive Bitcoin is going to remain.

No they aren't, I don't think you have actually read about them properly lol

Sure, Ethereum fees are currently higher however it is processing far, far more transactions every day than bitcoin is:
With all of Ethereum's different scaling solutions fees won't be worth talking about pretty soon.
Why wait for proof of stake to be implemented into ethereum instead of using a different proof of stake coin?
Well other proof of stake coins either don't do as much as Ethereum or are vulnerable to the "nothing at stake" and "long range attacks". The Casper proof of stake protocol will not suffer these vulnerabilities due to new incentive mechanisms built in such as slashing.
All other proof of stake coins so far are generally not a smart contract platforms or are vulnerable to attack. This is why I Am waiting for Ethereum as they will have raiden if proof of stake fails, and they can essentially do what bitcoin is doing but better in this case too.

Lots of Bitcoin advocates seem to think that renewable energy will solve the pollution problem caused by mining. Nobody realizes that in order to manufacture the hardware they have to use toxic chemicals and acids in combination with minerals and resources that are mined out of the ground to produce Asics or gpu's etc... The effects of mining on the environment beyond just power consumption alone is heavily under estimated by miners. 
What about the side effects of excessive hardware manufacturing?
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:40:58
Wrong! Lol! That's actually that's the "median" fee stats for btc vs ether, not the "average"
If you look at the "average" here: 
Ethereum is way better and processing more than Bitcoin.
Plasma and sharding will make fees completely negligible anyways ??

Cool, I think Ethereum will be more decentralized and safer than bitcoin ever will.
Immutability and decentralization are important I agree. Which is why proof of work isn't safe for the long term. Ethereum will be stronger and more decentralized with proof of stake and also won't pollute anywhere near as much as Bitcoin.
I think you're doing a good job arguing in my own favour here.
Sure you might not think it's about the money and if you do think that immutability and decentralization are more important then you should actually be worried by Bitcoin right now. It only costs a small pile of money to attack, the same goes for Ethereum but it is actively moving away from its own weaknesses, unlike BTC.

“Based on historical data on energy mix and locations of cryptocurrency mining operations in China, we have shown that contrary to the common narrative, the vast majority of global Bitcoin mining capacity (minimum 77.6%) is running on renewable energy,” the researchers conclude."
So due to how most mining operations are basically all coming out of China right now and run by a few companies, this is why 77.6% of energy used to mine btc is renewable?
Because it's mainly coming from a few parties with access to renewable energy resources in China?
