As long as CNBC says it's going down, we will go up. Then they'll edit their articles accordingly. Once they start saying we are going up, we head down. It's an ongoing pattern.

Been looking at a Scuderia....Maybe I will
@_date: 2018-08-04 21:04:34
Just dump it and walk away from crypto forever
@_date: 2018-08-02 22:50:54
Just a heads up! Coinbase owns Coinbase Pro (previously GDAX) not Kraken or Gemini

BTC = DED. RIP

I'll bet 1 BTC that the second you download that .exe all of your passwords for every exchange you have is now theirs. And you'll lose all your money

Bull trap

Are you okay? How many YouTube videos and Google searches do you have to keep open at once?

If dreams came true: a Lambo will be my POS daily for these Michigan pot holes. My Koenigsegg would be my actual prized possession.

Why is the average $4 and it's trading at $17 on Binance? 
@_date: 2018-07-03 23:47:38
He is hodling till $50k. This is determination. This is sacrifice. He's waiting for a Koenigsegg with his name on it

The correction has only began. The upward correction, that is.  ;) 
Edit: TBH, it has to stay above $6700 for at least 3 days for it to actually start making it's way back up. If it dips back under $6700, we may be in trouble as we may deccend further downwards before we have another run up.

Wait for BTC boom &gt; USDT &gt; (wait for BTC price to settle) &gt; back into BTC &gt; Reinvest in alts

So you bought 0.0008 BTC?

I'm sure someone on the darkweb would give you BTC to allow him to do unforgettable things to your prison wallet
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:53:46
Can't wait to see him and all his portfolio manager friends FOMO in at $100k

Never give your BTC away to anyone, even people you know very well. Money changes people. If you want to use a trading bot check out a bot called Profit Trailer. Been around for a while. I own a lifetime license since I got in before they switched to a subscription plan. However, I haven't used it as of late so I may sell it; but that's besides the point. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 23:37:35
Even if they are, their purchases would be OTC and not effect the market price 
@_date: 2018-07-10 16:19:46
Whales set up a bull trap, making BTC go up to $6800 to bring hope back into crypto for the everyday people (You and I). Then dumped for profit. It happens, but that doesn't mean I'm going to exit the market any time soon. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 03:11:40
Because Satoshis are a percentage of BTC 
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:12:33
Lol FB stock tanked 23% in the after hours last night. And didn't they give Coinbase permission to advertise? What else did you want? 
@_date: 2018-07-05 00:35:22
They don't just use customer deposits for credit card loans, but all loans, leases, and mortgages.

They make 15-30% on your money and give you 0.1% interest if you're lucky.

Just waiting for China to wake up and see how they react before I make my next move
@_date: 2018-07-25 19:54:03
Just use Robinhood
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:18:17
I wouldn't worry about it. As long as we make higher lows year to year, you'll be okay. Also, if they were anywhere near intelligent, they'd hold until ETF and slowly start selling to increase their profit margin potential
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:59:20
It means don't open the link disguised as Coinbase. Phishing scam for Coinbase logins
@_date: 2019-05-25 05:31:38
Don't forget, a lot of people will be buying with debt by using their credit cards. Then they'll degen their account and lose a ton of money. I look forward to this. Should be a good time ��
