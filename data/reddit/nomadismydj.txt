will bitfinex guarantee their buy back of bfx token at a minimum of 1 USD ? or will they use the market price to do so ? My concern is that this ends up on the open market, price drops 60 cents and then bitfinex retrieves their IOU coin at pennies on the dollar. A guarantee in the TOS of a price floor would go a long way.

Hello, I am the owner the  suite of bots. 
To start with, WhaleCalls is a set of many of trading signals that either update on a rotation or as something significantly changes. To directly answer your questions
1. We monitor the top three contract holders on okcoin for contract changes. Large changes usually indicate a big move in either direction is probable to occur. To be clear when you open a large or short position on Okcoin, you are obtaining contracts. We have no way of knowing which direction. However you can some times follow the market and get an idea of **what happened**. The source of information updates every 8 hours , so do we.
2. short and long  margin usage percentage is what percentage position the top contract holders are currently in,  It used to be thought that over 50% on either side meant the opposite was likely to happen. (ie longs over 50% meant price would go down) This has largely been debunked and proven misleading based on feedback from Jack C. Liu, CSO of Okcoin. link -  We would turn it off but people complain when it doesnt update after a while.
3.  This is a liquidation.  this means  that price moved enough that a position was forcibly closed and the exchange has taken the funds from their margin requirements. We monitor large size liquidations as means to monitor market action, tracking and fun.

this post will probably get trolled but this isnt a bad idea from a dollar cost average perspective if OP times it right. Every two week he gets paid on a friday - he setup a reoccuring buy at friday around 4:00am CST (the average low of the week for btc). if OP did this through out the year, his dollar cost average for all 26 coin is ~275. not a horrible play considering were at 360 currently.

you're late to getting everything thing you mention 'at a deal' and to be honest, i have no pity for you . Bitcoin has been in the news for multiple years and had over a year of consolidation between 210-240 that you could have bought in at. Even if you bought .2 every week since august you'd be in good shape. 
Your thinking at this point should be 'Do i think bitcoin and its technology are worth greater than the current price ? '
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:26:32
I'm actually questioning this a bit. BFX hidden order are actually on the normal order book, just not visible through normal means. However it plainly obvious if we see multiple 100 lots go through and the price doesnt move or order book doesnt change.. In dark pool markets, the order book is a completely separate entity from normal markets and not published, matching is done via multiple sources of liquidity (aka pools)... has a hangout with these guys today. Perhaps he can follow up ?

if these operates the way other dark pool in the listed space work, i see this as a good thing. Two example situations
A miner with multiple thousand of bitcoin to liquidate. Currently the main options are try to use an OTC sevice, which takes time, local bitcoins , assumes presence of buyers or Market sell , which drops the price . A dark pool gives the option to take advantage of large lots of volume w/o impacting the normal markets.
A wall st guy who only trades in $XXX,000 dollar USD position or it not worth the time p&amp;l wise. Currently the choices are OTC, where i pay a premium or trying to accumulate a position across the exchanges and hope price slippage isnt too bad. Dark pools give me the option to take advantage of multiple sources of liquidity to build my position at the price i want.

Also, the FUD about delay issue is highly exaggerated. The longest delay i had on approval for withdrawl of btc was 4 hrs during the whole evol drama. The longest ive waited for fiat was 12 hrs.

anyone can listen into blockchain transactions and watch wallets if they chose to. i dont have a fundamental problem with this as coinbase is a business that needs to understand certain things in order to stay in business and be compliant with US laws. I do have a problem with them flat out banning people with no other data other then hersay (the MJ related products one).. the LBTC one, im on the fence about. My interactions with LBTC has never out of someones coinbase but out of someone long hodl'ers wallet. I think the guy who got banned for that didnt have his game right in the first place.(IMO)

@_date: 2017-02-06 17:10:22
part of the reason this took so long is the way they went about it. When they first wanted to be listed, they wanted to be traded on the nasdaq. This involves a non-public application process that ends with an exchange applying to the SEC (if rule changes are required). There was no change for over a year so i imagine this got stalled behind closed door. they turned around and were listed on BATs instead. This went well and BATs filed on their behalf to list COIN, their ETF. 
SEC does not move fast on new products. I took almost 10 years for GLD, the gold etf to be listed.

First U.S. Bitcoin Exchange Set to Open
Coinbase Has Backing From the NYSE, Banks and Venture Capitalists
By GREG BENSINGER
Jan. 25, 2015 4:34 p.m. ET
1 COMMENTS
The virtual currency bitcoin is getting a very real boost on Monday, with the opening of the first licensed U.S. exchange.
Coinbase Inc., a startup backed by $106 million from the New York Stock Exchange, banks and venture-capital firms, said its exchange will offer greater security for individuals and institutions to trade bitcoin and monitor real-time pricing of the cryptocurrency.
The exchange could bring needed legitimacy to the currency, which isn’t backed by a central government and is traded over virtual exchanges, primarily overseas. Coinbase said it has insurance, offering traders some assurance that their money won’t disappear.
Bitcoin enthusiasts have been buffeted by the collapse of Japan-based exchange Mt. Gox last year—taking with it around half a billion dollars of investors’ money—and a security breach earlier this month at Slovenia-based exchange Bitstamp. The value of a bitcoin itself, determined by trading on existing exchanges, has fallen to about $240, from a peak in late 2013 of more than $1,200.
“To have an organized exchange that has the backing of thoughtful venture capitalists and investors addresses one of the main problems with bitcoin: its extreme volatility,” said Campbell R. Harvey, a Duke University finance professor who has studied cryptocurrencies. “Bitcoin has been sorely in need of something like this.”
Coinbase’s founders say they have been working for five months to win licenses from state financial regulators. They have regulatory approval in half of U.S. states, including large population centers like New York and California. For now, Coinbase can do business with account holders only in states where it has approval.
Coinbase will take a small percentage—likely less than 1%—of most transactions, said Fred Ehrsam, 26 years old, a co-founder. The exchange will initially be limited to users in the U.S., but Chief Executive Brian Armstrong, 32, said he plans to expand overseas.
Mr. Armstrong said he expected to attract both individuals and businesses looking to trade bitcoin. “Our goal is to become the world’s largest exchange,” he said.
Others are looking to open U.S.-based bitcoin exchanges, including Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twin brothers known for their early feuds with Facebook Inc. founder Mark Zuckerberg .
Financial regulators, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have been scrutinizing bitcoin recently. Benjamin Lawsky , the superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, is working on a so-called BitLicense for firms looking to offer digital-currency services in the state; Coinbase is operating under earlier regulations. Mr. Lawsky’s plan is seen as a template for legislation in other jurisdictions, and it may give outsiders more confidence in the currency.
Bitcoins are created using high-powered computers that “mine” for the currency by solving complex mathematical equations. They are exchanged digitally either for currency, or goods and services. Ownership and transactions are recorded, anonymously, in a so-called blockchain, which backers say reduces the risk of fraud.
Bitcoin grew to prominence in recent years in part because of the ease with which it can be transferred.
Coindesk, which tracks the price of bitcoins, says 82,000 businesses accept the currency, double that of a year earlier, including e-commerce site Overstock.com Inc. and Expedia Inc., as well as many small retailers. The value of all bitcoin is $3.2 billion, according to Coindesk’s price index.
The NYSE invested in Coinbase during a $75 million round of fundraising that closed this month. Other investors include USAA Bank, the venture arm of Spain’s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, former Citigroup Inc. CEO Vikram Pandit and former Thomson Reuters Corp. CEO Tom Glocer. Venture backers include Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures.
The NYSE’s investment was intended in part to “keep an eye on bitcoin as it matures as a legitimate currency,” President Tom Farley said. “Any currency relies on its acceptance.” The Coinbase exchange “is an important step for the currency to become socially acceptable.”
Coinbase counts about 2.2 million consumer wallets and nearly 40,000 merchants that use its services. The company has about 75 employees and plans to operate in 30 countries by year-end, up from 19 today.

@_date: 2016-03-29 19:28:47
two questions.
1.) do you plan on offering fix connectivity through ipsec on more then a test basis ? You're one of the first to publicly offer cross connects but i dont see market volume that warrant colo costs right now (especially at NY4 costs). But a fix solution over vpn would be reasonable. 
2.) i see that gemini loosely used a recent fix standard but substituted in places . Since you're a spot exchange , is there a reason you wouldn't just use the defined method in any recent FIX standard ? I ask because now youre asking developers to write code rather then using a pre written library that works on all the majors.

wire transfer for +5k takes up to 3 business days in America as its triggers AML. Coinbase doesnt have control over this process , it is their bank. Opening a ticket was the correct thing to do.
that being said, coinbase has really done a shitty job with support tickets. Initial responses taking 3 days, responses taking up to 7. unacceptable when working with cash. i dont care if you're still in startup mode.

i get where you're coming from. 10 days ago price was much higher, if you bought coin there you're underwater. if you wanted to buy 860(ish) you couldnt and now price is almost 50 dollars higher. Coinbase gives 0 fucks about price, sadly. Just their service fees

there are many futures contracts that are actually deliverable.. that 100% impacts the price of a commodity (ie grain, crude oil) There are other that are not deliverable.. those do nothing but give trading firm and industry abilities to hedge.

the act of withdrawl is very different from a sale. if i sell the coin to you, report it as a sale. But if i go to the ATM on the street, withdraw 200 dollars, and it sits in my pocket for six months, thats not taxable. Nor is the act of simply holding gold asset (beyond sales). There is clear guidelines provided by CFTC and SOX compliance on this. This will leave you're company open to class action lawsuit.

- bitfinex had two halts.price points which where
   - 1.)746 - exchange was online for ~1 minute , all big sells
  - 2.) 716 - exchange was online for ~15 min, all big sells
- they mentioned that they cleared stops.. if you had a stop loss at say 740-700 and look at the other exchanges actions, youre probably not happy right now.
- their DC provider had them do a data center swap to another building friday.  In the recorded explanation of the outage, they mention that testing had been done,they were happy with it and ran all weekend without issue. the difficulties were around unknown network issues that occurred monday. Being a tech guy,as many of you probably are, the choice to stay down rather roll back to the other location doesnt 'smell' right. An industry standard practice is to maintain two sites during a migration and do cross site replication of data stores and routes until the migration has had time to burn in. Granted we are receiving this explanation from a COO and not a CTO or technology rep so there may have been missing details but still..
- PGP is being quoted as saying "maybe you should have hedged your positions at another exchange" wat ? i dont even want to start on that.
I will say one thing positive . Bitfinex has a history of making accounts whole in these cases. I'm not sure if this time is different but they definitely made good on other massive moves that occurred and broke their infrastructure.
Edit: for the record this time was different. Almost no one I know that submitted a ticket is being offered any compensation

So i have access to a bloomberg terminal and posted this yesterday  the article in question appeared and disappeared throughout the day..even the ZH article was pulled at one point. When i asked bloomberg through my account rep and their publishing contact, they would not acknowledge whether the article was false or not only that it was edited during the day.
the article itself says nothing confirming or damning.. no sources are cited in the article itself ether.

the act of withdrawl is very different from a sale. if i sell the coin to you, report it as a sale. But if i go to the ATM on the street, withdraw 200 dollars, and it sits in my pocket for six months, thats not taxable. Nor is the act of simply holding gold asset (beyond sales). There is clear guidelines provided by CFTC and SOX compliance on this. This will leave you're company open to class action lawsuit.

every time this fact comes up , i feel the need to clarify one thing. If you work for , are representative of or have access to an internals of an exchange *you can trade on that exchange in the United States*.  There is a process of going through third party compliance before an order can be executed on your personal account. Your personal brokerage accounts sends a statement to the firm once a week/day.  If you did a trade on the exchange and they didnt authorize it, they will report it to the SEC. Low size trades are fines. If its big enough you get arrested.  The process takes around 2 hours, which is almost purposely done to delay purchases on dips in the market.
the difference is Phil or whoever probably doesnt have to follow this procedure so its kinda shady when he potentially has access to view positions.

@_date: 2015-08-10 16:18:06
i know ill get downvoted here but if you trade on literally any real exchange anywhere in the world via any broker, they already report your personal info and trades to a government body. Bitcoin is special in that it has been able to largely avoid this thus far (except coinbase) and i think people want it to stay that way. I really like bitfinex's approach. "we dont have to report you if you stay in coin and move that around but if you want to withdraw in cash we need to kyc and report if requested. " But if you think the institutional money will be the savior to bitcoin, some exchanges will need to bite the bullet.  thats fine, they can have their exchange, we will have ours... until it becomes illegal to do so.

most of this guys objection are employment, financial and criminal history going back ~10 years. These are the same level of scrutiny you'd get if you were to start a normal exchange or even trade at some of the exchanges. (ie cboe) Even the self cost for the investigator and proof if pretty standard. Where this gets weird is the future business relations and the unknown amount required for the security bond ??? what ? A normal exchange knows what its cost are up front in this process. Why is bitcoin special here ? Business relations arent ever part of the process.

Wells Fargo has a reciprocal banking relationships w/ the taiwan bank in question. In these agreements, they follow to minimum standard of checking and business rules - this includes things like soxs , kyc, aml , applicable finra/ESMA rules. Wells Fargo by being in this agreement , agrees that the taiwanese customer meets their criteria for customer relationships. Bitfinex is one of their customers. Generally speaking they dont get to pick and choose who they work with at this level. They can refuse the entire bank but generally not the customer. 
This is where the case gets interesting. Whatever the outcome , it will probably set the pace for the next year in banking relations in crypto business.

I'm not going to disagree that bitfinex has its problems but your constant and shifting smear campaign is not one of them. 
- People have withdrew USD from  both tether since the bfx token settlement and the usd paid back from the bfxtoken settlement.. So this isnt robbing peter to pay paul. 
- People were able to get hkd and chf the first day of withdrawls, bank statements have been seen. 
Also you made the mistake of telling your bitcoin story to too many people so we know your motives.
1.)long time holder, held from around $1.55, never daytraded but 6 figures in wealth  - basically your whole net worth. (that means you held through gox and watched that number shrink.) quoted as considering yourself a "whale"
2.) sold out during the etf rise thinking price would be a mess and that you could buy back much lower. Your low number didnt occur.
3.) you've been on the crusade ever since spreading false narratives to anyone who will listen. Mainly because in your opinion bitfinex should have declared bankruptcy in August and think they are a perfect target for fud because of it.
The funny thing about this situation is Bitfinex can easily make this go away in short order when their 3rd party audit is complete by releasing the results.

i dont know if its been mentioned yet but transaction time can be a factor.. it can take up to an hour for the money to end up in your wallet. A suggestion might be to have client pick from your menu first, start the transaction and then go shower. Get to the fun stuff once you hear the transaction clear.

so heres the deal - they probably arent blocking you at your local all-in-one router. they probably are blocking you at the first edge router you touch. Next thing, i know it wont be popular but if you have their residential package, they have in their TOS that they can and will block certain ports and manage access to all machines connected to their infrastructure. (port 23 is generally blocked for example). If you purchase their business level , they unblock ports on request. 
RCN does something similar to this, if you purchase their business class (or a static IP which put you unofficially in their business class) they will unblock ports on request.
They arent doing this a as some insidious plot to undermine bitcoin. This is standard security practice. Only allow what you know is needed.

one correction here, bitstamp has an office on US soil and does business in the US which means they can potentially be forced to comply with a legal order. A contract between two individuals is not a court order but i could see why they would want to be cooperative.

this is important and needs more up votes. Under the current laws, they have to insure all deposits , this include "commodity deposits" which by current CFTC definition includes bitcoin.

GBTC shares are not equal to btc price or super moon material. even if they sell 100 dollars over street. the last estimate i read was that 1 share would closely equate .01 btc if parallel were to be draw..  they are a holding company/fund. there value is solely based on how much they retain and profit.

well the real difference is GBTC is a holding company, when you buy GBTC shares you investing in that holding company shares, not BTC. the ETF you are investing in a future whose price is based on the amount of the instrument they hold. in this case BTC. GLD|SLV are the same way . Also keep in mind the price of an ETF does not necessarily line up with the underlying product (though often times does)

This article makes the assumption that these games arent already played in the market. Almost all the tricks listed happen literally every day. The btc community calls it ping pong bots, wall bots , incremental bots etc. There no regulation in BTC so people are free to do whatever they want for as much as their bank roll provides.
I mentioned this in the WSJ posted but ill mention it here as well. Two of the three companies listed on that page I can confirm have no interest in an "over the internet" exchange. They want real trading industry standard tech, which no current btc exchange provides.  They will continue to be involved in the shadow over OTC until Noble or some other up and coming exchange provides it.
@_date: 2015-04-14 15:21:02
My point was GBTC is an etf , "it will function the same as gold etf" GLD is not pinned to underlying gold price or the future (GC). People in this thread and other threads regarding GBTC and BIT have been acting as if GBTC == BTC == Going rate of BTC == MOON!. this is false correlation and hazardous thinking
I know every well that Citadel, KCG and DRW have initial bids.  I can also tell you that Citadel, KCG and DRW have bought OTC BTC as well. Nether of this is reason to buy BTC or for underlying price to pump
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:11:32

lots of people skimming the article and getting angry. heres some points i took away.
- dude had an legally binding contract not to sell his majority share, which he tried to do when him and RL got into a pissing match. Ripple used their legal option to attempt to freeze the funds , which bitstamp complied with.
- BITSTAMP , was given legal proof this was an unlawful transaction they are obligated to attempt to stop it. BTCE did this fairly recently with the EVO coins if anyone wants to draw comparison. They have engaged the california court system to determine where the money should go.
- Ripple itself is a terrible idea, the network has poison pills to freeze the entire infrastructure from trading AND individual accounts. If they want to act as a money processor i can see why.. but if they want to be a BTC competitor, this was a terrible idea.

i think the foundation should drive and fund core development primarly. If we find critical bugs, they should be patched quickly. Ide also like to see bitcoin development as a whole be less of an ad hoc plan of action but clear sprint of work and clear statement of work. ie "over the next two week we are going to work on block chain load and address concern of slow confirmations" might be a statement of work.
i would also like to see bitcoin foundation more represented at fintech conference. the winklvie have done alot of work for you guys but i dont feel they are best spokesman. If you dont have anyone thats great at public speaking, hire a professional speaker/networker.

"they often change their API without notifying their merchants." wtf really ? They are a payment gateway and this is amateur hour. you cant just change your transaction api and expect everything to be great... I hope this isnt true
Standard and usual practice says they should run both versions for a time, notify customers and give them a drop dead date of when that method will no longer be available. 
edit: downvotes ? for stating truth ? if a bank randomly made a breaking change well before talking to its customer you guys would be cheering the mistake and holding it up to how btc is so much better.. really guys this just how professional services work.

for those not involved in  normal markets. Citadel ,DRW and KCG are giant billion dollar firms.. DRW has been rumored for a while to be involved in BTC for a while via OTC.. this pretty much confirms it. However, please take this with a grain of salt. Two of these three companies will not participate in an OKCoin or bitfinex style exchange. They want a real exchange with real industry standard tech like the one proposed by Noble Exchange , not to send money to unsecured places over seas. They also dont want to use Coinbase because quite frankly its not fast enough and theyd have to go over the internet. (no cross connect to order entry/market data gateways).

i was going to post this. Gemini is a regulated exchange , this means they have to follow "obvious error rules" that all FINRA/SEC regulated exchanges do . It usually comes with strict term for what qualifies (ie moving the market a stupid amount). It also usually has something  in terms of "how quickly" the person in error contact them contacts them (eurex is 5 min from trade execution for example).I actually like that they did this . Theres a whole mess of reasons why and when an exchange can break a trade beyond a fat finger as well.
 It also not unheard of in bitcoin history for this to happen ether. MT GOX rolled back an entire days worth of trades after obvious foul play. Most people were happy about it. 
 The only people crying below that its such "bullshit" are the ones that want the amateur wild west to continue... and it can. Just not on american based and regulated exchange. Bitfinex will be happy to sell you all the btc you want.... it just very unlikely that that counter party will be able to be filled ~2000 above all the other exchanges.
 here are examples of obvious error rules: it usually revolves around size thats too large or price thats out of band(options).
NYSE ARCA
etc etc etc

i realize this is but this logic is absolutely wrong and shouldnt be accepted. When you take customer money, there is an expectation that it be processed properly, efficiently and accurately. The "it still new" argument fails when you expect companies to be professional, ya know when they are handling money for good or services..
I hear the "its still new" logic from employees at start ups who are about two years out all the time. They are usually immature (children) who have no concept of how to ship a working product. Thats why they end up getting consultants who will make five figures a week to fix their mistakes.
Before i go full pitchfork mode, ide like to read a response from bitpay and not just "some guy" though.
@_date: 2015-03-20 16:51:19
seriously doubt there is more then half the original amount still in btc at the moment. Shortly after the coins left the hot wallet there were mass sells across all the exchanges, the amount was more then enough to cover the entirety stolen.  Also if i were them , i would have had buyer(s) ready to purchase the btc on the cheap so they could be moved quickly less traceable cash.

most people in my circles get it, its been in the news enough. The problem is the actual utility of the thing. In its main use case as a facility of payment, it takes up to  40 minutes to send coin from address a to address b. Improvement over typical banking process, shit compared to paypal ,debit or credit. 
As a user who actually wants to spend, ide have to hunt out a merchant who takes bitcoin. Lets say that 1:5000 in my City and probably means they are using Stripe. Ok cool, its still a bolt on process from their normal method and often uninformed staff making the process difficult. Ok so easy problem to solve right , find an ATM. In my city there are a total of 9 of them and they have a 12% - 20% mark up for cash...bad deal really.
From a merchants perspective, there are no big chain POS systems that allow you to seamlessly take bitcoin. More over, there are no mainstream POS systems that are willing to counter party bitcoin for clearance (like you have in credit) w/ the exception of maybe quicken... which has under 2% of the market. So as a merchant you have to use stripe (which isnt mainstream compared to other vendors) or you have to use a company that's in start up mode.
As a trader or speculative investor, even if you throw out the entire 550-1100 USD range as a fiction written by willybot and MtGox, you still have a 50% loss of value at current value. (44% loss ath of 2015). that doesnt sound like a winning investment unless you bought 170-215 in 2015
disclaimer: dont take this as my personal views. these are from investors, merchants and common user experience.

Hi Sam, beat to the punch on this one. I too was impressed by the front end offerings here.  However, i wonder if not providing FIX or at least websocket is going to hurt them with their target audience, Institutional firms. I know my firm wouldnt want to write new order entry code just for one product .
two things ide like to add as well:
1.) the socket.io code you see is probably left over from the beta, a firehouse style websocket was present. We experienced wierd session disconnect from it however, despite the fact that it heart beat in the background. I have a feeling theyll re add it once they see theres a need
2.) highcharts will get laggy as there more data present, just the nature of the beast. i hope they end up lazy loading the dataset or leasing tradingview charts (like CME did)

the p&amp;l displayed is the estimated p&amp;l is you pressed close RIGHT NOW. if the books are thin, you might get slippage of a few dollars. Also when you take a margin position, you automatically open at a loss. on bitfinex, you need about 80 cent price movement to cover your costs before you start making money

In a word, No. You get one support email and a business day to fix anything concerning funds before i start escalating up and including grabing pitchforks. Most of these companies are start ups and think 3-5 day waits are ok...bullshit. Youre dealing with money in a form i dont have an ability to reverse transaction on. Doubly so for a company like coinbases and circle that might have the ability to withdraw money from my account via transfer.

it a shame you have to jump on twitter to get their attention. coinbase's support refuses to acknowledge any bugs in their code at all. I've personally reported several and only was only responded to after stating stating 'i shouldnt have to service fees to beta test a product' in large forums and twitter, after giving them ample time to respond to the ticket.
edit: down voted for truth. over the last year i reported double execution both from their UI and api. (1 order 2 execution 2 orders delivered), bank hold on transactions they canceled, order going through at the price not presented in the UI AND double delivery of an order i was charged once for)

disagree here. cryptsy advertises itself as a trading platform of all kinds of BTC and shitcoins.. if he is an active day/swing trader , you cant have the 30 min + delays moving coin in and out of the exchange.  Under your logic all trading platforms are scammers and you should simply not trade. if BTC want to be taken seriously as a instrument you have to be able to trade it as such with confidence.
I do think he should have thought long and hard before keeping 40k in it... but maybe 40k isnt alot of money to him though.

false. they clearly say "we are holding it and will issue it shortly" . crypto kids are pissing themselves over ethc vs eth issue because ethc is actually gaining momentum instead of dieing off like its supposed to.

wasnt there a big article about brazzer/pornhub accepting btc a while ago ? im at work so i cant google but i could have sworn ether in an announcement or interview style article they said something about it.

Did you even read the above comment or are you trolling ? This action is not new.. It exist in currency , metals etc.. basically since people have been stealing anything tradable. say you steal 1mil in cash, you need a way to get rid of it quick. You sell that 1 mil to a broker at 40% it worth ie .40 on the dollar or 400,000 total. That person then washes the mixes the money in order to remove any trace.

gbtc and price of bitcoin have nothing to do with each other.. GBTC is barely an etf by traditional definition. the only reason bitcoin investment trust/grayscale has a notion of shares vs btc at all is because thats what they put up for declaration of value. if they declared tacos is would be tacos per shares. tps.

the bread and butter for them has always been the fiat gateway and web wallet. any of their other ventures, including the exchange are just add-ons to make you use their heavily fee driven service.

perhaps i should have said 'perceived and publicly accepted main use case'. It has been more stable as a store of value then many of south americas and africas local currencies.  But most people are introduced to coin via the news or business journals. They point to bitcoin as a currency, most times paired to USD for value. 
Bitcoin makes a great gambling token/poker chip as well. coin for anti, coin for payout. this isnt btc's main use case ether but i know plenty of people who only use it as such.

this was my thought as well. When you're handling money you dont get to say "we missed it. sorry" . It a shame that you literally have to cause a social media shit storm to get real responses from some of these companies.

Sup fellow nomad. someone sent me to this post thinking that you were me. Coinbase has been clamping down on their account limits.. I used to be able to pull 10k out at at time without an issue. Now it seems like anything over 1500 gets flagged for review.. Considered coinbase was the origin of my most of my funds getting into bitcoin/exchanges this seems really silly to me but..

two important things i thought people needed to see regarding pricing:
* "The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to track the price of bitcoin, as 
measured by the spot price at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time "
* "At the Evaluation Time, the Administrator will value the bitcoin held by the Trust using 
the Gemini Exchange Spot Price or such other publicly available price as the Sponsor in good 
faith may deem fairly represents the fair market value of the Trust’s bitcoin. In the event that the 
Sponsor determines that the Gemini Exchange Spot Price is not an appropriate basis for 
evaluation of the Trust’s bitcoin, the Sponsor will instruct the Administrator to use the spot price 
of the itBit bitcoin exchange (the “itBit Exchange”) as an alternative basis for calculating the 
Trust’s NAV. The itBit Exchange is operated by the itBit Trust Company, LLC, a New York 
State-chartered limited liability trust company that, like the Gemini Exchange, operates under the 
direct supervision and regulatory oversight of the NYSDFS. Any determination that the Gemini 
Exchange Spot Price is unavailable or otherwise not an appropriate basis for calculating the 
Trust’s NAV would be based upon extraordinary criteria in which the operation of Gemini 
Exchange is disrupted or otherwise experiencing material calculation or reporting irregularities. 
If the Sponsor determines in good faith that neither the Gemini Exchange Spot Price nor the spot 
price on the itBit Exchange is reliable for calculating the Trust’s NAV on a particular Business 
Day, including but not limited to situations where it does not reflect material events occurring 
between the time of calculation of such Gemini Exchange Spot Price or the spot price on the 
itBit Exchange and the time the Trust’s Shares are valued, bitcoin will be valued using fair 
market value pricing as determined in good faith by the Sponsor and calculated by the 
Administrator under procedures established in the Trust Servicing Agreement. Determining the 
48  
fair market value of bitcoin involves the consideration of a number of subjective factors and thus 
the prices for bitcoin may differ from the Gemini Exchange Spot Price or the spot price on the 
itBit Exchange. The Sponsor may consider the market price for bitcoin on other Bitcoin 
Exchanges, or in other forums for which bitcoin prices are published publicly. Neither the 
Administrator nor the Sponsor shall be liable to any person for the determination that the Gemini 
Exchange Spot Price or an alternative basis for a fair market value of bitcoin is not appropriate as 
a basis for calculation of the Trust’s NAV provided that such determination is made in good 
faith. "
tl;dr - price is snapped at NYC close. Pricing candidate including (preferenced) Gemini or ITBIT. But may consider outside exchanges if the admin doesnt thing this reflect fair market value.  
  &amp;nbsp;
  we think of End of Day or EoD at 00:00 UTC because we are a 24hr market. they are effectively shaving 4 hours of price action off the price every day. we all know about the price action when china wakes up.  
  My other personal issue is that the language put a preference on two exchanges which do under 1% the total daily transaction volume in bitcoin. They had pitched using their index price, the winkdex, originally to price the asset, which included bitfinex and other majors.  ( but its not mentioned anywhere in this filing.

at the risk of sounding like a troll, 71 inputs is actually alot. are you comfortable talking about how you arrived at that ? I also had a hard time duplicating the estimated amount, even at those inputs.

 I read this type of thing but then on every major trading show or NEWS Site  including bbg, wsj, and rtrs make heavy reference. TA is about interpretation though... so you can be wrong .

this is the best advise. i would send them a certified letter explaining your intention to report the inability to help you with the Better business better business bureau and the california states attorney and file a police report with both your local police and SF police dept with in 7 days of confirmation the letter unless they refund or apply your funds.
at 200k , i would have an attorney do this but i have personally one myself on a bank tx that went MIA (unrelated to crypto)
@_date: 2017-06-27 23:51:30
false. it matters if you file with the state attorney because thats the first place theyll turn you to instead of helping you directly
edit:downvoted for being correct on easily googlable info

AH so that what happened, you tumbled it a bit , increasing the inputs, therefore increasing validation work required. that make sense. $85 bucks still seems really high vs that number of inputs but ill leave it be... thanks for the response.

they made a simple to use interface for noobs at a time where none existed and have straight in and out bank transfers .. again at time when no other solution existed. their make huge cuts on their tx fees there.. the exchange was a hail marry to keep coin in their networks and capitalize upon them.  They still offer leaps and bounds above their other main competitor (ie circle)

CSW was proven not to be the creator of bitcoin.. other than that. will be intresting to see how it shakes out.  nchain pool running completely uncapped will segregate its hash power from teh rest of the network. Current bitcoin and BU implementation will reject blocks larger than they are designed to work w/ on connect.
