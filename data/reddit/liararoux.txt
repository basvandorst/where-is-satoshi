This is good to know. While a regular bank will do the same thing, using Coinbase is probably a bit more suspicious to the gov than making regular cash deposits - which we already have to be careful about.
Do you have any recommendations on exchanges that will raise the fewest eyebrows?

Thanks, I'll check these out. I'm definitely a little out of date, seeing as I did most of my major bitcoin research five or so year ago. I'm planning on writing a more advanced post once I've had an opportunity to play around with these and see how they work.

I'm also curious about this lol

Post-writer here!
I don't profess to be an expert on cryptocurrency; my expertise obviously lies elsewhere. My immediate purpose was to help people make rent as quickly as possible after a draconian change in policy from three major credit card companies. I really appreciate your input and hope to iterate on it in the post. 
Coinbase is not an ideal solution, but I recommended it because of how easy to use it is. Since putting up the post, I've had people email me questions like "Can I put bitcoins on my phone?" Many people do not have any idea at all what bitcoins are and many sex workers are a part of this group. For people who need to make rent (yesterday) usability is key, and unfortunately slight deficits in privacy are offset by their immediate need. It's still a lot safer than working on the street and definitely a lot more private than using credit cards. (If LE has stooped to the point of sending letters, it kinda indicates that they had trouble following the credit card trail in the first place, let alone block chain analysis - your mileage may vary wrt your wife's divorce attorney)
I don't use Coinbase myself, but it is significantly more secure than many of the methods sex workers use to accept payment. Paypal and Square, most notably, have been known to seize thousands and thousands of dollars after accusing users of selling sexual services. I do think it is a viable option for people, especially if they are camgirls, pro dommes, or other sex workers who may have trouble accepting other forms of online payment.

Seizing money aside, Paypal is especially awful about privacy; they've been known to reveal details like full legal names to clients. Coinbase is a huge step up, even if there's an off chance that your account may be frozen. That being said, it's really good to know that account closings are a possibility with them, thanks.

Huh, I've been having weird issues with it - the app will crash frequently as I'm navigating it. Maybe it's because I'm using a iPhone?

Mmmm, thanks!!

Ooo, this one is new right? I'll check it out, thanks! Do you happen to use it on iphone or android?

Should have made it clear I'm looking for a hot wallet, not cold storage or hardware wallet. Thank you all so much for your suggestions &lt;3
