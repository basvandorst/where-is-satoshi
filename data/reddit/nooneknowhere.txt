Inflationary fiat slave money is going nowhere. Things will still be valued relative to that inflationary bullshit fiat dollar or yuan etc. So while bitcoin is a safe place to park your wealth you can still reap the benefits of the greedy fiat monopoly money loans and what not. 
If there is a smart investment which makes sense, sure I will use my bitcoin to do that to build and grow factories and what not. Yet it will not be a requirement to invest in a failing system to protect my wealth. There is no worries of eroding wealth with bitcoin. 
It is a good layer on top of the fiat system, investments can and of course will still be made as people are greedy and seek greater/faster/capitalistic type return or seek to do something with their wealth... Like say perhaps build a satoshi church ⛪
But basically, have no fear... Deflationary greatness will not effect the value of things being worth more and more (or less ? ��) in USD printing press terms... House values rising in cash prices due to inflation is still to be expected. The glorious bitcoin layer will co exist for a long time to come I imagine

If you have risen from nothing into something once again, and choose to be apart of the system, then you should pay taxes. Taxes fund the roads, the police, the military, the infrastructure which allowed bitcoin to be created. Its okay to pay the tax man when you go from BTC back to cash. Don't give them a satoshi, they prefer their shit fiat cash anyway :\)

It makes sense, NOW, to invest in bitcoin. It will always make sense to do so. It is a level playing field NOW where people arent paid in monopoly money with crazy debt. It is a global currency that will rise(and fall at times) inevitably. Putting my money every week in Bitcoin is the safest and possibly smartest investment currently with major rise still yet to come. It empowers people who wish to save and grow and not be driven by greed and consumerism. Praise Satoshi for giving people a glorious weapon to strike at greedy scum in this world that has been taught to be greedy.

Worried about inflation? Quick invest it with bankers who can print money at will and the fiat system is powerless to control their ability to decimate the economy and bail out their bullshit debt. 
21 million bitcoin. Noone is going to fucking print any more bitcoin money and devalue my savings and force me to invest in a broken system.

Certainly I wouldnt sell my soul for a loan and encourage a banking system that inflates housing prices and demand and doesnt build enough houses for people to keep the bullshit system going. Build more houses via automation, grow, and or die under the weight of your fucking greedy loans.
