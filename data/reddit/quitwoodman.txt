Will that even be worthwhile for miner to continue , because I believe the community is working on lower fees for transactions ?

Wow. I just started looking into Bitcoin. Relax

I personally do not see mass adoption of bitcoin, if someone is paying like 10-20 percent for a transaction. Credit card processing is way cheaper.

Yah, I’ve only heard of it. I’ll look into it.

Does everyone here expect bitcoin to keep going up?

Another question: So when a miner is mining, is it confirming transaction and looking for new block at the same time? Or do they pick one or the others. 
Currently a block has 12.5 bitcoin, I’m assuming no one gets rewarded with 12.5 coin all at once. You get paid partially along the way ?

Can someone clear this up for me. Bitcoin miners essentially confirm transaction on the blockchain and they are rewarded with money(bitcoin).
So what happens when all the coins are mined? Does the blockchain still get verified somehow?

If I withdraw bitcoin from my Coinbase, does the IRS assume it as a sell?

How safe is Coinbase Wallet for storing bitcoin  outside of the exchange?
@_date: 2019-08-31 17:47:06
Okay, I will look into hardware wallets. Transferring to wallet has a tiny fee is that correct ?
@_date: 2019-08-25 14:38:26
Okay, Thanks
@_date: 2019-08-31 17:28:46
There is a wallet app that was created by Coinbase. It a separate thing from the exchange.

Can you explain what you mean as “file some amount of crypto” ? If I haven’t sold or use any, I wouldn’t be able to file right ?

Where the best place to buy bitcoin. When you are doing dca.
@_date: 2019-08-31 17:35:40
Yup I got a 12 word seed recovery.
@_date: 2019-12-26 22:53:16
Why not both ?

Didn’t hash rate decreased dramatically?
