Armory Backup is different. Depend of course how you backed it up. I didn't use armory for years, but it is as far I remember connected to bitcoin core and this is where the blockchain is fully downloaded. How many days are you behind?

You can HODL, SODL or ask if you should. I HODL since 2012

Circle can do that. Maybe coinbase. I don't think blockchain can do that.

Bitcoin is always on a public ledger. You will never be anonymous. Breadwallet is one of the best wallets on iOS. The HD feature makes it more "anonymous" as none HD wallets.

Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet, you will have 12 words what backing up your wallet. Everything you receive bitcoin, a new receivers address will be generated in your wallet. When you send money, money will be send to the specific address. The remaining amount send to a new HD address. Much more anonymity this way.

Shit, I missed that opportunity

Do not use cryptsy!!!! 
Never invest more as you can afford to lose!
Good coins: everyone would tell you the own favorite coin. Maybe also the coins he is bag holding.
Buy bitcoin to play it safe, gamble on coins what could make it. 
Doge is fun!

Cryptsy warnings are up since weeks. Why would you leave this much on them?
