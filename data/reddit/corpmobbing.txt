I saw that and once their options trading is up and running the kracken and my TD accounts are getting closed. I use robin hood to buy unleveraged stock. If they start to offer leveraged accounts. Watchout. For a day trader 8 dollars a trade adds up fast. As taking loses is a regular thing. Adding commish to that is costing sum $1000 a month.

Well if it tells you anything about the resolve of bitcoin. coinbase couldn't process the transactions fast enough. which brings all to the reality that it just isn't authenticating fast enough. This highlights bitcoins true limitations.

Debating whether or not I want to cash in .05 bitcoin to buy new Pirelli's after I burnt mine off last night. My neighbors hate me. Doesn't matter i'm moving out of this neighborhood.These plebs gawk at me everyday like they've never seen a McClaren before. Life is moving fast. It passes them by everyday but not for long because i'm selling this POS and getting that condo.

Neither of them have intrinsic value. They're both fiat currencies the gold standard is dead, the silver notes are gone and the petro dollar was just a way for people to try to justify it was tied to a commodity. However The money that the Fed uses to buy Treasury securities has not existed before, but it does have value, because the Treasury securities that the Fed receives and holds in trust, as collateral for the new money it has created and put into circulation, has value. Ironically, when the Fed buys Treasury securities, it does not have to print money to buy them. Instead, the Fed issues a credit to the banking institutions and records the transactions by placing the value of the Treasury securities on its balance sheet. The banking institutions treat the credit just like money, even though no actual cash has been printed.
This process is guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. This, in turn, means that the entire U.S. banking system is dependent upon the ability and willingness of U.S. taxpayers to honor the financial obligations that are implemented by the Fed. 
Is it the ideal system? Probably not, but i'm not going to sit around trying to create crypto's and try to undermine the system. Do i like? Do i have choice? But to assume that the crypto way is the answer to government control and all people will go away from paper money. It's not happening.

I'll never say never but really that is outlandish. Next they'll be excepting puzzle pieces other crypto's? i mean that is truly a threat to national security. More important, the U.S. government needs to control the value of the dollar for two critical reasons: to manage the competitiveness of its exports and to ensure that it can always roll over the enormous U.S. national debt. Thus, the United States has good reason to fight tooth and nail to kill any digital currency that competes with the dollar. Unfortunately I must admit.Aside from full out anarchy and a collapse of the united states government. I believe it is not wise for the united states to do such a thing. Nor do i believe it would be tolerated. I, as a citizen would never endorse it. At the end of the day bitcoin coin is valued in a base currency. Dollars, yuan etc. Do i think it should be accepted as a means for trade? Sure?, but to pay your taxes with it? That's a line i will not cross. It's to volatile as well. Municipalities could have huge short falls with swings in price action with regard to US dollars. You would have to get the entire country on board with that. I do not see that happening. That completely undermines the financial stability of the country. Look, i love the idea.I was head over heels for it for awhile but honestly. What are you willing to give up to see this happen? i don't think people really understand what they are saying. It's not centralized but remember 51%. With quantum computing around the corner and the power of a government. Who's to say the fed doesn't build the biggest ASIC ever? Put that bad boy next to a reactor and you'll have all the juice you need to sap the world of it and every other Crypt. Boom game over. Nothing is invincible not even bitcoin. Or what is stopping a hostile take over of googles DNS server? that would certainly put the government way ahead of the game.  That with quad 9 in UK ,and amazon's DNS transactions would come to a near halt. If it threatens the financial stability of the united states don't think for one second these measures would not  be taken. I simply cannot see a world in which it's fathomable while it may exist i believe that to be a day which is far away.

Ya, Energy companies and the government (taxes) don't except bitcoin as a form of payment.
