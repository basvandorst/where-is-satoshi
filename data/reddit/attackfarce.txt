from 19k to 9.5k
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:07:45
This video is pretty good at showing what bitcoin is capable of doing in a funny way!
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:42:06
it dropped to 9.5k breifly on gdax a few weeks ago.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:44:14
That's a good idea!

1. Do you make goat checks weekly or biweekly? If so buy 5-20% every time at whatever price and hodl 5 years.
2. If you’ve held since last bull... congrats your at least a couple 100k aire.
3. If you think this a ponzi scheme... your right but if price goes back to 10 bucks I will have 1% of total supply by the time I die fam
@_date: 2018-08-28 21:46:45
Maybe but I thought the math checked out
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:13:02
That’s just it... are enough people convinced to trust a new monetary system so quickly? Based upon pure mathematics? If bitcoin dropped to 20usd I’d be making 1 bitcoin per hour ; ). At least thats the way I look at this...
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:42:45
If you own bitcoins you continuously collect dividends. Let’s say I had 50 bitcoin at bcash fork, sell at .1 now I have 55 bitcoins, bitcoin gold comes out I sell at .02 so now I have 56 bitcoin. Byteball and stellar lumens had air drops. That’s why I never sell my bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:24:21
No your right, I just keep converting fiat checks into bitcoin so i don’t really give a fuck what bitcoin price is... just dollar cost average it
@_date: 2018-05-23 00:17:22
Nvo has a a decentralized desktop wallet right now supporting 12 separate blockchains. The real question though is if they will be able to implement the dex that they said would be added to the wallet
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:58:11
Doubt all you want from these old people or people of power, I started stacking since I turned 18back in 2015 and I’m not stopping until I die or have all the bitcoins... at least that’s my mindset going at this. You may be older and have kids or something so it’s more of a risk for you...

This is an interesting topic. Bovada is a pretty big sports gambling site. Keep us posted on if you get a response. This may be fishy.

If you have a 401k. Id have a longer time horizon than 1-2years in this industry.
@_date: 2018-10-08 19:45:45
This actually works. You can buy the bonds with irl money, convert tones gp then sell for btc
@_date: 2018-10-22 00:30:46
Your joking right? There’s were dozens of auctions prior
@_date: 2018-10-18 23:17:17
You should probably sell and give to me then
@_date: 2018-10-05 17:25:16
Litecoin never reached 400 dollars. How are you down 90%?
@_date: 2018-10-22 09:26:00
It’s either this or the memes
@_date: 2018-10-07 23:12:31
Lmao���� just made my day!
@_date: 2018-10-06 00:38:27
It was only above 400 usd for minutes... that’s hard to do, but also even if you bought at 400 usd litecoin hasn’t dropped to 40usd
@_date: 2018-10-22 01:28:05
Stock market is all time high now but I spose if government keeps pumping it up nothing to worry about ; )
@_date: 2018-10-03 03:40:34
No, if he made the chart with linearly on y axis it would look like bitcoin started at nothing then bubbles to 20k in 9 years but reality is that it went up thousands of percent, powers of 10’s then dropped 50-90% before next thousands of percent upward movement. This can only be seen in log. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 00:48:23
Aye it’s you!
@_date: 2018-10-08 20:39:59
Very true, bogaloo gold is fairly reliable and has decent prices for swapping, I think they accept both bitcoin and ether
@_date: 2018-10-06 05:22:59
Bruh lmao!!!! That made my day lmao��
@_date: 2018-06-29 19:48:43
Riding it and accumulating more, since now I’m getting weekly paychecks from graduating. Still up thousands of percent and the price is down 70%. It gives me a different mindset than everyone. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 06:01:25
Yes! 
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:49:54
Well if majority only holds for less than 3 years like in the article, we’re looking at people who don’t believe to well in it, probably will crush price down to 3k and be another nice buying area
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:46:48
@_date: 2018-06-27 04:58:56
I promised myself 5 years, I’m halfway there
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:40:02
Yea, I threw in half my construction money, been going to school, so I sold what I put in at 5400 U.S.D. Last year. Now got a full time job after graduating and plan on buying this bear market since I have weekly checks now. Never had other investments. Still up like 3,000% of what I’ve put in at the price it’s at today. I’ve been able to accumulate quite a few more bitcoins through the hard forks, air drops. Example: bitcoin cash at .08 bitcoin gold at .02. Stellar lumens. I don’t think many outsiders understand or do when buying bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:40:30
It’s going to be under 4500, unless etfs 
@_date: 2018-06-11 07:41:29
When bitcoin goes to 3.5k all the stupid money is gone and then we start next bull run just like people who bought at 1000 during 2013 bubble
@_date: 2018-06-28 13:40:56
98%, but got in on last bear market in 2015
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:57:26
Well I didn't know what to name it, It's a pretty awesome video!
@_date: 2019-01-11 11:15:20
Atomic swaps with Litecoin... could use other blockchains that have same network structure as bitcoin, with higher throughput to facilitate the handling of transactions on bitcoin I think.
@_date: 2019-01-04 23:33:30

Is the litecoin version safe? Or is that bad also? 
@_date: 2019-01-06 21:08:13
Highest crypto market cap at time. Had about a 1billion marketcap, vertcoin might’ve been first but was really small marketcap. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 21:57:09
Where have I seen this meme before? Oh ya at least three previous times haha
@_date: 2019-01-07 10:57:11
Litecoin has been in top 5-10 marketcap since this whole crypto thing began. Highly doubt this would make this sub less trustworthy. A good question for future would be confidential transactions as a soft fork on litecoin or bitcoin first? If even possible?!?!
@_date: 2019-01-06 21:26:30
XRP to knock off Bitcoin... that article has autism 
@_date: 2018-11-18 22:21:34
Absolute if unit
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:26:44
Average daily bitcoin increase has been about 0.42% since inception so if that continued for 5 years you would see, 365 times 5=1825 times 0.42% =766%. so 130 would turn into about 1,000. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:04:16
You are correct, as long as there is demand. I mean bitcoin could easily be 1 million each and still just take up 10% of forex market trades per day in volume. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 08:40:57
I was just trying to point out that the number of bitcoin nodes are running on bitcoin core, which is the original blockchain that wanted segwit and to create second layered solutions in the future. Which is what most of the community is supporting. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:22:20
Going to honest with you but I snagged this picture and took the most conservative estimate of what I think will happen. Currently price is going up very volatility but not as volatile as in earlier days. This chart depicts bitcoin will be as volatile as currencies by 2019. But I'd say this is way conservative!
The second comment below me will happen ; )
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:31:39
I never thought of it like that
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:45:01
I'd say yes until it reaches within a comparable percentage of the forex market. And at some point it will once atomic swaps and other second layer solutions exist. At that point I think price will barely budge.
@_date: 2018-07-12 04:52:24
That would be true if lightning didn’t exist, you couldn’t run a full node, Schnorr signatures didn’t exist, atomic swaps with bitcoin and litecoin, litecoin teaming up with monero and bitcoin always follows suit with litecoin since Segwit fam 
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:06:19
You spoke to soon it appears.
Its up against bitcoin today!

Bullish on this meme being shit yes, the price no, if you like to hold stuff for a couple years
@_date: 2018-07-24 05:10:31
He ain’t missing shit, any Person who said bitcoin will go from 200 to 20k in less than three years is a nut job, or bitcoin jumping 1k a day at the height in December also a nut job...
@_date: 2018-07-24 05:08:04
Nigga, that’s the realist statement I think I’ve heard on this sub since I subbed years ago to it...
@_date: 2017-09-27 02:56:01
I figured it was a good thing that he didn't see it as a threat. Gives us more time to grow the community. : )

Would confidential transactions require another “soft fork” of bitcoin to implement it? I can’t see anymore soft forks or hard forks being able to be implemented, no longer enough consensus.

This guy should be taken as seriously as cliff high in the bitcoin world.

Looks amazing! Curious if the rating is on a 1-5 scale or 1-10. And is 1 or higher mean positive. 1=neutral and below 1=negative?
