No, stocks are not trying to be an international currency so the value doesn't really matter.

Banks are here to make money from us, not to help us, some of us want to be able to manage our finances without having to pay fees here there and everywhere and without them knowing our financial details.
I have not used a bank for a few years now, ive saved money and with no downsides at all.

His power consumption index makes no sense, I think we have to be honest and realise that the power it uses is the only downside really.  We need to acknowledge the negatives in order to improve upon them, cant just sweep them under the rug.

I read the article but I cant agree with it, it reads like hes just trying to find a way to put a positive swing on it.
I think that the whole excess electricity thing is very misleading plus Chinas hydroelectric plants themselves caused environmental damage and upheaval on an massive scale, much bigger than anything we have seen in the western world for centuries and the continued expansion continues to do so.
Edit: I am struggling to put it in words, both sides of this argument tend to exaggerate, using the excess electricity is slightly better for the planet in the long run but it is still damaging and its still a long way from being environmentally friendly.
