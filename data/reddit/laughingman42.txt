They don't charge you for the transfer, but it's only possible to do quickly if all parties are using the same bank. More parties using the same banks means less competition, and less competition means they can charge you more overall for their services. Faster transactions through centralization means the users will pay more for the banking services overall.

It's not who adopts it, it's how much business shifts because of the adoption. Spread consumer use of BTC and direct them to Overstock, as Overstock's market share expands it will put pressure on the other players to adopt. If they don't adopt, the Overstock will replace them.

If they wanted to attack us, a FinCEN release that recognises your right to use BTC for mostly whatever you want, and even letting you exchange it for USD as long as you follow the rules everyone else has to follow to when exchanging USD, is very much not how that attack would look.

I seriously doubt electricity usage will shrink in the long term. Miners compete against each other for hash rate, and the only limit to the arms race is the price of electricity vs the profit of mining. Assuming unlimited hardware availablity (not the current case, but appoximately correct long term) each miner will continue adding riggs against each other until the cost of running the riggs is just below the income from mining.

You're not wrong about what a brain wallet is, it's just that you're mistaken about how secure it is. It is very easy to check if a given pharse is being used as a brainwallet passphrase, by making a list of every address used on the blockchain. Then you take a list of passphrases that you want to check if they are in use and generate brainwallets from them. Then you check if the addresses you made are on the list. You don't need to ask a webserver if the password is right, you just have check your guess against the list, so it's very insecure.

To spend bitcoins anonymously on illicit activities, at the moment you need to use a laundry like blockchain.info's shared wallet send (which is likely to be torn down by government intervention). In the future it may be possible to use the proposed Zerocoin method to be added to the protocol (which would put bitcoin at serious risk of being attacked by the government).

If you do buy i really recomend you just dont look at the price day to day. We're in a rocky time and the price is going to fluctuate wildly for weeks or months, maybe untill some better infrastructure can come in to support the new demand.
The only way you can actually lose all your money is to sell your bitcoins when the price is low. i would strongly recomend you not try to sell as you see the price dropping. Hold on to your coins long long term and i think it will really pay out. If not, you still have some bitcoins which are at least a part of cryptocurrency history. Even if somehow bitcoins dont make it, cryptocurrency has made it. Some kind of cryptocurrency will define the future of money.

Because bitcoin is so useful for transferring value without the normal barriers, and storing value without having to, e.g. keep a safe full of gold coins in your basement there are only a few events that could cause bitcoin to lose most or all of it's potential value, here are a few examples:
 * A major government determines that the easy of laundering money through bitcoin necessitates they take action against it, such as outlawing the acceptance of bitcoins by merchants. (note that bitcoin can continue to be used, but it would be very unlikely to see mainstream acceptance, so it's potential value is much lower)
 * A serious flaw is found in the main bitcoin protocol. For example mining always tends toward large pool mining, and miners tend to always join the largest pool until one pool always controls a large share of the network. This is a serious security threat because if the largest pools cooperate for control of 51% of the hashing power they can dictate what transactions are added to blocks to their own standards. Will they retain their miner advantage over other pools if they turned evil like that? Does that matter? Or better yet can this problem be mitigated?
 * Some mathematical attack on SHA256 is discovered that makes the bitcoin protocol insecure (I'm no cryptologist, but I judge this very unlikely)
 * A major government develops an ASIC that outperforms market ASICs and produces and runs enough of them to control the bitcoin network.
And many more conditions I can't think of.

So in the blockchain contract scenario the payment isn't under the control of a human any more. From the moment the "contract" is initiated the transaction is already on the blockchain, with the human entities that are entering the contract already having put their signatures on the transaction. The transaction however is not valid until an additional signature from a computer is also added (the transaction can be crafted so the money can be sent or returned by this third signature, or returned after not being signed after an expiry date). The computer only signs when the contract, as defined by the script submitted by other two parties, is fulfilled. Once the script dictates that the funds be dispensed, they are dispensed. That is the contract.

It's not actually a zero sum game. If bitcoin was entirely used only for gambling like this, it would be zero sum, but bitcoin is used to send money other places in the world, so those people paid for a service. Any sales that mediated the transport of value were a service that bitcoin provided for a fee. The more people want to use that service, the higher the price per coin. If you hold long term you are just riding a rise in value based on how many people want to use this service.

If the transaction fees get so high that no one makes a transaction, then mining is even more unprofitable then when the fees are lower and more people make transactions.

One of his main arguments, that deflation will cause all borrowing to cease, is a really strange idea. Say you want to lend someone money. You offer to value the loan in btc, "no way."

Well he's probably referring to  
You can create transactions that in addition to requiring your own private key signature, require an additional signature from another party before they are valid. These are called Multisig transactions, and are central to the no-trust escrow available through bitcoin.
Where things get interesting is when in addition to escrow services, which sign multisig transactions after the product or service is delivered, additional signature services called Oracles are created, which sign multisig transactions after arbitrary publicly verifiable events. 
Using Multisig transactions that require an Oracle to sign after the contract is fulfilled would be how bitcoin replaces contract lawers.

I'm pretty sure you can't counterfeit BTC, as each address has however many coins the blockchain says it does, and the block chain doesn't store balances except as a chain of transfers, each originating at a block creation. You can't raise or lower your balance artificially so you can't counterfeit BTC. What you could do at great difficulty is reverse a transaction, but occasional reversed transactions are par for the course in other currencies (credit transactions, paypal, ect.), it's a very different animal than counterfeiting (no debasement for one).

They pay their dividends directly in BTC. No matter how fast the USD/BTC conversion rate grows it doesn't matter. Say I buy a share now for 1.1 BTC and begin earning my ~0.007 BTC per week from dividends. Then, in 157 weeks I have earned back the 1.1 BTC I spent on the share. In the meantime, lets say 1.1 BTC has grown in value to 1100 USD. Oh no I accidentally spent $1100 on a ASICminer share instead of $150! Wait but I earned back $1100 instead of $150 so... wait the exchange rate doesn't matter! If the stock price is dictated by the dividend earnings in BTC, then the stock prices will be dictated in BTC. Not only do they pay the dividends in BTC, they make their earnings in BTC as they are running mining rigs to find blocks for a BTC reward. The entire system is in BTC, fiat be damned.

At this point, your only route to use a different proof-of-work is through an alt-coin like litecoins. Cutting ASIC owners out of bitcoin mining would instantly destroy millions of dollars they have invested, and thereby alienate Bitcoin's biggest investors. Besides that, if you release a client that rejects ASIC proof-of-work, ASIC miners wouldn't adopt it and would simply continue their fork of the block-chain. Changing the proof-of-work for Bitcoin is simply not viable.
Besides that, this task you are asking for "a proof-of-work that a purpose-built device cannot be conceived of which does it more economically than a general-computing device" is unlikely to be possible. You can do some pretty powerful stuff by purpose-building a device.

The point is with a brainwallet they don't need to do it "in a reasonable amount of time" the "passphrase" to your brainwallet is a form of your private key. That is, you are no longer using a 256 digit random number for your private key, you are using this phrase that you make up.
What a brain-wallet hacking system does is formulate it's guess, possibly from completely random words and numbers, possibly just random characters, generate the key that phrase would make, generate the address from that key, and then look at the blockchain to see if that address has ever been used. It doesn't have to submit the "password" to some website, who can in turn detected that someone is attacking the account. It simple looks passively at the blockchain to see if it has guessed a phrase that someone used. It can do this for many, many phrases every second and even if it takes 50 years to guess the one that you used, it will guess other people's phrases along the way, and each time it guesses correctly the attacker collects those coins and gets away clean.
Go to Blockchain.info, and add the brainwallet "Man made it to the moon,, and decided it stinked like yellow cheeeese." Note that this brainwallet WAS ACTUALLY USED AT ONE POINT. note the funds were all stolen. This is an actually decent passphrase that had been compromised.
Add the brainwallet "correct horse battery staple" the famous XKCD password. This brainwallet has been used repeatedly and drained by one of the many bots watching it each time. At some point someone even registered this address on BitcoinOTC's web of trust! There is obviously plenty of profit in running a brute force on brainwallets, and because so many compromisable wallets are out there, it's only a matter of time till the brute force attacks find your brainwallet and drain it.

When he said it uses a "change address" he means like, change. Like, if you pay for a soda with a 100$ bill, you get 99$ change. Well with some clients when you send large amounts they make the transaction easier to store on the block chain by sending the whole amount at the address, say 100btc, then you get the change returned say 99btc to a newly created "change address" where you receive the change. Blockchain.info does something similar, but it always returns your change to an existing address. However you will notice if for example you have 1 btc at 10 differnt addresses with another 15 at another and you send 20 btc to someone suddenly you have 1 address with 5 btc, rather than a bunch with 1btc.

They do not work like a prepaid Visa card. You cannot remove a balance from the card without destroying it's security features. 
You can technically add coins to the card by sending them to the public address but it won't change the face value printed on the card so I wouldn't do that.
The idea is that you hand over the whole card as payment.
This card is basically meant to be used as a promissory note, like cash used to be. However, instead of being backed by a debt of e.g. gold that is promised to be delivered when you present it to the issuer, it is backed by the coins being held at the public address listed on the card. The card can be exchanged for "specie" by simply removing the tamper-evident sticker to reveal the secret password needed to send the coins to a new address.
So these cards are supposed to be what dollars were back when they were still backed by gold, only better.

If the merchant broadcasts the transaction from a first client to many nodes, and has a second client listening at one well connected node, and the listening client receives a zero confirm from the well connected node, then wouldn't a double spend be very unlikely? Whereas, if you trust the customer to broadcast, they may broadcast one version to one part of the network, and another version to another part of it.
As the multiple password idea, why not just wait for confirms on a normal transaction? The aim of this proposal is to create an transaction protocol that would allow small face-to-face transactions to be completed in a timely manner without waiting for block inclusion, but also without so openly inviting the customer to cheat by simply broadcasting two transactions when asked to broadcast one.

I don't even want to speculate. I honestly haven't the first clue if DPR would or would not order a hit. I don't understand what firm basis anyone here has from which to argue he would not have. I don't necessarily give credit to reports he did, just hearing from the bureau that he did that doesn't make it so. But I mean he's just a guy, you know? Just because he wrote some stuff about liberty on the internet doesn't mean under circumstances he wouldn't order a hit, there's no reason to go yelling conspiracy yet. I wouldn't really trust what the bureau has to say about him either though, they might be motivated to defame him, if they see him as an ideological threat, rather than simply the owner of site. Who would it be deciding this though? Putting into action a character assassination? Whatever, he might have ordered one, he might not have. I really don't have any good evidence on this. So the burden of evidence dictates that I do not posses a belief he did order a hit, I suppose. Neither should I adopt a stance that denies he would, though.

There are two ways to do it. You can either be up front about it and issue notes, or you can be a popular online wallet type thing, such as coinbase or MtGox, and simply start lending out some of the coins people have deposited with you, while only keeping a fraction in reserve for withdraws.

A wallet's funds are actually stored on the block chain. A "wallet" is just a secret key that you use to authorize the transfer of funds from one address on the block chain to another. If two people both use the same phrase, they will both get the same secret key and they will both be able to authorize transfers from that address.
This is exactly what is happening in the address I've linked. The phrase "correct horse battery staple" is already filled in when you visit  and additionally appears in the xkcd comic  . As a consequence, many people have the secret key to that address, and any funds that someone transfers to it are quickly transferred out by one of the other people watching the wallet to an address they control.
