Thank you for your response.
That's reassuring to hear... however can anyone else can concur with your opinion?  Or had the same experience in a earlier time?  This is the first time I've ever experience it.
Forgive me for my ignorance, better safe than sorry.  Looking forward to more replies.

Thank you stile65 for your reply.  However, I'm not sure what you mean by 'excluding' (how do I do that?) and if it's mission critical (does this mean to save time?)... ?
Thanks in advance,

You're missing the point of a Trojan.  It sits within your city's walls waiting to be keyed open (executed).  The blockchain path is the ideal filter for Bitcoin wallets.  There are a million other ways to implant the key (execution).
Need I say more?

After reading all of this and knowing a little about programming, I know you can execute code from the blockchain with an external executable.  Let's face it, Defender found it, so can a Trojan catalyst.
There is no doubt in my mind the only reason for such code to exist in the blockchain was a test by someone, a first step into creating a multipart scenario that targets those who have Bitcoin wallets.
Sadly though, there will be victims first before it's discovered and blocked.  Virus and Trojan protection unfortunately is one step behind.  :-/  Thank you everyone for your input... this was very REVEALING.

At this moment I'm assuming that a Windows Update might've triggered Defender to spawn this new alert because it's coming up in a few.
Which kinda explains wonderkindel's explanation.  Nonetheless, I like to see more responses about this.
