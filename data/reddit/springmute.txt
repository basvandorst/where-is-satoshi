Peter__R described it perfectly above. Blockstream benefits from people using offchain solution. If every transaction would be settled in the normal way, blockstream could not earn anything.
Personally, I favor a mix of larger blocks and off-chain solutions like LN. And about 90% of the users agree that larger blocks are necessary (so does &gt;90% of the industry). Only a small group opposes larger blocks.
@_date: 2015-12-23 00:26:55
Quote: "So a minority of less-powerful miners and/or recipients is out of luck: they have to beef up their bandwidth and CPU resources or disconnect from the network. This is how “hard fork” works."
Practically every miner uses a mining pool anyway. So the impact of larger blocks is close to zero. Hardly an argument for not hard forking. 
On the other hand a number of things can be fixed with a hard fork and the code base can be cleaned up. There are some more advantages for doing a hardfork now, rather than later.

I have no doubt that both sides want to achieve the "best" for Bitcoin. Their respective definition of what the "best" is and "how" to achieve it are different though.
Most devs seems to agree that the blocksize limit must be increased eventually. However, I miss a concrete proposal here about the when and how. If you agree that the block size should eventually be increased, then what are the next steps which you consider safe?
Isn't there some common middle ground with which both sides could live, e.g., agree on 4 MB blocks? This gives the network more time to grow and to develop alternatives, such as lightning.
@_date: 2015-12-23 01:49:06
This! 
A hard-fork needs to be done anyway at some point in time (as acknowledged in the FAQ). With the current sentiment in the community, miners and businesses people would upgrade very quickly if a new version gives them more space to grow.
@_date: 2015-12-18 22:11:59
I like the proposal, but I am afraid that some devs will block any increase of the blocksize. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:29:46
Most companies and most users seem to favour larger blocks (e.g.  ). So there *is* consensus on many levels that the block size should be increased soon. Furthermore, most miners are in favour of larger blocks.
A number of extremely smart people that are not "core developers" (e.g. Jeff Garzik, Meni Rosenfeld, Mike Hearn) is also proposing an increase of the block size.
In fact, only few people (which are the majority in the subset called "core developers") are against increasing the block size soon. They are certainly smart people, and have the best intentions. However, I believe they are having a different vision of Bitcoin than most users have in mind.
That there is consensus that it should be increased is not very helpful. Statements like "block size eventually will have to be increased" are useless, as long as there is no exact criteria about the how and when. I am rather pessimistic about the way Bitcoin is governed and consequently whether we will ever see an increase of the block size. 
Bitcoin is an amazing system. However, for the first time I have a bad feeling about its future. From my point of view, a small group of people is enforcing their view of Bitcoin on the majority. I hope I am wrong on this. 
In consequence I do not recommend Bitcoin to my friends and business partners anymore. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:35:51
We are used to buy a beer or cappuccino with Bitcoin, and as long as Bitcoin is small this is perfectly fine. However, when more and more people start using Bitcoin it will be difficult (and not cost efficient) to handle all these transactions in a distributed ledger. Additional services, such as lightning/sidechains will take most of the load from the blockchain and settlement on the Bitcoin blockchain will only take place from time to time. 
The big picture: the blockchain will make a transition from a payment to a settlement system. We are at the very beginning of this transition.
It will take a lot more time until lightning or other alternatives are ready. During this time we will likely hit the block size limit and it will become increasingly inconvenient (confirmation delays, higher fees) for users to make a transaction. Unfortunately, some developers do not care about it (see the quote from Peter Todd). This will be a bad experience for users and is going to hurt adoption rate.
I do not understand why core devs cannot agree on a modest increase of the block size limit. If 20 MB is too big, then suggest something smaller, e.g., 5 MB. This will give more time to develop lightning and make the transition period much smoother. And developers can finally spend their time on something useful instead of writing hundreds of reddit postings.

I do not know anyone who is doing this for the following reasons:
1) the number of arbitrage opportunities is rather small
2) as a consequence, if you are doing arbitrage trading you should have sufficient funds in both accounts to make use of the opportunity immediately 
3) 2.5 minutes is still way too long; and the opportunity is in most cases gone by the time you have transferred funds
4) not every exchange supports LTC
5) going via LTC requires an extra step and costs additional trading fees
It might be that some traders did it in a few scenarios, but certainly not "often". 
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:00:38
That is actually what I meant. Most in the "no" camp, actually do agree that the block size should be raised. They state that 20 MB is too big, but I fail to see a concrete counter proposal from them (only vague statements that it can be increased fast if the need arises).
@_date: 2015-12-18 22:05:26
I did. I bought a sha contract with them about a year ago and made a nice profit. 
Problem with most other cloud miners is that they were running with the clients money. And that expectations of clients are unrealistic: you just do not make 100% profit in a few months.
However, 30% profit (in BTC!) in one year is great, as well.
@_date: 2015-12-18 22:01:48
Generally you are right. Many cloud mining companies in the past were scamming their customers by taking the money and running away with it.
Genesis Mining certainly is a reputable company. They are in the market for more than 2 years and are well established by now. I met one of the founders on a conference in person.
@_date: 2015-06-09 00:21:45
From my point of view it is better to be pro-active than to wait for problems and then start working on a solution.
A small increase of the block size (e.g. 4 MB) is not going to hurt anyone. The transition has a couple of month (no rush needed) and everyone is happy again.
I really would like to see some more flexibility from the "no increase" camp. Time can be spend on much better things than block size discussions.
@_date: 2015-06-09 00:00:23
A fixed (higher) cap is the simplest thing. The discussion is already complicated enough and adding a discussion about a dynamic component to it will make things only more complex (e.g. to prevent that the limit is not gamed).

They check which addresses (like SatoshiDice) receive the most transactions (either by number or volume I do not know). The top 100 (aka "most popular") addresses are removed from the analysis, which IMHO removes a lot of noise (e.g. whether SatoshiDice is currently popular or not).

If MtGox tracked all input addresses they would know their exact balance (even with malleability). If they start losing money due to malleability they would immediately know about it. So to speak the numbers in their books were wrong, which I consider poor book-keeping.

"Within the cryptocurrencies ecosystem, the concept of trust shifts from a government to encryption algorithms; creation of money is transferred from central banks to computing systems; the intermediation role played by banks is replaced by the “block chain,” a ledger collecting records of all transactions: People trust bitcoin protocol instead of a specific private or public institution."

Bitcoin *is* a very efficient payment system. A bitcoin transaction costs me almost nothing, while Credit Cards, Bank Transfers, Western Union and the like are way more expensive. I agree though, that a centralized solution would be more efficient.

"An outside actor with enough cash and a strong ulterior motive—an intelligence agency, say—could try to at least destabilise the system by amassing lots of computing power. But it would have to spend a lot of money to do so. Currently, the computing power on the Bitcoin network is 1.35 zetta flops [...]. That is 5,000 times greater than the power of all of the world’s fastest 500 supercomputers combined. Matching this would be expensive indeed."
Expensive yes, but no attacker would use a standard supercomputer. They would buy ASICs as everyone else.
Quick calculation: 
* total hashrate = 120,000,000 GH/s
* ASIC hardware is available at 0.5 GH/s per USD
Therefore, it would be like USD 240 mn (+cost for data center, OTOH they would get hashrate cheaper than the above number). As a ballpark number USD 250 mn sounds right.

As the demand curve is a function of price. So "holding demand constant" is a useless discussion anyway, as demand for transaction for 0.05$ and 10$ is certainly not the same (and typically not linear).

144 blocks is one day if the block time is 10 minutes. 2016 blocks about two weeks. If hashrate is reduced by 50%, block time is 20 minutes and it would take four weeks instead of two.
However, the scenario that 50% of the hashrate goes offline is very unlikely. It would not make sense from an economic perspective. We might see a drop of 20% or so, though.
@_date: 2016-03-03 16:54:17

Also at this point in time it was relatively easy to send a tx for free, which is not possible anymore.
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:40:26
Also the whole argument (of Greg) is not correct. Implying that there will be no funding for POW is misleading. Due to tx fee, there is always funding! The question is if it is as high as it was before, but this is a quantitative question, about how much resources for protecting the network are needed.

It was just a pointer to a small economy that follows very similar rules as Bitcoin. Let me put it that way: miners act rationally in this environment and hashrate did not change a lot. 
If you do not want to have a look at the data, please feel free to ignore it. Labeling it a scam is not adding anything useful to the discussion (I do not hold any Litecoin btw).
I agree it is reasonable to have contingency plans for such scenarios.

You better read and understand a link before you post it here. You can also read the whole story in Wikipedia:

From my point of view fixing a problem before it comes up is preferable to waiting for the problem and then rushing to fix it. 
The block size issue is known for a long time and bumping to 2 MB is simple to do. Then we can wait for segwit and decide how to continue. Unfortunately, I do not have trust that core will ever fix this issue even if it becomes a problem (although they know it is not a big thing to go for 2 MB).
You and me have a different view on this, which is fine. I know that you just want the best for Bitcoin and so do I. Have a nice day!

"When there is a real urgency a hard fork can happen really fast"
Who defines when there is a "real urgency"? Several core devs stated that they do not mind if tx fees are $10. 
Let the market figure out what works best for them. Core devs should not "create a fee market". They are not economists and central planning generally gives very poor results.
If a hf can be done quickly great! Let's go for 2 MB quickly then :)

The issue of limited block space was known for a very long time. 
The simple 2-4-8 route that Adam Back suggested would have been a good compromise, but unfortunately core failed even to agree on this or on a minimal bump (2MB as suggested by Jeff).
SegWit is great. But the technical complexity might delay it. The most simple solution is an increase to 2 MB; this route should have been taken already half a year ago. 
The basic problem is the perception that core delayed addressing the problem, and that they did not listen to the community. In addition to that the behavior of several core devs participating in childish and personal attacks. And shutting down / censoring discussions, which might not be directly be done by core devs but it was tolerated (which is a shame!).
@_date: 2016-01-17 22:47:26
It is not a good idea to react to things and then rush to fix them. Instead you plan ahead and roll out capacity increases before you actually hit the ceiling.
Therefore, saying something about the current level of tx fees is like saying "no worries, it is just the curtain that is burning, the house is still ok".

Appreciated. My view on this is as follows:
1) home nodes can reduce connectivity, e.g., 4 incoming + 4 outgoing connections reduces bandwidth by almost 50%
2) optimize the code such that some information is not sent twice (eg ILBT), this also reduces bandwidth
3) 4 times bigger network will also lead to a significant increase of users and companies =&gt; many more nodes

Basically every (core) dev agrees that 2 MB can be safely done. The discussion is more about whether a 2 MB hard-fork is the best next step.

Luke is proposing this as a contingency plan. In case of emergency it is certainly helpful if the code is ready.
It is very unlikely that this hf would take place, as the hashrate will likely not drop a lot.
So basically I agree with Luke here. Having said this, I wish core devs would have had such a forward looking approach w.r.t. block size. Core completely ignored concerns of the community and downplayed the problems.

We all want to have more time to build the userbase and market until LN or other solutions are there. There is nothing wrong with scaling this way for some time. 
No one wants to scale to 8 GB. All that is needed is a modest increase of the blocksize to allow for further growth. Simple as that.

I live in Europe and this is not correct for a number of reasons:
(1) similar policies and reforms worked for a number of other European countries (which complained far less)
(2) Greece was very unwilling to bring forward reforms and it took them a long time to bring many of them into effect
(3) After 6 years of economic decline, Greece returned to growth in 2014  (this is the most annoying thing, they were already on a good path!)
@_date: 2015-07-14 13:53:58
The statement is correct, e.g.,
Greek people work hard, but most of it is wasted because the whole system is so inefficient. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 13:48:26
Your statement lacks details (compared to what?) and numbers to back it up. German salaries are multiple times higher than in Greek.
Problems in Greece are, inter-alia, inefficient administration, an overload of bureaucracy, lack of competition (many closed professions) and corruption. You should not blame Germany for it.
Europe (or any other country) is in a global competition. Blaming the nations that are able to compete for doing so is putting the cart before the horse.

You have to start somewhere. And allowing more transactions will also make the Bitcoin network more valuable. This is in the best interest of Bitcoin holders like Bitmain.

Correct. What I wanted to point out is that I am not worried about the 75% rule, as another ~24% will join after activation of the hard fork takes place. So, in essence there will be practically only one chain.
@_date: 2016-02-25 13:43:55
Generally agree. 
However, you can also accept that "orphan blocks" contribute to network security. Like Ethereum is doing it, or as described in the paper [Accelerating Bitcoin's Transaction Processing]( by Sompolinsky &amp; Zohar.

I have met him in person and the Bitmain guys are very smart people that understand the technical details quite well. Jihan also holds a degree in economics.

There is no risk this is going to happen. Classic only gets activated if about 75% of the miners decide to switch.
Mining is very centralized. But to give some credit to Bitmain here: it is one of the few companies that always sold their hardware to others and thus helped to reduce further centralization.
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:09:45
Whether classic is a good idea or not is debatable. I think it is, but this is not the point here.
The assertion that BMT is taking any risk when switching nodes to classic is not correct. So it will not change anything w.r.t. "Chinese mining centralization". A fork only becomes active if ~75% of miners will switch to classic. If it does not fork the classic nodes will just behave as "normal" nodes.

The argument from Tulip-Stefan is more like that we do not need 1 GBit for non-mining nodes. There is no orphan-pressure, i.e., it does not matter for them if they receive a block within a minute instead of a second (it does matter a lot for miners).
So most nodes should be just fine even if they have much less than 1 GB/s.

If 75% switch, then the rest will follow quickly anyway, because they are otherwise on a chain that takes &gt;4x work for at least 2 months. So there is a strong economic incentive to switch over quickly.

Doesnt this also help to reduce peak-bandwidth needs for mining nodes?

Isn't Peter Todd's Full-RBF making this type of statistical analysis useless?
Assume that a transaction was received by every node. Then the original sender circulates a second transaction with the same inputs, but a different output and a higher fee. Miners that are using full-RBF will replace the first transaction by the second one.

I get 20047 SJCX for one 1 BTC. 
And for 23261 SJCX I get one 1 BTC.
**So the spread is 16%!**
Edit: this might be partially due to fees, but the spread for (illiquid) coins can be huge.
Edit2: cross checked with poloniex data, the spread is 6.8% (for 1 BTC). Actually tighter, as you should take the weighted value (and I took the bid/ask for a full BTC).

I read the article some time ago. Interesting idea, but after some research and testing I do not expect that this could make mining more efficient. Sha256 is very well tested against all sorts of attack, and brute forcing the sha algorithm will most likely not work.

The miners were shipped late, they broke promises, and the hardware did not perform very well (e.g. their Titan scrypt miners). 
As far as I know, they also shipped the hardware to the client which was performing worse and kept the better ones for themselves.

Sure, I agree with you. You can hardly compare trading volumes of exchanges with and without fees. A more meaningful metric for me is looking at the amount of bid / ask around the market price, e.g., +/- 5% of the current price you determine the bid / ask volume.
I looked at this (though did not make a detailed anaylsis) and it seems that bitstamp / mtgox USD are relatively similar, while BTC China is significantly smaller.
@_date: 2013-02-04 17:46:42
There is a limit on the amount of space per block. The limit is hard-coded and increasing the limit is at least non-trivial.
IIRC the max block size currently is 1MB which should be enough for about 300,000 transactions per day (tpd). On the other hand someone pointed out the transaction growth in Bitcoin is like:
* 2010: 500 tpd
* 2011: 5,000 tpd
* 2012: 50,000 tpd
If the tpd continues to increase like this Bitcoin will run out of space by the end of year.
Technically Bitcoin is [very scalable]( question is what the consensus about this [topic]( is.
@_date: 2013-08-23 09:27:14


That is correct, however, it does not say anything about the total transaction fees. Many transactions with a small fee can result in significant higher total fees than few transactions with a higher fee. And even if not then mining difficulty will decrease a bit (there is no problem with that).


You did not explain why offchain is a good thing per se. Who is the counterparty that does settles all these offchain transactions? Doesn't that mean we need some central trusted entity again?
In any case (offchain or not). Let users/miners and thus the market decide what is best for them. An arbitrary limit on the number of transactions is a terrible idea from my point of view. Why impose a limit when there is no need? If miners think it takes them too many resources for processing they will increase the minimum fee anyway. 
Block size can increase a lot before we run into [technical limitations](

I know one case of "chargeback":
A friend F was selling bitcoin via localbitcoins to P; he received the payment on his bank account and released the bitcoin after that. A few days later the account owner A claimed that his bank account was hacked and asked for the money to be returned to him. From what I understand chances for the account owner A are good that he will get the money back from F.

1) because Bitcoin is still very small; so it is likely not on the radar of their management (even research teams in banks almost do not publish anything about Bitcoin). There are many more pressing things on the banks agenda these days (e.g. Basel III)
2) the banks business model is much more than transferring money from A -&gt; B. In an abstract form banks form a market place where buyers and sellers of money meet. Banks do not care whether they do their business in USD, EUR or BTC
3) fighting Bitcoin is not that simple (Bitcoin is international, de-centralized, and zero-trust). Probably the easiest would be PR wise or from a regulatory point of view to attack bitcoin. Spending tons of money on PR will not be acceptable (a manager in the companies I know would have a hard time justifying to spend money on giving a rather obscure thing like Bitcoin a bad PR). Regulatory intervention could work, but banks do not control the regulatory body (quite in contrast they fight on a daily basis with them anyway) and regulatory bodies need time.

AML / KYC (anti money laundering / know your client) are standards in the bank world and for financial service providers. I assume Bitstamp wants to avoid conflict of any sort with the regulators (or that their partner banks shutdown connections with Bitstamp). 
Bitcoin itself will not be affected, but the interface to the fiat world will (probably always) be heavily regulated.

Now I wonder why people are willing to pay about 4.3 BTC per share?
Very quick calculation: that means a break-even after about 207 weeks which means 4 years. Actually, taking into account that the block reward will be halved in about 3 years I would expect something like 5 years for break-even (given that ASICMINER keeps its market share).
Anyone can explain me why people are willing to pay that much for the shares? 
(for a normal stock a break-even of 5 years would be great, but given all the risks involved the risk-premium seems for me rather small from my point of view)

Very good flyer. However, I think some parts of the  "Wieso macht ihr diesen Flyer" could be improved. Increasing acceptance and spreading the word sounds good. 
Stating that the media is often negative about Bitcoin and that we want to give a neutral point of view does not sound very compelling from my point of view. Also I would replace the last part "lass dich überzeugen" (let us convince you), with something like "we would be happy to inform you about Bitcoin and its application".

If you consider the first step in the Wikipedia example: 
this results in: 
10 BTC deposit into the bank account. 9 BTC lend, 1 BTC kept. That is 10% fractional reserve. 
However, you are right too, if you repeat the process. Then the initial deposit of 10 BTC and assuming a 10% fractional reserve will result in: total deposit=100 BTC, total lend out= 90 BTC (total reserves 10 BTC). 
The "money multiplier" is then 10 (for a fractional reserve of 10%).

Limiting the blockchain size has been discussed for a long time. There is no strong argument I am aware of against increasing the block size to a much higher level. If miners do not like it they can stay with a lower threshold. It is their decision. If another miner is more efficient he will take additional fees for processing additional transactions. It is easy. Let the market / miners decide.
From my point of view a hard cap is not a "highly desired place".

The basic idea is to take "orphaned block" into account for evaluating the security of a transaction. I think the idea is brilliant.
This is the relevant part from the link:
"Since high transaction rates imply many conflicting blocks are created, it would be quite useful if these blocks were not really lost. In fact, each block can be seen as supporting not just transactions inside it, but also those embedded in previous blocks. Even if a block is not in the main chain,  we can still count the confirmations it gives previous blocks as valid. This is the basis of our proposed modification, which we call the "Greedy Heaviest-Observed Sub-Tree" chain selection rule. 
Roughly speaking, since each block contains a hash of its predecessor, all blocks form a tree structure, rooted at the Genesis Block. Bitcoin currently selects the accepted history as the longest (or rather heaviest) chain in the tree. We suggest another approach: At each fork, pick the sub-tree containing the most blocks (or rather the blocks with greatest combined difficulty). Do this repeatedly until reaching a leaf. The path traversed is the chain that nodes should accept. But how does this help? Notice now, that an attacker that wishes to change the main-chain selected by the algorithm needs to make us change our decision in one of the forks. To do so, he needs to build more blocks than are contained in the entire sub-tree (and not just more blocks than are contained in the longest chain!). "
@_date: 2013-03-19 23:52:12
I hear this argument quite often.
From wikipedia: "In economics, deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services."
How is this prevented by have money that is divisible? The "value" (i.e. how many good you can buy for it) for "one BTC" will increase (regardless of the divisibility of the BTC). And this is deflation. 
@_date: 2013-10-15 16:51:10
If someone intentionally wants to spam the blockchain it does not matter if he does it with 0.01 or 10 BTC. Transaction costs for a spammer would be the same. 
Also, it is almost impossible in many cases to detect which is the "real" transaction. For example if I have 1 BTC on account A and want to send 0.01 BTC to account B this will result in the following transaction (where C is the change address):
 A  --&gt; B (0.01) and to C (0.99)
Thus, there is no way to know whether 0.01 or 0.99 were transfered in this transaction.

Thanks for the raising awareness of this issue. 
Bitcoin currently is between 0.7-0.8 tx/second, and the current hard limit is about 4 tx/second (1 MB block size and an average transaction size of 400 bytes). This might sound like that there is sufficient space until the limit is reached. However, Bitcoin is growing exponentially(?) fast and there might be little time before we hit the hard limit (maybe about a year). The problem is that the "max block size" is encoded in the souce code which means that a hard fork is required to lift this limit, i.e., everyone has to upgrade to a newer version (and this will require time).
The max block size was added by Satoshi Nakamoto to prevent spamming the blockchain. However, he also added that the limitation needs to be increased (or removed) later on.
From reading a number of discussions some time ago I got the impression that most core develops agree to increase the max block size, but there is to my knowledge no consensus on the how and when.
My personal opinion is that the max block size should be removed altogether and to let the miners decide which size works for them. They know best how much processing of a transaction costs them (in terms of hardware and electricity) and thus they should be the ones who decide which transactions they want to include in a block. I would prefer such a market based solution (without arbitrary software limits).
EDIT: typos
@_date: 2013-10-21 15:28:09
A higher blocksize limit could mean: more transactions with a lower fee (per transaction) which result in a *higher* overall fees. 
Limiting a resource means higher prices per unit, but not necessarily a higher profit overall. For example, if IBM would have decided to only sell 10 computers per year that would not mean that they maximize their profit. Same with the block size.

I use three simple criteria before I do business in the bitcoin world:
* is the identify of the person behind the service known? (e.g. Mark Karpeles for MtGox)
* is the company at least ~1 year successful in business?
* does the business concept of the company makes sense to me?
I follow these rules and only suffered one hit due to bitcoinica (I did not stick to criteria 2 then). 
@_date: 2013-08-22 13:12:52
* mining always tends to be non-profitable in the long run; if it is profitable more miners will join
* off-chain means more centralization!
* fee increases will result in more BTC profit in the _short_ term for miners, however, I favor 10x more transactions with 1/10 th of the fee each instead; this allows for more growth without too much centralization (and a higher BTC price)
* Satoshi Nakamoto himself considered the hard cap a temporary solution to prevent blockchain spamming 
* the market / miners should decide about the right block-size; not someone from the dev team (though they are doing a superb job so far)

I would guess that we have about 1,000,000 "active" users (including those that just use bitcoin as a saving account). It is all about the order of the magnitude; my guess is based on blockchain.info data:
* [number of transaction per day]( 50,000   (30 day average)
* [number of trx by MyWallet users]( 8,500   (30 day average)
Therefore, roughly 17% of all transaction are the result of MyWallet users.
* [MyWallet number of users]( 300,000   (30 day average)
Therefore, there are about 1.7 mn users.
However, certainly not all MyWallet users are active and several wallets might belong to the same person.
