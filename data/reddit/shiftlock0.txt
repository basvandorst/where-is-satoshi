Ha, ha, ha. That's exactly what a lot of people said in early 2014 when it was dropping fast after peaking over 1000. I heard a lot of "I told you so" when it dropped down in the 200's and stayed below 500 for almost 2 years. I'm glad I didn't sell, but damn, I wish I bought more.

You're right, and past performance isn't why I'm not selling, nor was it why I didn't sell back then. This just feels like deja vu all over again, and it's my somewhat experienced *opinion* that Bitcoin will recover and hit new highs, even if it drops way low and stays there for a while.

In 1991 I was busted for various hacking charges due to fallout after Operation Sundevil. Part of my sentence was a special stipulation which stated I was to have no access to a computer that contained a modem or network connection for the period of my probation, which was 5 years. If I was caught, it would have been a violation of my probation. My probation officer made several surprise visits to my home to check. I had a nice cozy spot in a crawlspace in the attic where I had a 486 with a 14.4k modem. Never got caught with it.

I think he's calling you insane because owning a home carries a risk of having to pay a sudden and unexpected large amount when something inevitably goes wrong and needs to be replaced or repaired. It could put you well into debt. For example, let's say your sewer connection breaks.

It does make you wonder, though, why he ever attached his real name to Bitcoin at all. If the article is to be believed, he's been a suspicious and borderline paranoid person.

...or, maybe he did, and he knew he would never be found if he used the name of an old associate/coworker he once knew who was brilliant and paranoid. Who would ever believe he WASN'T the one who created Bitcoin?

Because it's an illusion of security. If there's something valuable or interesting to be found, there's a good chance someone is going to find it.
I'll give you an example. Back in the 1980's companies would install modems on their computer systems with little or no login security. They didn't think it was needed because nobody knew the system was there or had the phone number to connect. Well, if you've seen the movie WarGames, you may remember the "war dialer" that scanned phone numbers looking for systems to connect to. It was a free-for-all for we young hackers looking for dialup systems to explore.

Let's make this simple... When two variables are inversely proportional, they have a relationship in which the product is a constant. When one variable increases, the other decreases in proportion so that the product is unchanged. Therefore, there must be correlation between the two variables.
@_date: 2015-09-25 18:33:45
Any two items that are inversely proportional are, by definition, correlated. I think you need to look up the meaning of the word 'correlated.' It means there's a relationship between two or more measures. It doesn't imply anything about that relationship at all, just that they're connected in some way.
@_date: 2015-09-25 11:37:58
So then they are correlated. The correlation is that they're inversely proportional.
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:57:09
It's not going to happen by 2020, but I wouldn't say it's impossible at some point. I remember being amazed when the value of 1 bitcoin crossed the $1 mark. That was 7 years ago, and we're at $7000 today. A lot of people think bitcoin is over, but I think it's still early days. The last Bitcoin won't be mined until the year 2140, or 122 years from now. Only time will tell.

As a merchant, what if you use my services and then dispute the charge with your bank? I'm SOL. This is called "friendly fraud" and it happens more often than you know. The liability has to lay on one side or the other, and in general merchants are more trustworthy than consumers, since their reputation is on the line.
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:41:36
Great strategy, if you're operating on the assumption that the price will rise above where it is right now, or the price of your second purchase, or your third. Keep in mind that none of that is guaranteed, and you should only invest money you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2016-05-10 18:29:30


Not anymore. A recent class action lawsuit against Visa and MasterCard resulted in a settlement that allows all merchants to charge their customers a fee for using credit cards.  Some U.S. states have laws which make it illegal (CA, CO, CT, FL, KS, ME, MA, NY, OK, TX), but the loophole is to simply word it as giving a discount to customers paying by cash (or bitcoin) as opposed to charging a fee for credit card customers. Some gas stations do this by listing a different per-gallon price for cash.
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:32:06
Where, MTGox? Because we now know that number was bullshit. The peak on BTC-e was 1095 on Nov 28, 2013. The peak on Bitstamp was 1163 on the same day. Those are both markets where **all** the BTC had value that could be converted into fiat or products.

It's PERFECT for merchant transactions, even small local merchants. As a small business owner, I would love it if most of my customers used Bitcoin, and other local merchants accepted it. First of all, I wouldn't have to pay ridiculous credit card processing fees. I would get the coin instantly instead of waiting 2 or 3 days for the deposit from my credit card processor to go into my bank account. I wouldn't have to worry about chargebacks. I could pay myself and my employees in Bitcoin and we could use that Bitcoin to buy from other local merchants who would benefit in the same ways. I'd love to pay for my gas, groceries and everything else this way.
The way I see it, this is the REAL value of Bitcoin, and it's the only reason it's worth investing in now. These wild swings up and down are insane and don't represent the real value of Bitcoin in today's world. Invest in Bitcoin for the long haul. Once it's widely adopted as an actual currency, it will *steadily* rise in value for a very long time.
There are also features of Bitcoin that are in the code but aren't yet being used. They're laying dormant, for some time in the future when some brilliant person wants to take advantage of them.  [This video]( of Mike Hearn's presentation in London last year is very informative in that regard.

According to the label, a 1L bottle contains 4 servings, so it's for either (1) sharing, or (2) being a glutton.

Camp isn't working. I heard they got his with a DDOS attack yesterday. If you want to see even more variation, look at the global markets, particularly China which is just about to break 1000 USD:

Or simply add a shield around the screen so it can only be seen from directly in front of the unit.  Or recess the screen into the unit.

And that's what this is all really about. The value of Bitcoin that everyone is so obsessed with is really pointless if it doesn't better your life in some way. What better time than the present? Besides, the car will likely increase in value also.
Beautiful NSX. It was one of those "someday" cars for me as a teenager in the mid 90's.

You might want to think about making it 995 USD.

There are a surprising number of local newspapers writing articles on Bitcoin right now and over the coming months. As the owner of the only local business around me that accepts BTC, I was interviewed just last night for an article being published on Sunday in a local paper. The average person on the street has never heard of Bitcoin, and even if they have, knows very little about it, but word is spreading among the general population. As ubiquitous as Bitcoin seems to us, we're still vastly in the minority. These are still early days. Just you wait and see.

Buy high, sell low. That's a good plan you have there.

I've lived my entire life in various parts of the U.S. and I've only seen someone drink directly from a 2L bottle once. I found it very odd, and it looked awkward. It takes two hands!

There has to be a correction soon. This is getting insane. We're now approaching 370 just 5 hours after this "tree fiddy" meme was posted. This isn't stable.

So, if the price changes before you submit your order, you expect them to take the loss? How's that fair? The relative value of BTC changes by the second. I bet if you were converting back to USD and the price changed in your favor before you submitted your sale, you'd end up with a dollar amount higher than you were expecting. It works both ways. Don't cut it so close and you won't have a problem.

You'd have said the same thing about the internet in 1993 when most people were aware of it. It was a thing many people had heard about in the news, and maybe had a friend of a friend who was into it. But the vast majority of people had no first-hand knowledge or experience with it. I specifically remember people telling me it was going nowhere and it would never become mainstream, because I was trying to scrape up the funds to start an ISP. Now every one of those people has it in their pocket wherever they go.

Just broke $900 on GOX just 7 hours after this "Skyrockets to $600" post. I think we'll see $1000 within hours. Insane.

Can't believe you fell for that.
