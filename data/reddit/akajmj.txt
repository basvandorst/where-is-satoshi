Yeah Bitwala is a shoddy operation. My account was immediately locked upon signing up with no reason given or option to unlock other than "contact customer support". Imagine if I had had bitcoin in the account and I needed to move it. Further, I asked for my account to be deleted and all my personal information destroyed and I'm still getting marketing emails about updating my profile.
Shoddy. Not your keys, not your coins.
I personally don't think they're intentionally defrauding or scamming. I just think they are a shit, poorly-organised platform which sells the big story about crypto adoption to get users to sign up. In reality, **they are a fucking bank**.
I'm actually glad my account was instantly frozen, before I had the chance to load any funds.

Marketcap is a meaningless metric for determining the economic velocity (i.e. the $$$) needed to move the price by x%. Marketcap is merely circulating supply x trading price.
You need to look at the **volume per tick** to determine the money needed. A tick is $0.01. The volume per tick is the USD value of BTC needed to move the market $0.01 in either direction.

Don’t confuse bitcoin the currency with bitcoin the store of value. It is more likely to be the latter than the former.
I can store $1,400 of wealth in a ounce of gold. Yet I can’t buy return flights to Tahiti for me and my honey with a bar of gold. Upon being refused payment in gold by the airline, I wouldn’t curse my gold bar and cry out about its lack of utility. I just need to convert it into a spendable form of money (right now, fiat). It’s a pain in the ass to sell a gold bar, yet it is STILL used as a store. With bitcoin, conversion to fiat can be done within an hour or so, while you sit on the couch in your underwear. Think about this.
I think the bitcoin as a currency ship has sunk. The value proposition is so clear to most people who understand bitcoin from a monetary perspective, why on earth would they use (i.e. dispose of) an asset which will most probably balloon in the coming years?

After the next two bull runs are completed, when the macro fibonacci sequence is done, and volatility goes way down (much like gold stabilised) –
if everyone's holding bitcoin, which is itself a scarce asset, the demand will increase because the very scarcity of something that a lot of people have agreed is valuable, is what fuels the demand. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
And *that*, my friend, is the utility.

It’s more than 40x. The 400k I believe refers to the stock to flow price, which as you can see has been anywhere from 10% to 30% of the respective ATH price at the end of the bull.

There’s 190,000 metric tons of gold in the world, yet the free market has deemed it sufficiently scarce to use it as a store of value. The same is beginning to be true of bitcoin, which can be transferred electronically; which can not be manipulated, debased or printed; which relies on mathematics instead of human or corporate third parties to complete transactions.
If you haven’t read about bitcoin and stock to flow, I recommend you check it out. It illuminates the issue very well:

This is the correct answer. They manipulate the spot price to get the futures price down to the lower levels they missed when the CME exchange was closed so they can get these discounted positions before launching it higher again.
Don't bemoan the manipulation. Learn to understand it and use it to your advantage.
I reckon this gap gets filled sharpish. It's not gonna be another gap like 8.5k which went unfilled for months. Mid November at the latest, the 8800 gap gets filled!

Aren't *futures* just independent bets on the direction of an asset's price? As such, each long requires a seller on the other side and each short requires a buyer on the other side. The actual price of bitcoin can only be affected by trading the actual asset.
As far as I can see, for your theory to carry weight, this same "cartel of stupidly rich people" would have to acquire actual bitcoin to affect the price in conjunction with placing futures bets

A quick look at some key daily moving averages like the 111 and 350 show that for us to make a lower lower that $3.1k would take a special kind of sell off. Plug the 111 and 350 daily into your chart, and compare the price action over all previous cycles to see this.

It shouldn't be stored there in the first place. Buy a Trezor and ease your mind
@_date: 2019-09-01 11:24:24
Hypothetically speaking of course, and definitely not advice:
1. Formally give up your tax residency in your current jurisdiction
2. Move to Germany
3. Open a German bank account and rent a property
4. Crypto held for longer than 1 year is CGT free
There really isn’t anything else to it. You just have to prove when you bought and sold the assets and you do not pay CGT.
Please bear in mind since the gains were not taxed in the country they were technically made, the tax authorities in other countries will be drooling waiting for you to remit the money back into their country. Remitting is basically importing currency, such that it is liable to tax again. 
The UK for example goes one step further: if you move back within 5 years of step 1 (regardless of whether you take the money back with you), they still claim the tax. Best thing is to to get a debit card from your German bank that can be used globally and make sure to stay below the tax residency threshold of countries, which is usually around 183 days total per year.
All hypothetical of course...!

That's not what the "bottom" is. The bottom is the lowest point in a bear market before a reversal and beginning of a new bullrun. The current bottom is $3,180 in mid December. The next one will be way higher than 10k.
