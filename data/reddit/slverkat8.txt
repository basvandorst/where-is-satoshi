On blockchain , did you do convert or did you send from bitcoin cash wallet to bitcoin address ? I believe sending from different wallets creates a problem and most likely cause you to lose your funds .

I looked at your page . It’s a nice blog posts. I like everything about it , your contents are good. I just don’t like the name of the page . Lol perhaps change it to something related with bitcoin or crypto. Just my opinion . Other than that , cheers !!

It seems like you got a malware that caused you to send out your funds right away after you sent to an address . Did you download anything , or did you download legit wallet from correct site , not phished sites .
I assume you’re issuing blockchain wallet ? Did you download the wallet from the correct site ?
I also heard rumors about people getting their funds stolen by downloading malwared wallets from phished sites , mainly electrum wallet .

It’s over 9000!!!!

Hahah stacking those satoshis
@_date: 2019-10-01 00:56:12
Yea this seems most likely to be a malware that redirected you to send to another address right after you made a transaction . If someone knew your password info , they could’ve just took the funds and don’t need to wait .

Nice job !

As others have said , avoid shitty Wallets  , preferably stick with legit electrum, trust wallet , or even Coinbase wallet is pretty good , and enable 2 factor authentication by google auth , avoid number 2fa as it is easy to spoof . Again best is to get hardware wallet .

Niceeee !! It’s awesome , but please read some guides before you do anything , make sure to backup and never give anybody your seed words . And always do a test transaction before you send the big amount to verify everything works . Good luck !!

Hm so you’re using android , sometimes you gotta becareful when you download other apps not from play store , could be someone keylogged you . Best is to secure yourself by getting a hardware wallet for large amounts of cryptocurrency like a ledger or trezor.

Maybe Bittrex ?
@_date: 2019-09-02 01:12:31
Maybe try something like :
- government regulations on blockchain/ crypto technology 
- how cryptocurrency will change the future of economics and money of a country
- how banks can use blockchain technology to replace conventional banking processes
@_date: 2019-09-01 05:22:38
It’s cause someone posted a post about having 6.15 bitcoins , boasting about him/herself having that much . Lol now everyone is referencing it .
@_date: 2019-09-26 03:33:55
Haha that game looks fun !
@_date: 2019-09-08 03:35:49
Yea. Better be safe than sorry . I ordered mines thru ledger directly . Shipped directly from them
@_date: 2019-09-08 19:46:35
I got it in about a week from France to California . It was pretty fast shipping from international . I bought the combo pack with ledger nano S and X . Pretty good deal . Using it now and it’s pretty good .
