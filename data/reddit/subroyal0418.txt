So in your opinion what could this mean?  Just the bulls and bears fighting it out?
@_date: 2019-03-13 19:57:03
I don’t have a suitable wallet.

No not really, someone pretty much just said “a practical quantum computer is still like a decade away and by then we will have developed something to protect against it.”  
I only had like 3 comments I can try to dig it up.

Either way this breaks it will be a decisive move and I plan on buying more in either case.  If it somehow manages to move to the upside I believe that MIGHT be a confirmation that the market has bottomed and that a bull run may be on the horizon.  If it breaks bearish then we could see sub $3000 levels and the bear market is still in for the next several months.
We will see.

I’m still voting for Trump but that’s cool.  Rand Paul was accepting bitcoin before it was cool though.

Really?  Why?

Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Mexico.
@_date: 2019-03-06 20:16:33
I have mentioned this exact same concern a few months back.  
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:46:34
I think Expedia accepts bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-05 19:24:20
How is this going to work with bitcoin and litecoin?  The supply for both are limited and their creation rate shrinks overtime.  I could see it working with Ethereum though.
@_date: 2019-03-13 16:16:57
I know historically but this is a very large jump jump in volume considering what it’s been for the past 4 months.
@_date: 2019-03-06 17:29:04
It’s useless to guess if we have hit the bottom or if it is yet to come.  If we have, great!  If we haven’t, great!  Don’t get me wrong I am certainly hoping that we bottomed our around $3200 as a more valuable bitcoin would do me and my family great wonders financially.  But what is very exciting to see is that adoption and infrastructure has been built up greatly around bitcoin that it has the potential to be world changing and we have the opportunity to be apart of that.
@_date: 2019-03-16 09:20:07
Not necessarily. If bitcoin can close the weekly candle today above $4000 that would be very bullish for the mid to long term.  Expect fireworks today.  Even though volume is usually lower on saturdays the bulls and bears could really slug it out.  If the bulls can manage to close above $4,000 that’s a really good sign.  If we can close a weekly at least in the mid $3900’s that’s also a bullish sign.  
For the bears to make a good case they need to close the weekly down in the 3800’s.

Yeah I’m hoping it goes to 0 so I can have it all to myself ��

Who Bernie Sanders?  Crazy enough I think he will be

Articles and posts like this is why I’m more bearish now than ever on bitcoin and all crypto.  All these fucktards at the top of the crypto space are greedy, gossiping assholes whose lives play out like a real housewives of Orange County reality show.. These eggheads could have changed the world instead they are destroying something beautiful with their personal beefs and their own lust for wealth.

So if we could successfully target more women as well as well as appeal to more religious people we could get an enormous amount of more people excited about crypto.

Neutrino hired a hacking team that sold spyware to governments known for human rights abuses.

That’s highly doubtful.  I believe Fiat will be around for many many years to come coexisting with bitcoin.  Bitcoin is obviously the better currency but it won’t sideline fiat.
@_date: 2019-02-21 19:54:45
It would be better if they paid at least a little of their taxes in bitcoin.  Demonstrating its use as a good currency will be very helpful for adoption.
@_date: 2019-02-27 00:25:28
In theory isn’t it true that the more the price tests resistance levels the more it weakens them?  
@_date: 2018-11-30 11:04:07
I have my automatic buy in targets between 3550 and 3600
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:43:38
Well I believe we will capitulate one last time and head toward the $2500-$3000 level and after that I strongly believe an accumulation period will start followed by long term bullish price action.
@_date: 2019-01-10 12:14:24
I don’t know but I had my stop loss set at 3900 on GDAX and it didn’t trigger so wtf?!  
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:57:35
I’ve been able to use buy stops and sell stops to increase my bitcoin holdings without spending anymore money.  I’m in it for the long haul as well and if there is a heinous bear market going on and I’ve already invested it’s best to just keep doing what you can do to increase your holdings as much as possible during this time.
