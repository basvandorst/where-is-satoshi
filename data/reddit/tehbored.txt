Lol, as if bitcoin is ever going to be fixed. There are too many people who benefit from it being broken. Sometime in the next year, they're going to cash out as best they can, causing the value to crash and fucking everybody who's holding.

Lol, as if this is any less true of BTC. The Winkelvosses are going to screw all of you.

Only if you need drugs, as has always been the case.

Why is this cause for celebration? If Bitcoin remained at the exact same price for a month, *that* would be a cause to celebrate.

No, not exactly. The problem causing slow transactions is a technical one. There are a number of solutions out there that would improve performance, but because bitcoin is decentralized, the various miners in the network all have to agree to adopt it. However, bitcoin is dominated by a handful of Chinese firms with a lot of money and resources, and they refuse to adopt the new standard because they are able to exploit the slowness of the network to sell priority access for a higher price. So it's not that they're sabotaging the blockchain, they're just refusing to fix it.

I can't believe anyone still thinks Bitcoin is some sort of democratic or free currency not under control of a central organization when a handful of Chinese miners have ground the system to a halt for personal profit.

It's almost like a decentralized currency doesn't work. Just like every other libertarian idea.

Yes, it's a bubble. This subreddit is a cult. Bitcoin is very clearly doomed due its slow transaction speeds, high fees, and extreme price volatility. It's obvious to anyone who hasn't drunk the koolaid that another crypto-currency like Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, or, most likely, Ethereum are going to beat it out. Downvotes to the left.

Banks are just going to make their own blockchain-based crypto-currency. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:35:04
Isn't BTC super slow right now though? It seems unsustainable. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 04:45:26
You're right I haven't. That's good to hear though.

No, that's irrelevant. The servers are what matter here. Part of the criminal operation took place on US soil, that's why they can justify extradition.

Bitcoin would still be worthless if not for drugs. Nobody wants a currency that isn't good for anything. It was only once people could spend it on drugs that it started catching on. And if the drug trade moves on to something else, then bitcoin will be forgotten. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:56:31
Why on earth would a utility company ever do that? They have no incentive to take bitcoin. It's just a headache for them that would cost more money than it ever brought in. At least 95% of the people who would like to pay with bitcoin would be content paying with cash.

Income for lawyers follows a bimodal distribution. There's a shortage of really good ones and an oversupply of mediocre ones. If you think you can graduate near the top of your class from a top 40 law school, then by all means, do it. Otherwise, you're probably better off in another profession. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:00:47
Yeah, but someone had to want it before anybody else did. You only want it because it's actually good for something. Currency is nothing more than a representation of trust. You have to trust that it will be worth something and that it will be liquid. If it's not liquid, it's no good as currency. The first major industry that accepted it was the illegal drug trade, that gave Bitcoin liquidity.

OP you should probably just find a respectable Indian law firm to do this.

Why are you buying on the darknet if you have a prescription? You can just buy from a Canadian online pharmacy. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:43:02
No, because most companies can do it to gain a competitive edge. Utilities are usually local monopolies, they have no need for an edge.

When you save dollars (with a bank, not in your mattress) that money is still in the economy. The bank invests it and it fuels growth. Bitcoins are like keeping money in your mattress but more lucrative. Bitcoins are supposed to be a currency. That is, they aren't inherently worth anything, they're just something others will accept in exchange for goods or services. In reality, they act more like a commodity, which inhibits their function as a currency. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:36:58
A digital, encrypted currency based on math is a great idea. The major downside of bitcoins is their deflationary nature. The point of currency is to be spent. With bitcoins, people have too big an incentive to save instead of spending them. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:21:50
Which is great, but only for now. The fact that bitcoins are deflationary certainly does help them get started, but 5 years from now, it will probably be a serious problem. 
If the value of bitcoins was based on how often they are spent, or some other metric of the bitcoin economy, they could be deflationary when it's good to deflate, and inflationary when it's good to inflate. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:49:58
This is a terrible idea. Bitcoins are pretty unstable. I'd say if you want to invest a little, go ahead. But 10% is too much for something so risky. I would maybe do 2-4%.

I just made an account with them. Are there any hoops I have to jump through? I remember MtGox made me provide some documents and took a few days to confirm my account.

Could the US government pass a law prohibiting merchants from accepting bitcoins as payment in order to cause the price to tank? 
@_date: 2013-11-02 18:49:24
This is a terrible idea and you should feel deeply ashamed for even thinking of it. What is the point of money that becomes worthless as soon as someone else sees it?

Eh, precious metals are overrated. I guess platinum is ok, but stay away from gold.

Sellers accounts aren't free. They're pretty expensive. I doubt anyone would want to throw away their investment by selling tainted product.

This looks very sketchy, and I'm pretty sure Paypal won't insure me since they aren't particularly fond of bitcoins. I think I'll just use bitstamp.
