Awesome, thanks Justin!

I had not - I was going to, but then Justin from Coinbase responded to this thread. But I thought I'd ping here, first, see what other peoples experiences were.

As an epilogue, I got this email from Simple, today:
Looks like you've received some trial deposits this morning from COINBASE.COM/BTC. Sign in to Simple to see the amounts, then sign in to your COINBASE.COM/BTC account to confirm them.
Once you've done that, the accounts will be linked. Woo!
–The Team at Simple
So, everything is linked up.

Same here - I've been using them for years, and I've yet to have any problems with them at all.

Haha - I'm sure he'll appreciate it, and as the sign says, the proceeds really do go to a good cause. Thanks for your generosity!

Our jr admin put this up a day or so ago, which is great, for me, as I rarely have cash on me.

Thanks John, appreciate it.

Again, very impressed at the speedy response. Thanks!

Thanks for the heads up, Dan - I actually didn't know that. What a weird rule.
But I transferred the funds from the gambling site to my own wallet, anyways, before sending it to Coinbase.
It's all a non-issue, anyways, as the Ledger Wallet people showed me. My money was never lost.

Heh...yeah, I wanted to say "on this new place, called the internet", but I didn't want to be rude.
For the record, the site I used was the 2nd one you mentioned.
@_date: 2015-10-04 15:39:13
I'll let you know after this issue is dealt with.

Yeah, Bader's jab really impressed me - he's come a long way. I thought he'd win because Evans would have ring rust, but I didn't want to risk a pretty safe parlay (Benavidez, Pena, Namajunas) on ring rust. I was pretty sure DC was going to win, and I'm kicking myself, today, for not putting both DC and Bader in that parlay.
But I'd rather be kicking myself the next day with money, than to have pushed one too many fights into a parlay. :-) Sorry about your .5 - hope you win it back quick!

This really had nothing to do with gambling, mpow, I mentioned it as just a peripheral part of the post, and never mentioned the gambling site. The problem didn't occur until the bitcoin was back under my control.
@_date: 2015-10-05 02:27:37
Yeah, just dump your purse out. That's fine.

Well, that was solved quickly:
If you look at this address on the blockchain you can see there was only one transaction:
So only 1 BTC has been sent.
The issue is that some people are "attacking" the Bitcoin network by exploiting transaction malleability.
This is an annoyance, but doesn't generate any loss of funds.
More information here:
What you need to do to fix the issue for this transaction:
1. uninstall the Ledger Chrome app
2. install it again and insert your Nano
We are working on a fix from our side, but it will take a few days.
Best regards,

That was a fast response from the company CEO, under 5 minutes, on a Sunday. Impressive.
Did what he suggested, and my missing bitcoin is back where it belongs.
