They'll make an announcement once they have everyone's coins.

Maybe they lost the key to their cold storage and don't know what to do.

Bull trap fo' shizzle.

So, is this an attempt to keep the market bullish?
@_date: 2014-02-14 06:50:20
Repeat of last night. Lame.
@_date: 2014-02-21 05:37:56
Bull trap yo.

Once it comes back online, orders will go through right away. When this happened last night all the other exchanges had a bull trap while btc-e was down. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:43:29
Good call. I bet the real story is they lost all the BTC on those shady gambling sites.
@_date: 2014-02-13 09:20:41
Ha. Nice one.

There is a long standing debate whether Tokyo is 2 or 3 syllables.

So, Cloudflare can't handle this?
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:02:46
I'm still convinced they drunkenly lost the private keys to their cold storage and are desperately trying to figure it out.
@_date: 2014-02-13 09:16:23
And now it's a massive bull run on the other sites. Everyone who was panic selling on btc-e are gonna' get screwed really hard.
@_date: 2014-02-21 05:42:17
A small percentage might also be rims.

Ouch. I don't think there's anything you can do. That's like her spending it in cash at a real casino and you going there asking for your cash back.

Congrats. I just need to figure out how to earn 150 BTC and I can pay mine off.
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:18:36
That's basically how my conversation with my parents was at dinner tonight.

Weedcoin. Earn while you burn.

Some do it to promote the use of bitcoin. Others use advertisements to offset the cost of giving it away. Some profit through the ads paying more than they are giving away.

Thanks. You rock! I'm going to try out Multibit. Hopefully I can get some friends interested. I'll take that dollar you sent me and do the same for them once I get the hang of it.
