We're operating under the IETF's definition of [Rough Consensus]( which is certainly much higher than 75%.

The settlement/payment distinction is a critical one, and cannot be escaped even by Bitcoin, unless *every single Bitcoin-backed value transfer* happens on-chain, which will never be possible or desirable.

20 tps.

Trust me, knows how all of this works.

It was only people like Roger Ver who naively made that promise, based on a misunderstanding of the technology.

I agree! I've held bitcoin for three years and never once spent it on coffee... why would I do that when I can tap-to-pay with my credit card, or use the starbucks app? 
On the other hand, I have sent btc to a vendor in australia with a 5 cent transaction fee. That is amazing.

It's a technical issue, is it not? How bizarre to try to discount that! The engineers are screaming that launching the space shuttle in cold weather will cause the booster o-rings to leak. Do you ignore that or listen to them?

I always thought that it made sense. Erik created a simple mechanism for altcoin value to drain into Bitcoin, keeping them worthless, and at the same time he can make money off of the process.

The problem with all of your comments is that you assume bad faith on the part of the people you are attacking. It is really irritating. Your comments are not very useful.
@_date: 2016-01-14 06:46:35
That's absolutely ludicrous, and akin to "if you're not with us, you're against us".

Well... he could manipulate the votes perhaps.

Wait - you think the solution to scaling is to give a few rich people in China control of the block size? And to let them perform a hostile takeover with a chain-splitting hardfork?
Who is toxic again?
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:53:50
A lot of blah blah blah.

I love it! That's why Jihan is so pissed off. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:52:49
No - where did you get that idea from?

How could it be an altcoin if most people are running Core?
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:52:18
Mining is centralized.

It could be Automod or some kind of Reddit ant-spam algorithm. I've noticed my own comments not showing up for hours - perfectly innocent ones. 
I doubt it's due to personal intervention by the mods.

Lol. Toomim's brother is an admitted pot/acid head, which is kinda hilarious. Makes you wonder if jtoomim is cut from the same cloth. So are you gonna go with: the folks who've helped us get bitcoin to a $5B+ market cap, or Cheech and Chong?

It really shows the ideological divide between those who view Bitcoin as an open technology platform for censorship resistant money, and those who see it as a product to be shaped by the whims of "customers."
@_date: 2016-02-15 03:10:53
Are you aware that Blockstream doesn't control Core development? That only one of five people with commit rights works for Blockstream (Pieter Wuille)?
@_date: 2015-09-08 02:29:38
He uses them learnin' words!
@_date: 2016-10-24 01:31:24


Are you high? This is totally false. It's like you picked a random falsehood out of the ether and decided to staunchly defend it.

Olivier Janssens, the crybaby who got himself elected to a Bitcoin advocacy group only to try to destroy it. He's an immature brat.

Such bullshit. The reason has nothing to do with that - this breakout has been anticipated for days. You nutcases tie every uptick in the price to your wet dreams.
@_date: 2016-10-24 01:33:47
What? Bitcoin's best and most promising use case is digital gold. *Redditor for 20 days*, indeed.
@_date: 2016-05-19 02:30:15
Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Ripple also got a lot of media attention. Some Bitcoincoiners freaked out over that too. In the end, you just have to realize that you can't hype your way to a network effect and brand awareness overnight. That takes years and Bitcoin has put in the time.

Which topics have you noticed that are being censored? I only notice off-topic stuff getting removed.

RBF transactions have the potential to be easy to detect (assuming wallet improvements), in which case a merchant could demand a non-RBF transaction.
