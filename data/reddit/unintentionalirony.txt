Computers are hardware, not software. Do you think scaling facebook was just a matter of scaling hardware? Facebook had no clear path for the software required to scale to billion+ people/day. For example, extensive use of machine learning to fight spam particular to social networks, if they didn't get the spam under control they would have never scaled, the place would have been a toilet bowl.
Have you ever developed a none trivial program?

Hardware is equally as important, if you hold in mind what the hardware can do &amp; what the software can do, then apply systems thinking. You can't see emergent properties by deconstruction down to the parts.
Also, Metcalfe's Law states that a value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its nodes. As this 1st iteration is just a dev kit, I would imagine 21's next step would be to integrate this hardware/software into smart phones. For the general population, smart phones are now the primary computing device.
If so, bitcoin will be a billion+ node network.

The two boards you see with the 21 computer, would have to be merged into one. New chipset &amp; whole lot of work.

I would guess smart phone integration would be client like, not full node.

Did facebook in 2005 have a clear path for their then shitty php site to scale to billion+ users login each day in 2015?

If you have developed software, surely you would be familiar with the fact that for facebook to scale they had to develop a PHP transpiler too translate PHP into C++ (also supporting tech like VM, JIT, etc). 
Obviously, the software/hardware as known in 2005 could not handle the future scenario. In 2005, no one had scaled a scripting language like PHP to anywhere close to billion UV/day. Yet, they moved forward without it been clear what the limits of scaling PHP where.

More than news, this a master class in cultivating network effect.
