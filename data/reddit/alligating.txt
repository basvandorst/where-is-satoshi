I read the slashdot article, then read the paper, then installed the software and did some mining. I let the miner on my machine for about a year. I totally forgot about it when I did a reinstall. I have no idea how many coins I had in my wallet. Maybe 0, maybe a lot.

What about people who are just using it what it's designed for, as a currency to exchange for goods and services? Are they doing it for the wrong reasons?

Quite a few studies have shown that this is a poor strategy, at least when it comes to the stock market.
DCA'ing is great if you don't have a lot of money to spend at once, averaging in is a better strategy than saving up for months before getting into the market.
But if you already have the money, DCA'ing is usually a bad idea.
There are some numbers from one study at  but keep in mind that it's from a broker. If you're really interested you can find more academic studies.

Why did they bother blurring out part of the private key? It would take seconds to brute force the missing part.

It is taught, people just don't pay attention. Do you think middle school or highschool kids care about how the federal reserve works? Kids who don't have jobs or pay bills aren't as interested as the monetary system as you might think.

You're using too many words to try to sound smart but it makes the letter really awkward to read. It's also written in the [passive voice]( which takes away some of the "punch" and just adds more words.


How about: I am writing to inquire about Chase Bank's policy on Bitcoin and Bitcoin related purchases.


I frequently recommend Chase to friends and colleagues. Your customer service is always exemplary.


Replace 'acquainted with' with 'aware of'.


Ditch 'my question is' and just say 'Does Chase Bank have an official policy on Bitcoin?' Will Chase terminate my account because of Bitcoin purchases? As a satisfied and loyal customer of Chase, I don't want to be forced to take my business elsewhere.
