hey, you are seeing the truth. you may not think you have any weight, but the way i see it, you are one more person who believes! 200 bits
@_date: 2016-01-15 08:32:05
Agreed. I think roughly $400 is resistance
@_date: 2016-01-15 08:21:13
Roughly how many coins did he have?

 If you're just getting into bitcoin, I would definitely recommend airbitz.  It's very simplistic, and I have recommended it to other people, with great results. It's also cross platform, iOS, and android. So if you ever switch, you can still get it.

Well, i guess this is where i have to be a good sport and say congrats. Right? Well here goes... Congrats

You don't have to worry about writing down a 15 word seed, it has a great user interface, &amp; I recommend it to anybody new to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-09 18:23:56
I would recommend coinbase to buy the bitcoins and AirBitz to store them.

 Why not just put it up on a service provider like vultr.com? They have better bandwidth than you, most likely, and, you can pay with bitcoin.

 This absolutely outrageous me to see, people DDOSing bitcoin nodes because they support BIP101.  In my opinion, what we should do, is collect their IP addresses, and DDOS them.  If they are running a bitcoin core full mode.

I agree with free coins are awsome

What percentage of nodes do you think is sustainable for UASF to run properly? 50+%
@_date: 2017-05-12 01:13:13
I personally really like my airbitz wallet. It's super simple and secure enough. In my opinion at least
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:53:57
Thx will most definitely do

Sounds like fun, wish I could go and have lunch with you guys. But that's way too far away. I don't think Metro Transit would get me there.

What is UASF? How does it compare to unlimited/segwit before UASF?
