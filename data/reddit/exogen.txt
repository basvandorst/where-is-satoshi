Price levels. They go down when they are deflating and up when they are inflating. As in the linked article, what costs 1 BTC today may cost 0.2 BTC tomorrow – the intrinsic value of the good hasn't changed, but the price levels have, because the purchasing power of BTC has gone up. BTC is deflating *despite* the supply going up, because supply is not the only factor.

Encyclopedias and dictionaries don't agree with you. Inflation and deflation come down to price levels/purchasing power. The money supply can affect that, but it's not the only factor. Bitcoin is by definition undergoing deflation.

The prices are determined in the currency in question, not some currency-independent unit. In your example, USD would be inflating if general price levels in USD are going up, and EUR would be deflating if general price levels in EUR are going down. It's perfectly reasonable for different currencies to simultaneously have different trends in their purchasing power.
