I remember the 1k memes. It went from 19k, then 18k, then 17k, all the way down to 6.3k! 
Glad it's on its way back, even if I just say that to make myself feel better.

Lol your definition of FUD must be very liberal. I think you're just sensitive.

Ya i think people have their own reasons....

Sometimes ya. When its acting like a big il bitch.

At this point, REALIST seems more appropriate....

Just because someone correctly predicted a price trend doesn't mean it's fud. I think youre blinded by your MOON gains and 10000000x comments.  You don't even know what we are talking about anymore.

Eat your words buddy. We touched below 8k today. Someone saying it might go to 7k isnt automatically a fudster. You talk of volatility but cant read a chart? 
Wake up. You just dont like reading the damn truth. Maybe you need tongetna hold of your blood pressure and stop looking atbyourndelta so much

This. The USD value of 1 BTC does change but not the quantity, but his USD in his bank account stays the same.
