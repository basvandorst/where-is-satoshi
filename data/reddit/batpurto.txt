"I'm not sure what to make of it because there was a lot more than $50K in there at the time"

The affidavit was Shaun Bridges (one of the corrupt special agents from the Silk Road case)
Here's the warrant: [
Press at the time reported that $50,000 had been seized from Marks personal account. 
*However*, looking again at the warrant, there was in fact permission to seize **up to** $50,000. 
The hand-written inventory states that the actual amount seized was $8,200.87
The cause stated for freezing Mark's personal account was that
"Bank records also show a transfer of $50,000 in January 2012 from the 7657841313 [Mt Gox's Mutum Sigillum LLC] account to a personal account in the name of Mark Karpeles with account number 6836757515"
This was Mark's personal account at Wells Fargo

To be clear, when you're referring to the account that should have had more than $50,000, You're referring to the one we've dubbed 'Mark's personal account' (6836757515)?
edit: grammer ;) 
changed Marks to Mark's

You're very welcome.
I can't see anything in the warrant that says which state or branch (within the US) the bank was located.
From the warrant, it seems that the main flow of funds went:
Sumitomo Mitsui Bank in Japan &gt;&gt; Wells Fargo (Mutum Sigillum) in the US  &gt;&gt; Dwolla payment service
The transfer of $50,000 between the corporate and personal Wells Fargo account occurred in January 2012, while you were still at Mt. Gox. The same Month that you were offered the CEO role! Can you think of any reasons why Mark would have transferred $50,000 into his personal account? I also wonder why would he have a personal account in the US anyway?

Apparently Mark had his own separate bank account, which had $50,000 seized from it, around the same period that the MtGox Wells-Fargo &amp; Dwolla accounts were seized.

Hi, did you get any clarity on whether this was co-mingling or not?
