I have been doing some research on Adam Back, Austin Hill and Zero-Knowledge.  I have a friend who worked for them in Montreal in 99-2001 timeframe before the dot.com crash caused the company to change directions.
Here are some interesting links I've been able to put together,
1. Searching  twitter feed I found an article he wrote recently about Anonymity &amp; Pseudonymity where he lambasts some of the dumb Secret/Whisper apps for awful security, 
2. In that article he links to a media post about ZeroKnowledge that I guess was a magazine cover.  Fascinating story I wasn't even aware of all the details,
3. This is detailed history of the company, it's founders and it's work in eCASH that was written by some guy named David Philips that goes through their fundraising history and work in privacy / eCash.   These guys were the real deal. Hardcore cypherpunks &amp; serious tech innovators.  Looks like they invented TOR before there was TOR.
4. I found this whitepaper on eCash &amp; Private Credentials that I guess Dr. Stefan Brands (who I found out was David Chaum's PhD student &amp; Ron Rivests) invented and was owned by Austin Hill's company who tried to commercialize it.
So if they had all these cypherpunks and Adam Back was there, how can they not be/or at least know who Satoshi is.   I suspect strongly that despite his previous claims not to be, Adam Back is Satoshi or they are some how involved.   How else could they invent side chains and get the immediate involvement of so many core developers ?
