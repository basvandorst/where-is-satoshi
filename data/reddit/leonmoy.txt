I think this is a worthwhile distinction to be made (and one that I haven't personally heard before), but just so I understand - What means do Chinese citizens have to obtain Bitcoin if not through the Chinese banking system?  Are foreign banks common in China?  i.e. Does this severely limit a Chinese person's ability to get Bitcoin, or does it just make it a little bit more of a hassle/limit large transactions?
FYI: I'm an American using Coinbase, so getting Bitcoin through non-traditional banking is foreign to me.

Paraphrased from Wikipedia: A Ponzi scheme involves an operator who pays returns to investors with new capital from new investors.
Simply put:  Bitcoin has no operator.  The claim that it is a Ponzi scheme is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of Bitcoin or Ponzi schemes, or both.  Furthermore, the current value of Bitcoin is largely based on speculation about its UTILITY as a financial instrument.  Whereas a Ponzi scheme is nothing more than a shell game, the price fluctuations of Bitcoin occur as the market collectively processes huge amounts of information to seek the true value of this new technology.
IMO, people who call Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme clearly don't understand Bitcoin and are simply slandering it by associating it with a financial scam - which they probably don't understand either.

According to Wikipedia, either pronunciation is acceptable.  i.e.  "ah" as in "palm," or "ae" as in "face."  I'm American and I pronounce it krah-ken.  Considering the age of the myth, the pronunciation is probably European in origin.

If you think BTC has intrinsic value then, barring catastrophic failure, it would follow that it will most likely go up again -- possibly significantly so.  The long term trend is clear.  Rather than trying to "figure out" what BTC is going to do in the immediate future, decide how much you can safely invest and then continue buying at a steady rate, and be patient. Remember that BTC is still an experimental technology that could fail or be replaced, so don't put any money into it that you can't afford to lose.

If buys the bitcoin today he's guaranteed to lose no more than ~$450.
