Has anyone managed to buy a video card with this promo code? I haven't been able to get anything due to other deals blocking it.

There's the problem that cryptocurrency will lose a lot of credibility if we've been hyping bitcoin to everyone all this time, and then we suddenly turn around and say 'ok we're switching to litecoins now, you might not have heard of it but trust me it's better'.

Perhaps the program should warn users if they're storing above a certain 'pocket change' amount?

It depends. NZ is much cheaper for health care and education, but overseas goods cost a lot more. Like anywhere housing depends on location.

You might want to put in the measurements or something to give a sense of scale

Cost of living is pretty damn high here, although I'm in Central Auckland so YMMV.

The NZ market is pretty small, so I'll probably have to check it at the time. It probably isn't worth it since I would have to find a bitcoin ATM over there, and would have to pay the fee for that. I was more wondering if anyone had done it before.

This is the bitcoin subreddit, not the libertarian subreddit. We're not all libertarians, some of us live in countries with competent governments.

I disagree with the assertion that it has to be all or nothing. Bitcoin could become the currency of the internet with little use in the real world, as it has more usefulness in the former than the latter.

Does Overstock offer any discount for using Bitcoin?

SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab S 10.5
Plus some cable ties to get it up to $500. I'm in NZ so I got it sent to my aunts house in CA, will pick it up when I go there in a month and a half :)

'Real world' being, in this context, face-to-face transactions.

Keep getting cockblocked by gift items attached to what I want to buy (Radeon R9 290X) &gt;:(

You know, I don't know how I'd feel about him winning the presidency, but I want him to win the nomination, because at least there might be some interesting debates this time.

Oh yeah, of course *slaps forehead*

If I'm not mistaken banks deposits in Cyprus are only insured up to 100,000; tough shit if you put in more than that IMO.

I think some kind of cloud backup is wise. I have an encrypted wallet sitting behind two step authentication on a couple of cloud services.

I can access them via any computer I have marked as trusted (ie. my home computer) without needing my phone, and if all else fails I have a copy on a memory stick.

I would hope not!

The article says it can't be used to give the time with precision, couldn't you just add a timestamp to the text of the document before hashing it?
