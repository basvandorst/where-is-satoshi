Thanks, v handy explanation. I did only invest a small amount, thinking of upping my amounts in the short term before I start in the longer term. Thoughts? Is the consensus still that it's a good time to buy?

I'd LOVE a white heartbeat (Edit - minimalist white-grey) t shirt in medium size!

Aye, I'd be interested too.

I understand, but why such a drastic undervaluing if that's the case? Surely something clicked and the masses have realised it's undervalued? What is that 'something'?

How'd you figure the true value is $1m?
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:30:59
I...can't argue with that!

Does the finite nature and guaranteed depreciation not limit its ability to become a viable currency in the long term?

Heh, I haven't even heard a reasonable explanation for $1m! Good time to buy do you think? Seems like a calm before a storm right now but don't know if it's an up storm or down storm...

Sorry - very new to the sub and as you can expect, it's quite overwhelming taking everything in.

I don't know much about the other stuff, but I know we only value Bitcoin in relation to govt backed currencies because Bitcoin isn't widely accepted enough yet to buy the commodities we usually use that govt currency for.
