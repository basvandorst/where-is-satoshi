Most likely.

Estimated circulating Bitcoin ~16,717,500... therefore:
200,000,000,000 / 16,717,500 = 11,963.51

It may seem like BTC is going down a lot, but percentage-wise this isn't much compared to previous dips and minor corrections.
By the way, we are still up for the week. This is nothing more than healthy price consolidation.

What dip? Zoom out.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:55:13
Wow, what a surprise.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:08:53
It's a pool of resources.

Technically nothing, since I haven't sold any.
But I have enough to retire comfortably.

Digital Gold.

This is definitely the highest quality one.

The subtle Bitcoin logo really puts this one over the top.
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:19:17
I would consider that bet. Especially since the 50 BTC would be worth so much less if it was actually under $5,000.

Are you referring to BCH here? I thought BCH supporters claim that a bigger block size meant lower transaction fees? If so, an attacker clearly wouldn't be spamming $8/tx if that were the case.

Solid advice: put it all in doge coin and then hold that.

Once more institutional investors start jumping in, we will hit a 1T market cap pretty quick. I predict the end of 2018.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:41:32
$8,989 on GDAX.. so it won't be long for the other exchanges to hit $9,000 as well.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:11:06
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:04:18
Now that $9,000 has been breached, we will go from 9k to 10k faster than we went from 8k to 9k.
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:47:37
$6,600 and then back over $7k within a few hours.
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:00:47
Agreed. It's unfortunate because many of these scams take advantage of the new people and give a bad name to cryptocurrencies. The scams aren't going away anytime soon.

10k before the end of the year is slowly becoming a reality.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:43:43
I think there will be a sizable correction once 10k is hit... then it will bounce back and recover like every other time.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:42:19
Great charts, keep it up!
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:51:01
Yeah, it certainly feels too good to be true at times.
In my opinion this is still just the beginning of the global adoption phase, and pretty soon we will look back and think that BTC at 9k is cheap. We will undoubtedly see some sizeable corrections along the way, but we are only scratching the surface right now.

If you're uncertain, I would just invest half before the fork and then the remaining half after the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:05:38
Some people expected a huge dip after the Bitcoin cash fork, however Bitcoin was extremely resilient and the price wasn't affected very much.
Nobody knows exactly what will happen after the 2x fork (if it even happens on November 16th).
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:36:10
December 4, 2017

You're right, it would likely still need to be associated with fiat (usd, euro, etc..)
To a certain degree, [Tether]( and similar services will help with the digital-to-fiat exchanges.

Everyone knows that the video is old when they see the prices.
The same logic applies. Some people are panicking, but they need to realize that Bitcoin will continue to "crash" and then go back up again and again...
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:37:55
My prediction: very little change.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:21:25
The fork is expected to occur on November 16th.
The fork is just a branch off of the Bitcoin code repository along with some changes. When the fork happens, the number of forked coins you have will be equivalent to the amount of Bitcoin you were holding when the fork took place.

So... this you why you HODL for the long term.
