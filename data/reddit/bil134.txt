The best is to implement a randomizer for clean and unclean coins.
i.e: 
If the coin is marked, there's a 0.6234 probability that it will be unmarked
If the coin is unmarked, there's a 0.5429 probability that it will be marked.

You have a point.
I'll avoid making further comments until I read about it.

I lied. 
This is an alt account. 
What I posted was a clever idea that I had for a second. I never intended for anyone to donate money to me.
It was under deceit that you tipped me. I'll give you back the money as soon as I can, I just wasn't raised to act like this.

If you don't have kids, go ahead. You are making a very very very VERY VERY risky choice.
If you have a family, please stop gambling their futures away.
That my two satoshis of advice.

Except that guns, unlike bitcoin, are only used to kill people. Or kill animals. Or basically, kill. Or harm physically, I guess.

I'm here to observe, to see where this goes.
I care not about making money, or having bitcoin.
I just want to see how this will end, without being part of the action, without belonging to your community. That's all.

I am unsure if I understand what you are trying to say. If I were to accept your first sentence, I would be tempted to say that governments *also* use guns for defensive purposes more than for killing people.
But I think I am missing something here, so I'd love it if you could clarify this for me.

I am from South America myself and I know that the situation in Venezuela is getting pretty damn weird.
Buy as many bitcoins as possible, travel to Colombia or Peru or Brazil if possible and transfer money there. Things will get crazy soon, probably
