That is how decimals work, you can go infinitely small and infinitely large in numbers. In the case of bitcoin the large caps at 21 million. However can you not trade in increasingly small amounts?
Please forgive my ignorance, I didn't know that there was a smaller unit then a bitcoin and that satoshis are a thing, or are you making that up as an example?

I never saw anything in my initial research that bitcoins are limited to  8 decimal places. Hence why I'm asking. And yeah you are right but there is notation for 1/3 in decimal form. But thats a semantic that isn't relevant to this discussion.

I never saw anywhere or heard anyone mention that bitcoins are only divisible to 1/100 million. Hence my confusion and why I asked the question. If that is indeed the case then my question is answered. For what it's worth mass is finite and 1kg can't be converted to 10kg without additional energy or more mass.

By creating more and more bitcoins by dividing it up more and more (assuming that it can't be divided past the hard limit of 1/100 million) then you would give rise to inflation, and bitcoin as a currency would fail. However since I have now learned that bitcoins have a limited supply and can't be divided past 1/100 million my point is moot and my question answered.

Okay, I follow that line of logic. But what about the development of new technology that can push the possible numbers that it can store. I've seen people talking about satoshi's in this thread I'm not sure if those are real and whether or not bitcoins can only be divisible to 1/100 million. If that's the case then yes bitcoins are finite and my questions are answered. Otherwise I'm still very confused.

In the case of bread we are dealing with a material object that has a physical limit on the number of atoms that make it up, so no in the case of bread you would reach a limit. However in the case of Bitcoin its a digital currency and as far as I understand there is no minimum number. 0.00000001 and 0.0000000000000001 bitcoins are both possible as is 0.0000000000000000003837847.

Decimal notation and fractions represent the same thing. Any fraction can be converted to a decimal and vice verse. In some cases its simply easier to talk about fractions then saying the decimal.

Right if we were dealing with physical currency, that is not the case with a digital platform. I see people talking about things being worth 0.00000001 or some other arbitrary number all the time when it comes to bitcoins. Or is there a lower limit that I'm not aware of. 
I'm asking because I don't know and have only very loosely been aware of bitcoins since their inception.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:46:55
Right which I understand, but there is literally an infinite number of fractions that can be traded between 0 and 1 alone, let alone 21 million. That's what I'm not understanding.

Here's a link from Wolfphram Alpha describing infinite decimal notation. [link](

I didn't know that, that's why I asked.

Essentially yes combining that with effects of inflation from economics. You basically get a system that while the cap is 21,000,000 there would still be be an infinite number of bitcoins to be traded essentially diluting the currency and not making it a truly non-fiat currency.  Similar to how any company could print as much money as it needed causing hyper-inflation and crashing its market. 
However now that I've learned that bitcoins are actually limited and not divisible past a certain point something that didn't come up in my initial reading. I am starting to understand the potential of bitcoins as a currency.

That and some other posts helped a great deal thank you. I was a little misguided about it being divided an infinite amount and the relationship it would have with inflation. 
In my mind I was comparing the infinite division of a Bitcoin with the printing of additional money. I've since learned that bitcoins have a minimum value. That alone showed me the error in my logic.

As for the hard drive that's because the smallest byte is acutally a bit you can't get smaller then a bit like a cent. However with bitcoins as far as I've seen (and I could totally be wrong) people list decimal values arbitrarily. So I was lead to believe that there are an infinite number of bit coins even if it does cap at 21 million.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:59:26
Technically there is an infinite number of numbers between 0.00001 and 0.00002. Unless of course that is a lower hard limit. I've never seen it ever referenced in my initial research, everything just always talked about there being 21 million total bitcoins no thing ever mentioned a satoshi or what the smallest increment of a bitcoin is. As in a cent being the smallest of a dollar.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:03:27
Not a troll, I honestly don't know and that's why I'm asking. I've never seen someone mention a satoshi or that bitcoins can only be divisible to 1/100 million. That's why I was asking.
BTW Happy Cake Day.
