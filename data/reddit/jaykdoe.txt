If I were in your shoes I would have no problem betting that 15K on still turning a hefty profit if you can HODL for 5-10 years. I think people get too caught up in the short term gains we've seen in the past with BTC, and people make investments without considering it a long term investment. I honestly don't care how high the price goes at this point in the short term, I am not going to be selling out in the next 2 or 3 years regardless. Maybe I am too bullish on BTC, but I have no problem just sitting and waiting to see how this plays out in the long run.

Would it make you feel better if I told you I'm still up 4,800%?

I'm here for you man. But all jokes aside, I've been investing in BTC since 2013, and with all the climbs and dips, I have only panicked once and in that moment I lost 2 BTC. After that I told myself I'd never panic sell again, and have committed to never selling out until BTC reaches a specific price I've set. I have absolutely no doubt that BTC will not only get back to the price in which you bought in, but I'm pretty confidence that it will far exceed that price. I'm in this game for the long haul, and if you have patience I truly believe you will be rewarded quite well for your investment. Try not to read the news and follow the price of BTC too much, the more you think about it the harder it is to remain patient.

Yes, I have the pins and can access both of them currently. It's just that if something ever goes wrong, I don't have the keys to restore them, although I'm quite positive I'll find them either when I least expect it, or directly after I decide to move all my coins and reset everything for security reasons. I have two hardware wallets, so I can simply move everything over to one, reset the wallet of choice, and then move everything back over....But, considering I have the keys *somewhere*, and I'm sure I'll eventually find them, I haven't rushed to do so at this point. It's clearly the sensible decision, but considering I've already waited about 8 months to consider this option just goes to show how unreasonably relaxed I've been about it.

Great advice, thank you!

The renter was actually a friend of mine, who I would guess has never even heard of bitcoin and he never had access to the garage. It's a detached building with a separate lock on it. But ya, I probably should be transferring everything and resetting my wallets. It's certainly the correct advice.
@_date: 2019-03-05 09:44:15
I'm about 99% positive the seeds are just hidden away way too well for even me to find them at the moment. But you are correct, the smart move is probably to play it safe and move everything securely. Luckily, I can just move everything off one wallet, reset it, and then move everything back. The other part of me is wondering if it's worth tearing apart my garage to find the damn keys...But alas, I've already spent hours looking for them, so I likely won't find them until I move again, and if not then, years later when I least expect it.
@_date: 2019-03-05 10:02:38
This is a really great point. How exactly do you account for hard forks not yet supported by your hardware wallet in a situation like this?

And I can confirm you can use bitcoin in Taiwan. I used it to pay for my hostels last May

You're definitely right, but just to be devil's advocate here for a second, how would you show me an increase in its use as a currency that matches up with the the price increase after the spikes, when the price corrects itself and stabilizes? I would say it's pretty consistent that the minimum price raises after each of these bubbles burst and continues an upward trend but without any specific increase in its use as a currency. What exactly would your prediction be in this case when it comes to the max price we'll see in this spike and the min price we'll see after it?
Lastly, the more I think about it, the more I realize that even if I can't show you a specific instance that would directly correlate with an increase in bitcoins use as a currency, there are some significant factors related to the cryptocurrency market that absolutely do have an affect on the price.  For instance:
* Libra is backed by  Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Stripe, Spotify, Uber, and Lyft. Whether you think Libra is good or bad for bitcoin, one thing that is for sure is that it's a direct sign of acceptance and mass adoption of cryptocurrencies by large corporate institutions. JPMorgan even launched its own internal cryptocurrency.
* The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has cleared bitcoin derivatives provider LedgerX to offer physically settled bitcoin futures contracts.
* The entire cryptocurrency market is more mature than it was in 2017 and this spike in price doesn't seem to be driven by fomo.

Anyone who gets excited and sells at $12k doesn't deserve to profit off bitcoin in the long run. I bought in at $20 a coin, and promised myself I was in it for the long haul. I didn't even flinch at the $20k price, and neither should you. Just sit back and relax, cause it's going to get HUGE. You just can't expect that to happen in a couple years.
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:07:11
I 100% agree. I'm only cashing out when it's time for me to retire....Hopefully before I'm 40 ;)

Oh ya, can yo also provide a link for me to back up this statement?
"In this specific case, however, a couple large investors bought a ton of bitcoin and caused the price to skyrocket "
I haven't seen anything on this anywhere as of yet. The only thing I could find on direct causes of the price increase was what's been dubbed the "Trump safety rally".
*"The price of gold and bitcoin was jumping on Tuesday morning as the US hit Iran with fresh sanctions. Gold and bitcoin — both seen as safe haven assets — have been rallying in response to the rising tensions between the two nations.* 
*“A lot of this is coming out of Iran. So people in China are buying BTC because the trade war is on and there are more talks of ramifications.*
*“And in Iran, obviously, they are worried about a major attack from America at some point and the Iranian currency is rubbish and you can’t buy gold there anymore. So, you can’t put your money in gold. But you can put it in bitcoin. So that is where the demand is coming from bitcoin.”*

I did not. My assumption is that it would simply not ever be used for daily transactions and more as a storage of value, like gold, with another coin winning out as the transactional standard. Which is somewhat already the  current state of it's use, and has been for awhile.

And sometimes that never happens. I initially bought in at $20. When I decided to buy more, it was at $100, and I said to myself, "Hell, I'll just wait for it to drop back down to $20 or maybe even $50." But, guess what? That never happened, and I regret not buying more at $100 when I had the chance. It's certainly possible to do, but it's more risky than simply HODLING and waiting for it to stabilize at price you're happy cashing out at. In theory, your basic investment strategy is perfect, but in practice, it's actually minimized profits for a lot of people.
@_date: 2019-06-28 05:45:58
In my opinion, "managing your risk" for most people means holding. With that being said, I do sell when I think the current price in over inflated and buy back in when it goes down, and I have made some profits doing so, but that practice in and of itself is risky, unless you have extensive trading experience and knowledge of the markets. I think telling the average person there's no reason not to sell if you think the current price is over inflated is bad advice, simply because it implies most people are smart enough to make responsible and intelligent decisions regarding things they know nothing about. Personally, I think the best decision for the majority of people is to simply buy bitcoin and hold it for the long term if they want to profit, and most of the people that lose money in bitcoin do so by attempting to make profits trading. I am quite confident that all the people that lost money in 2017/18 with bitcoin would have actually made a profit if they simply would have bought it and held on to it for the next 5-10 years. I am no expert, but I certainly feel confident that $20k is far from the highest price we're going to see in the future.

Mine was a hostel in Taiwan in 2016 after my girlfriend who had recently moved there broke up with me and kicked me out of her place on my 1st week of a 5 week visit. Needless to say, it didn't work out. But it was really cool to be able to use bitcoin in a moment where I didn't have a ton of cash to spare and desperately needed it to pay for 4 weeks of unexpected expenses that were essential for survival in a foreign country.

This is the only way you might possibly get your funds back, and even then, this story is lacking too many details to know how this may turn out. Binance isn't going to do anything, unless they are legally obligated to do so. File the police report and start there.

This is a really cool idea! I'd like to learn more about your goals, processes, and what your needs are. I've helped a number of startups gain traction and get noticed by big time investors, and if you have the expertise to do what you say, I may be interested in partnering up and helping you find funding. Send me a PM if you'd like to discuss. Either way, don't give up, I think you're on to something here!

Thanks everyone for the comments! I was able to empty both legacy wallets and send the balance to my Ledger with 1 sat/byte using RBF settings just in case, and both transactions cleared in less than 2 hours!
@_date: 2019-05-28 22:58:10
Awesome, thanks so much for letting me know! I'm not worried about how long it takes, just don't want it to get stuck. I also just learned about RBF while researching this, so once I imported my wallet to Electrum and enabled that, apparently I can increased the fee if it ever did get stuck. Anyways, much appreciated :)
