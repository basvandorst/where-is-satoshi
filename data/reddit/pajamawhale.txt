There are still people who believe BTC will go to $30,000 this year. And, of course, the twins are saying $100,000 over the course of time.  I don't believe there is any way to really predict this market. But, I don't believe December is the be all and end all of the market.

My take:  He says, "I'm talking about ... the possibility of what could happen — not in the near term, but in a few years from now — with a consumer application in which there's trust and legitimacy with regard to a digital currency."  Trust and legitimacy -- iow, centralized authority.  He is like a lot of other very established business people who profit off of the current system. They want to kill this movement. When they emphasize blockchain over bitcoin they do that as to convince people that bitcoin should not be invested in.  Maybe Bitcoin won't survive. But I hope it does.

 Sounds to me like Warren wants to pick up some BTC at a discount.

Yeah, baby. Well I'm waiting for you to be left all alone; after all your good time lovers have kicked you to the curb.

I used to be baffled by this too.  This article has really clarified the issue for me. This is Part 3 of a 4 part series. The entire series is well worth a read:
TLDR -- the salient point to me is a commodity has to establish it's long term value as a hoarding commodity before it will ever be accepted as a currency.  (Although in the case of societies that lack a banking structure or a stable currency it seems it could be adopted sooner just because of it's present value.)

Compare "wage growth" with the growth in the CPI. Doesn't look good.

You mean "Barnes and Noble" -- but he might have been thinking of Borders, because B&amp;N is still around.

RT has been critical of Putin. Especially of his anti-gay policies. Nor do I believe that the fall of the US Govt is something Putin desires. He has no idea what would replace it anymore than the US understood what would replace Saddam Hussein. When you're talking about a country stock full of nuclear weapons, you are better off with the devil you know.  Certainly, getting rid of US dominance would be desirable; The US has become so abusive of it's power that the entire world would probably appreciate a diminution of it's dominance. A good number of informed American citizens also would appreciate that as it is the US citizens paying for the country's imperialism that really gives them no benefit in return.

Sure but Russia and China can do that without RT informing us. RT is doing us a service by informing us on a world reality that the U.S. propaganda networks won't.

Or maybe it just wasn't a very good joke?

Matecheck? Is that like... a rubber?

Yeah. I just looked into czechmate.com --- the domain is for sale.
