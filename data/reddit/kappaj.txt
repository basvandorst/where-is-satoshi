$20 fee on a 1 million dollar transaction is alot? ok then

You have a fundamental misunderstanding of how Bitcoin works. Bitcoin transactions are processed by miners, decentralized throughout the globe. If a large power failure were to occur, the difficulty would adjust to allow the same amount of transactions to be processed with fewer amounts of miners. Centralized payment platforms such as Visa or Mastercard rely on a centralized server network, meaning a power/grid failure is far more likely to disrupt these networks (as they are typically in one place and identifiable). Bitcoin is hardcoded to be a decentralized network.
Bitcoin also uses ECDSA (Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm) for private/public key generation which is far more secure than a credit card or debit card number for example.

Dang that's cool, I kinda wish it had the Times article from the genesis block "Chancellor on the brink of second bailout of banks"

What even is the motive of this? Hired by Roger Verr for not having BCash support?!?

I could never afford it, but what's the hashrate on something like this?
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:08:58
Strange, you'd think with the large increase of hashrate over the past few days, block computations would increase the speed of confirmations and lower the fees. Mempool doesn't look very suspicious either. hmm....

probably not, no. Maybe during the correction the following weeks.

Love this, where can I get one?

who cares lol

The comments are a bit delayed, sent mine on 7/13 and it still hasn't been posted.

Cool! I do not speak it, but thank you for your contribution :)

I'm so used to Bitcoin and altcoins (atleast the top 10) having very similar percentage gains/losses. It struck me as being odd :p
@_date: 2018-07-11 19:08:55
lmao so true
@_date: 2018-07-19 01:16:05
No, they're just delayed. Some really stupid comments have been getting through regardless. Check the dates emails from 7/11 are still being added daily.

Interesting website, I'm curious how accurate these predictions are. Is there any information regarding how the algorithm actually works?
@_date: 2018-07-09 05:17:39
That's an awesome idea! Maybe a minigame?
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:59:46
Isn't this obvious?
@_date: 2018-12-02 05:49:22
WHAT AM I GONNA DOOOO?
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:50:07
These are absolutely awesome, and especially at a reasonable price!
