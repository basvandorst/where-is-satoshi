Nice looking site so far, thx.  
FWIW   doesn't update for me when left open. Win7, FF 43.0, uBlock Origin (only blocking google analytics). Probably something on my end but I thought I'd mention it anyway as other sites update in the same browser.

Woops, I was jumping between forums and misspoke for the rules here. I found your address tho and dropped a few in. Thanks for the work.
@_date: 2015-06-24 05:21:24
woops, you just got 0.0203 BTC more! Thx for the work.

Found this standing request from Feb 3rd on the coinbase forums.
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:08:04
This is great info, thanks. You should post your address from the site here to encourage donations.
@_date: 2015-06-02 15:27:43


PGP would be nice. For now in coinbase I just turn these notifications off.
@_date: 2015-05-01 17:44:39
That seems like an awful idea with a lot of open questions about security.   I was hoping for something more stunning from 21inc.

I use [Ally Bank]( they been active for around 4 years now I think. I transfer from my main bank account into it then to Coinbase to purchase BTC.  
No maintenance fees on a savings accounts and 0.99% interest paid on deposits monthly. Limit of 6 transfers a month though so take that into account.

Ha well that's what I was originally thinking... That their new model was coming online or being tested out. I don't watch the blocks often for who is getting what, but when I had recently this last week or so I hadn't seen them in there and it piqued my interest.
@_date: 2015-08-10 06:06:06
There is also  if you fancy that site. The mod there expressed a fairly different tact:


I'm not sure how better to put it. XT will have a BTC impact in some fashion, and I'd like to know about whats going on sans echo chamber BS.
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:13:31
Ah ok thanks. Guess I just hadn't notice them generating them recently and thought this was something new on their end. Never mind.
@_date: 2015-08-07 01:31:41
Hey thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:09:39
NP, you must buy an actual slice of pizza with BTC someday though!
@_date: 2015-08-06 23:28:31
Interesting. BTW your persistent top banner renders poorly on mobile in portrait (Nexus 9 and Firefox) and covers up the top of the page. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 23:41:26
I don't but I'm late to the party on why not? Honest question.
@_date: 2015-08-10 06:14:23
uh ohh, just got me at 11th!
@_date: 2015-08-06 23:45:34
Sure thing. I have a number of devices I can take a look at it on and PM you.
@_date: 2015-08-04 23:53:39
Never mind I see the mess earlier with it and the Satoshi bug.
@_date: 2015-08-07 15:45:18
Almost! We kinda missed the part though where I need a TX fee to get through the spam, how I need a service (with fee) to get BTC and how most merchants need a service to convert at least some to fiat to pay bills. Still so much better though!
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:56:35
looks like you have an extra .com in your .com there!
@_date: 2015-07-23 22:40:18
Ah thanks. I was surprised to not find this on coindesk and it always eluded me. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 15:09:22
Well *someday* you'll be able to enjoy that BTC slice!
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:53:10
I received the same notice as well and had a WTF moment. Thanks for posting this information.
@_date: 2015-07-10 20:10:50
First time eh, you should celebrate with a treat! 1 donut @_date: 2015-07-10 20:27:47
Ok. Links to why? I'd like to educate myself.
@_date: 2015-07-09 19:18:58
Sure sounds like that sometimes! But they are developers/engineers and not banker/financiers so their motivation and rewards drive different behavior I suppose.
@_date: 2015-07-13 21:54:59
Thanks for the reply. I was thinking of doing exactly that but wasn't sure about the bandwidth consumption on my home line (stuck with standard comcast). I may take a look at doing this at work for a bit or setting up a VPS to toy with.
@_date: 2015-08-06 03:44:14
Right on, thanks for the list. Have a pizza_slice on me @_date: 2015-07-23 21:10:32
I've always wondered when Coindesk considers the "closing price" on bitcoin? Midnight the time of the exchange in question? 
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:32:13
Are there any tools or services out there that can let me set a limit and alert when N number of of unconfirmed transactions are in the backlog, or set at alert on the size of the blockchain mempool? (or other such behind-the-scenes metrics) . I did some poking around on the various block explorers and even on ITTT but didn't see anything like this except for BTC price.  
Seems like it would be handy for when other stress tests or spam inevitably hits bitcoin again.
@_date: 2015-09-03 04:36:16
This was a reasoned response in a time of flames. Thank you.
@_date: 2015-09-07 03:40:30
Huh... I didn't realize there was hate for this site. I don't use it, but if any of these silent downvoters would care to comment, I'd be interested in the discussion.
@_date: 2015-09-04 05:22:00
Surprised? Yes. Also the thread on supporting BIP101.
