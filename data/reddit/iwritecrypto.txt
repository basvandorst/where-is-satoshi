The price of a commodity usually goes up as it becomes more scarce, but the price of Bitcoin is very heavily manipulated.
More people owning Bitcoin could drive the price upwards in theory, but that doesn't necessarily happen in practice, no.

This could be an individual cell in Syria with no direct access to foreign state funding, or a group of scammers, or a government honeypot designed to entrap donors. Who knows - pretty interesting coming across a site claiming to be crowdfunding for paramilitary muhijadeen training either way.

Well, that's very interesting! Didn't know that, going to have to read up about it.

Hi, I visited the dark web site and wrote this article as well as posting it here, and it's not FUD.
99% of terrorism is funded by fiat? The other 1% certainly didn't come from this site - as it says in the article literally no money whatsoever has been donated to the dark web marketplace site, so I don't see how it relates to FUD.
The idea of a dark web marketplace crowdfunding crypto to train terrorists is interesting and newsworthy in its own right, it has nothing to do with price movement or bitcoin=terrorism or anything else. It's equally possible that this is just a scam or a government honeypot - an interesting thing to hear about either way.
@_date: 2018-09-16 11:47:45
Please do explain your stance then.   
I work full-time in the cryptocurrency space and am a staunch supporter of Bitcoin an mass adoption of crypocurrency in general, and even I have to say that the person you're replying to is correct. The power imbalance in terms of rich vs poor is so, so much more pronounced with Bitcoin than in fiat currency, I'm sure youagree with that part at least.

I really don't agree with you there, we've literally seen massive amounts of market manipulation by people throwing huge amounts of BTC around, crashing the price, accumulating, pumping, selling, crashing, etc.
They can't make you sell, but the BTC elite can and do tank the value of your Bitcoin all the time. They can't print out more and benefit from permanently inflating the price, I guess that's what you're driving at and I agree with you there.  
At the smae time, anyone who is actually trying to use BTC as a currency in areas like Venezuela, Egypt, Iran, etc, are constantly robbed of their value by BTC whales - they have to spend it because it's their money, and they're robbed on a daily basis due to the massive wealth disparity within Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-13 17:53:04
Very possibly, honeypot or just a scam. Serious question - would it be possible to trace Monero donated through this site via a VPN and Tor?
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:45:19
Whoah man - that absolutely is true, are you serious?   
Governments have free reign over their currency's value, yes - they are also answerable to their populace and in any case it's in their interest to [keep inflation at a rate of 1 - 2% annually]( Anything more than that is generally incompetence, not fraud.  
Whales on the other hand are accountable to no-one and require far fewer funds to significantly impact the value of BItcoin for their own personal gain. They don't need to try and mess with the value of an international currency used in government sanctioned trading, they just need to manipulate the Bitcoin network which is way, way easier to do and more profitable as well.   
I'm sorry, you're wrong on this one man. I have high hopes for Bitcoin, but if you think it's somehow fairer or *less* controlled than fiat (!) you're very sorely mistaken and you need to dig a little deeper on that one.
@_date: 2018-08-13 19:51:15
Ah, neither implementation is what Satoshi envisioned. BCH is honestly closer to what they outlined in the white paper, and it doesn't really matter now because the project has evolved way beyond that. BTC is obviously dominating the market due to having the most public support, and for anyone who wants to see how bigger blocks play out there's BCH.   
I think if Satoshi wanted a say, they would have stuck around, and it's probably better for the project that they didn't.
@_date: 2018-08-21 22:07:27
Is that USD? True, but generally speaking most everyday goods won't cost hundreds or thousands of units of your currency to buy, unlike places like Venezuela, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, etc.

@_date: 2018-08-21 21:34:28
That's a fair point, although I'm sure if Bitcoin becomes more widely used people can just invent new units like kilo-toshis and say 23 KS or something like that. 
In Indian rupees they have a word (crore) for the same reason, to refer to ten million rupees because they deal in so many units. Then the word lakh is for one hundred thousand rupees, etc.
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:48:18
Why, do you know for a fact who Satoshi is? I have my assumptions like everyone, but unless you know it could be a man, woman, or group of people, and 'they' is the word to use for an unknown person or group.
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:45:27
OK. In literally every possible scenario where police are raiding a house without the reisdent's permission and seizing their fiat or physical assets they're taking the assets by force. If the police bother to knock and nobody answers, they kick in the door and force their way in. Anyone trying to stop them is restrained by force at best, or injured, or killed. There's a safe full of money? The resident can either willingly give them the code or they can try to break into the safe by force. If they can't enter the safe, they'll deny the resident access to the safe. It's the same with Bitcoin, I'm sorry. There's no difference. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 09:10:14
Lol. Well, it's posted on bch and btc as well, so we'll have to wait and see what the poll says!
@_date: 2018-05-11 17:00:04
I mean, I think Satoshi kept their identity a secret for the protection of the project, not the creator. Having a face of the currency would create a single point of weakness \- if Satoshi had any kind of criminal history, political views of any kind, etc, it would create divisiveness among the community. "That con is for lefties/righties!" for example.
Plus, Satoshi would be vulnerable to being framed by any of the many institutions threatened by Bitcoin for unsavoury activity \- character assassination to discredit the movement. No face = no point of weakness. It's decentralized!
That's what the name means. Satoshi = "clear minded one", Nakomoto = "one who comes from the centre".
@_date: 2018-05-21 14:53:18


How do they take it? By force.
I don't understand the difference. Police don't ask permission to seize assets, ever. They're given a warrant, they enter the premises where cash, for example, is located and take/seize/forcefully remove it. Those all mean the exact same thing.
If they can't find it and the owner won't give it up, they'll search until they find it, same as private keys. If someone has their keys committed to memory and nowhere else I would imagine that they would be denied computer access, like with most instances of cybercrime. 
\&gt;All these news articles about "seizing" BTC are just a part of huge manipulation of masses to give the idea that Bitcoin can be seized as usual other fiat money. **It is not**. 
Anything's possible, although seeing as criminals use Bitcoin to store funds just like anyone else I think it's more likely that the police arrested someone storing laundered money on the Bitcoin network and seized his funds. Criminals laundering fiat currency have their funds seized all the time, I see no reason to doubt that this story isn't true.
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:11:20
People are still holding Bitcoin, and major stock exchanges are opening Bitcoin trading desks. Can I ask if you had some and decided to get out? How come?
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:21:50


I personally think Satoshi remained anonymous to further decentralize the currency. Their ethnicity and political views would become part of the Bitcoin narrative, any criminal history would be associated with Bitcoin, and any government or agent in the world could try and frame them for some awful crime to discredit the entire project. It's a single point of weakness.
I think with altcoins, having a known founder is one thing, but Bitcoin is *the* cryptocurrency and the project that introduced blockchain to the world. There's a lot at stake, and enemies of the cryptospace would be constantly trying to twist their words or dig up dirt on them to harm Bitcoin at the very least.
It's in the name: **Satoshi, meaning "clear\-minded"**, and **Nakomoto, meaning "one who comes from the centre."**
Someone with a clear vision and no point of origin, or originating from the very centre with no distinguishing characteristics \- truly decentralized.

I mean, this part is empirically false right off the bat. No reputable scientists believe that the currency data testing racial IQs is reflective of "genetic intelligence", those tests were mostly carried out by white scientists decades ago, often during or as a response to the US civil rights movement. So trying to argue that black people are stupid \(especially based off of "scientific" findings\) is pretty unpleasant to say the least. 
The immigration thing is more of an opinion \- it's not one that I share, but I don't feel the need to get into that. Based on what I just read I think to say this guy's views are "bordering" on white supremacy is a huge understatement. Like the person who pointed that out, I'm of the opinion that if someone wants to be a supremacist, let them. They're entitled to their views like anyone else, doesn't mean we have to agree with them.

The funds have actually been sezied and transferred to a wallet controlled by Israeli police, according to the article, much like electronic fiat currency is seized.

@_date: 2019-08-15 15:59:56
The point people are making here in the thread is that someone who has tattooed a Bitcoin symbol or QR code to their skin comes across as someone who might be heavily invested. There were 23 reported cases of forced Bitcoin robbery in the last year IIRC, and many of them were Youtube traders who were visibly doing well. People keep an eye out for that kind of thing.
It's not a big issue if you don't store a lot of money in that wallet. I spoke with the CEO of a Bitcoin ATM company, Martin Wismeijer, who has a [subdermal Bitcoin implant.]( He used to store his BTC in there, and then announced the implant as a PR move - but when he did that, he took almost all of the BTC out, and made a point of saying so. He did that because he didn't want people to kidnap him and literally cut the implant out of his hand or force him to transfer the funds, which is *exactly* what would have happened - it would be very naive to think otherwise.
Like I've said before in the thread, I don't think OP is at a high risk of getting robbed, just that they're at a much higher risk now than before. A QR tattoo with a lot of funds would be a hell of a lot worse. Let's say your blog was super well-known and it had, say, $60k in the wallet for everyone to see. Do you honestly think that would be safe? People would find out who you are, what your situation is, and consider travelling to your location to rob you, no question. And there are people walking around with a *lot* more than $60k in their wallets.
@_date: 2018-06-20 09:07:14

@_date: 2018-06-26 12:34:45
I'm not saying Bitcoin is a scam, I'm just saying asking if you should buy Bitcoin in the Bitcoin sub isn't going to get OP a very objective answer - best to do it in a community where everyone supports cryptocurrency but there isn't a unanimous consensus on Bitcoin. People might recommend altcoins, ICOs, or simply not investing at this time in crypto, and it's good to weigh up those opinions against the ones here to make an informed decision.

Do you mean bags of BCH? I don't own any, never have, and I really don't trhink I said anything that would make someone think otherwise there so I'm not really sure what you're getting at with your comment.
If you don't see the problem with theymos and this subreddit, I suggest you look into it, and if you don't think sockpuppets and shills are active on both r/bitcoin and r/btc as well as throughout the cryptocurrency space, I can tell you as a professional working in cryptocurrency media full-time that you're quite *badly* mistaken, that's been a major issue for years and it's getting a lot worse I'm afraid.

@_date: 2018-06-20 08:58:54
You're right! I'm wrong about the censorship, totally wrong.
In terms of brigading, that's true of r/bitcoin as well, you can't support BCH here without being downvoted (or banned, more likely) and you can't support BCT in r/btc without being downvoted as well.
I really don't like the r/btc community or subreddit, but I think this one has incredible problems that are often glanced over. Theymos is a sinister figure in the space IMO, and the censorship, condemnation of pro-bch companies, and other non-neutral actions are really against what I view as the core values of Bitcoin as it was originally envisioned.
Anyway, yes, my bad about the r/btc censorship comment! Changing it now
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:32:51
Those all indicate that you're wealthy, but most people store their wealth in fiat. You can walk someone to an ATM and take out a grand or whatever, but you can't force a bank transfer of all their money at gunpoint because it's reversable and takes days.
Bitcoin tatts aren't a good idea in my opinion either - the amount of home invasions where people have been tortured for their BTC has increased a lot lately, it's all over the news. I think it's fair to assume that someone with a big tattoo about BTC volatility has a decent investment in i, and there's no way to reverse the instant transaction if you get robbed. It's not super common, but why make it much more likely, you know?

When you say "made up problem", is that because you're unaware of the increasing number of people being robbed for disclosing that they hold Bitcoin? I'm not sure where you're coming from, you're either trying to be obtuse or you just haven't read the thread yet.
@_date: 2019-04-01 17:37:02
Someone is unlikely to break into your house and torture you for the keys to your supercar (very traceable, difficult to sell, etc).
But that happens all the time for crypto, especially in the last year or so, and once you transfer someone's cryptocurrency to your own wallet it's a relatively simple matter of sending it to a DEX and buying Monero, using a mixing service, etc. Nearly untraceable, and redeemable for cash.
@_date: 2019-04-01 23:03:59
I specifically said that I was talking about tens or hundreds of thousands, not 2k, although people get mugged for less all the time.
If a local gang thinks you have a few grand in your house, they have a good reason to break in and steal it. $1000 an hour is pretty good money, and seeing as the vast, vast majority of robberies and kidnappings go unsolved, it's not like they're likely to get caught or do any prison time in this (hypothetical) situation. Not one of the armed Bitcoin robberies I linked above was solved, for example, and they probably never will be.
@_date: 2019-04-01 19:09:33
No, it actually only holds true for cash, cryptocurrencies, gold, other non-fungible assets like diamonds that can be easily transported in your pocket. If you keep several hundred grand worth of diamonds or gold bullion in your house, I would give you the same advice of not broadcasting that info.
You can, in most cases, steal someone's cryptocurrency or cash in minutes and leave them with no recourse of ever getting it back. On the other hand, someone who is rich but not known to have their assets in crypto or cash can't just be robbed for thousands or millions of dollars on the spot - bank transfers take days and can be reversed, crypto transactions don't and can't.
@_date: 2019-04-02 11:37:24
With your particular multi-sig setup, how do you ever withdraw, trade, or spend cryptocurrency? Do you contact those people and ask them to co-sign a transaction?
@_date: 2019-04-10 18:49:07
It literally is gambling. I personally believe Bitcoin is likely to increase in fiat value, but I'm not an economist, and even economists agree that investing in Bitcoin is a risk.
@_date: 2019-04-02 22:37:00
Every person in the 5 news stories I linked used the exact same systems as your describing, and they all got robbed. Four of them had keys stashed on hidden devices that nobody knew about. They were tortured by people demanding thousands of dollars - they denied that they had money, maybe coughed up somw decoy funds, but when they were tortured, they gave up their funds, like anyone would. You would too, and if it takes *a few hours* to transfer nearly untraceable funds, the criminals will be happy to wait.
The fifth victim was just one co-signee on a wallet holding keys to huge amounts of funds. He was kidnapped and successfully ransomed for $1 million. Your family would give up your crypto if you were kidnapped, and if one of your co-signees were kidnapped, you would probably do the same - there are more areas of attack there, not less.
In both cases, you're far less vulnerable to hacking (well-done), but completely open to being robbed through force. A single, unarmed person could conceivably enter your house and rob you of literally 100% of your crypto funds, very very easily. More easily if they were armed and/or brought a friend, and there are *plenty* of people who would do that for just a few measly grand. You could easily be robbed of everything in a home invaion or kidnapping, your funds are only safe from online attack. 
For offline attacks, the best security system is not advertising the fact that you have a lot of cryptocurrency, unless some of it goes towards bodyguards.
I would delete everything you've just written if I were you, no idea why you thought you could "never" be robbed when your security measures are the exact same as those of all the people who were recently robbed. There's no harm in being careful with your money and personal safety.

Cryptocurrency trading isn't a 50/50 game though. With a coin toss, betting the black on roulette, etc, the odds are 50/50, no variables. It's unusual to see black 30 times in a row.
With trading, there are endless variables. Sure, it'll "either go up or down", but not with 50/50 odds. You could see a downward trend last weeks, months, years, when permanently. No bankroll is big enough to guarantee success there. 
Plus, the trading price is artificially manipulated. It's never a 50/50 bet. People can succeed with technical analysis, but not by just doubling down on losses.

You can, but if you do it to someone holding fiat, the best you can hope for is usually a small amount of cash. if they're using a bank, maybe walk them to an ATM and take out a few grand, tops. What else can a thief do, make you put a wire transfer through? It could be traced, and it could take days to go through, and reversed in the meantime (unless you've been kidnapped for days or a loved one is being held hostage, in which case you've got bigger problems).
With crypto, you can set up a wallet on a burner phone, force someone to instantly transact thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions to your wallet and distribute the sum to different wallets, putting it through heightened anonymity systems like Monero, etc. Can't be reversed, very difficult to trace (impossible really if it's planned well), and there's no third party that will intervene in the transaction. Decentralized anonymity works both ways.

Well, he's a Muslim cleric, and Sharia law is based on precedents \(much like the legal system of most countries\). Nobody represents it widely really, there's no main leader \- Sharia is a school of thought and sometimes contradictory rulings moreso than a strict and unified set of rules, and this ruling is the first one to declare Bitcoin "Halal" or permitted.
It's not so much a presidential decree as the ruling of an individual judge setting a precedent \(permanently\), and that precedent is all any devout Muslim who was interested in crypto but holding off for religious reasons needs to jump in. Put it this way \- if we're not Muslim and *we* heard about this, you can be sure it made a big impression in the extremely affluent Muslim world as well. 
The ruling in Jakarta came out as a huge conference of Islamic scholars is convening in Bahrain as well to discuss the exact same thing, whether cryptocurrencies are money \(check the article, it's really short\).
This is a big issue for a large portion of the world's population, and you can be sure that it will impact the market as a whole.

That is literally the entire focus of the article, with direct quotes from Binance spokespeople including the CEO relaying that exact information.
The title doesn't even mention or hint at other fiat pairings, you have to read the article to get to that part, and in the article it simply quotes the Binance CEO on the topic with no bias or angle whatsoever.
I'm always open to feedback on my work, but in this case I can't agree with you. This is unbiased reporting with no implication of anything other than the facts. Again, if you don't like the title, you can take it up with C\_Z himself, because he's the one who wrote it and I actually provided more context than his tweet by combining it with an earlier statement. I appreciate that people are unhappy to hear about this \- don't shoot the messenger. It's important to get the facts right, and articles like this will help, not harm.

I don't see what you mean to be honest \- the Quran was written a long time ago, and the point of giving scholars the ability to debate modern issues and make non\-binding rulings is to give the belief system the ability to adapt and change over time. I don't know if there's an excerpt in the Quran about social acceptance of currencies, there are multiple fatawas concering that issue though, which is why it's considered to be a mainstream concept in Islamic Canonical Law/Sharia law.
@_date: 2018-04-14 11:50:43
Ohhhh, OK. You don't like religion and you're trying to argue the existence of God with me. I think I'll pass, thanks! I stopped having strong feelings about that years ago. The article is a practical one about influential people and the huge, huge amount of money in the Islamic banking world. To answer your question, if it was a serious question, the Islamic scholars convening to discuss cryptocurrencies are the people who make the rules of this particular religion, and literally all organized religions are run by people who make and (thankfully) change the rules as time goes on.
If what you want to talk about is how you don't like Muslims or believe in their God, that is a very, very different topic, and not one that I brought up here or in the article. Try for that kind of thing, this is just a news story about a current issue in cryptocurrency.

The article explicitly gives the reasons why currencies like the US dollar are Halal - government mandate and social acceptance. Either would do, the USD has both (and yes, they do deal in USD).

Well, that part of the title is literally a direct quote from a Binance spokesperson, so you'll have to take it up with them .
I don't think it's misleading at all, and Zhao has said that while they're working with banks to **potentially** introduce fiat pairs, they currently have no plans to include the USD as one of those fiat pairs. This is all in the article and taken direct from source.
I'm aware that a lot of people don't want to hear this, but it's important to combat fake news regardless of whether or not the lie was preferable.

So you think religions should never change, ever? Humans hadn't harnessed electricity when the Quran was written, things change.

What? I'm not Muslim, I'm not talking about any deity, I'm talking about the rules of the organised religion in question here. You know \- the one led by actual humans?
I responded to your comment about USD being Haram, which it isn't \- it's Halal and backed by multiple religious rulings. This is a group of people we're talking about here, it categorically is a philosophy as well as a religion \- Sharia is a school of thought influenced by many different living scholars.


I have literally no idea what you're talking about here, there isn't a single mention of gods or deities in the article \- this is about a group of influential people discussing the acceptance of Bitcoin \- it's regulation, not theology.

\&gt; I thought that Bitcoin is a currency and not a commodity 
Bitcoin is a currency, an asset class, a commodity, and none of the above depending on who you ask. In Islam it's  being viewed as a currency, which is the sole focus of the article. Did you mean to write that the other way around, you thought it was a commodity and not a currency?

One of the big issues here is major Muslim companies \(like the Indonesian FinTech company in the article\) that can't be seen to be publicly investing in Bitcoin if it goes against their religious beliefs. The new ruling isn't universal, but it gives them the precedent they've been waiting for to justify investing in Bitcoin, which could bring a lot of new money to the space.
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:20:50
That's definitely true, hence the word "potential". Even if all Muslims followed one doctrine, which they don't, it would be like expecting every Christian to invest in Bitcoin because the pope said to. Only a fraction will, just like only a fraction of any nation's population invest in Bitcoin.
The reason it's a big deal is 1, now any Muslims that follow Sharia law who wanted to invest but couldn't *can* invest, they have their precedent.
2: A lot of hugely wealthy individuals and businesses follow Sharia law, and obviously want to get in on crypto trading but again, they couldn't until now. Only a fraction will invest, but we're talking about a very wealthy fraction here, the businesses especially could be a big deal and bring more money into the market \(I think it already has\).
@_date: 2019-05-09 09:01:23
Unless you think that [only 10%]( of the world's population will ever use cryptocurrency, anyone with crypto now is (as I said) a relatively early adopter.
I think you took what I was saying to mean *"anyone buying in now is guaranteed to make money!"*, and that's not what I'm saying. Just pointing out that people with crypto now are in the vast minority, and that the level of investment in cryptocurrency is likely to increase a lot over the coming decades IMO. Crypto (and blockchain technology) is still in it's infancy.

There's evidence that someone bought pizza in 2010 with Bitcoin, we already know that it's true. If you think BTC was used to buy real-world goods before that it's on you to provide evidence, not the person you're trying to convince.
@_date: 2019-05-17 11:01:45
Now *this* is adoption.
@_date: 2019-05-22 12:02:52
No, the person referred to as "Pizza Guy" here is Laszlo Hanyecz, an early Bitcoin developer who spent 10,000 BTC on pizza in 2010 (market value for the pizza at the time). It's the first recorded transaction involving BTC spent on a real-world product. Pizza Guy isn't just some randomer, he' had more contact with Bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakomoto than most people and did a lot for the project.
The person who delivered the pizza wasn't a pizza shop owner, it was an 18-year-old called  Jeremy Sturdivant. Maybe I misunderstood, were you asking if Sturdivant lost the BTC? He didn't, [he sold them for a few hundred dollars]( and went on a trip (they were worth way more than the two pizzas when he sold and selling them is what any reasonable person would have done).

I'm pretty sure Warren Buffet called it a Ponzi scheme at one point.
@_date: 2019-05-17 11:09:46
In your country would you have to pay income tax on the BTC before cashing it out though? I would think not, it's probably more that if/when you sell it for fiat you then pay income and capital gains tax on it.
It's probably fairly straightforward to spend some of that BTC on Monero and then sell it OTC to someone else in private.

Just citing the Kapersky Labs research that I linked. The Global Blockchain Council states that [5% of Americans]( hold Bitcoin.
But if the point that you're trying to make is that *less* than 10% of the world's population use cryptocurrency, then that's all the more reason to  consider current users early adopters.
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:29:12
That is the 20% that is literally never accounted for. It's the IRS estimate of people who get away with tax evasion and are never caught. Most people who fudge their income tax get away with it, just read the links. That's all I've got to say on it, good luck.

That's interesting, I wonder if it's the same where I am. I assume it's based on the USD market value of the Bitcoin at the time of receiving it?


Oh, for sure. I was just speculating on whether the NFL player was indeed trying to game the tax system and how he might go about doing that. If it's the case that trading BTC for Monero triggers a tax event then it's irrelevant though.
@_date: 2019-05-09 08:32:45
I would agree with them, that part's true.
The mainstream financial ecosystem is also full of all of those things, on a much wider scale. There are better protections built in to traditional finance, and it's important to acknowledge that, but it's definitely possible to educate yourself on crypto, tread carefully, and become a relatively early adopter of a promising new technology and monetary system. There are risks, as with everything.
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:39:05
I think you misunderstood what I was saying. There's no way to accurately count the vast number of Americans who successfully dodge taxes and never get caught (because they never get caught), but that doesn't mean that there are no estimates. The US government believes that [close to half a trillion dollars is permanently lost to tax evasion]( every year (this is the figure that is not subsequently recovered in tax audits).
Putting that another way, the IRS estimates that [19% of US income is not reported]( The IRS are certainly diligent, but they catch a minority of tax evaders, not the majority (same with the police and crime in any country).

I'm not too up to speed on DEX's at the moment, is there a decent DEX where you can trade Bitcoin for Monero or Zcash and back again? Does anyone know? That seems like a good way to prevent an exchange trying to blame you for the coin's transaction history.

Way beyond that, he was one of the first ever Bitcoin developers! 
I see a lot of posts about him that call him "pizza guy" and not "[Laszlo Hanyecz]( early Bitcoin developer who collaborated with Satoshi Nakomoto to make multiple contributions to the code of the world's first cryptocurrency."
The guy was in direct contact with Satoshi and helped create Bitcoin as well as being the first person ever to use it to buy a real-world product, and he paid the fair market price for that product at the time.
