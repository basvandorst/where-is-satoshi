Why do you intermingle your personal and business accounts with bitcoin flowing through both? Yea you should be worried. Why don't you have a contingency plan?

If anarchy worked reddit wouldn't exist.

What a naive thing to say. If anyone has any advantage tech wise they will use it to further their own cause or hurt their competitors. Look at ultra high speed trading if you would like a financial example. A more prominent example would be the atomic bomb. What you speak of is a Utopia--unrealistic. There will always be disparity in the world. There will be bitcoin barons and bitcoin grovelers. Bitcoin does nothing to change wealth only hold it (in fiat money too). Bitcoin has a couple of problems world wide; a vast majority of those effected by income inequality (those in poor countries) don't have a computer let alone a phone. We're talking a huge portion of the planet. How can they utilize Bitcoin? On top of this, most people don't like change. A sad but true fact. Bitcoin users hover at around 4m (being generous). This isn't enough to cause a "paradigm shift". I'm sorry. Also what about competing cryptos and the whole arbitrary nature of cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin may not remain king. Being pragmatic and realistic, Bitcoin's future doesn't look bright.

Infrastructure = electricty/power plant/lines, etc.
And I agree people need zero education to learn how to use and operate bitcoin to not scammed. Yep. Let me meet those people. I could do a deal with them for their bitcoins. You're argument is hogwash.

They'll all need computers or a phone first and the education to use them. You wanna provide that?
@_date: 2014-04-04 13:12:39
Just as bad pretty much. Not as, but pretty close.

There is no such thing as a "free market". Isn't that the point of Bitcoins creation? To escape fees and regulation?
Edit: That phone is $25-50. A vast majority of the planet doesn't make that in several months. They also need to pay for electricity and service. You're argument is paradoxical. You hope to achieve a free market through massive adoption of bitcoin yet invoke it's usefulness (free markets) in the implementation of bitcoin.

Not in the *third world*. Did you read his comment? By the way, they have neither.

I smell a buying opportunity!

Again, idealistically; thats awesome! Now stop ignoring my main point.
*Who is going to pay for it?*
And that's just the first hurtle. Then you need infrastructure. Then you need to educate. All of them. That costs more money. See where I'm getting at?
Also, why would they use bitcoin as opposed to a bank without any prior knowledge?
Hell, we only have 4m users of bitcoin in industrialized nations! How do we expect to get more in *third world* countries. Common dude be pragmatic.
@_date: 2014-04-05 19:07:07
Yes, that is one aspect. Good job.
@_date: 2014-04-05 15:26:24
Still costs money. Money they don't have. They don't grow on trees bro.

Anarchy is a human construct. How can you apply it to nature?
@_date: 2014-04-04 22:31:15
Yea and we certainly can't draw parallels to Mt.Gox and a corrupt bank, right? Right guys?
