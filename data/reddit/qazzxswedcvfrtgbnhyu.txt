Nah, he was totally trying to pay for 2 months of my internet bill. ;)

Doesn't this allow for that theoretical attack with only 1/4th the network?
Where a pool doesn't publish the found block, and waits till they find the next one, perpetually keeping themselves in the lead, securing blocks for themselves?

I'm sitting here reading through all these bittip comments, laughing my ass off at how bizarre reddit has become.
 
I guess this is the reddit version of making it rain.

It very well could, it just needs to be demonstrated.
Which would be easy enough if a few gathered some dusty mining equipment and hopped on the testnet.
But so far, it hasn't been demonstrated, so nobody takes it seriously.

The trust comes from the fact that [with the precedent set by the SEC] you can't just scam people [using bitcoin as a medium] without consequences.
Previous to this, people assumed the government wouldn't care about bitcoin fraud as they could just deem it "play money".
The government is, at least for now, protecting bitcoin investors.

This in incredibly fascinating.
Could we get a bunch of willing to work on this to run some desktop testnet clients?
1. Get a hundred or so miners on testnet (i'm sure enough people with erupters, and outdated graphics cards would be willing to do this for a week)
2. Create a pool 1/4 the power of the network
3. (I don't actually know how pooled mining works, but this would require a patched pool server)?
4. See if we could reliably demonstrate the attack.

You lost me...
Unless the goods you produce are something like a pure resource, ie gold or oil, they devalue themselves over time.
My 2006 macbook definitely isn't worth more today that it was when I bought it...
Canned tomatoes from 1913 are definitely worth less than canned tomatoes from 2013? Right?

LibreOffice is so fucking polished, I love it.
I feel like a heathen for using Abiword.

But the volumes are different.

That scenario rests on far to many assumptions.
They're prosecuting a fraudster. 
Bitcoin is associated with shadyness because of fraudsters like pirate. 
The SEC stepping in creates more trust and accountability in the bitcoin ecosystem.

Well it *is* a trader, so when it sends all your coins to a foreign address it's doing exactly as advertised. ;)
But seriously, the sourcecode is in a .rar which I'm not gonna touch. *Very unprofessional*.

How is that so?

So maybe it shouldn't be a suicide hotline, but a gambling addiction hotline?
