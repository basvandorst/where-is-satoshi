I would be curious as to what right, practically speaking, consists of "absolute" freedom (excepting any rights you might have living as a hermit, with no contact whatsoever between others).  Free speech?  Try emailing a death threat to the President and see what happens.  Freedom of assembly?  Not in a riot.  Right to security of the person?  Not if you're under arrest.  The right to swing your fist freely?  Not when you swing it intentionally into my face.  
In answer to your question, I would suggest that it's clearly moral to violate property rights in many circumstances.  An extreme example would be the police coming onto your property and into your house while you're opening fire on passersby.  Continuing that example, I don't think many people would seriously argue that in addition to a violation of your property rights, violation of your right to security of the person (either by shooting or arresting you, depending on the circumstances) would be called for.


They might, but they might also accept it if the alternative is "more" evil.  So, even if taxation is "theft," and therefore evil (which I'm not conceding) it might still be preferable to the alternative (no roads, schools, fire departments, etc).  Based on your post, I don't think that you, personally, would believe that it's preferable, but that doesn't mean that society as a whole hasn't made this evaluation and come to the other conclusion.
Edit: punctuation and clarity
