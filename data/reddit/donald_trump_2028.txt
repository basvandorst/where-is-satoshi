Yes, because the US government has never seized 144,336 bitcoins.
Or the Japanese government that seized 200k bitcoins from Mt. Gox(of which they are letting the criminal Mark Karpeles keep nearly $1 billion dollars worth of)

Not a net gain.  Who will now buy bitcoin (as a buy and HODL investment) when you can just put the money into bitcoin futures and profit 10 fold off bitcoin moves?   Oh, you just made a 100% return in a week holding bitcoin?  I just made a 1,000% return in the same week with bitcoin futures and I don't have to put up as much money as you.
Everyone will sell bitcoin to buy bitcoin futures now.

They put up less money to control a full bitcoin.  Example would be if you have $10k, you can buy 1 bitcoin, but with futures $10k might control 100 bitcoins.  So if bitcoin goes from $10k to $15k, you made $5k, but if you hold 1 future of bitcoin, you've made $500k.   
This of course is an oversimplification and I have no idea how much a bitcoin futures contract is going to be worth.  1 contract of gold is 100 oz so I just kind of went off that 100 number, but maybe a bitcoin contract will control less.  Can't imagine it will be less than 10 bitcoins though.

Whether the price goes to $50k, or $500, this meme is probably going to age well in 5 years.

The enthusiasm in bitcoin right now is very similar to the enthusiasm in real estate in 2004-2005.  No one seems to be sober on what the future actually holds for bitcoin.  They're all drunk on "Bitcoin will keep going up!"   Ok...so who's going to buy bitcoin at $100k, or $1m?   Big money hedge funds?  Are they going to hold out for $10m then?   Who's going to buy at $10m?  Aliens?
Big money is looking for big returns and all the big money is already in.  They're now just selling to the small money who thinks there is more big money to get in

Yes, there is a minimum margin you have to maintain.   For example, if you want to buy 100 oz of gold(about $125,000), you need to maintain $4900 in your account.  2 contracts or $250k of gold, you'd need $9,800.

So it seems the last time he moved it, it was worth $30 million so he knew he had a lot of money.

This needs to be in How this only has 1615 points right now is beyond me.

So what you're saying is that bitcoin is about to lose 90% of its value and not even start trying to recover for 10 years at which point it will then increase 100 fold.  Is that what you're saying?   Are you saying sell everything now and start buying back slowly over the next 10 years to make a huge amount of money?  Because that's what it looks like you're saying with this chart.
