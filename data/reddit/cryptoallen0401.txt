`After seeing the manpower that was poured into Bitcoin and Blockchain development, the Education that was offered and the overall praise of Bitcoin in general – I want to hold.`
`I believe with the next halving in May 2020, the real Bullrun will come if the Stars align. When some form of governmental recognition and an easy to use application for buying is in place till then, we will see a hopefully meteoric rise. If average joe can buy Bitcoin easy with an App and the Media picks up the hype.`  
I really agree on what you have said regarding why you are still holding. I know that Crypto itself is just like all speculations, but the way you have explained everything is very informative! And also you have mentioned that a good app or platform is important to bring the hype again. So as of now, you don't have any platform or projects in mind that can accomplish this?

This is true. After the issue with Bitconnect, investors became very careful and smart when it comes to investing. Today's era on cryptocurrency is not like before when new investors or old investors just go FOMO. Even new investors know how to research for projects that would really add value or secured. What do you think about other projects or apps like [this]( ? I mean there are a lot of projects that are using Blockchain, do you think this will help the current market?  Or even the entire cryptospace itself?
