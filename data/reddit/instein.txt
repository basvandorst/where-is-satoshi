Sorry not fully clued up here. I understand there is bcash  and bgold which I can claim on my 5yo bitcoin. What is gbytes and lumen. Are they forks from bitcoin? Do they work the same way as bcash in the sense that I can claim some? Are there other forks like that? Would this new fork work the same way?

Awesome, thank you so much for that. The thought of having to download the 100Gb plus block chain on my 3mb/s link and then having it be corrupted so I have to do it again several times horrifies me. 
I guess if this is possible it may also be possible to just transfer the public key to a web based exchange and use the password to get access to the bitcoin. 
I actually have a target amount that I'm waiting for but once that is reached, I want to get the cash asap.

When you refer to the private key, are you referring to the password/passphrase?

How do I go about getting my private key out of my wallet? I have a bitcoin core qt wallet. Is there a bunch of steps or a utility I use to get the private key out?
I have had these coins for about 5 years, brought in at about $42. Like everyone wish I had brought more and spent less. So if I cash in, I should be up for about 10% extra? That's awesome!! How would I go about claiming that?
Also have some Cassius coins, can I get the 10% on those? They are also about 5 years old. Are Cassius any more valuable? I know I paid a bit extra for them at the time but I'm doubtful that makes much difference now.

Would I have to go on an exchange to do that or could I just do it from the wallet on my computer? I want to avoid using an exchange.

You didn't miss anything of value, unless you wanted to know what someone spews out when high.

If you bought 5 bitcoin and waited 10 years, you will be a multi millionaire. If you are like most people, you probably don't have a lazy $40k lying around. Never mind, just buy as much as you can comfortably afford and then buy a bit more with every pay check. Even if it goes up, keep buying. Cash out when it is enough for you to be comfortably financially independent for the rest of your life.
  
To give you an idea of the gains, I'm predicting (based on past performance) it to go to ~$260 000 end 2021/start of 2022. Is that enough to excite you? Then we will dip sharply again to $50k to $70k before next run up to well over a million dollars in 4 years after that. A single bitcoin could change your life.

Actually it is 12.5 times the ath of $20k so at around $10k its more like 25 times whores...

The world is awash with money which is why interest rates are so low. We haven't seen that translate into inflation but that may be because it is put into investments but if those don't pay off, then the whole thing could crumble and we could experience a sudden huge inflation bubble which would smash the value if currencies around the world. If currencies fell to 1% of their current value, savings would be recked and 100x increase in the value if bitcoin would only leave it at level to the value it is now.

Pretty sure you have to buy from an exchange based in Australia. If you haven't done that, you could be in deep shit...

Not in Australia, we have $24 000 per year pension and free medical.
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:59:26
It needs to be in a wallet dedicated to you super but other than that as long as you just let it sit there, you should be just fine.

I am using a company called esuperfund. They charge around $900 per year to help you manage it. It is much easier this way. I have around 300 pages of documents related to this so am glad I didn't try do it on my own. My expectation is that I will make more than enough in increased value of my Bitcoin to easily cover the cost of the service. I do however have enough cash in the SMSF to cover costs if bitcoin doesn't per as expected.

Can confirm that government pension in Australia is quite generous paying around $24 000 per year. If you own your own home, you can live quite well on this. You also get free medical here and plenty of concession prices on things like rates and car registration, train fares etc.

Australian government pension is $24 000 per year, he's not gonna starve... Oh and medical here is free.

I have done very similar, however I have only put a part (minority) of my super into the SMSF and I also purchased around 4 btc. I believe that it should be part of my super but I'm not ready to risk all of it. Only the future will tell me if I have done the right thing. It would have been nice if the super providers offered it as an option.
