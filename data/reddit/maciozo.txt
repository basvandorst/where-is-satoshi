I guess they want in on the same PR action that Apple got.

Not as annoying as when someone puts "Fact." at the end of a statement.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:45:40
But couldn't this be done with altcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:20:16
Why deli meats and sausages?
Aren't deli meats just sliced cooked meat? And sausages just minced meat in a cylindrical shape?

Don't all blocks pay 12.5 BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:27:13
Oh right. Sorry!
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:51:39
Exactly. Why does every new character have to be an emoji?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:58:48
Sure, but is it necessary? You could just as easily use the bitcoin character in a conversation or wherever.

At what point does meat become processed? Isn't cooking a process?
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:40:29
Which line is which?

Isn't it possible to use foreign exchanges? 
@_date: 2016-01-09 02:36:12
@_date: 2016-01-09 02:35:45
Thanks! A bit of a shame about the lack of chip though.
@_date: 2016-01-08 22:17:09
Is there anything like this for the UK?

What's wrong with using a VPN?
@_date: 2016-12-31 14:20:44
Wow, bet they had to put some overtime in for that one
@_date: 2016-11-26 01:53:20
Surely anything is large enough to contain explosives
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:42:08
Shit, guys! It's all over!
@_date: 2015-07-03 11:44:39
Also makes Bitcoin look like a company or business.
@_date: 2016-02-08 16:23:42
You know, if the world was filled with people like you, nobody would ever be able to find out the answer to anything.
@_date: 2016-09-20 00:01:22
Well, you do get a t-shirt and a hardware wallet. Not really the right use of the term "donation" though, since you're getting something in return.

Could the QR code not have been stylised a bit to for in with the rest of the design?
@_date: 2015-10-26 16:17:35
Apps from my bank won't run on a rooted phone. I don't know about others, though.

What does this have to do with Brexit?
