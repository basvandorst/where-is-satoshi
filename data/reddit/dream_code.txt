Web based point of sale for cryptocurrencies.  CheckoutCrypto.com
We sought any assistance we could obtain for our business at the first bank (including the possibility of a loan and/or account), the second bank we only sought a basic business account.  We are even prepared to incorporate if necessary, just to meet the bank and other money processor's obligations.

Apparently, one must be high to understand the conditions of the market.  Look at the price of BTC.  Companies can't get bank accounts, loans, or even partnerships with larger institutions, due to intense pressure to prevent risk.  The few companies who have the licensing and agreements, aren't going to campaign politically to change anything because this "walled garden" is exactly where they want it!

No most don't have/need all the licensing or adhere to FINTRAC. When you refer to ATM do you mean bitcoin ATM? I heard that too recently, how many are following FINTRAC?Anybody can buy an ATM for $800, that doesn't mean they have agreements to do deposits/withdrawals to banks across canada, or internationally, especially via interac online.  So let's be honest. I have yet to hear of a single banking institution offering such a price in Canada for that kind of risk.  But I could be wrong.

This really is a revolutionary concept.  The incentives, protocols, software, value, supply, nearly everything in the ecosystem of bitcoin would be effected.  I'm interested to see how this plays out.  Certainly a supporter of the concept, just being prudent about what others and my own  responsibilities could become, what exactly these changes will entail.

It's my understanding, a freshly mined coin, in your theory, would also be considered a "black coin". If "black coins" were unspendable due to regulation, wouldn't that be suggesting nobody can mine a single profitable coin if the coin isn't registered?  That's ridiculous. Their would be zero incentive for any miner to continue, the entire network would fail.  No more demand, no supply, no miners moving transactions.
It's completely counter intuitive, why would this happen?

@_date: 2014-10-27 22:42:38
Thank you for responding,  If I understand correctly, value is maintained when you move coins, I'm just not completely understanding how the sidechain is able to account for moved bitcoins to the sidechain.  Say for example, a coin only has 1 million coins created of 100 million, someone very fortunate happens to hold a ton of btc and can easily stake out 1 million of this exampled coin, with his own non-side chained BTC.  Does the coin now generate a total of 101 million coins over its lifetime, where does this 1 million sidechained coins come from? how will the example coin's, maximum amount of coins, generate, if the user leaves that example sidechain, goes back to BTC, will only 100 million coins now generate? OR did the sidechain determine, because of that and probable other moved transaction, it only needs to generate 99 million more coins to hit coins maximum supply.  
Wow a lot of variables.  This is how men lose hair.  Can imagine the fun people are having solving these problems.  
@_date: 2014-08-02 23:38:13
In that event, the foundation could be implicated for fraud, though it would be very difficult. Assuming they leveraged alleged Gox gains to get even more donations, while everyone suing Gox, got nothing.  The people continuing to donate/invest in the foundation would be the ones calling fraud I'd imagine.
@_date: 2014-07-18 09:33:25
Illegal to mine, without registering, is what you're saying.  Not likely.
I suggest you refer to the Canadian  Anti-Laundering regulations.  Transactions over $10,000 are all they care about.
edit: worth mentioning, they do require proof of identification and record keeping.
Still nothing about mining, likely won't be a for a long time if at all, or the entire currency would spin.
@_date: 2014-10-27 08:35:23
I have a few questions, if I move BTC to another chain, what if that chain hasn't mined enough overall coin to cover the value of that move? Where is that value derived from if not the miners, if that overall coin amount isn't significant? where does this new coin come from?  If it sits in your wallet, as the new side chain, how  was that value created?
@_date: 2014-08-29 01:33:58
Okay this is pathetic. This ends here.

That's the unfortunate cost of licensing, hosting, high-risk payment processing fees.  Most these brokers/exchanges aren't sitting on millions in the bank, much of it's reserved in crypto.  A lot goes into building an international payment system.  It takes years of lawyers, licensing, agreements and earned respect.  So that you're aware, despite their reputation and good-standing financially, CAVirtex is still likely considered a high-risk account and as such, likely they pay higher fees then most corporate accounts.  You can't blame CAVirtex for that, you can blame the oligopoly of a banking system we've all inherited.
The costs of licensing for the US alone are in the millions of $

The only reasoning, anyone has to offer here is "potcoin". Which is just as legal as bitcoin and has just as many uses. 
Would you care to share your wisdom?  In what world does calling someone a risk, make them a risk, without any evidence?
@_date: 2014-08-02 23:50:56
Yea the latter was my assumption, someone would have to try to prove that.  It's difficult, I don't agree with those allegations.  Probably have better luck if an email/chat log surfaces with regards to the alleged foundation and Gox payment.
@_date: 2014-08-29 16:39:58
It's only a flag, if you're ignorant, which these bankers are most certainly not.  Trying to turn it on potcoin is a fruitless endeavour.  [Here's the law in Canada]( which you remain oblivious to, citing evidence you continually claim anything marijuana related is a red flag.  I've also cited [evidence I meet all FINTRAC's obligations]( Therefore, you're incorrect.  I've already stated, I can add any coin, at any time, I choose not to, why? To prevent the same risk you're trying to claim upon potcoin!
@_date: 2014-08-28 15:33:17
Which part is a risk? That's the point.  They never stated (few days later, multiple attempts at communication) why that is. I have met all obligations under FINTRAC, who I'm also in contact with.
@_date: 2014-08-29 01:21:50
1) My business is not solely based on "narcotics" or "potcoin". I'm a software developer providing a solution to people who already exist legally in that business.
2) You're misleading everyone, if you think that's the cause for any claim of "risk" in my business.  From the beginning, each bank knew I was doing bitcoin and virtual currencies, the entire conversations were about that, not "potcoin", "narcotics", any other shit you can come up with.
I'm going to repeat, what's your interest? I see comments dating back 9 hours here.

Thank you for your patience and insight, I'm going to need to read more on this topic. I've misunderstood here if it's not the same as the native currency and represents tokens of coins for that currency(the specific chain being used).  I'm very curious how this translates to a sidechains supply. I mean the value of the coin itself is based on a coins supply and other factors, so if someone adds more coins from another chain, shouldn't that effect the amount of native currency created/mined ? Probably need to lurk moar here, thanks for the help.
@_date: 2014-08-02 23:28:21
Well, considering the investor, client, bankruptcy and market implications, any evidence they paid 1 or more people back and not the others who're suing, the foundation(recipients) could be held liable for conspiracy/collusion. In that event, Gox could definitely be liable for bankruptcy fraud. Though I'm unaware of the laws in Japan.

The trouble is, how am I to conduct business without a fiat account to pay taxes from?  A bank account is a requirement for any business.  I don't care if you're in bitcoin or gold mining.  I still must have an account to pay the bills.

Oh, we're doing metaphors for the impossible? It's very possible and it's not going to stop. 
 In reality, regulating bitcoin is like creating a walled garden, around a large, expensive, mansion.  Everyone(billions of people) who already lived in this metaphorical mansion are forced to moved out, the second the wall was built. Only a select few were allowed to enter or leave it.  Everyone else has to be invited by those few(who can afford the ridiculous licensing). In order for those few to even invite you, one must prove their ID, through personal/private documentation.  One's company must hold a certain amount of assets, proper filings, in order to even be considered.  If any of those people don't comply with these pre-conditional rules, they're all liable.  For everyone else who isn't invited, you're required to show ID, just to: show up at the house, look in the window, send/receive your own data(which will be shared, under the house rules).
I think that's a better analogy.

Unfortunately, potcoin is one of the few coins who showed me any support.  Just because they're the first coin in a list, and a partner, does not make them the entirety of my business. Especially when I can add a shitcoin in 2 minutes(with additional daemon sync) and choose not to.  It's really entertaining, watching people target potcoin.  Far be it for anyone to point out faces the same issue.  To ignore this problem, it would be a large mistake.

If you were sold on an IPO, for an exchange platform, I'm sorry for your loss.  Now anybody who can afford to can compete.
edit: This release has been heavily modified over a year, parts have been removed(bootstrap theme), as I need to seek permission from a past designer.  Furthermore, it's still under active development and all improvements are welcome.  Documentation being updated shortly, it can be purchased immediately, for a consulting/support fee.

Myself and my family are thankful for the resolution Shapeshift took during the Garza incident. If it were not for Shapeshift, one can only imagine the devastating effects that could have happened to us.  I can only wish, some day, to be [as proud]( of my son, as I am of Shapeshift. It brings me great happiness to see Shapeshift did not commit due diligence until after the scam was revealed, profiting the entire time. What a leader.

Which do you want?  The [worker]( it runs the backend, for all the daemon connections and rpc calls.
The [API]( is just a public connection to the worker and site.
The site(doesn't have theme, sorry), is built in drupal and contains everything needed to do what you're seeking to do.  I've been at this for over a year. 
The merchant clients(4 platforms) are available as well.

I do have a mobile repository, that I can release as well, it needs to be modified, it was in early stages.  As for QR codes, the site itself was mobile compatibile and scalable(with the appropriate theme).  The QR codes are seperate and yes, available for 2fa keys and for generating addresses across all CMS platforms listed(wordpress, drupal, opencart, dev tools).  Again, much has moved and changed, these are the base source code for the entire platform.
To gain a better understanding, [here's a diagram]( I made to describe the worker process.  Another [here]( to describe the merchant/affiliate/partner/mobile part of the platform.
