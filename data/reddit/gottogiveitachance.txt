Yeah, if someone ever asks for western union to transact payment, dont do it. It's always a scam. I've done 2 western union transaction and those were the biggest lessons in my life. They do it that way so you cant track them and report them when you realize you've just been scammed. Use a trusted exchange, or p2p bitcoin 3xchange if you want to do a person to person transaction. But never, I repeat never use western union for a transaction. Only way the bullshit company works is when your sending fiat overseas to family, and friends. Although I'm sure they know when the adoption is complete then they become useless. Then they'll cling to their Nigerian prince scams offering crypto, cars, birds, or God knows what for a price that is obviously to good to be true.

You don't get it do you? I grew up like this. There is always 5 dollars to spare. Shit almost all my neighbors were on well fare and they would always have 5 dollars for their beer. I HAD TO FUCKING SKIP MEALS BECAUSE WE DIDN"T HAVE ENOUGH FOR ANYONE TO FUCKING EAT. So don't tell me what I can't fucking do when this is the life I was born into you rich prick. This was me an every kid I grew up with. This is the kind of people I have gotten into it. The sad part is I have friend who give me this exact excuse for not getting in the game, and they are middle class who live up on a hill not even in the ghetto, the only debt they have is school debt and they say that takes all their money from being able to invest even 5 dollars, and yet every-time I'm over at their house, their getting weed that cost them over 60 dollars. There is always 5 dollars to spare if your willing to make room for it. The people who say there isn't, arn't willing to budget it in. So don't tell me I don't get it. I grew up here, still live here saving for my families escape and financial freedom. I know these people, these people know me, I've bought these peoples kids food when they couldn't. They make little money and they budget wrong, at least until I got them to put a little away and now their free from their credit relience that only further enslaved them financially.. Keep making excuses though and telling me I don't know about the fucking life I grew up in is like, the fucking life that lead me here, and has helped me and many others who live in the ghetto with me to escape the financial poverty life. Sure we still live here, but thankfully now credit card debt isn't syphoning all our income like it did all our parents lives forcing us to starve.

95k, thats cute. Here I'm only 25 with a mil in stock and quiet a bit more in crypto. You don't think crypto heads diversify too? Where do you think we put the money when we take a little off the top during ath's? And if it does die then fuck it, I put in only about 30k originally and have wasted more than that in my plenty of working years since I started working at 16. But at this point, it would be retarted not to keep a majority of my stake where it was created. I have enough elsewhere for a comfortable life, but if crypto continues the way it's going, then I'll have enough to build an empire. Well see who's right in 20 years. Just do me a favor, stay out of crypto, even if it hits a million just don't hop in, its not for you. Youd just sell everything after a 10x growth and miss out the long run. I know people like you, they don't do good in this space. Have plenty of friends who could have 10s of millions right now, but instead are only breaking 500k because they got scared and missed the jump everytime, having to hop back in each time for less and less

Volitility growing is still growth. I prefer it to my experience with an ever inflating fiat currency that exponentially devaluates on 2% of all the previous years 2%'s devaluations. I could get gas for less than a dollar when I was a kid, my dad bought houses for 30k. Now there isn't a single place where I live for under 500k. Gas is over 5 dollars. Any meal is 10 to 20 dollars. Meanwhile everyone is still earning the same mount of money that is worth less than what it was when they were earning the same amount of it 30 years ago. If it ever comes to a vote, what do you think people will choose? The money that forever is exponentially dieing? Or the money that exponentially grows.

Thanks! &amp; Yes now during the down market 80% of the last ath is a great time to buy. Keep buying even if it gets to 5k. You'll be thanking yourself when it's back to 20k. And if your patient enough to wait till 2040, you'll be thanking yourself for a very comfortable retirement. My greatest investment teacher taught us how during the 2006-2008 crash he moved on stocks with 16k he had saved up. By the time the market recovered he had made 6 million dollars, all before 2010. This is growing many times faster than what the stock market crash to recovery did for him.

I grew up in the ghetto to immigrant parents, that is the financial lifestyle I grew up in. I got these holdings with that lifestyle of income. My friends too, I got all of them in with this level of income living paycheck to paycheck some days not being able to eat meals, fuck, at one point I had to run to work and home 17 miles a day because I couldn't afford the gas to drive there 3 times a day for all my shifts. You know how we did it? 5 dollars a paycheck, 5 dollars a check we would throw in. That's how it grew to what we have now(I would explain to them that when they put that 5 dollars on a beer/joint/happy meal/carls Jr/pizza, it's gone, put that 5 dollars in a coin, and it's still there, even if it falls, it's still there just waiting to grow[call it the skip a beer investment plan]). This is why people will adopt, when the message goes out mainstream that people can put in so little and grow it into so much, they will do it. And when they see it grow, the smart ones will let it continue to grow till it can replace the credit cards they have that they can't even afford today because of the massive debt and bankrupcies that it has already caused them. Imagine a replacement to the debt scam that just fools people into impossible interest rates that grow faster than they can pay it? This is what has been done to the ghettos and middle class to indenture them into dept slavery, this is why it was created to free them from corrupt bank practices like this, once this message spreads of how they can escape their credit reliance and escape the interest trap, then like all those in the ghetto I have taught to escape that endepted life, the rest will to. The funniest part is out of all the people I've gotten into crypto, I've had a 100% success rate with the people I grew up with in the ghetto and those in my area to having them hold onto their crypto savings. You know who does pull out? The rich and upper middle class, they throw in 5k to 50k, money that to them is worth the equivalent of the 5 dollars the people in my area put in. At least 30% of the rich I get in take out their whole holdings when a market gets scary and either jump back in for less coins than those they sold, or stay away in fear of the market. But 100% of the lower class that I have gotten in has held. Even now if they use it, they replace it, it's their own personal credit card, with no interest, and when they pay it back they're insuring they keep this personal investment/bank as a growing one. It's the upper class who get scared and pull out when things get scary because they have other fall back investments they can fall back on. It's the poor that have nothing else and will hold onto their nest egg for dear life. So you want stability, then your stability will come when someone puts the message to the poor on how they can get in without financially ruining themselves, while growing themselves their own credit replacement in less than 5 years. It's only a matter of time now till someone does what I'm doing with the ghettos I grew up in on a mass scale.

At some point u got to realize what's happening can't be stopped,  the faster you realize that,  ther earlier u hop on before it's to late. Follow the chart. The patterns repeat themselves to a point for a reason, not coincidence. I mean winklevoss twins have a billion they haven't touched.  Yet your scared of losing a couple grand to a near impossible death. If they know enough to hodl onto that much, and Goldman &amp; saqs, Nasdaq, the largest German exchange, large UK exchanges; all making their own custody exchange services, Japan making it a national currency, India, Korea, China opening back up to it, if your blind enough to not see what these giants see, then I guess you don't deserve to be on this ship. At this point, you wouldn't even buy Microsoft after seeing it in every exchange, you wouldn't buy Samsung seeing it in everyone's hand, you wouldn't buy uber or Lyft even though you take one every day.

That's because they priorly already had stock market investments. I had none until my bitcoin soared to a point where 20% of my hodlings could get me a giant chunk of stock. I only entertained the .00001 percent chance of bitcoin death for your minds sake. But yeah, well see who's projections make out correctly in 20 years, your death projection, or my projected continued market growth as it's still early in crypto's life in comparison to where it will be when mass adoption happens like it has happened for many other internet giants. I find it hilarious every-time I come accross one of you guys, always mad that you missed the last couple growths so you wish it to die so you don't feel like an idiot for hoping on while it was still in it's infancy. Yeah, just stay out of the market, a place like this is not for you. i don't even know why you hang out in this sub if you wish it dead, guess you must be one of the endless trolls here trying to spread fud in hopes your comments can kill the market and prove the tiny voice in your head that told you to stay away correct. &amp; My investment teacher made his money betting while the market was at it's bottum, plenty of places to make those kind of returns during a market crash. You should see the kind of returns the monopolies make during the market crashes,what he made is pennies compared to their returns. But whatever, don't listen to anyone, you do you, I'm sure you'll do well that way living a very mediocre life.

What would you like to know? Most questions I get with this are how do they buy it. So I give them a list of trusted exchanges they can use; if they enquire further I tell them about my experience with it and what its projecting. No time frame, just projections about how big it will be if it gets so much behind it. I use examples of other companies and how much they have behind them and what would happen if that was devided behind bitcoins 21 million coins, topping that off with the fact that the whole world can put their currency behind it instead of the limited markets with such high entry barriers like a companies stock investing has.  Finally I end it with the fact that they can buy practically anything with it right now(a house, car, computer, meal, ect), and the likelyhood that in 10 years they'll see it as a payment option at almost any place that takes a credit card and more.

Hard to say, if an ETF gets approved I can easily see a return to the ath of 19k &amp; possibly more, but if they're rejected then another dip to 5k and possibly lower though I doubt it. But again, just another buying opportunity for a speck on the chart that will be but invisible in 20 years.

It will be the top of this and every other crypto related subreddit. As well as  on the front page of every major financial news outlet if an ETF gets approved. Just like it was every-time 1 got rejected.
Also, an ETF is basically an exchange being given approval to enter the stock market and have their own stock listed for traditional investors.

 yes, private keys give you access to your hard wallet be it a phone, hard drive, or flash card. Make sure you store it/them somewhere safe.
@_date: 2018-08-07 06:51:15
Complete market death is almost impossible right now, it's a decentralized network so they would almost have to cut all the power in the world to kill it. The growth and acceptance is also on an exponential growth pattern, it would take a mass hypnotizing the world to forget about it now in order to kill financial interest in it.
I've found to trust the top rate exchanges, or if you want to be really secure then you can store it on a hard wallet, but make sure you never lose your private keys, or expose them to anyone. Personally I'd suggest to hold amounts in several exchanges and hard wallets. That way you have back ups if something ever happens. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:21:10
Good luck trying to get my crypto that way. I'd gladly hand over my fiat currency. Though access to my crypto even I don't know how to without going to some safety deposited boxes at several banks to peice together the keys. And if they try my house, smile for the 4k infared cameras while you set off my alarm, my 2 pits, and 3 British mastiffs. And you better hope my coworker officers from the station down the street pull up first before I come out with my choice of weapon to assist my dogs.

That's why all of us here chose the dollar right? That's why we have built it to the size it is because we chose the dollar instead of bitcoin. People will always choose the thing that grows. It's why were here, the rest of the world will realize it soon. Sure they'll be mad for at it for a year or 2, but when they see what they had 10x, they will see how useless the dollar is like many of us here have. It's why we stay, it's why we sell our dollars. Selling the dying money that will be worth less the longer we hodl it, for the one that grows. All rich people who had an oppertunity to invest in the stock market know this after experience. When the poor get the same chance they will to. I'm living proof, grew up poor, in the ghetto, taught that only the lottery was my way out. Once I got experience with this I woke up from the poor mans illusion. Just like many of my buddies here. Everyone I've introduced chooses crypto, even with the mass drops.

Yet, I'm still here living a way better life putting all my income in it and using it everywhere it's accepted. Adoption is a slow process, but the fact that everyone is here proves that it's happening. Anyone who holds on for more than 2 years realize it. Those who hop out on their first try because of a dip will just have to put up with adopting it late and living in the bottom of the totem pol instead of being an early adopter. The rich are already seeing this and getting in early, as usual, it will be the poor who suffer when they wait so long that it's forced on them when it's already to late. You don't wan't to get in when it stabilizes. Then you'll be the dreaming shmuck that everyone thinks the people getting in are today, the deaming shmucks they thought we were when we got in at 1000 in 2013, same dreaming shmucks they though when we got in at 100, the same dreaming smuchs when we got in at 10, the same dreaming shmucks when we got in at 1 dollar. It's always the trend seers who will prosper, those who live blindly to ignore the trends will be hit by their wave and left behind it when it passes them. The trend is your friend, you can either listen to the trend, or avoid it like you do a friend warning you about a bad decision just to complain to yourself later asking why nobody warned you.

Yup, I just have to asked my friends. All have some crypt, if any of us do have stock, its 1 free share we got on robinhood for referral sign up. If they want me to get into their stock game, then they better trigger the inevitable stock market crash. When it bottoms, then I'll buy. For now, stock is at an ath, waiting to crash. So buying now would be like buying bitcoin at 20k, which I'd still rather buy bitcoin at 20k than getting any stock right now.
@_date: 2018-08-07 06:33:44
I'd say yes, if an etf gets approved then we will have seen the floor. But if they get denied then expect a 5k bitcoin maybe lower though I doubt it. If worst comes to worst maybe a 3kish bitcoin. I'd be happy because i get more of my goals for much cheaper. Though I'm still buying right now with no intents to sell. Even if it dips more my gameplan is to continue buying through this down market. It's the ath that i fear and withhold on moving on. 
Tl;dr now is best time to buy, even if it dips lower it's just a better opportunity. This is how you buy low. Then wait out the market, and hodl during the next ath till the next market crash. Rinse wash repeat.

are those the alt coin markets? If so yes. If it's the stock market, also yes but not nearly as big as my crypto plays. Waiting for the next stock market crash before I make big moves there. For now the down market we are in for crypto is my main goal for priority in hedging my bets. When crypto is high and the stock market is low, then I'll switch attention there and further diversify my portfolio.
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:11:57
The reason they say it will stabilize is because the bigger it gets; the harder it becomes for any group to manipulate it's price with how big the pool becomes, and they're right. But that amount of cash flow to stabilize it won't happen anytime soon. Expect that when we're retiring. For now the chart shows this pattern to continue until at least everyone has a crypto wallet and their savings in it. And I'm okay with that, it's growing faster than I can spend it even with the 80% dips.

The same way it got here. 50 percent of my shops in my town already take crypto, and it's because people asked them too. Adoption is already happening. Slowly but surely this will continue as it is today, and once everyone allows you to use it, those who already have huge amounts will. We live by buy and replace. Your sizable crypto amount will be so much that you won't need a credit card as it is for many of us today. The only reason we replace what we use is so in the future we don't end up overpaying for something when the price goes up. Imagine, a 2 to 5 year nest egg replacing everyone's need of a credit card, and now their incentive to pay it back is their future. Many in this world would do this over credit. It's why we're here, to create new options away from corrupt banking options like credit/loan companies that prey on the undeducated and enslave them financially.

That is supply and demand after all lol, the money behind the market devided by the number of assets. Valuing any other way would be nonsensical. Because the future is never concrete, so valuing on unsolidified projections is betting on an uncertain future. It's also overpaying on ungauranteed gains if someone were to price a coin based on projections, and that's how you get dangerous bubbles that can severely drop a market to unhealthy levels when the bubble pops, derailing projections and market confidence all together. As long as a market sticks to current market structure for its pricing, then confidence and future projections have higher chances of being realized. For example, last year when we were at this price of 6k, Nigeria was trading around 13k a bitcoin, these factors assisted in the bubble we had getting so big and dropping so hard, all be it, the ad bans were the biggest culprits in popping the bubble, but those overvaluing it allowed it to get so high that those unprepared/uneducated in the market made horrific losses when buying and selling at the wrong time.

Just like credit and debit cards when they started trying to become a venue for exchange of value.

Analyst here. Speaking purely out of market structer and pattern. 
Now is the perfect time to do a deal. Last year what killed the market was facebook's ad ban, followed by google's ad ban. Facebook reallowed crypto ads this summer, and google just reallowed them just this month. We have seen the floor, and will be on a steady climb back up to the last all time high, then fomo, new high, slight drop probably back down to a 12k-20k range, then crazy ride to a 50k-100k range by this time next year. If you take the deal, and hodl what your comfortable holding, then you wont see your investment touch 6k a coin again. I got in at a similar time when btc was at 700 recovering from a drop down to 200 from 1300. If I were you, I'd do everything to convince my client to take the deal, and hold at least 75% to 95% of the amount as a nice retirement/business fund. Because where we're going by the next halving of 2020, it will creat a huge supply and demand growth up to 2021, you'll have easily 10×'d your money from where we are today. If you need help selling them on the deal I'd be happy to explain my supply and demand charts designed around the halving with them. Got a great chart, and past example correlation I use to sell my clients on taking btc offers all the time as payments for their investments that they are liquidating.
If it was a bad time to move, I'd tell you. Had all my clients hold off from the 20k range strictly till we hit an 80% drop into a 3k to 5k range. Only trigger that would cancel those restrictions was an ad ban lift, and we have it. Currently having my clients stock up on it now until were back past 15k, then I'm advising them to hodl and wait for the next fomo rise and drop till they make their next move/s.

I always tell my buddies to get enough bitcoin to feel comfortable first, then focus on some alts.

Supply and demand from the flow of money coming in just now, factored by the coins left for our current release going into the next halving, that would easily lead to a 10× in price. In all honesty, when the next halving hits, a 10× price jump is the worst case scenario of a slow growth in the market. Considering all the institutional money starting to come in, and those getting ready/thinking about moving in(Bakkt, Goldman Sachs, Nasdaq, ect), my projections based on those things going through would make the returns astronaumically higher. But as those things aren't concrete yet, then I can only responsibly give a 10× projection on the current market structure, at least until/if those other factors solidify.
