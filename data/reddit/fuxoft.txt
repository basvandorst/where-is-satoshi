Thank you but that sort of defeats the point of having everything backed up using just one 12 word key phrase...
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:57:35
OK, let's simplify that very very much: Let's say you have the private key which is: 1234567890. You calculate the address from that key by taking every second digit. So the corresponding address: is 24680. Well, now you cannot calculate 1234567890 from 24680. You'd have to try all the possible combinations of ?2?4?6?8?0. This is KIND OF how it works with private keys and addresses, only it's much more complex with much more digits and "trying all possible combinations" would take billions of billions of years.

The actual sending from one standard BTC address to another does not physically happen until the channel is closed and transaction added to blockchain. Before you do that, all BTC transactions are only or LN (which might last for many months or years).

There is no need for "every bcash supporter" doing it. One of them can handle them job just fine, it's all automated. Most txs in mempool are there just to make problems for BTC. Look at  - There is a constant influx of new 1-2 sat/b txs.
The nodes can set rules which txs they accept and which they reject. Each node can have its rules. Most nodes are now flat out rejecting zero fee TXs, so it's no longer possible to send BTC for free (which was possible before). Nothing prevents the node owner to reject e.g. all txs with less than 100s/byte fee.

You are right. But even if the tries were unlimited and you could try e.g. 1000 passwords every second, my original statement is true. The odds of finding someone's wallet by chance or brute force are so astronomically small that you shouldn't be concerned about that possibility at all (provided the random number generator that generated the wallet was truly random).
Each wallet's private key is derived from 256 bit random number. That corresponds approximately to purely random 40 characters long password mixing upper and lower case letters, numbers and some special characters.

OK. As I mentioned above, is using the wrong command to calculate the checksum. He calculates the checksum of the STRING "6b86b2...", not of hex number.
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:00:58


In binary numbers, the last digit corresponds to 1, the digit before it to 2, the digit before it to 4, then 8, 16, 32, etc... So in 11-bit binary number, the first digit corresponds to 1024. So 01101011100 in binary corresponds to (from the last digit) 4 + 8 + 16 + 64 + 256 + 512 = 860. That's your word number (in the list of words numbered from 0 to 2047).
Otherwise, your process is correct, except that *you are making an error with the echo | openssl command* (and getting the wrong sha256 checksum). If you write it like you do, you get a checksum of the STRING starting with "6b86b2...", not of a HEX NUMBER! I am not sure how to get the sha256 checksum of hex number using a command line. You can probably do it but I am not sure how. For example, the sha256 checksum of the hex string "616263" (which is equal to text string "abc") should be this: ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad
@_date: 2018-05-13 20:39:43
The last word is not a "checksum word". For 12 words, only the last 4 bits of the last word are the checksum (128 bits of random entropy plus 4 bits of checksum). For 24 words, only the last 8 bits of the last word are the checksum (256 bit of random entropy plus 8 bits of checksum).

1) Yes. 2) No idea.
@_date: 2018-05-13 20:36:56
OK, I'll try:
Let's work only in bits (ones and zeroes). You have to understand how to convert from binary to other bases.
If you want 12 words, generate 128 random bits. If you want 24 words, generate 256 random bits. This is your Master Key (MK).
Use sha256 to generate 256 bit long checksum of MK. This is CHKSUM. (Note that it's not  trivial to use "openssl dgst" to translate a checksum of a BINARY number. You have to convert it to a more suitable representation or use some kind of script. If you use "openssl dgst -sha256 10010100110101001...", your result will be WRONG.)
if your MK has 128 bits, add first 4 bits of CHKSUM at the end of MK. If MK has 256 bits, add first 8 bits of CHKSUM at the end of MK. So your MK is now either 132 or 264 bits long. Note that you only use the first few bits of CHKSUM, the rest of CHKSUM is completely ignored!
Split your MK into groups of 11 bits (which you can do perfectly because both 132 and 264 are divisible by 11). If your MK is 132 bits, you get 12 groups. If your MK is 264 bits, you get 24 groups (do you see the pattern here?).
Replace each of these 11-bit groups by the corresponding word from the list of 2048 words. E.g. 00000000000 = "abandon", 00000000001 = "ability", 00000000010 = "able"... up to 11111111111 = "zone".
Bingo, you have your list of  12 or 24 words.
If you do it like you suggested, e.g. randomly choosing 23 or 11 words and then trying to manually calculate the last one, it's actually much harder than what I described above (because you still have to translate all those words to binary numbers). It's much easier to work in binary the whole time and only convert the groups of 11 bits to words in the last step.
Here is my Lua script which calculates BIP39 codes manually at line 2657:

Because there definitely are people (and no one know how many of them) who speculate that the ETF gets approved and the price will go up - and they already adjusted their trading accordingly. If the ETF does NOT get approved, Bitcoin will have "less value than originally thought" for these people and the price will be adjusted down. In reality, the price development depends on "how many traders currently think the ETF will get approved" vs. "how many traders currently think the ETF won't get approved".

What my script does to keep my important passwords safe (simplified description):
1) I have my MasterPassword, which is rather long and must be kept secret.
2) This passwod (with salt) is hashed using an algorithm that takes time (several seconds), which generates 256 bit MasterKey. You never see the MasterKey, it's never displayed or stored anywhere. It exists only during the script execution, in the computer's memory.
3) After the MasterKey is generated, you enter an "index", for example "BTCColdWallet1". This index is combined with MasterKey and hashed to produce 256 bit key for my first BTC Cold Wallet. This 256 bit key can then be translated to Bitcoin Private Key, alphanumeric password, BIP39 word sequence, whatever. Using the same method, I can have any number of "indexes", for example "BankPassword", "EmailPassword", "FacebookPassword", "MyceliumSeed" etc...
4) The beauty of this solution is that the script itself, all "indexes", and even the salt don't have to be private. I can print them out and put them on my wall, I can have them saved in my Google Keep or Google Drive. The only thing that needs to remain secret is my master password.
The script runs on a Linux laptop which is not connected to the Internet. I use this method for really important passwords. It's not suitable e.g. for using away from your home.

Most of my Bitcoins are in cold storage address whose private key is not stored anywhere - it's generated when I need it (so far only once, when I created the address) using hashing from my top secret master password and salt, using [my own command line script]( single file independent on any external libraries. I believe this to be safer than using the hardware wallet, but this is for longer, more complex discussion.

@_date: 2017-11-17 21:26:28
The address is derived from the private key (and not vice versa). Finding a private key that translates to an address like this has such a low probability that it's de facto impossible. Let me say it in another way: If there was a way to find a private key that translates to this address, the whole Bitcoin ecosystem could not exist because its security would not work at all.

1) If the cryptocurrency users (hodlers, miners, rich Saudi princes, Russian Mafia, naive plebs) think that competing currencies are more advantageous, Bitcoin will lose ground to them. And vice versa. That's as it should be. I don't think the competing currencies are more advantageous and I will stick with Bitcoin. Maybe I will change my mind later. Maybe the users of competing currencies will change their mind later. Say, in 2 days, when the BCH mining difficulty changes radically. Or not. Anyway, I am glad the Core team is not concerned with this.
2) The Core team is working on some solutions but they will have to be something radical (like off-chain transactions) and tested very carefully before deployment. You might think that increasing the blocksize or lowering the difficulty to mine blocks more often might be the solution. You have the right to think so. I don't think so and I am glad the Core team does not think so. If you are looking for short-term solution of this "problem", you have alternatives.

Your math is wrong. If BTC mining profit is 215% of BCH mining profit, then mining BTC is 115% more profitable than mining BCH, not 215% more profitable. The maximum value in the last couple of days was around BTC = 2.4 x BCH, which means "BTC profit was 240% of BCH profit", which means "BTC was 140% more profitable than BCH."

Yes, I am talking about Blockchain.org online wallet. Each time your wallet changes, you can automatically receive its (encrypted) copy thru email. Also, you can back it up to other service using single click. This can be turned off and maybe you never had it enabled (I don't know if it defaults to ON on newer account) but this is extremely helpful feature and it is the reason I stay with blockchain.info: If something tragic suddenly happens to them, I know my BTC are safe.

The same thing happened to me - I sold BTC to someone, later I discovered that the fiat in my account came not from BTC buyer but from some poor soul who thought he was buying medicine. Poor soul wanted all his money back. I went to court and "sort of won" because there is a new law in our country (Czech Republic) since 2014: "If I enrich myself unfairly (which certainly happened) and I acted in good faith (which I did), I have to return only what REMAINS of the amount I enriched myself by." So the court ordered me to return just the difference between my BTC selling rate and the "official" BTC rate at that time (i.e. my margin). Plus we both had to pay our lawyers (which was much bigger blow to the poor guy than to me).
It was even in the news as "First Bitcoin case in our country"

It very much depends on the law in your country. Consider for example this: In my country, it seems BTC is NOT money and has no official value. That means, if I officially "sell BTC for fiat" (as you and me would put it), I have to tax the 100% of incoming fiat and I cannot put the BTC I sold as a "expenses" into my tax return (because BTC has no official value). Also, I cannot operate a "currency exchange" because BTC is not a currency.
Example: Let's say the average BTC exchange rate is 1000 USD for 1 BTC. I sell 1 BTC for 1100 USD and then I have to pay 20% income tax from the 1100 USD I got. 
End result: Unless my premium is at least 25%, I lose money.
The funny thing is that no one (even lawyers and courts) has precise idea if this really works like this and how risky it is to try it.
I do exactly what you propose ( and I already had my account frozen and have been to court twice (one of the articles about my case in Czech:  
So far everything is "OK" for me but it's a legal minefield and I need to have a good lawyer.
