Honestly, who cares about Wikipedia. They beg and beg for money and don't want to accept Bitcoins? Screw um.

Great to hear! I've made 3 small deposits, like ~ 1 BTC and then sold 2 times. So compared to you it sounds like I'm good.
Was just getting a little worried, thanks for easing my mind.

Speculations are speculations but some say it can reach $100,000 eventually. If it ever equates to what a unit of gold is worth can be $300,000.
Time will tell!

Not an article writer but a web designer here. If you guys need some help in that department let me know. Not liking your site too much, the top ad is pushing your entire site down like 200-300 pixels and your navigation is like in the middle of my monitor. 
Your footer is also massive, x5 the size it should be hehe.
I like the idea though, good luck regardless!

I don't have my identity verified yet, but I've cashed out twice and it took 3-5 days. I believe it's faster / instant when your verified.
For instance: I cashed out on Friday and receiving funds on Wednesday.

I've already invested, but my plan is to wait for this weekend and see if it dips to $800 again. If so, I'm going buy a 1/3 or 1/2 a coin.
