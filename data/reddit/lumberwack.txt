It's foolish to sell tomorrow at 40x, if today you can sell at 20x, rebuy at half the price, THEN sell at 40x. Now, if you have absolutely no clue when it comes to analyzing the market.. ok, just hold. But I've made sooo much more buying and selling at the right time than just holding.

Until we reach v.1.0, all versions are beta.

If bitcoin continues to grow, we should hopefully see more competing miners.. making it impossible for anyone to get even close to 51%. The fact that Ghash can get close today just points to how young this technology still is, and how small the network is from a global standpoint. For bitcoin to succeed, the network must grow much, much larger and encompass many more big players. And I think that's what will naturally happen if adoption grows; more miners competing for the same cake.

I never say "search for it" anymore.. I say "google it". So google has become synonymous with doing an online search. That doesn't make it generic though, just extremely popular.

Kraken is good as long as you don't deal with large volumes. They just don't have the customer base for that yet. But for smaller purchases they're one of the best IMO.

There is a lot more off-chain transactions now than before though. If I buy something from a store through coinbase.. it won't count towards the volume. The exchange trade volume is down yes. That doesn't mean the off-chain retail trades are down.

Dogecoin was intentionally made to be a joke. People liked the joke. They started "telling" the joke to people, who also liked it. It's a meme/joke as much as it is a crypto. People bond around things like that.. they don't deserve to be ridiculed because they like to have fun. People in general like to have fun.. make cryptos fun and they will come. Make it hard and boring and they won't.

Register on cryptsy and diversify into LTC maybe? Gamble with it.. I like bit777 and Primedice. Travelling? Buy your ticket or book a hotel through cheapair.com, simplytravelonline.com, or btctrip.com.

I can't believe it's not fiat?

How about this: I can't promise you that we wont crash. I can promise you that as long as Bitcoin continues to grow: we'll always recover from each crash and eventually go higher. Buy some now, buy som more at the next bottom.

Not only that, online banking would be impossible too.

I can only speak for myself, but thanks to bitcoin's increasing price - I have indeed bought more using it because in my mind it's "cheaper" now than it was before. That is - I need to use less of my total holding to buy something now than just a month ago. A lot less. Something for $200 would've been 1 BTC when I bought it. Now it's just 0.17.. so psychologically it's cheaper.
