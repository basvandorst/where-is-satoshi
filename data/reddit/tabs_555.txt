Don’t try and short the bitcoin market. It’s not predictable. You’re almost guaranteed to lose. I know people who shorted it when it hit 13k because it’s hot up so fast, they lost out on a 25% gain and had to buy back in now.

That’s how your money ends up rotting! Good way to lose a cool mil.

It looks to be dropping pretty quick. If it scares some people into selling we might see a few days in the 3ks. Look for a dip and buy

I wouldn’t invest my student loans in businesses either. Plus, Bitcoin is purely speculative. It has virtually no adoption. 99% of bitcoin users are just buying and holding so they can make money. Until there’s widespread adoption, it’s a bubble and it can crash at any time.

Bitcoin interest returns aren’t guaranteed. Peace of mind is.

Glad to see my post history is relevant to this conversation. 
And sure, if you were investing in regular commodities then yes, if your ROI from your investment is greater than your interest, great. But you shouldn’t hold onto student debts because you want bitcoin to rise. That’s irresponsible.

Because commodities are just that... commodities. They are necessary for society to function. If you’re trying to argue not paying off student debts to invest in an incredibly speculative market like bitcoin is better than paying off your student debts, you’re delusional.

Buy when this 4.7k spike dips down to either the 4.5k or4.4k mark. If you're looking for a long term hold just buy now.

Ahh if only I bought bitcoin back before March. Hindsight bias is too real.

I don’t have enough money in to justify buying one. I know that’s not a popular opinion around here.
