Oh yeah I was just pointing out that the period of time doesnt necessarily make or break when the majority of money was going in and out. Even average cost over time because it would have to be adjusted for volume. These runs get crazy high volume
@_date: 2019-07-03 00:23:41
No we arent. Go ahead and dump money in. So you tomorrow for your cry thread
@_date: 2019-07-02 09:43:35
While maybe not, time is not the only factor here. It was a run that last more than one day where the price is higher than now, and even the current range is much higher than most of bitcoins life.
A more reasonable question would be "do you think the majority of MONEY INVESTED was done so during that time?"
But other factors are the cost of bitcoin at the time and the volume of trading. And I think factoring that in, yes, a lot of money was spent and lost during these runs

No, see you are misunderstanding. Bitcoin being worth less than what it was in USD is a fact.
I said this counter your statement to OP, which was stated as if it was fact, but is an opinion. There is no guarantee that bitcoin and crypto wont become worthless tomorrow, while the current monetary system remains in tact.

You act like it is a sure thing that 10% of the world's wealth is going to be in BTC lol. 
Even if it was, in reality it isnt so clear because most of BTC holding is people trading it like stock. Regardless of the value of bitcoin, they dont actually see its value as currency. They will trade it for USD and then use it

Just a few more! Depending on definition of a few.
Seriously though he is being downvoted because implying here that Bitcoin wont rule the world in 10 years is like going on r/weedstocks and telling them that they arent going to be millionaires in a couple years or that no, they arent going to be able to brag to everyone "see you were wrong weed did make me rich!".
Some are delusional. Others just hivemind to try to drive market
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:01:08
Maybe you need to reread the comment that I was responding to. I did not say it will never go up. I said it is not going up like the poster implied it would. As in, return to heavy bull run in a few days.

You can not stop that. If you dont allow them to use an ATM to do it, they will just do it any other way.
The entire premise of Bitcoin makes it perfect for criminal activity and money laundering. Which is why its used so often for this.
The only way to stop it is to place heavy regulations on bitcoin. Removing the point and premise.

Xrp sounds like something that will succeed. Just like BTC. And the weed stocks. And every other get rich quick scheme. Fact of the matter is, people around here need to keep their reality grounded rather than talking others into giving up their life savings

15k for half of it. The other will depend on trends and market. If it seems like it might actually go past ATH without a major catastrophe Ill probably hold till 25k or 30k and reasses a buy in point
@_date: 2019-06-29 11:40:34
So how do you have a loss? It never went below that
Regardless, if you are worried about losing money Bitcoin isnt for you. Its just as likely to go to 2.5k today as it is to go to 25k. Probably more likely

Learn stock trading. Download TD Ameritrade Think or Swim. You can make a play money account.
If 10 dollars is something you are concerned with, you shouldnt be anywhere near bitcoin. 
Even stocks are too risky if you are that tight on money. If you have enough money that you lose a 10 dollar bill you had lying around and don't notice or care, then you have money to throw into risky investments.
When they say dont invest anything you arent willing to lose when it comes to risky investments, they aren't joking.
No one here (smart people atleast) are dealing with or worried about 10 dollars. If you lose 100 here or there its annoying on premise, but its not more than an annoyance. If losing 100 bucks means you cant afford something you need to pay or puts you in a bad spot, then you shouldnt play with it in the first place.
Your best bet is starting with stocks. Even risky stocks are less risky than bitcoin. And Bitcoin trades 24/7 with no safety net and high volatility. So you are worried about it all the time. It can plummet 95% or more in minutes.

@_date: 2019-06-27 01:47:44
Likely never, unless it drops and never goes back up astronomically. But the way you phrase it makes it sound like you are convinced bitcoin will be worth something still in 10 years, so Im sure that isnt what you meant.
No, you are wrong about timing the market. Because the majority literally cant time the market like that. That goes against the basic principles of trading stock and the same applies here.
In order for you to win at bitcoin, someone else needs to lose. For you to make a massive profit, someone else needs to lose their house or sell and miss out.

Well you were one of the lucky ones. Unemployment was over 10%, worse for those who had less savings due to lower income, and many more took pay cuts or hour reductions.
Not to mention how many people could no longer afford their mortgage simply because the rates went up so much. Of course this is what caused the whole thing but that doesnt apply ti the scenario we are talking about assuming their is no hidden rate hike

You also have hundreds of thousands, if not more, bag holders who will sell off upon breaking even as we go through the 8-18k range. Probably most heavy between 9k and 14k. Gona take time to push through thag kind of sell off.
But OP if the traders you mentioned are selling off, thats a major issue. That means one group of traders can manipulate the entite market and that has hige repurcussions

Either way the point remains that its gambling. The longer term you plan to hold stock the more you can manage risk.
Bitcoin is even riskier. Theres no way to twist it to where its not a form of gambling. You buy something that might make you a lot of money, or lose you a lot of money. It doesn't matter if you are certain its going to take over the world. No one really knows

Of course not. But they see it that way. You need to realize theres people here who really, truly believe bitcoin is going to be worth hundreds of thousands in a couple years, maybe millions, and take over the world currency. They dislike the investors that make up a lot of bitcoins base.
Its very similiar to the people in weed stocks. Many that are invested there, atleast the core on the subreddit, and despite the fact the prices have gone way up and evened out to realistic prices, believe that weed stocks are going to he worth hundreds or thousands and allow them to retire.
The typical stance there is "just hold your stock, buy more, and dont look at it except once every couple of years. Dont sell until you see life changing money".
Theyre all waiting for some underperforming weed companies in a semi small country to put up share prices that turn their 40 dollar average jnto life changing money

The money itself is your share of it. There is nothing to cash out. Your dollar has value because it is backed by the US government and will continue to be. Unless you think the US government is going to fail of course.
Proof is in the pudding as they say. Bitcoin is mostly traded to make more US dollars. It is worth the amount of US dollars someone is willing to pay for it.
It will continue to be. Bitcoin is 90% investors who value it solely for its worth in USD. They have no interest in spending it.
The places you even can spend it sre limited. And those places arent accepting your bitcoin. Theyre just getting cash from somewhere else

Also, youre gona have a really hard time convincing someone that (what sounds like, atleast) "a cool system and some math" is better than gold lol.
How is gold faked exactly? I actually didnt know this. But if it can be faked to avoid any detection, wouldnt it basically be gold at that point?
I have a hard time seeing how bitcoin, at any time in the near future, could function on its own without being backed by currency. And currency that is then backed by gold. It all goes back to gold.
Of course anything can happen. Think fallout with its bottle caps. But for now I dont think so.
 Im sure some here share your views though. They believe it will become the worlds currency soon rather than something to trade

@_date: 2019-05-14 20:00:07
How is it a scam? You dont need to own it if youre merely looking to trade it like many are. Robinhood is fantastic if its available in your state.
You buy in at whatever price and then you sell at whatever price. There is no need to physically be able to use it. Most people dont even have any use for it on the legal side of things

There are many that look down on traders. They think one day the worlds currency will be bitcoin. Like like to use bitcoin for stuff. If you dont need to use it for anything, you really dont need physical posession. Robinhood makes it simple to just buy and sell.
You basically are saying "okay I want the right to x amount of bitcoin at y price to sell at a later date and later price".
Sort of like an options contract type deal on robinhood where you dont actually get any stock, just their worth

Legally, gambling is a game of chance not skill.
But typically gambling is a broader definition.
By what you said, horse racing, blackjack, stuff like that, isnt gambling. But it is. Stocks are a less risky form of gambling. Options contracts are a riskier form of stock trading.
You say investments. But do you consider bitcoin part of that? No one really knows what its going to do. Same as stocks.
Bitcoin is even more volatile than typical stocks.
If theres a decebt chance youre going to lose money and your intention is to make money, it probably falls under gambling.
I know many people in the community around bitcoin are certain it will eventually pay off. Just like people in weed stocks are certain. And bio tech. And so on and so on. But nothing here is certain at all.
Research and due diligence manages risk. It doesnt eliminate it.
If the US banned bitcoin, that would be a major blow. If even more countries ban it, itll probably never reach highs that people expect.
I havent really traded bitcoin but I have followed it since day 1. My biggest regret is not buying in those first few days, long before probably 95% of the people here had ever even heard of it. I was going to buy them as a novelty. But even today, I dont think its going to take over like many people think. Unless of course the world governments fall. Then maybe.
But even then, if currency falls, bitcoin could just go down with it
