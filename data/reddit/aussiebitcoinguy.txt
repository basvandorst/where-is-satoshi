A towering figure in the history of medicine was the physician Hippocrates of Kos (c. 460 – c. 370 BCE), considered the **"father of modern medicine."** The Hippocratic Corpus is a collection of around seventy early medical works from ancient **Greece** strongly associated with Hippocrates and his students.


Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee OM KBE FRS FREng FRSA FBCS (born 8 June 1955),[1] also known as TimBL, is an **English engineer and computer scientist, best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web.**


The current system of education, with its western style and content, was **introduced and founded by the British** during the British Raj, following recommendations by Lord Macaulay, who advocated for the teaching of English in schools and the formation of a class of Anglicized Indian interpreters.
Man, you are literally wrong about everything. Holy fuck. Are you always this delusional and fucking racist?

The majority of mining hash power in the world is in China due to electricity prices, so yes, there IS a large number of Chinese (and others in China) with Bitcoin and other coins.

Chinese Lunar New Year happens at the same time period each year. A lot of Chinese people need cash for their red envelopes. Happens every year.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:38:57
If it pisses you off so much, you are only in it for a quick cash grab. 
If you believe in the tech the price becomes irrelevant.

If the number 1 coin in terms of market cap is a piece of shit what does that mean for others? I hold MULTIPLE coins and BTC is not my main holding. I love blockchain technology and will support the ones I believe in (I mine ETH).


1000% rise in the last year alone is a month or two? Come on now. There is literally no volatility in storing unless user error. I have stored on my ledger with not a single issue for a long time now. You haven't provided a single bit of evidence for your claim.


I don't have a multi million dollar fund, nor do about 90% (my guess) of crypto buying people, so I am not sure the point you are making here. And I would say that being there is now a futures market where investors can literally invest multi millions you are wrong.


Each coin has it's use, I agree with you there. But to say Bitcoin doesn't is plain hypocritical. So ALL coins have a use EXCEPT Bitcoin (highest market cap, highest value, highest adoption)? Come on, logic please.


I agree to disagree with this: 


Haven't downvoted you as I love discussion from any side, without discourse we are animals. I am perfectly fine with people having different opinions.

The entry level cost to mine solo and confirm transactions is above most of the population on the planet, you're talking tens - hundreds of thousands + for a mining operation like that. 


It just gets people paying more and more because as humans we are inherently lazy and impatient. If someone has enough money, they don't care paying an extra $10-20




Data outside the block frees up space in the mempool = more transactions per block/ quicker confirmations. Storage of a node is not related, not even in the slightest.

If you use Bitcoin as the digital currency it is intended to be, then tax is not applied to transactions under $10,000.
If you buy and just hold then cash out, you pay 30% CGT.
BTW, you cannot be taxed, especially CGT, on **buying** bitcoin. All the taxes come when converting back to fiat if you have made a profit and do not use it like digital currency.

Sorry but that does not exist here either. Rental prices are just as inflated, if not worse, than buying.
Our housing market has been in a HUGE bubble for a long time now.
Fun fact - 1 in 10 houses in Australia sit empty as they are bought buy internationally investors (mainly China) to "park" money. The government has begun to try crack down on it but it has forced prices up to levels you cannot imagine compared to wage growth and inflation.

Seems kind of naive and silly to assume that the biggest holders of wealth on the planet haven't even touched any crypto.

Can you provide proof of this?
Every single Australian crpyto business I know of has had growth so fast they cannot keep up, mostly. August 14th Bitcoins market cap over took PayPal. So are you also saying that the market for PayPal is even smaller?


Before crypto, the money banks lent out pretty much always came back to them in one way or another. The rise of crypto has literally seen people move their wealth away from the bank to not come back. People are **NOT** selling their Bitcoin just to give banks their money back lol.

Differs country to country but generally if you buy crypto and keep it crypto, nothing is payable. Here in Aus only single transactions over $10,000 are taxable. I convert $1000 when I need it, no tax, ever.

This can help enough I think - 
Roger Ver, who is a "leader" from the decentralized bcash (which has a CEO) is a convicted felon. He mailed explosives in the mail in the US. Here is the Dept. of Justice documentation - 
Bcash is centralised and run by a couple of people. There was a pump and dump a while ago as well as spam attacks on bitcoin as well as orchestrated attacks trying to sway majority hash power to bcash (trying to kill bitcoin and take over)
Bcash is nothing more than an attempt by some fucking scum people to take control and get rich.

You are completely disregarding the part where I use Bitcoin as a personal asset and make regular purchases and payments with it. As stated in another comment. Your "rules" apply to hodlers not people using Bitcoin as the currency it was designed to be.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:55:53
Depends on the country. In Australia a gift cannot be taxed, similar to paying your church "tax" (gift)
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:06:15
I agree phrasing was off.
If you use Bitcoin as it was designed and intended - as a digital currency then there is no tax for any single transaction under $10,000.
If you buy Bitcoin purely to hold and make a profit then sure you pay CGT. 
I personally don't know anyone (in real life not reddit) that only holds and doesn't use Bitcoin for the digital currency it is, but that's just me.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:59:17
If you are asking other people where to put your money maybe just don't invest? If you want to know why to get into Bitcoin, read the whitepaper and do a little research. Decide for yourself if it is something you believe in. Do **NOT** invest if you are looking for a get rich quick scheme.

I'm glad so, I don't want misinformation. There's so much bullshit flying around at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:31:38
My tax return **from the ATO with all crypto relate stuff declared** FY 2016-17 says that the ATO approve of no tax.
Show me proof of your claim? So far I have seen about 20 different interpretations of the ATO stuff. So tell me, why is **your** interpretation the right one? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:23:57
Depends entirely on coinbase. If they set aside that amount and kept it aside after payment failed then maybe.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:25:48


I also run a full node which is part of my hobby - Crypto.
The misinformation is astounding here. I have personally reported, in my tax returns, my crypto stuff and not once (due to no transactions over $10k) have I ever been taxed. You can believe whatever you like, that's your choice. I'll keep doing the right thing and if I'm charged tax will report about it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:27:48
Say you buy 0.5 Bitcoin over the course of a year. Then you convert a small portion to fiat, say $200. How would you then decipher that you have made profit? ATO would see (maybe) that you have spent thousands on buying Bitcoin, if you used your debit card like most people do, then can't equate a small withdrawal to profit as they are not privy to ever knowing how much you hold.
Also, if you convert to fiat from winning at gambling, it is entirely different and not taxable AT ALL. Most conversions to fiat for me have the optional note of "gambling winnings" which I have had and can prove, don't lie about this one as they can ask to see proof.
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:31:32
So when I pay for things using only Bitcoin does this prove your argument a lie and pure FUD?

Oh really? So considering I have bought with Bitcoin (paid for a full mining rig with Bitcoin) and will continue to do so, it is classed as an investment or speculative asset?
If you bought and never ever bought or paid for anything in Bitcoin or any other crypto then maybe, just maybe, they could apply CGT. But if you have ever bought anything this is not the case.

@_date: 2017-12-31 03:10:18
You only factor in CGT for a single transaction over $10,000. It does not matter whether it is a purchase or converting to fiat. That was told to me directly by the ATO but who knows what they are capable of trying if they wanted to.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:30:27
I took the advice with a grain of salt as a random ATO staff member could be wrong but I have contacted them regarding crypto at least 12 different times as the implications of mining can be severe for me.

Correct, you do exactly that and it does indeed work. ATO defines that capital gains tax is only applicable to **single transactions over $10,000**. Read their release if you don't believe me.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:05:52
Bitcoin value is completely irrelevant. It's how much you are converting to fiat. If I convert a whole Bitcoin, which is over $10,000, I would pay 30% Capital Gains. But why would I not just make 20 separate transactions of $1,000 making it no tax?
Maybe you are trolling, who knows.

I personally called the ATO about alt coins as I mine ETH and have a few others. They told me the same $10,000 limit per transaction applies. If I cash out any amount under $10,000 then there is 0 tax. I have converted to fiat a few times and it has always been fine with no tax. 
This financial year end I also get to claim the depreciation from my mining rig (GPU, HD etc) on my tax return which will be a nice little bit of cash.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:06:02
The inputs validate the bitcoin by showing where they came from. The network can check the inputs and go back to ensure those coins were indeed mined and are valid. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:53:36
Not entirely true. If I got to localbitcoins and meet up, buying some coins for cash. I then store on hardware wallet. How would anyone ever know I have them? The entire point of bitcoin and crypto is to get away from centralized shit that charge you just for owning your own shit. You can look at it either way, there is no "right" answer. But I am not giving the government money for me literally just holding my money in crypto, wont happen, ever.

A few things.
- First, they usually 'convince' you to reinvest your earnings to "earn more" hence not having to payout.
- Most cloud mining places have a number and once they reach that number they disappear (generally, not every time)
- What incentive do they have to sell the hashing power that is accurate or even exists? Have you seen the miners? Can you confirm the hashing power of the ones you rented? Their stated contracted power means nothing
-Why would they not just keep 100% of the mined crypto? I mine myself and would never sell hashing power

So a business supplying everyone with crypto isn't allowed to make a profit? I personally am happy to help a company if they provide a service I use/enjoy.


Except mt.gox was hacked. Whether by an insider or not, it was hacked. An exchange didn't just run away with money. An exchange got shut down not long ago, owned charges with crimes all relates to crypto. Few weeks later it is back up again, they didn't run with everyone's money so....
There are scam artists literally EVERYWHERE in every walk of life. Bitcoin is no different but to blanket the entire thing as a scam is just profoundly dumb and ignorant.

He still has the biggest Bitcoin mine in the world and guess what? Using GPU. But hey, you know it all buddy :)
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:35:51
Isn't it marvelous :)
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:54:03
Again, go read Mt.Gox because you clearly think it is something different than it actually is.
I have cashed out big sums of money from exchanges, different sites, bought products etc. Not 1 time have I ever had a company run with my money, never.
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:48:35
I enjoyed the trolling :)
Hope you find the answers you are looking for.
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:33:35
Still the only way to get the persons identity to is hack an exchange. You **cannot hack bitcoin and get their name**.
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:58:10
I think the people who hodl are mostly the people who come to make money. The people using bitcoin regularly, living off it, paying staff with it etc are what keeps the market going. 
Just imagine if EVERYONE hodl'd. The industry would just die.
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:54:51
You clearly don't know anything. They have been proven to reply on Reddit when people have issues. Take your shit advice and fuck off. I'd love to see your reaction if you ever that much money in limbo.

Let me fix that for you:


@_date: 2017-11-23 01:06:56
Nope, just entered an email.
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:36:10


This does not = "proving the point that mining is not profitable". Are you ok?
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:10:06
Roger Ver who is part of the project is a convicted felon and known liar. Jihad Wu tried to use his mining majority to take Bitcoin. They both failed so majorly yet still try and push it with shady shit. Like the "bitcoin.com" app that defaults to creating a BCH wallet. Noobs would not have a clue with this little difference. 
tl:dr - Some dickheads tried to centralise Bitcoin and failed. They ended up with bcash and are still proclaiming it is the "real bitcoin".

Tether was hacked and a trail led to a hacker. This is not the same as Bitcoin being hacked and/or insecure at all.
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:29:16
This is not true at all.
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:20:05
They will still take hash power away from Bitmain, the main goal here.
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:33:42
Hold some, spend some. Quite easy.

I have never bought a gift card in my life so you are already wrong.

Huge congrats from one aussie bitcoin person to another :)
Check out the news.com.au article from yesterday.
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:05:09
That's actually really sad to hear.
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:44:15
Did you ever do any research before coming here and looking like a moron? It can be spent at fucking Microsoft, Amazon. Houses are being bought with Bitcoin. Cars bought with it.
You are so so wrong it's insane.
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:07:19
You forgot the part how 2 years ago they won them back. At least get the story right.
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:50:39
livingroomofsatoshi.com - I use this site to pay bills, send crypto to bank or credit card (real world applications)
getpaidinbitcoin.com.au - I use this site to get bitcoin from my pay each week (no exchange here)
purse.io - I can spend crypto here and buy anything from amazon
I could literally spit out thousands of places that accept/use bitcoin. You are being purposefully ignorant now.
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:49:49
Here in Australia the government prints money via the Mint so they literally do print the money. Technically Bitcoin doesn't fall under anything, there is nothing similar in existence. Like taxing and outlawing marijuana hindered users? You are so wrong lol. I run my computer and make money so your argument is proved wrong by my first hand knowledge and experience. Any other bullshit you would like to try?
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:54:48


You keep making unfounded statements like this.
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:22:21
And what if the difficulty adjusts 10% every time the price adjusts 5%.
For hobbyists and people wanting to mine in their home - ASICS are NOT the answer. 
Hobby mining alt coins on CPU or GPU sure but people will lose money trying to hobby mine bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:48:47
There is literally a Microsoft support article about how to add Bitcoin to your account and buy products with it. Again, do some reading before spouting lies.
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:55:31
We love our Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:46:05
Coinbase with 13 million users is going to just run away? 
If you truly believe that **every single exchange is going to up and run away** then maybe you are beyond saving.
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:40:09
I guess their entire site is wrong and some guy one reddit is right. I mean you have graphs and shit, they don't, right?
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:19:05
Dollar Cost Average.
Buy at regular intervals regardless of price - you will always come out a winner in the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:26:07
Well, for you maybe, in Australia they wouldn't dare and already have stances on it that are fine. If your government is shit well either way you are screwed.
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:20:38
Yes, IF. Solid input
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:44:52
Shill? Can you please explain how I am a shill, never been called that before.
Your entire thread you refuse to accept anything else other than what you believe. What's the point in asking anything?
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:47:21
Agreed, it is limiting but in the context of quick discussion I personally believe it can be cast that way. We could spend hours going into specifics and probably get thousands of different types.
From my personal experience and observation over the last few years I do see 2 types of people (core values). The ones who found bitcoin, don't know much about it and want to make a profit. The other camp are the ones who learn the technology, read the whitepapers, spend bitcoin to support emerging companies/ico's etc.
I completely agree it is a new way to do finance. My view is that it puts power back in the individuals hand. A bank no longer controls my wealth, I control it. I think it will bring power to the individual rather than the corporation and I'm excited for the future :)
I actually think we agree on more than we disagree so that makes me happy.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:34:23
Bitcoin is large scale, not a hobbyist adventure anymore. ETH and other alt coins are def worth mining casually though. Check whattomine.com and see :)
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:38:35


Heaps valid. How's 3rd grade going shill?
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:37:34
It could, I don't think so though. I think without a market where bitcoin is moving to and from people via transaction/trades/whatever that the price would be stagnant. The fact people are using it more and more to do different things (I think) is what makes the price rise. Supply and demand is obviously the root pushing force here so if everyone hodl'd there would be demand but no supply.
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:31:41
I would rather talk to a brick wall than you, ever again. The mental gymnastics you do is actually amazing.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:35:48
No, again lies. I want you to prove your statement or I'll wipe you off as a constant liar.


Prove this statement.

Well considering nearly every single comment in your history is defending bcash I can see why you take this angle and just completely disregard a felony as irrelevant. Well actually it tells me enough I need to know about his character.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:56:05
Hadn't put a single thing in at that point, literally just an email. I assume it's chromes data/cookies etc but doesn't include the actual bitcoin :(
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:16:02
1. I mine myself. I know the profitability (where I live anyway). If you get free/cheap electricity sure pay $2000 for a miner and see. But that miner is not profitable for months, IF EVER. Being we are talking about hobby miners, they generally don't want to spend 100k+ to set up an instantly profitable operation (somewhat).
2. No - if you actually took the chance to read my words I said bitcoin hobby mining is not profitable but **other cryptos are for GPU AND CPU**. You selectively pick words to try and fit your narrative. 
You can tell people whatever you want but  the fact is that Bitcoin **hobby** mining is not profitable except in the extreme long term. I stand by what I said.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:17:32
The problem I see is that you are going into this assuming all exchanges will cut and run. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:38:57
That isn't even a proper sentence that makes any sense LOL. Thank you though, for proving my point.
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:38:58
Thats a pretty good rate for that volume tbh. The guy selling needs to make a little profit for his time and effort.

You are asking questions that are dumb and not plausible let alone possible. Yeah, overnight, a 137B dollar market is going to disappear so we can only use localbitcoin. By your logic, PayPal too is screwed, they have a smaller marketcap than Bitcoin.

Yep, so much detail. There isn't any useful information in this post. Just seems like someone spreading FUD to me.
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:49:43


Nope, I said **Bitcoin mining as a hobby is not profitable**. You are trying to make out I said something completely different and adding no input other than your angry tirades.
@_date: 2018-03-10 04:29:33
So what you are saying is that crypto being able to use contracts and such to deal with mortgages is clearly not in what you choose to research?
There are PLENTY of ways to lend and invest with crypto. Way to spread pure fucking FUD you cretin.
@_date: 2018-03-10 05:59:20
It's an example of what smart contracts can do which clearly you have never even looked at. Just because you think it's irrelevant doesn't make it so. 
Do I need to link all the ways you can invest or loan crypto or can you use google?
One final point - P2P lending
So yes, the banks are NOT required in the crypto world, whether you want to believe it or not. Just so you are aware - I am talking about lending and finance without the need for banks, which you can't address because you are wrong. Anyone, like you, who thinks we NEED banks to survive are just retarded and shouldn't get into crypto in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-10 15:29:24

Most of it is somewhat ok from a basic stand point. Please edit minors to miners as it's really frustrating.
What you need to know is the politics and communities behind it
First: Roger Ver - Convicted Felon - 
Second: Bitcoin.com is owned by Bcash fanatics and clearly deceives new people about the real Bitcoin
Third: The people behind Bcash have actively tried to deceive people and if you check their sub it is clear to see they **believe** they have the real Bitcoin now (complete lie)
Fourth: Bitcoin and Bcash communities on reddit completely hate each other, like full on war. I' try not to get involved in the war but refuse to accept what Bcashers are doing
