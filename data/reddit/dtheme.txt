It's not even available to most of the USA lol only some states....

Privacy coin + Non USA VPN
Plus non USA virtual credit card.
Keep in mind many non USA exchanges / cards / payment systems are required by law to get this information from you.
Personally the sooner the fiat is transferred into crypto the better if this is the route you want.

Downloaded and up voted.
Nice app. I'd like to see an export import csv type option. If all portfolio apps did this, it would be easier to move to newer ones like yours.

Hmm. Think Korea &amp; China both FUDs had a combination of about a 30% drop.
If the USA bans crypto I'd expect an immediate drop of about 60%. Markets would continue dropping as people freak. Biggest long term impact would be where would all the devs go?
If the USA started raids on devs then the market drops even more.
However if the likes of Europe then announced it is not banning crypto then it would be an interesting shift in economics.
If Europe bans on top of the above then the chances are crypto slinks off to South America and goes underground.... There it will lurk until a political change elsewhere.
With technology the likes of VPNs, privacy currencies, a few other new advances may make it easier to buy / trade with.
How to stop all this? Show governments how much they can make via crypto. Taxes etc.
How to make governments ban it? More ATHs that they cannot control nor understand nor profit from.

Dude, I bought ripple at 12 cents ... today I retire :P 
After I buy Dash in the crash because the wife want to retire too ... sigh

So, with a Ledger Nano S you can only actively store 4-5 crypto apps. To store more, you delete one or more &gt; add a new app &gt; transact etc. Then you can delete the app again &gt; install old app and your crypto is there .... 
Question: given the above and bip39 will you be able to recover all crypto on a Ledger in say 10 years using a legacy device? 
I'm also a little confused on how bip39 stores the exact quantity of the crypto you have as the 21 passphrase is given at the start... not after you add currencies etc? How does it know how much you have?
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:19:28
Still no real answer here. Transferwise needs less than an exchange
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:22:21
Yep, I just tried to make one. They wanted phone numbers, passports, driving licence etc
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:24:21
Signing up to poloniex, they are asking for ID :(
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:58:59
No worries. I guess they are all jumping on the clamp down bandwagon. 
I'm having a look around at some others to see if all the same or if LocalBitcoins is the last in town....
@_date: 2018-08-12 11:54:49
I thought Lightning was already implemented? Maybe I was thinking if litecoin.
Not disputing anything you wrote.
But right now, the system sucks. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 03:01:07
Not at all. See the edit. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 11:18:31
Ha. I'm not politically correct. I just like things to work without tiptoes. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 14:45:59
Bitcoin works, just not as it's meant too.
@_date: 2018-08-12 12:44:15
Why would I make something like that up???
Additionally cost came from coinomi wallet. 
"My fault" for clicking fast and just saying okay.
@_date: 2018-08-12 14:53:47
Yes, I got a confirmation in 10 minutes. Then one thereafter. However it took 6 to confirm and the 6 came at 1.15+-
@_date: 2018-08-12 12:47:32
Yes, absolutely. Paypal sucks.
@_date: 2018-08-13 03:05:03
Ah OK got it. Thank you. I literally just scanned the QR code the site gave me and that was it.
I notice on coinomi wallet there are other options. But the site didn't give them to me. So I just paid. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 12:47:09
Didn't say it was worth nothing. 
Not interested in what other people are doing. 
I simply wanted to pay $7 for a monthly service with bitcoin. Took 1 hour 15 minutes. 
Now its gone through and thankfully worked.
If I'd paid with paypal I'd not have had to wait nor pay a wallet
I've been with BTC since 2009. 
It's now 2018..... And still it's like this. Something ain't right somewhere.
@_date: 2018-08-12 11:06:07
I agree with that. 
However, There's really no value to it nor purpose if you can't spend it easily!
Half the reason nobody in the general public cares about it or wants to use it is because it's a pain.
Meanwhile banks and cards are making cashless transactions a breeze
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:00:54
Not disputing that. 
Point I'm making is for a $7 transaction it took over an hour + the fear it timed out and had to send an email to confirm. 
It's simply not an enjoyable, smooth nor particularly helpful experience. 
At least with a CC or Paypal it's instant or it doesn't work. With BTC you are left hanging. 
If BTC really wants to A) be an alternative or B) want the general public to adopt it then this is surely not the way to go. 
Moreover, when one posts about it one get's trolled ... or treated like a tech noob. Hmmmm. Then come the Shillers saying try LTC or Stellar etc. That may be reddit though ... but, it's all bit OTT for what's meant to be the future ... which was born 10 years ago -+
@_date: 2018-08-12 14:46:41
Don't accuse me of lying. I wouldn't write what I wrote just for trolling or for trolls to plunder.
@_date: 2018-08-12 12:45:01
1 hour and about 15 minutes
@_date: 2018-08-12 14:47:38
No option was given 
@_date: 2018-08-12 11:49:34
Europe is good.
Micropayments PayPal, instant.
Bitcoin 1 hour 5 confirms. Payment gateway times out. Now have to send an email to plead I sent a payment ��
@_date: 2018-08-13 03:03:06
I bought a one month subscription to a download / storage service. There seems to be two fees. A transaction and a wallet.
@_date: 2018-08-12 14:47:06
Oh wipe it up. 
It happened. Just because you don't like it. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 03:05:31
Read the comments. Particularly mine. You'll see. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 10:55:34
Yea yea. It's a freaking asset. It's a currency. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:26:28
Yes, I agree. The concept of crypto is fantastic. 
However the implementation of it in the real world is quite bad. Sure, I can buy LTC or whatever with BTC on an exchange in seconds. But if I want to buy something outside of the cryptoworld I'm faced with delays and uncertainty. 
I'd love it all to work well. But, it's not. And the general public experience this too. 99% of the people in this sub are not what I'd call the general public though. 
I'm talking the person who has some BTC and would like to buy a movie subscription or whatever. If they have to go what I just went through ... 
Anyway, my point is made. The trolls above are rapid so I'm going to sign off. Have a good one!
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:35:53
No. I genuinely thought BTC was on Lightening hence I just gave it shot again. Maybe I was reading about LTC again.
I've bought with LTC in the past and it was relatively fast. 
On this occasion I literally saw the option to buy $7. Had my phone next to me and said, why not. 
@_date: 2019-11-27 12:40:57
I'd love to ... just as soon as Bitcoin goes up 31%
@_date: 2018-06-08 00:52:57
2 weeks ago Earn.com stopped all unverified users from withdrawing bitcoin. 
They gave notice they'd start this. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 08:29:39
Your "retarded" comment is not a "kind of joke". It is extremely offensive. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 04:04:25


None. The address just shows "No transactions detected"
@_date: 2018-03-02 04:16:01
Did that. They sent this  Can't make head nor tail on it. I sent over 1 hour ago now.
@_date: 2018-03-03 00:29:49
Thank you for the explanation.
Yes, it does seem to be an Earn issue. They sent no transaction number. No historical record and are  not replying to requests for information. 24 hours later and still nadda.
They so do not give an option to set the fee nor see any dats. It was   .84 cents fee. 
I've edited the original post. Thanks again for helping. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 05:00:58
Can you figure this out  hour 2
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:52:43
Biggest worry for some people is their ALTS disappearing altogether. Especially the more pumped ones like TRON. Or the later ones who were hoping to get funded by fancy websites with swirling logos and universal computing solutions. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 07:58:49
Incredible. You really are this nasty? 
@_date: 2018-03-02 04:31:39
It was a payment from earn.com
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:44:11
Something not adding up. 
No offense. Do some reading mate. Don't listen to others about crypto. Spend a week or so reading about the markets, the type of crypto etc. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 10:54:22
If someone has Bitcoin in cold storage for the past year. How does one move it without getting hammered by old fees? 
Sorry, if it's a noob question but if I do I have to move my "old" bitcoin to a wallet, then back again as a segwit transfer? 
@_date: 2019-01-13 13:20:01
@_date: 2018-03-02 08:35:06
No, it is simply an extremely offensive term. Try thinking outside the box. If you had a relative with mental or physical disabilities. It's a long the same lines as racism and racist terms - just in case you still don't "get it" 
@_date: 2018-03-03 08:23:59
Oh. I hope you did not think it was a bitter sweet reply to you? I genuinely am very grateful for your helpful comments!
Best of all, within minutes, I got the payment! So, somebody is watching ��
I edited the start of the post with the issue! 
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:36:25
There's a strange update on one of their support forums "we no longer support virtual cards". The dashboard is a ghost town. I'd say their gone.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:25:42
Have you spent any time research the crypto market?
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:42:36
The last 3 days have been great. I can actually ask a question in reddit without being shilled or told I'm an idiot for asking.
When it's all green..... 
@_date: 2018-03-02 06:55:39
The insults keep flying. Well done. Thanks for helping someone who is asking a question. Great human being that you are and all. A simple


Something like that is constructive. "Retardation levels" is not. In fact it is a derogatory term. People like you with such terms and comments are one of the reasons I have little hope for humanity. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:29:31




Ok. 


Bye then.
@_date: 2018-03-19 08:05:02
Ha ha ha. Reddit ain't worth it for that.
@_date: 2018-03-02 04:12:13
It was a payout from earn.com. Sent to coinomi. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 05:49:21
Thanks, that was helpful!
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:25:33
16 hours in and ... it's tanking again. I guess you did the right thing! 
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:16:58
The one beginning with S that just stopped Bitcoin payments I'd say.
If ebay stops PayPal payments, I will no longer use it. PayPal sucks, but works. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 04:17:00
Yea, I thought something similar. They sent this  I'm waiting over an hour. It said 30 minutes. Though it's gooblygook to me trying to make sense of it
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:57:07
1) Okay, so everyone gets $400 that lost. What happens to the the additional fiat that the "missing" Bitcoin is now worth? 
2) Secondly, what's stopping them from using all these private keys to obtain Bitcoin Cash and every other fork? Where does all this crypto go? 
3) Lastly, why was there no public announcement about this prior to the dumping of all this coin? Is this not market manipulation at some point?
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:27:14
Good to know, thank you 
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:18:42
And diamond and ... *add all forks
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:18:25
Honestly, what did you expect?
P.S how old are you? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:14:34
Yea, I get it.
But as someone who sells digital products online, I can't tell you how difficult it is to set up without breaking the bank. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:41:19
I believe the "bi" was a typo for "big" lol
