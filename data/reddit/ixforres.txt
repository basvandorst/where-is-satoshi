Fair enough - though sticking a proxy in doesn't actually add that much complexity, especially when the alternative is CloudFlare which is a much more complex thing to manage at the application layer.

A properly configured mod_security module (apache/nginx) or Google's perftools module (apache/nginx) will do a large chunk of what Cloudflare does with none of the fuss, muss or drama - and you keep everything in-house. You then have the ability to debug problems yourself. The DDoS mitigation provided by Cloudflare is fairly weak unless you're on their enterprisey tiers and even then it's not flawless; it doesn't compare to a bespoke DDoS mitigation service, but then at $3k/mo you could be running your own AS, have your own block of PI space, run your own routers etc, with all the DDoS mitigation ability that nets you.

Ah, yes, Windows/IIS kinda sucks for hosting in general when it comes to anything more complex than "Please serve this web page up". You could always stick the Windows boxes behind a security proxy running *nix; I've used that setup in a fair few situations.

;_; why would you do that. I hope you mean rendering. GPU encoder implementations are 99% of the time awful for most codecs.

"anybody who doesn't use cloudflare is insecure!!!"
So, stop using these companies? If that's the best they can muster in terms of security knowledge, look elsewhere...

It is not the correct way to use Cloudflare - you kinda need to use their DNS. One of the many reasons I'd never recommend them or use them. Their 'enterprise' tier lets you CNAME but it is still a deprecated/unrecommended approach, afaik.

Except you just parallelize the whole thing and now you're doing it 50 times a second and it's still cheap.
If you can do it programmatically and get it done before the site says you've taken too long for each process, you can do it as fast as you like.
