I do get it and many of them have failed aside from Bretton Woods.
The US backed out of Bretton Woods in the 70s, I know this. They didn't destroy anything by force, the economics of the Bretton Woods system weren't working so it was eliminated.
No matter what you call it, being eliminated certainly isn't succeeding.
If a rational actor has incentive to back out of a deal they will do it, that seems to be a very real economic issue that arose from gold-backed currency leading to its demise.

You do know what precipitated this, correct?
When DC and NY are rubble from the air raids like London was post-WWII we can consider that option....


Yes, this is very interesting and hard to tell what will happen. Obviously as an open source software anyone can make as many new coins as they want relatively easily but some will actually be useful and will succeed. I don't know which, why or when - but some will succeed.
Forecasting 10 years in bitcoin has to be impossible. Shits been around for 10 and went from $0.00001 to over $20,000.00 back down to $6,000.00. 
I have no idea what's going to happen and I wouldn't even want to make a guess lol - better to remain silent and thought a fool then to open one's mouth and remove all doubt.

Because the "end" isn't two decades away and no one has yet explained to me what will cause this "end" of the USD and US Treasuries in the next 100 years never mind 20.
Well the 10 year and 30 year bonds have a negligible 0.15% spread so you can go by 10 year intervals then. 
You're right, the world won't go under nor will the financial system be destroyed. Everything will look and act exactly like it does now, including USD and UST, with a more efficient twist by the govts/banks for the govts/banks.
Like I said. UST definitely a safer investment than bitcoin in the near term even if you see the "end" coming in 30 years with no warning.

More like patro-yawn. Non factor.


...what about them?


Except for the ones that haven't because they still exist and function as intended.
And by your logic, all precious metal backed currencies have always failed. All commodities backed currencies have always failed. Barter has always failed. 
Since fiat is the only major type of currency in use there might even be an argument that it is the only one to be successful.

Show me.

This is where it gets interesting, I like it.
I'm not sure what interest rate I would lend BTC at. You, the creditor, don't have to fight inflation, which is good. But the debtor has to fight deflation, which is bad.
So the chance that my 50 BTC have the same or better buying power at the end of the loan is good but the chance that the debtor can continue making payments worth more over time is lower which is bad.
So I don't need to price in the risk premium of inflation of bitcoin but I need to price in a greater risk premium of the debtor defaulting. I personally think that individual defaults are a lot harder to predict than long-term inflation so the rate would probably be at least as high as current mortgages in fiat, probably higher.
So let's say 6% from a prime borrower?
What would you lend BTC out as if it was secured by a house?
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:52:49
So then US Treasuries would, in fact, be a safer investment than Bitcoin in the coming "few decades" like I said originally?
If the point of bitcoin comes down to WWIII and the destruction of the global financial system then good luck waiting for it to happen so you can be right. Though, in that case, guns, ammo, food and water seem like they would be more prescient investments.
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:01:57
Yeah, probably. The US Gov't has made every debt payment its ever owed and its bonds are rated and priced as the safest investments in the world.
Being able to print the global reserve currency and having the most powerful military in the world goes a long way to ensuring this system continues in the future.
But yeah I'm sure bitcoin is a safer investment than anything else that has ever existed.

Gold isn't a currency (or a commodity imo but w/e) so the fact that it still has value in no way invalidates the claim that all commodities backed currencies have always failed. You can't exchange any gold-backed currency for gold today - they don't exist because they failed.
I consider gold more as a precious metal than a commodity due to its pricing in comparison to its utility, but that's a discussion for another time.
There are governments have tried to run commodities backed currencies and have not succeeded. 
I will give you that the US backed out of the gold standard because it saw the gold as more valuable - that's true - but I don't think that this one event explains away the fiat vs commodities argument.


And all of the gold backed currencies have failed for one reason or another. And all of the oil backed currencies have failed, etc.
Fiat money is the most widely used and accepted type of money ever to exist in the world and if that isn't "successful" enough then I really don't know what to tell you.
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:58:01
Yes, because the world is inhabited by people who act human and tend to value their own interests over the interests of others, particularly adversaries.
There are numerous examples of countries that used commodity-backed currencies and without fail they eschewed them for fiat. This, to me, looks like an economic/utility function that fiat performs better than commodity-backed.
Different groups of people leading culturally different nations at different times decided that fiat had a better cost/benefit than commodity-backed.
If you are arguing that people have changed and commodity-backed really would work better then fiat, good luck to you.
It appears to me that human nature all over the world has led to fiat because of the benefits compared to commodity-backed. This is what commodity-backed failure looks like.

Well, if we're talking about the US here QE has been over since 2014 so more like we did do QE for 6 years and stopped almost 4 years ago.
And comparing the US of 2018 to Zimbabwe or the Weimer Republic is laughable.
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:51:57
So I'm going to loan someone 50 BTC for a house and then accept 45 BTC back 15 years later?
No. You would just hold your BTC and not loan it at all if you had to pay someone to borrow it.
@_date: 2018-05-13 15:01:56
Yeah this is the tough part. I'm not sure the implications of the tight credit that I think is implied by using a deflationary currency.
If you can make 5% by not loaning or investing your BTC then I see a lot of people just taking that risk free deflation rather than chasing bigger gains. But who knows how it would actually play out on a large scale.
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:04:09


Yes, absolutely. 


I wonder whether the lack of cheap credit for the poor will help or hurt them. When you are living off of a credit card the consequences can be dire if you lose that source of credit.
Obviously a lack of cheap credit will hurt the bottom line of every business out there but what I wonder is whether this helps those who spend modestly and save at the expense of the poor and the larger economy in general.
I don't know what will happen, all I can do is throw out some ideas.  I believe it would be a pain on the economy but it may also be a big boon to the ever-dwindling middle class. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:19:51
Now that is a fair point to begin a discussion with.
I may be foolish in thinking "it will be different this time!" but I do believe the map has shrunk significantly since the last great empire fell. At a certain point, control/influence over the entire globe became feasible and the US stepped up to the plate. 
There is no other entity with as much money, assets, influence and hard power in the world - and I don't see how or why that would change in the next few decades. That being said, you never know.
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:11:53
Because we all know QE ended in 2014.
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:00:18
That is a big issue and I'm not sure if it will ever be remedied.


I think both. Gold did become more valuable as it plays an important role as a conductor in the manufacturing of cell phones, etc. The dollar also did lose some value to inflation over that time period.
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:49:58
I disagree. This is in no way comparable to the government printing another $140B and adding it to the money supply.
Bitcoin has a $140B market cap. No one put $140B into bitcoin, no one can take $140B out of bitcoin, yet that is what its valued at. 
Where did this extra value come from?
People trading with each other is zero sum in the sense that there is a buyer/seller for every transaction but the value placed on that trade can be applied to everyone else's holdings that aren't for trade.
Like it or not, bitcoin did create $140B in wealth on paper that didn't exist before it.
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:05:44
Well yeah.
If you're a billionaire I would consider irresponsible to not invest in any asset class, sector, maybe even company. Like you could hate Coke and think its the worst company ever with no future...but what's the cost of not investing a negligible amount of your money in it if it could have the slightest possibility of success?
If I was a billionaire investor I would literally own some of everything that is publicly traded and then weight assets/sectors/companies based on my feelings for the future. Why not?
If you have a few billion dollars would it really hurt that much to put $500k-$1M in any particular asset? I doubt it.
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:47:11
Cool, I think talking about this stuff is really interesting. Forecasting interest rates for stable cryptocurrency loans isn't something oft mentioned but to me underlies how this technology could change the entire scope of the economy.


The idea of people not taking out loans for consumption is good for them. But the massive consumption of Americans (sometimes on credit) is really what has driven the economy to be so successful.
So while I think that is great for people (now that self-control has been moved to a 3rd party) it will certainly slow the economy by reducing willingness to lend and reducing appetite for consumption.
Interesting times we live in, that's for sure.

My opinion:
Laws are supposed to punish people for things that we have agreed to outlaw. Laws aren't supposed to be enacted to try to make it harder to break other laws.
No one has agreed to the idea that you shouldn't be able to spend cash over $500 or $10000. There is nothing morally wrong with spending $15000 on a car, is there?
Making it a crime to spend larger amounts of cash won't have any effect on criminals who make and spend large amounts of money. They have procedures in place to clean money before they use it, they generally don't take $20k of drug money from the trap house to the nearest luxury store.
My issue is when you enact a policy for a particular reason and say that it will fix a problem and it really doesn't address the problem at all.
Like bump stocks, for example:
Is there any need for them? No.
Should they be legal? Probably not.
Can you make one with household items? Yes.
Will banning decrease the number of mass shooting deaths? No.
I understand the Vegas shooting was scary but I have seen gun-control activists quoted as saying this may be the only crime ever committed with a bump stock.
Then it comes down to:
1) Criminals break laws, so why have laws?
2) This policy will have no effect on the actual issue, why bother enacting it at all?
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:07:47
That's how deflation works. You don't get paid more every year because the money is worth less you get paid less every year because the money is worth more.
I guess you wouldn't have to do fixed payments like we currently do. Instead it could be a frontloaded loan to defray deflation.

Over the course of 100 years I expect wages denominated in bitcoin to go down significantly rather than up. 
So each year the borrower is paying a larger share of their earnings for a property that may or may not be worth it.

It was a clear case of violating the gold standard.
I just don't see how people in power repeatedly refusing to use a type of currency, due to the economic implications, can't be seen as a failure.
So basically when people ruin commodity-backed currencies that isn't a failure at all. Yet, when some of these same people ruin fiat currency that is a clear and indisputable failure of the type of currency.
