20 Years later in 2060 (5 Halvenings Later) that number will be 0.87890 BTC a day. The first year that will mine under 1 Bitcoin per day.
The Yearly perspective if you were interested.
Today: 657,000 Bitcoin mined yearly (Halves in 2020)
2040: 10,265.6 Bitcoin mined yearly
2060: 320.8 Bitcoin mined yearly

Its showing you how much money you would have to spend to get to $10,700 Bitcoin on the right, and how much you would sell to get to the $10,300 Bitcoin at the left.
It becomes less steep because there are less buy/sell order volumes at the outer ranges of the mid price.
Edit: As of this price. Its about 500 Bitcoins of value to the right, and 300 Bitcoins to the left to buy up/down to those levels.

\*Note: The BTC Supply is lying on top of the world population.
867x867 Pixels represents 7.5 Billion (world Population)
Relative, BTC (21,000,000) would be 46x46 Pixels.
So each pixel is valued at 10,000.
This is just super simplified to fit on a 867x867 pixel visualization.
I just divided 7.5 Billion and 21,000,000 by 10,000. Then square rooting those values I got 867 and 46. (46x46 square for the 21,000,000) and 867x867 pixel square for the 7.5 Billion.

You won't convince people to spend without solutions first. Once fee's can be basically non existent or close to zero
and transactions happen in milliseconds of milliseconds, then and only then, will a growing or existing business look at Bitcoin and be like, "Damn, why use fiat currency as a method of payment that fee's me 1-2+% when I can use this?".

I think people are hyped for it way too far in advance. So by time it comes around a lot of people are already zoned out and they sell off or become really bearish.
The people who stayed around however are rewarded since they understand the halving is no joke. Limited supply currency, just became more limited.

Listen here brother.
1. Dollar cost average in what you can afford every week (10-50 dollars)
2. SECURE your bitcoin with a hardware wallet like a Trezor/Ledger (look it up)
3. For every week you buy, watch an informative video/read an article on the subject matter. Douse yourself in the space and LEARN.
4. BE AN ULTIMATE BEAST: Run your own node
5. Never disclose you are invested in this space too heavily, or at all.

So are we kinda in another accumulation phase for a bit before we blast off?
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:19:46
Here is an easy way to look at it.
Every new Bitcoin purchase you make, is an investment for 2-3 years down the road. Never for the short term. ALWAYS long term. Don't try to trade if you are new into the space, you will more or less always lose, and it will just become a gamble.
@_date: 2019-05-20 07:56:44

@_date: 2019-05-19 22:14:18
1. Educate yourself FIRST about the fundamentals rather than be hypnotized by price action and potential "gains". You won't get rich over night, never ever. Prepare to wait over 5+ years before real meaningful applications are built on bitcoin rather than just the most obvious one being money. (Andreas Antonopoulus)
2. Accumulate as much as you can, even its just 1% of your net worth. Once you have accumulated an amount that is a lot to you, learn about security and secure those bad boys up. 
3. Learn as much as you can about securing your coins. NOT YOUR KEYS NOT YOUR COINS. Don't keep your crypto on an exchange. Hardware Wallet/Paperwallet even some desktop wallets are good. (Exodus, Trezor, Ledger). 
4. This market is VOLATILE, if you can't handle a 80%+ dip you came to the wrong place. HODL.
tl;dr 
Educate before you buy (fundamentals/security)
Buy only what you are wiilling to lose 
Expect huge volatility

Hardware Wallets -&gt; Phone apps -&gt; desktop wallets -&gt; Exchanges.
Most secure to least secure. Exchanges shouldn't even be here because technically the Crypto isn't actually yours if its there, but some people store coins there.
