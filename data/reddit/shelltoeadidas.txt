Isn’t latency and saturation completely dependent on traffic? i.e. nobody is using it, so how can we know how fast it is?

LOL. Amazon will never accept cryptocurrencies.

I don’t quite buy that. If usage is low, as it is today, it should be super fast with only a handful of nodes.

The phrase ends with "invention" not "innovation." In this case the necessity is crypto hype, and the invention is a relationship this article has to anything that advances crypto as a currency rather than a speculative market comprised of turkeys.

This news just might put us back on the 18k track.

Short article. “Answer: no.”

I am focusing exclusively on "number of merchants" and or the number of transactions that are for goods and services, rather than any metrics around mining, wallets, or whatever else that are devoted to bitcoin for bitcoin's sake. If you show me any evidence that BTC transactions relate to solving real world problems, call me enlightened. Otherwise, the network effect argument is dead on arrival.

Pardon the pun but I don't buy it. The network effect describes an investment that becomes more valuable as people use it. The original example of this was the Netscape IPO in 1995. Many followed - including Twitter almost 18 years later.
The Bitcoin network effect is not based on usage, but speculation itself. The more people speculating, the higher the price. Bitcoin usage as a currency is laughably rare.
People downloaded Netscape Navigator to browse the world wide web. People use twitter to publish and consume thoughts and ideas. 99% of those that use Bitcoin use it to invest in Bitcoin. Period. 
Imagine an alternate reality - it's 1995 - and the world wide web is not getting any traction at all. People use the yellow pages, libraries, and such, instead. But the NSCP stock takes off anyhow - why? Because everyone is downloading Netscape Navigator - not to browse the world wide web - but to track and trade the stock of the company behind the browser. Now you have an accurate "network effect" speculation analogy. I would accept an example more like that one.

Sure stock markets, housing markets, mercantile exchanges, corporate and government bond markets, all of them involve some level of speculation. Somehow crypto feels just a tad different. You can figure the rest of that argument out yourself.

Digital currency for our post apocalyptic future? That just won’t fly. Thiel should stock up on bullets, gasoline, water, and canned food if he wants to pay off the mercenaries and keep his nap schedule.
