To be fair pretty much anything is illegal in Saudi Arabia
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:48:03
its like calling Linus Torvalds CEO of linux
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:39:31
for your 2nd point, there is some bitcoin ATM that require no verifications what so ever, I guess it depends wich one
@_date: 2014-09-18 15:11:25
allright I just called them, its 5%
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:14:02
Just give it a try dude...
@_date: 2014-09-18 14:56:19


I like the way you see things, converting problems into an idea
@_date: 2014-11-14 15:29:13
see this as a ''like'' on facebook, but with a real value
@_date: 2014-12-04 15:47:29
If I can't deposit fiat from canada the app is still worthless

@_date: 2014-06-12 17:36:32
it happend to me once
@_date: 2014-11-13 23:06:54
Oh so thats why a friend of mine managed to do it
@_date: 2014-09-18 14:53:49
I live in Quebec city and there is one since a few months, I did not tried it yet but I heard the fees are not really good
@_date: 2014-09-18 15:39:21
nope, but Ill try thanks, any canadian here who tried vault of satochi ?
@_date: 2014-09-18 14:22:29
I am canadian and it is the same here.
Currently the best way for us to buy is by Cavirtex, wich is a good service! But its is still a pain in the ass for the average Joe. I have TONS of friends who want to purchase bitcoins but they give up when they see the verifications process, the fees and the average delay between the time their money is transfered from their bank account to cavirtex.
Recently they added an interact method to pay, wich require lower fees and faster money transfer but it is only supported by a few banks.

yeah, I think it was the Mintchip idea (to not confuse with the eve online chick)
I think this project is dead now
@_date: 2014-11-14 15:27:02
I think the main problem was because it wasn't decentralised 
@_date: 2014-11-13 20:23:13
yeah but they still do not accept canadian credit cards so its pointless. I use [coin.mx]( 
@_date: 2015-05-06 13:46:26
There should be a coin machine like that but it pays you imediatly in Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-16 15:43:21
im somewhat disappointed it does not exist
@_date: 2016-03-27 13:38:57
why is it called cord canada if it is made in usa ?
@_date: 2016-03-24 19:32:44
well, it is like I will have to work an entire week to receive 1$ worth of bitcoin
@_date: 2014-10-03 22:10:12
you forgot the junkie who only buy bitcoin to get drugs
@_date: 2016-06-06 03:48:41

@_date: 2016-10-19 19:44:34

@_date: 2016-10-19 16:47:30

@_date: 2015-11-03 16:03:33
Yes, I do now want to make ad for a company but I got a great service from 
for gpu mining look up for their basic gpu mining kit, or they have some cheap oudated asic to mine if you just want to have some happy mining fun

@_date: 2015-11-05 20:07:04
@_date: 2015-11-03 15:50:25
for fun yes! but do not expect to make any much from it, if you want to gpu mine you should try to mine some X11 coins like DASH
@_date: 2015-03-30 23:14:09
well I am not affiliated with agora in any way so I honestly don't see any problem
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:40:32
you pretty much gave all the possibilities, I guess that was the joke
@_date: 2015-11-23 21:09:58
look for antminer, iI used to shop mines at bitcoinware.net, but don't expect to make any money from this...
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:17:31
wait, that really happened for real ? cuz if did it im telling you I am closing my account RIGHT FUCKING NOW 
@_date: 2015-11-30 21:08:03
you should put all the money you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:22:35
uh, I am a mod on perhaps I should panic...
@_date: 2015-02-01 06:03:04
@_date: 2016-05-26 18:43:51
how will a software allow me to insert 20$ fiat inside my phone ?
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:14:44
@_date: 2016-07-21 14:17:20
relax, that will never happen
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:42:49


fuck off
@_date: 2015-11-03 15:12:48
this sub does not really like blockchain.info so you can expect most people will tell you to stay away from it
@_date: 2015-02-26 14:38:59
I allways tought Bitcoin would be a great opportunity for coinstar machines
