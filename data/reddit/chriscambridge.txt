.. He gave someone (based in London, UK) 10,000 Bitcoins..
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:18:54
Post the transaction Id for the transfer (a) to prove you not some troll looking for attention, and (b) so we can see just how little you have actually given him. 
10th of a Bitcoin yeah? $1500.. Anything less than that would be a joke really.

Harsh, but true.
Go to any country on Earth, leave the cities and go out into the villages and non-urban areas. You find dirt roads and poverty. Lack of education and poor health standards.
Goverment are the ony ones who can change this. Giving some guy a small amount of BTC which he can do nothing with does nothting but makes the OP fell good about himself.
In truth he should have given the BTC or Fiat equivalent to a charity that works with the poor in Africa. They are the ones who will help change this guys life, and help the government who is actually meant to be looking after its citizens.
That is if this guy is even African.. He could be Chinese living in a 200 story glass tower block, doing phising attempts via Facebook while he waits for his equities trades to complete. It would be a great way to grab a bit of bitcoin while your waiting, from OPs with limited intelligence.

Tulips are infinite; you can grow more (in other places) to meet demand.
The South Sea business never had any chance of actually doing trade due to the Politics of the time.
Bitcoin on the other hand is finite, and is actually being used in large asset purchases (as the article above shows).

Yes I guess he could exchange into Ether or perhaps Litecoin.
I guess that this is the most important thing in his life now;  and live the dream..
Perhaps the doctor accepts Bitcoin? Perhaps the land owner accepts Bitcoin? Perhaps the local farmer accepts Bitcoin?.. 
Yeah giving him a small amount of BTC has really expanded his options..
@_date: 2018-09-01 00:15:00
The thing is you never invested in Bitcoin. You bought a CFD. A bit of paper that says "I can tell the future and price \[of Bitcoin\] is going to drop".. Unfortunately you were wrong and hence you lost that bet.
The FCA warned about the risks of Crypto CFD's over 6 months ago.


When you pose the question of if companies and individuals 'manipulate', in relation to you losing money, then yes you are clearly trying to blame others.
Because of CFD's, manipulation works both ways, both up and down.
If the market had dropped like you bet, would you now be here blaming others of manipulation? Of course not because then you would have made money; you are only here pointing the finger of blame at others because the opposite happened.


We dont need to, it speaks for itself. If you had invested 100% of your money into actual Bitcoin you would not have lost it all now. Unlike your CFD gamble..

I think your keyboard has a key stuck. Contac OP and tell him you are from India, ping him over a pix, and he will send you some BTC to buy a new one.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:56:07
If you really cared you would have just giving him some Fiat which he could actually use, instead of just being condescending. Hey poor person, this is called bitcoin, $5000 just got wiped off the price, yeah I know that is more than you will probably earn in your whole life, but hey  brother. Think of how many Billions you are going to have in the future.. blah blah..
When you do something really good in life, you don't shout about it from the social media rooftops... And telling a poor person about Bitcoin let alone 'giving' them some, is like giving someone with no arms and pair of leather gloves. Great but absolutely useless..
And,.. if you think 'walking down a dirt road' is bad then perhaps you should go live in the Jungle or Desert for a bit to see the difference.. The last time I checked jungles and deserts did not have roads, shops, let alone internet connections which clearly this guy did have. 
I'd maybe change the password on your wallet seeing you as viewing files he sent you.. "he even sent me pics".. Perhaps he is brute forcing your .dat file right now while you are on Reddit bigging it up. 
I notice you do not say exactly how much Bitcoin you gave him, or give out the transaction ID to prove it.. What a surprise.
@_date: 2018-09-01 02:35:28


It really depends when you got in, and at what price. Even $20K to $7K is not really that bad as most people understand the bull market will return once there are more buyers than sellers (in value). But yeah it could take many years, or just a few months - no one really knows.
But if you compare this to the ROI on most stocks/shares, in the end you will probably still see a better return as BTC is finite unlike shares where more can just be issued.
As I mentioned in another comment, its good to have a mixed investment portfolio. If you google why it is wise to have crypto (bitcoin) along with stocks/shares, then you will understand.
Like you say, just treat your experience of CFDs as a learning lesson.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:19:54
Sorry, how does an small amount of BTC sitting somewhere he cannot access help 'him solve his problems today?

I agree it's a lot of people, but Nigeria has much more wealth (the World's largest Oil reserves, if I not mistaken) than say Spain who actually has a higher number of unemployment (but with only about 1/3 of the size of the population of Nigeria).

How is giving some BTC when they cannot spend it, going to change this guys life? Within a second he would swap it for something useful. They guy should have just sent him $100 if he wanted to do something good.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:16:21
I would hardly call 'a small amount of BTC' large sums of Bitcoin. I notice how he never said how much or showed a transaction Id to prove.

Well done, it's good to see someone do something nice and worthwhile with their 'good luck'.
Have you thought about buying (and holding or even burning) some GridCoin and CureCoin? These are not your usual cryptocoins in both the way they are created but also what is achieved..
Both are issued/created from the data processing done via 2 volunteer computing projects called BOINC and Folding run by Berkeley and Stanford Universities; These projects encompass many sub projects much of which are also run by International Universities.
The projects that data is processed for, and which is how the coins are created and issued, include Academic and private research projects doing work on various Science, Math, Technology, Climate change, Medical, and many other important projects.
Medical projects including those trying to find cures and doing research on: Aids, TB, Zika, Ebola, Alzheimer's, Cancer - as well as general Protein folding.
Other science projects include: tracking Asteroids, Modelling climate change, Encryption, Proving/Disproving Mathematical conjectures, and many others.
    
    
Obviously by purchasing and holding (or burning) CureCoin and GridCoin it will decrease supply and increase demand, thereby rising the price - which in turn will then bring in new generations of those looking to 'mine' these coins, later finding out that rather than producing pointless hashes, instead they are actually processing data for important research projects.
In terms of donations, both BOINC and F as well as most of the sub projects have a way you can donate, including in some cases by cryptocurrency also.
Anyway, either way, again well done for sharing you good fortune to make the World a better place.

I have bought Bitcoin from many online sources, via a Barclays account, with no problems.

Lol you are the one who has been downvoted to invisible for being a Troll.. haha
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:07:47


Lol I am not sure who told you all this, but there are tens of thousands on GPU miners at NiceHash, Honeyminer, etc etc mining the most profitable alt-coin algorithms via GPUs earning BTC - including me.
There are even more people mining ETH via Claymore, as well as other alt-coins, directly - including me.
And in terms of EthLargePill, yes we know about his and use it to mine ETH, as it increases our hashrate to over 50+ MH/s on our 1080 Ti's.
The question of this post, was about NVidia buying and hodling BT in order to rise the price which would then rise alt-coin prices; not about the future of GPU ming and what may or may not happen, about mining specific coins, or NVidia making their GPUs more mining powerful.

So true. The value of Bitcoin is important but not as important as the technology and the things it can solve.
Its absurd that a digital transaction takes days to update your balance within your Bank account.
Its also absurd that it costs so much to move money around the Country/World, be it (billable) BACS/SWIFT, Western Union, or Worldremit.
However things are slowly changing and the Bank industry is starting to wake up (after being kicked from all directions).
[coins.ph]( is basically a "Bank account" with BTC/ETH wallets that allow you to switch between Fiat and Crypto at a click of a Button, which millions of people use and is partnered with actual banks and payment services.
Litecoin just bought into a 9% stake of WEG Bank (Germany) via its partnership with TokenPay.
And of course we have all heard about the partnerships and new services being offered around Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-31 23:49:01
CFD: A contract for future difference. You sell a share (etc) today, and pay for it in the future. EG: short selling.
You really are dumb .. Not only for losing that amount of money, trading in CFD's, but also for letting someone who gets paid if you win or lose, "advise you"..
But I guess the cherry on the cake has to be your assertion/comment:






A CFD is worth nothing so you have not invested in anything, you just speculated on making money due to given events.
And here you are blaming everyone but yourself.. IG, advisers, crypto, bitcoin forks, brokers, government..

Coinify if you're from Europe, or VirWox I believe is Worldwide.

Lol it wasn't a serious business plan for NVidia. More a comment on the fact that they just issued a profit warning due to the down turn of the alt-crypto industry, and lack of miners buying their GPUs.

if you are buying less than €1000 and you don't want to upload 'ID theft' info, then try:
All you have to do is use a EU registered debit/credit card (Visa etc) and provide a valid EU mobile number, for ID verification.
Both sites are legit EU companies, which I can personally recommend as they work well.
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:27:34
You can buy Bitcoin via VirWox without any KYC/AML requirements, however the fees are larger than Coinify.
Basically you buy SLL with your debit/credit card and then exchange into Bitcoin at VirWox. You can then send your BTC to an external wallet.
@_date: 2018-08-12 12:47:38
Bitcoin and Ethereum already works in a Banking setting. It is called [ and millions of people already use it. You can use your account like a Bank account, to pay money in and pay bills, but it also has ETH and BTC wallets, that you can convert to and from local currency, at a click of a button.
@_date: 2018-08-12 12:59:56
Perhaps instead you should actually do some research.
The follow Banks/payment services are partnered with coins.php: Union Bank, Bank of Commerce, Touch Pay.
Do you honestly think these Banks dont transact with Western Banks and payment services? If so, you obviously dont understand banks and what they do.
But that is fine we can ignore your non-G7 racism for now..
You might be somewhat surprised to find out that LiteCoin just partnered with TokenPay, and TokenPay own a 9% stake of WEG Bank (Germany).
In addition to this their have been many other partnerships and services launched in just area. 
Perhaps it would be better to actually research the current trends rather than just try to bash Bitcoin and other cryptos.

coins.php is not a trading platform, its more a bank account/bill paying service, which also allows you to convert between Peso and BTC.
The problem here, as already stated, is nothing to do with [coins.ph]( but its about internet security and not getting phished. E.G to turn on and use 2FA.
@_date: 2018-08-12 07:59:33
If you want to buy smaller amounts of BTC (£300 or less) quickly, cheaply, and without having to upload ID theft info, [coinify.com]( works well.
I have been using this site for over a year now with no problems. You can also sell your BTC here too (if required).

SCAN is one of the most comprehensive places to buy Computer, Tech, Gaming, Music Production, Video, and other Electronics stuff with Bitcoin; its based in UK but ships across Europe (and possible Worldwide?) and offers next day delivery.
Its been given a few Awards for service, including from The Sunday Times and WHICH.

When you spend Bitcoin, what do you think the retailers do with the BTC? Most convert it straight into Fiat. And what does that do to the price? And how does the price effect the number of new people buying Bitcoin?
Sure spending Bitcoin is very useful as it shows Bitcoin is truly a currency. But hodling has the greatest effect (for the long term) as that stabilizes the BTC price and allows it to increase (as more people buy in), like all good 'store's of wealth'.
Bitcoin is Great because it is not only a currency that can be spent, but also an asset that can be invested into. Both Gold and $/£/€  can't do this, proving that Bitcoin is truly unique.

"Bitcoin is barely accepted anywhere."
If you really believe this, then there is little point trying to educate you.
And just to be clear, this article is actually nothing to do with Bitcoin, it's actually the ECB trying to shift focus from the EU's real problems such as Italian politics, economic migrants, the Greek and Irish etc debt problems, and Brexit perhaps being a first of many exoduses from the EU.

The Bank of England are already researching Digital currencies. The Royal Mint have already launched a digital currency backed by Gold.
I would be pretty surprised if the Federal Reserve and ECB etc have not already also started this research also.
So are you saying you know more than some of the Oldest Banks and Mint's in the World?
It should be fairly obvious that digital currencies have massive positive implications for speed and cost, as already stated by CrypticallyDodge.


Diamonds have worth because DeBeers went around the world buying up the diamond mines and beaches, and then persuaded people they were special and should be bought for Wedding rings and Jewelry. Apart from drilling tips, Diamonds have little worth in themself.
Yet again, it should be fairly obvious that currencies only have value when people and the markets believe in them. Take Turkey, a member of NATO, who currency right now is crashing makes this point nicely.


The Bitcoin 'specification' never had requirements for reverse transactions, so to try and bash Bitcoin on this is absurd.
Do you honestly think with off-chain transactions etc, technologies or new wallets could not be designed to create this requirement if it were required.

People aren't stupid on this Reddit, they can clearly see your referral link.
If you are interested in mining via your GPU/CPUs to earn BTC and other crypto, this posting reviews the most common including HoneyMiner, NiceHash, MinerGate. In all it reviews 10 different alternatives to NiceHash.
And in terms of HoneyMiner, as soon as you overclock your GPU, or use EthLargePill, it becomes unstable and sits there 'mining' with 0 MH/s.. It also pays about the same as NiceHash for GPU mining, but less for CPU mining.
However its Not a scam app, and you can withdraw your BTC from it.

I hate to say this but you are kind of wrong on most of your points:
"It's not widely accepted"
Are you saying the Euro is widely accepted Worldwide? It is obviously not. Where as Bitcoin is accepted in every country in the World (where it is not illegal). You must remember bitcoin is sooo new, and yet the uptake is massive if you compare it to most other similar industrys at the same time period.
"it's volatility has certainly caused issues in the past with merchants"
All currencies are highly volatile sometimes; The £ pound lost 20% (against the $ dollar) in a few days due to Brexit, and this is one of the World's oldest and most trusted and stable currencies.
As we know most currencies/equities slumped after the financial crash. So 'boom and bust' aka Volatility is a natural part of the financial life cycle as it is seen in all markets. Bust meaning slump/bear, not Zero.
Currency, as well as import/export prices change. 20% change after Brexit. This is how the World works, and merchants are used to this. A merchant will just offset their prices to reflect the loss in profit margins. This is completely normal. 
"There is a lot of fraud and lack of protection of its users"
People don't lose money/BTC because of 'bitcoin'. They lose it because of criminals and fraud. No different to people who lose money in cash, gold, shares, or any equity or product. Blaming bitcoin is like blaming a knife because one person did something bad with it. The person is to blame, not the medium used.
Many people would argue the opposite; if fact due to inflation every year you are losing money, in a stable country due to banks. Your £1/$1/Euro1, will be worth less next year than it is today. This is locally. If you try and exchange your local money for another currency then you could lose even more if the exchange rate is bad.

Most of your questions are a bit like asking an average human 'what is your favourite film', and then expecting a single answer.
Idiots think bitcoin is about smashing the banks and replacing the financial system, people with normal IQ realise its just another form of currency/investment which will eventually slot in with all the others; perhaps.
However if all the whales dumped their holdings or if World governments decided to stop it in its tracks, then it would probably become pretty worthless.
Where it actually ends up really depends on who uses it and why, and what businesses accept it, and in which countries this happens, and how their Governments decide to legislate on it.

It is my understanding that the term 'mining empty blocks' means you mine to earn Bitcoin, but don't mine any (other) transactions onto the blockchain. So if all the miners did this they would continue to earn Bitcoins, but no bitcoins could be moved around as the TX would never get included into any blocks.

Obviously; however the real reason, which is what I was asking is because bitmain are moving massive amounts of hashing power from BTC to BCH to fend off a 51% attack over the fork; and because other pools are now mining empty blocks (to generate non-BCH crypto to dump) but not mining transactions onto the ledger.

"The ultra-discreet Principality of Liechtenstein is Europe’s least-visited country, inhabited by the fewest people (population of 37,000) and with very little land (62 square miles), yet there are more registered companies than citizens and it has the highest gross domestic product per person in the world."

Many people use Credit cards to consolidate payments; they have the money, and they pay of the full amount at the end of the month with zero interest.
Additionally anyone willing to take on the debit of a credit card, either way, has the right to decide what they spend their money on. No one else, including you or the Banks have this right.
Banks are not doing to because of potential debit, because you can still gamble or pull out cash and gamble on credit cards. They are doing to to try and damage Bitcoin via FUD. This should be pretty obvious.
Bitcoin is legal in the UK, as is buying it. There is no other legal product here in the UK which the banks have 'banned' you buying with Credit cards. Hence why this is just more FUD from some of the Banks.

As soon as you sign a credit agreement, yes it is your money because it is your debt. Perhaps in India is different but not in the UK (or any other G7 country) 
Indeed you can actually get a cash loan for Product A, but then buy Product B; that is also completely legal here in the UK. Why would it not be as you are entering into a credit agreement, taking on the debit, and therefore it is your money to spend how you will. (Please note that personal finance on a specific product is different).

I think LiteCoin is more likely to be the currency you buy pizza with due to its lower value; And Bitcoin is likely to become a large asset class of equity, like Gold, Diamonds, Platinum, Houses, etc.
What dictates if an asset holds, is if its value increases; buying pizza will do not this. Buying and holding BTC will as that will put demand over supply, the basic premise of value.

I understand very clearly, as I watched the video featuring VanEck, whose ETF we are talking about.
VanEck states quite clearly that each SHARE in the ETF will cost $200K.
The $200K figure was put in as part of the ETF application to the SEC, 6 weeks ago. Obviously the BTC price back then was not $8K.


If you mined or invested in BTC years ago, do you still have to buy them?

If you watch the CNBC video which features one of the companies (VanEck) that applied for the ETF, he made it quite clear that previous ETF applications were refused by the SEC because they were based on Futures, and not the physical asset (Bitcoin).
Therefore you have to ask yourself, do you really think these companies are applying for ETF's without having already acquired the Bitcoin? Of course not. Clearly if and when ETF's are approved from SEC there is NOT going to be a ~~Bear~~ Bull buying streak of BTC from these companies.
Additionally, the whole point of an ETF is it allows institutional investors to invest in an asset/equity without actually having to purchase it. So you could argue that in the short term this is going to lower the amount of BTC purchases as institutional investors can now just buy shares in the ETF instead.

I just set up a Skrill account to buy some BTC/ETH/LTC via Visa/Bank account.
I deposited the money and found the option to buy.
At the time I was on the phone with Customer care and asked "once I buy the Crypto, how do I then transfer it to my external wallet".
The reply was "You cannot transfer the crypto you have just bought out of Skrill".  "It is for trading!"
I asked how much the fees were to buy Crypto. They replied: 3% in total.
I made her aware that there was also a $50 difference in the actual current Bitcoin price, and the price they were displaying.
I then asked where was the proof that the BTC I would have just bought, actually was bought? And is stored somewhere.. I mentioned that normally you would get a blockchain transaction ID.
They replied this is not something they would give.
So not only do you get charged the a huge fee of 3%, but you get sold at a price which is above/below $50, plus after all that you have to take their word it actually exists, with no possibility of ever being able to transfer it to a wallet where you own the private keys.
Not surprisingly, I asked for my deposit back.

We use [coinify.com]( where you can pay with either a Visa card or by Bank transfer. There are no KYC requirements, and It is based in Europe.

I agree with most of what you have said, the UK when it comes to finance always seems to be just slightly one step ahead which is why we have the World's largest financial system, and one of the oldest Banks.
You might want to take a look at RMG (Royal Mint) and RSCoin (Bank of England) that I mention in the comment above.

Yeah I have used Coinify many times over the last couple of years, about 25 trades (buys) so far.
I think it's one of the best places to buy BTC without full KYC requirements using Visa, and it seems to offer fair prices to buy/sell Bitcoin.
The only thing to be aware of is they have a Yearly quota on Buys; I went to buy BTC  yesterday and got told I had reached my years quota.

Question: Do you really think the people trying to launch ETF's have not already bought their BTC, seeing as the SEC refused earlier applications as they were based on Futures, and not physical assets? Its as if people do not really understand that ETF offer an institutional investor a way to invest in BTC without actually having to buy Bitcoin directly.

Ironically, a bit is the smallest divisible portion of a Byte, in computer science language, so actually it fits quite well.
And as you already state, the English language is more than happy to work out the meaning of the same word via its context.
"I cannot fly anymore as my wings are broken said the fly".
"Use polish to make it shine said the polish women".
Would be just two examples.

Yeah I meant Bull not Bear. It was 4am here when I wrote that.
" Each share of the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust is set to cost a hefty $200,000" - As stated by VanECk on CNBC.
If they can price each share then clearly they have already either sourced/bought, or priced, their bitcoin. Additionally the Winklevoss twins were one of the groups who put forward a proposal for a similar bitcoin fund.  And they clearly already have their BTC.
" I would be expecting a 20% jump on the day the ETF is approved. Minimum. Then a steady bull run right up until launch of the ETF. "
I don't see it myself as the Bitcoin price was pretty parabolic even before the Futures market launched.
Personally I see this ETF as more of a way existing BTC whales can liquid their positions into Fiat without hammering the price down.
Time after time we hear, 'bitcoin is going to go into a Bull market after X'.. Consensus was the last time we heard that and nothing came of it.
@_date: 2018-07-24 08:15:23
As I already stated, the ETF application states a $200K share price of the ETF. So how on earth could or would they price this if they did not already own the physical asset?
Bitcoin has jumped from $6K to nearly $8K in the last week or so. Do you really think those trying to launch an ETF would allow for that much risk, based on figures that they had already submitted to the SEC?
And just to be clear, most of the ETF's I have heard of either already own the Bitcoin (long before the ETF application, such as  the Winklevoss twins), or have partnered with those that hold large reserves of Bitcoin.

I guess it's like asking if "stone" is the solution when you are real thirsty; probably not.
@_date: 2018-07-24 04:42:48
Long term it is great news for Bitcoin. It turns Bitcoin into a real stock market traded asset/equity, and like you it say it allows the non-tech to buy it without the hassle and in safety, and lastly as most ETF's you can put into an IRA/ISA, it should have real tax benefits.
You could also argue that if one ETF does very well then many others will be formed, which WOULD then drive new BTC sales as the up and coming ETF's would need Bitcoin.
However I am just trying to make the point to those who think the day any ETF get approved by the SEC there will be an instant Bull run that this is illogical. Medium to Long, for sure. Short term probably not.

Which is better? For Namecheap to use Bitpay and accept bitcoin from some wallets, or for Namecheap to not accept Bitcoin at all?
Without Bitpay, hardly any larger sized decent merchants would accept Bitcoin.
Your argument is like trying to pay in $ using a Visa card on a terminal which only accepts Mastercard.
Just download CoPay or any other BTC wallet that allows you to pay via Bitpay. If you do that then all you have to do is click the link with the wallet open, and it automatically sets it all up ready to send; it then completes the transaction in a few seconds after submitting.
And no, I dont care who owns Bitpay; all I care is that I can buy the things I want, from the places I want, using Bitcoin. Right now Bitpay allows me to do this.
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:34:14
You can pay in Bitcoin or BCash.. So you argument is absurd.
