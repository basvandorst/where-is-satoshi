The dollar is very important. How can I become a millionaire from Bitcoin starting right now? It's too late. For me to become a millionaire through Bitcoin 100 to 1000 people are going to have to become billionaires. Bitcoin may be a commodity but it is a threat to the dollar currency, and ask anybody in the world, nothing challenges the dollar, nothing.

Fiat, inflation, deflation, interest, purchasing power, debt, Treasury, Federal Reserve, reserve requirements, reserve ratio. Read a history book.

So where do we go from here? I, too, have known about Bitcoin for a while. I, too, failed to capitalize. I, too, sold too early. I, too, by right, should be a millionaire. 
At this point, if I can make five times my money, I'll be happy. I think here at $80, a person making five times their money is the best we can hope for considering what we are up against.
We have to remember what happened to Bitcoin in the past; it crashed. No one wanted to touch it with a ten foot pole.

It hurts, the emotional pain is real. This was OUR chance to be RICH. No inheritance, no business plan, no record deal, no lottery ticket, no website, no degree, no commute, no programming language, no brokerage, no COPS, no guns. A million dollars, no paperwork. This was it.
This is what Eminem was rapping about.
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
excuse me, Im gonna go buy some weed.
