I do live in one of those areas where prices have been rising considerably. And, it seems like prices have been rising for about 17-20 years. 
The other thing worth mentioning, even in lieu of the new tax plan, is the interest deduction. 
The counterpoint, as you correctly pointing out, is buying in an area with poor returns and high taxes. I though about buying my grandparent's house in Wisconsin. It was reasonably priced and a block from Lake Michigan but the taxes were breathtaking. If I lived in MI or WI I would rent forever. The taxes make owning impossible.

It does very much depend on where you live, but a house is really the only leveraged investment average people can make. 
If you buy a 100k house with 10k down and it appreciates 10% in one year, you've essentially doubled your investment. Other than cryptos, that's a pretty rare ROI.

I think we're getting to the point where institutional investors are becoming quite interested. They are the slimiest individuals on the planet. These are the nyc banker guys who would rip your heart out for a nickel. They'll do anything they can to buy at much lower prices. Start rumors, buy just to sell at lower levels and cause a panic. They will be trying over the next year, very aggressively to knock the price down to shake out all the weak hands. Make a plan and stick to it. Dollar cost average for the next two years. Buy each week or month on a certain day. I can nearly guarantee that you'll be in at a lower cost basis than 11k. 
I remember the feeling of urgency back in 2013 to buy as it approached 1k. Chart looked very similar. It went parabolic just like it is now. We hit 1100 something and then over the next year, 2014, we went back down to 200. So if you thought at the end of 2013 that you had to back up the truck, you were way off. You did OK looking at today's prices but you could have made a killing by waiting a year or DCA'ing in.

This won't look that insane soon. Imagine when every fund needs to have BTC in it to look diversified. That's what's coming. Billions if not trillions chasing this now.

I can't say that I'd be feeling very patient if an entity was withholding 1.8 million dollars of my money.

We're either at denial or panic. Definitely, nowhere near capitulation.

GBTC is currently trading at 13% of its all time high. 
BTC is currently trading at 23% of its all time high.

I agree. Imo we need to see some pain just under 5k. I think we've yet to see the shake-out of weak hands.

I asked a 22 yo yesterday. He had never even heard of bitcoin. I was shocked.
