I’m not sure I follow. Are you referring to Kwatt?

This entire market/industry has been based on speculation. Potential instability of a major exchange could force negative reactions on the market. 
On the other hand, nobody fucking knows. That’s why you will see “buy the rumor, sell the news” all over this place.

Release of Bitcoin LN on main net. This is fundamental and very exciting news.

There simply is not enough merchants who accept bitcoin. Lightning is not wide spread, and fees and waiting time are unrealistic. There is no ease of use (yet).
While the future of cryptos is certainly unpredictable, I would venture that adoption of bitcoin (or perhaps another cojn) will become mainstream with the next 3-5 years. 
P.S. Preemptively: I know about a handful of major retailers who accept crypto, but this is no where near mass adoption.

Please check your message, I believe there is a tremendous need to make hedging accessible to the general bitcoin community.

The future of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency are obviously  linked to energy consumption and thus a reduction in energy costs should stimulate BTC growth. 
I’ve personally invested in a company called 4NEW which will launch KWATT coin and have interest in KWH coin, although I personally despise John Mcafee. Both have a very ambitious implementation prospectus, but I believe that they will be massively successful because of the direct correlation between blockchain and energy consumption. Also an interesting way to cause disruption a field which is suffering due to middlemen and centralization.
A year ago, I wouldn’t even consider either coin, but in this rapidly developing sector, I actually believe they have a chance of success. I’d really appreciate some other input and thoughts on the projects.

To reduce energy costs to end users by taking out middlemen who up charge at absurd rates. And accessibility to affordable energy is a necessity for the mining and blockchain development.
Agreed, this does not address the problem of pollution and renewable resources. But it does create a workable  solution in today’s real world. The ICO’s focused on solar and renewable energy are not going to be feasible in the foreseeable future. Not with the state of the world as it is.
