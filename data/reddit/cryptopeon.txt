You get an equal share of bch, so 1 bch if you had 1 btc. You will not get this at coinbase until they have bch on their exchange. Rumors are it is coming soon. 1-2-2018 are the rumors I heard.

I disagree, why would cloud mining ever be better? Why would someone setup a miner and let you buy all the profits? They wouldn't, they are taking advantage of you incase the market corrects but still take profits even if it doesn't. Its win, win for them, its risk, lose for you.

Hold on and you will see, look at all the dips in btc's entire history, they were all temporary and this one is no different. 1 week or less you will be happy you held

I used to use blockfolio, but they have delayed uploads of some exchanges,  I use Delta now, I like it better.

Very nice, well worth the time it took to read.

Don't get me wrong, I love the free market :-)

I bet 80% of the people buying TVs at Best Buy are spending money they can't afford to loose. The free market has trained people to spend money they don't have. Unfortunately I am one of them LOL

Sweet advice man, thank you

HODL like a mofo. And don't babysit your investment. Wish I could take my own advice, I am a very impatient man and constantly feel like I need to move my investment around to gain more. I have this uncontrollable urge to micromanage all day long when I know it's best to go about my life not thinking about it. Wish I could set a 1 year timer and forget until then.

I am not experienced enough to help a lot but I can tell you GPU mining isn't earning squat at the moment. You will need to mine and hold until prices get higher to make any profits. I have 3 ASICs and 1 gaming computer with a single 1060 6gb card and I haven't found a good way to mine with it other than with nicehash. Every tutorial on gpu mining assumes it is a dedicated rig. Hope someone can help you with that part of it so you don't have to reboot to a different drive everytime you need to use the computer.

I have no reason to believe you are right except that I really want you to be. Come on big money!!!

HitBtc in my opinion, they seem to lock up the wallets of coins when I wanted to trade them the most.

I bought ED medication in Oct 2017 from some other country and they offered 33% savings plus the free btc coinbase was offering new accounts. Been hooked every since.

If it is offline it isn't mining, therefore there will be no heat, get them mining and you will have heat.
