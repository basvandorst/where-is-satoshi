Also, if anyone has any ideas to spread the word, I'm all ears. I'll be posting an ad on FB tomorrow, and hitting some forums I frequent, but that's it.

I messaged you on FB. :)

satoshi, you need beans, or a company to come brew at an event?
@_date: 2014-06-23 20:52:38
Good job! You have the Kyocera hand grinder? Just curious...

Got my first Bitcoin order today, roasted this morning, shipping now! 
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:04:00
I wonder if they can move it... 
@_date: 2014-06-23 04:47:29
Thanks to both of you! Datniche, if you want to order, try 'reddit' for 15% off. Ill be roasting tomorrow, shipping the same day. 
@_date: 2014-06-23 22:19:53
Excellent idea, thank you!

Thank you, ajv! We do our best, which ain't too shabby! :)

I use FB a lot. I actually did target a campaign about accepting bitcoin, yesterday. Still running. It's (supposedly) been seen by a LOT more people than my average 'friends of friends' campaign. I say 'supposedly', because more than half of me thinks those FB stats are pure BS, designed solely to separate me from my money...

The optimal period is days 3-14 out of the roaster, but it'll still be substantially better than anything you'll buy at most places for a month or so. If you don't think you'll use it in 2-3 weeks, you can put half in a freezer bag and freeze it, use the other half lb, and pull the frozen beans out when the first half is gone. Freezing works well, the problem is that most people freeze ground coffee (you should always grind only before brewing), and then they pull it out of the freezer every day to make coffee, which introduces fresh air, and a whole lot of moisture into the bag. :)

All my coffees are full pounds, 16oz, none of this 12oz nonsense that's currently en vogue. My favorite? Straight up, this is the best lineup I've ever had. All are very, very high scoring coffees, all exceptional. I only have around 8lbs of Mexico left, so it might be worth jumping on.

Ah, thanks! I'm not wise to the ways of reddit yet. Good tip! 
@_date: 2014-06-23 06:47:33
I'll leave it up through Tues!

Where's @_date: 2014-06-23 22:39:55
So the Bitcoin order someone placed today showed on my site, but under 'awaiting payment', so I logged into BIPS, and looked at my account. Next to the order, it said in bold 'WAITING'. So I waited a few hours, nothing changed, but when I looked again, if I clicked the order, a bar came up saying 'IPS was not sent, would you like to resend?'. Being a curious guy, I thought 'what can happen?', and clicked it. Shortly after, the order showed up on my site in the regular queue.
What's up with that?

Hi, dsade!
