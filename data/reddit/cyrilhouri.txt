Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

In order to prevent that from happening, you can decide to only do business with reputable buyers who have had several successful transactions before.

For the "spending bitcoins" part, it's different than snapcard because:
1)  it's decentralized. Snapcard take all the orders and execute them on their own while with Brawker, the order is executed by another user.
2) Since there is someone else on the other side of the trade, you can decide of your own Bitcoin rate. So while Snapcard takes a 0.5% cut, with Brawker you can get a discount rate of up to 20% (i.e. negative fee)
Are you in?

How do I send cash across the Internets?

Right, let's talk # of users:
* Discover: $28B: who uses that?
* Yahoo: $37.8B who still uses Yahoo?
* Groupon: $4.2B: who still uses that?

That's correct. The bitcoins are held in escrow until there is evidence that the item was paid for or shipped. If there is a dispute, then there is an arbitration mechanism in place.

Hey Aaron!
Thanks :-) 
I hope all is well for you.

In addition to the built-in fraud prevention system, there's a rating system just like on eBay. When I posted this order, I had 10 users who placed a bid on it. This allowed me to pick the user with the highest number of positive ratings.

Yes, but like I said, it's the merchant who foots the bill, not the bank. The bank may even earn a fee in that process.

No, they still accept it:
Why would they stop accepting it since it's the only way to get paid with an 100% guarantee (no credit card fraud possible)?

I was the one in charge of Brawker at that time. The reality of what happened is much simpler than what people are making out of it: we were getting a handful of orders a day, which at a 2% commission, doesn't pay for the bills and salaries. So we just decided to shut it down and everyone went their own way.
As for open-sourcing the code, everyone was already busy looking for a job so we didn't really find the time to do it.

Great idea!

They were able pull it off with "The Social Network". And we can't really say things are moving slow over there.
