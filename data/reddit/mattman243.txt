Yeah, I've actually got a ledger wallet on the way, and it'll be here before the fork. I just wanted to understand both sides before I committed to one or the other. Thanks for the reply.

Thanks for the update anyway! Sorry for the empty treasure chest.

That's where I was headed logically. So, it's a complete copy once the fork happens, right? 1:1 on both chains?

What you have is a US Debit card. If it's tied to a bank account (checking/savings) and has a pin, it's a debit card. If it doesn't have a pin and isn't tied to a bank account, it's a credit card.
Debit cards can be used like credit cards, but require you to have money in your account upfront to cover the transaction. Credit cards can be used even if you don't have a cent to your name. Then they charge you interest if you don't pay them for the credit they extended to you!

You're pretty close with your edit, except that the term "debit can be used as credit" is not factually correct by the definition of the word "credit".
So, lets back up a sec. You cannot use a debit card "as credit". You can use both a debit card and a credit card to pay for items using a piece of plastic instead of handing over physical cash. Both are alternative methods of paying for things you purchase. They happen to look similar because they both use a plastic card. Other than that, they are almost completely different.
Credit cards allow you to use a piece of plastic to pay for things with money that you DON'T have. Debit cards allow you to use a piece of plastic to pay for things with money that is currently sitting in your bank account.
A debit card is the same as if you were using cash or a check. They all require you to hold money at the time. A debit card is playing with someone else's money until you pay it off.

Wooooooooooooow. This is what I didn't understand about the replay stuff. Thank you for spelling it out simply. I mean, I'm planning on hodling anyway, but it's fascinating.

He's gone. Probably had millions in there and he doesn't care enough about us to come back here. :(

So, the last fork (bitcoin cash) caused everyone who held their bitcoin private keys to have X coins of each currency. So, if you held 10 bitcoin at the time of the fork, you would also have 10 bitcoin cash in that same wallet/address. So, people were able to sell off their bitcoin cash at $300+ a pop while still hodling their regular bitcoin. But depending on who you ask, this fork won't be handled the same way because of the way x2 has been coded.
