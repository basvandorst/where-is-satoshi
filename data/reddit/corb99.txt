Yeah good point. Should have changed that in the video itself. Too late now.

Understood. And thanks for your support. And the dark web guy, yeh classic. We have a lot more material from that day, so maybe we'll publish an extended version later.

Hi. I've been in the bitcoin world for a few years now and assume a lot of things. That's why I thought it would be refreshing to just ask random but different types of people on the street if they knew bitcoin, if they could describe it and whether they had any. Holland is probably one of the countries where a lot of people at least have heard about it. And that appeared to be true. Around 50%. I think this video is not only funny, but also interesting for all of us bitcoiners to better understand how regular people see bitcoin.

Not true. We asked around 40 people, 20 people heard of it. A big selection of those 20 we put in the video.

There are subtitles. Just activate captions in YouTube. They aren't optimal though, but will improve them.

Thanks for the feedback. Added it to that page too.

good point. We should/could have put it in the video. I now put it in the description. None of the ones that knew bitcoin had them. Only this one guy used to have them.

he said 'loop' (you can hear him say it) so we kept it in

Thanks for the feedback. Really appreciated! We talked to 40 people on the street. 20 of them had heard of bitcoin. Most of them you see on the video. We will probably release a 7 min fulll video later starring more of them.
